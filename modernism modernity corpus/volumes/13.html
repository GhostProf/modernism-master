The critical clich&#x000E9; of the autonomous aesthetic modernist object has long since been displaced by the historical examination of modernism as theory and practice. However, critics have too often seemed compelled to choose between the Scylla of cultural criticism and the Charybdis of aesthetic experience.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In one, the work of art appears as a relic of privilege, wilfully detached from social history and significant only insofar as details of the world can be read through the work; in the other, the work of art is accountable only to itself and its own aesthetic tradition.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Yet as Stephen Daedalus demonstrates of Shakespeare in Joyce's most ambitiously historical work<i>, Ulysses</i>, history is grist to the artist's mill; the work of art is both deeply implicated in the historic moment and asserts a critical difference from it.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  The nature of that difference has become a preoccupation for a more recent return to problems of aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  How do we bridge the difference between the aesthetic and the historical, between the world of the novel and the world the novel claims to represent, without reducing the novel to a simple historical artefact or reifying it into a transcendentally aesthetic object? How do writers like Joyce mediate between word and world, both asserting autonomy and maintaining connection?<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A small moment in the "Ithaca" chapter of <i>Ulysses</i> dramatizes the encounter between the real world and the world of the novel, even as it challenges the rigidity of that distinction. Bloom turns on a tap to fill a teakettle. The narrator asks of the water, "Did it flow?," and instead of then simply presenting an answer to that question, traces the water back through the pipes all the way to its source.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  By doing so, Joyce rejects the imaginary spectacle 

<b></b>

of water coming from the tap as a creation <i>ex nihilo</i> and the autonomy of the literary work, and insists on tracing the object back to its origins&#x02014;an origin that, like a drop of water in the ocean, ultimately dissolves into itself and is untraceable. This essay will not attempt the Herculean task of charting all of the mentions of waste and water in Ulysses, a task akin to mucking out the Augean stables or draining the sea. Instead, I will examine evocations of water and waste in <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;inflows and outflows&#x02014;as a means of exploring the elusive interplay between world and word, between the historical pipes and privies of turn of the century Dublin and the imagined ones of Joyce's text. Water and waste are not simply tropes for aesthetic production in Joyce's work, although this is one of their functions. Treating water and waste solely as a reflexive metaphor detaches them from historic referent and source, and I argue that when Joyce contemplates both of these forms he is speculating on the relationship between aesthetics and history, between artistic and social production. Joyce limns the outlines of a world where something always comes from something else, a world that leads us back, like water through pipes, to an origin both beckoning and necessarily elusive.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ulysses</i> tends to reject the idea of an original product, or a product without history, and instead embeds both the subjects and objects of the world in the history of their origin, their making, and their repeated iterations.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The sourcing of the water from the tap to the Roundwood reservoir is symptomatic of the historical insistence of the text. Water does not merely flow from a tap; it comes through pipes and tanks, a subterranean system of delivery that creates the illusion of water appearing from nothing. In general, <i>Ulysses</i> as text insists that nothing comes from nothing and emphasizes the materiality of the tactile, lived world. Despite the novel's numerous and heralded departures from realism, this emphasis on material, origin, and source constitutes a sophisticated variant on realist technique, one that not only insists that the novel's characters, like us, need to go to the bathroom and buy their breakfast, but also that we live in a world in which objects, like novels, tend to have their origins occluded. Joyce responds to this tendency with an emphasis on the material qualities of object and text. If you want a kidney for breakfast you need to go to the store and buy it; if you purchase a bar of soap and slip it in your pocket, its smell stays with you the entire day. And if you want to write a modern epic, you have the reservoir of Western (and a sprinkling of Eastern) tradition and literature to draw upon, as well as the trusty <i>Thom's Dublin Directory</i>, the source of Joyce's information on the water source of Dublin.
</p>

<p>
As Robert Adams Day points out, "<i>Ulysses</i> is in a state of saturation" . Not only is, as again Day writes, "realistic fiction about Dublin bound to have rivers and canals in it" , but Joyce appropriates what Day terms the AquaCities of his native city for the verbal, metaphorical, and material flows of his text. Water becomes a kind of master metaphor for the economies of circulation of the novel.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Flow is also central to the material elements to which the book returns again and again: it evokes river, canal, and ocean, water and urine, semen, and finally menstrual blood. Water exemplifies the protean transmigrations so crucial to the novel's themes and structures; the ode to water mentions its many metamorphoses and, with a wink to the reader, "its infallibility as paradigm and paragon" (Joyce 549). But, as Derek Attridge argues in his 

<b></b>

discussion of Molly's flow, critical attention to "flow" in <i>Ulysses</i> has too often lapsed into ahistorical romantic readings that do not always take into account the historical complexity of the text. In relation to Molly's monologue, Attridge demonstrates that the "freeflow" of her internal monologue is anything but free; he argues that the both the syntax and preoccupations of her monologue are surprisingly conventional, and that they draw attention to the historical limitations and preoccupations of women in early twentieth-century Dublin rather than personifying some essential and essentializing vision of <i>&#x000E9;criture f&#x000E9;minine</i>. He writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It is possible, that is, to read <i>Ulysses</i> as a text in which, on the one hand, the cultural stereotype of the female flow is foregrounded, literalized, demystified, and parodied; while on the other a more potent ungendered flow&#x02014;or set of flows&#x02014;operates throughout the text to erode the cultural and ideological barriers between the sexes.

<p class="noIndent">
The water supply is a similarly potent flow which, rather than eroding the barriers between the sexes, erodes the boundary between the natural and cultural, the city and the country, the communal and the privately owned. The seemingly conventional and prosaic tour of the Dublin water supply has often been overshadowed by the subsequent protean, near-ecstatic ode to water, where Bloom "waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier" admires water for qualities ranging from its mythic implications to its physical mutability. While other critics have emphasized the aesthetic and metaphoric implications of water in Joyce's corpus, I want instead to juxtapose this euphoric flow of ideas with the earlier, more mundane flow of the water through the pipes of early twentieth-century Dublin as Bloom turns on his tap.
</p>

<p>
To return to the passage under discussion: after the keyless Bloom breaks into his own home in the penultimate chapter of <i>Ulysses</i>, he performs a few acts of hospitality for his guest, Stephen Daedalus. He draws up two chairs, lights a fire in the grate, and finally Bloom turns on the kitchen tap to fetch water to boil in his kettle. What happens when he does this is quite amazing: the water flows. This may not seem particularly impressive or surprising, either on Joyce's part or on Bloom's. The fact that water flows when we turn on a tap meets rather than jars our expectations. However, by calling attention to this mundane action Joyce points us to the possibility that water will not flow, raising the spectre of impediment in the text. He also foregrounds the effect of realism of the novel, in which taps are turned on and water flows, as well as the possibility that the novel will not behave like the world. Thus, neatly and at once, the novel employs realist conventions but by emphasizing them, calls their reliability into question. Finally, the question highlights the near miraculous and immediate quality of contemporary life, where water appears from taps rather than laboriously being carried from wells.
</p>

<p>
Frederic Jameson gestures towards this passage at the end of his famous essay "<i>Ulysses</i> in History," writing, "to the vitalist ideology of Molly's better known final affirmation, I tend to prefer this one" . Jameson favours this passage because it rejects the reified, disconnected logic of capitalism and instead re-inserts human labour 

<b></b>

and production. The objects of the city are traced back "less to its origins in nature, than to the transformation of Nature by human and collective praxis deconcealed" . Tracing water from the pipes in turn traces an entire, often hidden, realm of human activity and need. As opposed to the later passage, which begins the Ode to Water celebrating "Its universality" (Joyce 549), water is anything but universal here; it belongs to a particular time, place, and mode of passage, is measured and collected, transmitted and received. It can be measured by the distance it travels, by the cost of the pipes that carry it&#x02014;finally, by its cost to the city and its residents. The "yes" of the passage&#x02014;here flat and affirmative, rather than ecstatic and abandoned, as it will be at the end of Molly's monologue&#x02014;is elaborated, at length, for the reader:

This is a description that would suit an engineer.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Still, as unadorned and seemingly literal as the description is, it does seem to retain a certain pleasure in appropriating a largely technical language for a literary text. Both "Roundwood Reservoir" and "cubic capacity" have not only an alliterative but also a nearly onomatopoeic resonance. More commonly known as the prosaic Vartry waterworks, Roundwood reservoir fills the mouth in a way that evokes depth and moisture, an effect that certainly would have been deliberate for a writer so famously sensitive to sound. Percolating comes as a surprising verb in the second clause, bringing us back to the kettle on Bloom's stove and creating a kind of double focus in the text, where we see both the kitchen and the countryside that lies far beyond it. The passage also glories in the place-names of the surrounding countryside, names that carry their own mystique even as they are evoked almost in passing. They shimmer, half-claimed, on the edges of the narrative. One can only imagine Joyce's delight in a name like "Stillorgan." The effect is reminiscent of the paper flowers opening in water at the end of the Overture in Marcel Proust's <i>Du C&#x000F4;t&#x000E9; de Chez Swann</i>; the countryside opens up, flowers as it is named, though fleetingly. Indeed, in the urban landscape that Joyce charts, food and water are the links to the surrounding countryside. The milkwoman provokes in Stephen a thought that is the closest the text gets to pastoral, "Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field" (Joyce 12). County Wicklow, known as the garden of Ireland, supplies the city with water and sustenance; Dublin responds with waste, excess, subterfuge, greed, as we will see in the continuation of the passage. Even as the water supply is traced and contextualized, Dublin finds its context in a larger Ireland.
</p>

<p>
Joyce's decision to trace the waterworks is particularly interesting because waterworks have always been the sign and the condition of advanced development in an 

<b></b>

urban context. As Dora P. Crouch writes, "Attention to water supply and drainage is the sine qua non for urbanization, and hence for that human condition we call civilization" . Sextus Julius Frontinus' treatise on the aqueducts of first century Rome, <i>De Aquis</i> provides both a stylistic model and an exalted precedent for Joyce's digression into the waterways. Frontinus claims the Aqueducts of Rome as the most advanced products of an advanced civilization, and distinguishes between their monumental utility and other, lesser, purely aesthetic achievements. "Will anybody compare the idle Pyramids, or these other useless though much renowned works of the Greeks, with these aqueducts, with these many indispensable structures?" . Frontinus lays out the elements of his examination, "I will first put down the names of the waters which are brought to the city of Rome; then by what persons, and under what consuls, and in what year . . . how far they were carried in underground channels . . . how much each aqueduct brings" . We see Joyce similarly naming the waters, their passage, and their volume. Frontinus' catalogue, informative and exalting in turn, is the first to lay out the elements of a city's water system in great detail, but it also acts as a microhistory of the use of water in Rome, as a legal text, and in brief moments, as an encomium. Cities, Frontinus seems to argue, live or die according to the integrity of their water supply; the waterworks are the most significant monuments of a great civilization, and indeed, form an element of the conditions of production of other great works of art.
</p>

<p>
We might trace the preoccupation with water supply back even further, to the ancient Greeks. In Homer's <i>Odyssey, </i>after Odysseus has returned to Ithaca but does not recognize his homeland because Athene has "poured a mist over all" (13; 190), Athene identifies Ithaca as a country with "watering places good through the seasons" (13; 247). Later in the narrative when Odysseus approaches the city, the narrator pauses at the city's fountain and enters into a brief description of its appearance and origin:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
Now as they went down over the stony road, and were coming
<br />
Close to the city, and had arrived at the fountain, sweet-running 
<br />
And made of stone; and there the townspeople went for their water; 
<br />
Ithakos had made this, and Neritos, and Polyktor; 
<br />
And around it was a grove of black poplars, trees that grow by 
<br />
Water, all in a circle, and there was cold water pouring 
<br />
Down from the rock above; over it had been built an altar
<br />
Of the nymphs, and there all the wayfarers made their sacrifice

<p class="noIndent">
The fountain marks the border of and entrance to the city. The fountain's architects are invoked by name, and thereby honoured in the text, and the fountain itself represents a convergence of natural, man-made, and religious forces. It fills a practical, social, and ritual function, and will soon prove the location of Odysseus' altercation with Melanthios the goatherd. As he sees Odysseus unjustly attacked, Eumaios offers a brief prayer to the nymphs of the fountain. Fritz Senn points to this brief digression, and notes, "Intertextually, Joyce's prolonged pause by the wayside flows out of the Ithacan springs" . The flow of water in the text is also historical in this sense, since it runs not only forward but backward to acknowledge its predecessors. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Turn-of-the-century Dublin was behind many of the other great European cities in sewage disposal, trash cleanup, and had corresponding high rates of illness and mortality. The Vartry waterworks in county Wicklow, constructed in 1868, were one of the few municipal triumphs of the city of Dublin, and even in 1904 the easy availability of clean water was not to be taken for granted. Joseph O'Brien points out that before the waterworks were constructed, water was drawn from the city's many canals. He writes, "The potability of the supply must have been suspect to those who lacked faith in the effectiveness of filtration to remove the noxious effect of bilge water from manure carrying canal boats or the carcasses of cats and dogs" . According to one clergyman, O'Brien writes, the pollution of the water supply was responsible for alcoholism among the poor.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Even after the installation of the waterworks, thousands of tenement homes lacked an indoor tap or even an outdoor water supply, relying on water from public fountains that ran only sporadically. Bloom's access to flow&#x02014;his indoor tap&#x02014;locates him above the poor of early twentieth-century Dublin, even as his lack of a watercloset puts him below the rich and the upper-middle classes.
</p>

<p>
While qualities of flow have often been emphasized in Joyce's language, it is also important to note that Joyce disrupts flow as often as he invokes it, and for a purpose. When we look at the language of the passage, it clearly does not flow but is deliberately clunky and digressive. The passage on the Roundwood reservoir is written in the stiff, deliberately heavy pseudo-scientific jargon of much of the rest of the chapter. On its way, it incorporates the language of bureaucrats and lawyers&#x02014;Mr Spencer Harty, borough surveyor, who prohibits use of water for purposes other than consumption, and Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, whose letter on behalf of the Dublin waterworks committee was published in the Irish Independent, June 15, 1904. The conditional "though" introduces the disruption of the water supply:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 121/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyer and waterworks engineer, Mr. Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable waters of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr. Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.

As Mark Osteen points out, the mention of the South Dublin Guardians and of the drought raises the spectre of scarcity and of improper usage. We are told that in 1904, tap water use was restricted for the purposes of consumption, and are also told that the South Dublin guardians have been abusing their supply. Osteen writes:

Here the universal and transcendent quality of water is stopped, on the one hand, by public officers, and, on the other hand, by public services&#x02014;the South Dublin guardians who have mysteriously misplaced 20,000 gallons of water a night "notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons a day per pauper." The language of the passage is cluttered with bureaucratic, periphrastic statements, and passive language&#x02014;"for which reason," "for purposes other than," "recourse being had to," "notwithstanding," "thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public." This Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce type of legal squabbling leaves us quite confused about agency and origin. Water is disappearing, but we're not sure why; something is being done about it, but we're not sure what; somebody is acting on behalf of someone else. To paraphrase Dickens, we think there's a fraud somewhere in the room, but we can't positively say that we have got it. The provision of clean water, as a public service and public good, was from the first subject to misuse. Frontinus' treatise comes down heavily on fraud, writing with disapproval, "the public watercourses are brought to a standstill by private citizens"  and evoking a litany of complaints familiar to any water commissioner, including the overwatering of private gardens. As he harnesses water for the public good, Frontinus also submits it to ownership and control. Elsewhere, Bloom speculates, "How can you own water really?"(Joyce 126). Similarly, in the ode to water he celebrates its universality, ubiquity, and democracy. One might suppose water belonged to everyone and no one, neverchanging, everchanging. It does not. The text here resists water as metaphor, evoking instead water as commodity, subject to scarcity, fraud, and control. Perhaps this inability to flow is another way of noting the register of the real.
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that for all of Joyce's evocation of realism in this passage, the spectre of scarcity is in fact invented. While the description of the waterworks of Dublin is in most points accurate, Joyce fabricates the drought of 1904&#x02014;Don Gifford points out that the summer of 1904 was average Irish weather, and therefore, as Gifford puts it, "far from dry" . The fictional drought allows Joyce to juxtapose scarcity with the idea of water as excess. Joyce also subtly changes the terminus of the water supply, ending the tanks at the city boundary instead of in central Dublin, where they ended according to the Dublin directory. Ending the water supply infrastructure at the city boundary emphasizes the difference between the city and its environs, a difference fluidly bridged by the passage of water. Perhaps more crucially, these fictional revisions allow Joyce to invoke history even as he masters it. Like Daedalus' version of Shakespeare, Joyce spatchcocks an actual reservoir to a fictional drought and cuts off a system of pipes at the edge of the city, leaving their ghostly, actual counterparts to meander to the city's centre.
</p>

<p>
Another common and central public use of water is, of course, for bathing, and Bloom punctuates his day with a bath. Bloom is a waterlover, as opposed to Stephen the hydrophobe, and Stephen's refusal to bathe in the Forty Foot pool at the beginning of the novel is contrasted by Bloom, who seeks out the public baths, an act unusual 

<b></b>

enough that Joyce wondered if it might surprise the reader. Aside from his donation at Paddy Dignam's funeral, the bath is his largest expense of the morning, and seems one of his greatest pleasures. He looks forward to it with anticipation and remembers it with satisfaction. Bloom's interest in hygiene and pleasure in bathing is a paradoxical mark of his Judaism. His immersion is thematically linked to immersion in a <i>mikvah</i>, a Jewish ritual bath. It is worthwhile to note that the Tara Street baths opened in 1885, but in 1897 the Corporation added a plunge bath or <i>mikvah</i> for the use of Jewish women. Immersion in a <i>mikvah</i> marks the transition between a state of ritual purity and impurity. More significantly for the purposes of this narrative, it marks a transition from a period of menstruation and abstinence, for seven days after the cessation of the menstrual cycle, and the beginning of a period of sexual intercourse and fertility. <i>Tumah</i>, or ritual impurity, is timed to end approximately around the period of ovulation; the combination of the end of a period of enforced abstinence and of ovulation obviously encourages conception. From the standpoint of the Dublin health committee, the <i>mikvah</i> ritual seemed to "have a beneficial effect on the procreativeness of the Jewish female, and goes far to account for her healthy offspring" (O'Brien 102). Hygiene, fertility, and ritual were linked in the minds of the health committee and perhaps in the minds of the public, and valued to such an extent that in 1914, when the baths of the city were closed due to a water shortage, the <i>mikvah</i> remained open. Although, as Neil Davison points out, Joyce "consciously created Bloom as one who is not <i>Halachically </i>Jewish" , there is a suggestive overlap between his bath and the <i>mikvah</i>, used for ritual immersion.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Molly and Bloom have been in a kind of <i>nidda</i>, or period of abstinence, for years. The language that describes his bath raises similar tropes of fertility in heavily biblical language:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The language of this passage mimics the biblical covenant with Abraham, where a future is promised and foreseen that Abraham will never himself actually experience. At the same time, the promise of fertility is complicated or undermined by the adjective "limp." This parodic invocation of Bloom the patriarch is further underlined by his inability to be fertile, to produce another child, despite the literal fulfillment of this promise in the Circe chapter.
</p>

<p>
Certainly, the mythic and romantic implications of water are still important in the text, and numerous characters, including Bloom himself, show themselves to be fully susceptible to these implications. When Bloom sees a rowboat floating an advertisement down the river, he wonders if the owner pays rent to the corporation. He then speculates in a Heraclitean mode, "How can you own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream" (Joyce 126). These same themes are later picked up and extended in the Ithacan Ode to 

<b></b>

Water. The motif of flux and of stability in flux is crucial in the narrative, from Stephen's speculations on the weaving and unweaving of Mother Dana to Bloom's thoughts on the water that flows from the tap. Bloom's thinking is pro-entrepreneurial though anti-corporate, and he drifts into romantic speculation only briefly. His first thought on seeing the advertisement on the rowboat is "Good idea that" . He follows up his rather more philosophic observations on the flow of water with the more practical "All kinds of places are good for ads" . Bloom isn't protesting the use of water for "filthy" advertising, but is celebrating this use, and indeed, even in the ode to water, one of the reasons water is celebrated is for its many uses. Water is at once essential and historical, limitless and scarce, natural and cultural.
</p>

<p>
Bloom glimpses the rowboat with the advertisement for trousers from O'Connell Bridge, where he has paused to feed the gulls. The sight of the river evokes a series of thoughts; first of suicide, though this passes quickly, then of the passing seagulls. He throws a crumpled ball of paper into the water, which the seagulls wisely ignore. He remembers a piece of verse about seagulls, a commonplace couplet that, according to Gifford, is of Bloom's own composition . Then he contrasts this with Shakespeare's style of writing, which he calls, significantly, "the flow of the language" (Joyce 125). The piece of Shakespeare that comes to mind is, "Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit/ Doomed for a time to walk the earth" . The language flow here is deliberate, multidirectional, and canny. The Shakespeare quotation comes to mind because Bloom has just thought of suicide, evoking his own father's unquiet spirit. It also prepares the way for Stephen, the Hamlet re in the text, whom Bloom has yet to encounter. Language flow in the text moves both forward and backward and is both nostalgic and anticipatory. The novel disrupts the unidirectional, progressive movement of plot in order to chart a story that simultaneously moves into the past and future. While the novel employs the framework of temporal progress through a single day&#x02014;a wink to Aristotelian unities&#x02014;the use of time is more reminiscent of epic than of Aristotelian tragedy.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  <i>The Odyssey</i> wanders, like its protagonist; the use of stories within stories, and the narrative collapsing, and expansion of time balance the end-point of the text with an expansive circularity that has clearly been shown to be a model for Bloom's homecoming and Joyce's narrative strategies. Perhaps it is appropriate that both are stories of sea-dwelling nations; the ocean, matching its gains with losses daily along the shore, forms a model for non-linear motion.
</p>

<p>
These bits of quotation in the text also form a kind of collective unconscious, and like the ball of paper Bloom sends floating down the Liffey to try to fool the gulls, are significant but somehow not fully assimilated. Walking along the sands of infinite possibility in Sandymount Strand, Stephen speculates, "These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here" (Joyce 37).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In saying this, he refers to the detritus washed up along the beach&#x02014;dead dog, porter bottle. But language, too, is like this detritus and silt, a repository of objects old and new, treasured and forgotten. This dead language, in contemporary terms, does not degrade; instead it undergoes its own seachanges.

paper Stephen leaves on the rock, the story Bloom uses to wipe himself&#x02014;and at the same time, is a little more sterile.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The gulls are far more enthusiastic about the crumbs of Banbury cake Bloom sends into the water than they are about the piece of paper Bloom throws in as a tease, and as he feeds them Bloom imagines himself, briefly, as a beneficent and unexpected God, "They never expected that. Manna" (Joyce 126). Books and writing are demystified, while the body itself seems to be the repository of tremendous power. Sitting in the outhouse, Bloom wipes himself with a "prize story" but speculates that his excrement could nourish a garden.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The sourced, materialist imagination that I emphasize here is also in evidence in other parts of the text. Bloom's shopping trip involves tracking down and cooking food in a modern, bourgeois rendition of the contemporary hunter-gatherer; his fantasy of labourless production in Israel&#x02014;"Orangegroves and immense melonfields"&#x02014;is clearly marked as such and is contrasted with the vision of a "barren land, bare waste" (Joyce 49). Similarly, when the milkwoman delivers milk, the text mentions that the milk is "not hers," displacing one source for another. The text is at once conscious of material origin as well as of the capitalist apparatus of delivery and dissemination, and its coexistence alongside older models of delivery, like the milkwoman who at once evokes and dispels traditional Ireland.

<p>
Outflows are certainly as significant as inflows in this famously excremental novel. We might note the garbage on the beach as Stephen walks, and the ubiquity of undigested thoughts and pieces of text in the novel. Here, too, is an element of the real that does not flow but remains occluded, insistent, and obstructive. Then there is sewage. As a city, Dublin was much more adept at managing the inflow of water than the outflow of sewage. As O'Brien writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
When James Joyce left Dublin the Liffey's waters still bore away all manner of offal, sluggishly, and the stench in summertime was notorious. It was not until 1906 that the main drain system commenced to deposit city sewage out beyond the harbour.

Perhaps Stephen's hydrophobia is more comprehensible when we recall that on bad days, "the bathing as far out as Sandymount was often destroyed" . The Liffey, memorialized in Sir Samuel Ferguson's poem "Mesgedra" as "limpid Liffey, fresh from wood and wold," bore the carcasses of dogs and cats along the river; Stephen encounters one such carcass on the beach. Bloom refers to the river as "that sewage" (Joyce 125); Stephen thinks of "unwholesome sandflats . . . breathing sewage breath" (Joyce 34). The Dublin Main Drainage Works, long anticipated, were finally inaugurated September 24, 1906. In Davy Byrne's pub, Nosey Flynn asks Tom Rochford, "How's the main drainage?" (Joyce 146). He burps in answer, conflating the city's systems of circulation and waste disposal with his own. Gifford writes that the real Tom Rochford, an engineer, "was, on 6 May 1905, involved in an attempt to rescue a sanitation worker overcome by sewage gas" . Two of the twelve men down the sewer died of the effects of the gas.
</p>

<p>
As O'Brien points out, worse than the stink of the Liffey were the hidden systems of house drains and sewage lines incapable of supporting the detritus of the new water

closets. A campaign to abolish privies was largely successful by 1907; in 1904, Bloom still enjoys his "jakes," accompanying himself with reading material that doubles as toilet paper. <i>Ulysses</i> engages in this very timely debate about waterclosets. When he reaches the urinal under the statue of Tommy Moore&#x02014;an initiative of the men of Dublin and not of the Dublin Corporation&#x02014;Bloom thinks, "Ought to be places for women" (Joyce 133). O'Brien writes that "the Corporation steadfastly refused to provide a public lavatory for the women of Dublin"  until long after June 16, 1904. In the offices of the Freeman's Journal and Evening Telegraph, Professor MacHugh juxtaposes the Hebraic civilization with the Roman:</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
What was their civilization? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers . . . The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: <i>It is meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset</i>.

MacHugh juxtaposes colonial Rome with colonial England and aligns them in their mutual obsession with toilets. To this, Lenehan wittily replies, "our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial to the running stream" (Joyce 108). Attitudes like Lenehan's were the despair of public health workers as well as colonial administrators; back in 1870, the Freeman's Journal pleaded, "Must the Liffey become the <i>cloaca maxima </i>of our city?"(O'Brien 18).
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that the hygienic Hebrew Bloom, owner of an indoor tap and running water, does not seem to have yet converted to a water closet, though the villa he imagines in Flowerville has a watercloset complete with footstool and armrests. In the city, waterclosets were a poisoned gift; as O'Brien writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Defective drainage caused the greatest harm among the better off classes, for their houses were rapidly converted to the water-carriage system of waste removal (Via WC's) while the poorer classes still generally depended on the old conservancy system of ashpit and privy.

The stinking "Irish Styx" did not pose the greatest threat to public health. Instead, the sewage gas that leaked from house drains and connecting lines stealthily contaminated both air and water.
</p>

<p>
What else is disagreeable about water closets? Perhaps Joyce objects to the way that they both express and mask a faecal obsession. <i>Ulysses </i>is a book that celebrates waste; water closets whisk away the offending excreta, allow us to deny the reality of our own shit. Clearly this would have been tempting as a metaphor for colonial denial of the waste products of imperial history. By contrast, Bloom's visit to the privy prompts him to meditate on the fertilizing qualities of manure. For Bloom, nothing is pure waste. Meanwhile, the hidden pipes of the new "sanitary water closets" of Dublin contributed to Dublin's staggering rates of mortality and disease.
</p>

<p>
Behind the simple action of turning on a tap or visiting a privy in <i>Ulysses </i>is a deeply historical&#x02014;we might even say an environmental&#x02014;logic. There is an uncanny, nearly prescient intuition of issues of scarcity and waste, of disposal and supply&#x02014;issues that have only become more important in the hundred years since the book was set. Nothing comes from nothing, and nothing returns to nothing; Joyce rejects the promises of Old Testament and New, preferring to situate his book in a world scatological rather than eschatological, a world of history and of waste&#x02014;in Joyce's terms, indeed, these may be much the same substance.
</p>

<p>
Yet despite this insistence on historicity, it is important to keep in mind that this remains a fictional text. Like Wittgenstein's picture of the boiling pot, (must there be pictured water in the pictured pot, he asks), the book creates the illusion of a real, lived Dublin while subtly differing from that Dublin.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  We achieve the illusion, but not the substance of depth and of the real&#x02014;an important corrective to any strictly historical reading of Joyce.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Wallace Stevens references this quality of realism when he writes of a house in a poem that "the windows will be lighted, not the rooms"&#x02014;a near perfect evocation of the stage set of realism, where certain details are evoked in such depth that they create the illusion of a real, filled-out world around them. Indeed, 

<b></b>

in the "Ithaca" chapter of <i>Ulysses</i>, Joyce seems to reference not realism so much as naturalism, the compendious, encyclopaedic works of Zola and Hardy that participate in the near-obsessive attempt to catalogue the world.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  These literary counterparts to the late nineteenth-century obsession with charting and measuring, hierarchizing, and defining seem to both know and not know that they are engaged in a task of Sisyphean impossibility.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  As Fritz Senn writes of the "bias of the organizing mind toward categorization . . . It gets everything under control. And misses almost everything" .<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Even as the tour of the water supply of Dublin points us to a certain historical depth in Joyce's novel, a consciousness of origin and source, the passage also playfully and paradoxically points to the routes we will not trace, the facts that can not be charted, the truths we can not know. Perhaps when Joyce quipped that the reader would be able to recreate Dublin from his text, he meant a city as any single individual might know it, with certain streets known nearly by heart and other entire neighbourhoods left in the realm of rumour and possibility. Joyce understands that the novel will never succeed in charting the world in full, but neither will we; the novel knows the world as we ourselves do, in luminous islands of insight or recognition suspended in a dark sea of obscurity.

As Paul Gilmore writes, "in the past two decades, American literary criticism has tended to dismiss aesthetics in toto by identifying it almost exclusively with New Criticism's formal judgements". Gilmore claims, "while aesthetics on its own does not create a more just or egalitarian world, any progressive politics shorn of the utopian and sensual experience the aesthetic attempts to capture is bound to be as empty and detached from material lives as the idealist, formalist aesthetic of the New Critics". Gilmore argues that the exploration of historically specific ideas about aesthetics and the practices they engendered may lead to a fuller and less universalizing treatment of the category of the aesthetic.

As Ian Hunter succinctly puts it, "The cultural studies movement conceives of itself as a critique of aesthetics . . . The slogan of this project is the proposal to "politicize aesthetics" . This project has been deeply influenced by Pierre Bourdieu's claim that "the pure aesthetic is rooted in an ethic, or rather, an ethos of elective distance from the necessities of the natural and social world, which may take the form of moral agnosticism (visible when ethical transgression becomes an artistic <i>parti pris</i>) or of an aestheticism which presents the aesthetic disposition as a universally valid principle and takes the bourgeois denial of the social world to its limit" . On the other side is the Jeremiah of aestheticism, Harold Bloom, who has long lamented the incursion of cultural studies into the literary field, and surprisingly, Richard Rorty, who writes, "You cannot, for example, find inspirational value in a text at the same time that you are viewing it as the product of a mechanism of cultural production" .

Stephen's discourse in the library is a marvellous display of criticism that attempts to bridge historic fact and textual fiction in a dazzling bricolage whose validity is as primarily a function of Stephen's creativity and rhetorical power. His listeners evoke different critical traditions and interpretive strategies, contrasting interest in the artist's life and context with ahistorical appreciation of the text. As Russell dismissively sniffs, "But this prying into the family life of a great man . . . Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays . . . We have KING LEAR: and it is immortal."

A number of critics have recently returned to the problems of aesthetics and have attempted to rewrite the terms of the debate between aesthetics and cultural studies. Among these writers are Isobel Armstrong, Ian Hunter, and Paul Gilmore. A recent issue of <i>American literature</i> was devoted to the topic of "Aesthetics and the End(s) of Cultural Studies" (September 2004) while a 1998 article by Scott Heller in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education </i>drew attention to recent work on aesthetics 

<b></b>

("Wearying of Cultural Studies, Some Scholars Turn to Beauty," December 4, 1998). Armstrong is hopeful about the possibilities of the aesthetic, claiming her project is one of "uncoupling the aesthetic and privilege" and writing that "the components of the aesthetic life are those that are already embedded in the processes and practices of consciousness&#x02014;playing and dreaming, thinking and feeling" rather than simply symptoms of bourgeois consciousness. Hunter is more sceptical; he sees the aesthetic approach as a rarefied practice, "an ethic: an autonomous set of techniques and practices by which individuals continually problematize their experience and conduct themselves as the subjects of an aesthetic existence" and suggests that the dominance of the aesthetic stance has subsumed other, more effective forms of political engagement.

For discussions of water and flow in <i>Ulysses</i> see Robert Adams Day, "Joyce's AquaCities" in <i>Joyce in the Hibernian Metropolis</i> (3&#x02013;20). Robert Young elaborates on the secretions of language and music in "The Language of Flow", tracing "sex, secreting, farting, and writing" as the "concealed, illicit activities" of the text . In " 'Goddinpotty': James Joyce and the Language of Excrement," Vincent J. Cheng claims that in Joyce "not only is the body the site equally of the sacred and profane (the Body of God and the excreting body), but the two seem indistinguishable". Maud Ellman charts an "economy of flows" in <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> "where the wake of language&#x02014;writing&#x02014;is stained by urine, the wake of the flesh" . In <i>Ulysses</i>, urine is given its own "fourworded wavespeech." Susan Brienza also elaborates on "Joyce's specific conflation of fluids and verbal production"  which she, too, traces back to the <i>Portrait.</i> The most extensive exploration of what she calls the "alimentary logic" of the novel is by Lindsey Tucker in<i> Stephen and Bloom at Life's Feast: Alimentary Symbolism and the Creative Process in James Joyce's "Ulysses"</i> (Columbus: Ohio State UP1984). This essay differs from the work above because my interest is less in the metaphoric connection between water, waste, and creativity and more in the way the inflows and outflows of the text connect <i>Ulysses</i> to the historical realities and concerns of contemporary Dublin. In other words, while the focus of much of the work on Joyce here listed is textual my focus is cultural and historical and I argue that the emphasis on water and waste not only points in to the strategies and style of the text but also out to the world it claims to represent.

Jameson calls this passage, "boring in three sense of the word:  it is essentially non-narrative;  it is inauthentic, in the sense in which these mass-produced material instruments (unlike Homer's spears and shields) cannot be said to be organic parts of their users destinies; finally,  these objects are contingent and meaningless in their instrumental form, they are recuperable for literature only at the price of being transformed into symbols" . Yet "Ithaca"'s lists have asserted a strange and enduring fascination over Joyce's readers. Joyce himself called the chapter the "ugly duckling" of the book and therefore, his favorite (Ellman, 500). Part of the fascination of the chapter lies in the voyeuristic appeal of the list of objects in Bloom's drawers, or of his daily accounting, and part of it lies in the unexpected flights into whimsy or imagination which punctuate the more prosaic moments of the chapter. As Andrew Gibson writes, the chapter oscillates between "a founding and unfounding of worlds, between familiarity and defamiliarization, the sense of belonging and disorientation" .

Of course, as Brienza and others demonstrate, writing is also a form of bodily production in Joyce's work.

In the wake of Walter Benjamin's critical writings, it has become common to point to the Paris of the mid nineteenth century as the historical matrix of modernity. According to this conception, it was Paris that first gave rise to a radically new kind of sensibility and urban experience that was to find its characteristic expression in modernist art and literature.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Despite frequent references to this phenomenon, however, it has proven to be difficult to conceptualize and almost impossible to reconcile with contemporary social or aesthetic theories.  Occasionally juxtaposed to the abstract philosophic inheritance of the Enlightenment, the modernity of the urban experience has remained an amorphous and anomalous category, which can only be envisioned as the "other" of more familiar social and political conceptualizations of the modern. It represented, as Scott Lash and Jonathan Friedman put it, <i>another</i> modernity, "not of Rousseau's Geneva of natural rights and <i>volont&#x000E9; g&#x000E9;n&#x000E9;rale, </i>but instead of Baudelaire's Paris of the fleeting, the transient."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
How can we capture this important yet elusive cultural phenomenon? Is there a body of literary or philosophic theory that can provide a positive, rather than a merely negative, depiction of its characteristic gestures and goals? Despite superficial resemblances, Benjamin's vision of modernity was not synonymous with what Lionel Trilling had labeled the adversary culture. It rejected, in other words, the familiar dualism of both modernist and romantic theorists, who postulated a diametrical opposition 

<b></b>

between an interiorized realm of wholeness and integrity, on the one hand; and the external world of institutions and production, on the other. The modernity toward which Benjamin gestured was a single field of fluid perception and experience, rather than the repository of non-utilitarian values and perceptions marginalized by conventional society. It was the site of radical freedom and indeterminacy, where art and thought no longer reflected the pre-existent harmony of the universe, but helped create the preconditions for morality, beauty and intelligibility.  Above all, it was a radical and transgressive realm, which posed a powerful challenge to all stable or foundational categories associated with social and political modernity.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental incompatibility between the two modernities was already apparent to Baudelaire in the middle of the nineteenth century. In his Salon of 1859, he strikingly characterized it as a mortal combat between two ambitious men, "who hate one another with an intrinsic hatred, and when they meet upon the same road, one of them has to give way."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Although Baudelaire referred to this allegorical battle as the conflict between Poetry and Progress, the stakes were much higher than aesthetics. Indeed, one of my main arguments in this essay will be the need to liberate the concept of modernity from its vague associations with aestheticism and to reconnect it with the philosophic tradition of existentialism, phenomenology, and, ultimately, of everyday life. This task will involve a certain degree of defamiliarization and a shift away from an exclusive association of modernity with the cultural landscape of nineteenth-century Paris. I hope to show that Baudelaire's cultural vision, which first suggested this association, was the prototype of a more abstract theoretical and philosophic discourse about the novel and popular culture that was carried out in the twentieth century by critical thinkers such as the young Georg Luk&#x000E1;cs, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Ren&#x000E9; Girard and others.

Undoubtedly, modernity as a cultural idea found its earliest, and still paradigmatic, definition in Baudelaire's much-quoted essay of 1860, "The Painter of Modern Life" and it still provides a useful entry into our discussion. "By 'modernity'," Baudelaire famously wrote, "I mean the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Baudelaire's use of quotation marks around the concept of modernity signals the provisional and uncertain status of this idea for his time. Significantly, it was not synonymous with the familiar notion of modern times (<i>les temps modernes), </i>which had been in circulation since the seventeenth century and referred to a historical period that followed the Middle Ages.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Modernity as used by Baudelaire implied not so much a specific historical time, as an unprecedented experience of change and disruption that was characterized by the loss of stable external references for individual perception.
</p>

<p>
It is important to emphasize that Baudelaire's vision of the modern was not unique to his own avant-garde project.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  It was based on popular literary and cultural discourses of the 1840s, which linked the novel experiences of the age with the rise of the city 

<b></b>

and the erosion of transparency in contemporary life. Novelists such as Eug&#x000E8;ne Sue, Victor Hugo, and Alexander Dumas gave popular expression to this idea in their urban fictions, which depicted the city of Paris as a maze or labyrinth that could no longer provide coherent patterns or a logical design for the observer. Life seemed to have become illegible under modern conditions, which no longer provided the markers of public identity still available in traditional society. As Balzac tellingly put it, under the old regime, "one could tell who people were from their outward appearance and demeanor, even from their clothes." Contemporary life, by contrast, seemed to have produced a world of "infinite nuances," where identity was no longer publicly available.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The concept of modernity was, thus, inextricably intertwined with a crisis of representation or visuality, which affected all thoughtful observers, but was of most immediate concern to artists and writers charged with depicting the contours and distinct characteristics of modern life. The question at the heart of Baudelaire's project was how to imagine, conceptualize, and represent a world that had lost the legibility of traditional social orders. Were transparence and coherence possible in contemporary civilization and if not, how could it, nevertheless, be represented as a coherent whole? Significantly, these questions involved more than an aesthetic problem. They also encompassed ontological and epistemological questions that had traditionally been the concern of social theorists and philosophers, rather than artists.
</p>

<p>
Baudelaire explored the wide-ranging implications of this cultural crisis through the formulaic re of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> res [<a href="#1">1</a> &amp; <a href="#2">2</a>]. The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> has frequently been presented in later commentaries as an idle stroller or as the passive consumer of the urban spectacle. But, as Baudelaire's text makes clear, he was also a meticulous observer and recorder of experience in the city.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Indeed, his devotion to "the sketch of manners, the depiction of bourgeois life and the pageant of fashion"<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  made him the prototype of the modern novelist who focused on the everyday, as opposed to the elevated, facets of life. In his different guises as popular journalist, urban reporter, caricaturist, and story teller, he transformed the fleeting and trivial impressions of the urban scene into images and narratives that expressed the essential qualities of modernity. The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> was, as Baudelaire insisted, the true hero of modern life, because he had the ability to make visible and legible the elusive landscape of modernity that had become invisible and illegible under ordinary conditions.
</p>

<p>
By linking the question of modernity with the production of urban texts, Baudelaire suggested for the first time that modernity was inconceivable without its representations and that modern culture was not a reflection of reality, but rather, a creative force in its own right that played a central role in mediating between experience and society. Significantly, these ideas did not find broad-based support at the time of their writing, nor did they have any serious resonance immediately after Baudelaire's death in 1867. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, doubts about the possibility of representing the modern were resolved through the aesthetic codes of Realism, which subordinated art and perception to the stable and objective formulae of the natural sciences. It was not until the first half of the twentieth century, with the crisis of Realism, that Baudelaire's complex meditations about modernity as a cultural problem 

<b></b>

became relevant again. They were taken up by a group of philosophically oriented literary theorists such as Georg Luk&#x000E1;cs, Jos&#x000E9; Ortega y Gasset, Mikhail Bakhtin, Ren&#x000E9; Girard, Lucien Goldmann, Milan Kundera and others, whose theoretical inquiries into the cultural problems of the novel continued and deepened Baudelaire's earlier observations on modernity. In their hands, the related problems of urban modernity and representation were to be reformulated as the condition of possibility behind the creation of the world of the novel. </p>

<p>
The affinities between Baudelaire's urban vision and twentieth-century theories of the novel are not immediately obvious and have rarely been commented on, much less analyzed. One of the reasons for this neglect may lie in the fragmentation of critical discourses about modernity in the late nineteenth century and the shift of the center of gravity of such discussions from Paris to Central Europe. It was to be in the context of German neo-Kantian philosophy, exemplified by thinkers such as Georg Simmel and Wilhelm Dilthey, that the cultural implications of modernity and the nineteenth-century city were to be further developed and theorized. It is to this tradition that theorists of the novel would turn to ground their own vision of twentieth-century modernity. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Dilthey, in particular, was instrumental in drawing attention to the practices of urban novelists such as Dickens and Balzac as a possible source of a new theory of aesthetic modernity. In a seminal essay of 1887, he pointed out that there had developed a growing disjunction between speculative aesthetics inherited from the eighteenth century and contemporary artistic sensibilities as experienced by ordinary people. "Our German aesthetics does indeed still survive in some universities," Dilthey wrote, "but no longer in the consciousness of the leading artists and critics where it should live above all&#x02026;Since the French Revolution a new poetry current in London and Paris has attracted the interest of poets and public alike. As soon as Dickens and Balzac began to write the epic of modern life as found in the cities, the basic poetic principles debated by Schiller, Goethe, and Humboldt in idyllic Weimar became irrelevant."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Dilthey did not work out the full implications of these ideas and perhaps for this reason his essay never gained the widespread recognition it deserves. His theoretical agenda calling for a rediscovery of the nineteenth-century novel was to be continued, however, by his disciple, Georg Luk&#x000E1;cs, whose lifelong engagement with the philosophic problems of the novel can be traced back directly to Dilthey. As Luk&#x000E1;cs later admitted, his early masterpiece <i>The Theory of the Novel</i>  was conceived in the intellectual orbit of Dilthey and other neo-Kantian thinkers and was regarded in the 1920s as "a typical product of the tendencies of that school" as well as "the movement's most important publication."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  In fact, Luk&#x000E1;cs' essay on the novel was a further development of Dilthey's 1887 article, which, according to his own confession, opened up new grounds for his thinking about aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Theory of the Novel</i> was a prolonged meditation on the experiential world of the novel, written from the perspective of a modern sensibility no longer anchored within the foundational truths of art, science, or religion. The essay's powerful depiction of a destabilized and fragmented modernity gave voice to a cultural landscape that Baudelaire had already mapped out in the middle of the nineteenth century. Significantly, however, Luk&#x000E1;cs' reconceptualization no longer associated this state specifically with Paris, or even with a clearly defined chronological period. Detached from any particular geographic space or historical time, the world of the novel became a timeless archetype of the modern condition as it existed in the disembodied the consciousness of the individual.
</p>

<p>
In later life, the Marxist Luk&#x000E1;cs distanced himself from this essay, considering it an ideological deviation from the true path of socialism. <i>The Theory of the Novel</i>, Luk&#x000E1;cs explained, juxtaposed a radicalized, critical consciousness with a conservative acceptance of the everyday realities of capitalism, thus presenting a paradoxical "fusion of 'left' ethics and 'right' epistemology."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Whatever one might think of the political critique, the assessment itself was valid and went to the heart of the cultural experience captured in the essay. For the universe of the novel as interpreted by the young Luk&#x000E1;cs was indeed counter-political and difficult to define in traditional ideological terms. Like Baudelaire's complex assessment of modernity, it also gave voice to an intensely critical attitude toward modernity along with an equally intense immersion in, and preoccupation with, its experiential realities. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
What gives extraordinary interest to this perspective is the fact that it was prototypical of a more general inquiry into the phenomenology of the novel that emerged independently of Luk&#x000E1;cs' essay and was to constitute a submerged literary-philosophic tradition of its own in the twentieth century. In the summer of 1914, almost at the same moment when Luk&#x000E1;cs conceived his essay, the Spanish philosopher Jos&#x000E9; Ortega y Gasset published his own version of the historical meaning of the novel, with the suggestive title, <i>Meditations on Quixote</i>. More important and more lasting were the critical writings of the Russian literary scholar, Mikhail Bakhtin, who remained preoccupied with the historical and theoretical implications of the novel throughout the 1920s and '30s. In the 1960s, there was a resurgence of interest in the philosophy of the novel with the publication of Lucien Goldmann's <i>Toward the Sociology of the Novel</i> and Ren&#x000E9; Girard's <i>Deceit, Desire, and the Novel</i>. Goldmann was directly indebted to Luk&#x000E1;cs, while Girard, as he later confessed to Goldmann, had not read Luk&#x000E1;cs but unconsciously "discovered the Luk&#x000E1;csian analyses, while modifying them on several important points."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In the 1980s, writers such Milan Kundera and Franco Moretti returned once again to the genre of philosophic speculation about the novel, exploring its implications for late twentieth century culture in <i>The Art of the Novel</i> and <i>Modern Epic</i> respectively.
</p>

<p>
Michael McKeon has categorized these dispersed critical works as "grand theories" in order to distinguish them from more focused literary studies of the novelistic genre.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Though a sharp line of demarcation between the two traditions is not always easy to draw, the general distinction is, nevertheless, an important one. Unlike literary scholars such as Ian Watt, George Levine, Joseph Frank, or Michael McKeon himself, theorists of the novel loosely associated with the young Luk&#x000E1;cs were only peripherally interested in the formal or generic qualities of the novel.  Transcending the disciplinary boundaries of literary criticism, their real focus was the cultural-philosophic phenomenon of modernity, as it found expression through novelistic representation. Nancy Glazer's characterization of Bakhtin's work on the novel is applicable to the entire tradition that is under discussion here. "Viewed in conjunction," she wrote, "Bakhtin's discussion of Rabelais and Dostoevsky amount to neither an empirical account of the novel's history and form, nor a manifesto about what the novel should become. Rather, Bakhtin uncovers the ideological range of the novel genre we have inherited as a function of its past, and its history might best be understood as the accumulation of a repertory rather than as a linear development."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The theorists of the novel themselves confirmed this interpretation, repeatedly stressing the need to see the novel not merely as a literary genre but also as a microcosm of modernity. There existed, Lucien Goldmann wrote, a homology between "the structure of the classic novel and the structure of exchange in the liberal economy."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The novel was, Luk&#x000E1;cs echoed, "the representative art-form of our age: because the structural categories of the novel constitutively coincide with the world as it is today."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The lack of canonicity or formal qualities characteristic of the novel, Bakhtin further elaborated, was directly related to the dynamic, unfinished character of the social experience that it reflected. Indeed, the novel was   

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
the only developing genre and therefore it reflects more deeply, more essentially, more sensitively and rapidly, reality itself in the process of unfolding. Only that which is itself developing can comprehend development as a process. The novel has become the leading hero in the drama of literary development in our time precisely because it best of all reflects the tendencies of a new world still in the making; it is, after all, the only genre born of this new world and in total affinity with it.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite the frequency of such claims, theorists of the novel have rarely been read as philosophers or theorists of modernity. There are at least two reasons for this surprising fact. The first has to do with the marked reluctance of these thinkers to extricate the cultural or philosophic implications of their analysis from its literary manifestations. They acted on the implicit assumption that modernity was inseparable from its textual representations and could not be discussed in the abstract. The second and perhaps more important reason for the absence of theorists of the novel from general discussions of modernity has to do with the heterogeneity of the group. They never constituted a unified philosophic or literary movement, whose arguments could readily be summarized in terms of a common ideology or theoretical position. Indeed, they manifested a wide range of often contradictory attitudes toward the meanings and implications of the modern experience as reflected in the novel.
</p>

<p>
Ortega celebrated this world, regarding it as the expression of heterogeneity and a means of liberation from the "monotonous conformity of the epic."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Bakhtin, too, had an essentially positive view of the novel, which, according to him, challenged political patriarchy, ossified literary forms, and the "unfreedom of the subject."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  For Luk&#x000E1;cs, on the other hand, the universe of the novel signified an essentially tragic condition marked by the "transcendental homelessness" of the modern self, who had lost the possibility of experiencing totality, meaning, and redemption. It was, as he strikingly put it "the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Girard's vision of the novelistic universe was equally anguished, though for somewhat different reasons. In his case the source of critique was not the absence of totality but of spiritual transcendence in the modern world where desire, envy, and <i>ressentiment</i> were always inevitably intertwined.
</p>

<p>
Despite such sharply differentiated opinions about the implications of modernity, theorists of the novel nevertheless conceived the cultural topography of the novel in roughly similar terms. Moreover, they used almost identical categories to depict its contours. Just as Baudelaire had juxtaposed the flux and contingency of modernity to the realm of the eternal and the immutable, so theorists of the novel conceptualized the phenomenology of the modern in terms as an unceasing opposition between the world of the novel and the epic. These were, as we have already noted, not simply different literary genres but different orders of experience that were radically incommensurate with each other. The epic did not constitute the historical antecedent of the novel, but rather its absolute other, whose existential realities could not even be imagined by the modern self. As Luk&#x000E1;cs put it, the world of the epic had become uninhabitable to the modern mind, which had outgrown the finitude of a closed universe.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Bakhtin repeated the same perception when he claimed that the epic "stands on an utterly different and inaccessible time-and-value plane" from the modern novel.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  There was, Ortega 

<b></b>

elaborated on the same idea, an absolute gap between the mythical world of the epic and the real world of the novel. "No matter how many real yesterdays we interrogate, the sphere inhabited by the Achilleses and the Agamemnons has no relationship with our existence and we cannot reach it, step by step, by retracing the path opened up by the march of time. The epic is not our past."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The emphatic rejection of all conceptual or chronological continuities between the novel and the epic had more radical consequences than may be apparent at first sight. It went far beyond the familiar notions of discontinuity or even cataclysmic disruption, which have become staples of critical discourses about the modern world. The radical incommensurability between the world of the epic and the novel ultimately negated the very idea of history itself, which could no longer be conceived as teleological process, cultural regression, or linear evolution. The world of the novel, its theorists insisted, gave rise to a new consciousness of time that was experienced for the first time as ceaseless movement and becoming, rather than as divinely orchestrated pattern or as rationally organized progress. For the modern mind, Bakhtin explained, "the present is something transitory, it is flow, it is eternal continuation without end; it is denied an authentic conclusiveness and consequently lacks essence as well."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Detached from all chronological or conceptual relations to the past or the future, the world of the novel was a timeless condition that could emerge unexpectedly at different historical moments. It is for this reason that Bakhtin could claim that novelistic periods "occurred several times in the Hellenic period, again in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but with special force and clarity beginning in the second half of the eighteenth century."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
What were the characteristic features of this novelistic universe that was beyond the conceptual categories of history? More specifically still, what were the continuities and divergences between this decontextualized world and Baudelaire's own vision of urban modernity? In considering these questions, I will focus on the formulations of Luk&#x000E1;cs, Bakhtin, and Girard, possibly the most nuanced theoretician of the novel, whose ideas complemented each other to a remarkable extent. Their meditations about the novel lead them through a heterogeneous intellectual terrain that ranged, in apparent disregard of disciplinary boundaries, through cultural criticism, epistemology, aesthetics, literary theory, and sociology. These issues, however, were invariably framed by a common set of concerns whose source can clearly be traced back to visions of the nineteenth-century city as first interpreted by Baudelaire. They, too, were preoccupied by the crisis of representation and experience under modern conditions, whose pre-eminent symbol had been the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>. It is thus hardly surprising that this formulaic re of nineteenth-century modernity should find re-incarnation in their work as a new kind of hero associated with the world of the novel. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The demise of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> and his metamorphosis into the hero of the novel is a complicated story that cannot be fully recounted here. Susan Buck-Morss succinctly summarized it when she remarked that the original <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> who inhabited the Parisian arcades of the 1840s has been irretrievably lost to the twentieth century, having exploded into a "myriad of forms" which constitute only brilliant traces of its earlier existence.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Significantly, the process of diffusion and fragmentation was already well under way by the time Baudelaire adopted the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> as the quintessential symbol of the modern artist. The transformation of Paris into a rationalized and impersonal public space in the course of the 1850s and 1860s was gradually destroying the physical and cultural preconditions of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>. Haussmann's Paris erased not only the old neighborhoods that had been the characteristic haunts of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> but also the dense networks of urban sociability that had formed the social and cultural basis of his enterprise.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> could no longer hope to render this new city legible and comprehensible to its inhabitants and he gradually faded from the cultural scene of the late nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
Although the urban context almost completely disappeared from twentieth-century depictions of the novelistic hero, the family likeness with the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> remained in evidence and pointed to a common cultural enterprise. Like his nineteenth-century predecessor, the hero of the novel was also a cultural type, rather than a particular individual, who embodied the general characteristics of the modern condition. He, too, was a textual creation as well as a creator of texts, and thus constituted a symbolic bridge between the realms of social experience and aesthetic representation. Significantly, however, the world of social experience and aesthetic representation had become both more fragmented and more radical in the twentieth century and the hero of the novel invariably developed different strategies for representing them. While the nineteenth-century <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> had still been able to hold in precarious balance the different aspects of modernity, the hero of the novel could no longer aspire to such a broadly synthetic function. He assumed different features and characteristics in the respective theories of Luk&#x000E1;cs, Bakhtin, and Girard, whose amplifications of particular facets of nineteenth-century <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> provided new incarnations of modern identity and, more generally, of the modern condition. Curiously, these amplifications ultimately served to clarify and radicalize, rather than invalidate, the condensed vision of modernity provided in Baudelaire's paradigmatic <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>.
</p>

<p>
The continuities between the hero of the novel and the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> are, perhaps, most readily recognizable in Luk&#x000E1;cs' novelistic hero, whose transcendental homelessness reenacted the nineteenth-century <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>'s problematic, essentially promiscuous, relationship to the physical spaces of the modern city. Both res were estranged from the external world, where identity could no longer be defined through physical deeds or heroic adventure. The development of an "autonomous life of interiority," Luk&#x000E1;cs emphasized, was the inevitable consequence of the modern experience. Yet, alienation and interiorization were not absolute conditions for the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> and the novelistic hero. Both remained haunted by visions of totality associated with the epic and both defined their identities through the frame of epic possibilities. Describing the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> 

<b></b>

as an "out-of-work Hercules,"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Baudelaire only hinted obliquely at this lost horizon of modern identity. By contrast, Luk&#x000E1;cs fully explored it, defining the novelistic hero as the direct antithesis of the epic hero.
</p>

<p>
Luk&#x000E1;cs did not present the lost world of the epic as a utopia that provided security or an absence of suffering for its heroes. The defining feature of this lost world was, as Luk&#x000E1;cs put it, "the adequacy of the deeds to the soul's inner demand for greatness, for unfolding, for wholeness."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  The epic hero was at home in the world because of a fundamental homology between itself and the possibilities offered by external reality. There was no fundamental distinction between "inside" and "outside" in the epic universe since the self and the world were made of the same substance. "The world is wide and yet it is like home," Luk&#x000E1;cs illustrated, "for the fire that burns in the soul is of the same essential nature as the stars; the world and the self, the light and the fire, are sharply distinct, yet never become permanent strangers to one another."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  By contrast, the hero of the novel lived in a world "richer in gifts and dangers than the world of the Greeks," but the meaning of this world had become unknowable to him, because it was alien to his inner essence. The disappearance of overarching symbolic meanings rooted in the experience of totality had made the external world fundamentally unknowable to the modern mind.
</p>

<p>
It is important to stress that Luk&#x000E1;cs' juxtaposition of the world of the epic to that of the novel had nothing to do with nostalgia for an unattainable past. His was not a conservative repudiation of the decadence of modern life, but rather a radical critique of one particular version of modernity to which Baudelaire had already referred in 1859 as the idea of Progress. In Luk&#x000E1;cs' essay, however, Progress assumed a more specific, less allegorical, incarnation than in Baudelaire. It was represented by Kant's pivotal re and in particular by the epistemological assumptions of modern rationality as codified by Kant's critical philosophy. Significantly, Luk&#x000E1;cs' epistemological critique of rationality evoked the same images that Baudelaire and his contemporaries had used in their own depictions of the crisis of urban representation in the mid nineteenth-century city. For Luk&#x000E1;cs, too, the essential problem of rational epistemology was associated with the failure of vision and the decrease of transparency in everyday life. As he put it, the hero of the novel could no longer understand the external meaning of events, nor penetrate "Kant's starry firmament" since he had lost all inner relationship to the external world.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Knowledge became internalized, subjective, self-reflexive, and the knowing self no more than a groping wanderer in the night of pure cognition. For such a self, Luk&#x000E1;cs concluded, "no light radiates any longer from within into the world of events, into its vast complexity to which the soul is a stranger."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Luk&#x000E1;cs' perception that Kantian rationalism had become incompatible with modern experience was widely shared by theorists of the novel and formed, indeed, the defining category of their particular vision of modernity. Bakhtin's infinitely more optimistic interpretation of the world of the novel also repudiated autonomous reason as a basis for modern identity and knowledge. This is made all the more striking by the fact that his particular critique of modern rationality took an entirely different form than Luk&#x000E1;cs'. Bakhtin saw the novelistic hero, not as a tragic and disembodied consciousness adrift 

<b></b>

in an unknowable world; but rather as comic performer and a creator of masks and disguises rooted in face-to-face relations. These seemingly incompatible versions of the novelistic hero were actually mirror images of each other, representing different facets of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>. For as Baudelaire had made clear, the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> was not only an urban stroller and observer but also a theatrical performer who assumed masks and disguises&#x02014;that of the child, the primitive, the dandy, the courtesan, and the soldier&#x02014;in order to reenact the lost totality of epic culture in the midst of a fragmented modern civilization.
</p>

<p>
The aesthetic process shaping the creation of this kind of self was, Bakhtin suggests, similar to the construction of comic genres in antiquity. The masks of antiquity "had&#x02026;an enormous influence on the development of the novelistic image of man. This structure is preserved even in the novel, although in a more complex, deeply meaningful and serious (or serio-comical) form."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The affinity between the hero of the novel and the comic masks of antiquity and the middle ages was their parodic and transgressive relationship to the epic heroes of high genres, whom they brought down to everyday life. Bakhtin's unique vision of modern identity reversed Luk&#x000E1;cs' tragic categories, insisting that the masks of the novelistic hero represented not alienation and inauthenticity, but rather, "a happy surplus" and the inexhaustibility of human possibilities. "There is," Bakhtin elaborated, "no mere form that would be able to incarnate once and forever all of his human possibilities and needs, no form in which he could exhaust himself down to the last word, like the tragic epic hero&#x02026;.There always remains an unrealized surplus of humaneness; there always remains a need for the future, and a place for this future must be found. All existing clothes are always too tight, thus comical, on a man."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The contrast between the epic hero and the hero of the novel was inevitably favorable to the latter. While the epic self was trapped in one identity and defined by the force of an external fate, the hero of the modern self was free to define himself and to transcend his given circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Bakhtin's novelistic hero repudiated not only the closed world of the epic but also all "high genres," including critical philosophy. In place of formalized knowledge and official ideology, the modern self affirmed "the eternally living element of unofficial language and unofficial thought (holiday form, familiar speech, profanation)."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Knowledge in the world of the novel was everyday, realistic, based on the common world of ordinary people, and hostile to all existing hierarchies and established authority. It had, Bakhtin explained, "the remarkable power to make an object come up close, of drawing it into a zone of crude contact where one can finger it familiarly on all sides, turn it upside down, inside out, peer at it from above and below, break open its external shell, look into its center, doubt it, take it apart, dismember it, lay it bare and expose it, examine it freely and experiment with it."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The critique of philosophic rationalism, explicit in both Luk&#x000E1;cs and Bakhtin, was continued in the literary criticism of Ren&#x000E9; Girard, who conceptualized the hero of the novel as a desiring, rather than as a knowing or performing, self. A creature of will, imagination, and fantasy, Girard's novelistic hero embodied perhaps the least familiar facet of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>, that of consumption. Yet, the experience of consumption was an integral part of Baudelaire's vision of the modern city, whose sights and attractions were not only 

<b></b>

observed, but also consumed by the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>.  In the final analysis, Baudelaire's <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> was not only a fictional character within novels nor an actual producer of novels; he was also an avid consumer of novels. The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> as consumer was neither a tragic nor a transgressive re but a nostalgic one who refused to relinquish the world of epic adventure and attempted to recreate its possibilities through imagination and imitation. For Girard, the prototype of this type of self was Don Quixote, who was also the first example of the novelistic hero. Anticipating later incarnation of the type such as Mme Bovary, Don Quixote was a passionate reader of contemporary romances and set himself the task of duplicating the world of chivalric ideals exemplified by the fictional hero Amadis.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Don Quixote, wrote Girard, "has surrendered to Amadis the individual's fundamental prerogative: he no longer chooses the objects of his own desire&#x02014;Amadis must choose for him. The disciple pursues objects which are determined for him, or at least seem to be determined for him, by the model of chivalry."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What was taken for knowledge in the modern world, Girard pointed out, was the imitative impulse and the desire to identify with an admired other. Significantly, desire was never direct between the desiring subject and the desired object, but triangular, involving a third, unacknowledged other, who mediated between the subject and the object. The triangular nature of desire could turn into hatred and <i>ressentiment</i> in modern conditions. While Don Quixote had still acknowledged the object of his emulation as superior to himself, in the world of the nineteenth-century novel, the imitative impulse could not be openly acknowledged since it was projected on to individuals who were essentially one's equals. Knowledge as the imitation of the desire of the other, Girard postulated, had nothing in common with the "objective and subjective fallacies" of traditional epistemology, which insisted on locating truth either in the inner or the outer worlds. Cognition based on desire was always socially embedded in the sense that it took place in the world between subjects rather than within them or outside them. What made this fact difficult to recognize was the ideology of originality, objectivity, and autonomy that had developed in the late eighteenth century. Modern theories of knowledge, whether associated with the Enlightenment or Romanticism, Girard summarized, "all defend the same illusion of autonomy to which modern man is passionately devoted."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
The remarkable convergences among these different conceptualizations of the novelistic hero are no coincidence. Whether conceived as Luk&#x000E1;cs' tragic observer, as Bakhtin's comic performer, or as Girard's imitative consumer, the novelistic hero represented different facets and incarnations of nineteenth-century <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>, transposed beyond the empirical spaces of the city. Yet, the exact nature of this common historical context still needs to be established. How can we characterize the symbolic world inhabited by the heroes of the novel? Their opposition to the abstract world of Kantian reason and their valorization of the experiential realm of everyday life point to affinities with the philosophic traditions of existentialism and phenomenology. It is significant 

<b></b>

that the Marxist Luk&#x000E1;cs used identical terms to characterize his own youthful essay on the novel and Sartre's philosophy of existentialism; he referred to both as examples of a mistaken ideology, combining "left" ethics and "right" epistemology.
</p>

<p>
Yet, the analysis of the world of the novel exclusively in terms of existentialism or phenomenology can go only so far and provides only partial insight into its realities. On closer examination, there were striking divergences between the two phenomena. Unlike existentialism, the novel was not analogous with a meaningless or atomized universe, inhabited by isolated individuals. On the contrary, it gave expression to a complex cultural system with a unity of its own that incorporated the fragmented elements of modern life within a new, paradoxical vision of totality. By the same token, the hero of the novel was not the isolated subject of existentialist philosophers but a culturally embedded self, whose very identity was defined by webs of social relations mediated through irony, parody, and desire. This was true of even Luk&#x000E1;cs' novelistic hero, whose cosmic pessimism had distinct resonances with existentialist themes. Luk&#x000E1;cs' exemplary modern self, however, was ultimately an affirmative re, who assumed the mantle of epic heroes in his attempts to make sense of the world in which he lived. His habitual state of mind was irony, not anguish. Like Baudelaire's Monsieur G., Luk&#x000E1;cs' hero was not a metaphysical outsider but a man of the world, whose maturity was based on hard-won sociological insights.
</p>

<p>
In the final analysis, it is the profoundly social aspects of the novelistic universe that projected it beyond the philosophic frames of existentialism. In order to understand the nature of this sociability, it will be useful to look a little more closely at the aesthetic dimensions of theories of the novel, which provided the preconditions for its distinctive vision of modernity. Contrary to the assumptions of na&#x000EF;ve realists, theorists of the novel did not hold that the world of everyday experience reflected in the novel could ever be represented directly or without mediation. As Luk&#x000E1;cs pointed out, everyday life was meaningless and ungraspable without aesthetic structuring. In his words, everyday modernity cannot achieve the
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
form of totality for itself as a whole, or any form of coherence for its own relationship to its elements and their relationship to one another: in other words, the outside world cannot be represented. Both the parts and the whole of such an outside world defy any forms of direct sensuous representation. They acquire life only when they can be related either to the life-experiencing interiority of the individual lost in their labyrinth, or to the observing and creative eye of the artist's subjectivity: when they become objects of mood and reflection.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The claim, however, that aesthetics lay at the heart of representing modern experience brought with it theoretical contradictions of which theorists of the novel were well aware. For even while asserting that the world of the novel could not exist without aesthetic structuring, they also paradoxically maintained that the novelistic form was incompatible with canonical aesthetics. The novel, they insisted, had shattered all inherited aesthetic forms and equally rejected the conventions of classicism and Romanticism. It differed from these traditions precisely because of its openness to the 

<b></b>

disruptive energies of everyday life and ordinary experiences.  It was a fundamentally heterogeneous genre that did not make strict distinctions between the fictional and the real, between art and life. "That is why," Luk&#x000E1;cs wrote, "from the artistic view point, the novel is the most hazardous genre, and why it has been described as only half an art by many who equate <i>having a problematic </i>with <i>being a problematic.</i>"<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  It was perhaps Bakhtin who made most explicit the connection between the novel and the transgressive energies of everyday culture. Novelization, he wrote, exploded aesthetic forms, incorporating extra-literary elements into language, and thus creating "a living contact with unfinished, still evolving contemporary reality."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>   Comic genres, of which the novel was a direct descendant, made no pretense of originality but openly challenged closed and elite literary forms. For this reason, they had the power to both transform the world and to see it realistically.
</p>

<p>
Although the novel's open-ended and heterogeneous structure represented the direct antithesis of classicism, its true adversary, as far as theorists of the novel were concerned, was not the epic but Romanticism, in which they saw the precursor of all forms of modern high art. Romanticism, they objected, attempted to artificially reaffirm the organic unity in the work of art in an age when such experiences were no longer available to the modern mind. Luk&#x000E1;cs presented perhaps the most passionate critique of Romanticism and the Kantian theory of aesthetic autonomy and disinterestedness. He argued that this kind of art was essentially escapist, substituting an illusion of wholeness for the fragmented realities of modern experience. The attempt to resurrect through art a totality that was no longer part of the genuine experience of the modern self was, he claimed, a demonic act of hubris, "a violence done to the essence of everything that lies outside the sphere of art." All theories of aesthetic autonomy were, he objected, deliberate attempts to "forget that art is only one sphere among many, and that the very disintegration and inadequacy of the world is a precondition of the existence of art and its becoming conscious."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  The true expression of a fragmented modernity, Luk&#x000E1;cs insisted, was not the illusory and escapist totality advocated by the Kantian aesthetic of autonomy but the willed heterodoxy of the modern novel that was the only form capable of creating the true epic of modern life.
</p>

<p>
The challenge of theorizing the novel as an art form lay precisely in explaining the paradox of its aesthetic unity in the midst of its heterodoxy. How did the novel remain open to the dynamic elements of modern life without disintegrating into its constituent parts or into autonomous, self-sufficient fields?  For theorists of the novel, the answer lay in the novel's paradoxical relationship to the epic, which continued to frame the novelistic universe as its condition of negative possibility. The epic possibilities inherent in the modern condition had preoccupied Baudelaire as well, who encouraged his contemporaries to discover the essential "heroism of modern life" in the diverse manifestations of urban popular culture. By the twentieth century, theorists of the novel articulated the same quest in a more ironic but equally urgent form. As Luk&#x000E1;cs tellingly put it, "the novel is the epic of an age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given, in which the immanence of life has become a problem, yet which still thinks in terms of totality."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The novelistic perspective was, thus, defined by an "intuitive double vision" that continued to see the modern world through the lost image of the epic. Ironic echoing, parody, and imitation had the paradoxical power to affirm the heterogeneity of the novelistic universe even while linking its dissonant parts in a provisional unity. The organicism implied in such a world, Luk&#x000E1;cs explained, was not "a true-born organic relationship but a conceptual one which is abolished again and again."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  The ironic point of view was based on the recognition "that meaning can never quite penetrate reality, but that, without meaning, reality would disintegrate into the nothingness of inessentiality."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>   It was ultimately the vision of a hard-won maturity that, to use Luk&#x000E1;cs' words again, "can see where God is to be found in a world abandoned by God" and can recognize "the lost utopian home of the idea that has become an ideal."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Whether perceived as tragedy or as comedy, the novel constituted a paradoxical unity that echoed, without duplicating, the totality of the epic.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible not to recognize in these aesthetic formulations the constitutive elements of a theory of popular culture, which posed its radical claims in opposition to the formal unity of high art. Such an identification is not surprising if we keep in mind that the novel was one of the pioneering forms of an explicitly commercialized popular culture, which came into existence in the course of the early nineteenth century in metropolitan centers such as Paris and London. As Marthe Robert usefully reminds us, the novel was "a newcomer to the literary scene, a commoner made good who will always stand out as something of an upstart, even a bit of a swindler, among the established genres it is supplanting."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The difficulty of recognizing the familiar features of popular commercial culture within the sophisticated formulations of theorists of the novel can in part be explained by the problematic, degraded status of commercialized culture within critical discourses about the modern. Since its first appearance in the Paris of the 1830s, the phenomenon has drawn the passionate criticism of middle-class intellectuals and social elites. In 1839, the critic Sainte-Beuve declared a moral crusade against what he called "La litt&#x000E9;rature industrielle" (The Industrial Literature), condemning it as a trivialized form of entertainment that threatened both artistic excellence and moral standards in the modern world.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Such criticism, which would be reiterated in many different forms and contexts, invariably resorted to an apocalyptic vocabulary of decadence and cultural decline and often posed its fears in terms of elite culture's distrust of popular democracy. The exaggeration of language and rhetoric was, however, based on an accurate intuition. Popular commercial culture did, indeed, prove to be incompatible with what Baudelaire had labeled in his Salon of 1859 the re of Progress. It questioned the absolute autonomy of the individual, the cognitive supremacy of reason, and the progressive nature of history. Unlike aesthetic modernism, which only strove to give voice to non-utilitarian values marginalized by modern society, popular mass culture destabilized the very bases of social and political modernity.
</p>

<p>
Theorists of the novel were, of course, profoundly aware of the inescapable ambivalence that the modernity of popular commercial culture provoked among many observers and often shared these ambivalences themselves. Luk&#x000E1;cs is perhaps the 

<b></b>

most interesting example of such a divided perspective. As is well known, in 1919 he entered the Communist Party of Hungary and repudiated his entire early career, which had been dedicated to the task of developing a comprehensive philosophy of cultural modernity.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  This dramatic gesture was not just a sudden impulse provoked by the crisis of war. His reservations about the destabilizing implications of modernity were voiced as early as 1911 in his respectful yet critical obituary of Wilhelm Dilthey. In this writing, Luk&#x000E1;cs accused Dilthey of failing to bring to its logical conclusion his battle against "the 'scientific world view' and the 'positivist' sociology." Dilthey's valorization of everyday life and unstructured experience held the danger, Luk&#x000E1;cs argued, of relativism and subjectivism, unless completed by a cultural renaissance leading to a new vision of totality.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  In 1918, he expressed the same reservations with neo-Kantianism in his obituary of Simmel, which was couched in almost identical terms as that of Dilthey. Simmel, too, appeared to Luk&#x000E1;cs as a "transitional philosopher" who helped repudiate ossified cultural forms but lacked the creative capacity and intellectual courage to complete the revolution he started. Simmel, like Dilthey, Luk&#x000E1;cs concluded, was among "the harbingers of a new classicism, which will represent the richness of life through comprehensive new forms that are based on stable and strict foundations."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Luk&#x000E1;cs' conviction that the world of the novel was inevitably to be followed by a new age of integration and totality was not generally shared by theorists of the novel. For Bakhtin and for most of the other theorists with whom I have dealt in this paper, the world of the novel presented new opportunities for individual self-expression and innovation that amply compensated for the closed cultures they replaced. For them, the novel, with its heterogeneous gestures and openness to change, was the essential expression of human freedom and self-determination. It was, above all, the quintessential form in which modern life recognized itself. In Bakhtin's words, "studying other genres is analogous to studying dead languages; studying the novel, on the other hand, is like studying languages that are not only alive, but still young."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

Bakhtin associated the phenomenon of "Bovaryism" with the familiarity of the novelistic universe that allows readers to enter its frame as if it were reality. "It follows," he illustrated, "that we might substitute for our own life an obsessive reading of novels, or dreams based on novelistic models . . . Bovaryism becomes possible, the real-life appearance of fashionable heroes taken from novels&#x02014;disillusioned, demonic and so forth." "Epic and Novel," 32&#x02013;33.

<p class="noIndent">
<i>Ulysses</i> is a book about two things, Dublin life on June 16, 1904, and life. It is the story of a day (arbitrary enough to be everyday) in which a man (perverse enough to be everyman) wanders through a city (indistinct enough to be every place.) On the one hand, there are streets, pubs, postcards, newspapers, and Bloom's wayward thoughts. And on the other hand, there is myth, death, nationalism, and the cosmos. If <i>Ulysses </i>deals with colonialism, it does so because Bloom has stepped into Barney Kiernan's pub; if capitalism, because he is trying to sell an ad or buy some soap. At every turn, there is a welter of particulars set beside an intimation of the universal.
</p>

<p>
The early reviewers were quick to recognize this duality in <i>Ulysses</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

. . . Mr. Leopold Bloom, ranges like Moby Dick throughout the watery globe, and communes with incommunicable things under the stars.

"Ulysses" is the <i>Odyssey</i> retold, episode by episode, as the story of a day's life in the streets, pubs, and brothels of Dublin, and is an attempt to give a complete account of the nature of man. It is apparently almost miraculously successful.

<i>Ulysses</i> is the meeting-place of the mundane and the transcendent. From the teapot to the universe, from the public baths to the incommunicable, from the brothel to the nature of man is but the smallest of steps. Every vulgar detail becomes a window on the monumental.
</p>

<p>
Notice, though, how strained the language is. All the reviewers are trying to say is that the book is at once universal and particular. But somehow they keep stumbling. Phrases like "trivial but tremendous," "inconsequential but significant," and "communes with incommunicable things" have no intellectual force; they are just oxymorons, yoking together things that do not seem to fit together.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  They tell us <i>that </i>the book is particular and universal without telling us <i>how</i> that might be. Or, more accurately, they tell us that the particular/universal relation in <i>Ulysses</i> is simply a paradox, a palpable truth with no sure intellectual ground, and one that can only seem, as the <i>New Witness</i> says, "apparently almost miraculous."
</p>

<p>
The thing about <i>Ulysses</i>, though, is that even its paradoxes are universal; in this case, the same paradox that underlies Joyce's novel grounds high modernism as a whole. <i>Ulysses</i> may lack a particular/universal logic, but it does have a particular/universal <i>alchemy</i>; and its alchemy is a vestige of that rich alchemy that lies at the heart of high modernism and which we might translate: dissolution explodes into transcendence. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, it works like this: if the particulars are properly bare, they will explode into the universal; if the details are sufficiently vulgar, then they will leap into the realm of myth. So long as the alchemy of high modernism holds, then Dublin can be everywhere, Joyce's realism can be mythical, his styles can constitute a style, and this daily Dublin day can be all of life.
</p>

<p>
Once the alchemy ceases to hold, however&#x02014;once high modernism fades and a new aesthetic emerges&#x02014;then <i>Ulysses</i> comes to look like a mere paradox again. <i>Ulysses</i>, we might say, has the kind of particular/universal logic that only a modernist can understand.

Why Dublin?
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
One way to begin would be to ask, why Dublin? Why this particular place as the locus of every place? Did <i>Ulysses</i> have to be set in Dublin or could it have been somewhere else?<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Would any city work? Any town or village? I could put the question another way: how much do you have to know about Dublin to understand <i>Ulysses</i>? If you read the book with New York in mind&#x02014;or Paris or Shanghai&#x02014;how much can you appreciate? Nothing? Or how about: none of the details but everything that matters? This would be one facet of the particular/universal problem&#x02014;the local and the global.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
There is a long tradition of critics who have wondered about the Dublinness of <i>Ulysses</i>. As early as 1922, the <i>Dublin Review</i> opined that "Nothing could be more ridiculous than the youthful dilettantes in Paris or London who profess knowledge and understanding of a work which is often mercifully obscure even to the Dublin-bred."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In recent years, this line has been continued by post-colonial Joyce critics, who tend to emphasize the representation of Irish colonial life.
</p>

<p>
There have been others, however, who dismiss Dublin and claim the book for broader pluralities&#x02014;sometimes humanity, sometimes Modernity. Pound, for one, wrote: "I doubt if the local allusions interfere with <i>general</i> comprehension," adding about Molly, "she exists presumably in Patagonia as she exists in Jersey City or Camden."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  This approach has been taken up most directly by Marxist critics like Franco Moretti and Terry Eagleton, the latter of whom once wrote:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The novel celebrates and undermines the Irish national formation at a stroke, deploying the full battery of cosmopolitan modernist techniques to re-create it while suggesting with its every breath just how easily it could have done the same for Bradford or the Bronx.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
There are two possibilities, then. Either all that is local melts into air, or it blocks the gates. Either Dublin defines the book or the book happens to pass through Dublin. And one way to discriminate between those possibilities would be to look at the function of Dublin within the novel. What does this city add to the thematics of Joyce's novel? What are the features that make Dublin fit for <i>Ulysses</i>? And do they allow Dublin to stand in for every place?
</p>

<p>
In 1800, Dublin was the second largest city in the British Isles (only London was larger). By 1850, it was only the fifth largest. And at the turn of the twentieth century, it was no longer even the largest city in Ireland (that distinction belonged to the more highly industrialized Belfast).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The Dublin of 1904 was a city in advanced decline. With the fifth highest death rate in the world and infant mortality higher than Moscow and Calcutta, it had lost its place among the advanced European capitals and earned its image as a municipal slum.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  So when Joyce says, "When you remember that Dublin has been a capital for thousands of years, that it is the 'second' city of the British Empire . . . it seems strange that no artist has given it to the world," he means at least two things: it is strange that no artist gave it to the world at a time when it seemed worth giving; and it is strange that he should be tasked with giving it to the world now, in its waning phase.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There is more to Joyce's Dublin than just its historical character, though&#x02014;more to it, in other words, than just this background of economic decline. There is also its fictional character. After all, Joyce's Dublin is not Dublin; it is a representation of Dublin. If Dublin can serve as the gateway to everywhere in <i>Ulysses</i>, then it is thanks, on the one hand, to certain characteristics of the historical city and, on the other hand, to certain characteristics of the fictional city. And so "why Dublin" has to mean both: "What made Dublin seem like the appropriate&#x02014;perhaps inevitable&#x02014;setting for <i>Ulysses</i>?" and also: "How did Joyce's fictionalization of Dublin contribute to 

<b></b>

that appropriateness?" To simplify, the two questions we have to answer are: "Why Dublin?" and "Why Joyce's Dublin?" The declining status of Dublin belongs with the first question. And if we leave it at that, then any declining city should work&#x02014;a Bronx <i>Ulysses</i> or a Camden. But there are features of Joyce's Dublin, in contrast, that make the Bronx seem a poor substitute.
</p>

<p>
For one thing, Joyce's city still has a village character&#x02014;whether or not that is true of the historical Dublin. The people you bump into are as likely to be intimates as strangers. And the streets tell a story about Irish history, albeit alongside the din of commodities. To call it a knowable community would be too strong, but it exhibits some characteristics for which the more common expressions about modern urban life&#x02014;shock, alienation, <i>Erlebnis</i>&#x02014;are simply inadequate. So much of Dublin is familiar (to its inhabitants at least): faces, locales, stories. Who, at the end of the day, hasn't heard about the postcard that reads U.P.: up? Or about the funeral of a single, rather undistinguished, man named Dignam? These things are still communal, as is the love of music, the penchant for gossip, and the burden of a failed revolutionary history (the cost of all this communal knowledge in <i>Ulysses</i>, incidentally, is the elision of large segments of Dublin life, from the slums on the one hand to the Anglo-Irish on the other.) Bloom may busy himself hatching entrepreneurial schemes and devising captivating advertisements, but his world is still full of pre-capitalist residues.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  To put it bluntly, when he shits he schemes, but he does not flush.
</p>

<p>
That may sound crass, but I think it is crucial to <i>Ulysses</i> and crucial to the question of how Dublin can be every place. The key here is the toilet&#x02014;in Bloom's case the absence of a toilet. Not all shit is created equal, or more precisely not all shit is excreted equal. Bloom, in particular, excretes in "the jakes," which is simply an outhouse with a bench and a hole.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  His jakes is musty, full of the "stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs," so much so that he has to remind himself not to dirty his nice trousers before the funeral. There's a "chink" in the wall through which he can see his neighbor's house&#x02014;though on this particular morning it happens that no one is there. He brings his newspaper and takes some pleasure in reading a vignette called "Matcham's Masterstroke," though decidedly less pleasure than he takes in the dynamics of release:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read on, seated above his own rising smell.

<p class="noIndent">
What is fun about this passage&#x02014;as so many others have noted&#x02014;is the confusion of defecation with reading; it is hard to say which is meant by the word "column," or whether "It did not move or touch him" refers to the story or his leavings. In any case, the thing to notice is just how sensuous the whole experience is for Bloom. He plays at restraining and yielding as if it were a courtship&#x02014;and then gushes at its success ("So. 

<b></b>

Ah!"). Bloom's counting house may be full of mouldy limewash, but that doesn't stop him from imagining himself in the role of the king.
</p>

<p>
After finishing the story and his business, Bloom wipes himself with the newspaper, picks up his pants and buttons them, before emerging "from the gloom into the air" . The one thing he doesn't do is flush. After all, a jakes is not a toilet, though that should have been obvious all along. Toilets belong to a different space altogether&#x02014;less cracked and wooden and more polished and industrial. In particular, they belonged at that technological fantasyscape convened at the Crystal Palace exhibition in 1851, which did in fact house the first public toilets.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Had he lived in London, Bloom would likely have ended his story with a flush, since, by 1904, the toilet had overrun the outhouse in much of England. So if famed nineteenth-century toilet engineer George Jennings is right, and "the civilization of a people can be measured by their domestic and sanitary appliances," then <i>Ulysses</i> says something damning about Irish civilization&#x02014;with its jakes and its open sewers.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But, then, Joyce did not think it was damning. Quite the opposite. He thought the obsessive industrialization of waste disposal the surest sign of cultural perversity. Hence Professor MacHugh's joke about the Romans:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: <i>It is meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah</i>. The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: <i>It is meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset</i>.

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
"Our old ancient ancestors . . . were partial to the running stream," is Lenehan's response. And if Bloom's and Stephen's simultaneous urinations are any guide, the new modern Dubliners still are.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Joyce was not the only artist treading this ground in the late War years. Duchamp's infamous <i>Fountain</i> (i.e. urinal) was first rejected in April 1917, about the time that Joyce began writing <i>Ulysses</i> in earnest.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  It, too, uses the toilet (or a near relation) as an index of artistic and technological madness, the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of one or the other, if not both. As Duchamp put it, in a way that MacHugh and Joyce would have understood perfectly, "The only works of art America has produced are her plumbing and her bridges."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
To my mind, though, the most incisive account comes from Ernst Bloch's 1918 <i>Spirit of Utopia</i>. Bloch uses the re of the machine to describe both the modern obsession with technology and the modern obsession with toilets:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It knew, the machine, how to make everything as lifeless and subhuman on a small scale as our newer urban developments are on a larger scale. Its real objective is the bathroom and the toilet, these most indisputable and original accomplishments of our time, just as Rococo furniture and Gothic cathedrals represent structures that define every other art object of their respective epochs. Now <i>lavatoriality</i> [Abwaschbarkeit] dominates; somehow, water runs from every wall, and even the most expensive products of our age's 

<b></b>

industrial diligence now partake of the wizardry of modern sanitation, the <i>a priori</i> of the finished industrial product.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The toilet, according to Bloch, is the telos of capitalism, the "real objective" of all technology. Everything moves towards the bathroom, with an inertia worthy of the name <i>lavatoriality</i>. It is a great word&#x02014;lavatoriality&#x02014;not only for this particular capitalist complex, but also for <i>Ulysses</i>.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  That is because, in <i>Ulysses</i>, it is not just waste that matters but also evacuation. Bloom sits on the jakes not in order to remind us that everyone does&#x02014;as in so much scatological literature&#x02014;but rather to remind us of a pre-technologized way of life <i>that is not just being repressed but actually effaced</i>. If the toilet prevails, people may never shit like Bloom again, and may never know the sensuousness that he finds amidst the jakes of Dublin. So while the toilet belongs to the sanitized world of London capital, the jakes belongs to the sensuous world of Joyce's Dublin.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
When toilets do appear in <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;and there are a few&#x02014;they have nothing to do with waste disposal. At one point Patrick Dignam, restored to life in a satiric s&#x000E9;ance, tells us that "he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as t&#x00101;l&#x00101;f&#x00101;&#x000F1;a, &#x00101;l&#x00101;v&#x00101;t&#x00101;r, h&#x00101;t&#x00101;k&#x00101;ld&#x00101;, w&#x00101;t&#x00101;kl&#x00101;s&#x00101;t" &#x02014;the joke, of course, being a confusion of the spiritual with the technological. The most these spirits can look forward to is electricity and indoor plumbing&#x02014;rather, than, say eternal bliss.
</p>

<p>
The more interesting example, however, comes from Molly and her memory of a visit to "Dr. Collins for womens diseases." As part of his diagnosis, Collins asks her about her stool, which prompts the following rumination:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not . . .
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->
(633&#x02013;4)
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Molly is reluctant to describe her stool to the doctor&#x02014;threatens, in fact, to give him a closer look than he really needs by way of a good smathering. Then, "by the way," she praises the toilet as a "nice invention." And finally, remembering how she used Milly's stool as a diagnostic aid, she acknowledges that "theres something in it"&#x02014;"it," I take it, being both the doctor's questioning and the stool itself. The toilet affords some privacy, but at a cost.
</p>

<p>
The toilet affords something else, though&#x02014;and this is what makes the passage so rich. It affords a new kind of pleasure; you just have to learn to misuse it. For her part, Molly likes to lower herself into the toilet and flush, to feel the prickly spray of the swirling water. There is something so charming about that idea; with a bit of irreverence 

<b></b>

the toilet becomes a secret pleasure-chamber, a private fountain for our most delicate parts. In any case, her fondness for the toilet clearly has nothing to do with sanitation or cleanliness or invisibility&#x02014;all those things which drive lavatoriality. Even when there are toilets in Dublin, they are still not used for flushing. Molly has found a way to strip the toilet of its technological aura and restore its materiality&#x02014;and its delights. As with Bloom's jakes, what matters for Molly is the sensuousness of it all; the pins and needles is to her what the game of restraint and release is for him. To borrow from Bloom, it is just so "Ah!," which, in a word, is why <i>Ulysses</i> is set in Dublin.
</p>

<p>
Joyce's Dublin is a place that still values pre-capitalist pleasures, and it is a place that still knows how to misuse capitalism for pleasure&#x02014;think of Molly's toilet, or Bloom wiping himself with a prize story, or Bloom and Gerty's reenactment of a dime novel. This is not a city driven by efficiency or enslaved to technology. Who, among Joyce's characters, lives to work? They live to drink, to sing, to gossip, to argue, to think, to scheme, and to flirt with sexual dalliance.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  When they do work, their work has a largely pre-industrial character: waiters waiting, apothecaries mixing, butchers chopping, newsboys hawking, milkmaids delivering, Stephen teaching, and of course, Bloom chasing down editors. Capitalism has not yet remade the city in its image, even if it has made inroads everywhere. There are still no factories, no department stores, and above all, no toilets.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Lavatoriality, that drive to claim the bathroom for capitalism, is nowhere to be found. The British, like the Romans, have their waterclosets, but the Dubliners in <i>Ulysses</i> prefer something more sensuous. Indeed, there is no more fit image for Joyce's Dublin than Bloom in the jakes. It captures both the vestigial nature of Dublin and the pleasure Dublin takes in being vestigial.
</p>

<p>
If Bloom is <i>l'homme moyen sensuel</i>, then Dublin is <i>la ville moyenne sensuelle</i>. And, like Bloom, it is really equal parts <i>sensuelle</i> and <i>moyenne</i>, a place of everyday pleasures but also of deep mundaneness. Dublin is a city whose lack of advancement befits it for mundane pleasures&#x02014;as opposed to the more rarified delights of "t&#x00101;l&#x00101;f&#x00101;&#x000F1;a, &#x00101;l&#x00101;v&#x00101;t&#x00101;r, h&#x00101;t&#x00101;k&#x00101;ld&#x00101;, w&#x00101;t&#x00101;kl&#x00101;s&#x00101;t." It is a city that revels in its backwardness and that opens itself to the pleasures of decline (and anti-lavatoriality). What we have, then, are two interlaced answers to our two interlaced questions. First: Why Dublin? Because it is a city whose protracted economic decline has made it susceptible to serving as Joyce's Dublin. Second: Why Joyce's Dublin? Because in Joyce's fictionalization, that decline reveals possibilities&#x02014;of immediacy, of sensuousness, of development, and perhaps of <i>being</i>&#x02014;that advancement forecloses. Dublin matters because it expresses the relation between decline and possibility, because it reveals the degree to which only coarseness can make us more sensuously, and more fully, human.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This is one way to resolve the particular with the universal, not by finding the most typical instance but the most germane. Here Dublin is less an image <i>of</i> the world than an image <i>for</i> the world. It is universal not because it looks like everywhere else&#x02014;after all, it has no toilets&#x02014;but because it makes not having toilets seem like a universal imperative. That fact that there is so much local detail does not prevent the book from taking on a universal character; local detail is what gives it that character. Not flushing away its waste&#x02014;reveling, instead, in the bare materiality of local life&#x02014;is what allows 

<b></b>

Dublin to become a repository for untapped human possibilities. Put differently, Dublin can serve as the gateway to the universal because it knows something that the world once knew and now needs to relearn: how to enjoy emptying.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
There are other facets to the particular/universal problem in <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;other than geography and the local/global. And it is time to leave Dublin behind and move from questions about the setting of <i>Ulysses</i> to questions about its style. But before I do that, I want to add something to my earlier account of the relation between Dublin and Joyce's Dublin. So far, I have said two things: 1) Joyce's Dublin is not Dublin; 2) Joyce's Dublin makes no sense without Dublin. Those two points are rather generic; they describe the relation between any given historical city and its fictional image. The third point is far more specific: 3) <i>Ulysses</i> goes to heroic lengths to make Joyce's Dublin seem identical to Dublin; it actively confuses the fictional with the real.
</p>

<p>
Joyce, himself, seems to have indulged that confusion, as we know from the accounts of friends like Frank Budgen:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
To see Joyce at work on the Wandering Rocks was to see an engineer at work with compass and slide-rule, a surveyor with theodolite and measure chain . . . [Joyce wrote the episode] with a map of Dublin before him on which were traced in red ink the paths of the Earl of Dudlee and Father Conmee. He calculated to a minute the time necessary for his characters to cover a given distance of the city.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
It is a wonderful image that Budgen paints&#x02014;a portrait of the artist that finally discloses what it means to pare one's fingernails. This is Joyce at his most meticulous and most obsessive: using map, compass, and stopwatch to ensure that his fictional Dublin conforms in every physical way to the city of his birth&#x02014;when of course, he is free to place Bohemia on the coast or Cortez in the Pacific. But Joyce wanted something else, something for which even the term realism may not be adequate.
</p>

<p>
"I want," he had said earlier to Budgen, "to give a picture of Dublin so complete that if the city one day suddenly disappeared from the earth it could be reconstructed out of my book."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Why we should want that from a novel&#x02014;when we could get it from a map or a survey&#x02014;I am not sure. And in the end, <i>Ulysses</i> does not give it to us; there are errors of commission and errors of omission alike. To take one of a number of examples that may or may not matter, the Dalkey tram that Almidano Artifoni hails and misses in the <i>Cyclops</i> episode did not run in 1904.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In another book this kind of slip might be called a contrivance, but in <i>Ulysses</i> it really does feel like an error, because the emphasis on the mimetic is so painstaking. There are more street names, more businesses, more public houses, more government buildings, more statues, more policemen, and more people than in any prior novel&#x02014;all of them mappable and legibly interrelated. There is also more mundaneness than ever before: more eating, drinking, masturbation, bathing, idle chatter, random encounters, 

<b></b>

gossip, shopping, and fatigue. Even the vaunted stream of consciousness method has a realist flavor&#x02014;psychological realism being the favored phrase. It heralds a new, more invasive, brand of realism: an X-ray as opposed to a mirror.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  These kinds of things are hard to quantify, and perhaps it is too much to say that <i>Ulysses</i> is more realist than its predecessors. What can be said, though, is that it contains more unplotted detail than its predecessors. It is more vulgar&#x02014;more detailist&#x02014;than any prior realism.
</p>

<p>
It is also, however, more mythological than any prior realism&#x02014;indeed perhaps more mythological than any realism can be. <i>Ulysses</i>, remember, is a rewriting of the <i>Odyssey</i>&#x02014;a modern myth. "In <i>Ulysses</i>," Joyce once said, "I have tried to keep close to fact"&#x02014;a claim that is only as true as it is absurd.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The title, <i>Ulysses</i>, could not be further from the world of fact; it belongs to a different world altogether. The more precise thing to say is that <i>Ulysses</i> tries to keep close to fact <i>and to the Odyssey</i>. It is as unabashedly mythological as it is tenaciously detailist.
</p>

<p>
At least on the surface, however, realism and mythical method are patently contradictory. Realism imitates the bare facticity and pervasive contingency of everyday life; it opens itself to chance, arbitrariness, and in the extreme case, insignificance (e.g. Bloom mentioning to Lenehan that he could throw away the newspaper, Stephen and Bloom being both dressed in mourning black, Molly thinking that Bloom wants breakfast in bed). And though there is something artificial about this realist arbitrariness&#x02014;it is everywhere staged by authorial design&#x02014;the patina of contingency remains. In realism, it always seems that what happens could also have failed to happen.
</p>

<p>
That is not true of myth. Mythological worlds don't develop; they merely unfold&#x02014;according to the pattern established by the myth itself, as opposed to the whims and choices of individual characters (e.g. Bloom could not have ended up in a public lavatory, as Richard Aldington predicted during the novel's serialization. He was destined to make it home). In mythical method, what happens is what had to happen. More precisely, what happens is what has already happened and whose happening the new text is attempting to reproduce. To the extent, then, that <i>Ulysses</i> borrows its structure from Homeric myth, it undermines its own realist contingencies. And vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Yet, despite their apparent incompatibility, realism and myth coexist in <i>Ulysses</i>.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Joyce's text, as I said before, is only as realist as it is mythological. It treats things as things, and in the very same breath treats things as types. How that is possible is the real question&#x02014;and actually, the same question that we have been tracing all along: how does <i>Ulysses</i> reconcile the particular (mere things) with the universal (enduring myths), how does it manage to treat <i>this</i> and <i>everything</i>?
</p>

<p>
Before we move ahead, though, with this consideration of <i>Ulysses'</i> style, and before we try to resolve the paradox of mythical realism, it is worth pausing over the one solution we have already found: some particulars (Dublin) open into the universal (every place) precisely insofar as they exploit the mereness of their particularity. What matters about Dublin is the pleasure it takes in decline, the sensuous possibilities that appear when life itself has been stripped not just of toilets but of all the technological perversity they imply. One way to extrapolate from Dublin would be to say that what allows the particular to cross into the universal is a certain way of being denuded; the particular 

<b></b>

can become universal only if it is sufficiently bare. If that is right, then the thing to say about Joyce's style is that his realism can be mythical if it, too, is properly bare.
</p>

<p>
The best place to see this is in Joyce's catalogs&#x02014;that most numbing of his stylistic innovations. As an exemplar, consider just the final section of the paean to water in <i>Ithaca</i>, which follows the question: "What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Not only is this a catalog, it is a catalog of catalogs; it is a list whose elements, often enough, are themselves new lists, as in "its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts" and so on. Like so many of Joyce's catalogs, this one works by piling things up until they cease to seem like things, until they add up to something more than a mere sum of parts. To put it more mundanely, it works by making us stop reading.
</p>

<p>
Reading through a Joyce catalog is an excruciating task, rather like drowning. The elements are so capricious, so haphazard, that no single item ever seems significant. Instead, they seem arbitrary and unworthy of careful scrutiny. It does not help that these insignificant elements are also abstruse, and often demand some further investigation. What, for example, is a minch? Or the difference between a lacustrine marsh, a pestilential fen, and a stagnant pool? Could it possibly matter? Even if it does matter, does it matter enough to justify putting <i>Ulysses</i> aside and consulting an encyclopedia or a textbook on environmental science? Probably not. Unfortunately, though, the same is true for every item in the list. They all require more attention than they can repay, which is what makes the catalogs so difficult to read in the first place: it never seems worth it.
</p>

<p>
But that is just the point. The catalogs actively frustrate reading. They demand, in a word, to be skimmed&#x02014;if not skipped altogether. And, what is more, not only do we skip over large chunks of the catalogs, we think we know what we are skipping. To not read&#x02014;to skim&#x02014;is to treat the elements in the catalog as if they were already known, already situated in a meaningful context. Once we have red out what the list is about, we can safely skim to the end. You do not have to know the difference between a marsh and a fen to know that what Bloom appreciates about water is its malleability and its endless potentiality. In some crude sense, that is all the catalog signifies, or all that we as readers can make of it. And it is when we make that extrapolation&#x02014;when we 

<b></b>

treat the unread as if it were known&#x02014;that we pass from the particular to the universal. Skimming is the proof that what had been just a heap of particulars has come to seem more like instances of a greater whole.
</p>

<p>
As predicted, in other words, what makes us skim our way from the world of particularity to the world of universals is the mereness of particularity. It is because Joyce's catalogs are composed of elements at once trivial and refractory that they encourage skimming. The more evocative way to put it would be to say that in Joyce's catalogs particularity has become so dense&#x02014;burdened with an abstruseness far beyond any possible relevance&#x02014;that it explodes into the universal.
</p>

<p>
Not all of Joyce's catalogs work this way, however. Whereas, in the paean to water, skimming means treating things as if they were already known, it can be that skimming means treating things not as if they were known but as if they were unknowable. In those cases, we skim when we realize that we cannot make the extrapolation to the universal. The list of "Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity" from the <i>Cyclops</i> episode provides a good example:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

<p class="noIndent">
It starts out alright, but it is not long before this list of Irish kings and rebels degenerates into satiric motley. Dante Alighieri and Christopher Columbus most definitely do not belong. But even they have a better claim than the Rose of Castile or the Woman Who Didn't&#x02014;at least they are real historical res.
</p>

<p>
The same reading problems apply: how much do you need to know about Mother Maccabee or the plot of <i>The Woman Who Did </i>in order to get the joke? Not much, I imagine, and certainly no more than you need to know about fens and minches. Insignificance and abstruseness seem to be mixed in the same ratio as before. The difference is that in this case we cannot extrapolate because there is no unifying theme, certainly nothing so immediately recognizable as the idea of potentiality was before. There is no universal category that can compass all of these particulars. And if we skim nonetheless, it is not because we have intuited the organizing principle, but rather because we have intuited that there is no organizing principle. What the list <i>is</i> can only be described in terms of what it <i>is not</i>. And once we have red out that it is <i>not</i> a list of Irish heroes and heroines&#x02014;that it is a list that <i>mistakes itself for </i>a list of Irish heroes and heroines&#x02014;all we can do is skim the remainder and enjoy the occasional pleasure of glimpsing a Lady Godiva or a Brian Confucius. The list of things doesn't become a category, as in the catalog of water. Instead, it destroys a category, empties 

<b></b>

it out one heaping exaggeration at a time. To pick up on the image I used before, this time particularity has become so dense that it implodes into nothingness. The catalog simply piles things up until nothing is left.
</p>

<p>
There are, in other words, two kinds of catalogs&#x02014;for ease of reference we could call them totalizing catalogs and chaotic catalogs. Neither kind can be easily read (they are both composed of elements as trivial as they are esoteric.) But they nonetheless function in different ways. Totalizing catalogs, like the paean to water, integrate their elements into a legible whole; what they list are the attributes of some higher order unity. Chaotic catalogs, on the other hand, undermine the very idea of unity; instead, they collapse into a formless mass of details. These two types of catalogs, the totalizing and the chaotic, stand in for two versions of <i>Ulysses</i>. One, that its daily Dublin day is also every day, that somehow all the things and elements are integrated into a meaningful whole. Two, that the vertigo of <i>Ulysses</i> prevents it from amounting to anything other than a chaos of details. Either the particulars explode into the universal or they collapse into a heap.
</p>

<p>
Judging from the catalog of Irish heroes, it is fair to say that <i>Ulysses</i> flirts with chaos as often as it flirts with totality; dissolution is as much a part of its fabric as is universality. We have already seen one other example of this, namely its style. The tension between dissolution and universality is neatly mirrored in the tension between realism and myth. Realism, as I said before, is the genre of chance, contingency, and the bare facticity of material life. It tends to weigh things down, to make them less susceptible to abstraction and more resolutely particular. Its elements belong with those of the chaotic catalog, too dense and too arbitrary to be universalized. Myth, of course, has the opposite effect. It integrates all things into its structure of signification. And in that sense its elements are more fit for the totalizing catalog.
</p>

<p>
All of which returns us to our original questions: Is <i>Ulysses</i> realist or mythical? Is it a chaos of particularity or does it brush against the universal? The disembodied catechist of <i>Ithaca</i> asks the same question, only this time about Bloom:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Notice the shift in conjunctions: entity <i>and</i> nonentity becomes Everyman <i>or</i> Noman. We have seen Bloom on the jakes, and we have seen him reigning over a New Bloomusalem. We have seen him as Elijah and we have seen him as the "aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper" . And the question now is, what does that mean for Bloom? Does it make him a nonentity? Or is being a nonentity just another way of being an entity? Is he still a mythical Everyman or is he just another anonymous modern Noman?<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Or is he perhaps both? And if both, how? What is the status of this character that can channel Odysseus and yet be pummeled with "decomposed vegetable missiles" ? And what can it tell us about the status of his book, and about its style?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
As it turns out, <i>Ulysses</i> alone cannot answer these questions. Instead, we have to look both at <i>Ulysses</i> and at high modernism. The answers, in other words, have to do not just with the structure of Joyce's text but with the structure of thought that nurtured it. The peculiar thing about high modernism is that it doesn't treat Everyman and Noman as alternatives; it knits them together. And the same could be said about totality and chaos: they are not antithetical so much as copresent. Being a high modernist means never having to choose. The nearest example is Joyce's own etymology for Odysseus, which he took to be a combination of Outis, meaning nobody and Zeus, meaning god.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The two fit together effortlessly, and in a form that Bloom can then inherit. If Odysseus can be a nobody and a god, then Bloom can be an Everyman and a Noman, an Elijah who defecates.
</p>

<p>
It is easy enough to multiply examples of this kind from Joyce's work. There is the familiar: "am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?"  and the less familiar "they creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks into eternity" . There is Mulligan's claim&#x02014;about a bottle of Bass&#x02014;that "Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods"  and Stephen's claim that he is "a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void" . Each is an affirmation of the proximity of the mundane and the eternal, even if each imagines that connection in slightly different terms (Stephen thinks they are connected by a void and Mulligan thinks every site is a potential joint.) Everywhere, the universal is brought into communication with the everyday. What <i>Ulysses</i> does is give expression to this strange proximity of the eternal with sand, of realism with myth, or of the particular with the universal.
</p>

<p>
What <i>Ulysses</i> does <i>not</i> do is explain that proximity. It offers no logical explanation, and indeed no mystical explanation either. And the reason it offers no such explanation is that there are no such explanations to be found. There is no theory, no intellectual answer to the questions we have been asking all along: How can <i>Ulysses</i> be both realist and mythical? How can Bloom be Noman and Everyman? How does the novel manage to be both painstakingly particular and unabashedly universal? <i>Ulysses</i> doesn't treat these questions as intellectual problems, to be resolved by way of Hegelian dialectics or theosophic mysticism or Catholic transubstantiation. It treats them, instead, as problems that can only be resolved aesthetically. The strange proximity of the particular and the universal is possible because high modernism makes it possible. <i>Ulysses</i> can be particular and universal because high modernism means <i>the aesthetic reconciliation of material particularity with the universal by way of chaos</i>.
</p>

<p>
Sweeping though it may be, this description of high modernism captures the most distinctive, and most fundamental, aesthetic principle of the movement as a whole. If we look at high modernism as a constellation of artistic practices, then the gravitational force holding that constellation together is the belief that material particularity opens into universality under the right aesthetic conditions. And the right condition, as far as the high modernists were concerned, is that the particular be sufficiently denuded. If the work of art can reduce things to their most vulgar, least interrelated, and most meaningless form, then they will explode into everything. Or simply, the closer you get to chaos, the surer your path to totality.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
To help make sense of this strange relation, I want to juxtapose two accounts of high modernist method: one from Walter Benjamin and one from T. J. Clark.
</p>

<p>
Benjamin, first, is the contemporary who theorized modernism most vividly and also the one who did the most to justify it philosophically. His description of its method begins, however, not with modernism proper but with its fore-history, which he traced back to the baroque <i>Trauerspiel</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
That which lies here in ruins, the highly significant fragment, the remnant, is, in fact, the finest material in baroque creation. For it is common practice in the literature of the baroque to pile up fragments ceaselessly, without any strict idea of a goal, and, in the unremitting expectation of a miracle, to take the repletion of stereotypes for a process of intensification. The baroque writers must have regarded the work of art as just such a miracle.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The fragment, for Benjamin, is the material of miracles. If the fragments that you find can be piled up without purpose, something miraculous may stir. As long, that is, as the fragments are utterly fragmented (lying in ruins), and as long as their arrangement foregrounds their fragmentariness (being without purpose) then the work of art can approach what Benjamin later calls resurrection.
</p>

<p>
And if this is true of the <i>Trauerspiel</i>, it is only more so of the high modernist aesthetic that the <i>Trauerspiel</i> prered. Modernism, too, builds its monuments with fragments. Benjamin had something like that in mind, but here Clark's makes it explicit:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For surely transcendence in modernism can only be achieved&#x02014;is not this central to our whole sense of the movement's wager?&#x02014;by way of absolute immanence and contingency, through a deep and ruthless materialism, by a secularization (a 'realization') of transcendence&#x02014;an absorption in the logic of form . . . modernism was <i>already</i> that dissolution and disabusal&#x02014;but exactly a dissolution held in dialectical tension with the idea or urge to totality, which idea or impulsion <i>alone gave the notion of dissolution</i> (or emptying, or ascesis, or fragment, or mere manufacture, or reduction, or deadpan, or non-identity) <i>sense</i>.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
All these modernist hallmarks&#x02014;emptying and ascesis and reduction and non-identity and fragment&#x02014;do the same kind of aesthetic work, the work that Clark calls dissolution and that I have been calling chaos. The fact that he refers to it as a process (dissolution) while I refer to it as a thing (chaos) is itself telling, because what matters here is the combination of the two: the act of reduction and the stuff that results, fragmentation and its fragments. Picking just one term, however, is less important that recognizing their shared function, which is to open a back door to the universal: transcendence is only possible by way of absolute immanence; dissolution only makes sense when paired with resolution; and chaos belongs with totality. These forces are sealed together not by an intellectual theory but only by the artworks themselves. Dissolution, as Clark has it, empties the world into fragments, but if the fragments are heaped together in as conspicuously arbitrary a way as Benjamin describes then they may explode into everything. That alchemy is what lies at the heart of the modernist aesthetic. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
As examples, think of the fragments that Eliot shores in his <i>Waste Land</i>, of the thin film of images in Pound's fourth canto, of the mere anarchy that signals revelation in Yeats' <i>Second Coming</i>, or of Lily Bart's answer to the meaning of life ("in the midst of chaos there was shape"). In each, you find the quintessential high modernist method: courting fragmentation so as to overcome it. Totality emerges through chaos, and the universal peers through heaps of mere particulars. Modernists break things up in order to find new wholes. You can see it not just in the British literary tradition but throughout European modernism. In Marinetti and Picasso, in Malevich and in Kafka, you find the same mad method: to fragment and fracture and dis integrate, not in order to reassemble but so as to reveal a truth that only fractured objects can reveal. That is the majesty of modernist art: its ability to produce fullness by emptying.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Modernism generates what Joyce playfully called chaosmos.
</p>

<p>
It is only by way of this alchemy that we can answer the questions we've been pursuing all along: the questions about Dublin's uniqueness, about the conflict between realism and myth, and about the relation between the two types of catalogs. This approach does not, I should say, provide a final answer to any of them. But it does offer a set of historically-bounded answers, answers that make sense of a modernist <i>Ulysses</i>, but that suffice for only as long as the assumptions of modernism themselves suffice.
</p>

<p>
The best place from which to craft a response is back on the toilet, this time not with Bloom but rather by way of Wyndham Lewis' accidentally apt response to <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;written, incidentally, as part of his assault on modernism:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It is like a gigantic Victorian quilt or anti-macassar. Or it is the voluminous curtain that fell, belated (with the alarming momentum of a ton or two of personally organized rubbish), upon the Victorian scene. So rich was its delivery, its pent-up outpouring so vehement, that it will remain, eternally cathartic, a monument like a record diarrhoea.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Lewis saw <i>Ulysses</i> as the supreme waste product of Victorian culture, rubbish heap and jakes in one. Everything that was distinctive in Victorian life, Joyce turned into indistinguishable dross. Lewis's word for that is diarrhea. And it is a perfectly good word if what you want to describe is a state absolutely lacking in distinction, or that which is closest to formless stuff. We know, however, that diarrhea means something different in Joyce's Dublin than in Lewis's London. A record diarrhea would fit nicely beside Bloom's story about how he "attained the point of greatest altitude" in a high school pee-off . So long as we are within the context of <i>Ulysses</i> and high modernism, being formless dross means being closest to the universal. Indeed, it is because <i>Ulysses</i> is a diarrhea that it can be universal. In <i>Ulysses</i> the world is reduced to the barest, most fragmented particulars, but those bare, fragmented particulars are the ones that approach the universal. That was true of Dublin and it is true of the book as a whole. Bloom on the jakes is just one re for that, for a city made universal because it is still in touch with its material waste&#x02014;more in touch, in fact, because its decline has made that materiality newly palpable.
</p>

<p>
The catalogs provide yet another re. I suggested before that they stand in for two versions of <i>Ulysses</i>, but that is not quite right. <i>Ulysses</i> does not resemble one catalog or 

<b></b>

the other; it resembles both. Indeed, it is the impossible proximity of these two types of catalogs that makes <i>Ulysses</i>. Only together do they fully embody the alchemy of Joyce's text, its ability to court chaos and produce totality. In the same way, it is only together that realism and myth make sense. Tempting as it may be to think of <i>Ulysses</i> in realist terms&#x02014;and tempted as Joyce was to give his novel unprecedented exactitude&#x02014;the text is not realist but modernist. Realism is not the end but only the means. Through exacting realism, <i>Ulysses</i> reveals the mereness of the world; it dissolves things into bare things and symbols into isolated fragments. But it is only in that denuded form that Joyce's things can take on mythological significance.
</p>

<p>
All of these answers are variants on a single theme: Dublin can be everywhere because it exploits the sensuous possibilities of its decline; Bloom can be Everyman because he is the commonest type of Noman; and <i>Ulysses</i> can be mythical because its realism is sufficiently vulgar. In the most general terms, <i>Ulysses</i> can be universal not in spite of its particularity but only because its particularity is properly bare.
</p>

<p>
As glibly paradoxical as that might sound, it is just not possible to find a more intellectually satisfying answer. In fact, any answer that was more intellectually satisfying would belie the deep and powerful illogic of the modernist aesthetic. If <i>Ulysses </i>has a particular/universal alchemy rather than a particular/universal logic, it is hardly because it failed to meet the demands of logic; rather, it is because no logic could meet the demands of its art. In the end, <i>Ulysses</i> manages to be both particular and universal because it participated in an aesthetic that buried the universal in the mire. Such is the structure of art we call modernist; only through relentless emptying does art reveal new wholes. But the fact that Joyce and his peers found totality at the edge of chaos does not make their work paradoxical, only epistemic. So long as the alchemy of high modernism holds, so too does this particular/universal character of <i>Ulysses</i>.

If modernism had succeeded in finding the aesthetic conditions of chaosmos and in producing totality through a heap of fragments, then these answers would still be ours and the kind of resurrection Benjamin hoped for might already have come. As it happens, though, the alchemy of high modernism cannot hold. The proximity of fragmentation and transcendence which defined their episteme no longer defines ours. And without that aesthetic resolution, <i>Ulysses </i>really does feel like a mere paradox: part chaos and part totality, part realism and part myth&#x02013;without any resolution in sight. Today, then, the question that remains for <i>Ulysses</i> is simple: do we try to restart modernism in hopes of reopening the back door to the universal? Or do we try to re out how just to read this book called <i>Ulysses</i>.

This habit of the early reviewers has not disappeared.

This might not seem like much of a question, given Joyce's lifelong intimacy with the city he never quite left behind. But there is really nothing inevitable about the choice of Dublin. Conrad did not spend his life writing about his native Poland. And the same can be said of Pound and Eliot. The Dublinness of <i>Ulysses</i> is as much a question of narrative function as of authorial biography.

This is how Fredric Jameson describes it: "So in that great village which is Joyce's Dublin, Parnell is still an anecdote about a hat knocked off, picked up and returned, not yet a television image nor even a name in a newspaper; and by the same token, as in the peasant village itself, the ostensibly private or personal&#x02014;Molly's infidelities, or Mr Bloom's urge to discover how far the Greek sculptors went in portraying the female anatomy&#x02014;all these things are public too, and the material for endless gossip and anecdotal transmission."

The origin of this little joke seems to be H.G. Wells' generally favorable review of <i>Portrait</i>, which incidentally accused Joyce of harboring a "cloacal obsession." Anticipating MacHugh, Joyce responded: "Why, it's Wells's countrymen who build water-closets wherever they go." Part of what the incident suggests, of course, is that <i>Portrait</i> piqued its readers in much the same way that <i>Ulysses</i> would five years later. And it is worth mentioning at this point&#x02014;by way of preration&#x02014;that another <i>Portrait</i> reviewer felt that Joyce "would be really at his best in a treatise on drains."

For one thing, it articulates the difference between Joyce and the other famed scatological authors: Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, et al. Joyce's scatology belongs not only to some broad discourse on the irreducible or trans-historical truths of the body but also to a particular dynamic of early twentieth-century capitalism, the one Bloch calls <i>lavatoriality</i>. For an example of that trans-historical discourse, see Bakhtin, Mikhail, <i>Rabelais and his World</i>, Trans. Helene Iswolsky, (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1968).

When Richard Aldington sat down to review the as yet unfinished book in 1921, he made the following glib prediction: "Logically, I see no end to <i>Ulysses</i> except the suicide of Bloom, though no doubt it will terminate in the pleasant purlieus of a public lavatory." He was, of course, wrong on both counts; though Molly does spend a good portion of the final pages seated on her chamber pot, a chamber pot is hardly a lavatory. Still, what is interesting about his claim, and about the reviews more generally, is the degree to which they sensed not just the scatology but in fact the anti-lavatoriality of <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;its resistance to the technological imperialism of the toilet.

One could argue that this is true of most novels; work is rarely an explicit topic. But then, most novels solve this problem by choosing their characters from the upper echelons of society. Where that isn't the case&#x02014;as in Dickens or Zola&#x02014;people work. Only in Joyce's Dublin do the poor get to enjoy their leisure.

All of this, it must be said, is about Dublin <i>as we find it in Ulysses</i>. There were, in fact, factories in Dublin, not to mention slums and a host of other things Joyce didn't manage to include.

<a name="FOOT22" href="#REF22">22</a>.
It should be clear now why the distinction between Dublin and Joyce's Dublin was necessary in the first place. The economic decline that Dublin experienced in the 19th century lends a certain plausibility to the sense of coarseness that Joyce's exploits. But as to whether Dubliners had a unique ability to revel in that coarseness, that is probably a function of nostalgia, distorted memories, and politico-literary necessity on Joyce's part. It is something that he brought to the city through his fiction.

<p class="noIndent">

To be fair, none of this rules out the possibility that <i>Ulysses</i> could be set elsewhere. After all, the fact that Dublin revels in its decline hardly precludes Brooklyn from doing the same&#x02014;especially if what matters is not actual reveling but some susceptibility to reveling in fiction. Still, there are some discriminations to be made. Yes, it could be set elsewhere, but the book would diverge from its present form to the degree that the new setting lacked the generic character of Dublin&#x02014;i.e., the entanglement of backwardness with sensuousness. This, I take it, explains why people who nominate alternate sites seem to gravitate towards underdeveloped cities near burgeoning metropolises&#x02014;the Bronx, Bradford, Jersey City&#x02014;namely because those kinds of cities already share something of Dublin's economic condition. By contrast, nobody seems to have suggested that <i>Ulysses</i> could be set in London. Bloom would never be able to shit there.

Robinson Crusoe would be another example. It has the same doubled structure as <i>Ulysses</i>: minutely detailed on the one hand and persistently allegorical on the other. As to how it manages to reconcile the two, the answer is completely different: not modernism but providence.

There is an added wrinkle here, since Noman is the name Odysseus uses to conceal his identity and escape from the Cyclops. Noman, we could say, is one of the modes of Everyman. But it is, to borrow from Adorno and Horkheimer, the one mode that already belongs to our bourgeois ad-man.

As to the historical conditions that contributed to this redemptive vision of fragmentation, it is not enough to cite the experience of fragmentation in the early twentieth century. There is, no doubt, ample testimony to that fact, as for example Edmund Wilson's: "towards the breaking up of things, furthermore, all the forces of the time seemed to drive: life itself was anarchic and confused; even the unity of capitalism had collapsed." There is, however, a problem with this interpretation. The modernists were hardly the first to feel the fragmentation of everyday life. Wordsworth felt it, Carlyle felt it, Marx felt it, Dickens felt it, Baudelaire felt it&#x02014;indeed it is one of the most characteristic experiences of the social and economic transformation that usually comes under the heading of the industrial revolution. Only with high modernism, however, does the experience of fragmentation become the aesthetic basis for the overcoming of fragmentation.

Most studies of poetry begin with a poem. This one begins with a silence. Like a poem, a silence has both occasion and duration. The duration of this silence is a well-known quantity; after the 1934 publication of his slim volume <i>Discrete Series</i>, the poet George Oppen stopped writing poems, decisively abandoned the class of his origin ("upper class of '29," as he liked to say) to join the Communist Party, and, starting in 1950, lived as a "known subversive" in Mexico to escape F.B.I. harassment for his work as a labor organizer in the Workers Alliance. He would not write another poem for almost 25 years.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The occasion of Oppen's silence is less well understood. Considered as an episode in the history of American literary communism, Oppen's story appears at first unexceptional. In 1930, Michael Gold in the <i>New Masses</i> had condemned the "verbal acrobatics" of modernism as "only another form of bourgeois idleness."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The aesthetics of the "Objectivist" poets with whom Oppen is associated would come under special censure for expressing what Herman Specter would call:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The limited worldview of a "detached bystander": that is, of a person whose flashes of perception for the immediate esthetics of the contemporary scene are not co-ordinated in any way with a dialectical comprehension of the life-process . . . The fatal defect 

<b></b>

of Objectivist theory is that it identifies life with capitalism, and so assumes that the world is merely a waste land. The logical consequence is a fruitless negativism. . . . Impartiality is a myth which defeatists take with them into oblivion.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Two years after Gold's broadside, Sherwood Anderson would suggest that the problem of art was not limited to a particular aesthetic theory or style&#x02014;"impartial" rather than appropriately partisan, nihilistically "objective" about the world as found rather than actively "co-ordinated" with "objective" laws of history by which revolution must eventually be made; it was a more fundamental problem with the nature of artistic labor. On this view, a truly committed artist could best demonstrate his alliance with the working classes by joining them and silencing himself entirely: "if it be necessary that in order to bring about the end of a money civilization and set up something new, healthy and strong, we of the so called artist class have to be submerged, let us be submerged."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The annals of the 30s are filled with the mute inglorious Miltons of the left, submerged for better or worse&#x02014;deliberately or against their will&#x02014;in the interest of a radical politics.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What makes this particular story more remarkable&#x02014;what marks it as an episode in the history of what I prefer to call a radical <i>poetics</i>&#x02014;is that Oppen, once submerged, resurfaced. His next book, <i>The Materials</i>, published in 1962 initiated Oppen's spare but uninterrupted second act in poetry, which would eventually earn him the Pulitzer Prize (for the 1968 volume <i>Of Being Numerous</i>).
</p>

<p>
The long silence at the center of Oppen's career is a mystery sustained by attempts to resolve it, which range from Hugh Kenner's semi-serious denial of the need for explanation (Kenner to Oppen: "it took you 25 years to write the next poem,")<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> , to Rachel Blau DuPlessis' excesses of explanation: "a critique of modernism which ran counter to contemporary critical, poetic, and academic thinking, a choice of activism in a deeply felt political crisis, a process of self-testing, a war injury, and recovery; later these were joined by a set of taboos and inhibitions around parenthood, and a fear of his own power" (<i>Selected Letters,</i> xiv).
</p>

<p>
The poet's own slim self-accounting for the occasion of his silence is more interesting than a long pause, more specific than a catalogue of everything that happened to Oppen in the intervening years:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
25 years to write the next poem means. . . . we didn't know enough from the poetry that was being written; from the poetry we had written. And when the crisis occurred we knew we didn't know what the world was and we knew we had to find out so it was a poetic exploration at the same time that it was an act of conscience.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This not-quite-explanation suggests that it might be necessary and possible to come to know something important about "what the world was" from poetry in a time of crisis in which Oppen was&#x02014;perhaps uniquely among his generation of poets&#x02014;a participant as well as a witness. Oppen fought at the devastating Battle of the Bulge; the infantry division in which he served has been recognized as a "liberator" unit for its participation in the liberation of the Dachau subcamp at Landsberg.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The crisis as it 

<b></b>

"occurred" to Oppen was not just the ideological conflict in America that made him choose temporary exile but the "total war" and the effort at total extermination that preceded and precipitated it.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In his poem "Time of the Missile," (from <i>The Materials</i>) Oppen describes his historical moment as one in which the world&#x02014;reconred by the destructive work of "the mind and eye"&#x02014;has acquired the autonomous capacity to annihilate the life it had formerly sustained. Such a world "can destroy us,/ Re-arrange itself, assert/ Its own stone chain reaction".<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Under these conditions, even the most intimate forms of relationship, which have traditionally served as subjects for poetry and redoubts against history, no longer provide comfort or hope for the future:
</p>

<p>
If we take seriously Oppen's premise that his silence was undertaken in the interest of a poetic solution to the total failure of sociability, we might expect to find that his return to poetry carries about it at least the charge of a problem solved. But what most vexes the attempt to grant some substance to that sense, to credit Oppen's retrospectively implied promise that the next poem would be the next <i>kind</i> of poetry, capable of bearing new knowledge appropriate to a world in crisis, is not just that the terms of the promise are so vague; it is that one doesn't know just where to look to see if they are fulfilled. Oppen's next poems, written after a quarter century's accumulation of worldly knowledge, are&#x02014;to put it perhaps too bluntly&#x02014;not much different in kind than his first ones. Spare, tense lyric fragments linked in abstract sequences larded with sententious and didactic passages, the later poems are no more or less accessible, no more or less obviously <i>engag&#x000E9;</i> than the work of <i>Discrete Series</i>. And even where differences can be heard or seen, Oppen himself seems unwilling to give an account of what precisely they might signify, or to posit a real discontinuity between his early and later work. When, in Section 37 of his long poem "Of Being Numerous," Oppen revisits the first poem of <i>Discrete Series</i>, written thirty-five years earlier, it is with a mind to restate, rather than to reject:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<div class="attribution">

</div>

<p>
In <i>Discrete Series</i>, Oppen suggested that the objects of knowledge ("The knowledge not of sorrow, you were/saying, but of boredom") are attained by attending closely to the 

<b></b>

changeable atmosphere that distinguishes one particular place and time from another: "rain falling, in the distance/ more slowly" . In "Of Being Numerous," knowledge is disclosed by the unchanging particles of dust that hang in the air now, just as they did then: "here still." From the former, we are told, one might learn about the world that one occupies at the moment, "Of the world, weather-swept, with which one shares the century" (<i>DS,</i> 5); the latter discloses "Everything." And yet, even as the poet points out the difference between the poem then and the poem now, telling us that he should have written something other than what he did write, he also writes what he did write. The passage in quotations in "Of Being Numerous" (' . . . approached the window as if to see . . . ') is a <i>quotation</i> of the poem from <i>Discrete Series</i>; indeed, it is a quotation of Oppen's quotation of Henry James. So while the poem seems to say that its views of where knowledge should be sought&#x02014;and of what knowledge is knowledge of&#x02014;have changed since 1934 (just as both have no doubt changed since a "nineteenth century day"), the claim that the difference is <i>substantive</i> is interestingly undercut by the act of self-quotation. If what has changed, in other words, is the idea that true knowledge (of "the world") resides in things that change, like the weather, and the new idea is that knowledge (of "Everything") resides in things that do not, like motes, then the words of poems seem to be more like motes than like weather. Words, <i>les mots,</i> like the dust, are "here still" in 1968 as they were in 1934&#x02014;unchanged even since the "nineteenth century day" that James first wrote them.
</p>

<p>
Of course just as not <i>all</i> the dust in the air in 1968 is the dust in the air in 1934, not all of the words in the later poem are the same as those in the earlier one. By situating old words in a new context&#x02014;replacing the earlier poem's elaborate Jamesian syntax, for example, with the minimalist syntax of "Of Being Numerous," or altering what follows the quotation in order to give a new object to the verb "to see"&#x02014;we discover the difference that context makes for meaning. But Oppen's point is not, as one could imagine, that we need to separate out one kind of word from another, the unchanging, knowledge-disclosing motes from the variable weather-words. Words, or motes, according to Oppen do not just <i>occupy</i> different atmospheres, they <i>are</i> those atmospheres. As the stanza continues:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
What have we argued about? what have we done? 

<p class="blockquote">

Thickening the air? 

<p class="blockquote">

Air so thick with myth the words <i>unlucky 
<br />
</i>And <i>good luck 

<p class="blockquote">

</i>Float in it . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Oppen here undoes the distinction between weather and motes, between words and contexts. Words, insofar as they are "thickened" contexts of argument or action, are the stuff of "myth"&#x02014;shared systems of understanding that are not knowledge- or 

<b></b>

truth-bearing but as arbitrary and amoral as luck. How then can poems, which are, of course, made of words, and so consubstantial with the changeable weather of context, disclose anything, much less "Everything"? The logic of Oppen's analysis demands that such knowledge as poems have&#x02014;if they have it&#x02014;must reside in a distinction not realized in things that can take on formal differences&#x02014;not realized, in other words, in words.
</p>

<p>
In what follows, I do offer an account&#x02014;and a defense&#x02014;of Oppen's poetic knowledge in precisely these terms. More specifically, I argue that for Oppen, it is not in a practice of changeable form but in a practice of unchangeable silence&#x02014;a silence that penetrates his poems as well as bracketing them&#x02013; that we may find, not new knowledge exactly, but a new account of what we mean by knowledge. This argument has obvious consequences for aesthetics: for if silence is not, as Specter would have us believe, a renunciation of poetic work but rather the form that poetic work takes, then we might need an account of what poetry is rather different than the ones we have. But, I shall argue, this change in our account of the ontology of poetry would also have serious consequences for the idea of a poetic politics. Oppen addresses the total failure of sociability caused by "our" lack of knowledge about "what the world was" precisely by reconceptualizing both the subject and object of the verb "to know"&#x02014;and this is a reconceptualization that can and ought to bear on the question of social recognition.

I. Radical Poetics: Some Silences in Poetic History
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In 2003, Farrar Straus Giroux published the twelve-hundred page teal behemoth that is Robert Lowell's <i>Collected Poems</i>. Even if one had not been breathlessly awaiting the appearance of a collected Lowell&#x02014;and twenty-three years after the poet's death is an unconscionably long time to hold your breath&#x02014;it would have been difficult to miss the critical outpouring that has greeted its publication. Most of the notice has been celebratory, though there has been some bickering over the quality of its critical apparatus. But the most persistent objection to the collected Lowell has been leveled at the volume's size: it is too short. Virtually every reviewer has noted, with attitudes ranging from resignation to opprobrium, what Frank Bidart, Lowell's friend and amanuensis characterizes as his "most radical editorial decision": to include the book <i>History</i>, but to omit the stranger and wilder <i>Notebook</i> out of which the later book was carved. I am less concerned to join in the chorus of critique than I am to note the apparent <i>need to note</i> that the longed for "complete" is, in fact incomplete&#x02014;that more, different, and perhaps greater poetry remains. Eager to see this book not just as a doorstop but as an anchor for a poetic present hopelessly adrift; the critic's judgment seems to be that the reading public literally cannot get enough Robert Lowell.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The year before, with much less fanfare, New Directions published George Oppen's <i>New Collected Poems</i>. This is a volume of which it must be said that nobody was exactly waiting for it, happy though we may be to have it. Its publication has gone largely unremarked outside of a sphere of initiates. In marked contrast to the Lowell phenomenon, if there has been a criticism of this already quite slim volume, it is that it is too long. For 

<b></b>

it contains what its editor Michael Davidson has chosen to call "selected unpublished poems"&#x02014;some unspecified number of which, he admits, are not obviously poems at all, but could just as easily be considered drafts, parts of letters, notes, or scrap culled from the poet's so-called "daybooks."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
I will have more to say on this difference later on. For the moment, let me just note that this coincidence of publication is and is not a coincidence. The timing, that is, may be a convenient accident, but the appearance of these two volumes is only the latest salvo in an ongoing battle to define just what the history of twentieth-century poetry consists of; a battle whose ultimate stakes are the shape of the poetic present.
</p>

<p>
To simplify what is already simplification, our prevailing taxonomy for thinking about the history of poetry in the last hundred or so years may be called the "two tradition" model. It divides the poetry of the twentieth (and now the twenty-first) century into a traditionalist or symbolist genealogy in which Modernism is continuous with High Romanticism (beginning, for example, with Yeats' atavistic modernism) and an avant-garde or experimentalist genealogy repudiating it (founded, for example, in Stein's experimental modernism). Each tradition has its historians and its champions; and between them, the critical heirs of Harold Bloom and those of Marjorie Perloff have divided the field. They may agree on very little; but they do produce an impressive consensus about which poet belongs to whom.
</p>

<p>
This effort to produce the legibility of the dense field of contemporary poetry, however, has resulted in a taxonomic engine so frightfully efficient that it has begun to reproduce itself as an unquestioned orthodoxy not just in criticism&#x02014;where it has leapt from being the conclusion of an argument to its premise&#x02014;but in poetry itself. What began as description of the art has been adopted by the artist as an obligation; the poet's felt need to find a tradition has turned into the demand to pick a side; and style has become a sort of a declaration of allegiance. This may sound melodramatic to someone not immersed in the currents of poetic culture, but it is actually quite difficult to overstate the impact this critical division is having on the shape of contemporary poetry. As a general rule, critical and poetic partisans, bent on consolidating, celebrating, claiming or extending one tradition take note of the other just long enough to deride&#x02014;and such derision is a reflexive reaction rather than an analytic one, with the result that poets are cut off from fully half of the history of what ought to be their art.
</p>

<p>
This seemed to me an unacceptable state of affairs, and I initially set out to counter the problems that have blocked literary historians by giving a fuller account&#x02014;one that could include more of what has happened in the name of poetry in the last century; but also offer a more general account&#x02014;one that might provide cause to reconsider whether it makes sense to replace "poetry" with numerous "poetries." But what I discovered is that the completeness of the critical division does, however, point toward a much more interesting and perhaps unprecedented feature of twentieth-century poetry: its major poets' spectacular lack of influence upon, and even acknowledgment of, one another's work. Though Yeats and Pound actually shared a physical home at Stone Cottage as well as metaphysical and occult sources, their utter refusal to consent to what the other had to say is astonishing. Wider still is the gulf between Pound and Stevens, who never 

<b></b>

even rose to the level of mutual misunderstanding: they appear barely to have read each other's work at all.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> .
</p>

<p>
A similar indifference extends into the next generation. George Oppen's letters over a half-century, full of news of the literary world, reveal the horizon of that world to have been quite close. The so-called Objectivist poets like Louis Zukofsky, Carl Rakosi, and Charles Reznikoff are his constant interests and interlocutors, while the poets most often understood as the central res of that generation&#x02014;Elizabeth Bishop or Randall Jarrell, or Robert Lowell&#x02014;hardly even appear as topics of conversation. Elizabeth Bishop similarly erases half the poetic world in her voluminous correspondence: one would look in vain for the barest mention of any poet calling himself an objectivist.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The depth of this division is a silence quite unlike the shrillness of our present acrimony; a separation complete enough that what might initially appear to be a clash of rival poetries begins to look more like two entirely different practices accidentally going by the same name&#x02014;"poetry". Harold Bloom&#x02014;that staunch upholder of the literary "right"&#x02014;has produced a better description of the state of this poetic world than he knew by insisting upon viewing it as the contest, not between styles of poetry, but between "poetry" and "non-poetry."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Very much against the spirit of his dismissal, I would suggest that Bloom's characteristically uncompromising description of the poets of the "left" as "non-poets" actually comes closest to identifying the most distinctive and important features of their work. Picture again the two volumes side by side&#x02014;Lowell's collected, massively loquacious, obsessively revised, a book literally, physically unable to contain all of the poems that there are; Oppen's collected, spare, quiet, padded out even to its slender length by the inclusion of non-poems. This picture requires us to confront and explain something that has been hard for readers interested in the twentieth-century literary left to acknowledge: its poems can sometimes be hard to love, or even to like; for they are made in such a way as to present problems for reception for which our traditional vocabularies of response (aesthetic, affective, pragmatic) are not appropriate. So variously fragmented, estranging, trivial, recondite, or boring are the types of poetry on the left that even critics who champion the work have had to go to great didactic and theoretical lengths to imagine and market alternative sorts of pleasure and interest to compensate for the loss of <i>aisthesis</i>.
</p>

<p>
Still, let there be as many kinds of pleasure and interest as can be conceived; the frequency with which we can encounter "non-poetry" as a literary fact should, if we attend to it, point us in the direction of a theoretical problem not just with the way poetic history has been conceived but with the way that poetry as a genre has been conceived. Stated most simply: the persistent production of non-poems asks that we must entertain the hypothesis that what the poet intends is not, or not always, the poem. The poems to which I gravitate in this essay may appear to be in various ways silent: strange, broken, or otherwise unforthcoming with the pleasures we often expect and demand of well-made poetic objects. This is so, I suggest, because for Oppen (and for others like him), "poetry" is not a techne for producing that class of objects we call poems but a form of intentionality toward persons. What the poet intends&#x02014;insofar as he intends poetry&#x02014;is to indicate, reveal, exemplify, or make manifest a principle that 

<b></b>

minimally distinguishes what a person is. This principle, capacity or "faculty" has historically gone by a variety of names. The sacred, the imagination, reason, and language are some older names. Giorgio Agamben has more recently called it a "potentiality;" Oppen, I will shortly argue, calls it a "curiosity." The social crises that made the twentieth century the most terrible century in Western history repeatedly drive poetry more emphatically than ever before away from aesthetics and toward a radically ontological project&#x02014;toward the effort to reconstruct the category of "the person" in the wake of a crisis that is at once theoretical (the "critique of the subject") and actual (the various failures to treat persons as if they were persons).
</p>

<p>
The poets of the left and those of the right oppose each other not as two opposing practices or principles oppose each other, but rather as an abstract principle opposes the concretion of its own practice. What the poets in whom I am interested suggest is that a renewed humanism (for what else should we call it) would have to take its orientation from a faculty more abstract, more universal, and, paradoxically, less directly engaged with the world than the more pragmatic definitions of identity undertaken in the name of any particular social order. A radical poetics, that is, requires us to postulate a difference between "subjects" and "persons": if subjects are understood by poems to possess qualities (voices, histories, features, bodies, rights, obligations, attachments, etc.) the persons intended by the poetic principle are defined by possessing <i>value</i>. They possess the sheer potential to be integrated into whatever social system, and that potential constitutes a sufficient demand.
</p>

<p>
Ezra Pound declared that a history of the art could only be gotten through its masterworks.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  I would suggest that a history of the poetic principle is best told through its limit cases. The goal of the poets I discuss is not to define the individual or dramatize the individual in terms of some psychological or philosophical account of subjectivity; nor is it to secure the individual in service to some particular form of social life. The goal of these poets is rather to make the person appear anew (non-theoretically) as a value-bearing fact&#x02014;as the necessary <i>ground</i> of social life&#x02014;and to offer this most abstract premise of personhood as a necessary precursor to any effective politics.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  And as the example of Oppen will help to clarify, the poetry that most directly addresses the purposes I have ascribed to the art is one that sacrifices its formal coherence, its beauty, and even its very perceptibility to the task.

II. Crusoe's Silence
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The serial poem, "Of Being Numerous,"  is representative of the many pleasures of reading Oppen, but also of one of the major difficulties: for a poet who has been labeled an "Objectivist," he makes it extraordinarily difficult for us to feel grounded in a known or knowable world. Though he would praise above all others the "small precise . . . overwhelming gentle iron lines and images" of Reznikoff, whose poems emulated their subject matter, "the girder, still itself/ among the rubble," Oppen's poetic precision seems more that of intellect than of iron. By the end of the first five sections of the poem, we have swum through such abstract nouns as "things" 

<b></b>

(specified only as "An unmanageable pantheon" [148]); "images" (specified not at all [148]); and "people" (of whom all that is said is that "We encounter them" [149]). Verbs are equally abstract and technical ("encounter" is a case in point), or else they appear transformed into passive substantives like "Occurrence, a part/ Of an infinite series, // The sad marvels" . It is only when we reach section 6 of the poem that we wash up at last on the shore of a proper name:
</p>

<p>
Still, any orienting relief we might feel here at stumbling upon a named person&#x02014;even a fictional one&#x02014;must be tempered by the fact that that person is presented to us not under the auspices of perception but rather through the lens of interpretation. The poem suggests that what is of interest about Crusoe is not the vivid and loquacious fact of his own story&#x02014;<i>The life and strange surprizing adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, mariner: who lived eight and twenty years, all alone in an un-inhabited island on the coast of America, near the mouth of the great river of Oroonoque; having been cast on shore by shipwreck, wherein all the men perished but himself : With an account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by pyrates / Written by himself</i>&#x02014;but rather the fact that, quote, "we" have articulated judgements about him.
</p>

<p>
The quotation marks I have placed around "we" are a way of noting those that Oppen has placed around "rescued"&#x02013; and those are quotation marks worth noting. Oppen, like many of his contemporaries, is a quoting poet. Many of his quotations represent moments of philosophical engagement; their sources (Maritain, Plato, Heidegger, Kierkegaard) are traceable with minimal effort; others derive from personal engagements (with Mary Oppen, Zukofsky, Reznikoff), many of these sources were attributed with the aid of the poet himself. But in this instance and a few others in which the 

<b></b>

quotation consists of a single word and no attribution is given ("And he fails! He fails, that meditative man! And indeed they cannot 'bear' it." [153]) the implication is that what is being "cited" is a general attitude rather than a particular one attributable to an individual source.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I will propose two quite specific sources for the judgement that Crusoe's return to civilization constitutes a rescue: The first is in Marx's <i>Capital</i>; the second in a set of debates surrounding Wittgenstein's <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. And while both of them might have been known to Oppen (the first one certainly was, and the second very probably),<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  I am actually not at present interested in deciding the question of whether the allusion is in fact an allusion. Choosing between these "sources" really entails choosing between two very different philosophical accounts about what it means to have a general attitude. The question is less a matter of what person to whom Oppen means to refer the quotation, than of what the quotation marks tell us that Oppen thinks a "we" is, and what it means for "us" to make judgments about, or indeed to refer to a person altogether.
</p>

<p>
For Oppen, the most ready-to-hand context for the re of Crusoe would certainly have been Marx,<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  specifically the fourth section of volume one of <i>Capital</i>, "The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret Thereof,"<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  where he brings up the Crusoe story specifically in order to contest the way the re of Crusoe had been used in the past by political economists to naturalize and universalize the acquisitive impulse and so give natural warrant to capitalism. For Marx, the judgement that Crusoe needs rescuing could only be true of a Crusoe whose "solitude" was a sham in the first place, "an illusion and nothing but the aesthetic illusion of the small and big Robinsonades" (xx). The novelistic Crusoe's inexplicably "fortunate" salvaging of the gold for which he claimed to have no concern, like his excessive bower-building, is simply a dramatization of the fact that the Crusoe of the political economist's Robinsonade possesses desires for luxury that are given to him, as it were, from the outside (as products of the historical order of which he is a product) rather than arising from his native inclinations. Such a Robinson may appear to be alone, but as a good bourgeois he carries his whole class with him wherever he goes.
</p>

<p>
In his deceptive surfaces and self-deceiving depths, Marx's Crusoe most clearly resembles, not Oppen's, but another poetic Crusoe, that of Elizabeth Bishop in her poem "Crusoe in England."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Bishop's Crusoe comes off at first as a good empiricist who spends his time as a castaway diligently numbering his island's volcanoes (fifty-two in all) and cataloguing the variegated colors of his basalt beaches. But despite his diligence, he is nonetheless unable to perceive his island as it is&#x02014;because his sense of scale resides elsewhere. Longing for home, he sees turtles as teakettles, snail-shells as iris-gardens, and waterspouts as "glass chimneys, flexible, attenuated,/ sacerdotal beings of glass" , conflating in thought the domestic and the spiritual in just that way that we would call bourgeois.
</p>

<p>
This is nowhere more evident in Bishop's poem than in her Crusoe's attitude toward objects. When Crusoe, having been returned to civilization, contemplates the one tool that he did not make, but that enabled all the rest of his labor, what initially looks like a 

<b></b>

proper recognition of worth (commensurate with its great utility) is quickly transformed into that phantasmatic form of valuation that Marx termed fetishization:
</p>

<p>
Nothing in Marx's account of commodities suggests that there is a problem with developing intense emotional investments in objects that are particularly important to our survival. But the very specific personifying language Crusoe uses here belongs to what Marx calls "the mist enveloped regions of the religious world" in which "the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the human race" .
</p>

<p>
Bishop's genteel Crusoe&#x02014;like the political economists who celebrate Crusoe&#x02014;has what Marx would take to be false description of his experience. That is to say, Crusoe misrecognizes his nature (indeed, he misrecognizes it as natural), and therefore he talks about all things in a false language that is at once utterly persuasive and utterly bankrupt. The drama of the poem turns on the way that Crusoe's ability to articulate his exquisitely attuned sensibilities, his feelings of alienation and anomie, breaks down in moments of great pathos, demonstrating the depths of his self-misunderstanding.

<p>
Crusoe's impoverished effort to acknowledge the existence of another person may not quite reach the complete inversion of values Marx imagines when he describes the state of commodity culture as one that imagines "material relations between persons and social relations between things" (Marx, 321). Persons, as well as objects, can legitimately be thought "nice." But the barrenness of Crusoe's recollection, framed as it is from the language of banal conversation rather than the language of authentic attachments, is the best evidence of this Crusoe's determination by a reductive discourse of value and a deforming state of social relations.
</p>

<p>
It is certainly possible to read Oppen's Crusoe in similar terms. Such a reading of "Of Being Numerous" might argue that Oppen intends "our" judgment that Crusoe has been "rescued" to coincide with the political economist's mystifications and with Crusoe's mystified self-assessments. For "us," bound to a misunderstanding of value that we cannot grasp or adjust because it lies external to us, Crusoe's island can only look like a version of our own world. This Oppen would seem actually to <i>share</i> Specter's concern that Objectivist theory "identifies life with capitalism, and so assumes that the 

<b></b>

world is merely a waste land," and to set up both Crusoe's plight and "our" reaction to it as a form of inoculating self-criticism. On this account, Crusoe's "rescue" (like the judgment that it is a rescue) is merely the ironic and inevitable fulfillment of the particular form of "numerousness" that his apparent solitary singularity conceals.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, later in the poem, Oppen does provide some warrant for reading him this way, elaborating further on the inability to return to the ground of our activity in order to perceive the actual worth of anything. Contrasting us to man in his primitive state, who can see things as they are, Oppen finds that we are:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

Unable to begin 
<br />

<p class="noIndent">
The fact that "everything is already here" for the choosing makes choosing into shopping, a mystified form of "voluntarism" that conceals the determinism of an economic system that issues only in brutality to others and to the self. It is the same falsely voluntaristic account of "choice," Marx would argue, that underlies the liberal fiction that all social relations are contractual; and it is the same one that leads Bishop's Crusoe to imagine himself responsible for his own alienation:

<p>
But at this point, we must confront the difference between Bishop's Crusoe and Oppen's. Bishop's poem is, first and foremost, a complex drama of <i>tone,</i> whose purpose is to evoke by means of voice a gently ironized sympathy, and on that ground, an identification. That is, the point of Bishop's elaborate ventriloquism of Crusoe's language of self-deception is to see <i>our</i> language in the light of his language and to see Crusoe's behavior in the light of our behavior: to see Crusoe as precisely like ourselves. While Bishop may in fact believe that a particular social and economic order gives determinate shape to&#x02014;or even exacerbates&#x02014;the misrecognitions that constitute our worldview, her poem is nevertheless consoling on the very ground of its criticism. We may be deceived and thwarted by that fact that what we take to be our languages of expression and valuation are given to rather than made by us, but such ordinarily tragic and ordinary thwartings are precisely what we share, what makes us us.
</p>

<p>
Certainly Oppen, too, is capable of pointing out false consciousness of all kinds; he, too, is particuarly aware of its consequences for language, which is reduced to "a ferocious mumbling, in public/ Of rootless speech" . This critique of the way language is abused by being ideologized lies behind a poem like "Song, The Winds of Downhill," which speaks of a longing to jettison those features of language the poet 

<b></b>

calls "tone" and "pose," aspects which suggest the stresses placed on intention by social obligation&#x02014;in favor of words like "would with and" that are hard to poison through misuse because it is hard to say they mean anything at all .
</p>

<p>
But we cannot carry this reading of Oppen as a critic of ideology internalized through language too far. Oppen's Crusoe <i>has</i> no apparent psychology which might be read as ideology&#x02014;if only because he makes no appearance at all. We cannot assess the state of his consciousness because we have nothing to go on. He is not loquacious, like the novelist's Crusoe, and therefore he is not acquisitive like Marx's, nor survivalist like the political economist's. He is not even, like Elizabeth Bishop's "Crusoe in England," pathetic or sympathetic, for he has neither tone nor pose: he is <i>silent</i>. In fact, the only thing that we know about Oppen's Crusoe is what "we" say about him.
</p>

<p>
The significance of <i>that</i> fact depends on how we read the syntax of the stanza and construe its causal logic. One could, for example, read the verse as an attenuated argument across the period: "We are pressed on each other. . . . so we have chosen." Read this way, "so" means "as a result": "We are pressed on each other, and as a consequence we have chosen the meaning of being numerous." The implied account of causality here is consistent with the Marxian narrative; it suggests that "our" positive evaluation of Crusoe's return is not really anything we have deliberated or willed. It is, rather, a belief about the nature of persons that is determined by their particular historical condition of "numerousness." "Pressed" on each other, we are transformed by oppressive social relations into reactive objects rather than active subjects.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, equally permissible to parse the verse so that it reads: "Crusoe we say was 'rescued'. . . so we have chosen." Read this way, "so" would mean something like, "in this manner." This second reading raises the possibility that what is being represented here is not a dramatized foreclosure of choice but an explanation of the manner in which "we" come to decide upon the meaning of any thing. It points us, in other words, toward the other possible source for the image of Crusoe, not in a discourse of class, but in a discourse of mind; toward a series of debates surrounding what has come to be known as Wittgenstein's "private language argument."

When Crusoe enters this debate, as he did in a series of explications of Wittgenstein's later thought that followed rapidly on the heels of the English publication of the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> in 1953, he is obviously not the Crusoe of fiction, nor the "congenital Crusoe" of the political economist. He is rather, a <i>structural</i> Crusoe: a man not left in isolation or reared in isolation but regarded in isolation&#x02014;prior to and apart from our construal of any of his actions.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  What has come to be known as Wittgenstein's "private language argument" concerns not just "language" as such; the classic example of a rule-governed activity, used by Saul Kripke in his influential exposition of the paradox in <i>Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language</i>,<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  is the rule of addition. But Kripke selects a mathematical rule for his example only in order to emphasize the generality of the critique&#x02014;finally, it applies to <i>all</i> rule-governed actions, whether mathematical, linguistic, or merely conceptual.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Briefly stated, the skeptical paradox runs as follows: imagine that you are confronted by a resolutely skeptical questioner who wants some justification for your belief that 

<b></b>

your action is consistent with a rule. Or, more precisely, the skeptic wants to know how you know that when following a rule you are acting in accordance with that rule as you have intended it in the past. The problem is that you have in your life set out to follow any given rule only a finite number of times, in a finite number of cases or contexts. (In Kripke's mathematical example, the rule is the rule of addition, and the highest number you have ever added is 56.) What the skeptic is suggesting is that while you may have thought you followed that rule in the past because you performed according to its dictates in every case you with which you have been confronted <i>so far; </i>you cannot be certain that the rule you in fact intended was not some <i>other</i> rule&#x02014;one that stipulated that you behave as you have in all the cases you have encountered thus far, but stipulated something else in some as-yet-unencountered and future case. Kripke's example: When you followed the rule for "plus" in the past, the function you intended might indeed have been to add two numbers together&#x02014;for in the case of every number with which you have thus far been confronted, that is what you did. But on what basis, he asks, can you assert that the rule you actually intended was not the rule more properly known as "quus"? According to the quus function, one proceeds to add all numbers lower than 57 as one would if performing addition; but in <i>quuadition</i>, the answer to any problem containing a number higher than 56 is the number 5. You have never added a number over 56 before; you have therefore never formulated any intentions regarding such numbers. You therefore cannot challenge the skeptic's claim that you had meant <i>quus</i> all along by appealing to or reporting on your prior mental state.
</p>

<p>
One possible reply to the skeptic might be to observe that the number of times I have applied the rule of addition cannot possibly matter, since a rule of this kind is not limited in its application to a finite number of cases. Addition is, rather, a <i>general </i>rule (an algorithm) about what to do when confronted by two groups of objects&#x02014;i.e. you combine them and then count the larger pile. But, the skeptic might retort, this objection also depends on a rule which, in your experience, has only been applied over a finite number of cases&#x02014;the rule in the exemplary case being the rule of counting. Perhaps in every previous instance, the skeptic suggests, "by 'count' [you] formerly meant quount, where to 'quount' a heap is to count it in the ordinary sense, unless the heap was formed of two heaps, one of which had 57 or more items, in which case one must automatically give the answer '5'" . Your objection that counting, too, specifies a rule that is independent of the number of objects counted does not help matters; for a version of this critique can be made about any reduced rule, going, as it were, all the way down&#x02014;until you come to rest upon a rule that you must admit is irreducible to any other&#x02014;and that rule too will be susceptible to the same skeptical critique.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion of this argument is intended to be fatal to your conviction that you are behaving now as you once did, since you can no longer be certain what you once did&#x02014;whether in fact you meant plus or <i>quus</i>. The problem Wittgenstein's paradox poses is not just an epistemological problem that makes it impossible to be certain that the rule you intend now is the same rule you intended before. It is also an ontological problem, potentially devastating to the idea of meaning altogether. For, Kripke argues, "if there was no such thing as my meaning plus rather than quus in the past, neither 

<b></b>

can there be any such thing in the present" . The logical outcome of the paradox is the deeply anti-Cartesian conclusion that there is, <i>even now,</i> no fact about you or your mental state that distinguishes meaning plus from meaning quus. And if there is nothing about you that constitutes your intending one rule rather than another, then "there can be no such thing as meaning anything by any word" .
</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein's solution to the "private language argument" is offered, not as a redemptive account of individual psychology, but in terms of a community of language users, or what he calls a "form of life" (<i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, 8e). A form of life, as Kripke defines it, is "[t]he set of responses in which we agree, and the way they interweave with our activities" . According to Wittgenstein, then, I ascribe rule-following to you when your behavior is consistent with my "form of life," by which I mean that a) you give the same responses I am inclined to give in a situation like yours, b) you interact "properly" with my community, and c) the ascription of rule-following to you has some utility in that community. While there are no truth conditions, then, for determining whether a person follows a rule, there are assertability conditions for our judgment that he does so.
</p>

<p>
In Wittgenstein's paradox, Robinson Crusoe presents us with two problems, both of which are relevant to Oppen's Crusoe in "Of Being Numerous."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The first is an "internal" problem about determining the nature&#x02014;or, in fact, the existence&#x02014;of one's own intentions. Considered in this context, Oppen's previously odd-seeming locution about Crusoe suddenly makes a great deal of sense as an argument about intentionality. By saying "so we have chosen," Oppen means not so much that "we" have decided (through internal deliberation or ideological formation) that it is better for Crusoe that he has been brought home; he means that "we" have decided something by talking about him in a particular way. There may not be truth conditions for determining the meaning or value of Crusoe's actions, (since they have no internal or intentional mental realization) but there are assertibility conditions for our calling his return a rescue. And indeed, as the verse goes on to imply, it is <i>only</i> by talking about things in a particular way&#x02014;by sharing a particular form of life&#x02014;that "we" exist as a communal entity at all.
</p>

<p>
But it is at this point that the silence of Oppen's Crusoe becomes particularly important&#x02014;and particularly troublesome for my hypothetical Wittgensteinian Oppen. For what can "we" make of Oppen's decision not to describe Crusoe's activity <i>at all</i>? Given a structural Crusoe, it is only when we interpret a person's responses as being in some way consistent with our own that we, in Kripke's exceedingly evocative and resonant phrase, "take him into the community." But what if Crusoe's responses did not resemble any we knew? What if his life was so different from any we might imagine as to be incomprehensible, imperceptible, <i>silent</i>? This is the second "external" problem that Crusoe poses. If there was nothing about Crusoe's mental state, nothing beyond our interpretive acts, that constituted his meaning anything in particular, from whence derives our inclination to take that person&#x02014;man considered in isolation&#x02014;into our form of life in the first place?
</p>

<p>
Kripke, tentatively though quite properly, phrases the question as a question not just of epistemology but of ethics: "If Wittgenstein would have any problem with Crusoe, 

<b></b>

perhaps the problem would be whether we have any 'right' to take him into our community, and attribute our rules to him" . Kripke acknowledges that "if we think of Crusoe as following rules, we are taking him into our community and applying our criteria of rule following to him" . But he does not exactly explain why we should think of him as following a rule. How we recognize rule-following as such, what the tests of rule following in general might be, if they do not entail the judgement that someone obeys our rules, is not at all clear.
</p>

<p>
Oppen here addresses himself to an aspect of the hard problem of other minds that Wittgenstein does not raise: that in some important respect all persons are silent, all responses sufficiently unlike our own to cast radical doubt that we are faced with a fellow rule follower&#x02014;which is to say, a potentially recognizable fellow person. If, as Oppen's Crusoe's silence suggests, silent singularity is in some crucial sense the norm, then reason decrees (and history as Oppen experienced it confirms) that it will be all too easy to make mistakes about persons: not just to fail to treat them justly, but to fail to perceive their presence or credit their existence altogether. Such normative silence threatens at every moment to lead to the failure of acknowledgement and care Oppen calls "the shipwreck of the singular."
</p>

<p>
If we were operating within some other field of inquiry&#x02014;of cognitive psychology, for example&#x02014;we might find ready to hand a set of arguments proposing to elaborate a set of procedures for the empirical detection of rule following altogether. But for Oppen, the poet, the solution is posed, not as a formal method or a form of reason, but as a form of patience, as a general attitude&#x02014;as a silent extension of credit. And the poetic form silent patience takes is, typically, the break, the pause, the caesura.
</p>

<p>
Thus the significance of this section break between 6 and 7, which separates the act of "choosing" from the mental states ("oppressed, bewildered") that determine choice and separates it, too, from the actual choices that are made (the "meaning of being numerous"). This pause illustrates that a capacity or disposition to value is independent from, though necessary for, the particular instances of valuing that the capacity makes possible.
</p>

<p>
Section 6, then, considered in isolation, suggests yet another possible way of seeing "so": "Crusoe we say was/'Rescued'/So [you can see] we have chosen." And what you can see we have "chosen" is sociability itself, conceived, not as a particular vocabulary, but rather as the obligation to say <i>something</i> about Crusoe, whether we recognize him as being part of our "form of life" or not&#x02014;because we regard him as having <i>a</i> form of life, as being a person like ourselves, though not necessarily as our kind of person. After this choice is made, the particular choice of the meanings we come to assign him ("the meaning of being numerous") may be determined by our form of life, or they determined by the relations of production that structure and give form to our lives (pressed, oppressed, bewildered). But the fact that we choose a meaning is dependent only on our acknowledgement of the existence of the other person. We do not "rescue" Crusoe by interpreting his behavior as being consistent with our own; we have already rescued him by granting that his activities need interpretation.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
This is the attitude toward persons that Oppen, citing yet another quoted (though this time, attributed) term, called "curiosity." The final section of "Of Being Numerous" consists in its entirety of a letter written by Walt Whitman:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Whitman: 'April 19, 1864 
<p class="blockquote">
The capitol grows upon one in time, especially as they have got the great re on top of it now, and you can see it very well. It is a great bronze re, the Genius of Liberty I suppose.

<p class="blockquote">
Curious . . . '
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
It is quite striking to note that the poem's conclusion on Whitman's letter quite deliberately resolves, not on a description of how the statue "looks" [<a href="#1">re 1</a>]. Despite Whitman's assurances, the viewer&#x02014;whether close up and at a steeply raked angle, or near level but from a great distance&#x02014;cannot see the statue atop the capitol dome "very well" at all. Instead, Whitman's insistence on his perception of the obduracy of the great bronze becomes the occasion to describe a whole variety of subjective, imaginative, and affective responses: personification, the registration of preferences (for the way something looks at particular times of day); indeed, perception in this poem becomes something like a vision of subjectivity itself as it registers those particular qualities of sundazzle on bronze that are the result of one's particular position relative to a thing, and the changes in attitude, atmosphere, or weather that constitute subjectivity across time ("it grows upon one in time").
</p>

<p>
Nor does Oppen resolve on an account of what it looks like [<a href="#2">re 2</a>], for the poetic insistence upon likeness is also what makes possible the misperceptions or projections we call ideological.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Whitman's ability to see the feathered headdress that the Statue of Freedom atop the capitol dome wears as a star is finally not all that different from the reason why the statue atop the Capitol dome wears a feathered headdress in the first place, rather than a phrygian cap as originally intended. Both the constructed re (Crawford's) and the red re (Whitman's) are attempts to secure the legitimacy of a new government by recasting it as having highest possible sanction. For Whitman, union begins in the heavens; in 1863 America, it began by avoiding the divisive implications of topping the statue of freedom with the symbol of freed slaves.
</p>

<p>
"Of Being Numerous" resolves instead on an <i>attitude toward looking</i>. "Curious" is itself a curious term; it should be contraposed to "beautiful," or even to "meaningful." Isolated in white space, set silently apart from the fluent discourse of the letter, curiosity represents the jettisoning of a concept of "art" for a stance toward the object. Curiosity toward the other redounds upon the self; it is not a description of this object, nor is it a criterion by which we value the object; it is the name of the disposition to perceive and to value.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  It is typical of Oppen's poetry that we find consensus-type judgements (of beauty, of meaning) separated from the foundational premise of "curiosity" or care that of necessity precedes them in fact, though it may follow them in verse. Note, for example, the reversed blazon in section 15:

<b></b>

<p>
Here, the "androgynous" chorus seems at first to imply that persons can only exist insofar as they are acknowledged. And while it is true that they are individuated by being literally incorporated by communal criteria, this peculiar chora seems already mysteriously to possess the power of speech, a prior speech that voices what we might call the human (collective) capacity to be found.</p>

The same dynamic structures what is perhaps Oppen's best known short lyric, "Psalm," where the difference between what is judged "beautiful," and the ground on which judgements of beauty are made possible is once again indicated by a silence or caesura, here marked diacritically not by a space but by the dash:
</p>

The poem's epigraph&#x02014;"Veritas sequitur . . . "&#x02014;invokes and alters Aquinas' doctrinal <i>Veritas sequitur esse</i> ("truth is a consequence of the existence of things"), a doctrine 

<b></b>

originally formulated to counter and divinize the Aristotelian (and, we might say, proto-Wittgensteinian) idea that truth is a consequence of cognition about things. But Oppen conspicuously and typically omits Aquinas' <i>esse</i>, which contained in it the assumption of the divine origin of "thing," (which, in other words, inscribes the "truth" that follows from objects as a particular theologically sanctioned form of value) and replaces it with a paraphrase posed less as a metaphysical dogma and more as an astonished exclamatory premise.
</p>

<p>
The difference between doctrine and premise is made even clearer in the Daybook where Oppen meditates on the same passage:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<p>
In the first formulation, Oppen strikes out the dogmatic proposition of (theological) certainty and replaces it with a statement of <i>logical</i> necessity. In the second, squared-off formulation, it is not "things," but simply the premise that an abstract "something" exists that makes subsequent "truth" possible. This something&#x02014;less certain, more abstract, but also more humane&#x02014;is what Oppen means by "knowledge." This intention towards persons, the attitude: "That they are there" is unconditioned by particular historical forms of belief, unspecified as to the particular qualities of objects, but it is forcefully stated. From this "judgment" for the existence of a necessary truth, all other sorts of judgments (like sympathy, like small beauties) may follow.

It is hard not to feel sympathy for Oppen, whose long poetic silence was subtended by bold-faced repetitions of "visionary" intent that have gone unheard. It is as if the poet himself was speaking a private language. The earliest criticisms of Oppen's earliest work denied the poet's vision by focusing on the way that the particulate materiality of his poems rendered them incomprehensible, characterizing their maker as a sort of idiot-boy stutterer: 

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Mr. Oppen's offering exhibits that extreme parsimony of words that is taken today to imply infinite profundity. I don't believe it implies anything of the kind. His writing is like listening to a man with an impediment in his speech.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
More recently, however, precisely this critique has been revived as praise: "I am not sure I completely understand this poem," admits Peter Nicholls when confronted with the late poem "Occurrences" , "but nor am I sure that I am meant to. The syntax seems broken, precarious, though to describe it as fragmented would misleadingly assume a reconstitutable logic of propositions" (<i>Objectivist Nexus</i>, 250).
</p>

<p>
As I suggested at the beginning of the essay, one of the central features by which Oppen's "alternative" poetic is distinguished as alternative is by its supposed emphasis on a textual materiality that eschews claims of "vision"&#x02014;or even of propositionality altogether. Thus, in Michael Davidson's reading, as in Nicholls', "Oppen's paratactic logic, truncated syntax and ambiguous use of antecedents" do not signify an impediment of speech but a resistance to it. Such fragments "embody the shifting attentions of a mind dissatisfied with all claims to closure.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  For Davidson, the workings of that shifting and resistant mind are most emphatically on display, not in the finished and published texts of Oppen's poems, but in what he calls the "palimptexts" of the daybooks&#x02014;the drafts of poems in which line revisions are typed on cut scraps and pasted on drafts in impasto twelve leaves deep; the "book" formed by hammering a set of sheets into a piece of plywood with a nail; the "fascicles" fastened by metal screws, brads, and pipe-cleaners. But though his description is filled with romance, his point is avowedly anti-romantic; Davidson means to argue that for Oppen, writing was not the act of creating unified and rarified "works," but rather a sort of homely work:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
My purpose in describing the material component of Oppen's work is to suggest the degree to which writing was first and foremost something ready-to-hand&#x02014;as immediate as a coat hanger or a piece of wire.

</div>

<p>
One might point out that the "little words" used to write poems on paper are themselves visible representations of the little words Oppen liked so well. But the point of Davidson's parallel between pipe-cleaner and word is less that one part of a work should be seen to be in "dialogue" with another or that the meaning of any part of a work is "qualified" by acknowledging the contingent materiality of the language in which it is 

<b></b>

rendered; it is rather that meaning&#x02014;as something that does not change&#x02014;is effectively <i>vitiated</i> by that materiality. The word, viewed as a commonplace object, makes writing a form of jury-rigged, practical, daily labor that issues not in meanings at all, but in objects. "Dialectic," on Davidson's account&#x02014;and on many accounts like it&#x02014;is not a movement from contradictory assertions toward a higher synthesis; rather, by taking materiality to qualify meaning out of existence, the proponents of this version of "dialectic" make synthesis unnecessary by canceling out anything so brutally final as an assertion, and imagine that political consequences follow from the rejection of a conceptual finality seen as inseparable from violence. Or, as Jerome McGann's argues:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . when the physical aspects of writing&#x02014;its signifying mechanisms&#x02014;are made a conscious part of the imagination's activities, writing opens up the subject (and even to a limited extent the possibility) of unalienated work.

<p>
Of course, Oppen is not afflicted with other-speech&#x02014;a verbal disability that threatens to exclude the speaker from a speech-community altogether. But, as may be evident from his insistence that his work is "NOT A DIALECTIC," neither does he intend that his poems embody difficulty in order to suggest some other to speech&#x02014;a material text that would be "unreconstitutable" in terms of some "form of life" or another. Rather, if Oppen's poems seem "broken" or "parsimonious" it is because he does not really want to be making "poems" at all:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
Over and over again we find Oppen trying to indicate one great "vision"&#x02014;though it turns out to be an extraordinarily difficult proposition for his readers to see: that he aspires "to construct with language something other than language," and that such a construction properly entails not a craftsmanlike attention to the origin and function of words but rather an indifference to words: "the poem begins without the words or with one word or with any word." The something other than language that is intended by this sort of poem is not a meaning; or, as Oppen puts it, "It is not what a poem says, but what it is talking about" (Sulfur, 220). What a poem is talking about with any, one, or no words is "poetry," which Oppen understands not as a collection or series of objects, not as a set of rules about their proper construction, but as what he calls "the power to originate": "the power to originate lies not in aesthetic man (the exercise of taste) but in ontologic man; man as he confronts the world" .
</p>

<p>
These statements that I have collected here from the strange and scattered fragments of Oppen's notebooks are not, I think, poems. Rather, they address a problem that Oppen sees as endemic to poems: no matter how spare they become, they are still too fluent. Poems always seem to be saying something; or, in what amounts to the same thing, they are always making themselves available for particularizing judgement. This is what Oppen means when he says that all poems are always "bad" insofar as they fail 

<b></b>

of silence. Silence, on the other hand, is not fluent enough; not <i>properly</i> "inaudible," it appears merely to be saying nothing at all. The daybooks form a continuous running undersong whose genre is uncertain&#x02014;as is, therefore, the relationship to readers that is projected by this form of writing. If neither poems nor silence alone succeed in "talking about" the right thing; the daybooks, then, imagined as a speaking silence, aim to be at once fluent and inaudible&#x02014;aim, not to say anything but to "disclose everything."
</p>

<p>
Oppen writes, in section 10 of "Of Being Numerous":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

<p>
As with the "man" the speaker describes, critics have listened and failed. What Oppen means to point to (again, gesturing at his point with the resonant silence that separates the articulated sense that poetic utterance "will fail" from its compensatory solution) is the determination to listen: "But I will listen to him speak." Oppen addresses the problem of other minds not by submitting them to the chances of style but by at every moment supposing that there is someone there to understand, someone who means something, and who needs us, not in order to exist, but just to <i>find them.</i>

Oppen's account of "art" cannot be reduced to the argument that communication is always doomed to failure. And it is only by failing to attend to the silent peculiarity of this art that we could conclude that what was most important to bring to light about persons or poems was their individual "sound" or "feel," their thousandfold particularities and social distinctions, rather than their basis in the truth of one common "thing."
</p>

<p>
An attention to truthfulness, as Oppen's epigraph to this essay suggests, is "far from a social virtue," because Oppen's understanding of the truth of poetry is precisely at odds with any account of virtue that depends on the social determinations of a "form of life". Oppen's lesson to twentieth-century poetry is that a poetry sufficiently abstract to provide social hope will appear to be not just "anti-aesthetic" but altogether anti-phenomenal&#x02014;opposed not just to the idea of literary quality but to the idea of quality itself. Communication may indeed fail: but the curious recognitional fact ("that they are there") is the sort of success made possible by being willing to fail aesthetically, by being silent in the right way.

A case in point is the story of H.H. Lewis as reconstructed in Cary Nelson, <i>Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of Cultural Memory, 1910&#x02013;1945</i> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989). Though Lewis and Oppen are very different poets, there are some parallels between their careers: Lewis, like Oppen, was a committed leftist whose work was extremely well received by William Carlos Williams. Nelson's argument, however, has less to do with the incompatibility of poetry and politics than with the institution of literary criticism privileging a <i>kind </i>of poetry that made Lewis's proletarian and anti-experimental aesthetic invisible.

Properly speaking, the difference between congenital and structural is not just a difference between political economy and philosophy; it is a difference within philosophy as well. It was an exchange between A.J. Ayer and Rush Rhees that first took up Robinson Crusoe as the paradigm of a private language user. As Ayer explains it, the question concerns what we might call a "congenital Crusoe": "Imagine a Robinson Crusoe left alone on his island while still an infant, having not yet learned to speak. Let him, like Romulus and Remus, be nurtured by a wolf, or some other animal, until he can fend for himself; and so let him grow to manhood" . Kripke , as I will shortly explain, intensifies the Crusoe scenario by regarding him not as as the subject of suppositional history but as a structural problem. See A.J. Ayer and Rush Rhees, "Can there be a Private Language?" <i>Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, </i>Supplementary Vol. 28 : 63&#x02013;94, reprinted in George Pitcher, ed., <i>Wittgenstein, The Philosophical Investigations </i>(Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1968), 251&#x02013;285.

There is a non&#x02013;trivial disagreement about whether Kripke's Wittgenstein is a good account of Wittgenstein's "private language argument." Again, for my purposes, what Wittgenstein thought will ultimately be less important than the degree to which the account coincides with what Oppen thought.

Though the definitive version of his interpretation of the Wittgenstein problem was not published until well after the poem appeared, by Kripke's own testimony he had formulated his account as early as 1962 and was lecturing publicly on it by 1964. Although it hardly provides evidence for the influence of Kripke's Wittgenstein, it might nonetheless be worth noting that while the earlier sequence entitled "A Language of New York"  contained a number of the sections that would later be reincorporated into "Of Being Numerous," the Crusoe passage is not one of them.

The history of the statue in question is a fascinating study in the way icons become fodder for ideological conflict. See Vivien Green Fryd<i>, Art and Empire: The Politics of Ethnicity in the US. Capitol, 1815&#x02013;1865</i> (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992): "The United States Capitol dome and its colossal bronze statue are frequently seen on the nightly television news and in political cartoons as signifiers of the U.S. government. Neither photographs of the Capitol nor cartoons, however, provide clear details of the statue on the dome, which is often misidentified in the media and by the general public as an Indian. Thomas Crawford's <i>Statue of Freedom</i> is in fact a difficult monument to discern, in part because of its location, far above the viewer's eye, but also because the artist was forced to make a number of compositional and iconographic changes to satisfy his patron, the U.S. government, represented by two men, Captain Montgomery Meigs (1816&#x02013;1889), from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the financial and engineering supervisor of the Capitol extension between 1853 and 1859, and his boss, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (1808&#x02013;1889). . . . Thomas Crawford allowed his statue to fall victim to southern suppression of potentially threatening symbols. As a result, he created a monument of compromise manifest even in the title; the work is identified by government publications as <i>Statue of Freedom</i> rather than its more appropriate title, 

<b></b>

<i>Armed Liberty</i>. Politics eroded the work's meaning, and, with each concession made by the artist, the work's iconography became more obscured.
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
What is ironic is that during the Civil War Crawford's <i>Statue of Freedom</i> resonated with additional meaning that applied directly to the division between the North and the South. In particular, President Lincoln had the monument hoisted onto the Capitol dome in 1863, to symbolize the nation's reunification under northern hegemony, a meaning that Jefferson Davis, now president of the Confederacy, obviously had never intended."

<p class="noIndent">
In December 1918, Edith S&#x000F6;dergran, a 26-year-old poet living in an isolated village on the Finno-Russian border, wrote an open letter to the readers of <i>Dagens Press</i>, a Swedish-language newspaper in the capital city of Helsinki.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The letter, titled "Individuell Konst" ["Individual Art"], introduced Finland's readers to S&#x000F6;dergran's second volume of poetry, <i>Septemberlyran</i> [<i>The September Lyre</i>].<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  S&#x000F6;dergran believed this collection embodied a new creative spirit that would call forth a new kind of individual into being. Because Finland's readers had had very little exposure to the radical artistic experimentation that had been appearing in Europe's cultural centers for about a decade, S&#x000F6;dergran felt compelled to articulate her vision for this new art in her homeland. She writes in her letter, "Denna bok &#x000E4;r icke avsedd f&#x000F6;r publiken, knappast ens f&#x000F6;r de h&#x000F6;gre intellektuella kretsarna, endast f&#x000F6;r de f&#x000E5; individer som st&#x000E5; n&#x000E4;rmast framtidens gr&#x000E4;ns" [This book is not intended for an audience, barely even for the higher intellectual circles, only for those few individuals who stand closest to the border of the future].<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Her letter issues a challenge to "those few individuals" to engage in acts of self-creation such as those that resulted in the new poems she was laying out before the public.
</p>

<p>
S&#x000F6;dergran's open letter was the only European avant-garde manifesto of its time to be written by a woman.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  It was also the first manifesto in Swedish that heralded an historic break from lyrical convention and the birth of a new, modern poetry.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  However, it has never been recognized as such, probably because it was published in a small-circulation daily in Northern Europe for a limited and culturally conservative audience and signed 

<b></b>

by a single author claiming to represent a new kind of individual rather than a movement with a new set of rules. But her letter's loud and ecstatic tone, its highly stylized language, and its polemical function strongly affiliate it with the artistic manifestos of other European avant-garde movements proliferating in European cultural centers during this decade.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In her letter, S&#x000F6;dergran claims exceptional status for herself and the chosen few who are called to create the new art. She also titles her open letter in order to distinguish the new art she champions. Finally, the letter's poetic language and lofty tones let it stand alone as a self-contained art work and not merely an introductory remark.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  For example, S&#x000F6;dergran writes, "Jag offrar sj&#x000E4;lv varje atom av min kraft f&#x000F6;r mitt h&#x000F6;ga m&#x000E5;l, jag lever helgonets liv, jag f&#x000F6;rdjupar mig i det h&#x000F6;gsta m&#x000E4;nniskoanden frambragt, jag undviker alla inflytelser av l&#x000E4;gre art" [I myself sacrifice every atom of my power for my lofty goal, I live the life of a saint, I steep myself in the highest human spirit created, I shun all influences of a lower species].<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The letter's salvationist and purist lexicon links it semantically with the earlier manifestos of the Futurist movements in Russia and Italy (and S&#x000F6;dergran was, in fact, living in St. Petersburg at the time those manifestos were published). Finally, true to the spirit of contemporary avant-garde movements, S&#x000F6;dergran disparages her poems' aesthetic value, calling them "icke n&#x000E5;got annat &#x000E4;n en intim kladd" [nothing but an intimate scribble]. She writes that her poems' unestimably high value stems instead from their origin; they are "fr&#x000E5;n en individ av en ny art" [from an individual of a new sort]. As manifestos often do, S&#x000F6;dergran's letter ends with an invitation to join the author in her noble quest: "Jag hoppas att jag icke blir ensam med det stora jag har att h&#x000E4;mta" [I hope I will not be alone with the greatness I have to bring].<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Like other European avant-garde poets of this period, S&#x000F6;dergran sought to exemplify her vision for a new art in the poetry she published. But while the artistic production of S&#x000F6;dergran's contemporaries functioned as a vanguard, blazing a path for new modern art forms and quickly fossilizing into literary artifacts, S&#x000F6;dergran's poetry remains a living body of text. Her poems are still in print and are read, admired, and emulated throughout Scandinavia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and much of Eastern Europe.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Accordingly, Scandinavian literary history has cast S&#x000F6;dergran as a pioneer of Modernism in the Swedish lyric rather than as the polemical avant-gardist she also was during her lifetime. In this paper, I will show how S&#x000F6;dergran's particular brand of avant-gardism allowed her poems not only to succeed as an important artistic vanguard in Scandinavia, but also, paradoxically, to ride their own revolutionary wave and enter the canon of modern Scandinavian literature. S&#x000F6;dergran's poetry thus exploits the revolutionary philosophy and function of the artistic avant-garde but resists avant-gardism's historical trajectory, challenging prevailing conceptions of the relationship between avant-gardism and Modernism in European literature.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Swedish was neither a pragmatic nor a self-evident choice of language for S&#x000F6;dergran's avant-garde poetry. S&#x000F6;dergran, who was born to Finland-Swedish immigrants in St. Petersburg and attended a German preparatory school there, was competent in German, Russian, French, and English, as well as her native Swedish. A more pragmatic choice, and one that certainly would have widened her audience, would have been

German, which S&#x000F6;dergran called her best language and the language of her intellect. S&#x000F6;dergran wrote all of her early poems&#x02014;about 200 of them&#x02014;in German, although these poems could not be called avant-garde; they feature perfectly metered verse and end rhymes.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  S&#x000F6;dergran's decision to switch to Swedish for her pioneering poetry likewise has limited her work's circulation among academic and popular audiences in the United States.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  But switching to Swedish was a distinctly avant-gardist decision consistent with S&#x000F6;dergran's vision for her art. She sought to liberate the Swedish soul from the decadence of previous generations and infuse it with a new revolutionary spirit. In a 1920 letter to friend and fellow poet Hagar Olsson, who worked as a critic at <i>Dagens Press</i>, S&#x000F6;dergran writes, "&#x000D6;nskar att du riktigt skulle ut&#x000F6;sa mod&#x000E4;rn lyrik &#x000F6;ver Pressens spalter och detta dumma land" [I wish you really would let loose modern lyrical poetry on the columns of <i>[Dagens] Press </i>and this stupid country.]<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  S&#x000F6;dergran believed that modern lyrical poetry in Swedish was needed in order to give rise to the

creative individuals of the future in her native land, to which she returned when she began publishing her poetry in Swedish in 1916.

<p>
What makes art avant-garde, according to Richard Kostelanetz, is that it challenges established artists' and critics' fundamental understanding of what art is. In his essay "What is Avant-Garde?" Kostelanetz writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Avant-garde art usually offends people, especially serious artists, before it persuades. More precisely, it offends not in terms of subject but as art; most of its audience cannot believe that art is made in this way or are reluctant to accept that perhaps it can be. It strikes most of us as 'wrong' before a few acknowledge it as possibly 'right'; it 'fails' but still <i>works</i>.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
S&#x000F6;dergran's poem "Jag" [I], which appeared in her debut collection of poetry, <i>Dikter </i>[<i>Poems</i>, 1916], demonstrates that she accepted the avant-gardist's role. In this poem, S&#x000F6;dergran anticipates literary society's rejection of the particular creative power she brought to bear. In Swedish lyrical tradition, the first-person pronoun "jag" refers to a poem's speaker, as in "diktens jag" [the poem's speaker]. This poem thus highlights not only the poet-speaker's sense of imprisonment and isolation in her geographical location but also her creative isolation and oppression in a cultural milieu that is hostile to her creative process.

The poem begins:

The speaker is trapped in a land so remote and closed off from the rest of the world that it lies under an "oppressive" sea. Even though it is the land of her birth, the speaker does not belong here. She is "foreign" and "born imprisoned" in a hostile environment. The sun "peeps in" at the speaker "in winding rays," evoking the idea of prison bars as well as the long distance the sun has to travel to get to the speaker. The air "float[ing] between [the speaker's] hands" indicates the futility of the speaker's attempts to connect with her environment. Yet the most important re in this poem is the speaking subject, the poem's "I," to whom all of the other res refer. For example, when the speaker is notified of her lifelong imprisonment&#x02014;"I was told that I was born imprisoned"&#x02014; the passive grammar of the line erases the agency of the one doing the telling and redirects 

<b></b>

this agency to the speaker, who is experiencing the telling. Likewise, the syntax of the following line, "there is no face that would be known to me," implies that it does not matter if faces exist that would be familiar to others; it is the speaker's isolation that is important. Thus the poem recuperates a central position for the creative individual, the "I," despite the speaker's rejection and isolation in the world around her.
</p>

<p>
The poem takes a rhetorical turn in its middle two lines: "Var jag en sten, den man kastat hit p&#x000E5; bottnen? / Var jag en frukt, som var f&#x000F6;r tung f&#x000F6;r sin gren?" [Was I a stone one has thrown here to the bottom? / Was I a fruit that was too heavy for its branch?] The speaker is unsure of the exact form she embodied at her birth&#x02014;stone or fruit&#x02014;but one thing is certain: she is now at "the bottom," where she doesn't belong. The progression of a similar question over two lines&#x02014;"Was I a stone" and "Was I a fruit"&#x02014; suggests that both could be the reason for the speaker's low position. She is thrown to the bottom by those who cast her out, and she also ends up there because the environment in which she lives is not adequate to support the weight of her presence. This imagery contrasts starkly with the lofty and hopeful language of her "Individual Art" manifesto and of many of her subsequent poems. In the poem's final lines, the speaker is still on the ground looking up, unable to resurrect herself physically, but her imagination, embodied in her poetry, takes her aloft to a place where she can search for a home she has never known:

The final image of the speaker "want[ing] to keep a lookout" positions her stuck in her low, underwater prison but imagining and longing for a high place, gazing out upon the world. By creating this poem, the speaker can imagine rising above the present land in which she is a stranger and looking to the land of the future, where she belongs.

The creative individuals with whom S&#x000F6;dergran did feel an affinity were recent and contemporary poets and philosophers from Germany, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As a schoolgirl poet in St. Petersburg, her influences included the poetry of German Romanticists Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Heinrich Heine; the Russian Symbolists Konstantin Balmont and Aleksandr Blok; French Symbolist Arthur Rimbaud; and contemporary German poets Alfred Mombert and Max Dauthendey. After her father died of tuberculosis and S&#x000F6;dergran became ill with the disease at age 16, she underwent extended treatment at a sanatorium in Davos, 

<b></b>

Switzerland, where Nietzsche had earlier penned a substantial portion of <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i> [<i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>]. This work had an immeasurable influence on S&#x000F6;dergran's artistic philosophy and her functional poetics.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The sanatorium's library was well stocked with classics of Western literature, and here S&#x000F6;dergran was exposed to the literary works of William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, and Algernon Charles Swinburne, as well as the philosophies of Nietzsche, Kantian disciple Arthur Schopenhauer, and Austrian theosophist Rudoph Steiner. Following her treatment in Davos, S&#x000F6;dergran returned with her mother in 1916 to their summer villa in Raivola, on the Karelian isthmus joining Finland and Russia. When the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution toppled the tzar, S&#x000F6;dergran and her mother were cut off permanently from their financial resources in St. Petersburg. Finland simultaneously declared its independence from Russia, a move Russia actively resisted for the next two decades. S&#x000F6;dergran and her mother found themselves trapped and isolated in a volatile and geographically disputed region, hungry and penniless, until the poet's death in 1923 at the age of 31. Yet despite her geographical isolation from Europe's artistic and intellectual centers, S&#x000F6;dergran had, throughout her youth, read many of the same writers and thinkers as her avant-gardist peers living in those centers. Philosophically and artistically, she and they worked from similar points of reference.
</p>

<p>
But S&#x000F6;dergran's functional poetics depart significantly from certain features common to European avant-garde poetry from the early twentieth century and demonstrate once again her determination to reconceptualize the function of Swedish lyric for a new age. Features common to much of the avant-garde poetry of Continental Europe during this time were an aggressive and usually masculine poet-speaker; denigrations of literary form, conventions, and the work of predecessors; and the use of neologisms and enigmatic lexicons. While S&#x000F6;dergran employs similar avant-gardist features in her work, she recasts them to serve her individual philosophical agenda. Accordingly, S&#x000F6;dergran's poet-speaker is either feminine or gender-neutral. The speaker's aggression emanates from within rather than strikes out at external targets; it is communicated through the speaker's own intense sexual pleasure and acute physical pain. S&#x000F6;dergran's poetics enjoin destruction and creation in a singular and cyclical process, linking tropes of sexual reproduction with acts of artistic creation. She does not pronounce the death of literary forms but rather seeks to liberate the new poetry from its "mother cell" where it has been gestating. In her "Individual Art" manifesto, she writes, " Jag betraktar det gamla samh&#x000E4;llet som modercellen, som b&#x000F6;r st&#x000F6;djas till dess individerna resa den nya v&#x000E4;rlden" [I regard the old society as a mother cell that should be sustained until the individuals erect the new world].<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Finally, and perhaps most signficantly for her enduring influence, is her remarkably simple poetic lexicon, which seduces readers to engage with a poetics that turns out to be neither simple nor natural by conventional definitions. S&#x000F6;dergran's favored lexicons involve the primordial elements of nature, such as primary colors (especially red, blue, and white), fire, wind, water, sun, stars, and the physical features of the female body, from which all other elements emanate. The female body, then, serves as site and source of creation for the new poetry S&#x000F6;dergran champions.

<p> This strong association of the creative poet-speaker with the physical functions of the female body has particular import for lyrical poetry given its conventional elegiac uses, particularly by a male speaker longing for a lost female beloved. As Teresa Brennan  argues, the symbolic order in which language operates, which makes cognition, articulation, and judgment possible, has been predicated on a "psychical fantasy of woman." Brennan writes: "The idealized woman is the anchor of man's identity and the guarantee of his 'Truth,' the point from which and for which he can reason."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Cynthia Hogue  demonstrates how this historically has operated in the genre of lyrical poetry:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The ideology of gender is inscribed in poetry through such hierarchized images as dominating male/dominated female res. A solitary woman is represented as violable; that is, she is intolerable when she remains independent of the man. He must make his presence<i> felt</i> . . . The poem must replace her, because the poet must prove the durability, the potency, of his word: gender violation slips handily into a trope for the creation of poetry itself.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
In other words, the patriarchal symbolic structures that have for so long framed the cognitive faculties that make poetry possible, simultaneously deny the possibility of a female poet-speaker. S&#x000F6;dergran's call for a new art, then, goes far beyond either form or content. Her poetry calls into question the historical motivations for poetry itself and insists that the truest poetry is individual in the purest sense, i.e., not dependent on exploitative psychical fantasies and structures.
</p>

<p>
S&#x000F6;dergran's location of creative power in the female body is consistent with a central idea of Nietzsche's <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, which arguably had a deeper impact on S&#x000F6;dergran's artistic philosophy and her functional poetics than any other work. Because it is a work of fiction, it is often not as popular among philosophers as others of Nietzsche's writings. But many early twentieth-century avant-gardists, including S&#x000F6;dergran, found Nietzsche's method of using a protagonist-prophet, Zarathustra, to <i>show</i> his ideas through parables and metaphors far more compelling than his other more expository philosophical works. As Bernd Magnus and Kathleen M. Higgins write in their critical summary of this text, one important lesson Zarathustra imparts is the value of anchoring human creative power in the body:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Zarathustra urges that human beings reassess the value of their own bodies, indeed their embodiment. For too long, dreaming of the afterlife, Western humanity has treated the body as a source of sin and error. Zarathustra, in contrast, insists that the body is the ground of all meaning and knowledge, and that health and strength should be recognized and sought as virtues.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Alongside this recuperation of the body, Zarathustra also introduces the idea of the <i>&#x000DC;bermensch,</i> or ultra human being, who rejects complacency and comfort in order to sacrifice all for humanity's advancement. These ideas are central to S&#x000F6;dergran's apprehension of her own role as a creative artist and to the metaphorical content and formal organization of her poems.
</p>

<p>
A good example is S&#x000F6;dergran's poem "Instinkt" ["Intinct"], which appears in her fourth and final volume prior to her death, <i>Framtidens skugga</i> [<i>The Shadow of the Future</i>]. Similarly to "Jag," "Instinkt" is a 13-line, unrhymed, lyrical poem that features a speaker who declares her power to save the world even as her body is decaying and dying:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
Min kropp &#x000E4;r ett mysterium. <br />
S&#x000E5; l&#x000E4;nge detta br&#x000E4;ckliga ting lever <br />
skolen I k&#x000E4;nna dess makt. <br />
Jag skall fr&#x000E4;lsa v&#x000E4;rlden. <br />
[My body is a mystery. <br />
As long as this brittle thing is alive <br />
you will feel its power. <br />
I will save the world.]<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Here the speaker opens with a paradox: her body is in decay, yet it harbors the power to save humanity. S&#x000F6;dergran, who lived in conditions of tremendous chaos, believed 

<b></b>

that such external circumstances are never what defines and delimits a person's creative potential; rather, inner self-doubts do, stemming from our decadent concept of sin. S&#x000F6;dergran thus believed that an individual's primal instinct, located in the body and connected to the earth's origins, is where the power to overcome these limitations lies.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  "I let my instincts build while my intellect watches," S&#x000F6;dergran wrote in an introductory remark to her second collection, <i>Septemberlyran</i>. "My self-confidence comes from the fact that I have discovered my dimensions. It does not behoove me to make myself smaller than I am."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  </p>

In the poem's middle lines, the speaker demonstrates that her confidence stems from an ancient and powerful life force, that of the sexual body:

I know: in this weakened hand lies the fate of the earth.]<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 

<b></b>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The speaker's hand is a metaphor for her ability to write poetry, which S&#x000F6;dergran believed was the antidote to modern humanity's spiritual desolation. But ironically, the speaker's physical weakness increases her creative power; she is able to reconnect with her primal instinct through the bodily experience of acute and prolonged pain. While the poem's English translation makes it appear to retain the classic lyrical "I-You" form of address, the language of the Swedish original demonstrates that the pronouns are not personal but universal. The poem's "I" represents all individuals who use their intellect to serve their creative instincts, embodied in the re of the dying poet. The poem's "you," however, is plural, a detail sometimes lost in translation. (English, for example, uses the same pronoun for both the second-person singular and the second-person plural, while in Swedish there are two distinct sets of pronouns.) Thus the poem's "you" whom the speaker will save are the human masses who lack the poet's creative power. As in most of S&#x000F6;dergran's work, the speaker is female, reflecting S&#x000F6;dergran's consistent ideological and rative conflation of the reproductive capacity of the female sex and the creative power of the female poet. The poem concludes: "It is the power that trembles in my shoe, / it is the power that moves in the folds of my dress, / and it is the power, fearing no abyss, that stands before you." Thus while the poet-speaker's physical body lies weakly on the bed, her instincts stand erect and fearless, creating a powerful poem.
</p>

<p>
In anchoring her subjectivity in a sexual body, S&#x000F6;dergran's language is quite similar to that of a contemporary German expressionist Else Lasker-Sch&#x000FC;ler, whose poetry S&#x000F6;dergran read and admired.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Literary scholars have noted the imprint of Lasker-Sch&#x000FC;ler's poem "Eros" on one of S&#x000F6;dergran's best-known erotic poems, "Dagen Svalnar" [The Day Cools].<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  But one important difference is the role of the object of the female subject's address. In "Eros," the speaker talks <i>about </i>her former lover, not to him:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<p class="noIndent">
Lasker-Sch&#x000FC;ler's speaker anchors her subjectivity in the elegiac form, specifically in the female speaker's ability to feel intense arousal and deprivation simply by conjuring the poetic memory of her lover, who has no materiality in this poem. In so doing, she turns the "psychical fantasy of woman" into a psychical fantasy of man performed by a female poet-speaker.
</p>

<p>
In her poem "Dagen Svalnar," S&#x000F6;dergran reconres the elegiac form to an even greater extent than Lasker-Sch&#x000FC;ler. S&#x000F6;dergran divides her poem into four numbered parts and renegotiates the identity of the male beloved in each part, opening up the possibility that the female speaker may have more than one lover. The materiality of the male beloved(s) ebbs constantly within each part and over the course of the poem: now you see him, now you don't. In the poem's first part, the female speaker establishes her lover's presence, as well as her own dominant subject position, by addressing him in the imperative:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
I. <br />

<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
But in the last three lines of this first stanza, the speaker shifts to the subjunctive tense<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> , indicating that her male beloved is present only in her erotic fantasy:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
In the poem's second stanza, the female speaker seems to establish her lover's presence in the poem by addressing him directly, using the intimate, familiar personal pronoun <i>Du</i>:<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> 
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
II. <br />
Du kastade din k&#x000E4;rleks r&#x000F6;da ros <br />

I do accept the crown you give me, <br />
which bends my head toward my heart.]<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The intimate "you" and deferential "master" of the speaker's address at first seem to indicate not only her lover's material presence, but also her submission to his will, which would be consistent with the symbolic roles afforded male and female res in conventional poetic fantasies. But it quickly becomes apparent that this lover does not have material form either. He is spatially distant and/or absent; he "cast[s]" his red rose rather than hands it to the speaker in a romantic gesture. The female speaker's "white womb" is her pure, reproductive core; it is where her poetry originates, and once it takes material form&#x02014;as the rose in her burning hands&#x02014;it begins to die. Even as the speaker addresses her "master," his "cold eyes" suggest that he, too, is dead, and is present only in spirit to bequeath a crown to his mistress. As the speaker "bends my head toward my heart," she subjugates her intellect, and her language, to the insights of her soul, a poetic manifestation of the process she describes in her introductory remarks to <i>Septemberlyran.</i>
</p>

<p>
A different kind of "master" confronts the speaker in the poem's third part. This master is materially present; he is able to physically touch the female speaker. In stark contrast to the ecstatic tone with which the speaker addresses her lover and her master in the poem's first two parts, here the speaker's tone is filled with dread as she beholds her master. She does not address him directly this time, but rather narrates a traumatic real-time meeting for any witnesses who may be present:

The speaker immediately recognizes her master despite the fact that she has never actually seen him before. Prior to the physical contact that takes place in this stanza, the master has served primarily as a specter haunting the speaker. He is the spectre of death who always has been a familiar possibility but has not made himself felt to this extent previously. He asserts himself aggressively here, grabbing and constricting the speaker's arm that in the previous stanza had held a more benevolent master's rose. Her question, "Where is my ringing maidenly laughter, my womanly freedom with head carried high?" demonstrates that the master's brutal and physical intrusion here threatens to silence the poet-speaker permanently. The speaker's mournful elegy for a parted beloved, then, is for herself: the creative artist.
</p>

<p>
In the poem's final part, the speaker once again addresses her beloved with the intimate <i>Du</i> pronoun, repeating it incrementally to contrast her lover's expectations with his eventual discoveries:
</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The poem concludes, however, not with the speaker's death but with her beloved's misapprehension and rejection of the poet's creative power. The repeated phrase "You sought" evokes the re of the heroic male explorer in search of the new world&#x02014;the new world being, in this case, the elusive ideal woman. The explorer's expectations of what this ideal woman will be like are anchored in a symbolic logic that traces back to Petrarch's longing for his Laura: a woman can never be a poet because she must <i>be</i> the poetry.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The explorer seeks an aestheticized object, not a powerful and creative speaking subject. The "flower" thus represents all conventional poetic res of the female form. A flower, like the idealized woman, is valued for its fragrant beauty when in full bloom, but then it fades and dies. The poet-speaker revises this tired metaphor, appearing to her lover as a fruit (recalling the fruit that was too heavy for its branch in her poem "Jag"). A fruit functions primarily for nourishment, not beauty, and a fruit in the form of a woman evokes the Genesis myth in which the forbidden fruit is a re for divine omniscience. The explorer thus encounters far more than he bargained for in this female subject, and continues his search.
</p>

<p>
The explorer then broadens his concept of the idealized woman to a well. In Swedish, "k&#x000E4;lla" is a natural underground water source that often is a trope for creativity. This seems a far less restrictive metaphor than the flower. But the speaker again revises this metaphor; she is not merely the source, or the muse, of creative power but rather its boundless essence. She presents herself as a sea: a seemingly boundless mass of water upon which the explorer could sail for all his life without grasping the entirety of its geography. This, too, is too much for the explorer and he continues his search&#x02014;this time for "a woman." But the re of a "woman" is too bound up in decadent ideals of beauty and serenity. This re is equally unacceptable to the speaker, who chooses the most abstract of synecdoches to represent herself: "a soul." Tragically, such a re is too vast and enigmatic for the explorer to fathom. The speaker's position in this final stanza is important; she is observing her beloved as he conducts his search&#x02014;the female subject tracking the male explorer. It is she who is narrating his search for the ideal re. Thus ironically, the poem's final line, "You are disappointed," does not express the explorer's disappointment, but the speaker's. She is the one making this statement, and her tone conveys sorrow at his failure to appreciate her vastness and complexity. This is her elegy and the loss is her loss.
</p>

<p>
Alongside S&#x000F6;dergran's radical acts of creation exists a more typically avant-gardist act of destruction in her poetics: that of the traditional re of a woman. In one of S&#x000F6;dergran's most well-known poems, "Vierge Moderne," the speaker destroys the traditional, "virginal," objectified re of woman and erects a radical, "modern," genderless yet highly sexual re in its place. The speaker systematically deconstructs the psychical fantasy of woman by declaring the "modern virgin" to be paradoxical:

Ebba Witt-Brattstr&#x000F6;m, a Swedish scholar who published the first book-length feminist analysis of S&#x000F6;dergran's work in 1997, reads this poem as evidence that S&#x000F6;dergran was actively seeking to destroy the traditional woman re of the collective bourgeois imagination&#x02014;woman as mother, ing&#x000E9;nue, or virgin&#x02014;and erect a re of a New Woman in its place. This project of reinventing Woman, Witt-Brattstr&#x000F6;m argues, was one S&#x000F6;dergran shared with other women writers and theorists of the time, including Ellen Key, Lou Salom&#x000E9;, Anna Akhmatova, and Else Lasker-Sch&#x000FC;ler. Noting S&#x000F6;dergran's frequent use of terms of negation, such as "no woman" in the opening line of this poem, Witt-Brattstr&#x000F6;m writes, "The fact that the New Woman can only be defined in opposition to the old is the explanation for S&#x000F6;dergran's predilection for negations."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  But the negation in the poem's opening declaration opposes the speaker's gendered identity with that of a non-gendered one rather than associating the speaker with a new brand of woman. The affirmed noun, <i>neutrum</i> [neuter], does embody a certain exclusivity, as this word refers to the grammatical gender assigned to a class of nouns comprising roughly twenty-five percent of all Swedish nouns (indicated by the indefinite article <i>ett</i>). <i>Neutrum</i> both is and represents an exclusive and non-gendered gender, ring this poem's subject as paradoxical and defying categorization. The dismissed noun, <i>kvinna</i> [woman], on the other hand, belongs to a class of nouns assigned the <i>utrum</i> [non-neuter] gender, which comprise roughly 75 percent of all Swedish nouns.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  In the poem's opening line, then, the speaker casts off the common gender noun&#x02014;<i>kvinna</i>&#x02014;and steps into a neuter noun&#x02014;<i>neutrum</i>&#x02014;whose gender is rare and oppositional to the normative gender. Consistent with Nietzschean philosophy, S&#x000F6;dergran's poet-subject is destroying herself and recreating herself simultaneously as a rare, oppositional, and paradoxical being.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The other problem with assigning to S&#x000F6;dergran the project of creating a New Woman is that, while she is clearly deconstructing the re of "woman" in this poem, she offers no single alternative vision of what a New Woman would look like. Instead, her ecstatic descriptions mutate rapidly and unpredictably, like the colors and shapes in a kaleidoscope, propelled forward by the momentum of the repeated "I am." By declining to erect a single woman re to replace the one she destroys in the poem's opening line, S&#x000F6;dergran once again stands fast in her subject position by making it impossible to demarcate a representative re to cast in an object position&#x02014;not even a revised, woman-friendly, politically updated object position. S&#x000F6;dergran's move to protect her subject position by resisting codification is a recognition of the fact that a binary opposition to masculinity locks one into the status quo. Instead, Luce Irigaray describes the resistance to being the binary Other through slippery, constant renegotiation in <i>This Sex Which Is Not One</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

'She' is definitely other in herself. This is doubtless why she is said to be whimsical, incomprehensible, agitated, capricious . . . not to mention her language, in which 'she' sets off in all directions leaving 'him' unable to discern the coherence of any meaning. Hers are contradictory words, somewhat mad from the standpoint of reason, inaudible for whoever listens to them with ready-made grids, with a fully elaborated code in hand . . . It is useless, then, to trap women in the exact definition of what they mean, to make them repeat (themselves) so that it will be clear; they are already elsewhere in that discursive machinery where you expected to surprise them.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
S&#x000F6;dergran's choice and arrangement of descriptive symbols in this poem accentuate the fluidity of the re of the "modern virgin." The speaker introduces each line with the words "I am," which evokes the voice of Exodus' God, who identifies himself to a terrified and awestruck Moses in a manner that defies qualification.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Likewise S&#x000F6;dergran's symbols describe the unfathomable: "a child," which is so vague as to defy a specific image; "a page-boy," a re that appears totally out of context in this poem; and "a bold decision," which has no material form. The speaker is both boundary and boundless, a "net" as well as a "laughing streak." The next-to-final line is longer than those preceding it and slows the poem's flow with a caesura and choppy, alliterated speech: "jag &#x000E4;r ett vatten, djupt men dristigt upp till kn&#x000E4;na," [I am a body of water, deep yet bold only to the knees]. This odd image contrasts the strength and power of the drilled "I am" with a qualification: the body of water embodied in the speaker is deep as a re of nature but limited when it takes a human form. The poem's final line is the only one lacking a gendered article after the "I am": "jag &#x000E4;r eld och vatten i &#x000E4;rligt sammanhang p&#x000E5; fria vilkor . . ." [I am fire and water, honestly combined, on free terms . . .]. In this final line, the speaker brings together within herself two primal elements that are usually oppositional and combines them in a spirit of respect and mutuality. <i>Eld</i> (fire) is a non-neuter noun, and <i>vatten</i> (water) is a neuter noun, but the fact that they signify non-quantifiable elements in this context eliminates the need for quantifying, gendered articles. This represents for S&#x000F6;dergran an ideal state of being: no Man, no Woman&#x02014;only free, borderless, primal existence as a creating human subject in the Nietzschean sense.

S&#x000F6;dergran's poet-speaker clearly was too "great" for contemporary readers in provincial Finland. Hagar Oisson, initially the sole writer and critic to give S&#x000F6;dergran's second poetry collection <i>Septemberlyran </i>a favorable review, wrote decades later about the public response to S&#x000F6;dergran's "Individual Art" manifesto:

The publication of S&#x000F6;dergran's manifesto in <i>Dagens Press</i> provoked scorn from high-profile cultural journalists and literary critics in Finland's capital who could not stand such lofty, self-important tones emanating from a little-known female poet. For example, a well-known columnist for <i>Hufvudstadsbladet</i>, the leading Swedish-language daily, published a column the day after S&#x000F6;dergran's open letter in which he "confesses his sincere loathing for 'Nietzsche-crazed womenfolk' but would nonetheless arm himself with 'his strongest spiritual binoculars' in order to see a glimmer of the poetess' glory."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Other columnists quickly followed suit, and soon readers chimed in, one even placing an advertisement to sell his copy of <i>Septemberlyran</i> at a discount. Even fellow poets who wrote in to the newspapers to defend S&#x000F6;dergran against such assault acknowledged in apologist tones that S&#x000F6;dergran's actions reflected a certain "naivet&#x000E9;"&#x02014;a patriarchal term that evoked her youth and gender in order to compensate for her audaciouness. The Finnish public believed they knew what real Swedish lyric was: it was the work of Finland's "national" poet, the nineteenth-century Finland-Swede J. L. Runeberg. His Romantic verse had won international acclaim, earned comparisons with Shelley and Keats, and fueled the cause of Finnish nationalism. Runeberg's poetry was particularly effective in expressing the Finnish soul through images of its natural landscape. Another world-class Finland-Swedish artist from the nineteenth century, the composer Jean Sibelius, set much of Runeberg's poetry to music, increasing its appeal and solidifying its claim as Finland's "true" lyrical poetry against which all else must be measured.
</p>

<p>
S&#x000F6;dergran recast such natural imagery in a linguistically simple yet philosophically complex poetics that celebrated individual creative power rather than collective national identity, engendering outrage among the cultural establishment. During her lifetime, her defenders consisted primarily of two people: the writer and critic Hagar Olsson and the bilingual Finland-Swedish avant-garde poet Elmer Diktonius, who was younger than S&#x000F6;dergran and inspired by her work<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> . It was not until two decades after her death, following the Second World War, that Scandinavian critics and scholars began to recognize her indelible impact on the lyrical poetry of subsequent generations of world-class Swedish-language poets, including the Swedish surrealist Gunnar Ekel&#x000F6;f, the Nobel Prize-winning poet Harry Martinson, and multiple Nobel nominee Tomas Transtr&#x000F6;mer, who also is the only Swedish poet consistently taught in American creative writing programs. Feminist scholars who have entered the Scandinavian Academe since the 1960s have demanded a critical reassessment of her work, resulting in a number of book-length scholarly treatments of S&#x000F6;dergran's work, mostly in Swedish, over the 

<b></b>

past three decades.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  This paper is a step toward bringing this important poet, whose work functionally and philosophically spans our conventional categories of Modernism and avant-garde, into the American Academe. If the true nature of art is defined and contested by its margins, then it is important to consider the work of avant-gardists from so-called "minor" literatures in order to reach a greater understanding of avant-gardism's role in literary and cultural production.

In 1916, Swedish was still the dominant language of education, literature, and culture in Finland, even though native Swedish speakers comprised only 13 percent of Finland's population. The linguistic dominance of Swedish was the result of Finland's 700-year colonial history with the Kingdom of Sweden, which ended in 1809 when Finland became a Grand Duchy of Tzarist Russia. Accordingly, all educated Finns were accustomed to reading their national literature in Swedish despite the fact that Swedish is a Scandinavian and Indo-European language and Finnish, in contrast, stems from the Finno-Ugric language family. Folklorist Elias L&#x000F6;nnrot had published the<i> Kalevala</i>, Finland's national folk epic and the first major work of literature in Finnish, in 1835, fueling a Finnish nationalist movement that resulted in the formation of a Finnish Literature Society and the first Finnish-language schools by the late nineteenth century. Nonetheless, Finnish did not become the dominant literary language in Finland until after the Second World War. Today, the country is officially bilingual, with both Finnish and Swedish required in primary schools, government, and civil service occupations.

The other notable avant-garde manifestos written by women during this period were by Americans: Mina Loy, who wrote "Feminist Manifesto" in 1914, and Gertrude Stein, who wrote "Composition as Explanation" in 1926. Although S&#x000F6;dergran does not call her open letter a manifesto per se, the form and content of her open letter, as well as the particular historical moment of its publication, place it within this genre. Suleiman  breaks down the historically recognizable components of a manifesto in describing H&#x000E9;l&#x000E8;ne Cixous' "Le Rire de la M&#x000E9;duse" ["The Medusa's Laugh"], written in 1975. These components include the following: "It is written by an 'I' who represents a group ('we,' in this case women); it alternates in tone between the aggressive (when addressing the hostile 'straight' reader) and the hortatory (when addressing the other members of the group), and it suggests a program that implies both a revolutionary practice of writing and the disruption of existing cultural and social institutions and ideologies" . While S&#x000F6;dergran's tone in her manifesto is not as combative as Cixous' or as that of her male contemporaries, it is unquestionably discriminatory, differentiating between those "few individuals who stand closest to the border of the future" and as such fits the genre Suleiman aptly describes.

In <i>The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics</i>, scholars Sverre Lyngstad and Lars Warme claim manifesto status for an earlier essay, "Ordkonst och bildkonst" ["Verbal and Pictoral Art," 1913], by the canonical Swedish Modernist P&#x000E4;r Lagerkvist, claiming that he "anticipat[ed] the Swedo-Finnish Modernists" . While I agree that Lagerkvist's essay is an important seminal work of Swedish Modernism, I do not believe it satisfies the formal, ideological, or functional requirements of the avant-garde manifesto. His was a theoretical essay that rejected literary naturalism, the prevailing style, in favor of the simplicity and purity of expression found in classical works of literature, such as Greek tragedy, the Old Testament, and Icelandic Sagas. He, like many Swedish Modernists, admired the work of the southern Swedish poet Vilhelm Ekelund, who in 1902 had been the first Swedish poet to write in free verse and who drew his inspiration from classical literary texts. In addition,

<b></b>

Lagerkvist's first poetry collection that was considered a true Modernist breakthrough, <i>&#x000C5;ngest</i> [<i>Anguish</i>, 1916] was not published until three years later and thus did not function in a dialectic with a free-standing manifesto that sought to exemplify similar artistic ideals in a different form. While early twentieth-century avant-gardists did seek converts, their manifestos were enigmatic, flamboyant and provocative, and Lagerkvist employed the more conventional rhetorical speech of an argumentative essay in both his 1913 work and in several subsequent essays. Thus according to the criteria I have outlined here, S&#x000F6;dergran's open letter satisfies the requirements of an avant-gardist manifesto while Lagerkvist's essay does not.

S&#x000F6;dergran's readership in Eastern Europe can likely be attributed at least in part to the Swedish government's concerted efforts to promote Swedish language and culture in Eastern European educational systems since the opening up of that region in the late 1980s. Because S&#x000F6;dergran wrote in Swedish, her work has an honored place in the literary canon of Sweden as well as her native Finland.

"Avant-garde" here is a specific term I use to describe artists who cast themselves as historical res concerned with "discovery and self-transcendence" as opposed to arbiters of fashion or taste (see Kostelanetz 1982). I differentiate this term from Modernist art in two senses. "Avant-garde," drawing from its original (French) militaristic connotation as the vanguard of an advancing army, evokes in this context an artistic vanguard, i.e. the aggressive forerunners who announce the death of old, decadent art forms and the coming of new ones. Their semantics and their forms tend to be more aggressive than that of so-called Modernist and Postmodernist artists. Avant-gardists' historical function is cyclical: their art appears at those moments when contemporary art becomes decadent in order to blaze a path for a new and more advanced art, such as so-called Modernist and Postmodernist art. My claim is that S&#x000F6;dergran's poetry paradoxically has functioned both aggressively, as avant-garde art, and perpetually, as canonical Modernist art and popular poetry in Scandinavia.

In a March 9, 1920 letter to Olsson, who had sent her excerpts from the German expressionist's poetry, S&#x000F6;dergran writes: "Else Lasker-Sch. &#x000E4;r ju &#x000F6;verjordiskt h&#x000E4;rlig, det var d&#x000E5; endast hennes tidigare diktning jag k&#x000E4;nde" [Else Lasker-Sch. is of course divinely magnificent, I had only been familiar with her earlier poetry].

Both Diktonius, who was four years younger than S&#x000F6;dergran, and Olsson were active in contributing to the short-lived Finland-Swedish avant-garde journal <i>Ultra</i>, which began in 1922, a year before S&#x000F6;dergran's death, and ceased publishing that same year. Its successor, a radical cultural journal called <i>Quosego</i>, published from 1928&#x02013;29 in Swedish-Finland and demonstrated more success in championing the cause of artistic and linguistic innovation.

<p class="noIndent">
From the early 1920s when Benito Mussolini first came to power through the end of the first decade of the fascist rule, Margherita Sarfatti played a dominant role in the formulation of a new variety of Italian cultural nationalism. A cultural advisor, art critic, socialist turned fascist, and Mussolini's lover, she both directly and indirectly shaped the cultural policies of the Italian regime. As Victoria de Grazia suggests, Sarfatti "wielded immense personal power through her capacity to bring together intellectuals, artists, and the political personnel of the regime." Over time, she "manipulated the regime's burgeoning patronage networks to promote the <i>Novecento</i> as a 'national school,'" helped to found the review <i>Gerarchia,</i> largely created the public image of the Mussolini in her authorized biography <i>Dux</i> , and "reigned, doyenne of official intellectual life."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In their biography of Sarfatti, Philip V. Cannistraro, and Brian R. Sullivan have argued that "Margherita had brought a degree of cultural respectability to a movement that otherwise appeared to be nothing more than a gang of violent, anti-intellectual thugs."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Nancy Harrowitz has addressed Sarfatti's complicated identity as a Jewish woman (she later converted to Catholicism) involved in a largely masculinist and later anti-Jewish regime. Sarfatti, she writes, "was to a great degree the author of fascism itself and thus also the author of those conditions which produced such profound identity shifts within herself."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Despite her importance to this period of cultural history, however, Sarfatti's writings remain unavailable in English translation: a situation that the present dossier sets out to remedy in the form of a brief but representative sampling of her early writings on art for Mussolini's newspaper <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i>.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Margherita Grassini Sarfatti was born in Venice in April 1880 to wealthy, unassimilated Jewish parents. Thanks to her private teachers Pietro Orsi, Pompeo Molmenti, and Antonio Fradeletto, whose careers combined investment in art with political engagement, her education included significant exposure to art and art criticism. Despite her parents' social position, she became a committed socialist early on, in 1898 marrying the socialist lawyer Cesare Sarfatti, the member of another prosperous Venetian family. The Sarfattis moved to Milan in 1902, and about this time Margherita began her career as an art critic. In 1903, she was awarded a prize for her articles on the Fifth Venice Biennale, published in <i>Gazzetta degli Artisti </i>(Venice) and <i>La Patria </i>(Rome). From 1903 to 1908, Margherita contributed art criticism to such periodicals as <i>Avanti! </i>(Milan), <i>Avanti della Domenica </i>(Florence then Rome)<i>, L'Adriatico</i> (Ancona), <i>Varietas</i> (Milan), and the <i>Gazzetta di Venezia, </i>securing a regular post at the socialist daily <i>Avanti!</i> in 1908.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  These early years demonstrate the extent to which her thinking about art was from the beginning intertwined with her ideas about politics and social change.
</p>

<p>
Sarfatti's influence in the art world was greatly aided by her political and amorous involvement with Benito Mussolini. Mussolini was a rising star in the socialist party, and in December 1912, he took over the editorship of <i>Avanti!</i> This was the period in which Sarfatti first cemented her ties to the avant-gardes, and such res as Achille Funi, Leonardo Dudreville, Carlo Erba, and Antonio Sant'Elia became frequent guests of her salon.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Although they still identified themselves with futurism, Sarfatti saw in them the beginnings of a calmer classicizing trend in the modern movement. In 1914, she reviewed their "New Tendencies" exhibition for <i>Avanti!</i>, celebrating the work of Funi and Dudreville in a review that marks a transition in her career from being a mere observer of the art world to that of advocate and promoter.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As the political situation shifted&#x02014;in Italy in general, and in the socialist party in particular&#x02014;Sarfatti gained additional clout. In October 1914, Mussolini broke with the socialist party over the question of Italian neutrality in World War I: although the socialists opposed the war, he believed Italy should intervene. Sarfatti, too, jumped ship in the summer of 1915 and started publishing articles about contemporary art in <i>Il Popolo d'Italia,</i> the newspaper Mussolini founded in the immediate wake of his break with socialism. Her friendship with Mussolini intensified, and although their affair was on-again-off-again for many years, it grew more serious in the fall of 1918, at which time she became his principal advisor on cultural matters. The collaboration was cemented because Sarfatti's cultural objectives converged with Mussolini's political goals: he was committed to restoring social and economic order in Italy in the name of modernization; she sought to establish a school of artists whose work was at once modern and classicizing, invested in innovation and committed to a "return to order."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
By this time, both as a response to the war and to the rative turn marked by the work of Metaphysical school painters like Giorgio de Chirico, artists like Gino Severini, Mario Sironi, and Carlo Carr&#x000E0; were also drifting out of the futurist fold. They were gravitating towards various forms of modernist classicism, seeking to innovate through the modeling of simple forms and drawing their inspiration from early Renaissance artists such as Masaccio. Sarfatti was one of the catalysts of this classicizing turn and 

<b></b>

dreamed of a "second Italian Renaissance that would restore the supremacy of her nation's art and return the center of the art world from France to Italy." With Mussolini she co-edited <i>Ardita</i> (1919&#x02013;1921), conceived as the literary review of <i>Il Popolo d'Italia,</i> and later <i>Gerarchia </i>(1922&#x02013;1943).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  And during the early years of his regime, Sarfatti took an active role in educating Mussolini about the role that art could play in his vision of a politically revitalized Italy, encouraging him to study Machiavelli and the history of ancient Rome.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>
This new advocacy role thrust her into the world of public relations and patronage battles. In the spring of 1920, she fought successfully to gain entry for Achille Funi, Mario Sironi, and other modern Italian painters into the twelfth Venice Biennale, protesting their exclusion from the exhibition. From its foundation in 1895 until the mid-1920s, the Biennale had been a conservative affair; by 1914, it had become "a confirmed stop on the grand tours of an increasingly mobile bourgeoisie." In the early 1920s, Vittorio Pica brought modern European art&#x02014;especially French Post-Impressionist art&#x02014;into the Biennale, but the Italian artists represented remained conservative, academic painters

<b></b>

such as Ettore Tito, Telemaco Signorini, and Pietro Fragiacomo. To add insult to injury, during the first thirty or so years of the Biennali, there were nearly two foreign artists for every Italian artist.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Sarfatti's attempt to introduce modern Italian art into the Biennale succeeded: Pica offered exhibition space to a number of the artists she had championed.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  In this way Sarfatti became identified with a group of artists who soon came to call themselves the <i>Novecento italiano</i>. The name echoed art historians' use of the term <i>quattrocento</i> to describe such artists as Piero della Francesca, Paolo Uccello, and Masaccio. The painters of the <i>Novecento</i> sought a distinctly Italian and Mediterranean road to modernity: one that embraced the new but animated by the same interplays of elementary forms and volumes found in early Renaissance masters. While Sarfatti did not tell them what direction to take in their art, she helped to shape the movement's identity.
</p>

<p>
After Mussolini assumed power in October 1922, Sarfatti brought additional attention to the <i>Novecento</i> by inviting Mussolini to speak at the openings of the group's exhibitions. At its first exhibition, in March 1923, Mussolini spoke of the interrelation between the art of politics and the politics of art. "I too am an artist," he declared, "who works a certain material and pursues certain determined ideals." He explained the state's responsibility to artists: "The state has a single duty: that is to not sabotage art, to create conditions humane to artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national points of view."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Some of the <i>Novecentisti </i>worried about the implications of Sarfatti's ties to Mussolini, as they did not want to be perceived as working openly for the fascist regime. Though Sarfatti would later reply that "fascist art" was not a product of the regime, but rather that "fascism and this form of art are born of a single rootstock," tensions mounted about who was in charge of the movement.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  By April 1924, the first incarnation of the <i>Novecento</i> collapsed as a result of the resignation of four members, including Leonardo Dudreville, Anselmo Bucci, and Gian Emilio Malerba.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Over time, however, these artists came to appreciate the value of Sarfatti's support and the <i>Novecento Italiano</i> was reborn in February 1925, at the instigation of Achille Funi. The new group included such prior members as Anselmo Bucci, Leonardo Dudreville, and Mario Sironi, but added to their ranks Carlo Carr&#x000E0;, Alberto Salietti, Arturo Tosi, and Adolfo Wildt. It mounted an exhibition at the Palazzo della Permanente in Milan from February to March 1926, and the participants' work showed a much greater stylistic range than had the original <i>Novecento</i> group. In addition to the <i>Novecentisti,</i> there were representatives of the Roman <i>Scuola Romana</i> (including Carlo Socrate and Primo Sinopico), second generation futurists (Fortunato Depero, Enrico Prampolini, and Luigi Russolo), representatives of the Florentine <i>strapaese</i> group (Ardengo Soffici, Libero Andreotti, Antonio Maraini), and artists no longer strictly affiliated with particular currents (such as Giorgio de Chirico, Giorgio Morandi, Cipriano Efisio Oppo, Gino Severini).<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  This rebirth of the <i>Novecento</i> marked the beginning of Sarfatti's period of greatest cultural influence.
</p>

<p>
In 1925, the first edition of Sarfatti's biography, <i>The Life of Benito Mussolini</i>, was published in England. In June 1926, the Italian edition was published under the title <i>Dux,</i> the Latin form of <i>Duce</i>: a title that linked the cult of Mussolini to that of <i>romanit&#x000E0;</i> 

<b></b>

("romanness") in line with Sarfatti's and Mussolini's dream of remaking Rome "into the political and spiritual capital of a new fascist empire."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Sarfatti's husband Cesare died in 1924, and after spending much of 1926 in Rome, Sarfatti moved to the nation's capital in 1927, her proximity to Mussolini further strengthening her power and consecrating her policymaking role.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Sarfatti also encouraged Mussolini to found institutions to rejuvenate Italian culture. In 1926, he created the Royal Academy of Italy, and Sarfatti was widely thought to have chosen the first members.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Mussolini declared that the Academy would be "a vibrant center of national culture that augments and promotes the intellectual movement according to the genius and tradition of our people."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Members of the Academy included prominent res in the arts, humanities, and sciences, including Giovanni Gentile, Luigi Pirandello, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Guglielmo Marconi, Ottorino Respighi, and Enrico Fermi. They "received a stipend of 3,000 lire a month, three times the average shopkeeper's salary" and "[i]n exchange for subsidy, the regime required members to appear at public ceremonies wearing ornate fascist uniforms."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The Academy's activities included financing an attempt to rid the Italian language of foreign borrowing, establishing a State Record Library (<i>Discoteca dello Stato</i>) to preserve regional dialects and traditional songs, sponsoring conferences that drew important cultural personalities to Italy, and supporting revivals of the decorative arts. Its most important contributions to cultural production, however, were probably the grants and awards it sponsored, including the prestigious Mussolini Prize (<i>Premio Mussolini</i>). Recipients of this prize include Ada Negri and Emilio Cecchi; others, including Mario Mafai, Anna Maria Ortese, and Elio Vittorini received smaller "encouragement prizes" (<i>premi d'incoraggiamento</i>).
</p>

<p>
Over time, Sarfatti's ability to influence government policies and patronage practices diminished. In part, this came about due to personal jealousies within Mussolini's inner circle; in part, due to increasing concerns within certain conservative sectors of the fascist party regarding foreign and Jewish influence. Much of the art she advocated&#x02014;including the <i>Novecento</i> and Rationalism&#x02014;professed the value of <i>italianit&#x000E0; </i>("Italianness") but also identified itself with broader international currents, thereby drawing the wrath of ultranationalists. That Sarfatti was born a Jew was also a problem, though more often an unspoken than a spoken one given fascism's early rejection of anti-Semitism. Starting in the late 1920s, however, a small but increasingly influential segment of the regime and party began to invoke Judaism as a threat to Italian national identity. Although Sarfatti had converted to Catholicism in 1928, her Jewishness was still exploited by her opponents as a quick means of dismissal.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  And in January 1930, Mussolini's wife Rachele demanded that he end his affair with Sarfatti and that <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i> cease publishing her work, and he gradually acquiesced. The government's official cultural policies remained pluralistic in character, and even though the proponents of modernism won numerous victories, nativist voices were growing influential. As the 1930s progressed and Italy's partnership with Germany led to a series of steps culminating in the promulgation of Nazi-style racial laws in 1938, Sarfatti recognized that she must flee her homeland. She began to spend extended periods abroad, working for the Hearst 

<b></b>

newspapers in the US in the mid-1930s. On November 14, 1938, she departed Italy once and for all, without encountering any obstructions. Even if she exerted little influence over the fascist regime during its final decade, Sarfatti had left such an indelible mark that some would remember her as Mussolini's "dictator of culture."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This selection of pieces from <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i> follows the evolution of Sarfatti's thought between 1919 and 1926. The first is an abridged version of a three-part review of the Great National Futurist Exhibition, organized by Marinetti and held at the Central Gallery of Art in Milan from March 11&#x02013;April 30, 1919. It points out how the show actually marks a departure from futurism, and observes how artists like Sironi and Funi were working to restore "plastic values" to art, looking to an earlier period in which painting had been integral to architecture.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The second piece, published in February 1920, bemoans the lack of representation of members of the Italian avant-gardes at the 12th Venice Biennale. Because Sarfatti had begun her career writing about this international exhibition, the Biennale became the focal point of her critique of a contemporary arts scene on which modern Italian painting was neglected, while artists from across the Alps were granted prominence. This polemic represents the beginning of her successful campaign to bring recognition to the artistic and cultural innovations taking place in contemporary Italian art.
</p>

<p>
The third piece, published in April 1921, celebrates an exhibition of Italian paintings in Berlin, seizing the opportunity to call for a new art at once modern and rooted in Italian artistic tradition. The artists it embraces had rejected futurism's advocacy of a complete break with the past, choosing instead to look back to <i>quattrocento</i> art in the pursuit of a sober and elementary forms of ration. In so doing, their work resonated with Mussolini's general conviction that Italy's cultural heritage should provide the main basis for new artistic creation.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The fourth piece concerns the foundation of the Italian Royal Academy, formalized by a decree passed on January 7, 1926. Sarfatti's account of this institution's mission demonstrates the extent to which she believed in the state's responsibility to enrich the nation's culture through the sponsorship of artists, intellectuals, and scientists.
</p>

<p>
The values that Sarfatti championed in her essay on the April 1921 Berlin show provided the aesthetic grounds for the <i>Novecento</i> <i>italiano</i>, and her review of the latter's March 1926 exhibition is the fifth and final piece in this anthology. Richly illustrated, it was published in <i>La Rivista Illustrata di Il Popolo d'Italia,</i> a monthly supplement to the newspaper. It represents Sarfatti's most comprehensive account of this important show.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There are many strands of Sarfatti's work that are barely touched upon here. There is no trace of her contribution to building up the myth of Mussolini as <i>il Duce</i>. Nor are there indications of her frequent attention to the role of women in modern life. What these five pieces document, however, is Sarfatti's sustained effort to define modern Italy as a cultural nation.

I. Concerning Some General Principles (April 4, 1919)
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p class="noIndent">
First, art is not the reproduction of reality. Painting has nothing to do with photography.
</p>

<p>
These are commonplace, obvious truths, and in stating them one risks making a pitiful show of oneself in front of individuals of less than mediocre intelligence. But if we analyze how most of them understand these principles, we notice at once that the essential core of these so-called truisms is a truth still hard to grasp for the common mind.
</p>

<p>
Compromise has always pleased the public.
</p>

<p>
Water tends naturally to run downhill; and the human mind, just as naturally, follows the same law of minimal effort. But, by fortunate contradiction, there is also a child in us who is eager to see the newest thing, to play with an unfamiliar toy. Men thus express great gratitude to whoever presents them with what is already seen and known, seasoned with a savvy, pleasing dose of obvious and superficial novelty. The mind exerts no effort to acclimate itself to an essentially familiar environment, while the eye is delighted by the distraction of a brilliant new thing that proves quickly accessible and readily assimilable. In painting and, more generally, in the plastic arts, commercial success has been achieved by those who know how to reproduce the common features of reality with an illusionism that only slightly and superficially diverges from photography, especially by softening a re and smoothing distinctive angles and harsh edges.
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
On the contrary, the avant-garde painting and sculpture of today doesn't even bother to reproduce a man, woman, watermelon, or dog in the rigid photographic manner of ordinary vision. Hence the anger of the public: a revolt founded upon mental sluggishness and deep disorientation.
</p>

<p>
Why might this be?
</p>

<p>
Painting and sculpture were the handmaidens of a greater unifying art throughout the solemn centuries of austere unity and hierarchy that were the Middle Ages and throughout all previous centuries: namely, architecture. At a certain inevitable point, the architectural tree was destined to blossom with more graceful, subtle, and fragile plastic rations: the architrave, the metope, the capital, the spire, bas-relief garlands. Sharpened and glorified, these ornaments culminated in statues.
</p>

<p>
Painting&#x02014;frescos, mosaics, altarpieces&#x02014;came to inscribe itself in the flat spaces and to reveal its significance and value in rhythmic lines and luminous colors.
</p>

<p>
What did the overly-praised Renaissance do? It set canvases standing on solitary easels. Worse still, it uprooted statues from their necessary and logical architectural setting.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The disciplines of painting and sculpture developed over too many centuries and millennia for grace to abandon them all at once. Architectural and exterior stylistic needs continued to leave a rhythmic mark on their inner architecture: consciously so in great works; unconsciously so in minor counterparts. But during this long era of anarchic wandering, little by little, the sense and synthesis of stylistic logic became obscured and obliterated.
</p>

<p>
As always, when substance runs short, it is replaced by sticking blindly and fanatically to formulae. Ritual and superstition are born out of destiny's rubble and ashes.
</p>

<p>
So developed the academicism and the rigid schematics of neo-classicism. And, as a reaction, came the Romanticism of Delacroix and the realism of Courbet, to sweep clean the terrain. They flowed as a river does toward its mouth, into the magnificent anarchic impetuosity of impressionism and post-impressionism.
</p>

<p>
With post-impressionism (Seurat, Signac, Pissarro), the process of fragmentation and molecular decomposition to which the great constructive unity of painting was subjected reached its apex, resulting in the breakdown of surface colored planes into splintered rainbow shards with the stroke of a Divisionist brush.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Analysis in painting has already produced everything that could be expected.
</p>

<p>
With Paul C&#x000E9;zanne, not by chance a Frenchman of Italian origin, begins the age and the classical task of undertaking a great synthetic reconstruction.
</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="noIndent">
There is still plenty of confusion and chaos, plenty of hasty mucking up of commonly accepted notions regarding art. Among artists themselves (those who have ideas) and even among avant-garde painters, there are many who in their efforts to define this movement still struggle to understand their own aims. Perhaps more than a few of them believe that they inhabit a realm of unbridled and unprecedented individual freedom. And perhaps they are offended to be assigned to a "school": a label that smacks of reproach and suggests a lesser reputation.
</p>

<p>
They are mistaken. "School" does not mean the elimination of individual artistic personality. Those endowed with more intelligence and more subtle and robust sensitivity emerge, and will always emerge, from the pack. But it does mean coordination and collaborative effort.
</p>

<p>
The lyrical composition and decomposition of form, which these avant-gardist tendencies champion, may also mislead them. In reality, these formal operations are permissible only so long as, serving the higher interests of art, they become the necessary components of a more solemn recovery of uniform synthesis.
</p>

<p>
These laws of balance and proportion, these secrets of stylistic composition by means of which individual talent flowers and grafts itself upon the musical and geometrical rhythms of profound and spontaneous destiny in diverse forms and for diverse reasons: all the great epochs knew this secret of the grand style. We now stand on the verge of a radical revision of artistic values. So the challenge faced in today's fervid vigil is to 

<b></b>

rediscover this secret according to the intimate and essential laws of internal development, not according to the external contours of a nonexistent architecture that is still in swaddling clothes.
</p>

<p>
The duty of the Italian art of today and tomorrow will perhaps be that of rising to this task, successfully carrying out this mission.

II. Concerning Some Painters (April 10, 1919)
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p>
Funi, Sironi, Russolo, Dudreville&#x02014;all are painters already known to the public&#x02014;and, among the younger and still unknown, Baldassari, Rosai, Primo Conti; and the witty and amusing decorator Depero; as well as a sculptor of unexpected grace like Palafacchina: how many exhibitions have taken place in Milan or, for that matter, in Italy, that bring together such an abundance of serious and authentic artistic authorities?<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The public does well to swarm about the exhibition every day. Not everyone understands, but many discuss and some reflect. It is quite something.
</p>

<p>
I am not referring to pseudo-intellectual connoisseurs, brimming over with cultural foolishness, but rather to the arrogant experts who holler despite the total lack of understanding of the plastic arts, their form, style, or time period. I speak for the genuine public, free from pretexts and preconceptions, which attends the exhibition in order to make an honest effort to understand. This public might well be more able to grasp the intimate substance of the artworks exhibited if it could be persuaded that there is no need for wholesale acceptance of all of futurism.
</p>

<p>
The "puzzle alphabets" [<i>alfabeti a sorpresa</i>], for example, are considered an ingenious and amusing variation of the <i>rebuses</i> and anagrams already in vogue in the venerable puzzle magazines.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The <i>Portrait of the Marchesa Casati</i> by Giacomo Balla&#x02014;amusing and extremely faithful as a portrait with its complicated structures of wood, glass, and sparkling tinfoil&#x02014;represents little more than the elaboration of an ephemeral, elegant, and ingenious toy: an artistic plaything, if you wish, but without the construction of a work of art.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
To claim that every one of the thirty plus artists in this exhibition of Italian avant-garde painting was an exceptional talent would be misleading. Some of them are. Better (because more serious and honest) to acknowledge that not all the works of even the best artists are completely successful. Even the most seasoned painter-cooks [<i>pittori-cuochi</i>] are not always skilful in varying the unpublished recipes they prepare for the public. Sometimes they stumble along even well-trodden paths. The risk is greatest for the courageous explorers of unfamiliar paths, for those who seek out traces of ancient forgotten streets or try to pry open new passages toward horizons of unfamiliar sensitivity. But for them, unlike the exploiters of tried and true formulas, some fertile leads may result in the process (even by dint of error). Glory may well be achieved even through failure. 

<b></b>

</p>

<div class="center">

<p class="noIndent">
Why then insist on the fate and name of an exhibitor who brings the mild fanaticism of his own mediocrity to art or who is filled with good will, at once obstinate and disparate, or gives evidence of a disinterested and respectable but unfortunate love of painting?
</p>

<p>
Funi, Russolo, Dudreville, Sironi: these four well deserve to have people lingering before their art works, together with the other two or three already named. (One might perhaps add the names of Giudici, Lega, Venna, and other younger men to the list, if only they could be judged on the basis of more or more substantial works.)<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Asia is very present in the chromatic schemes and assemblages of the set painter Fortunato Depero: the Asia of Persian and Chinese miniatures interpreted through the Russia of L&#x000E9;on Bakst and the ballets of Diaghilev, and especially through the corpulent and gargantuan burst of Mikhail Larionov's mock-heroic laughter. There is a little of Adolphe Sturzwage's dissective cubism in his compositions, a bit of Larionov, again, and a bit of Sironi in his conception of the human form, squared off in great masses and geometric planes.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  I prefer his little drawings in black and white, where he reveals, especially in the representations of animals, a solid sense of mass, and a purity of line in the manner of Pisanello.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
An interior nocturnal scene in a tavern or an elegant night club also succeed in being pleasant and tasteful, decorated with the tumultuous and not discordant uproar of the flat hues and lively colors of which he is fond, done deliberately to prompt a desire for the distractions and fleeting gaiety and forgetfulness of the moment.
</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Let's be clear: the true colorist doesn't cling to and accumulate colors in the name of a sort of orgiastic, Dionysian insatiability. Rather, the profound colorist is an Apollonian for whom, for example, a chord of grays, broken and exalted by sobbing improvised reds or by a serene glitter of blues is enough to provoke and satisfy vibrations of intense voluptuousness.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In this refined and authentic sense, Sironi is a formidable colorist. The quality of his grays is an acute innovation, delicate and balanced in tonal values, which I would not hesitate to define as classical. (Do you recall the intoxicating sobriety of the intense coloration in Raphael's <i>Transration</i>?)
</p>

<p>
Let's take the case of Sironi's <i>Group of Houses&#x02014;Night,</i> and his <i>Dancer</i>, and <i>Lady in the Rain</i>. It is difficult to explain in words the nostalgic preciousness and precise harmony of the moderate golden tones, of the shadows, and the cool whites and blacks. He knows how to juggle these elements without affectation or mannerism, placing special emphasis on the contrast between the delicacy of color and a powerful sense of force, verging on brutality, in the treatment of form.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Here are the sketches for <i>Il Montello,</i> newspaper of the trenches, with such audacious elasticity of spirit, founded and directed by Massimo Bontempelli:<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  <i>Guglielmone on a Horse</i> is stylized through a succession of massive planes, themselves stylized and exemplified, like a monument of Assyrian sculpture.
</p>

<p>
Next comes <i>The Cyclist</i>. Its edge is blue as the sky. Rectilinear apartments are cut by the rectangular geometry of windows. In the middle of the street, under a bored and immortal solitary street lamp, a rolling person arrives: a rapid flash of form in synthesis and in movement; the cyclist, light and formidable, wheels and muscles, spinning rays and curved body. His handlebar and hat shine in the sun.
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Another approach to form, another sensibility, another unitary synthesis of movement can be found in the work of Achille Funi. This young painter moves fluently and quickly towards his target with a clear sense of direction, a wonderful simplicity, and an unwavering will not to allow himself either to disturb or to slow down his journey with sentimental detours towards the past. He has the robust, square shoulders of the pioneer who never gets exasperated or lost in minor details, but instead moves cleanly and firmly "in medias res."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Funi is the artist in this group who seems to be setting out with the fewest hesitations and uncertainties, with a distinctive emphasis on concise and sober energy, towards definitive expressions of his personal style.
</p>

<p>
Look at the pleats of the tablecloth and the objects on the table in <i>Family at the Table</i>; and at the characteristic deformation of heads under the diffuse light raining down from a lamp. And then consider <i>Construction of a Woman</i> and above all, the <i>Motorcyclist</i>: a work I would not call perfect and definitive, but certainly fully self-sufficient. It leaves behind the realm of experimentation to dig deep into the core of its own unmistakable vital force. Never before has the graphic and plastic synthesis of movement been captured by means of such firm and precise lines. Funi has summed up the sight of the motorbike with the greatest simplicity. The sky-blue haziness of the air that palpitates and cools down in bluish hues around the hub of the wheels. The speed of the wheels themselves establishes an elliptical spiral for our eyes. The rider's head is reduced to a mere pink-colored oval. The painter has implied all the particulars by means of solid lines and supple color, forcing the viewer to guess.
</p>

<p>
Achille Funi solved these arduous and ultradelicate problems with a firm sense of modern beauty, of precision and elegance that is both modern and classical.

A closing word for reflection on the part of cultured, illustrious, and above all, know-it-all, semi-witty critics:

2. The Italian Artistic Avant-garde and Invitations to the Venice <i>Biennale</i> (February 29, 1920)
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Matisse, in front; and just behind him, quite a few other Frenchmen from audaciously innovative movements; not to mention Van Gogh, Gauguin, and C&#x000E9;zanne: great names, great works so dense with meaning that even hallowed death and the passage of time could not blunt their combative and hard-fought pictorial modernity. It is said that these will be the artists for whom the doors of the next Venice Art <i>Biennale</i> will open.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps owing more to circumstances than to his personal faults, Antonio Fradeletto had recently allowed Venice's periodic art exhibitions to come under the dominion of a gang of mediocre officials from various countries.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Vittorio Pica succeeded Fradeletto as Secretary General of Exhibitions. He seems to have gone to Paris in the mode of an indebted subject to freshen up the shabby canvases and statues of the foreign pavilions, which had become rather like fireplace trimmings.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The same can be said of Switzerland regarding its individual exhibitions of the work of painters Buri and Hodler.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
France, and even Switzerland. But Italy?
</p>

<p>
Oh, Italy! In Venice, Versailles-style, one might think that Italy is a <i>quantit&#x000E9; n&#x000E9;gligeable.</i>
</p>

<p>
We have&#x02014;I do not mind repeating it forcefully for those who find it comforting, even chic to continue snobbishly to ignore it&#x02014;we have, thank God, avant-garde art in Italy.
</p>

<p>
Can you explain why, amidst all the avant-garde and innovative art from other countries, we have allowed Italy to be forgotten? Or rather, did we deliberately decide to ignore and exclude Italy?
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Evidently there is no real reason why invitations are extended to foreigners who have already achieved wealth, among other things, due to their access to an audience 

<b></b>

more vast and cosmopolitan, more lively, shrewd, moneyed, and flexible, like that found in a city like Paris. Why, I say, are such enormous opportunities offered to foreigners, while innovative Italian artists have to face the expense, risk, and uncertainty of submitting their work for the verdict of a jury? The very artists whose honorable and often heroic struggles against poverty, against a public smothered under a blanket of opaque indifference, and against so-called "connoisseurs" and critics, armed with a sneer of stilted incomprehension and malicious derision, are legion. What justice or recognition might ever be expected from our usual juries? Italian artists have good reason to refuse&#x02014;they do so energetically&#x02014;the humiliation and degradation of this disparity in treatment, which works to their detriment.
</p>

<p>
Yet there are Italian invitees to the coming 1920 <i>Biennale</i> and their numbers are far from negligible. Who are they? The usual familiar and mostly rancid names and, in addition, numerous "youth," by only those who have been "tamed."
</p>

<p>
Pomi is one of them. He is a Venetian who remakes Ettore Tito timidly and cunningly by moonlight, with more pettiness and less high-class smoothness. In the postwar year 1920, can you imagine a Petrarchan whose Petrarch is named Ettore Tito?<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't hesitate to state that if the Venice <i>Biennial</i> goes forward as currently planned and if its guiding lights do not aim for more balanced, reasonable, and healthy outcome, it will be the most disastrous assault on Italian art that has ever occurred on Italian soil.
</p>

<p>
Until present, the Venice <i>Biennali</i> maintained a staid, and in a certain sense, traditional appearance, at once routine and official: "traditional" not in the sense of any true and great tradition. One could deplore the event, but it at least remained consistent and, given its unilateral tendencies, it maintained a certain uniformity of impartial balance among countries. It was, in this respect at least, unassailably correct and honest. Today that is no longer the case.
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The Venice <i>Biennali</i> are not the drawing-room or private homes of the Secretary Generals who have directed them over the years, where they can give free reign to their personal likes and dislikes.
</p>

<p>
They are, instead, public undertakings, conducted and subsidized by the public expenditure of cities and the state. With the money, that is, of the Italian taxpayer. Therefore, a rigid and objective criteria and impartiality are among the key qualities required of whoever directs them.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not the Secretary harbors sympathies for avant-garde Italian art matters little with respect to his duty to invite representative artists. From the moment he drops the veil of modest reserve towards the art of the combative extreme of France's left, with what right can he exclude from the list of invited artists <i>Italians in the land of Italy</i> whose effort is essentially synchronous and parallel with that of their foreign brethren?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Artists like Carr&#x000E0;, Sironi, Funi, Soffici, Dudreville, Depero, Russolo, Severini, De Chirico, Balla, have every right to enter through the front door of an exhibition whose doors are thrown open to the likes of Henri Matisse.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  This is no longer a question of art, but of common sense and simple rectitude on the part of an official who is, after all, the administrator of someone else's money. Accordingly, he is not permitted to spend such monies according to his own private whims, demonstrating partiality to some&#x02014;whether great foreign artists or tame little local darlings&#x02014;and hostility to others.
</p>

<p>
The long and painful experiences of modern history should have taught us something, given the systematic repudiation by official exhibitions, galleries, and museums, of works of art recognized later for their artistic merit, originality, and great significance. It is high time that men belonging to the establishment learn modesty and stop claiming that they possess infallible judgment. This system has made too many outrageous errors on too many occasions. The problem isn't with the not-so-illuminated preferences of individual director Joe Blow [<i>Tizio</i>] or his secretary John Doe [<i>Caio</i>].<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>   We are resigned to bad choices; they are inevitable. (<i>Axiom: A successful man is inevitably a man who has been surpassed</i>.) It is <i>choice</i> itself that we, of course, deplore: the right that some men claim for themselves to referee trends, fashions, and artistic schools.
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Does avant-garde painting exist in Italy today?
</p>

<p>
This is the question; the only real question that a man presiding over an institution like the Venice <i>Biennale</i> should have the right to pose. This art exists. It has been around now for years and shown a vital tenacity and undeniable combativeness. Who are its greatest, most famous, and influential exponents?
</p>

<p>
These are the questions that it is right and proper to pose. Whether the honorable secretary is subsequently free to shrug his shoulders and declare that the work of these artists is idiotic, empty, or execrable, matters not. He is entirely free, as a critic, to berate them or ignore them, reserving his enthusiasm for such an innovator as Edoardo Dalbono.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  No one questions his nor his successors' freedom of taste, good or bad though it may be.
</p>

<p>
What we formally contest&#x02014;we hope to have a minority on our side made up of the most lively and sensitive individuals who deserve to be taken seriously by the press and by Italy's intelligent and impartial artists, even those who are not innovative&#x02014;is the right to deny avant-garde Italian artists the possibility of proving themselves in the presence of a large Italian and international public. All the more so in an exhibition in which one grants this very right to a Frenchman like Henri Matisse, who is no less violently abhorred, ignored, and decried in France by the official art world than are Funi or Sironi, Soffici, or Dudreville among Italians.

3. Letter from Berlin: An Affirmation of Italian Art  (April 30, 1921)
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
A splendid affirmation of new trends in Italian plastic and pictorial art recently took place in Berlin, thanks to the initiative and merit of Mario Broglio, who organized a rich and organic exhibition of the leading artists of the Roman journal <i>Valori Plastici</i> at the <i>Kronprinz Palais</i>.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The journal's work hinges on such names as Carr&#x000E0;, Picasso, de Chirico, Soffici, Melli, Morandi, and Archipenko and requires little in the way of illustrations. It is one of the most agreeable and significant artistic forces combatting "the illusion of novelty."
</p>

<p>
Through a curious paradox, the very names that were previously leading the charge in favor of various artistic "-isms" are today leading the turn towards pure classicism. They are lining up against the theories of Monet that preach that painting should limit itself to soliciting the sensuality of the eye. Instead they are exploring the supreme harmony of mass, the profound refinement of an ensemble of well-constructed forms.
</p>

<p>
The theatrical mannerisms of Impressionism, Cubism, dynamism, . . . "fanfarism," led art to forget charm and softness, and to replace the picturesque and the lyrical with the grotesque and the simplistic. By returning to the painting of an earlier era, to its uncertain virginity, to its faithful imitation of visual reality, what is lost in outward appearance will be regained in substance, spiritual composure, power, and nobility.
</p>

<p>
Italian art must return to method, order, and discipline. It must achieve a definite, full-bodied form, a precise sense of gravity, analogous to and convergent with that of the ancients; independent of foreign fashions and mercantile considerations.
</p>

<p>
Originality and tradition are not contradictory terms. By returning to the purest traditions of Giottos, Masaccios, Paolo Uccellos, one does not renounce the originality of modern times, but only polishes off the rust and purifies our art of imitative alloys.
</p>

<p>
This is the philosophy, the spiritual program of the new school, conveyed in the Berlin exhibition by names like de Chirico, Francalancia, Morandi, Carr&#x000E0;, Martini, and Zur-Muehlen.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The largest number of works in the show are by De Chirico. He stands out for his rough boldness, his return to tradition, his attempt to achieve classicism by means of geometric technique. He is the first intrepid re to abandon modern curves. Being the first, it was perhaps inevitable that he should fall prey to the original sin of imitative mannerism.
</p>

<p>
Morandi, on the other hand, is the poet of form; an Italian spirit saturated with kindness. With rustic grace, ingenuous and fresh, he practices the art of color in order to approach nature. His still lifes are without a doubt the most beautiful objects in the exhibition.
</p>

<p>
As always, Carr&#x000E0; is powerful but is too philosophical-critical to be spontaneous and lyrical at the same time. His works are more interesting as profound studies of a dramatic state of mind than as the products of a pictorial instinct.
</p>

<p>
With a variety of canvases and sculptures, Francalancia, Zur-Muehlen, Martini, and Zabbrine complete the small world of new Italian art: a world that has captured the 

<b></b>

interest of the entire Berlin arts community and confirmed that our awakening knows no boundaries. Rather, its light is radiating in all directions.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

4. Promises and Actions: The Italian Academy (January 15, 1926)
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
"Having faced problems of necessity and moved them toward resolution, I have turned my attention to addressing questions of greatness." This is how the head of the Government [Mussolini] responded to a heated appeal from the National Board of Directors of the Corporation of the Plastic Arts on 27 October of last year.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  In so doing, he took on the obligation of placing himself at the head of a grand and energetic crusade for the benefit of modern art. After the Battle for Grain, less urgent but no less necessary is a campaign for modern art.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The speech given last December 31 lays the groundwork for one of the first challenges of greatness: building the new Rome.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Respect ancient Rome, restore it, and leave as much of its noble space intact as possible. The crowd, that dense and shameless human swarm gathering at the foot of the city's ruins, has beautiful and sacred vital needs that cannot be ignored. But respond to them by means of an appropriate, freshly built place, so that the new city and the old can coexist in harmony, with a variety of interconnections (narrow, dignified, majestic) between the two.
</p>

<p>
When France took over Tunis in 1885 (where we Italians should have been&#x02014;alas for us!), everything worked just as it should. Not a single stone was demolished in the ancient Arab city core, which was left serene and secure in all its local color. Even the smallest of picturesque and artistic delights found themselves safe behind the ancient walls of the <i>souk </i>and the <i>Casbah </i>(the castle). But outside the ancient city, toward the harbor, a new city was born: a city free and spacious, with wide tree-lined avenues and large open-plan houses designed according to western concepts of airiness, light, hygiene, and creature comfort. The old was not maliciously sacrificed to the new. Nor was the new twisted, altered, and falsified into the ancient.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
According to Theodor Mommsen, second only to the great historians of the Empire (Titus, Suetonius, and Tacitus) in his understanding of the spirit of imperial Rome, Rome can only be considered as a universal idea.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  For this same reason, the idea of the empire&#x02014;today less a material reality than a consolidated spiritual ideal-in-the-making&#x02014;flashes in the consciousness of fascism like a profound intuition.
</p>

<p>
This imperial unity of Italy's soul and self-awareness is also evoked and promised in the recent decree announcing the foundation of the Italian Academy. At issue is not an imitation or a servile and unoriginal (and, therefore, useless) copy of the French Academy, conceived of by Cardinal Richelieu three centuries ago [ . . . ].<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  Rather, what is envisaged will be similar to the Institut de France, graced by the genius of Richelieu, Mazarin, Colbert, and the French Convention in the course of its history, where, thanks to the recognition accorded the visual arts alongside the scientific disciplines, creation was consecrated as the key to the life of the spirit.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Still at its infancy in the seventeenth century, science today impregnates our entire lives, not only with 

<b></b>

its findings, inventions, and discoveries (whether in the fields of the physical sciences or mechanical applications), but also thanks to the vaster, more rigorous forms and methods with which it infuses contemporary thought. Accordingly, the Academy of the fatherland of Galileo and Leonardo will be composed <i>ex aequo</i> of twenty scientists, twenty artists, and twenty men of letters.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Italy achieved greatness when there were thirty centers of lively, impassioned, intelligent, and energetic work in the sciences, the arts, and letters among its universities and among the courts of its magnificent rulers. Then, because there were too many centers or because they declined, so too did the arts, sciences, and letters. And Rome was no longer the capital. And no other city or center achieved the decisive, crucial importance of Versailles, Paris, or London. So much so, that Italy's artistic and literary capital lay beyond the Alps for the entire nineteenth century. From Paris came the Word as well as fashion.
</p>

<p>
Why so? Above all, because the difference between sleep-inducing provinces and a capital that energizes is determined by the vital importance that is attributed (or not attributed) to the idea of art, to problems of culture and beauty, of the spirit and of ideas.
</p>

<p>
It is essential that, between a dance and a glass of champagne, the bejeweled lady and the elegant gentleman speak of art and literature; that the industrial tycoon feel obliged to discuss these matters with his colleagues and tablemates at the annual banquet of his management board; that [ . . . ] the banker and his wife, and the banker's mistress, as well as the suitors of the banker and his wife, assess the value of fashionable paintings, statues, books with no less zeal than they do the value of financial undertakings at the exchange [ . . . ] Why not? Isn't it essential that every lady from the provinces, every Madame Bovary thirsty for love and its elegant accompaniments, be made aware of certain names and certain works, or that every coarse merchant of silkworm cocoons, grain, or oxen feels obliged to demonstrate an interest in these matters if he wants to complete a sale when an important city client comes to visit?<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Fashion, artifice, vanity fair, snobbery? Certainly, they play a role. Art and literature&#x02014;all things of the spirit including the general principles of science&#x02014;must become objects of snobbery and fashion in order to become basic necessities, as fundamental as they are widespread. It is right and good that Baudelaire exalted Brummel and dandyism.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  Snobbery has a sovereign duty to create the atmosphere that, in turn, informs the intellectual environment. Every posture is the confession and profession of an ideal. Anything goes so long as it conforms to the ideal. Errant judgments, dilettantism, superficiality? Of course, they all abound. Each real achievement implies a decline, a violation: the desecration of an unsullied ideal. But an ideal becomes fecund, which is to say vital, only thanks to this contamination. Virgins enclosed within solitary convents are deprived of the glory of maternity.
</p>

<p>
Something of this flurry of action, turmoil, and expanding interest is already evident in Italy so far as ancient art is concerned. Suffice it to compare today's atmosphere with that of forty or even twenty years ago. How many collectors were there then? Today, there are legions. The much mocked war-profiteering was useful in this regard. One 

<b></b>

may think little of buying books "by the meter" to furnish study shelves or imitations of art works by the kilo for libraries and salons. But at least they were buying. And to buy means to become engaged. The book, once acquired, finds its pages cut and leafed through. One begins to read, to get comfortable with books. One develops the habit of looking at a painting and begins to build a natural familiarity with the work. After all, those who have made something from nothing and learned how to hold onto their wealth are no imbeciles. Taste is formed and refined by dint of looking and buying, by dressing up one's opinions and tastes in money, by endorsing the opinions and tastes of one's advisors, by dint of committing blunders. How many similar (and sometimes celebrated) shifts from initial crude and tentative first steps to shrewd and clever decision making, have we seen rapidly unfold before our very own eyes?
</p>

<p>
Now, what happened to the market for Titians and for more or less authentic antiques and furniture needs to extend to modern art. Illegitimate counterfeits of true intelligence, true talent, true modern genius will triumph initially. I am well aware that all human works are imperfect and defective. But woe betide he who would limit us to negation and inertia because of this acknowledged and uncontested imperfection of humankind.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to overcome this impasse.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to have faith.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to t.

To t so long as one can do battle, whether this means fencing, a duel, or facing machine-gun fire. To t seriously, gloriously, authentically, amidst the clangor of arms, under the tense and impassioned attention of judges!! To do battle with swords or cannons or even against windmills is a marvelous risk or at least an amusing adventure. But to perpetually bang one's head against the same deaf punching bag of indifference, ironic insensitivity, and materialistic skepticism: such unfortunately has been our lot over the last fifty years: a mortifying undertaking, a labor of lunatics that leads to mad fury or dejected atony and mortal inertia.
</p>

<p>
The greatest merit of futurism was that it jolted this public indifference twenty years ago with the force of its fists (and not only metaphorically so).<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  It is necessary to keep today's public awake in a positive, sustained manner by less drastic means.
</p>

<p>
An Academy's appointments yield multiple results. They breed hopes and disappointments, aspirations and ambitions, intrigues, applause, and condemnation. The prizes that it confers&#x02014;both those that it actually confers and those that it refuses&#x02014;provide a superb showcase that magnetically attracts all eyes. It is a hearth, a center of interest, a perpetual subject of conversation.
</p>

<p>
Too many people busy themselves with politics, with the conceited incompetence of big words mastered by none, assembling in too many workshops as well as in less open gatherings. To discuss art, science, or letters, it is necessary to have at least read something more than just the news. The art of a man of state, ruler, and shepherd of 

<b></b>

the people, does not consist in suffocating human nature (which will always avenge itself) but instead in channeling that nature toward higher or more fruitful outlets. The Italian Academy represents a formidable step toward the worship of culture, ideas in general, deeds of the spirit, moral events and conquests. It represents a formidable push toward the precise and concise study of disciplines&#x02014;even the most high, the most ideal of disciplines&#x02014;always approached with a scrupulous respect for technique and even love. (I employ the word "love" even at the risk of having dispensed it too lightly and easily).
</p>

<p>
Verbal bombast and mental sloth&#x02014;passions more closely intertwined than one might expect because the <i>bluff</i> of maximum result is always sought via minimal effort&#x02014;continue to poison Italian life. They have unleashed themselves without restraint in the domain of political theory on a terrain that is at once subjective and arbitrary. What if one were to discuss these general topics in greater depth, topics for which serious preparation is indispensable?

The path to the summit of thought and creation in the sciences, letters, and arts is arduous and fraught with sacrifices. The more one climbs unexplored paths, the smaller the number of men capable of following such a path, of comprehending it, of judging it. This exile from the hot, noisy communion of sheep into the rapture of great solitude is harsh. So easy, by contrast, is the inertia and make-do attitude that accepts any and all outcomes, that avoids the distilling process implied by great effort sustained by personal drive [<i>talentaccio</i>] (something the superficial and the simpleminded, always the majority, dismiss as mere "spontaneity"). The frozen thin air of high altitudes freezes and rarefies the enthusiasms of the majority, unprepared for work that is to be endured and enjoyed profoundly. That air is the bearer of the new.
</p>

<p>
Who would tackle such hardship&#x02014;the mocking of fools, poverty, the jests of the rich, and the long delay in achieving recognition&#x02014;if he were not sustained by a sense of the vital importance and urgent necessity of his own work? This can come only from the self. But to stimulate and sustain this longing for betterment, to t off discouragement and the lure of desertion, requires an inner circle of initiates able to appreciate the effort and to nourish it [ . . . ] For this inner circle, the more formally recognized and consecrated its authority, the greater its impact on the general public and the latter's judgment.
</p>

<p>
Even the Academy will sometimes make mistakes (though it will not always err). But its errors will translate a higher logic and reason into the realm of deeds and ideas. Even its potential errors will provoke discussions, explanations, and passions of the highest usefulness.
</p>

<p>
But keep in mind that one of Florence's neighborhoods was long ago dubbed "Village of the Merry" [<i>"Borgo Allegri"</i>] because a minor painter and former shepherd had painted a beautiful Madonna that the people carried triumphantly through the city streets! Those people sensed that the life of Italy depends upon its art. A Madonna

both human and divine sundered the shackles of inert rigidity. And Italian life suddenly shone under the sunlight of a new grandeur.

It is this atmosphere of sensitivity and passion and sharing that we now require.

5. At the First Exhibition of the <i>Novecento Italiano</i> (March 1926)<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
There was a true Italian art in the <i>trecento </i>(which still exists), the <i>quattrocento,</i> the <i>cinquecento</i>. Then came the eclipse. The <i>seicento</i> was all Spanish, Flemish, and Dutch, and, eventually, French. Artistic hegemony in the <i>settecento</i> and <i>ottocento</i> was in the hands of English and French citizens.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A secret premonition tells us that the <i>novecento</i> will once again be a century of Italian art. This premonition was born with the men and women who came to life in the first decade of the century. They were the grandchildren of the great generation that made modern Italy: the children of a discouraged and relatively inert generation [ . . . ]. Hypnotized by German <i>Realpolitik</i> between 1870 to 1900, their immediate descendents treated the most active and worthy workers to nothing but bitterness, while allowing the cunning to busy themselves with rhetoric and commerce.
</p>

<p>
"Faith is the substance of hope" and a strong and secure premonition of greatness in the spirit of those mysterious diviners known as artists. When faith spreads and becomes universal, it is already in and of itself the reason and cause for greatness to come, affirming its purpose, expressing its promise.
</p>

<p>
The phrase <i>Novecento italiano</i> isn't intended to define a tendency or to christen a group or to bind together a school or a sect. The label denotes a proud striving toward the creation of a singular style of art or living visage for the new century that gathers together all of Italy's strengths: an imprint, a style, a distinctive Italian face that can endure for centuries. As if the members of a militia, these artists dedicated themselves with tireless love to creating a new tradition worthy of Italy's ancient past.
</p>

<p>
The exhibition that the Head of Government inaugurated a few days ago in Milan is the first attempt to sound the roll call of this new militia. The call is crucial inasmuch as it will ensure that the lead cohort senses itself united, compact, endowed with courage, and emboldened. If nineteenth-century French art was so much more daring than ours, the reason was Italy's lack of a feverish focal point, a hearth heated by risk and bold ideas. Our artists toiled in isolation. Their efforts were scattered into the void, disappearing without an echo. Often they pulled back, discouraged, into their own shells to flounder and grope in the darkness. The result was some works of singular intimacy and deep interiority. Yet they lacked systematic construction and were without consequence. There were stupendous fragments, but never a great edifice. At least one of them&#x02014;Fattori or Ranzoni, Grandi or Cremona, or the young Medardo Rosso when he still resided in Milan?&#x02014;uncovered a patch of the heavens but never managed to open a path on earth either for themselves or for others.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The first exhibition of the <i>Novecento italiano</i> starts off with homage to the pioneers of the late <i>ottocento</i> with a retrospective of the work of Medardo Rosso: those unfortunate pioneers who, at best, received belated recognition in their fatherland. Medardo Rosso had to leave for France in order to find work, struggle, and glory. Only now does he return among us, fatigued by the many years of difficulties. And still he is appreciated only by a few.
</p>

<p>
His is an art of sensitivity, it is often said. Certainly, sensitivity plays a major role in his work. But within him there is austere courage, science, and profound experience, all of which permit him to give clear expressions to his sensitivity. He rejects all that is ornament and filler, sticking rigorously to his first direct impression. That's why he still adheres to an extreme type of impressionism. He rejects as inferior and detestable any and all art that subjects the genius's pure acts of intuition and deep feelings to the labor of intellect and willful elaboration.
</p>

<p>
This has nothing to do with laziness. Here lies the knot that differentiates Rosso from actual and eventual imitators. They cultivate hermetic airs yet traffic in what is facile. Rosso contemptuously rejects the facile, which is to say all secondary and exterior products of mere technique, in order to excavate and closely scrutinize the deep feelings that he brings to the surface from the depths of a trembling mysterious spring with remarkable artistic delicacy. There is something medium-like in the apparitions that he evokes by means of wax or bronze. But nothing unsteady. To an attentive spectator, the mystery of the spirit is captured by means of the play of light in the material, by means of definite, concrete, and certain signs [<i>segni</i>]: signs that, for all their distinctiveness, remain as still as those of a Donatello.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  The sublime head of the <i>Ecce Puer,</i> especially, is as great as an Egyptian sculpture from the era of the Pharaohs. Like that ancient art, it omits all superfluous things and homes in on the essential.
</p>

<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Between an artist like Medardo Rosso and one like Adolfo Wildt, the divide is great.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  Wildt's art refuses to host corners of mystery or shadow. Where Rosso barely grazes the wax with an almost feminine delicacy in order to confer a sense of shadow or revealing light, Wildt thrusts the scalpel into hard marble, determined to prove that it cannot resist penetration. To worship mystery by means of respect or to confront mystery in order to uncover it: these are two styles, both intent on overcoming the inert heaviness of material, demanding of it some beautiful secret of life. The solitary memorial to our poor comrade that adorns the rooms of <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i>, exhibited in the show, is a beautiful example of Wildt's logical, incisive, and arduous art.<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Domenico Rambelli from Faenza represents yet another artistic temperament, simpler, purer, and closer to mainstream sculptural tradition.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  He tends toward grandiosity and monumentality as evidenced by the powerful lines found in the fragments of his colossal monument to Viareggio's fallen soldiers.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  His cheerful and exuberant temperament is perhaps more clearly on display in the playful cartoon-like portrait of honorable Ciarlantini.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The challenges of religious-monumental decoration are confronted in Antonio Maraini's <i>Stations of the Cross</i>, designed for the cathedral of Rodi.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  There is a tempting superficial seductiveness to this decorative trend to which Romolo Romanelli and Arturo Martini also succumb, and, to a lesser degree, the Tuscans Amerigo Focacci and Libero Andreotti.<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
More profound are two heads, entitled <i>The Blind Woman </i>and <i>The Old Man</i> by Evaristo Boncinelli, a marvelous artisan and self-taught sculptor whose cruel illness has hindered his art.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
His compact modeling clings tightly to the reality of form, which is to say to the truth of spirit.
</p>

<p>
Painting hesitates at a crossroads between impressionism and renewed neoclassical certainty. One could say that the drama of modern painting consists in not renouncing the modern while attempting to infuse it with the eternal. To define the actual momentum of the human spirit and our modern vision through enduring things; to untangle the essential, which alone is simple and immutable, from the tangle of fleeting and complicated impressions.
</p>

<p>
Tosi, Carr&#x000E0;, Soffici, Sironi, and Funi confront this problem in various ways in both their landscapes and human res.<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  Among the landscape painters, Tosi gives the purest and most original solution by means of his plain and sober modesty. He departs from impressionism, and arrives at constructionism. By force of simplicity, by dint of proceeding from the momentary toward the essential, his spontaneous and limpid art finds forms and models itself on classical accents. Carr&#x000E0; is impeded by his excess refinement and archaism; but also in him such trends attain notable lyrical heights. His <i>Lecce,</i> acquired from the Gallery of Milan, is a work worthy of a museum.<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  The Tuscans, with Ardengo Soffici at the head of the pack, remain more closely tied to the reality of their land. Besides which Tuscany, with its dry limpidity and the elegant thinness of its lineaments, offers examples and warnings of inimitable style.
</p>

<p>
Regarding Sironi, I don't know why people continue to repeat the obligatory truisms about his seventeenth-century style and putative Caravaggioism.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  Certain patinas, certain softnesses of tone in the arrangement of tawny and gray shades do recall this or that form and color. But Sironi's paintings are glazed, compact, without flourishes of brushstrokes carelessly applied, and his spirit is austere and sad, entirely lacking in magniloquence, enclosed in a firmness that I would describe as taciturn.
</p>

<p>
There is a desire for grandeur and splendor in other works belonging to the Milanese group, the core nucleus of the Novecento, cases in point being two of the three canvases by Achille Funi. In the third, the <i>Venetian mask</i>, there is an airy lightness and spirited manner that display a perfectly palpable mastery acquired less by study than possessed by instinct.
</p>

<p>
Alberto Salietti has taken many forward steps.<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  Beside him are Pietro Marussig and Ubaldo Oppi with their female nudes of great carriage and of grand style; Casorati with certain new revelations of an art that, no longer chromatic and flat in its approach to form, now also investigates corporeal plasticity.<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  And Virgilio Guidi, Ren&#x000E9; Paresce, Monti, Piatti, Esodo Pratelli, Achille Lega, Tozzi, Trombadori, and Efisio Oppo with the 

<b></b>

<i>Carabinieri</i> and with the self-portrait done in a beautiful array of colors; Nino Bertoletti, Socrate, Sin&#x000F2;pico, Viani, De Grada, Dani, the most delicate Costetti, Montanari, Battaini; many names, many works, notable and praiseworthy.<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>  The median level of the show is very high and this matters a great deal because geniuses are not created, but talents can be nurtured. And genius itself is thereby encouraged and elevated.
</p>

<p>
Leonetto Cappiello sent his posters to Italy from Paris as a greeting, bringing from the French metropolis the fervor of life and a smile of art and joy.<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>

While it is well known that anti-Semitism became a part of fascist doctrine after the Rome-Berlin Axis in 1938, well before that there were influential res in the fascist regime who worried about Judaism's threat.

Georges Pierre Seurat (1859&#x02013;1891), Paul Signac (1863&#x02013;1935), and Jacob Abraham Camille Pissarro (1830&#x02013;1903) were French practitioners of post-impressionism. Seurat is known for his technique of pointillism, applying pigment in small dots of paint. Like pointillism, Divisionism breaks fields of color into brushstrokes, leaving the eye to reconstruct the colored image.

Sarfatti first lists four painters central to futurism, and later in the essay she discusses their exhibited works: Achille Funi (1890&#x02013;1972), Mario Sironi (1885&#x02013;1961), Luigi Russolo (1885&#x02013;1947), and Leonardo Dudreville (1885&#x02013;1975). Then she turns to Roberto Marcello Baldessari (1894&#x02013;1965), Ottone Rosai (1895&#x02013;1957), Primo Conti (1900&#x02013;1988), Fortunato Depero (1892&#x02013;1960).

Sarfatti mentions four artists affiliated with the Ballets Russes, a project that brought together avant-garde artists, designers, dancers, and musicians to create a modern ballet derived from folklore, cubism, futurism and constructivism: L&#x000E9;on Bakst (1866&#x02013;1924), painter and stage designer; Sergei Diaghilev (1872&#x02013;1929), choroeographer; and Mikhail Fedorovich Larionov (1881&#x02013;1964), painter. In mentioning Adolphe Sturzwage, Sarfatti may be referring to L&#x000E9;opold Sturzwage (Survage) (1879&#x02013;1968), Russian painter, designer and illustrator, known for abstract compositions. Of the eighty-four works by Depero that appear in the catalogue, there were eight costumes for <i>The Song of the Nightingale</i>, a production by the Ballets Russes of the work by Igor Stravinsky. That the second mention of Larionov reads "Sarionoff" in the original seems to be a misprint.

Sarfatti's comparison here is based on Friedrich Nietzsche's distinction in <i>The Birth of Tragedy </i> between the Apollinian and Dionysian elements, whose duality, he argues, drives the development of art. The Dionysian, he associates with intoxication, ecstasy, and enchantment: it is the realm 

<b></b>

of music and dance (non-imagistic arts), and involves self-forgetfulness and revelry associated with the Greek Bacchic choruses or the dancing crowds of the Middle Ages. The Apollinian, on the other hand, is best represented by sculpture, and is connected to the world of dreams. Nietzsche emphasizes Apollo's association with sunlight, truth, and perfection, and Apollinian art exhibits restraint, a freedom from wilder emotions, a sense of calm repose, and even sublime expression.

Sironi founded <i>Il Montello, </i>a short-lived bi-monthly published from September to November 1918 for soldiers at the Piave front, with the futurist writer Massimo Bontempelli (1878&#x02013;1960). Emily Braun has noted that Sarfatti likely influenced Sironi to take up the task of beginning and illustrating <i>Il Montello </i>(<i>Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism</i> [Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000]<i>,</i> 38, 231).

Founded by Mario Broglio (1891&#x02013;1948), <i>Valori Plastici</i> was published in Rome from 1918&#x02013;1922. Its contributors included most of the artists identified in Sarfatti's next paragraph, among others. Although the group did not have a definite program, writings addressed matters of Italy's cultural heritage, the values of classicism, and the accomplishments of foreign artists and art movements.

As Ruth Ben-Ghiat has demonstrated, Italy's city planning in Addis Ababa in the late 1930s included a structural plan that "enforced racial segregation."

Livy wrote during the Augustan era; his <i>Ab urbe condita</i> traces Rome's history from its mythical foundation to his present day. Suetonius' <i>De vita Caesarum</i> covers the lives of the Judio-Claudian emperors through the Flavian dynasty. In addition to his <i>Germania </i>(about the customs of the German tribes) and <i>Dialogus de oratoribus</i> (concerning the decline in Roman oratory), Tacitus' major historical works trace the history of the Flavian emperors (his <i>Histories</i>) and the period from the death of Augustus through the death of Nero (his <i>Annals</i>).

Sarfatti uses the standard Italian method of naming centuries: <i>quattrocento</i> refers to the "fourteen-hundreds," or fifteenth century. We retain it because it is popular in English-language writing about art, and because the name <i>Novecento italiano</i>, meaning roughly "Italian Twentieth Century," is meant to resonate with these designations. <i>Trecento</i> = fourteenth century, <i>quattrocento</i> = fifteenth century, <i>cinquecento</i> = sixteenth century, <i>seicento</i> = seventeenth century, <i>settecento</i> = eighteenth century, <i>ottocento</i> = nineteenth century, and <i>novecento</i> = twentieth century.

<p class="noIndent">
In the 1909 preface to "The Altar of the Dead," Henry James proclaimed his "earnest aversion to waste" and his belief that "in art economy is always beauty."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  These ideas develop out of a culture in which efficiency, economy, and the elimination of waste were increasingly heralded as industrial and social ideals. Modernist art, like the industrial cultures of modernity, engages centrally with the rhetoric of efficiency, aiming at, in Ezra Pound's words, "maximum efficiency," but an anxiety about exactly how to identify what was efficient in a work of art meant that the modernists' quest for precision and compression was often a matter of rhetoric as much as of practice.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Writers who identified themselves with a new, efficient art, such as Ezra Pound and Dorothy Richardson, disagreed profoundly over what that actually meant. The early years of British modernism saw the emergence of a number of different and apparently incompatible literary idioms, all of which were concerned with the ways in which literary writing did or did not waste words. In this article I shall focus on two of modernism's most characteristic and influential techniques, Imagism and stream of consciousness. Although the two might at first seem to be at opposite ends of the aesthetic spectrum, with Imagism featuring short forms such as the Japanese <i>haiku</i>, and stream of consciousness encouraging the inclusion of the smallest details in novels that could extend&#x02014;like Dorothy Richardson's <i>Pilgrimage</i>&#x02014;to thirteen substantial volumes, both methods aimed at adjusting the economy of the art-work to the economy of the world. Practitioners and critics of both techniques emphasized the thrifty nature of each form, arguing that the successful representation of the processes of 

<b></b>

perception required every word that arrived on the page. Gone were the days of the decadent era when art could represent itself as useless and extol the wastefulness of those who produced it. Now writers were in tune with the British middle classes, eager to expand their share of the national wealth. Art had to be modern and to be modern meant to be accurate, stream-lined, and efficient.

The efficiency movement
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In 1904, H.G. Wells delivered a lecture on local government to the Fabian Society and declared that the only question a local official need ask about different administrative structures was: "Which will give the maximum efficiency?"<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Wells' near-obsession with efficiency during this period was far from being an idiosyncrasy. The early decades of the twentieth century in Britain saw an explosion of exhortations and recommendations all aimed at increasing the efficiency of British society and minimizing its waste. As Jonathan Rose has noted, "Efficiency was, in fact, one of the great shibboleths of the Edwardian period," and in just a few years the ideal of efficiency had permeated almost every aspect of national life.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Efficiency came in many forms&#x02014;social efficiency, physical efficiency, industrial efficiency, domestic efficiency, mental efficiency, personal efficiency, and so on&#x02014;but in all its manifestations, efficiency was designed first and foremost to eliminate waste. "Social efficiency," as Benjamin Kidd defined it in 1894, entitled the "superior" races to take control of the raw materials of the world: "the last thing our civilization is likely to permanently tolerate is the wasting of the resources of the richest regions of the earth through the lack of the elementary qualities of social efficiency in the races possessing them."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The McKillops, popularizers of scientific management in Britain, announced in 1917 that increased industrial efficiency would result in "increase of production and elimination of waste," and in 1918, Henry Spooner, a London-based professor of engineering, noted that the "current of public opinion has been flowing strongly in the direction of economy and the elimination, or at least the reduction, of wastes."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The promotion of efficiency was a way of eliminating the waste and the low productivity that was linked in the popular imagination to decadents, the unemployed, the "inferior races," and childless women, and as the rhetoric of efficiency saturated much public discourse, the category of waste became more and more capacious, more and more threatening, and more and more ruthlessly suppressed.
</p>

<p>
Many people saw the efficiency movement as a kind of moral crusade and efficiency itself as a form of ethical superiority. Some definitions of efficiency were remarkably broad, describing it not simply as a method but as a moral philosophy. American sociologist Thorstein Veblen believed that efficiency was a kind of instinct and that people who for whatever reason lived inefficiently lived against the grain of their natures: "[man] is possessed of a taste for effective work, and a distaste for futile effort. He has a sense of the merit of serviceability or efficiency and of the demerit of futility, waste, or incapacity."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  To be efficient and to be surrounded by efficiency was thus to see one's nature developed to its highest potential. Arnold White, one of 

<b></b>

the most right-wing and outspoken proponents of efficiency, claimed that it was "the basis, and possibly the reason, of all moral law;" and American educational reformer Charles Eliot declared in 1909 that "the highest efficiency cannot be produced in any human being unless his whole character and his whole activity be dominated by some sentiment or passion."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Efficiency was not just a method or a system: it was the key to civilization. Beatrice and Sidney Webb, founders of the Fabian Society, even tried to establish a Party of National Efficiency in the early 1900s and attracted some support from Liberal politician Lord Rosebery.
</p>

<p>
Efficiency was not only a moral and political value, however. One of its most prominent socio-economic manifestations was the industrial efficiency movement, founded by F.W. Taylor and Frank Gilbreth in the U.S., and influential not just on factory management in Britain (where its impact was actually weaker than might be supposed), but also on everyday habits and customs. The elimination of waste was absolutely central to the philosophy of industrial efficiency. Gilbreth pioneered "motion study" in which close analysis of the movements made by industrial workers (Gilbreth took as his primary example a brick-layer) was used to reconstruct the worker's environment and duties such that no movement was wasted. F.W. Taylor, the inventor of scientific management, insisted that the most egregious forms of waste were those that were not even visible:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
We can see our forests vanishing, our water-powers going to waste, our soil being carried by floods into the sea; and the end of our coal and our iron is in sight. But our larger wastes of human effort, which go on every day through such of our acts as are blundering, ill-directed, or inefficient, and which Mr. Roosevelt refers to as a lack of "national efficiency," are less visible, less tangible, and are but vaguely appreciated.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Scientific management systematized tasks, introduced a central planning department into every factory which assigned particular jobs to each worker each day, and emphasized selection and training so that the worker undertaking the task was, in theory, well suited to the job, well prepared, and using what Taylor referred to as the "one best method and best implement."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Industrial efficiency was thus ideologically linked to movements like the Fabians' to enshrine scientific and administrative expertise at the heart of a reconstituted industrial society. Efficiency, with its reliance on educated experts, consolidated social and political power for a new middle class anxious to hold on to its privileges.
</p>

<p>
Alongside the movement for industrial efficiency, there also evolved a more chaotic, less regulated self-help movement, originating in the U.S. but quickly spreading to Britain, which sought to help people develop more efficient habits either in the workplace, in the home, or simply in their day-to-day lives. Novelist Arnold Bennett was one of the most enthusiastic proponents of what was known as "mental efficiency." He believed that "efficient living" depended on "the disciplined and vigorous condition of the brain:" "the brain is out of condition, idle as a nigger, capricious as an actor-manager, and eaten to the core with loose habits. Therefore the brain must be put into training."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The imperialist roots of the efficiency movement are apparent here in 

<b></b>

Bennett's casual racism. Lack of discipline and inner emptiness make men vulnerable to what Bennett thinks of as the African within. Thus he recommends "calisthenics" for the mind, like "the technical exercises necessary in learning to play a musical instrument:" our "invisible, yet paramount, mental organs are far less efficient than they ought to be."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In the U.S., it was possible to buy highly systematized training manuals to increase personal efficiency and readers were invited to rate their own efficiency through answering a series of questions. If, as one manual claimed, efficiency depended on having a system, hailed as "the sole means of getting the greatest results with the least waste," then prototype twelve-step programs such as those devised by Edward Earle Purinton and Orison Swett Marden modeled exactly what they hoped to teach: one-size-fits-all methods that were guaranteed to "save many grinding, discouraging and expensive years of haphazard experience."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Most of the personal efficiency manuals were aimed at office workers or managers and included extensive advice on how to organize a desk and a card index system, but industrial efficiency methods permeated even people's homes when popular women's magazine editor Christine Frederick pioneered "the application of efficiency science to the household" in her books on kitchen layout and equipment.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

Henry James, H.G. Wells, and literary waste
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
It may at first seem as if the primary concerns of the efficiency movement&#x02014;imperialist politics, industrial and domestic management, and self-improvement&#x02014;were far removed from the concerns of writers. But the evolution of literary modernity is shaped by very similar ideologies and discourses as those that produced Taylorist factories and gleaming, unruffled housewives. Henry James, for example, believed passionately&#x02014;at least after 1906, when he began to write the prefaces to the New York edition of his novels&#x02014;that he was pioneering a newly selective kind of art. In the prefaces, art is consistently represented as the process by which the events and objects of the world are contained and controlled. Art must struggle continually against the instinct of life to expand:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Any real art of representation is, I make out, a controlled and guarded acceptance, in fact a perfect economic mastery, of that conflict: the general sense of the expansive, the explosive principle in one's material thoroughly noted, adroitly allowed to flush and colour and animate the disputed value, but with its other appetites and treacheries, its characteristic space-hunger and space-cunning, kept down.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Even in this sentence the reader can feel the drive to elaborate, to add just one more clause. As James somewhat poignantly confessed to H.G. Wells, he felt he was "accursedly born to touch nothing save to complicate it."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The question of literary efficiency can also be seen to have structured the famous disagreement between James and H.G. Wells. The two met in 1898 when James was 55 and Wells was 32, and after 1900, when Wells moved into a house across Romney 

<b></b>

Marsh from Rye, where James was living, they met frequently, sharing work and ideas. Their relationship developed into a respectful but animated debate about the form of the novel, much of which has survived in letters they wrote to one another between about 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War. Unlike James, with his insistence on economy and selection, Wells deplored brevity, writing in 1911:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
But the novel I hold to be a discursive thing; it is not a single interest, but a woven tapestry of interests; one is drawn on first by this affection and curiosity, and then by that; it is something to return to, and I do not see that we can possibly set any limit to its extent. . . . I find all the novels of Dickens, long as they are, too short for me.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Wells believed that novels should engage actively with the world, and should reproduce as much of its multifariousness as possible within their pages. He thought of the novel as a "social mediator," with an active role to play in changing people's minds about the issues of the day.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  As Leon Edel and Gordon L. Ray put it, "Wells accepted the novel as what it had nearly always been in England&#x02014;an easy-going narrative unconcerned with its <i>raison d'&#x000EA;tre</i>."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The novel, in other words, was continuous with the world, not a distillation of it. Its aim was to reproduce life in all its extensive variety, and Wells saw this not as wasteful, but as efficiently productive of social change.
</p>

<p>
When the philosophical conflict between the two men finally emerged into the open, artistic economies were at the center of their quarrel. James seems to have fired the first salvo, at least in public, castigating Wells' writing in two pieces in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> in 1914 for going against the essential principles of literary creation.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Is not the witnessed pang of waste, in fact, great just in proportion as we are touched by our author's fine offhandedness as to the value of the stores, about which he can for the time make us believe what he will?<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
James implies that Wells is squandering his own resources, and he claims to find this particularly regrettable because those resources are, he politely says, valuable in themselves.
</p>

<p>
Wells was stung by James' public criticism and lost little time in retaliating. In his satirical novel <i>Boon</i> , a copy of which he left for James at his club, he accuses James of wasting words himself, referring to the "elaborate, copious emptiness of the whole Henry James exploit:" "Having first made sure that he has scarcely anything left to express, he then sets to work to express it, with an industry."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Their friendship did not survive the publication of <i>Boon</i> with its caricature of James' style. James wrote a hurt but dignified letter to Wells restating his belief in "<i>my</i> measure of fullness&#x02014;fullness of life and of the projection of it, which seems to you such an emptiness of both" (in other words, insisting that his writing was exactly proportionate to the reality it served); Wells responded weakly that "<i>Boon</i> is just a waste-paper basket;" and James allowed himself one more retort before lapsing into silence.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Beneath their conflict, then, lay a fundamental but unstated agreement: that writing and the world should fit together such that nothing was wasted, neither the raw 

<b></b>

material from which novels were made, nor the words into which it was transformed. Both men believed that they knew how to measure the relationship between them, what we might also simply call "literary form." That two such different novelistic styles could emerge out of beliefs that in some sense share the same priorities is remarkable, but the dismay with which both men regarded the notion of waste is perhaps more remarkable still. It could be argued that the beginnings of literary modernism are to be found in this preoccupation with a literary economy that was precisely appropriate to what was being represented. In other words, even those modernist writers who seem at first glance to be unworried about wordiness&#x02014;Henry James is a prime example&#x02014;turn out in fact to be centrally concerned with whether or not they are using more words than they need.

The Imagist ideal
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In 1913, in one of a series of announcements of the birth of Imagism, Ezra Pound published the following sentences in Harriet Monroe's magazine <i>Poetry</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Space forbids me to set forth the program of the <i>Imagistes</i> at length, but one of their watchwords is Precision, and they are in opposition to the numerous and unassembled writers who busy themselves with dull and interminable effusions, and who seem to think that a man can write a good long poem before he learns to write a good short one, or even before he learns to produce a good single line.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The insistence on brevity and accuracy in this piece was characteristic of Pound's aims for Imagism, and numerous commentaries on it, by practitioners, contemporaries, and critics, use the same rhetoric. Like Henry James, practitioners and advocates of Imagism justify their literary style in terms of its economy and its commensurability with the world. The watchwords that appear or are implicit in writings about government, business, and public health during this period&#x02014;efficiency, economy, organization, and so on&#x02014;are also central to the evolution of modernist theories of literature, which all identify modernity with a set of ideas and vocabularies that were fashionable in other areas of social and cultural life.
</p>

<p>
The story of the coining of the word "Imagiste," and its attachment initially to the work of H.D., has been told many times and in several different versions. Aldington claims that the Imagist movement was born "in the rather prissy milieu of some infernal bun-shop full of English spinsters" in Kensington, where Pound, excited by some poems H.D. had sent him, "removed his pince-nez and informed us that we were Imagists."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  H.D. remembers the occasion slightly differently, writing that she and Pound (but not Aldington) were going through some of her poems over tea when Pound suddenly "scratched 'H.D. Imagiste,' in London, in the [British] Museum tea room, at the bottom of a typed sheet, now slashed with his creative pencil, 'Cut this out, shorten this line.'"<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The two agree, however, that Pound appropriated H.D.'s style for his own movement, and H.D. tellingly places the conversation in the context of Pound mercilessly cutting 

<b></b>

her work. From the beginning, Imagism was associated with getting rid of extraneous material, with what Aldington called "ruthless" pruning.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Over the course of the next few years, as Pound established his leadership of his new movement, he made a number of public statements about its principles, all of them emphasizing the new poetry's efficiency, economy, and modernity. In the March 1913 issue of <i>Poetry</i>, for example, after the publication of the "H.D. Imagiste" poems in the January number, Pound and Flint published a couple of notes on Imagism, presenting what Pound later claimed were three Imagist principles that had been agreed on by H.D., Aldington and himself:
</p>

<ol class="decimal">
<li>Direct treatment of the "thing," whether subjective or objective. </li>

<li>To use absolutely no word that did not contribute to the presentation. </li>

<li>As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> </li>
</ol>

<p class="noIndent">
All three principles emphasized the elimination of wasted words or phrases and the closing of the distance between the object or event that was being represented and the language with which it was described. Pound and Flint do observe, however, that some writers might need to be trained to achieve this apparently instinctive harmony, claiming wryly that one of the "devices whereby [the <i>Imagistes</i>] might persuade an approaching poetaster to attend their instruction" included re-writing "his verses before his eyes, using about ten words to his fifty."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Above everything else, they valued brevity.
</p>

<p>
Some critics have argued that in spite of its origin in the work of a woman poet, the subsequent history of Imagism and Pound's loss of interest in it betray the masculinist bias of its beginnings.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Certainly one of the developments to which Pound objected was the emerging ascendancy of the American poet Amy Lowell within what he called the "<i>mouvemong</i>".<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  When Lowell suggested a series of annual Imagist anthologies, with each poet submitting poems of their choice and the contents selected by a committee, Pound agreed only reluctantly, telling her in August 1914:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I should like the name "Imagisme" to retain some sort of meaning. It stands, or I should like it to stand, for hard light, clear edges. I can not trust any democratized committee to maintain that standard. Some will be splay-footed and some sentimental.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Pound realized that with a loss of central control would come a slackening of standards, a less efficient, less systematic art. In later years he was to refer to Imagism under Lowell as "Amygism," as if it had been taken over by the flamboyant, insecure personality of its second leader.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  But even if this was true, some of the qualities reflected in Imagism's initial ideals&#x02014;"as much like granite as it can be," in Pound's words&#x02014;were hardly flattering to its original instigator, whose obsession with technique had often betrayed a characteristically stony stubbornness.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The main change when the movement was taken over by Lowell was away from the rhetoric of efficiency. Pound had not hesitated to describe his new poetry as "efficient:" "It is as important for the purpose of thought to keep language efficient as it 

<b></b>

is in surgery to keep tetanus bacilli out of one's bandages;" "We believe in maximum efficiency;" "I mean something like 'maximum efficiency of expression'; I mean that the writer has expressed something interesting in such a way that one cannot re-say it more effectively."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  As in the rhetoric of Taylorism, efficiency was about finding the "one best way" from which literary, economic, and industrial health would follow.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  In his Vorticist phase, following swiftly on the heels of his Imagist phase, Pound explicitly took the industrial and technological landscape so dear to proponents of the efficiency movement as his aesthetic ideal, remarking that "the forms of automobiles and engines, where they follow the lines of force, where they are truly expressive of various modes of efficiency, can be and often are very beautiful in themselves and in their combinations."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Here efficiency and beauty are explicitly linked. In losing its ties with Pound, the Imagist movement also lost its closeness to the rhetoric of the efficiency movement, and that change may well be linked to the shift in gender dominance within the group. In spite of the prominence of women such as Beatrice Webb and Christine Frederick, overall, like most public campaigns at this period, the efficiency movement was shaped by the perspectives and priorities of men.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Even Frederick was careful to describe how she first learned about "motion study, standard practice" and "scientific management" by listening to a conversation between her husband and a male colleague while she was "sitting by the library table, mending."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  The domestic efficiency movement represents the entry of the masculine world of factory management into the feminine world of the home, but men are still in charge of the conceptualization of the private sphere. It was perhaps inevitable, as Pound suspected, that a more democratic Imagism presided over by a woman might appear to have lost some of the sharpness of its focus on being efficient.
</p>

<p>
The Imagist movement under Pound was reminiscent of the efficiency movement not only in its ideals but also in what&#x02014;under his leadership at least&#x02014;was essentially its management structure. Josephine Goldmark, chair of the committee on the legal defense of labor laws of the American National Consumers' League, wrote in 1912 that:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Ordinary management leaves the workers in any industry to learn and pursue their trades by imitation from their fellows, by tradition and the rule of thumb. Scientific management assumes the responsibility of teaching the workman a predetermined task and keeping him adequately provided to accomplish this task.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A more efficient poetry, like a more efficient product, could be achieved only by adequate education and centralized control, since poets were peculiarly prone to whimsy. In this context, Pound's resistance to a more democratized structure to the Imagist movement makes sense. From the beginning, Imagism had been his idea and for a long time had remained under his control: he corrected the work of the Imagist poets he published, placed it in magazines such as <i>Poetry</i> and the <i>New Freewoman</i>, and eventually gathered it all together into a book he himself edited. Not only the art but the process by which it was produced reflected the emerging ideal of efficiency, with its vision of factories in which new layers of middle management ensured that products and the production process were reliable and consistent.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
However, neither the efficiency movement nor Imagism could ever quite live up to their ideals, and the shortfall in both cases exposes the intransigence of human nature and of the art that expresses it even in the face of concerted efforts to render that intransigence irrelevant. All those involved in promoting efficiency knew that absolute efficiency was only an aspiration. Edward Earle Purinton, author of <i>Practical Course in Personal Efficiency</i> , comments that "If you are as talkative as most people, a half hour a day would be a mild estimate of the lost time in foolish wagging of the tongue," but of course "foolish wagging of the tongue" was one of his readers' greatest pleasures.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  In spite of the rousing rhetoric of the management manuals, it was clear that elimination of all waste of any kind was an impossible goal. Much of the time waste was the route to happiness or to relaxation, and even watertight systems had to contend with the errors and the unreliability of human beings.
</p>

<p>
Like efficiency, Imagism sometimes seems more like a set of impractical instructions than an actual poetic practice. Even Pound admitted that "Imagisme, in so far as it has been known at all, has been known chiefly as a stylistic movement, as a movement of criticism rather than of creation," and numerous critics since Pound have made much the same observation.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Laura Riding and Robert Graves dismissed Imagism in 1927 as "a stunt of commercial advertisers as poetry;" and even recent critic Peter Jones notes that "the poems in the anthologies often don't tally with the precepts of the manifesto (which are we to believe&#x02014;practice or theory?)."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Imagism shared with the efficiency movement a certain fantastic quality. Perhaps it was as impossible to write a truly Imagist poem as it was to lead an absolutely efficient life.	Indeed, some critics have argued that almost none of the poems published under the Imagist label actually conform to its principles.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Aldington's "Au Vieux Jardin," for instance, one of the first poems to attract Pound's attention as an example of Imagism, loosely weaves references to the emotional state of its speaker in with a series of images of the garden that also presents the story of his developing feelings:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
I have sat here happy in the gardens, 
<br />
Watching the still pool and the reeds 
<br />. . . 
<br />
But though I greatly delight in these and the water lilies, 
<br />
That which sets me nighest to weeping  
<br />
Is the rose and white colour of the smooth flag-stones . . .<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
As Cyrena Pondrom points out, the poem opens with the speaker's feelings and only then moves on to their image or cause, rather than making the image central to the poem as Pound advocated: "The point of Imagisme is that it does not use images <i>as ornaments</i>. The image is itself the speech."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Nor does the poem present its subject matter with any special "directness," as the three principles in "Imagisme" recommend; and it is hard to determine whether every single word contributes in some essential way to the presentation. Certainly as the poem stands every word adds something, but would it make much difference if, for example, the water lilies were omitted? 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Another of the poems that was central to <i>Des Imagistes</i>, and which has provoked a good deal of critical discussion, was H.D.'s "Hermes of the Ways." It was this poem that Pound edited and signed "H.D., Imagiste" in a flourish at the founding of the Imagist movement. "Hermes of the Ways" is a relatively long poem based on a quatrain by third-century poet Anyte of Tegea. Even in its conception, elaboration, not economy, was the rule. The first stanza evokes footprints cracking the crust of sand on a beach, followed by an image of water breaking over it and an evocation of Hermes, who stands on the beach facing in three directions as wind and sand whip around his ankles. The speaker, who by the end of the poem is allied with a sailor around whom "the great sea foamed," and for whom Hermes waits patiently, is bound for the liminal point at which sea meets shore, as if the point of the poem is to generate ambiguities and allow multiple perspectives to open up all at once. In spite of its emphasis on a series of visualizations, the poem has a discursive feeling, and in the third and fourth verses the speaker explains the poem's title and sub-text:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
But more than the many-foamed ways <br />
Of the sea, <br />
I know him <br />
Of the triple path-ways, <br />
Hermes, <br />
Who awaiteth.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The landscape is peopled with allegorical res as well as with the sand, the "coarse-salt-crusted grass," and the small, hard apples of the eighth stanza, and the speaker recounts her relationship with the idea of Hermes. Even if the poem is shaped largely through its images, it accumulates meaning through explanation, exclamation ("Heu!| It whips round my ankles!"), and action ("You have waited"). As Ford Madox Ford pointed out, one of Pound's most Imagist poems, "Liu Ch'e," was "a tiny novel."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Even images turn out to need a narrative and a context, however minimal.

The Imagist novel
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
If the ideal of economy was hard to realize in poetry, it seems even more incompatible with the traditional aims of prose fiction, especially as it emerges in its high modernist incarnation. Paradoxically, as the Imagist movement began to take shape, a parallel revolution was occurring in the world of the novel, as Dorothy Richardson began the long and arduous process of writing her autobiographical text, <i>Pilgrimage</i>. This lengthy, apparently rambling record of the day-to-day impressions, perceptions, and experiences of Miriam Henderson ushered in what soon came to be known as "stream of consciousness" fiction. In the hands of writers such as Katherine Mansfield, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf, it became one of the hallmark techniques of literary modernism, alongside Imagism. But where Imagism sought to be concise, stream of consciousness emphasized inclusiveness, length, and detail. It was as if during the 

<b></b>

turbulent years of the First World War, poetry and literary prose were headed in different directions. However, questions of efficiency and waste were central to the aesthetic and to the reception of each form, and I shall suggest in this section that the avoidance of waste was as important to <i>Pilgrimage</i> as it was to Imagism. Both artistic forms identified themselves with the modern world, and that meant that both were concerned with the relationship between the economy of the text and the economy of the world. Paradoxically, similar principles lie behind both sets of conventions, even if they are articulated very differently.
</p>

<p>
The first volume of Dorothy Richardson's <i>Pilgrimage</i>, <i>Pointed Roofs</i>, was published in 1915, a year after <i>Des Imagistes</i> and the same year as the first <i>Some Imagist Poets</i> anthology. Richardson was friendly with H.D., Pound, and Aldington, and must have been aware of their efforts in defining and publicizing their new poetic movement. Richardson's writing, with its fragmentary sentences, its intimate rhythms, and its air of informality is unmistakably a prose version of <i>vers libre</i>, at least as Ford Madox Ford defines it as "the conversational sentence of the author."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Her new style is evident from the opening pages of <i>Pointed Roofs</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
There would be no more silent sunny mornings with all the day ahead and nothing to do and no end anywhere to anything; no more sitting at the open window in the dining-room, reading Lecky and Darwin and bound <i>Contemporary Reviews</i> with roses waiting in the garden to be worn in the afternoon, and Eve and Harriett somewhere about, washing blouses or copying waltzes from the library packet . . . no more Harriett looking in at the end of the morning, rushing her off to the new grand piano to play the <i>Mikado</i> and the <i>Holy Family</i> duets.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The pace of the novel is leisurely, its narrative threading in and out of Miriam's perceptions, her memories, and her thoughts. The central idea of the paragraph&#x02014;that Miriam is leaving her childhood home&#x02014;is elaborated in a series of participial clauses describing the familiar routines of the household from which Miriam will be excluded. As she remembers them she marks them as lost, building up an atmosphere of nostalgia and regret that emanates as much from the repetition of "no more" as from the classically English summer activities that Miriam evokes. The images seem to unfold out of each other, as if there is no end to what she will miss. This feeling of saturation continues throughout <i>Pilgrimage</i>'s thirteen volumes, as if the richness of the world and of Miriam's consciousness is barely touched even by the novel's copiousness. Ford Madox Ford wrote of the novel's "singularly fussy inclusiveness," implying that Richardson could not bear to omit a single detail.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Like Ford, many of <i>Pilgrimage</i>'s contemporary reviewers felt that the novel was colossally wasteful of words. Since they were responding to the early volumes, they are registering not only concern about the novel's length (although as volume after volume appeared with no end in sight, that may have been at the backs of their minds) but also, and more importantly, something extravagant in the novel's conception and style. Katherine Mansfield, for example, saw <i>The Tunnel</i> , the fourth volume of <i>Pilgrimage</i>, as a kind of wastepaper basket:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
There is Miss Richardson, holding out her mind, as it were, and there is Life hurling objects into it as fast as she can throw. And at the appointed time Miss Richardson dives into its recesses and reproduces a certain number of these treasures&#x02014;a pair of button boots, a night in Spring, some cycling knickers, some large, round biscuits&#x02014;as many as she can pack into a book, in fact. But the pace kills.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Mansfield objected that "until these things are judged and given each its appointed place in the whole scheme, they have no meaning in the world of art;" "everything being of equal importance to [Miriam], it is impossible that everything should not be of equal unimportance."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Faced with this bewildering plenitude, the reader did not know what was important: significant details or episodes were indistinguishable from all the rest. Overall, <i>Pilgrimage</i> appeared to have no aesthetic economy, no way of establishing value for its protagonist, its writer, or its reader.
</p>

<p>
John Rodker, another modernist writer and publisher, agreed that <i>Pilgrimage</i> was remarkably wasteful of words. Reviewing <i>Interim</i> , the fifth volume overall, and the first to be serialized (alongside <i>Ulysses</i> and Pound and Fenollosa's "The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry") in the <i>Little Review</i>, Rodker complains that:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In this welter of material the reader feels like a Kafir carefully searching for the diamond swallowed the day before. Much is irrelevant, sundry sparkles attract but they are not the indubitable article. Still he cannot conceive of the stone being elsewhere and the search is protracted indefinitely.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Like Mansfield, Rodker observes that it is impossible to identify what is truly valuable in the novel. The assumption is that something precious is buried in the mounds of verbiage, but the novel gives the reader no help in finding it. The parallels with the central images of <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> are unmistakable.
</p>

<p>
However, not all the contemporary critics of <i>Pilgrimage</i> saw it as excessive; indeed, some viewed it as economical or even efficient. Randolph Bourne, writing in <i>The Dial</i>, called <i>Honeycomb</i>, the third volume, "an honest narrative, searching, living&#x02014;fantastic only to those who cannot feel these very modern ways of looking at the world."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Lawrence Hyde in <i>Adelphi</i> called Miriam "a delicate and efficient receiving instrument."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  In both these comments the modernity of the text&#x02014;its innovative method and structure&#x02014;is implicitly identified with an efficient accounting of the world, in which the apparently excessive length of the text is seen simply as an accurate measure for the abundance it portrays. One reviewer saw the book as the literary equivalent of Miriam's body, describing it as: "Written in a rapid succession of jerks and gasps, with words and stops and fragments of sentences shaken, one might fancy, out of a pepper-pot" and explaining that "the jerks and gasps are the pantings of Miriam's heart, with its aspirations and checks and dashes out to life."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  For all these critics, the novel reproduces the manner in which Miriam's consciousness, mediated through her body, encounters the world, and because of this the apparently meandering nature of the text and its incorporation of pages of undifferentiated material are exactly its triumph. The novel is not throwing words away; rather, it is the first text ever to bring the world to 

<b></b>

life on the page. What seems to be waste turns out to be an unfamiliar manifestation of accuracy and completeness.
</p>

<p>
The novel's most famous review advances exactly this opinion. In the April 1918 number of the <i>Egoist</i>, May Sinclair defended the first three volumes of <i>Pilgrimage</i> against their detractors, arguing that: "In identifying herself with this life, which is Miriam's stream of consciousness, Miss Richardson produces her effect of being the first, of getting closer to reality than any of our novelists who are trying so desperately to get close."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  Sinclair is acutely aware of the economy of the novel, noting that certain crucial events, such as Miriam's mother's suicide, are suppressed except in the form in which Miriam, shocked and confused, is first half-aware of them. Other critics objected strongly to this, observing that the novel was at times "all but unintelligible . . . because [Richardson] will not take the trouble to master one of the standing difficulties of narrative, which is to give the reader the plain facts without letting them get in the way of their significance to the characters."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Sinclair maintains that these omissions are one of the novel's strengths, testimony to its fidelity to the shapes and forms of experience: "The first-hand, intimate and intense reality of the happening is in Miriam's mind, and by presenting it thus and not otherwise Miss Richardson seizes reality alive."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  Far from including everything, Richardson was highly selective, presenting only what the reader really needed to know. Thus even though it is accurate to point out, as many critics have done, that Sinclair emphasized the inclusiveness of Richardson's approach ("It is just life going on and on and on"), it is also important to acknowledge that Sinclair praised her for knowing what to miss out: "Nothing happens, and yet everything that really matters is happening."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Far from having no system of value, <i>Pilgrimage</i> sought to inaugurate a new way of distinguishing between what was needed and what should be discarded. It had its own economy and within its terms, the novel was not wasting anything at all.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, both Sinclair and Richardson thought of it as highly compressed. Sinclair noted that <i>Pilgrimage</i> manifested "an extraordinary compression," observing that "Miss Richardson disdains every stroke that does not tell."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  Richardson, who disagreed with Sinclair on many things and blamed her for the term "stream of consciousness" with which, after Sinclair's review, she was invariably associated, nonetheless agreed strongly that her aim was to concentrate her material, writing regretfully in 1921: "This business of compression, so essential, if the unity &amp; continuity of consciousness is to be conveyed, gets of course more troublesome as the material accumulates."<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  Six years later she referred to "the need to condense that grows with each vol.," claiming of <i>Oberland</i>  that: "Each episode could have filled a single volume in the old [wudgy?] manner - but I should have been in my grave before M's fortnight was at an end &amp; there are things calling ahead."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Richardson, far from thinking of <i>Pilgrimage</i> as an exercise in inclusion, clearly felt frustrated by the constraints of her chosen method, as if it was essential that she never offer any unnecessary information or use any redundant words.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the obvious differences between Imagism and stream of consciousness, then, both aspired to an accuracy and an efficiency that were implicitly associated with 

<b></b>

the modern world, and particularly with urban spaces. Contemporary critics were in no doubt that Richardson was writing the first Imagist novel. Randolph Bourne noted that the "particular idiom and vision of this writer are the same as those of the makers of Imagist verse," and described some passages, "like Miriam's walk on Regent Street," as "pure Imagism."<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Babette Deutsch claimed that "Miss Richardson's work has obviously the emphasized qualities of Imagism: clarity, precision, the intense subjectivity of impressionism allied with the objectivity of the realist."<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  In its concentration on the exchanges between the inner and the outer worlds, as well as in its focus on concrete details, <i>Pilgrimage</i> seemed to follow Imagist principles. Bizarrely, a novel which was criticized by some reviewers for being "a mass of intricate detail" and a pile of "disjointed debris" could also be likened to some of the most condensed and highly structured poetry written in English.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the key to this paradox, as to so much else in British modernism, lies in the work of the writer with whom I opened this chapter, Henry James. As Jonathan Freedman has argued, James "played a particularly crucial role in the remodeling of the uncanny, stable, fascinatingly volatile and constantly critical discourse of aestheticism in England into the austere, hermetic, and resolutely self-satisfied discourse of high Anglo-American modernism."<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  Richardson, in the preface to the 1938 edition of <i>Pilgrimage</i> that she wrote under duress at the request of her publisher, backhandedly salutes James' influence on the style she was now becoming reluctant to endorse. Recounting critical responses to early stream of consciousness texts, she notes that:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
the role of pathfinder was declared to have been played by a venerable gentleman . . . inhabiting a softly lit enclosure he mistook, until 1914, for the universe, and celebrated for evolving, for the accommodation of his vast tracts of urbane commentary, a prose style demanding, upon the first reading, a perfection of sustained concentration akin to that which brought it forth, . . .<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Like her reviewers, Richardson identifies James with both verbosity and intensity. But even that acknowledgement of the way in which James keeps "the reader incessantly watching the conflict of human forces through the eye of a single observer" is swept aside later in the preface when Richardson goes on to say that she was relieved to find the same approach endorsed in <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, as if James is an ambiguous forebear at best.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  George Thomson has described the "Foreword" as "an act of obfuscation, a reluctant manifesto" that Richardson was persuaded to produce simply to stimulate sales of the new collected edition of the <i>Pilgrimage</i> novels, and some of the strangely evasive tone of her tribute to James may be attributed to the anger she felt at the idea of explaining herself to a reluctant body of readers.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  But perhaps it can also be traced to the paradoxical nature of the aesthetic philosophy she was defending, on the one hand dedicated to compression, and on the other hand to a faithful rendering of the teeming sprawl of life itself. The efficiency movement had produced one of the longest novels in British literary history.

Conclusion
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The stylistic disjunction between Imagism and stream of consciousness, even as their practitioners claimed to be aiming at the same thing, should alert us both to the centrality of efficiency to the theory of literary modernism, and to its extraordinarily contested nature. Efficiency was an ideology that in the broader society had been called on, since the beginning of the twentieth century, to support a wide range of politically and ethically loaded activities from imperialism, to eugenics, to the restructuring of the manufacturing industry. To be efficient meant to leave behind late Victorian styles and beliefs, and to move forward into a modernity in which Britain would compensate for her waning imperial power by increased productivity and the beginnings of a new global ascendancy in industrial output (or at least that was the theory). To be modern meant to espouse and endorse efficiency, and the modernity claimed by experimental writers during the First World War was no exception to that rule. But whereas in the area of manufacturing at least, no significant challenge to Taylorist practices arose, at least during the modernist era, in the literary world, concepts that seemed so straightforward when they were applied to social and economic life became much more ambiguous and hard to define. Writers tended to assume that literary efficiency meant a perfect fit&#x02014;or at least a fit that was as perfect as possible&#x02014;between the world and the text. Every word was needed, and every word helped to create a literature that fully and exactly expressed human experience without any surplus. But defining that "perfect fit" was as awkward as defining literary efficiency in the first place. In literary circles, the efficiency movement expressed itself as a series of manifestos, ambitious claims, arguments, and a range of hugely diverse primary texts. But one thing was clear: in its early years literary modernism could not afford to back away too obviously from the drive to increased efficiency or it would run the risk of looking old-fashioned. As Henry James put it, art must "produce the illusion of mass without the illusion of extent."<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  But just what that meant was almost anyone's guess.

The catalogue to The Menil Collection, <i>The Menil Collection: A Selection from the Paleolithic to the Modern Era</i> <i>, </i>reproduces on its frontispiece Max Ernst's <i>Portrait of Dominique </i>[<a href="#1">re 1</a>], commissioned by John and Dominique de Menil in 1934. This was the painting they had left behind wrapped in brown paper on top of a closet when they left Paris during the war, not liking it sufficiently to ship it to their new home in Houston or to leave it in the care of friends. Indeed, before that, it had languished for more than a year at the frame shop since no one had cared to collect it and no delivery address had been left. It was not until the framer finally put the painting in his store window that a neighborhood priest recognized the image to be of Dominique and the portrait was claimed (de Menil 1964). Long since redeemed from its ignominy, the painting now forms the heart of what has become internationally one of the most significant collections of the work of Max Ernst, which itself forms a part of the 15,000-piece Menil Collection.
</p>

<p>
Acquired over a period of 45 or so years, The Menil Collection is the formerly private collection of Dominique and John de Menil [<a href="#2">re 2</a>], open to the public since 1987 in the form of a purpose-built museum, designed by Renzo Piano. Considered a very important collection of New York School painting and among the most significant Surrealist collections in the United States, its holdings include pieces from an array of cultural and historical traditions. They have an antiquities collection; a very well regarded collection of Byzantine icons; Oceanic and African art; colonial art from the New World; and the European moderns, including Matisse, Picasso, Braque, L&#x000E9;ger, Mir&#x000F3;, and

Klee. In 1995, it opened a freestanding gallery solely for the permanent exhibition of the work of Cy Twombly, and in 1997, construction was completed on a chapel built to house thirteenth-century frescoes (the dome and apse of a Cypriot church) that were bought and restored by the collection. Since November 1998, Richmond Hall, an adjacent building formerly used for storage and occasional temporary exhibits, has been opened to the public, housing three site-specific works by Dan Flavin&#x02014;which was to be Dominique de Menil's final commission.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Each of these initiatives furthers an intricate moral, political, religious, and aesthetic agenda to which Dominique and John de Menil had given early expression in their 1964 commissioning of the Rothko Chapel, the Philip Johnson-designed, non-denominational chapel named for Mark Rothko whose paintings were commissioned for it.

Ethnography of Aesthetics
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The narrative of the rejection and subsequent rehabilitation of <i>Portrait of Dominique</i> has become the story that is told repeatedly to conjure the extent to which the sensibilities of the de Menils were transformed.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  It is presented specifically as the story of Dominique and John de Menil's aesthetic conversion, but more broadly it offers an account of the redemptive character of art. 	As I will show, this idea of the efficacy of art, specifically in the rehabilitation of modern sensibility, is central to the project of The Menil Collection. The art object for Dominique de Menil is richly imbued, not merely a plastic form, nor just the conveyor of symbolic meaning. It is at once an embodiment of the artist's sensibility, a catalyst for certain modes of experience, and as such it may serve as an instrument of spiritual restoration (though conversely it may foster the kind of moral or spiritual degradation that she observed around her).
</p>

<p>
Alfred Gell, in his essay "The Technology of Enchantment," addresses the way in which art objects can participate in "securing the acquiescence of individuals in the network of intentionalities in which they are enmeshed" (1992: 43). Here he draws attention to art's agency. As Nicholas Thomas points out, Gell's project responds to the failure of the anthropology of art "to dissociate itself from projects of aesthetic appreciation that do for art what theology does for religion" (Thomas 2001: 2). This failure can be read overwhelmingly in the body of anthropological literature on indigenous art that takes the tone of connoisseurship. The familiar critical response to this kind of connoisseurship, of course, has been the sociological project of demystification, in which art is revealed as really a sign of something else&#x02014;most notably of distinction and of power. While attention to the ways in which art is called upon to serve the interests of power has offered important insights, this approach overlooks the specificity of art objects and, as Thomas and Gell both recognize, their particular efficacy. This has entailed a flattening of anthropology's analysis of art and of the institutional and social processes with which it is entwined. Current work in the anthropology of art has, as Fred Myers points out, begun to respond to this, to consider the particular work done by art objects "as <i>indices</i> of agency and effective in mediating social relationships" (Myers 2004: 204).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Gell's frustration with anthropology's projects of aesthetic appreciation has led him, however, to eschew attention to aesthetics altogether, as if to take it seriously would be to succumb to its mystifications. My own project shares Gell's insistence on recognizing art as an agent in social processes, but it sees the production of aesthetic domains and all the density of experience<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  that they afford as central to art's efficacy. At The Menil Collection, the aesthetic that has been so attentively crafted is intended to produce an affecting engagement between persons and objects that is charged with the compelling intimacy of possession. The larger ethnographic project from which my analysis here draws is not an ethnography of The Menil Collection as a place or of Dominique de Menil as a collector, but rather it is an ethnography of an aesthetic &#x02014;specifically, of the processes by which an aesthetic is created, materialized, and participates in broader domains of social practice. In what follows, I argue that the density of the relationship between persons and objects that possession affords is extended at The Menil Collection beyond the prerogatives of ownership to the museum's visitors, or at least that is the experience that the museum seeks to foster. Further, I argue that Dominique de Menil has wished to generate this kind of engagement with art in the interests not simply of asserting the collector's distinction but in the earnest pursuit of an alternative project of modernity, a "sacred modern."
</p>

<p>
Having left Paris in 1941, Dominique and John de Menil [<a href="#3">re 3</a>] took up residence in Houston, where John de Menil served initially as the head of Schlumberger operations in South America and the Middle East. He is widely held to have been a major force in the emergence of Schlumberger as one of the world's largest corporations in the 1970s, providing oil detection technology to drilling companies throughout the world, technology that had been developed by Dominique de Menil's father Conrad Schlumberger and uncle Marcel Schlumberger (Allaud and Martin 1977, and Auletta 1983a, 1983b).
</p>

<p>
The de Menils' collecting began only after their move to the United States, with John de Menil's 1945 return from a business trip to New York with a C&#x000E9;zanne watercolor, <i>Montagne</i> (ca. 1895). They proceeded to buy the work of L&#x000E9;ger, Rouault, Picasso, and Braque, only later being introduced to the Surrealist works for which the collection has perhaps become most distinguished. While their collection was acquired only after they had taken up residence in Houston, their early purchases were made in New York, in a New York art world recently transformed by the presence of a significant body of exiled French modern artists and dealers (Guilbaut 1983, Sawin 1995).
</p>

<p>
Dominique and John de Menil, by all accounts, found New York beguiling, appealing to their distaste for the stifling traditionalism of France or, rather, to their enthusiasm for progressivism.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  And certainly it must have presented itself as a welcome relief from the grim urgencies of wartime Europe.
</p>

<p>
Their initial interest in buying art was in response to their friendship with the French Dominican priest Marie-Alain Couturier [<a href="#4">re 4</a>], who found himself in North America at the outbreak of the war. He consequently stayed on for some five years, circulating among exiled artists and working on the intellectual refinement of his own project concerned with the spiritual restoration of French liturgical art, contributing centrally to what became known as the Sacred Art Movement.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
There are a number of people who have powerfully influenced Dominique de Menil's acquisitions and shaped their subsequent representations in the context of The Menil Collection. But the first, and surely the most foundational, was Couturier, whose aesthetic judgments were inevitably infused with moral adjudications. "The fervor of Couturier's words," Dominique de Menil observed, "borne by the gravity of what he had to say, transcends the ephemeral and touches us like the mark of the absolute" (de Menil 1989: 9). His judgments and their ideological underpinnings, then, informed not only the de Menils' strictly aesthetic preoccupations but also a much broader agenda of moral and political activism.
</p>

<p>
Unlike many collectors who characterize themselves as having always had a special appreciation for art, Dominique de Menil describes herself as having been awakened to it under the guidance of Couturier who, she has repeated in a variety of ways, "opened her eyes," and "taught her to see."
</p>

<p>
Couturier fostered not only Dominique de Menil's ability to "see" art but encouraged her to buy it also:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[H]e cured me completely of my puritanical block against collecting. He sort of made it a moral duty to buy good paintings. . . . I remember one summer [during a brief stay] in Paris, he was visiting us, and my mother was there. We had been offered a lovely Rouault and we were not going to buy it because the day before we had bought with Father Couturier a superb Japanese sculpture.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  So at least we hesitated and he said, "Well, you must buy it. If you can afford it, just buy it." I remember my mother interfering and saying, "But father, if they keep buying art they will have nothing to eat but crumbs." And then, completely undisturbed, he said, "Madame, let them eat crumbs and hang good paintings on their walls." So we bought the Rouault.

On their frequent business trips to New York, John and Dominique de Menil would accompany Couturier in tours around the New York dealers. Dominique de Menil was not immediately seduced by the work she was being shown and was anyway initially uncomfortable with the idea of spending significant sums of money on the purchase of art. Her reticence was short-lived, however, and she very soon joined her husband in actively acquiring works and continued to do so passionately for some fifteen years after her husband's death in 1974; "once you develop a taste, you only stop when you have to" (de Menil 1983: 37). The drive to accumulate expensive luxury objects may seem at odds with one who seeks spiritual restoration, but this identification of material acquisition with moral dissolution is a view more consonant with Dominique de Menil's Protestant upbringing than with her husband's Catholicism, to which she converted after their marriage. Her embrace of Catholicism was profound. She established a deep friendship with Jacques and Ra&#x000EF;ssa Maritain, she attended Yves Congar's lectures on ecumenicism and was deeply affected by them, and she was to develop a heartfelt longing for the reunification of the Church, a rapprochement between East and West.
</p>

<p>
It was, Dominique de Menil has commented, the austerity of her paternal Alsatian Protestant forebears that prevented her mother and grandmother from themselves buying paintings. "One did not indulge in what was considered 'luxury': no rare books, no 

<b></b>

antique furniture, nothing really expensive except perhaps some silver. Yes, one had to have silver but not paintings. Paintings were considered ostentatious" (de Menil 1983: 36). Dominique de Menil apparently did not share her father's puritanism: "Certainly I did not inherit a tradition of patronizing the arts, but I inherited the craving, the unfulfilled craving of my mother and grandmother" (de Menil 1983: 36); a craving articulated in her oft quoted comment, "What I admire I must possess" (quoted in Browning 1983: 141).

In dramatic contrast to the identificatory assertion that <i>Portrait of Dominique</i> constitutes as the frontispiece to the Collection catalogue but taking an equally prestigious position, on the page facing Dominique de Menil's Foreword, is a painting by Domenico Veneziano, <i>St. John in the Desert</i>, ca. 1445 [<a href="#5">re 5</a>]. It is not as a particular jewel of The Menil Collection that this work is reproduced in such a prominent position. It is not only not held by the Collection, but never will be. Once belonging to Bernard Berenson, it is now held in the Kress Collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. In her Foreword, Dominique de Menil wrote this of the painting:

It is the strangeness of this choice of image that is the provocation for this paper. It seems at first glance a particularly brazen act of appropriation, or conversely, perhaps a strangely forthright marking of humility to draw attention to the limitations of her own collection. In any event, we read in the accompanying text of the collector's unabashed declaration of possessiveness which is ameliorated, in the next turn, by her sanguine recognition that objects in her own collection will be similarly subject to such impulses. Indeed, as we shall see, Dominique de Menil does not regard such possession as simply an unavoidable byproduct of others having access to the works in her collection, far from it. It is precisely this possessive relationship that she seeks to foster in those who engage with the collection. Without imagining this intimacy of possession, no matter how fantasized, the museum becomes a site of alienation where objects are paraded before us that can never be enlivened by the possibility of ownership. Dominique de Menil's reference to possession here speaks of the alchemy by which we might all become collectors, albeit vicariously, rather than merely passive consumers.
</p>

<p>
This notion of possession in the absence of ownership is taken up by the nineteenth- century essayist William Hazlitt when he characterizes the experience of possession as an impulse of envy and a process by which that envy is overcome in the recognition of the superior character of one's own engagement and appreciation. He offers by way of illustration an anecdotal account of the experience of "passing through a fine 

<b></b>

collection of pictures" as one of the "personal adoption" of the object of admiration, a practice that "always end[s] in a daring project of usurpation, and a determination to expel the actual proprietor, and supply his place so much more worthily with our own identity" (Hazlitt 1991: 193).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  While Hazlitt's somewhat snide characterization draws attention to the redemptive impulse even of this vicarious mode of possession, it also reveals in its ambition to displace the "actual proprietor" the disquieting aspect of this possessive relationship for the collector.</p>

What seems so surprising about Dominique de Menil's invitation to others to engage with works in her collection in a manner that is imbued with the intimacy of possession is that insofar as collectors experience a high degree of identification with their collections, one imagines that others "possessing" constituent works might be considered an affront, not only to the integrity of the collection but of the collector also. But, of course, possession for the collector enables not only the experience of engulfing intimacy but also the authority and control afforded by ownership. It is this compound notion of possession, Paul Holdengr&#x000E4;ber argues, to which Benjamin refers when he writes, "Possession is the altogether deepest relationship one can possibly have to things" (quoted in Holdegr&#x000E4;ber 1992: 96).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What I will argue is that while the Menil Collection should quite properly be understood as an instrument of the collector's project of self-fashioning, it is at the same time a very particular organization of a relationship between objects and subjects that can offer access to alternative projects of modernity.
</p>

<p>
The idea that there is a defining relationship between possession and personhood has been well established in the theorization of possessive individualism (MacPherson 1962) and has been further elaborated in discussions of collecting as an intensified form of this (Handler 1987, Clifford 1988). In this view, the collector's urge to possess is driven by a desire to materialize the self, whether as an expression of self, as a means to shore oneself up against loss, or as a technology of self-definition.
</p>

<p>
The collection is, as James Clifford notes, a "strategy for the deployment of the possessive self," an exercise in "making the world one's own, [gathering] things around oneself tastefully, appropriately" (Clifford 1988: 218). In this process the collector is not simply a consumer of objects but, as Susan Stewart notes, "generates a fantasy in which it becomes producer by arrangement and manipulation" (Stewart 1993: 158). While the ordering of objects within a pre-established series, the re-creation of a Victorian parlor, say, or the collection of seventeenth-century Italian paintings, suggests 

<b></b>

not so much production but the reproduction of a given form, the eclectic collection bears the sign of mastery:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Each sign is placed in relation to a chain of signifiers whose ultimate referent is not the interior of the room&#x02014;in itself an empty essence&#x02014;but the interior of the self.  
<p class="blockquote">
	In order to construct this narrative of interiority it is necessary to obliterate the object's context of origin. In these examples eclecticism rather than pure seriality is to be admired because, if for no other reason, it marks the heterogeneous organization of the self, a self capable of transcending the accidents and dispersions of historical reality.

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The Menil Collection is such an object; a materialization of a heterogeneous self that allows a unified expression in the form of a signature, "the Menil aesthetic."
</p>

<p>
Donor-built museums, which open once private collections to the purview of the public, can, in this light, be understood as an extension of the collector's project of the self, wherein the content and style of the museum become part of a rhetoric of a distinctively constituted self. And, moreover, insofar as the museum bears the sign of permanence, it can be seen as a technology by which a transcendent self might compellingly be articulated.
</p>

<p>
While in donor-built museums it seems that the public is called upon merely to bear witness to the creation of the collector, the members of the museum's public in fact become drawn in as agents in the process of the collector's self authorship, as are the museum's trustees, its staff, media commentators, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the "multiple agents and agencies," to use Debbora Battaglia's phrase (1995: 8), involved in the self-fashioning of the collector who opens his or her collection to the public, the donor museum&#x02014;insofar as it appears to present the singular vision of the collector&#x02014;has the peculiar ability to convey a sense of the collector as a self marked by individuality and personal distinction.
</p>

<p>
This preoccupation with the self should, however, be set in relief, lest Dominique de Menil's exercises in self-fashioning appear as merely self-servingly subjectivist. In his characterization of the various formations of modern selfhood, Charles Taylor draws attention to a modality of self-formation that struggles with the flattening and distancing of the experience of modernity. This struggle, far from being simply therapeutic, is engaged in a more extended vision: "the search for moral sources <i>outside</i> the subject through languages which resonate <i>within</i> him or her, the grasping of an order which is inseparably indexed to a personal vision" (Taylor 1989: 510).
</p>

<p>
The de Menils and The Menil Collection itself have quite self-consciously participated in this struggle with the disenchantments of modernity. In seeking to create the conditions of possibility for a personal, resonant experience, they have sought to retrieve a moral engagement with the world that is governed neither by an "objective order" nor by a "procedural instrumentality," to use Taylor's terms. This kind of experience is conjured at The Menil Collection through the production of intimacy mediated by aesthetics.

Redemption
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The museum's galleries are constructed as more or less discrete domains that may be reached independently of each other from a central promenade [<a href="#6">re 6</a>]. The large galleries are themselves subdivided, some temporarily in response to the requirements of specific shows, others more or less permanently, to create more modestly proportioned rooms for some of the semi-permanent installations. What was sought in the interior arrangement of the galleries were intimate spaces, wherein a person might experience a visceral engagement, in which, as Dominique de Menil has expressed it, "one's territory is invaded by a work of art such that it demands a response" (de Menil 1968: 11). The intimate character of these spaces relies not only on their strictly architectural form, but also on a range of more ephemeral evocations [<a href="#7">re 7</a>]. Lighting is carefully attended to and there are no physical barriers between the artworks and the viewer, no lines drawn on the floor, and Plexiglas is used sparingly, and always with great regret. Works are hung considerably lower than at many museums, such that one meets them more or less at eye level. There are no didactic wall panels and labeling is spare; docents and audio guides are absent. And, moreover, there are no crowds.
</p>

<p>
In the architecture of the museum, through the installation of exhibitions, and throughout the organization and practice of the museum in, as I have elaborated elsewhere (Smart 1997, 2000, 2001), an economy of excessive care, The Menil Collection generates an aesthetic that seeks to rehabilitate the sensibilities of the viewer. The alienation that is expressed in the familiar attitude of silent veneration, might, in this construction, be overcome through the intimacy of possession.
</p>

<p>
In the context of The Menil Collection, then, art objects are engaged in a complex project of redemption operating across a range of registers. The notion of art playing a redemptive role is of course not new, but recognition of that role, in itself, does not offer much analytically. As Max Weber points out, "the meaning as well as the intended and actual psychological quality of redemption" has depended upon a systematic "image of the world . . . 'From what' and 'for what' one wished to be redeemed and, let us not forget, 'could be' redeemed, depended upon one's images of the world" (Weber 1958: 280).
</p>

<p>
This redemptive imperative can be understood in terms of Dominique de Menil's deep engagement with the French Sacred Art Movement and with Catholicism itself. Permeating her accounts of her spiritual and aesthetic commitments are expressions of longing, for experiences of immediacy in which sensibility takes precedence over reason, morality over instrumentality, and for the authority of the absolute. Indeed, what she desires, for herself and for others, is contact with moral sources taking a form not unlike the kind of epiphany that Taylor describes. Dominique de Menil was deeply invested in the idea that art, properly framed, could produce just this effect, and it is for this reason that she understood The Menil Collection to be engaged in a project of redemption, for herself, but crucially also for others, and for objects, too.

The Collector's Counter-Model
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Moreover, drawing on the work particularly of Walter Benjamin, collecting itself is revealed as an essentially redemptive impulse insofar as the collector's project is one of the salvage and liberation of objects. Contrary to the critiques of collecting that draw attention to the act of collecting as one in which objects are wrenched from their original circumstances and meanings and deprived of their use-value, Benjamin compellingly evokes the collector's counter-model, wherein the collection rescues and consecrates its constituent objects. Benjamin characterizes the redemption of objects as "perhaps the most hidden motive of one who collects" (Benjamin quoted in Holdengr&#x000E4;ber 1992: 112). Paul Holdengr&#x000E4;ber elaborates on Benjamin's insight here:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The great collector sets himself another Sisyphean task, the utopian and doomed duel with and against dispersion. This "struggle against dispersion," perhaps, one of many possible responses to a world in disarray, dispersed, whereby the collector is "moved" to take things in for repair, provide shelter, and thereby see himself as saving the destitute things of this world, cannot, he knows, last. It is the collector's hope that if he does not find immortality, his collection will, for things so patiently assembled should remain housed under the same roof.

This, of course, stands in stark contrast to Robert Musil's biting characterization of the alienation inherent in the commodification of relationships between persons and objects.

At home these men's works [Kant, Schiller, and Goethe] were kept in the bookcase with green glass panes in Papa's study, and Torless knew this bookcase was never opened except to display its contents to a visitor.

When in "Unpacking My Library" Benjamin asserts, "to a book collector, you see, the true freedom of all books is somewhere on his shelves" (1982: 60), he sees objects liberated from such perfunctory relations of acquisition, re-enchanted through the engulfing intimacy of possession.
</p>

<p>
Didier Maleuvre makes a gesture toward historicizing the character of what he calls the "entanglement of subject and object found only in ownership" (Maleuvre 1999: 97).
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Bourgeois mentality in its early phase valued accumulation and ownership as the mark of social fulfillment. The early bourgeois subject saw the world in terms of possession and non-possession. It never occurs to Robinson Crusoe that the island on which he has just been stranded can be anything but his dominion. He relates to his objective environment first and foremost as an owner, thereby transforming it into an extension of himself as subject. That is why an attack on any part of the kingdom was construed as an attack on the king's body, that is, against the sacredness of the subject-object. By contrast, the owner in advanced capitalism is a mere plenipotentiary. From the president of a democratic nation to the private homeowner, the individual is just a <i>manager</i> of resources that, objectively defined, can be passed on to the next competent person. No longer to be eternally possessed

And of course this is precisely the circumstance of objects in most public collections. Indeed a possessive relation to the objects of the collection on the part of museum professionals or trustees is likely to be considered unseemly.
</p>

<p>
It is for this reason that Benjamin observes that while "public collections may be less objectionable socially and more useful academically than private collections," it is in private collections that "the objects get their due" (Benjamin 1982: 67). And surely Benjamin would include donor museums in this latter category, insofar as they assert the singular possessive vision of the collector and convey an air of the enduring permanence of that vision.
</p>

<p>
Whereas civic collections tend to be defined by their bequests and by the shifting agendas of their various directors, The Menil Collection has always conveyed the impression of a supervening identity&#x02014;if only articulable in terms of a certain singularity of vision. In this respect, as in others, The Menil Collection has been considerably more like a private collection than a public one. Historically, it has not been forced to accommodate the disparate interests of the trustees, who in civic collections must always be mollified lest they withdraw their support or dismiss the director, as so often happens. Right up until her death at the close of 1997, Dominique de Menil served as president of the Menil Foundation under which The Menil Collection operates and the board had largely been constituted by family members and personal associates of long standing who had a deep understanding of her project or were at least willing to defer to it. And while the Collection certainly has accepted gifts of works, most notably perhaps from artists and dealers with whom they have worked over the years, as well as from others with personal associations with the de Menil family, it had felt no obligation to accept gifts that it considered inappropriate or undesirable. Moreover, donors offered pieces fully cognizant, it would seem, of the extent to which their contribution would be subsumed by the "Menil vision;" gifts were seldom acknowledged on Menil labeling and the names of major donors to the museum were discretely inscribed in stone in Michael Heizer's <i>Charmstone </i> [<a href="#8">re 8</a>] that is installed outside of the building, consistent with what Walter Hopps, The Menil Collection's inaugural director, described as its policy of not naming donors within the museum itself.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  With the opening of the building in 1987, the transformation from a private to a public collection was officially complete, though in 1993, Paul Winkler, the museum's director, described it with evident satisfaction as still having "the identity of a private collection" (quoted in Kalil 1993: 24).
</p>

<p>
Now, some eight years since the death of the founder, the composition of the board has changed considerably, the now institutionally persuasive planning and development department has altered the terrain of benefactions, and since Paul Winkler's resignation as director and board member in 1999, there has been a less resolute position taken in response to potential donors. Thus far, however, this shift has been modest in its apparent effects. And certainly attention to the endowment and recognition of the need to encourage donors is by no means a new phenomenon for The Menil Collection.

Permanence

<p class="noIndent">
In her later life, indeed right up until her death in her ninetieth year, Dominique de Menil became increasingly concerned with formalizing the management structures of The Menil Collection, bureaucratizing and depersonalizing what had hitherto been a resolutely 'familial' mode of organization. And while she had historically occupied the role of patron rather than recipient, she became now anxious to ensure the adequacy of the museum's endowment. The Menil Collection found itself, under the urging of the development specialist hired in the midst of this anxiety, having to demonstrate to potential donors its fiscal responsibility, read through the trope of efficiency. This imperative, however, runs counter to the excessive economy of care that has contributed significantly to the poetics of The Menil Collection. The scrupulous attention to presentation, the prestigious but expensive guest speakers, and the value placed on the meticulous, yet slow, realization of ambitious projects all became luxuries that could no longer be sustained, despite these characteristics being cited over and over as integral to the Menil aesthetic. </p>

What was taking precedence here over the character of the institution itself was, of course, another aspect of permanence that is concerned with the mortality of the collector. Insofar as the collection can be understood as a technology by which a coherent and enduring self might be constituted, it also gives material form to its inevitably contingent character&#x02014;it raises the specter of dispersion. The collection is a means 

<b></b>

of self-definition and stabilization, offering the prize of transcendence, while it is at once also an object of deep anxiety. In order to ameliorate this anxiety, the collector looks to securing the integrity of the collection. In this sense, Holdengr&#x000E4;ber notes, "The collector's struggle against dispersion" is not concerned solely with the redemption of objects, but is also, and perhaps centrally, "a struggle against time where the collecting subject seeks to attain through the collection 'victory over transcendence'" (Holdengr&#x000E4;ber 1992: 127).
</p>

<p>
This paradoxical character of the collection, simultaneously promising unity just as it threatens dissolution, lays the ground for a further contradiction with which The Menil Collection continues to struggle. In order to secure its long-term disposition, and thereby to secure the transcendent self of the collector, it is pressed to submit to precisely the imperatives of modernity that it has sought to overcome.
</p>

<p>
Certainly the most striking example of this was the hitherto unimaginable laying off of seventeen people just three weeks before Christmas in 1994. Among those whose positions were terminated were security guards and administrative and professional staff. Many had been working for Dominique de Menil for many years, at the Rice Museum, or for the Menil Foundation out of its offices in the various spare bedrooms and converted garages at the de Menil residence. Some had formerly worked for Schlumberger. The personal impact for those who found themselves without work was of course devastating, but it seemed all the worse to them and to those who remained because it had never been anticipated. Indeed, such a rationalization was "unthinkable." Menil operations had never employed such a model. It is true, however, that people had, over recent years, felt a change in the institution, recognition of which was typically expressed in the form of nostalgic narratives of a more energetic and integrated organization. But the lay-offs definitively drew an end to any identification with what had warmly been described as the familial organization of the institution.
</p>

<p>
The lay-offs were announced just weeks after the appointment of Dominique de Menil's goddaughter Susan Barnes to a new position as Chief Operating Officer of the Menil Foundation. Although her role was subject to a good deal of speculation, it became clear that her primary task was to secure the long-term disposition of The Menil Collection through increasing its endowment and rationalizing its practices in order to reduce operating costs. In this endeavor she joined Julie Gibbs, a development specialist hired just months before in conjunction with the 1994 launching of an endowment drive. Their task was an unenviable one, since they had been called, on the one hand, to overcome the widely held perception of wealth that had worked against a perception of need while, on the other hand, refraining from disrupting the appearance of permanence. Certainly, their internal rationalizations inevitably ran counter to much that had characterized The Menil Collection.
</p>

<p>
But despite the quiet advance of various forms of rationalization at The Menil Collection its intimate artifice had remained remarkably intact right up until Dominique de Menil's death. Indeed it has prevailed beyond that, but anxiety mounts for those who are invested in its resilience.

Self Possession

</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
We have seen the collector here employing the museum to further, among other things, her project of self-fashioning, crafting the appearance of an enduring and singular vision, and in so doing producing the impression of the collector as an autonomous agent producing the conditions for her own transcendence. While self-fashioning may take the appearance of an expression of autonomy, Stephen Greenblatt, however, in his study of Renaissance practices of self-fashioning, showed that "fashioning oneself and being fashioned by cultural institutions . . . were inseparably intertwined." Indeed, every moment of "apparently autonomous self-fashioning" turned out to be "not an epiphany of identity freely chosen but a cultural artifact" (1980: 256). This insight is, of course, now a commonplace. I reiterate it here not to draw attention to the extent to which selves are "cultural artifacts" but to address instead the crafting of the appearance of the self's autonomy. The donor museum, particularly in the exemplary form of The Menil Collection, I have claimed, has the peculiar ability to convey a sense of the collector as a self marked by individuality and personal distinction. And at The Menil Collection the particular character of this distinction confers a kind of moral authority that furthers the redemptive project of the collection.
</p>

<p>
That the prerogatives of wealth that are so deeply imbedded in the identity and practices of The Menil Collection rest upon oil money, that from the outset the museum has been the recipient of considerable financial support from other foundations,<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  and that Dominique de Menil's aesthetic authority is underwritten by a deference to her French aristocratic origins, are always underplayed in the narratives of the Collection. Instead, what are repeatedly foregrounded are Dominique de Menil's preoccupation with spirituality; the moral worthiness of her modesty; her finely calibrated aesthetic sensibilities; and her humanitarian commitments. Each of these registers of eminence is taken up as a sign of her distinction and thereby as an expression of autonomy. They have long been established through press coverage of Dominique de Menil's activities, but they have their most authoritative articulation in the form of her various public projects. Houston was a city in which she and her husband could make a difference. They shepherded its burgeoning interest in modern art, lent their financial and social capital to the civil rights movement, and did much to fashion Houston's cultural institutions. Indeed, they extended their curatorial practices to the city itself. Together these commitments established a remarkably coherent expression of a unified self. But it is not only a unified self that was made possible but a remarkably unassailable one. In each of the domains of eminence I have identified and throughout the philosophical underpinnings of Dominique de Menil's projects is a sustained obscuring of the social structures of difference and a notable marking of personal distinction.
</p>

<p>
What is at stake here in the artifice of the autonomous self achieved through possession is, as Greenblatt points out, the desire, or rather, "the overwhelming need" to sustain the illusion that one is the principal maker of one's own identity (Greenblatt 1980: 257). But of course this is a distinctively modern impulse, insofar as it expresses a commitment to the freedom of the self. Throughout Dominique de Menil's commentaries on her self and her projects is a pervasive marking of personal distinction, 

<b></b>

rendered as a kind of cosmopolitanism,<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  in lieu of recognition of structures of difference and privilege. And this effacement of difference is expressed at the heart of her project, in seeking remedy for the disenchantments of modernity through recourse to sensibility, rather than through the more conventionally political project of the reform of social structure. Crucially, moreover, this distinction is asserted as a mark of one's freedom. In the modern world, Alain Touraine argues, "the criterion of the good is the individual's ability to control his or her actions and situation, to see and experience modes of behavior as components in a personal life history, to see himself or herself as an actor. <i>The Subject is an individual's will to act and to be recognized as an actor</i>" (Touraine 1995: 207).<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The moral project of The Menil Collection and of Dominique de Menil herself, however, extends well beyond the modern injunction to exercise self-agency that Touraine identifies. While, as I have argued, The Menil Collection serves as an exemplary instance of the donor museum's ability to convey a sense of the collector as a self marked by individuality and personal distinction, in the case of The Menil Collection this self-fashioning participates in a more expansive moral vision. Seeking to enable access to what Taylor characterizes as the impulse to find "moral sources outside of the self," The Menil Collection binds the sacred with the modern in its attempt to create the conditions for redemption.
</p>

<p>
What is to become of The Menil Collection in the absence of the collector? As long as Dominique de Menil was alive, the artifice of intimacy was maintained not only within the museum's public spaces, but it permeated "behind-the-scenes" activities also and imbued the sensibilities of the staff. As the years have passed since Dominique de Menil's death, there has been considerable attrition of museum staff at all levels. As a consequence, the culture of the museum has shifted, with more recently hired personnel adopting a more strictly professional relationship to the collection. They have become its stewards rather than its owners. And as Maleuvre notes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
With the decline of ownership comes also an increased alienation between subject and object. Something that may account for the aloofness of art in the modern museum is the fact that it does not belong to anyone. . . . No doubt the emancipation of art from ownership means that art can begin to stand on its own, its artistic integrity no longer overshadowed by the collector's prestige. That art is not to be "had" agrees with the emancipatory thrust of art. On the other hand, the separation of art from ownership contributed to the autonomization of art and the frigid division of subject and object. Today the subject no longer has a place in the space of art, except one that is strongly marked by exteriority. Looking at art has become synonymous with being an intruder in the realm of art.

<p>
As I have argued, it is this alienation that The Menil Collection has sought to overcome in the interest of furthering Dominique de Menil's project of redemption. And the Collection endeavored to achieve this through the creation of the intimate artifice of possession. But this raised the question of whether this effect could be sustained now that Dominique de Menil is no longer alive and the operation of the museum has 

<b></b>

come to be understood more in terms of "stewardship" of the collection rather than "ownership," along with its concomitant formalization of relationships. And indeed, we saw signs of this toward the end of Dominique de Menil's life in response to the financial pressures that she faced in her attempt to secure the ongoing integrity of the project. As the collector anticipates a time when she will no longer be able to hold her collection together either conceptually or financially, her priority is to formalize legal and financial arrangements that will ensure the persistence of the collection in the future. Dominique de Menil was unequivocal on this matter. The Menil signature may find itself attenuated but sooner that than its erasure.
</p>

<p>
But, in truth, The Menil Collection has struggled with this since its inauguration. In the transformation of the private collection into a public museum, The Menil Collection has found itself subject to the imperatives of rationalization, to the very forces of modernity to which it has sought to serve as a counter-model. To manage a large, high-status public collection requires attention, if not adherence, to codified procedures, professional specialization, the formalization of human relations, and the strictures of efficiency and accountancy. Insofar as this contradiction was recognized, it overwhelmingly provoked a redoubling of efforts to mitigate its effect, to ensure that the seamlessness of The Menil Collection's intimate artifice was sustained. To the extent that it has succumbed to managerial stewardship, there will be no such effort to overcome its alienating effects.
</p>

<p>
This may be the fate of all donor museums that find themselves in the sway of managerial stewardship, as Maleuvre's argument suggests, but my intent here is not to articulate regret. Rather, it is to examine the manner in which a possessive relationship between persons and objects imbues those relationships with a deeply affecting density in the context of which, to reiterate Gell's characterization, the agency of art objects is intensified . But rather than following Gell in eschewing attention to the operation of aesthetics in this process, I argue that at The Menil Collection it is through the crafting of its seamless aesthetic of intimacy that a possessive relationship is quite intentionally fostered. Attention to aesthetic processes is, therefore, central to this analysis and suggests the possibility of a museum that is not "a lesson in compliance to authority and conformity" (Maleuvre 1999: 4), but which seeks to engage its public in a manner that has alternative ethical and political entailments.

A partial catalogue of the objects in the collection may be found in <i>The Menil Collection: A Selection From the Paleolithic to the Modern Era</i> . Compiled by Menil Collection personnel for the inauguration of the Menil Collection, that is, for the transformation of the collection into a museum open to the public, it was published by the Menil Collection in association with Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York. An account of the acquisition and restoration of the frescoes can be found in <i>A Byzantine Masterpiece Recovered, the Thirteenth-Century Murals of Lysi, Cyprus,</i> that was also published under the auspices of the Menil Collection (Carr and Morrocco 1991). <i>The Rothko Chapel: An Act of Faith</i>, published by the Rothko Chapel Foundation, offers a narrative of the planning and realization of the Rothko Chapel (Barnes 1989), as does <i>The Rothko Chapel: The Slow Arrow of Beauty</i> (Saenz 1980). <i>Sanctuary: The Spirit In/Of Architecture, </i>edited by Kim Shkapich and Susan de Menil , addresses each of these three projects, asserting the linkages between their architectural and spiritual qualities.

That their critique of modernity was pursued in concert with their progressivist enthusiasms distinguishes their project from the kind of nostalgic anti-modern tendencies that Luk&#x000E1;cs  described as "romantic anti-capitalism." While the de Menils, like Lukacs' romantic anti-capitalists, regret the loss of the personal and immediate character of communal social organization, they do not long nostalgically for a return to pre-modern society. Rather, they imagine modernism itself as a means of rehabilitating the modern.

This project was developed around the design of the churches of Assy and Audincourt, and of the chapels of Ronchamp and Vence, and in his negotiation of highly controversial commissions for artworks for these sanctuaries from leading modernist artists, among them Matisse, L&#x000E9;ger, Rouault, and Le Corbusier. Later, in the late 40s and until his death in 1954, Couturier went on to elaborate an account of these initiatives as the co-editor of the Catholic review <i>L'Art Sacr&#x000E9;</i>, in which he defends his judgments in the context of arguments concerning the relation between art and spirituality or faith, in so doing elaborating a broader treatise on the character of the aesthetic.

Hazlitt goes further to argue that possession is to be desired in preference to mere ownership insofar as ownership confines one to a limited array of objects, whereas possession carries no such limitation. "It is not we who should envy them . . . but they who should envy us the true and exclusive enjoyment of it" (Hazlitt 1991:194).

Here I use the translation of Paul Holdengr&#x000E4;ber  rather than that of Harry Zohn in the collected volume of Benjamin's essays, <i>Illuminations</i> .

French philosophical formulations of the self vis-&#x000E0;-vis the nation, articulated in the midst of French revolutionary struggles over the meaning of the state and citizenship, offer a sense of what is at stake in this use of the term. The <i>"philosophes</i>," writes Liah Greenfeld in her discussion of the emergence of French nationhood, sought refuge from their "unremitting self-criticism" of France in cosmopolitanism:

[They] were above particularistic self-content and refused to allow an accident of birth to dictate to them what their commitments should be. . . .

They leave it to the vulgar, to those who, having no personal glory, have to content themselves with the glory of their countrymen ".

A certain extravagance of expression notwithstanding, this notion of cosmopolitanism seems quite apt, since it allows of a degree of moral certitude and authority that is consistent with even ecumenical registers of faith. This form of transcendent cosmopolitanism stands in distinction to the more self-conscious, self-critical cultural relativist sense that is often associated with the notion of cosmopolitanism.

While Touraine makes a sharp distinction between the person as 'self' and as 'subject' it is his usage of subject here that aligns with what we have been referring to as the self. See Touraine 1995, Chapter 3.

First a disclaimer of my title, itself a disclaimer. My title should have proposed&#x02014;"This is not a <i>Hollywood</i> movie." The distinction will later prove to be more important than it might initially appear. For now, it may be sufficient to state the rather obvious case that <i>Ulysses </i>possesses none of the indispensable elements of a Hollywood feature film. Its narrative captures no idiosyncratic, star-making gesture like James Cagney's shrug or Jack Nicholson's smirk, no signature trait like Bette Davis's eyes or Marilyn Monroe's shimmying walk, in which an entire screen personality seems radiantly condensed. The most <i>Ulysses</i> might offer us in the way of a quasi-cinematic moment in which character is illuminated through gesture would be Buck Mulligan's stately plump gait or Stephen Dedalus's lordly way with his ashplant. Nor does <i>Ulysses</i> abound in scenes depicting graphic, impulsive, overmastering and dauntingly athletic sex, except perhaps that which takes place off stage.
</p>

<p>
In fact I could risk an excruciating, but not facile pun and pronounce that by established conventions of Hollywood moviemaking <i>Ulysses</i> is a "reel" disappointment.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Admittedly, such standards are the least pertinent measures for gauging the extent to which <i>Ulysses</i> approximates, either in its style or form, a "cinematic" work. Still, the homonymic identity between reel and real may help us sort out the ways in which <i>Ulysses</i>'s modernism has been creditably compared to the modernism of (non-Hollywood) film. Born with the advent of modernity and its new technologies of vision, this pun on "real" recalls the points of contact and similarity between film and literature particularly in their representations of the physical world. That text is a cognate for textile and derives from the Latin <i>texere</i>, to weave, 

<b></b>

is an etymology long familiar and often invoked by literary critics. Less attention has been paid to the verbal origins of "reel" in the Greek <i>krekein</i>,to weave. Text and reel, then, formally resemble each other as <i>woven </i>artifacts<i>, </i>interlacing the real into a fabric of illusion, a ribbon of dreams<i>. </i>How much, then, does it matter that the text is woven of words, the reel of celluloid strips? Do the author and the auteur, both master weavers, have equal standing or do they wield separate authority in fashioning simulacra of reality? These questions have been asked before, but they seem to me worth returning to, especially since they have never been definitely answered. They linger as agents of unrest in the disputed territory of "the real," over which many of the fiercest aesthetic and ideological battles of modernity have been and continue to be waged.
</p>

<p>
Two pronouncements&#x02014;one dogmatic, the other legalistic&#x02014;on <i>Ulysses'</i>s artistic status illustrate the cultural reach and ideological stakes of these battles. Both link their judgment of <i>Ulysses</i> to its technological and aesthetic kinship with the visual regime of cinema. The first is Karl Radek's indictment of <i>Ulysses</i> at the 1934 Congress of Soviet Writers. Summing up the contentious debate on Joyce's "decadent" and individualist formalism, Radek called <i>Ulysses</i> "a heap of dung, teeming with worms and photographed by a motion picture camera through a microscope."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Ulysses is alleged to be the work of a myopic and fetid naturalism. Its narrative distorts reality and mishandles technologies of vision by moving, like a movie camera, from one magnified and putrid image of verminous life to another. Eisenstein defended <i>Ulysses</i> against Radek's condemnation with this brilliant, but at the time unavailing retort:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Radek's critique of Joyce was based essentially on one point. He said that we don't need things in such microscopic detail. We don't see that way, such phenomena don't exist. But that criticism is as if a person at some first-aid station saw an enlargement of something seen under the microscope on the wall and said: "Why is this necessary? After all, microbes aren't that big. After all, you don't see all that in real life." Do you understand the mistake here? The thing is that you have to study those charts in order to be able to know those invisible bacteria, those invisible elements, in order to possess them.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Eisenstein not only saw Radek's mistake, one common to fervid advocates of socialist realism, he corrected it by personally consulting&#x02014;and inducing his students to study&#x02014;the Joycean charts recording the invisible life of the capitalist West.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  We shall see in a moment how he profited from his researches into Joyce's method of making the invisible elements of our human world conspicuously visible.
</p>

<p>
For now, let us turn to another campaign mounted against <i>Ulysses&#x02014;</i>the legal action broughtagainst it in the U.S. for its alleged obscenity. The Honorable John M. Woolsey is rightly celebrated for his decision of 6 December 1933, determining that <i>Ulysses</i> could not be deemed obscene. But Woolsey should also be honored as one of the first, and certainly the shrewdest of <i>Ulysses</i>'s early readers, to note how the very technique that signaled the novel's radical modernity&#x02014;the stream of consciousness in which the inner lives of characters was rendered with a startling and often scandalous precision&#x02014;found its companionable double not in the lyric or the prose poem, where the re and impressions of the perceiving and experiencing "I" conventionally dominate, 

<b></b>

but in the art of film, the art of surfaces devoted to picturing external reality. As Woolsey reads&#x02014;or sees&#x02014;<i>Ulysses</i>:

Joyce has attempted&#x02014;it seems to me, with astonishing success&#x02014;to show how the screen of consciousness with its ever-shifting kaleidoscopic impressions carries, as it were on a plastic palimpsest, not only what is in the focus of each man's observation of the actual things about him, but also in a penumbra zone residua of past impressions, some recent and some drawn up by association from the domain of the subconscious. He shows how each of these impressions affects the life and behavior of the character which he is describing.

	What he seeks is not unlike the result of a double or, if that is possible, a multiple exposure on a cinema film which would give a clear foreground with a background visible but somewhat blurred and out of focus in varying degrees.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
Woolsey is writing before the invention of deep focus which will eliminate that background blur and bring the foreground and background into reciprocal focus (hence relation to each other). Nevertheless, Woolsey apprehends the way film's ability to render multiple exposures might serve as an analogue for the way impressions and thoughts are projected through the palimpsest of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Now while these were and perhaps still are in some quarters serious issues of dispute, I am not at all interested in adjudicating whether <i>Ulysses</i> represents modern life as a verminous dung heap or as a plastic palimpsest in which dreams, memories and present impressions flit in and out of focus in a dazzling kaleidoscopic display. I am more intrigued by how the radical experimentalism of the modern novel found itself so quickly identified with the newest of the human arts. To what extent does the power of the motion picture camera to make the cinematic image appear or disappear, reduce or enlarge, approach or withdraw, resemble the multiple perspectives, the sometimes conflicting but related points of view of novelistic narration? Is montage, the cinematic succession of images, a visual analogue for the discontinuous and scrambled chronologies, typical of modern narrative, that want to dispense with the realist codes of storytelling? How far can we take the resemblance between literature's many-layered representations of human consciousness and cinema's depth of field, its power, singled out by Judge Woolsey, to superimpose, overexpose, successively repeat and abruptly erase images on a celluloid ribbon?
</p>

<p>
These questions should vex us more than they currently do. "Cinematographic form" has joined Joseph Frank's "spatial form" in the critic's lexicon for describing the narrative formations unique to modernist fiction, where it continues to rest, relatively unchallenged, on its laurels.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Occasionally a voice is raised in emphatic objection to the perceived resemblances between cinematic and literary expression. One of the most forceful and authoritative objectors was Italo Calvino, who in terse but pointed answers to questions posed by <i>Cahiers du Cinema </i>for an issue on the relation of film to the novel<i>, </i>insisted that film has closer ties to the oral tradition than to written narratives.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Calvino went on to enumerate the radical differences in the fundamental techniques of film and narrative. One defining difference for Calvino was in their use of detail: literature "ignores all the techniques that the camera uses to enlarge a detail or a face to 

<b></b>

underscore a feeling or to indicate its relation to the whole" ("FER," 1532). Moreover, film has a superior power to vary the proportions of objects and our distance to them, but primarily as syntactic means to indicate their privileged place in the succession of images. It is a syntax poor in the "affective connotations" (<i>connotations affectives</i>) in which literature, with its power to create mystery and pathos, excels. On the basis of these comparisons, Calvino's verdict is confident and uncompromising: the techniques of a genuinely "cinematic" cinema, he concludes, are not at all comparable to those of literature. In fact, the cinema and the novel "have nothing to teach and nothing to learn from each other" (<i>entre cinema et roman, il n'ya rien &#x000E0; enseigner et rien &#x000E0; apprendre</i>) ("FER," 1533).
</p>

<p>
Calvino's views are not now commonly held nor, as far as I can tell, are they especially well known. They can be faulted for ignoring the possibility that modern writers not only went to the movies, but may have been inspired by cinema to devise new techniques of visual description or narrative ordering. As critics with as different critical outlooks and methods as P. Adams Sitney, Keith Cohen and, more recently, Susan McCabe have shown, modern writers artistically responded in various and imaginatively compelling ways to the new compositional possibilities the movies offered.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Keith Williams, who has studied the relation of Joyce's literary techniques to early cinema, including his brief stint as manager of Dublin's first movie theater, the Volta, calls our attention to many of the ways in which <i>Ulysses</i> in particular reflected the emerging grammar of film. In <i>Ulysses</i>, he writes, "objects are increasingly seen to have a life of their own, from the automatic printing press Bloom watches in 'Aeolus,' to fully animated objects in 'Circe,' like the soap which rises into the sky, singing. The 'morphing' devices and space-time conjuring of <i>Ulysses'</i>s mocalyptic climax move beyond the M&#x000E9;li&#x000E8;sque possibilities of stop-motion trickery into parallels with graphic animators. Arguably, as in the case of Bloom's bodily deformations, they even anticipate today's computer-generated digital imaging."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Still, while <i>Ulysses</i> may indeed offer parallels with, and anticipations of, modern technologies of vision, it also offers evidence of the limitations of the relationship between film and novel as companionable, if not exactly sister arts. I wish, then, to take Calvino's objections to heart and snipe at the boldness with which we rhetorically cross the generic borders between film and novel like bounty hunters after quarry living openly in neighboring territory. My own rhetoric may sound somewhat hostile, but my intent is actually diplomatic: to negotiate a truce between literature and film that recognizes the rights and limits of their respective domains. Such diplomatic intent motivates Lessing when he proposed in <i>Laoco&#x000F6;n</i>, his classic treatise on the respective limits of the visual and verbal arts, that painting and poetry "should be like two just and friendly neighbors, neither of whom indeed is allowed to take unseemly liberties in the heart of the other's domain, but who exercise mutual forbearance on the borders, and effect a peaceful settlement for all the petty encroachments which circumstances may compel either to make in haste on the rights of the other."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 
</p>

<br /><br />

<p class="noIndent">
The temptation to encroach on neighboring territory is heightened by the historical and aesthetic fact that both modern novels and modern cinema, whether high or 

<b></b>

low, avant-garde or mainstream, aim at conditioning, or rather reconditioning, our perceptual apparatus according to the new requirements of modernity itself. Of particular importance for modern visuality in both its cinematic and literary expressions was the accelerated pace of modern life. The sheer speed with which things happen in modern society often means that visual phenomena can disappear before they can be fully registered by the eye or remarked and interpreted by our consciousness. Visually, modernism has been fascinated by the spontaneity, but also the disorienting randomness of the image, incident or event as it unfolds before an eye not yet accustomed to selecting, focusing and interpreting what it so flittingly sees. Nothing exemplifies this fascination quite like cinema, nor so opportunistically exploits it. In <i>Prater Violet</i> , Christopher Isherwood's narrator, a novelist recruited to write a scenario, discovers that it is the pace rather than the content or "look" of film that accounts for its singular beauty&#x02014;and diabolic allure:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The whole <i>beauty</i> of the film . . . is that it has a certain fixed speed. The way you see it is mechanically conditioned I mean, take a painting&#x02014;you can just glance at it, or you can stare at the left-hand top corner for half an hour. Same thing with a book. The author can't stop you from skimming it, or starting at the last chapter and reading backwards. The point is, you choose your approach. When you go into a cinema, it's different. There's the film and you have to look at it as the director wants you to look at it. He makes his points, one after another, and he allows you a certain number of seconds or minutes to grasp each one. If you miss anything, he won't repeat himself, and won't stop to explain. He can't. He's started something, and he has to go through with it . . . You see, the film is really like a sort of infernal machine.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
This experience of visual compulsion is new to modernity. However pleasurable it may be to "watch" a film, the fact that we are forced to look in a way predetermined by another is what prompted and justifies Isherwood's image of the film as an infernal machine. That a machine <i>could</i> be infernal is a romantic idea given a new application and urgency by the new technologies of vision. Film may appear uncanny in its power to compel us to look at certain things in a certain way at a predetermined speed. Watching a film unrolling at its own pace leaves us powerless to do anything but watch, close our eyes, or look or walk away&#x02014;the last three forlorn options at best. Even the director, insists Isherwood, feels compelled to go "through with" something whose motions, once the film has begun, he can no longer suspend, alter or in any way control.
</p>

<p>
Not so the novel, as Isherwood cagily suggests by italicizing the word <i>beauty</i>, thus visually calling attention to the different ways print works to catch our eye. However baleful the images depicted in or circulating through a novel, however possible, even probable it is that a lubricious narrative can succeed in corrupting its readers, the novel cannot exercise the same infernal control over consciousness that a movie can. According to this logic, a reader, unlike the moviegoer, never loses the freedom to regulate and monitor his own responses, to stop, pause, go forward or backwards across the expanse of words. The abstract "beauty" of narrative, unlike that of film, is partly an organic one; no mechanism determines the speed at which its attractions are made available to us. A reader may read at his own pace, at her own will&#x02014;she may skim or 

<b></b>

linger over passages; he may go forwards, skip ahead, go backwards, leave off in mid-sentence and resume at a time of his own liking or convenience. The advent of video and dvd recording has now made it possible to "read" a film in the same way we read a book, but this freedom is gained at the expense of enchantment.
</p>

<p>
This difference between our experience of reading a book and seeing a film may strike us as too obvious to be worth remarking, but those moderns who worked in both media thought and knew better. Director Josef von Sternberg, who acknowledged the camera as "the pen of our craft," noted that "not many . . . are able to read what is written; for the story must be read at once, unlike a book, which can be reread and studied until it is understood." Even if we modify von Sternberg's absolutism to allow that the film may be reviewed and studied, we cannot dispute his memorable aphorism for the film's refusal to heed any call to prolong or arrest the flow of its images: "The legend on the screen does not tarry."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
It is odder, then, than is often admitted that Joyce, who along with Proust and Woolf was the modern novelist most intent on creating a new narrative syntax through his experimentations with language and time, entertained the idea of making a movie out of <i>Ulysses.</i><sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> Despite his reservations about whether <i>Ulysses</i> could be filmed at all, he did not discourage Stuart Gilbert from attempting a scenario and, more seriously, talked to Sergei Eisenstein about the prospects of translating <i>Ulysses </i>into film.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> Eisenstein, whose own copy of <i>Ulysses</i> was heavily annotated and marked in the manner of a shooting script, was especially interested in the potential of the interior monologue to make cinema the first fully expressive and synesthetic art.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  This project could only be actualized, Eisenstein understood, after the advent of sound, since only sound could naturalistically extend the repertoire of filmic effects to interior monologue.
</p>

<p>
Eisenstein had initially hoped to realize his dream of translating Joycean stream of consciousness to the screen while making a Hollywood film. This is the story, for those who are not acquainted with it. When Paramount assigned Eisenstein to direct a film version of Dreiser's <i>American Tragedy</i>, Eisenstein, who had been thinking about how to translate Joyce's "inner monologue" into filmic language, saw his chance. He was particularly concerned to get "inside" the consciousness of his protagonist Clyde at the climactic moment when he is about to consummate the murder he has planned so carefully but, at the last moment, cannot execute. Rather than rely on the actor's ability to convey indecision, Eisenstein, fervent advocate of montage as both dynamic and conflictual, envisaged a treatment that would penetrate "inside" Clyde while never losing sight of the "outside" of the drama, that twisted skein of erotic and social longings that has brought Clyde to this desperate pass. Having settled on "an outer presentation" of what was passing through Clyde's mind before the fatal "accident," Eisenstein dispenses with "the whole arsenal of knitted vows, rolling eyes, hard breathing contorted postures, stony faces, or close-ups of convulsively working hands" as "inadequate for the expression of those subtleties of the inner struggle in all its nuances." This is how he broadly conceived of such a treatment: "Aurally and visually must be set down the feverish <i>race of thoughts</i>, intermittently with the outer actuality&#x02014;the boat, the girl sitting opposite him, his own actions." So it was, he explains, that "[t]he form of the 

<b></b>

inner monologue was born" ("CIT," 103). Eisenstein, of course, is aware that he is celebrating a somewhat belated birth, since he acknowledges that Joyce among others had preceded him in "abolishing the distinction between subject and object in stating the hero's re-experience in a crystallized form" ("CIT," 104). Still he maintains, with an appreciation that Lessing might applaud for the unique expressiveness of his medium, that "Even literature is powerless in this domain" ("CIT," 103).
</p>

<p>
Eisenstein then proceeds to elaborate his newborn vision of how film might render consciousness at a point of highest excitation, a point where it is most fully active in perceiving and responding to stimuli coming from both within and without. However much he admired Joyce's ability to achieve an "almost physiological palpability," he nevertheless concludes that "Even Joyce is not up to the task." Eisenstein regarded Joyce's achievement as belonging to the realm of the ultra lyrical. The ultra lyrical, according to Eisenstein, was a mode that allowed Joyce to reconstruct the most intimate passage of the inner logic of feeling. But according to Eisenstein, Joyce's physiological organization of the emotions comes at a price&#x02014;"the entire dissolution of the foundation of literary diction, the entire decomposition of the literary method itself."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  And if Eisenstein was made for anything, he was made for method. For cinematic method, for montage. Hence the creative excitement he felt in devising the montage lists for <i>An American Tragedy</i>. This is how Eisenstein describes the thought-images&#x02014;the montage lists&#x02014;he had envisaged with something like wonder:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Like thought, they would sometimes proceed with visual images. With sound. Synchronized or non-synchronized. Then as sounds. Formless. Or with sound-images: with objectively representational sounds . . .  
<p class="blockquote">
	Then suddenly, definite intellectually formulated words&#x02014;as intellectual and dispassionate as pronounced words. With a black screen, a rushing imageless visuality. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Then a passionate disconnected speech, nothing but nouns. Or nothing but verbs. Then interjections. With zigzags of aimless shapes, whirling along with these in synchronization. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Then racing visual images over complete silence. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Then linked with polyphonic sounds. Then polyphonic images, then both at once. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Then interpolated into the outer course of action, then interpolating elements of the outer action into the inner monologue.  
<p class="blockquote">
	As if presenting inside the characters the inner play, the conflict of doubts, the explosions of passion, the voice of reason, rapidly or in slow-motion, marking the differing rhythms of one and the other and, at the same time, contrasting with the almost complete absence of outer action: a feverish inner debate behind the stony mask of the face.

Eisenstein envisages here a new cinematic syntax based on the same disintegrating force he ascribes to Joyce's novelistic language of fragments: the associational, sentenceless flow of words, the private shorthand of the mind speaking to itself in a language adapted to personal use; scraps of dialogue, jingles, phrases from ads, even itinerant syllables separated from their stem-words with little hope of regaining their verbal home. But however faithfully this modern syntax is translated to the screen, it appears to us as a completely different language. Speed is the catalytic agent that 

<b></b>

transforms Joyce's stream of language into a feverish synesthetic rush in which various sounds&#x02014;audible but varying in intelligibility and articulateness&#x02014;yield to a silence scored over by images, in which a screen teeming with both representational and abstract images is suddenly overrun by the "imageless visuality" of blackness. Nothing can at once register and withstand this phantasmagoria of sound and image but the human face that, petrified by the inner sensations that threaten to disre and betray it, is converted to a stony mask.
</p>

<p>
The face as mask, reified in a close-up, is a specialty shot of cinema that approaches the iconic power of sculpture or the portrait-bust.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Eisenstein's treatment seems to call upon this resemblance in shooting the face as an immobile screen across which might flicker "all the traces of inward thought and emotion." This was the reality of human face Eisenstein sought to capture through the creative combination and juxtaposition of shots he called montage:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
How fascinating it is to listen to one's own train of thought, particularly in an excited state, in order to catch yourself looking at and listening to your mind. How you talk "to yourself" as distinct from "out of yourself." The syntax of inner speech as distinct from outer speech. The quivering inner words that correspond with the visual images. Contrasts with outer circumstances, how they work reciprocally.

In Eisenstein's attempt to translate the syntax of inner speech we can immediately appreciate how he differs from Dreiser in his representation of what thinking <i>is. </i>Dreiser the naturalist and Eisenstein the modernist each devised different though equally difficult ways to show people thinking&#x02014;or, more accurately, people trying to resist certain thoughts. This is how Dreiser describes Clyde as he contemplates executing his carefully considered plan to kill the pregnant girl who threatens the fulfillment of his American dream:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
He could not do a thing like that&#x02014;hit any one&#x02014;a girl&#x02014;Roberta&#x02014;and when drowning or struggling. Oh, no, no&#x02014;no such thing as that! Impossible. 
<p class="blockquote">
	He took his straw hat and went out, almost before any one heard him <i>think</i>, as who would have phrased it to himself, such horrible, terrible thoughts. He could not and would not think them from now on. He was no such person. And yet&#x02014;and yet&#x02014;these thoughts.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Dreiser's naturalism takes a sudden surreal turn when he describes Clyde's peculiar mental terror at having thoughts that he fears might actually be <i>heard</i>, as if such horrible thoughts were so potent they could dispense with speech altogether and make themselves audible to any passerby. It is almost as if Clyde is horrified that he might find himself at this "moment of action&#x02014;of crisis!" actually to be in a film by Eisenstein, his thoughts audible, their malignity visible to all.
</p>

<p>
Despite his exultation over his creative invention, Eisenstein must have known, as Siegfried Kracauer wryly noted, that the montage lists, however wonderful, "clearly exceeds the framework of the story, however generous the allowance made for it; it 

<b></b>

even exceeds Clyde's own being; what it tends to convey instead is the endless series of circumstances and sensations which close in on Clyde at this particular moment."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Such excesses did not elude the eye of the producers at Paramount, who were understandably alarmed at the treatment and referred the project to Josef von Sternberg. The latter had recently brought Heinrich Mann's <i>Blue Angel</i> to the screen and had launched the career of one of the great screen icons, Marlene Dietrich. When Dreiser sued the studio for its desecrating treatment, a sympathetic von Sternberg wished he had been called to testify on Dreiser's behalf. In his amusing and literate autobiography, <i>Fun in a Chinese Laundry</i>, he offered that "[l]iterature cannot be transferred to the screen without a loss to its values. The visual elements completely revalue the written word" (<i>FCL</i>, 259). Perhaps if he had been called as a witness, Dreiser might have won.
</p>

<p>
Von Sternberg's thoughts on translation and transvaluation brusquely but sensibly recall the difference between literary and cinematic language that Eisenstein thought might be obliterated or transcended. As we might anticipate from his defense of the outraged Dreiser, von Sternberg is a director-auteur with few illusions and very little respect for the intrinsic diction and syntax of his chosen medium as an artist:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

The vocabulary of its language was explicit and fluid, but it could express only that which was given it to absorb. From the beginning, the film camera proved to be a vicious instrument, not easy to manage. It sifted ideas and converted them into moving images. Great ideas were fed into it, were filtered out avidly. The lens of the camera cannot deal with them easily and therefore disdains them. The glass eye accepted the most common and worthless ideas readily and without blinking a shutter. The motion picture camera is not easily controlled; to master it requires a thorough knowledge of its caprice, constant vigilance and disrespect for its normal appetite.

If film is an infernal machine, as Isherwood believed, then the camera is its vicious instrument.
</p>

<p>
D. H. Lawrence, so disdainful of what modern civilization regarded as "normal" appetites, was even more suspicious of the caprice of the camera and its avidity for images. In <i>A Lost Girl</i>, in which a movie theater res prominently, a keen filmgoer praises the power of film to reproduce life so instantaneously that "you <i>know</i> everything at a glance. . . . It's instruction, you take it all in at a glance, all you need to know, and it lasts you for a week. You can get to know everything about people's actual lives from the cinema."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The camera is so efficient in ingesting life that Lawrence likens it to an "utilitarian drain" (<i>LG</i>, 151). A few pages later he continues his disconcerting critique of film, this time through the leader of a theatrical troupe, who seems reconciled to the impending extinction of her own live representations. "The pictures are cheap, and they are easy, and they cost the audience nothing, no feeling of the heart, no appreciation of the spirit, cost them nothing of these. And so they like them, and they don't like us, because they must feel the things we do from the heart, and appreciate them from the spirit. <i>They want it all through the eye, and finished&#x02014;so!</i> Just curiosity, impatient curiosity" (<i>LG</i>, 151, emphasis added). The cheapness of films is, finally, less economic than spiritual. Lawrence's objection to experiencing life "all through the eye" is that it 

<b></b>

finishes life rather than reveals it. In its exclusive appeal to the eye, film empties life of real mystery and so makes no claims on the heart or demands on the spirit.
</p>

<p>
Eisenstein had valiantly fought to subdue the "normal" appetite of the eye for startling images through the artistic and ideological discipline of montage, which he traced to the literary methods of Flaubert. He singled out the "love scene" between Emma and Rodolphe in <i>Madame Bovary</i>, which interlaces the lovers' dialogue with the banal oratory issuing from the square below their balcony, as an instance of the "cross-cutting and word-play" that constitute "montage-thought."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Joyce was one of Flaubert's heirs in the creative use of the juxtapositions and word-plays habitual to "montage-thought," nowhere more exultantly than in <i>Ulysses</i>'s introductory, blatantly parodic key&#x02014;"Stately, plump. . . ." The antinomies of classical and contemporary reality, characters, myths and diction (to name only a few of the elements) are invoked at the novel's beginning, sounding the note of contrast but also of notable, perhaps perilous juxtaposition of opposing or incompatible forms. We should also note that "Stately, plump" thoughts, like stately, plump narratives, may stroll, but never race (a favorite sight in cinema).
</p>

<p>
But to observe and appreciate the limits of this analogy between cinematic and literary uses of juxtaposition, let me isolate only one of many situations that Joyce represents by cross-cutting in and out of a character's mind&#x02014;Bloom in the streets. The streets, as Kracauer was the first to note, are a quintessential cinematic locale. Tracing a genealogy back to Baudelaire, Kracauer shows how the streets are a continuing and obsessive visual domain for cinema. They maintain, he writes, their "interest as a region where the accidental prevails over the providential and happenings in the nature of unexpected incidents are all but the rule" (<i>TF</i>, 62). The street is then the quintessential if not ideal mise-en-scene that promises to disclose the mutual fascination modern film and narrative entertain for the fortuitous, for the random, and for what Kracauer calls the "unstaged" (<i>TF</i>, 60).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
With this is mind, let us revisit Bloom at the point early in the day when he makes one of his forays into the bustling, enticing, but also unwelcoming, often hostile streets of Dublin. I want to catch up with Bloom when he finds himself in the domain of "Lotus Eaters," trafficking in errant images that threaten to obliterate all memory of home. This is a moment, one of many during <i>Ulysses'</i>s long day, when Bloom is recalled from his inner fantasy to the real conditions of Dublin life. The culprit this time is M'Coy, a companion he will soon ditch to keep company with his own vagrant thoughts.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  While amiably conversing with M'Coy about, among other things, Dignam's funeral, Bloom's eye, and the narrative&#x02014;suddenly switches into a highly ocular mode: "Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still, waiting, until the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change" (<i>U</i>, 60).
</p>

<p>
So far narrative indications assume the form of a shot or of narrative anecdote, one that might eventually find its way into the documentary footage of the day or into Bloom's private archive of fetishistic snapshots taken by his mind's eye in the course of a day, indeed throughout his lifetime. The nameless woman is isolated, as if within a visual 

<b></b>

frame, before the door of the hotel, flanked by a man. Is it the narrator or Bloom who poses their possible relationship as a mystery to be solved? Certainly it is a mystery, one that seems narratively to activate Bloom's voice. The "like her" is a phrase that prepares for the transfer from the featureless third person narrator to interior monologue. The ensuing proto-cinematic shot then unrolls in Bloom's distinctive voice: "Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
Stylish is a trigger word that activates the transfer from outer picture to inner commentary. It is as if the third person narrator or sound stage manager had lapsed into a more casual prose, but the word "stylish" introduces and introjects us into Bloom's musing mind: "Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honorable Mrs and Brutus is an honorable man. Possess her once, take the starch out of her" (ibid). At the very point when the handsome lady seems very much about to yield, at least in the fantasy film Bloom, the rough and ready auteur, is directing in his mind, M'Coy yanks the narrative back into the domain of dear dirty Dublin, reporting to Bloom on his latest bender: "&#x02014;I was with Bob Doran in Conway's, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conways we went" (ibid). Bloom, hardly caring where M'Coy was or whom he was drinking with, immediately conflates or confuses the identities and names of M'Coy's chatty anecdote.
</p>

<p>
For a minute the narrative reels&#x02014;pun very much intended&#x02014;to reorient itself so that it may coordinate the simultaneous occurrences of Bloom's interior musing, the external verbal exchange with M'Coy and the scene he is observing. An impersonal narrative voice temporarily takes over for the distracted Bloom to report what is actually happening across the street: "She raised a gloved hand to her hair" (ibid). Then we switch immediately to M'Coy's maddening chatter, which breaks up on the threshold of Bloom's consciousness, entering the narrative in broken fragments: "In came Hoppy. Having a wet" (ibid). M'Coy apparently is still going on with his story, but what happens when Hoppy comes in to join Bob Doran and Bantam Lyons in Conways is of no real interest to Bloom, who with a fierce determination, concentrates on attending to the scene unfolding across the street.

As Bloom draws back from M'Coy to get a better view of the lady, so the narrator draws back from Bloom, in a kind of long shot, to align the narrative perspective behind and upon Bloom's rapt gaze, a gaze here maintained at the expenses of his hearing: "Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his veiled eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums" (ibid). Having withdrawn into an ideal spectatorial space where the sun's glare highlights rather than obscures the object of visual desire, Bloom, ever the phenomenologist, notes how propitious are the atmospheric conditions for the street scene being recorded before his veiled and fascinated eyes: "Clearly I see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps" (ibid). This is equivalent to a zoom shot, the long sight of the camera eye, and Bloom accordingly redirects his&#x02014;and our&#x02014;attention from what is transpiring in front of him (he has established some distance from M'Coy, who apparently is standing so close to 

<b></b>

Bloom that he is later remembered only as a talking head rather than a fully embodied human form). "Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will she get up" (ibid). This close-up of the lady's hand generates the kind of suspense in which cinema excels&#x02014;the suspense associated with things about to happen, with the promise of impending physical motion. Bloom soon weaves a narrative out of the imminent act of the lady's departure: "Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for? Sees me looking. Eye out for the other fellow always. Good fallback. Two strings to her bow" (ibid). Scopophilic Bloom isolates and imaginatively transres the handsome woman into a proto-cinematic icon. There is an uncanny moment when she steps out of cinematic immunity and somehow signals that she notices his gaze upon her. This is a privileged moment in cinema, when the actor returns the gaze of the camera, seems indeed to look into and through the camera to confront the eyes of the viewer himself. Something like that direct counter-gaze happens here. Here the effect is less uncanny than encouraging. Bloom seems gratified that the lady in his sights has noticed him, since it allows him to indulge the fantasy that for once he might be "the other fellow"&#x02014;that is, that he might take the part of the adulterous interloper rather than that of cuckold. Casting himself in such an emotionally compensatory role, he elaborates a novelette featuring this haughty creature in an entertaining, morally instructive drama of sexual betrayal and class revenge. "Proud rich: silk stockings" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
At this critical moment, when the film developing in Bloom's mind mutates into fetishistic cinematic spectacle, M'Coy again intrudes with remarks that yank Bloom&#x02014;and us&#x02014;back into the narrative of "outer reality." Bloom, preferring his cinematic Lotus Land, responds half-heartedly to M'Coy's outer call.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

&#x02014;Yes, Mr Bloom said.  

<p class="blockquote">
	He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. Getting up in a minute. 
<p class="blockquote">
<i>	What wrong with him?</i> he said. <i>He's dead,</i> he said. And faith, he filled up. <i>Is it Paddy Dignam?</i> I said. I couldn't believe it when I heard it.

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
But as the next line alerts us, Bloom is less preoccupied with the passing of poor Dignam than with the thought that a delectable woman will soon pass out of view: "Watch! Watch! silk flash rich stockings white Watch! A heavy tram car honking its gong slewed between" (<i>U</i>, 61).
</p>

<p>
I would like to suggest that Bloom's triple self-directive&#x02014;Watch! Watch! Watch!&#x02014; is <i>Ulysses's</i> formal invocation of the muse of cinema. The first two times it is uttered, "watch" takes the imperative form of an injunction and an invitation. Bloom is directing himself to attend to the visual spectacle displayed before his mind's eye. The third "watch" not only intensifies, but transforms the directive to look. It converts injunction and invitation into interpellation: Bloom and the reader, responding to the invitation and the command to watch, become watchers summoned into the voyeuristic regime of cinema itself. "Watch" is the cinematic imperative, summoning us to attend, bidding us to heed, inducting us into the cinematic regime of looks, gazes, and sights.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
A cinematic regime, indeed, but not yet, perhaps never to be, cinema. It is an invocation, after all, that fails to triumph over M'Coy's talking head. Moreover, the narrative seems to forewarn us of this impending disappointment. The moment Bloom instructs himself to watch, a tram car passes across his line of vision, obstructing his view: "Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose" (ibid). As so often, Bloom tickets this ocular adventure with its mythic signature and price tag: "Paradise and the peri" (ibid). What is lost is the chance to follow this woman in a story that will unfold, if at all, off stage, off the page, off screen. What is banished is silent cinema&#x02014;those wordless pantomimes&#x02014;from the precincts of the literary real.
</p>

<p>
Still, as she drives away, Bloom's thoughts evoke the paradise of silent film as he watches the woman fade from view: "The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun. Flicker, flick" (ibid). The light flickering over her "laceflare" hat in the sun recalls the flickering lights of the movie image. If Joyce does not anticipate the slang term for movies, flicks, he encapsulates the essence of the cinema as a paradise lost in that intermittence of light and vision that tantalizes us with a vision of a world familiar but barred to us. It is in this sense that cinema enacts for us the experience of being banished from paradise. As spectators we are the peri, the screen the paradise of heightened life.
</p>

<p>
In literary terms, however, this proves a salutary frustration. This is one of the many incidents recounted in <i>Ulysses</i> in which Bloom is saved from errancy, from losing himself in those fantasy projections so identified with cinema. The errancy here that concerns me is conflating or equating the literary with the cinematic, confusing the image as it takes on definition, color and life in two different mediums. Lessing insisted that the ancients understood the connection between painting and poetry, and did not draw the two arts more closely together than the good of both would warrant.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Joyce here demonstrates the intrinsic discipline of his classicism by drawing as close as he can to the limit where novel encroaches upon cinema's spectacle of attractions, without overstepping the proper bounds of his own literary domain. If the discipline is classical, the poignancy of this moment is Biblical. Through the Joycean logic of metempsychosis, Moses returns as Bloom, the voyeur who may glimpse, but never enter, the promised land of cinema, where life dances tantalizingly before us in dazzling flickers of light.
</p>

<p>
Stephen Dedalus will later claim that "banishment from the heart, from home" (<i>U</i>, 174) is the note that sounds uninterruptedly from the first of Shakespeare's plays to the last. Through Bloom, Joyce may be insinuating a more formal banishment, the peculiar penalty visited upon the author, himself half-blind, for living in the age of film. It is banishment from the realm of the full and resplendent visuality of cinema, the paradise of his mock-heroic voyeur, Bloom. Joyce's honoring of the terms by which literature may approach, but never overstep the boundary separating it from the visual paradise of cinema, may account for what Alan Spiegel memorably called the "ocular loneliness" of <i>Ulysses's</i> primary seers, Stephen and Bloom.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  But perhaps that loneliness is not the product of Joyce's aesthetic detachment, but an unavoidable consequence of his writing about the world in his (imaginary) sights.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
For literature, banishment from a paradise of images is compensated for by depth, by access to an interior where the fateful, not the fortuitous, dwells. This Proust understood, although it took him a lifetime and many thousands of pages to arrive at this recognition. At the outset of <i>Le Recherche</i>, the young narrator, struggling between states of dreaming and waking, flooded by memories and thoughts much like Eisenstein's montage lists, is overcome by "these shifting and confused gusts of memory [that] never lasted for more than a few seconds. It often happened that, in my brief spell of uncertainty as to where I was, I did not distinguish the various suppositions of which it was composed any more than, when we watch a horse running, we isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear on a bioscope (kin&#x000E9;toscope)."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Memory first comes to the narrator in the absorbing, but confusing spectacle of cinema, with all the persistence of vision that gives the enrapt eye the illusion of the physical continuity of life. When we watch a horse running or a woman standing alluringly before a doorway, we can never, by unassisted eye, isolate their successive movements. But whatever the beauty or the vision that is glimpsed, the artist's duty is to transfix as well as be transfixed by reality.
</p>

<p>
That is why Proust will later come to renounce this correspondence between memory and external vision as a false analogy and to reject any suggestion that reality is to be found in the domain of appearances. This rejection entails a rejection of cinema as a sister art. Thus in the last volume of <i>Remembrance of Things Past, The Past Recaptured,</i> he insists that what he understands as reality is not to be found in the dynamic interchange between inside (say, literature) and outside (say, the regime of cinema) but in the successive excavations that lead from surface to depth:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
A writer reasons, that is to say, he goes astray, only when he has not the strength to force himself to make impression pass through all the states which will culminate in its fixation, its expression. The reality he has to express resides, as I now began to understand, not in the superficial appearance of his subject but at a depth at which that appearance matters little, this truth being symbolized for me by that clink of a spoon against a plate, that starched stiffness of a napkin, which had been more of value to me for my spiritual renewal than innumerable conversations of a humanitarian or patriotic or internationalist or metaphysical kind. "Enough of style," had been the cry, enough of literature, let us have life!" . . . For plenty of people who lack the artistic sense, who lack, that is to say, the faculty of submitting to the reality within themselves, may yet possess the ability to expatiate upon the theory of art until the crack of doom. . . . (Some critics now like to regard the novel as a sort of procession of things upon the screen of a cinematograph. This comparison was absurd. Nothing is further from what we have really perceived than the vision that the cinematograph presents.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
"Enough of style!" may be the retort of the cinephiles who attribute to the world of appearances the abiding reality. But the retort should not be taken as the last word on the differences between what literature discloses and the vision of reality the cinema presents.
</p>

<p>
Since I began with a disclaimer about Joyce's relation to film, let me end with an anecdote that puts him right in the middle of one. In Carol Reed's <i>The Third Man</i>, 

<b></b>

the American pulp fiction writer Holly Martins is in Vienna after the war, trying to track down his old friend Harry Lime. He finds himself comically waylaid into a lecture hall where he is introduced as a literary celebrity "from the other side" who can speak authoritatively on modern post-war writing. "Do you believe in the stream of consciousness," a frighteningly earnest reader demands to know. Harry, being both a writer of pulp fiction and a re in a movie, has no idea how to answer. He fidgets, visibly sweating, awaiting his moment of deliverance. His demon interrogator persists, determined to get his money's worth of cultural enlightenment: "What is your opinion of James Joyce? Where would you put Mr Joyce? In what category would you put him in?"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Harry is no better on Joyce than he is on stream of consciousness, so let us oblige him and answer that brutally insistent interrogator: If you must put Joyce in a category, let it be author, not auteur.

In her review of Compton Mackenzie's<i> Sylvia Scarlett</i>, which was later made into a movie starring Katherine Hepburn as Sylvia, Woolf specifically compared the differences between the characters who appear in a novel and those who appear before us on screen. Novelistic characters, she writes, "are a slow-moving race&#x02014;awkward, ungainly and simple-minded. But consider how many things we 

<b></b>

know about them, how much we guess, what scenes of beauty and romance we see them in, how much of England is their background&#x02014;without a word of description perhaps, but merely because they are themselves. We can think about them when we are no longer reading the book. But we cannot do this with Mr Mackenzie's characters; and the reason is, we fancy, that though Mr Mackenzie can see them once he can never see them twice, and, as in a cinema, one picture must follow another without stopping, for if it stopped and we had to look at it we should be bored."

Even Warner Brothers, a studio specializing in proletarian tales of urban, often gangster life, was interested in the movie rights to <i>Ulysses</i>. Joyce dismissed the suggestion that Charles Laughton play Bloom on the grounds that he was "too Aryan" and suggested George Arliss&#x02014;probably, Richard Ellmann speculates, "because he had played the Jew, Disraeli." Ellmann, <i>James Joyce </i>(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), 654. Eisenstein's meeting with Joyce is recounted in Sergei Eisenstein, <i>Immortal Memories</i>, transl. Herbert Marshall (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1983), 214&#x02013;5.

But I would note especially the poignant return and transration of Radek's likening of Joyce's narrative visuality to the microscope in Eisenstein's remembrance of his visit to the now nearly blind writer. He recalls hearing Joyce's own recording of "Anna Livia Plurabelle" and following "the articulated text on a giant meter-wide sheet of paper, filled with gigantic lines of gigantic letters." He then exclaims in admiration: "How in character that is with the author! How in tune with that magnifying glass with which he scans the miscroscopic convolutions of the mysteries of literary language. How symbolic of his romaning along the winding inner movement of emotion and the inner structure of internal speech!" (Eisenstein, <i>Immortal Memories</i>, 215).

<p class="noIndent">
Over the past twenty years, Louis Zukofsky's sestina "'Mantis'" and its companion poem, "'Mantis,' An Interpretation," have come to occupy a prominent position in the reception of the poet's work and in general discussions of the Objectivist movement.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Most accounts focus on one of three issues&#x02014;the poems' relations to marxism, their relations to imagism, or their relations to formalism. The latter is especially well represented in the critical literature: in the words of Zukofsky's biographer Mark Scroggins, the general consensus seems to be that "[t]he knowledge that the poem bears is a function of its relational structure rather than its referential reach."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In this essay, however, I wish to return to the poems' "referential reach," because something has been missing from the discussion around "'Mantis'"&#x02014;i.e., the re of the praying mantis itself, clearly the "object," the rays of which have been brought to a focus by this Objectivist poem. It is as if the rigors demanded of the critical attention by the poem's formal frame render invisible the re at its center. In her essay on the poem, Susan Vanderborg mentions in passing Zukofsky's sense of the "cost of isolating the insect from its past and present contexts"; and it is precisely these contexts&#x02014;particularly the contemporary historical context of "'Mantis'"&#x02014;that I wish to reinvest in the discussion.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  After all, as Zukofsky says in his essay "Modern Times," "[a]rt does not rise out of thin air"; and in "An Objective," he speaks directly to the issue of historical and contemporary contexts:<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

Also the materials which are outside (?) the veins and capillaries&#x02014;The context&#x02014;The context necessarily dealing with a world outside of it&#x02014;The desire for what is objectively perfect, inextricably the direction of historic and contemporary particulars. . . .<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
A poem's "referential reach," then, is the necessary other half of the Objectivist equation, demanding the same grade of attention as the "relational structure" of its form.
</p>

<p>
Thus in spite of the fact that Zukofsky stages the mantis as (literally) rising out of thin air&#x02014;aloft on the updrafts from a subway tunnel&#x02014;the praying mantis was visible in a host of contemporary contexts in 1934, the year the poems were written. My intention here is to recover these contexts, and my main point is this: while critics have articulated the poems' concerns with imagism, marxism, and formalism, no one has adequately discussed their relationship to surrealism: and the praying mantis <i>is</i> the surrealist object as it was being theorized by painters and writers&#x02014;particularly Salvador Dali and Roger Caillois&#x02014;in the early 1930s. References to both of these artists appear in "'Mantis'" and "An Interpretation," and both prominently featured praying mantids in their works at the time. Hence just like "the poor" in "'Mantis,'" Zukofsky's praying mantis "rises from the news"&#x02014;or the newspapers, journals, and art galleries of the day&#x02014;in a myriad of contexts I elucidate below.
</p>

My reading makes visible a critical element in the lineage of the "object" in Objectivism: i.e., the surrealist object as it was being articulated prior to and during 1934. Both surrealism and Objectivism are aesthetic epistemologies, concerned to understand <i>how</i> an object means <i>what </i>it means, and to provide blueprints for producing what Caillois calls "lyrical objects": paintings, sculptures, films, poems. The differences between these epistemologies are profound&#x02014;for reasons I'll detail below, the differences between them preoccupied Zukofsky in 1934&#x02014;and in "'Mantis,'" the poet addresses them directly; in fact, his Objectivist poem at once absorbs the surrealist object and transforms it in a movement that can only be termed dialectical. Situating Zukofsky's mantis among the numerous images of mantids circulating through the surrealist art and theory of the early 1930s allows us to recover a generative tension in the aesthetic ideologies of late modernism.

<p>
This issue is important for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that both Objectivism and surrealism have until recently received short shrift from critics and historians&#x02014;although for very different reasons. Objectivism, a distinctly American homegrown literary "movement"&#x02014;whose status as such has always been problematical&#x02014;has remained obscure, if not entirely invisible, even to American readers and scholars; I address this issue below. Surrealism, on the other hand, while easily the most visible and popularly recognizable of the major twentieth-century art movements, has paradoxically suffered from its very successes, which have tended to diminish it in 

<b></b>

the eyes of critics and art historians. Thus as recently as 2003, Jonathan Eburne can write of the "reductive tendency" that dogs much of the critical work devoted to surrealism, and while he argues that "the study of surrealism has begun to move beyond the endless axiomatic work of summarizing and introducing the movement," he also acknowledges that a great deal of work remains to be done.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> This is especially true in the North American context: here, the definitive work is still Dickran Tashjian's magisterial study <i>A Boatload of Madmen: Surrealism in the American Avant-Garde 1920&#x02013;1950</i>, published in 1995&#x02014;up to which year, Tashjian reminds us, "there had been no detailed study of surrealism in its American setting."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  He goes on to disavow any "claim to be comprehensive" in the present book, which nonetheless remains a major benchmark in the study of surrealism and American modernism. And while Tashjian contributes excellent chapters on American surrealist poets like Parker Tyler and Charles Henri Ford, a definitive critical study of the effects of surrealism on American poetry remains to be undertaken.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In this regard, it is telling that neither Louis Zukofsky nor Lorine Niedecker&#x02014;nor, for that matter, Roger Caillois&#x02014;are mentioned in Tashjian's book.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  For the two Americans poets, surrealism was an important and contentious issue in the 1930s&#x02014;for Niedecker, it remained a critical point for decades to come. The absence of their names does not so much indicate an oversight on Tashjian's part as it illustrates the relative invisibility of the two writers at the time of the publication of <i>A Boatload of Madmen</i>. Indeed, since 1995, scholars and critics have gone a long way towards making these poets, and the Objectivist movement in general, both more visible and more tangible.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Something of a sea-change is currently underway in the ever-ongoing rewriting of the history of modernism, as it becomes increasingly clear to many people that the Objectivist poets represent a compelling alternative to the canons of high modernism as they have been articulated over the past half-century, and that these writers asserted&#x02014;and continue to assert&#x02014;a profound influence on poetic practice after World War II.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The works of Zukofsky and Niedecker and the other Objectivists are currently being rescued from decades of neglect in a salvaging operation that is changing the topography of modernism and its poetic legacies.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  And it is in the mantis-poems of Zukofsky and Niedecker, I will argue here, that the initial collision of these two under-theorized movements of late modernism&#x02014;surrealism and Objectivism&#x02014;occurs. In these works, we witness the opening salvos in a debate that will modulate throughout American poetry and poetics of the latter half of the twentieth century and on into the twenty-first, a debate involving fundamental questions about poetic agency and the nature of the poetic object; the role of cognition in poetic production; the issue of form and its relations to content; and the possibility of a political poetry. When John Ashbery writes in 1968 that "Surrealism has influenced us in so many ways that we can hardly imagine what the world would be without it," he invites us to think more critically of the role that surrealism played both in aesthetics and in larger social circumstances of the mid-century.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  And in his essay from 1985, "The Politics of Poetry: Surrealism and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E," Barrett Watten continues this line of questioning into an interrogation of politics and poetic form in a later phase of avant-garde practice. Because Zukofsky's "'Mantis,'" in 

<b></b>

dialogue with Niedecker's early poetry, initiated this critical preoccupation with the practice of surrealism in American poetry, it is important that we understand the issues at stake in the poem.

Zukofsky and Surrealism in the Early 1930s

<p class="noIndent">
It is by no means immediately obvious that "'Mantis'" and "'Mantis,' An Interpretation" deal in any substantial way with surrealism; this again has something to do with the fact that the poems have not been treated as such by critics. To begin, then, most simply: "'Mantis'" deals with surrealism because, in a letter dated 15 March 1935, Zukofsky tells Ezra Pound that it does so.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  But while Zukofsky does indeed include the stray phrases "Surrealiste/Re-collection" and "Millet in a Dali canvas" (followed by "Circe in E's Cantos") in "'Mantis,' An Interpretation," he nowhere else mentions surrealism in the two poems, which are in no technical way surrealistic.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  It would have been difficult for Pound to do much with these cryptic gestures even if he had read the poem&#x02014;and they haven't lost their obscurity for most readers in the ensuing seventy years.
</p>

<p>
But if we recall the role that surrealism was playing in the arts in America during the early 1930s, we can begin to see Zukofsky's poems as an urgent response to the movement's presence. While officially founded by Andr&#x000E9; Breton in Paris in 1924, it was not until the early 1930s that surrealism became a force in American art and literature.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Its full impact had to wait until the "Newer Super-realism" show at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, which opened on 16 November 1931; and the same exhibition, retitled "Surrealism," when it moved to the Juilien Levy gallery in New York in January of 1932.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  In March of the same year, Levy premiered <i>L'Age D'Or</i>, the collaborative film by Dali and Louis Bunuel&#x02014;the original program of which, by the way, featured on its cover a drawing by Max Ernst of a praying mantis. Thus by the middle of 1932, surrealism had become the subject of a great deal of attention in the American press and among writers and members of the public interested in art&#x02014;although Zukofsky would have been exposed to surrealism even earlier, in the pages of the little magazines of the 1920s and early 1930s&#x02014;notably in Eugene Jolas's <i>transition</i>, which had been publishing surrealist art and literature since 1926.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> Finally, though, it is 1933 that represents the watershed year both for surrealism in the U.S. and for Zukofsky's exposure to and concern with the movement. <i>Minotaure</i>, the premier surrealist journal, began publication in June of that year and was distributed in New York by Levy.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Dali's first one-man show in New York at Levy's extended from 20 November to 31 December of 1933; one of the persons to visit it was Lorine Niedecker, who published her surrealist-inflected poem "Promise of Brilliant Funeral" in <i>Poetry</i> magazine in September; in a letter dated 31 January, she tells Harriet Monroe that Zukofsky "referred [her] to the surrealists for correlation."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  And on 12 December, Dali published an article on art nouveau in <i>Minotaure</i>; I will argue below that in <i>"</i>'Mantis,'" Zukofsky refers to the photographs accompanying this article. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Zukofsky also spent two and a half months (July to mid-September) of 1933 abroad, first in Paris, then in Italy to visit Pound. In Paris, <i>Minotaure</i> was the important new publication, and the Gallerie Pierre Collet had hosted two surrealist exhibitions in June, the second a one-man show featuring Dali's "Millet's Angelus," to which, as we've seen, Zukofsky alludes in "An Interpretation."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  And again, Zukofsky mentions the surrealists to Pound, in a letter dated 12 July and written on stationery from the Hotel du Perigord.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Thus by the end of 1933, Zukofsky had certainly encountered the surrealists, who by all accounts were a cultural force to be reckoned with, whether in Europe or America, in the pages of literary journals or on the walls of art galleries. It is in this context that "'Mantis'" was conceived. The question is, what exactly did one "see" when one looked at or read the works of the surrealists in 1934?

Roger Caillois's "Lyrical Object": Praying Mantids in Surrealist Art and Theory
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In fact, one saw praying mantids, which were prominently featured both in the visual arts and in the literature and theory at the time, and which by 1934 had achieved an iconic significance for the surrealists.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Sidra Stick notes that the praying mantis is among those "swarms of anthropomorphic insects and insectile humans" that fascinated the surrealists, who "created images like [Giacometti's] 'Woman with Her Throat Cut,' which represent female/insect rations as entrapping menaces who are also the victims of violence, pain, and destruction."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Be that as it may, mantids and mantid-inspired forms proliferate in the painting of the early 1930s. Aside from Dali and Caillois, who I deal with in detail below, "Picasso suggestively adapted the most characteristic features of the praying mantis in two important canvases, <i>Seated Bather </i>and the <i>Crucifixion</i>, which date from the beginning of 1930" ("PM," 607), according to William L. Pressly, who reads the re in the former as an insect-headed woman with mantid mandibles. I've already mentioned Ernst's mantis cover for <i>L'Age d'Or,</i> but paintings like 1931's <i>Human re</i> also feature mantid-like forms, and a praying mantis appears prominently in the second plate of the Easter Island section of his collage novel, <i>Une Semaine de Bonte,</i> of 1934.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Finally, Pressly tells us, "Andr&#x000E9; Masson was the artist who most consistently exploited the image of the praying mantis" ("PM," 607). Mantids skitter across canvases like <i>Summer Divertissement </i>(<a href="#1"> 1</a>) and <i>Insect's Betrothal </i>(both from 1934), and Masson continued to paint mantids throughout the later 1930s. Mantids were "in the air," or at any rate in the paint, in 1934, and Zukofsky was no doubt aware of their presence.
</p>

<p>
This is brought home conclusively when we consider Dali and Caillois. By 1934, the former had achieved a great deal of notoriety.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  We've already seen that Zukofsky was familiar with his work. I will address Dali below. But it was Roger Caillois, I have discovered, who provided the immediate impulse for the "'Mantis'" poems. In May of 1934, <i>Minotaure</i> published an essay by Caillois called "Le Mante religieuse" in which he examined the praying mantis as the prime example of the surrealist "lyrical object":

Certain objects and certain images, as a result of a particularly significant form or content, enjoy a greater lyrical potential than others. This potential is valid for a very large number of individuals if not for everyone, so that it seems to be an essential part of the element in question and consequently to have as much claim as this element to objectivity. -

	The praying mantis seemed to me, by its name, form, and habits, to present to a rare degree this objective capacity to act immediately upon one's affectivity, which is so useful in resolving the problem of the lyrical communication of the syntheses of the imagination. I therefore carried out some research to confirm my hypothesis on this matter and to understand, by taking a concrete example, how a representation could act upon each individual separately and, so to speak, secretly, in the absence of any symbolic character that would essentially derive meaning from its social use and the greater part of its emotional effectiveness from its role within the community.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

Caillois goes on to examine the praying mantis from various perspectives, describing it in biological and socio-historical terms, analyzing its names and the scientific terminology used to classify it, and collecting various religious, mythic, and legendary anecdotes about it.

It is clear that Zukofsky lifted this information almost verbatim out of Caillois's <i>Minotaure </i>article, suggesting that, in the poem, he is not so much encountering a mantis as he is encountering a "Mantis," i.e., a <i>text</i> (which could account for the quotation marks that always accompany the title of the poem). Michael Davidson calls the mantis "a curriculum"; I concur, but I would point out that it is a curriculum with a very distinct (surrealist) origin.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
If "'Mantis'" is, as Zukofsky tells Pound, a poem about the state of surrealism in 1934, it only makes sense that Caillois's text appears in the middle of it. But we must interrogate "Le Mante religieuse" in order to understand what use Zukofsky is making of it: "'Mantis'" is by no means a surrealist poem, although it is "about" surrealism and has a (literal) surrealist subtext. The question is, <i>how</i> is Zukofsky translating Caillois's surrealist lyrical object in(to) his Objectivist poem?
</p>

<p>
In "Le Mante religieuse," Caillois attempts to articulate the terms of what he calls "the systematic overdetermination" ("LMR," 79) of objects&#x02014;which means, as we've seen in the quote above, the capacity for certain objects to work immediately and 

<b></b>

"lyrically" upon "each individual" <i>independently </i>of any socially constructed meaning or cultural symbolic character. Presumably, then, the mantis would "act immediately upon one's affectivity" by stimulating a "primordial" level of the psyche; Caillois concludes his essay by calling the mantis one of those "<i>objective ideograms,</i> which are, in short, <i>a material realization in the external world of the virtual lyrical and passional elements of consciousness</i>" ("LMR," 85). While the "objective lyrical value of the praying mantis" is only "increased" by the scientific facts and folk legends Caillois catalogues in his essay, it cannot be reduced to those facts. To understand the generalized "disturbance" everyone seems to feel at encountering a praying mantis, we must descend to a <i>biological</i> level: human beings feel "an unequivocal attraction to the praying mantis" ("LMR," 79), according to Caillois, because of a series of uncanny correspondences between the insect's shape and behaviors, and various human neuroses.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Thus the mantid's supposed "vampirism" "corresponds to a certain phase of [human] affective development"; i.e., the "castration complex."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Likewise, "[n]aturalists find in the praying mantis an extreme form of the close connection that often seems to combine sexual with nutritional voluptuousness, a connection that Dali has made immediately and intuitively explicit" ("LMR," 80). Its physical rigidity assimilates "the mantis to an automaton&#x02014;that is, in view of its anthropomorphism, to a female android" ("LMR," 82) (cf. Zukofsky: "Android, loving beggar, dive to the poor/As your love would even without head to you" [<i>CSP</i>, 66]), and hence evokes thoughts of death. The mimetism of mantises "illustrates in a somewhat hallucinatory fashion the human desire for a return to an original insensibility that one must compare with the pantheistic conception of a fusion with nature, a frequent philosophical and literary translation of the return to a prenatal consciousness" ("LMR," 83). In short, the mantis, "in its form, being of all the forms the one in which man can recognize his own" ("LMR," 84), is precisely "a <i>material realization in the external world of the virtual lyrical and passional elements of consciousness.</i>"As such, it is the premier surrealist "objective ideogram," an object that immediately inspires irrational fear and attraction by operating directly on the unconscious.
</p>

<p>
The mantis that Zukofsky encounters in the subway inspires just such a range of visceral and immediate emotions, but it also leads to the possibility of historical and political interventions that are absent from Caillois's texts&#x02014;and from the other various appearances of the mantis in surrealist contexts. And if he hadn't already noticed the connection between surrealism and the praying mantis, Zukofsky would have heard it rendered in Caillois's essay, where the latter explicitly mentions the mantid theme in Dali's study of Millet.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Since "Millet in a Dali canvas" appears in "'Mantis'": An Interpretation"&#x02014;and in interesting company, i. e., "Circe in E's Cantos" &#x02014;it is to the re of the praying mantis in Dali's work that I now turn, in order to sketch more completely the surrealist object against which Zukofsky was writing.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

"The Object as Revealed": Dali's Predatory Metro
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Dali's preoccupation with praying mantids began as early as 1930 and peaked in 1934 with his book-length study <i>Le mythe tragique de l'Angelus de Millet: Interpretation </i>

<b></b>

<i>paranoiaque-critique </i>(not published until 1963, but already mentioned, as we've seen above, by Caillois in 1934).The earliest reference I can find to praying mantids in Dali's published public writing occurs in "L'Amour" &#x02014;which, again, may be where Zukofsky learned of Dali's "sodomitical" inclinations.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Dali mentions mantids here in the context of the psychology of love, dreams, and preadation, and the image of the praying mantis as the devouring female ultimately serves to bring together a number of related concerns in Dali's work as the 1930s wear on.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Two of these in particular, I will argue, are critical to Zukofsky's mantis poems. Firstly, Dali uses the praying mantis to develop a theory of "predatory" art&#x02014;and here we may recall Zukofsky's call in "An Objective" for "[t]he object unrelated to palpable or predatory intent" ("O," 16). Secondly, he explicitly associates the praying mantis with the entrances to the Paris metro: hence Zukofsky's mantis in the subway updraft. In a very real sense, what Zukofsky encounters in "'Mantis'" is not so much an insect, but a Dali text winging up at him from the entrance to the underground.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the best way to approach Dali's mantis/Millet/metro confluence is to chronicle it as it develops from 1930 on. We've seen the mantis in association with devouring and dream in "L'Amour"; in 1931, Dali publishes "Surtout l'art ornemental," in which he transfers the oneirics of predation from humans to the art nouveau-inspired ornamental wrought iron entrances of the Paris metro.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This predatory or gustatory cast to art nouveau decoration is also the subject of his essay "Concerning the Terrifying and Edible Beauty of Art Nouveau Architecture," which ran in <i>Minotaure </i>3&#x02013;4 during the winter of 1933&#x02013;1934. Most remarkable are the four Brassa&#x000EF; photographs of the Hector Guimard wrought-iron ornaments in the entrance to the Paris metro which accompany Dali's essay. As both Pressly and Haim Finkelstein point out, these are explicitly shot to resemble praying mantids poised in what Dali calls the "spectral attitude" of post-coital, cannibalistic mantid aggression (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). The ornamental iron of the metro is another "lyrical ideogram," an overdetermined object which, like Caillois's praying mantis, is a "<i>material realization in the external world of the virtual lyrical and passional elements of consciousness,</i>"although in this case the biological mantis can be sensed <i>through</i> the crafted metal of the ornament.
</p>

<p>
The link to Millet's painting is made explicit in the caption under the photograph at top left: "It has moreover to do with the metal atavism of Millet's L'Angelus." The mantis-like posture of the iron ornament resembles the bowed re of the praying woman in Millet's <i>Angelus,</i> a painting which Dali reproduced numerous times in his own work, and which is the subject of his <i>Le mythe tragique de l'Angelus de Millet: Interpretation paranoiaque-critique. </i>In this work, Dali describes the "atavism" of the female re in Millet's painting as manifested by her "expectant" or "spectral" posture, and goes on to work out in great detail his "paranoic-critical" reading of the painting, focusing on the re of the praying mantis and generally following Caillois's examination of the insect's "lyrical potential." Hence the latter's citation of Dali's use of "the fearsome insect" in his "paranoic-critical study," and hence the series of grotesque metamorphoses through which Millet's peasants travel during the 1930s in Dali's paintings and graphic works.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The difference is that for Dali, the praying mantis itself is not 

<b></b>

the lyrical object that so violently stimulates the unconscious; instead, the "spectre" of the mantis <i>haunts</i> the images in the painting, just as its presence can be sensed in the iron ornaments of the metro.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In sum, the praying mantis had developed by the summer of 1934 into a central and highly visible icon for the surrealists.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Zukofsky's admonition to Pound that had he read "An Interpretation," he would have "found out" that it concerned surrealism, suggests that Zukofsky thought anyone who kept up with the arts at the time would have recognized the mantis as a subject of recent surrealist discourse: what else in the poem would alert one to such a notion? As part of a more general interest in the hermeneutics of the unconscious, the preoccupation with mantids and mantid-like forms in the surrealist arts and writing of the early 1930s was an attempt to comprehend the mechanics of unconscious projection, to determine the procedures whereby the mind senses correspondences between natural phenomena and its own neuroses. Primarily through the writings of Dali and Caillois, the praying mantis became the premier lyrical object of surrealism. It was an object always already (a) complex; a text whose "wing's leaves" (Zukofsky's phrase) required reading and analysis; a creature whose universally terrifying "effect," acting "secretly," could only be gauged from a position outside of history. In other words, it was an object whose meaning did not derive from "its social use" or "its role within the community," but instead from the organic structure of the psyche.

<p class="noIndent">
This, then, is the composite object that Zukofsky runs into in the subway entrance&#x02014;a "paranoic" thing, rooted in unconscious neuroses and complexes, that immediately and simultaneously evokes fear, attraction, and repulsion in the poet, who "can't bear to look, cannot touch,&#x02014;You&#x02014;": "Don't light on my chest, mantis! do . . . ," he commands in contradiction. Zukofsky's "Re-collection" of Caillois's surrealist collection of facts and stories in stanzas four, five, and six shows that he had read "Le Mante religieuse"carefully, and again suggests that "'Mantis'" is not so much the description of a sudden encounter between a man and an insect, but a more carefully nuanced account of an encounter between a poet and a <i>movement</i>.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Indeed, with Dali's mantic metro as subtext, what Zukofsky encounters in the poem might more accurately be construed as an unconscious force, a force moving through and in-forming the myriad objects of modernity. But here it is most clearly apprehended in that quintessentially modern space, the subway&#x02014;itself a fundamental sign of modernity ever since Pound's "A Station in the Metro," a poem in which the poet also encounters phantoms (i.e., "apparitions").

Zukofsky's use of Caillois in this way also suggests that Zukofsky is not entirely dismissive of surrealism. Indeed, his own "original shock" (<i>CSP</i>, 72) at the mantis would seem to confirm Caillois's "hypothesis" regarding the universal and unconscious reaction of people to the insect. Not only does he appropriate Caillois's catalogue to partly account

<b></b>

for what he calls his "sudden jolt," but his project in "An Interpretation" closely parallels Caillois's project in "Le Mante religeuse." In the process of describing how he came to determine the proper form (i. e., the sestina) for the poem, Zukofsky is at pains to understand how the mantis provokes so many intense and various feelings, and all in a heartbeat:

While hyper-textualists may want to hear the title of Jolas's journal at the end of this quote, Zukofsky locates his response to the mantis in his "One human's intuitive Head" (<i>CSP</i>, 68), or more locally, in the "[i]nevitable recurrence again in the blood," (<i>CSP</i>, 69) and in the "nerves, glandular facilities, [and] electrical cranial charges" (<i>CSP</i>, 71) of the brain. At one point, he even evokes what appears to be Carl Jung's collective unconscious, when he describes

But there is a crucial difference between the two writers' conclusions about the praying mantis. While Caillois's mantis affects the psyche at the level of the neurotic complexes, stimulating castration anxieties, desires to return to the womb, and other "primordial passional conflicts," Zukofsky's remains resolutely <i>sensual </i>and <i>textual</i>: his concern is instead with a "forgetting and remembering Head" (<i>CSP</i>, 68):

The "residue" of the Melanesian creation-myth in our emotions, then, is not archetypal, but is instead the product of something that has been <i>read</i>, <i>heard</i>,or <i>seen</i>: i.e., in this case, Caillois's essay, which Zukofsky had no doubt read before he encountered the mantis (the poems were written on 27 October and 4 November, respectively). For Zukofsky, the mantis provokes <i>only recent memories,</i> not a collective unconscious:

This stanza of "An Interpretation" is critical for understanding Zukofsky's critique and transformation of Caillois's surrealist lyrical object into his own Objectivist lyrical object. Note that the poet is most interested in the point at which the "senses' awareness" interfaces with the "invoked collective," which, as we've seen above, comprises "whatever has been read, heard, and seen." Here again, like Caillois, Zukofsky interrogates his shocked reaction to the mantis, as the product of what he "presently" sees (i.e., the mantis in the subway) and what he's formerly learned (whether forgotten or remembered) of mantids. However, the collective, he says, remains <i>as propaganda</i>&#x02014;not 

<b></b>

as an archetypal unconscious, but as a "material" with a "use function." Zukofsky thus implicitly criticizes any art in which an "invoked collective/ . . . subdue[s] the senses' awareness": i.e., an art which insists that objects like the mantis are only signifiers of an a-historical, universal Unconscious, an art which loses the "senses' awareness"&#x02014;and hence the present scene, transected by history and politics.

<p>
This is in fact precisely the substance of his comments regarding surrealism in "Modern Times," written just two years after the Mantis poems:

<blockquote class="extract">

Start with an obsession of eating, like the surrealistes, and what exists is obsession, a razor blade consuming an eyeball, as in Dali's <i>Le Chien Andalou,</i> and congealing all movement. . . .

Here, then, is "predatory" art, an art that is not just itself obsessed with appetite and predation, but which constantly collapses "lyrical objects" into their Freudian pretexts, their "'scientific'" data forever used to rehearse versions of castration anxiety or the Oedipal complex. Zukofsky advocates in this essay a return to "the historical dimension of events actually happening" ("MT," 59); as against the films of Jean Cocteau and Ren&#x000E9; Clair, he praises Charlie Chaplin for realizing his characters "as products of the economics of working day life or a holiday and present[ing] them as people of impulse" ("MT," 59):
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Charlie's devices and "types" live with material thoughtfulness and thus historical meaning. . . . So that a new idea in a new Chaplin film is not merely a notion, a general sense of today, or an understanding of politics, art, life or whatever, but inventive existence interacting with other existence in all its ramifications: sight, hearing, muscular movement, coordination of all the senses acting on the surrounding world and rendering it laughably intelligent.

"'Mantis'" is just such a montage, a poem gathering together a host of interacting facts, emotions, texts, memories, and impressions, all situated in a particular historical moment, and bringing them into the dialectic of "thought's torsion." Zukofsky famously likens the Objectivist poem to a camera, "<i>the lens bringing the rays of an object to a focus . . . inextricably the direction of historic and contemporary particulars</i>" ("O," 12). Thus, like Chaplin's cinema, Zukofsky's poem captures an "existence interacting with other existence in all its ramifications":

Zukofsky's two poems make up a long commentary on surrealism and its objects; on the limits of a hermeneutics so categorically bound to the texts of psychoanalysis; and on the inability of the "movement" to "move." While surrealism's data has "become more and more inert," "the mantis <i>can start</i>/History etc."&#x02014;or at any rate can <i>startle</i> it into starting.

Unlike the surrealists, who "subdue the senses' awareness" and thus the present (historical) scene in their pursuit of the unconscious and its complexes, the Objectivist poet keeps both "the simultaneous" (i.e., incidents, objects, immediate "existence in all its ramifications") and "the diaphanous" (i.e., what has previously been seen, heard, and read, cropping up as it does unexpectedly in the blood) <i>historical</i>, in his one head. For Zukofsky, the unconscious is a product of culture and history, not nature and instinct&#x02014;to defer to the latter is to replace the possibility of revolutionary movement with the inertia of psychological archetypes.
</p>

<p>
But Zukofsky makes here what is perhaps an inevitable and certainly a suggestive association between the poet's Head and the decapitated head of the male praying mantis, also alluded to at the end of "'Mantis'": "Android, loving beggar, dive to the poor/As your love would even without head to you" (<i>CSP</i>, 66). This alignment of capitals suggests an element of danger: the female surrealist mantis decapitates the male 

<b></b>

Objectivist mantis, whose Head continues its Orphic song regardless. Surrealism was, as I pointed out earlier, a potent new aesthetic just beginning to become prominent in American arts and letters, and Zukofsky no doubt felt threatened by its rising popularity, especially given the public's general lack of interest in his own work and that of his fellow Objectivists. Perhaps he realized that his call at the end of "'Mantis'" for the return of the surrealist lyrical object to a revolutionary "use"&#x02014;

&#x02014;would go unanswered; certainly, there was little in the winter of 1934 to suggest otherwise.
</p>

<p>
But Zukofsky was also aware that his audience was small and intimate and primarily included other poets, like Williams, Pound&#x02014;and Niedecker, with whom in 1934 he shared a close correspondence. Zukofsky's disapproval of Niedecker's interest in surrealism has been well documented; I have already mentioned her visit to the 1933 Dali show, the publication of her surrealist-inspired poems in <i>Poetry</i>, and Zukofsky's referral of her to the surrealists "for correlation."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  In February and May of 1934, she sent two three-poem series, entitled "CANVAS" (later spelled "CANVASS") and "Three Poems," to Harriet Monroe, who promptly rejected them; all six poems were published by Pound in <i>Bozart-Westminster </i>in the summer of 1935. Niedecker describes both series as "an experiment in three planes: left row is deep subconscious, middle row beginning of monologue, and right row surface consciousness" (<i>LN:WP</i>, 182): hence the Freudian paradigm critical to the surrealists. In fact, it is in the context of a discussion regarding surrealism that Pound complains to Zukofsky about these poems. In the same letter&#x02014;in fact, in the same paragraph&#x02014;in which he admonishes Pound for not reading "'Mantis'" and hence not understanding his opinion regarding surrealism, Zukofsky mentions Niedecker's "mental stubbornness" regarding the issue. Thus in "'Mantis,'" Zukofsky was also responding to the surrealist proclivities of one of his closest associates, as is illustrated in Niedecker's "Beyond What":
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
Do we not see in these lines the re of the praying mantis? Niedecker's interest in surrealism in 1933 and 1934 coincided with the publication of Caillois's "Le Mante Religieuse" in <i>Minotaure </i>and with Dali's ongoing preoccupation with the praying 

<b></b>

mantis in his essays and painting. To employ phrases like "decapitated areas," "liquidating aftermath," and "black winged lazuli" in a surrealist poem in 1934 was to evoke the mantis that was ubiquitous in surrealist discourse at the time. Niedecker's cryptic phrases sketch a mantis couple at the precise moment of the post-coital decapitation of the male by the female, as the "inspired marksmanship" of the female leads to the "gleeful instant" of the cannibal feast. The spectral insect haunts Niedecker's language just as it can be sensed through the iron ornaments of the Paris metro.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  That Niedecker labels "Beyond What" the "subconscious" entry of the series only corroborates this&#x02014;whatever the fragmentary, insectoid lyrical object in the poem is, it participates in the very specific surrealist vocabulary designed to evoke the violent and demonic underside of the psyche that Caillois and Dali argue is so sensitive to the image of the praying mantis.

<p>
The apparition of the praying mantis also peeks out of "Canvass," the left-row subconscious section of Niedecker's earlier triptych poem of the same name:

The bent petal of line one suggests the ubiquitous foliage that acts as camouflage for the mantis's leaflike body (think of the jungles that Masson's and Ernst's mantids inhabit); the masked ovoid eggs in the middle of the poem and the color counters "bluegreen" and "flat grey shoulder" accommodate themselves to the re of a predatory insect, as the "carrions eats its call, waste it." Even the droll ecclesiastical carriage of the praying mantis is caught in the "testament to Sundays" of the poem's final phrase.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the "refractory" of line one, suggesting the refraction of the bent petal, also evokes "refectory," the dining hall in a monastery or a convent. The poem reads as a sort of gnomic hallucination of erotic predation&#x02014;"gnosis" and "loin" peek through

the refracted foliage of the first three lines, and the language in the middle of the poem&#x02014;"cream redbronze/attempt salmon egress/masked eggs/ovoid/anodyne lament"&#x02014;suggest spermatazoa swimming salmon-like upstream to ova (only to end up "lamented"). The rhetorical registers of the poem multiply: "anodyne" suggests "anodize," the process of coating metal; hence the "steel-tin/bluent" and the metal bluegreen/drying." Anyone who has ever blued the barrel of a gun recognizes what's going on here&#x02014;this is a poem about hunting: one blues a rifle barrel in order to protect it from moisture. "Smoke dent" and "exceptional retard" suggest the firing and recoil of the weapon, braced against a "flat grey shoulder." Apparently what's being hunted here is a <i>canvas</i>back&#x02014;in the words of Webster's, the canvasback duck has a "brownish-red (i.e., "redbronze") head, dark breast, and light grey back" (i.e., "flat grey shoulder"). In true surrealist fashion, Niedecker violently yokes dissimilar images to present a dream-like collage or collision of images of hunting, sex, and eating&#x02014;the copulating cannibal mantis is also the duck hunter. Or, to transpose the letters of the single word in the fourth line, a <i>drake </i>hunter; for the hunter of "Canvass" is explicitly a hunt<i>ress</i>&#x02014;"she knows how/For a testament to Sundays"&#x02014;whose "inspired marksmanship" becomes the subject of "Beyond What."

<p>
While Zukofsky's mantis poems can thus be read as a riposte to the petalbent devil in Niedecker's early surrealist work, Niedecker was perhaps threatening to Zukofsky in 1934 for reasons other than her attraction to surrealism. And while the details of their personal relationship remain controversial, the praying mantis operates as a highly suggestive lyrical object through which the two poets could consider not only their aesthetic allegiances but also their very fraught sexual relationship, whatever its details may have been.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Not only was Niedecker reading about and looking at res like Dali's <i>Homage to the "Angelus" of Millet</i> (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) and <i>Architectonics of Millet's Angelus</i>, but she was incorporating them directly into her poetry. On the May&#x02013;June 1935 calendar page of the text known as "Next Year, or I Fly My Rounds Tempestuous," dated by Zukofsky Christmas 1934, Niedecker scrawled the following poem:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

Dali's picture (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) depicts the two bent peasants of Millet's painting as brick ruins, mourning two tumbledown structures at their feet. Clearly, Dali's threatening woman continued to haunt Niedecker's imagination, if only "aurally." In the winter of 1934, was she planning to use its mantid wings "next year" to "fly her rounds tempestuous"?

<p>
The details of the poets' personal relationship may never be clear. It suffices to say that Zukofsky's two poems about surrealism were intended as both a plea and a warning to writers like Niedecker. If the surrealist is, ratively speaking, the mantis in "'Mantis,'" then Zukofsky's call to her to fly on the armies of the poor reads as a request for a return to a political poetry; alternatively, Zukofsky is warning us that the surrealist praying mantis can bite off a poet's head&#x02014;the "forgetting and remembering Head"&#x02014;rendering the poet, not a bodiless Head, but a headless Body, a pre-conscious intelligence tied to the fiction of instinctual drives and blind to the historical circumstances around it.
</p>

<p>
In a short piece from 1930 entitled "Influence," Zukofsky discusses the matter of the effect upon the poet of other writers and traditions:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The matter of an influence acting in common upon individual temperaments results in differences which have variegated it and been variegated by it in accordance with: 1. its presence in the air: sometimes the proximity of a poet's edified literary acquaintances, however conscious or unconscious a poet may be of the almost literal drafts around him; 2. coincidence of the temperament affected and the temperament only apparently, not actually affecting; since the modality of events of a period of fifty or seventy-five years may show, at any time of their calendar, two similar individuals, different as to locale, and contemporary or anachronistic as to their birth and mortuary dates; 3. conscious choice or rejection of a literary tradition.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Here is "'Mantis'" in a nutshell: the poem is precisely a response to a "presence in the air"; and in this case the insect "steadying lost/In the cars' drafts" and the "almost literal (literary) drafts" around the poet come ultimately to the same thing&#x02014;the Objectivist transformation of the surrealist lyrical object.

On page 148, Eburne writes: "Even now, in an era longing to resist the mounting pressures of orthodoxy and fundamentalism, we continue to brand surrealism as an orthodoxy of it own, albeit an orthodoxy of the bizarre. In the eyes of its Anglo-American critics, surrealism still tends to designate a quaint set of formal practices that produced the movement's unusual, if obfuscatory, visual and verbal works, as well as its broader 'utopian' program of dream and revolution."

Most importantly, the last four years has seen the reappearance&#x02014;and at times the <i>first</i> appearance&#x02014;of both Zukofsky's and Niedecker's major works, many if not all of which had been out of print for years. Niedecker's collected works, edited by Jenny Penberthy, appeared in 2002; and between 2000 and 2004, the six volumes of <i>The Wesleyan Centenniel</i> <i>Edition of the Complete Critical Writings of Louis Zukofsky</i> were published. Both poets were also the subjects of major centennial conferences: The Lorine Niedecker Centenary Celebration 1903&#x02013;2002 took place from 9 to 11 October in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and The Louis Zukofsky Centennial Conference at Columbia University and Barnard College took place in New York from 17 to 19 September 2004.

Here, the history of the various Norton anthologies of poetry over the last twenty years is instructional. Zukofsky was included in the first edition  of <i>The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry</i>, but was dropped from the second edition, published in 1988. He subsequently reappeared in the third edition, published in 2003. He has never appeared in the more comprehensive and general <i>Norton Anthology of Poetry</i>, although he is mentioned as a "theorist" who influenced Michael Palmer in the latter's biographical sketch in the fifth edition of that anthology, published in 2005. Niedecker's first appearance in a Norton Anthology was in 2003's third edition.

In what appears to be an uncanny coincidence, the review of the Julien Levy show by Matthew Josephson in <i>The New Republic</i> for 3 February 1932 is followed by a very short story by one Moe Bragin entitled "The Praying Mantis." In this story, a group of working men&#x02014;a cabby, a waiter, a cook, and "the owner of the dog"&#x02014;who says things like "[Hoover] don't do nothing about this deepression"&#x02014;watch a dog attack a praying mantis as they "sit on boxes in the night" behind a "cheap lunch room in a 

<b></b>

Virginia city" and discuss current politics. The mantis "'must be one of them bugs the gov'ment brings in to eat germs,' says the cabby," who later crushes the wounded insect with his foot. The four men complain about the ineffectual policies of the Hoover administration and the Depression in general, and conclude that the mantis is better off dead, since it will not have to work. I have no idea whether or not Zukofsky saw either the review or this story, but it reminds one of his call in "'Mantis'" for the mantis to "Fly . . . on the poor, arise like leaves/The armies of the poor . . . " (<i>CSP</i>, 66). See <i>The New Republic: A Journal of Opinion</i> LXIX:896 (New York, Wednesday, 3 February 1932), 321&#x02013;2.

In a letter dated 17 February of the same year, William Carlos Williams recommends that Zukofsky read a review of the Levy show in <i>Fifth Floor Window</i> that he terms "a readable article on Surrealism" (cited in Dickran Tashjian, <i>Williams and Automatic Writing: Against the Presence of Surrealism</i>, in <i>William Carlos Williams Review</i> 21.2 [Fall, 1995], 10).

Influenced by the writings of Freud and fascinated by his concept of man's repressed sexuality, the Surrealists found this insect's cannibalistic nuptial a compelling image of the potential for erotic violence lurking in the darker recesses of the human mind" ("PM," 600).

"It is not surprising that the great similarity between humanity's organic structure and biological development, combined with the identical external conditions of its physical world, should have considerable resonances in its psychic world, tending to produce within it a minimum number of similar reactions and consequently spawning within every mind the same affective tendencies and primordial passional conflicts . . .

The case of Dali is even more applicable because of the impressive, comprehensive document on the relationship between love and <i>homophagy</i> that goes to make up his paranoiaco-critical study of Millet's <i>Angelus</i>; he was forced to bring in the fearsome insect that in fact unites these two savage desires" ("LMR," 80).

The subject-rhyme here of Pound's Circe and Dali's praying mantis in "his paranoiaco-critical study of Millet's <i>Angelus</i>" is worth noting: in the same letter (March 1935) to Pound where he berates him for not reading "'Mantis,' An Interpretation," Zukofsky writes that "in Mr. Pound's last 'Cantos' I have found nothing to move the cockles of my heart or the network of my brain, outside of 5 lines (perfect lines) given over to Hathor and her box and some musical metaphysics of the dark Cavalcanti" (<i>PZ</i>, 164). This directs us to Canto XXXIX (published in <i>Eleven New Cantos XXXI&#x02013;XLI</i> in 1934), a poem given over entirely to the Circe episode (Book X) of the <i>Odyssey</i>. Pound describes here the heavily opiated, densely sexual atmosphere of Aiaia. Zukofsky suggests that Circe is a type of the sexual predator that the surrealists objectified as the praying mantis.

"In addition to the well-known symbolic eroticism of mystical ecstasies to which the posture of the woman in <i>L'Angelus</i> corresponds, you will agree with me that the position of the hands brought up together under the chin and leaving exposed especially the legs and the belly, is a common posture. . . . This posture entails in my opinion very distinct exhibitionistic, expectant, and aggressive factors. In fact, we are dealing with a typical posture of expectation. It is an immobility that is a prelude to imminent violence. It is also the classical springing posture of animals, and it is one that is common to kangaroos and boxers; and above all, it is the one dramatically illustrated by the praying mantis (spectral posture)" (<i>DCW</i>, 290&#x02013;1).

One of the oddest conjunctions of surrealism and praying mantids is made by Julien Levy in <i>Memoir of an Art Gallery</i> (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1977) where he describes Arthur Cravan:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Bravado, Craven, how you are transformed! Into a praying mantis that flew into my room years ago and nibbled into my ear that you were Arthur Cravan, friend of our best friends, father of my first wife's half-sister. Are you praying now, or preying, out in the wild?. . . . And there was the time there appeared on my wall a mantis, clawing a painting by Yves Tanguy&#x02014;if it was you. Then that summer night in Yves' own room when we spoke of you and mantis again, you flew in the window. We preserved you in a jelly jar. Jean Cocteau thought you very genial, a Knight of his Round Table. Marcel Duchamp thought you were Marcel Duchamp. He told me this once, and, unbelievably, another mantis flew by. When I was in Greenwich Village, a girl who said her name was Margie (she later explained it was a marginal name) rang the doorbell, boldly put her foot in the door, and asked, "Did you call my call house?" A mantis was tangled in her hair and she was your joking daughter Fabienne, quite disguised. I have a short film of your t with the world champion prizeter Jack Johnson. It was mislaid for a period, and the day it turned up, I swear a mantis entered my house again.

Talking in the Cinema

<p class="noIndent">
The German novelist Gert Hofmann's <i>The Film Explainer</i>  is a semi-autobiographical account of Hofmann's grandfather, who was a film "lecturer" or "explainer" (and cinema pianist) in provincial Germany throughout the silent era and beyond. Finally made redundant in the early 1930s by the triumph of sound film, he defends his role to the cinema proprietor until the last: "I'm not superfluous. An audience needs someone to explain a film to them, at least its finer points. They have no idea what is contained in a film if you look at it closely, in every single shot. No, no, said Grandfather, that must be explained. Otherwise, it would be lost."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  He is finally routed by a screening of <i>The Jazz Singer</i> (which arrives in the village some years after its U.S. premiere): "After a while, the film started talking again. It explained itself . . . Ridiculous, all that talking! Who does that in real life, whispered Grandfather, I certainly don't, and everyone shouted: Quiet! You're being a nuisance, Hindenburg! . . . . Anyway, instead of sitting and listening quietly, Grandfather talked and commented his way though the first sound-film ever shown at the Apollo in Limbach" (<i>FE</i>, 82&#x02013;3).
</p>

<p>
As an increasing number of films start to talk, the grandfather retreats into silence. His "silent period" is broken by his attendance at local Nazi party meetings: "when the sound-film era began, I suddenly couldn't talk any more. I thought: There is no one left who is interested in your ideas. But now I'm talking again!" (<i>FE</i>, 177). In fact, what he wants to talk about are 

<b></b>

film-scenarios and a proposal for "the re-introduction of silent films in the context of national renewal" (<i>FE</i>, 179). In 1939, the old man is taken to Berlin with a local group to attend a Nazi rally, but, leaving his party and his veteran's flag behind, he slips into Berlin's empty Gloria Palais. "Then, before the film began &#x02013; my first and last film in Berlin&#x02014;said Grandfather&#x02014;I played my life as a cinemagoer to my inner eye, beginning with my very first picture. Some went by quickly, some slowly, some completely stopped" (<i>FE</i>, 226). The film he saw "and was to rave about until his death was of course <i>Gone with the Wind</i>"; returning to the rally, he listens to Hitler, while thinking about Scarlett O'Hara. Not long after this, he is killed in an explosion in the cinema in his home town.

Grandfather at seventy said: In the beginning was the light. The light was switched off. I stood in front of the screen, all alone. I looked into the audience. There weren't many of them there.

We lined the gate with black velvet to slow the film. Even that damaged it. Also, they got old and worn. Grandfather took me by the hand. He said it wasn't the shaking projection that made everything tremble. Nor was it people's breathing. It was the heartbeat of the man who was supervising everything, the film explainer's, mine.

The writer on cinema, in its first decades, was a "film explainer" of a very particular kind. "Discourse about the cinema" was the phrase Christian Metz used in his account of cinema's "third machine," the sphere, additional to those of the industry and the spectator, of the <i>cinematic writer </i>(critic, historian, theoretician).<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Such discourse, inflected in very particular ways in the silent period, can, I would argue, be understood as a form of "talking in the cinema."
</p>

<p>
This is nicely literalized in the first English-language book of film theory, the American poet Vachel Lindsay's <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, first published in 1915, and revised in 1922. In the revised version, Lindsay referred to a passage of his original text in which "I suggest suppressing the orchestra entirely and encouraging the audience to talk about the film."

No photoplay people have risen to contradict this theory, but it is a chapter that once caused me great embarrassment. With Christopher Morley, the well-known author of Shandygaff and other temperance literature, I was trying to prove out this chapter. As soon as the orchestra stopped, while the show rolled on in glory, I talked about the main points in this book, illustrating it by the film before us. Almost everything that happened was a happy illustration of my ideas. But there were two shop girls in front of us awfully in love with a certain second-rate actor who insisted on kissing the heroine every so often, and with her apparent approval. Every time we talked about that those shop girls glared at us as though we were robbing them of their time and money. Finally one of them dragged the other out into the aisle, and dashed out of the house with her dear chum, saying, so all could hear: "Well, come on, Terasa, we might as well go, if these two talking <i>pests</i> are going to keep this up behind us." The poor girl's voice trembled. She was in tears. She was 

<b></b>

gone before we could apologize or offer flowers. So I say in applying this chapter, in our present state of civilization, sit on the front seat, where no one can hear your whispering but Mary Pickford on the screen. She is but a shadow there, and will not mind.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
The story's gendered divide (the absorbed shop-girls and the running commentary of the men) bears an interesting relationship to the narratives of "talking in the cinema," in which a demotic <i>feminine</i> speech tends to operate as a model of distracted viewing.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  My present focus is on the ways in which the scene in Lindsay's text, too, is shadowed by the film lecturer or film explainer, who, in the early years of cinema, provided a spoken commentary to accompany films as they were projected. Film historians have discussed the continuities between the magic-lantern lecturer of the late nineteenth century and the moving picture commentator of the first years of cinema; early "film lectures" would indeed have included both lantern slides and moving pictures. In the U.S., film lecturing largely appears to have died out in the early 1910s with, as critics including Tom Gunning and Rick Altman have argued, functions previously filled by lectures now folded into narrative technique and an increasing use of intertitles.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  There would also have been a greater use of accompanying written material, including printed synopses, so that spectators would ideally be familiar with the outlines of the film narrative before the film; they would come to the theater, in the scenarist and early writer on film Epes W. Sargent's words, "with the facts predigested as it were and . . . ready for the silent running of the reel."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Writers about cinema in its first decades inherited something of the role of the commentator on the unfolding action of the film. While narrative and explanatory functions relating to a specific film may have been transmuted into broader formal and aesthetic questions, early writers on film nonetheless retained a significant didactic role, pointing to ways of seeing appropriate to the new medium of film, and, as Altman has argued of early film lecturing, not so much <i>explaining</i> the visual as <i>redefining </i>the images according to an alternate set of rules (<i>SFS</i>, 71&#x02013;2). If, moreover, film required from spectators new visual and interpretative skills, it also seemed to demand that writers on the cinema find discursive strategies adequate to the new art and technology&#x02014;in particular, its powers of motion, its abilities to create a total (virtual) world in which, as Virginia Woolf was to write in her 1926 essay "The Cinema," "[w]e see life as it is when we have no part in it"&#x02014;and the intensity of its appeal to the eye.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
From the writings of Henri Bergson onwards, the philosophy of film has been focused on the paradoxical relationship between the immobile image and the mobility of the projected film, in part as a way of theorizing consciousness and time consciousness, in particular. One of my concerns is with the ways in which this paradox&#x02014;of stasis and mobility&#x02014;was negotiated in the "talking about the cinema" of critics and theorists. <i>Photog&#x000E9;nie</i> was a key term for French film theorists of the 1910s and 1920s; it was variously described as a form of defamiliarization, as a seeing of ordinary things as for the first time, and as a temporal category, a sublime instant. The French avant-garde film-maker and theorist Jean Epstein wrote that "the value of the photogenic is measured in seconds," though what it flashes up also exists, he wrote, in an impossible 

<b></b>

or illusory time, that of the present:<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  "The future 'I' is shed as 'I' past: the present is merely this instantaneous and perpetual sloughing. The present is merely an encounter. The cinema is the only art capable of depicting the present as it is."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  <i>Photog&#x000E9;nie</i> also became synonymous with screen or cinematic "beauty," a beauty of "the moment" or "the interval," glimpsed rather than held. As Louis Delluc wrote, in an article on "Beauty in the Cinema" : "For a long time, I have realized that the cinema was destined to provide us with impressions of evanescent eternal beauty, since it alone offers us the spectacle of nature and sometimes even the spectacle of real human activity."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Issues of time, duration and movement were thus inextricably intertwined with aesthetic questions, and with attempts to define the specific aesthetic of the cinema, which was at times, as for Delluc, differentiated from the properties of the artwork, since its proclaimed abilities to capture reality were held to put it on the side of nature and life rather than that of art.
</p>

<p>
For the French art historian Elie Faure, writing on the art of cinema in the early 1920s, <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i> was both shock or "commotion" and recognition: "The revelation of what the cinema of the future can be came to me one day: I retain an exact memory of it, of the commotion that I experienced when I observed, in a flash, the magnificence there was in the relationship of a piece of black clothing to the grey wall of an inn."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Here the aesthetic of film is rendered as a form of visuality quite distinct from plot and narrative: the essence of film is pure image, and it inheres in the instant, "in a flash." Faure's account, however, produces a complex model of cinematic time and duration; the image is retained as an "exact memory," thus becoming, in effect, an "afterimage." There are echoes here of Goethe's <i>Theory of Colour, </i>in which afterimages are represented as "physiological colours":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I had entered an inn towards evening, and, as a well-favoured girl, with a brilliantly fair complexion, black hair, and a scarlet bodice, came into the room, I looked attentively at her as she stood before me at some distance in half shadow. As she presently afterwards turned away, I saw on the white wall, which was now before me, a black face surrounded with a bright light, while the dress of the perfectly distinct re appeared of a beautiful sea-green.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Faure's account transmuted Goethe's colour theory into the monochromatic field of the film, and his eroticized vision into the metonymic purity of cloth and wall. Nonetheless, there is for both writers the perception that, in Mary Ann Doane's words, "the afterimage is accessible only through an experience of intensity, of dazzlement."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
If on the one hand the model of <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i> served to isolate a cinematic essence as a sublime instant, to extract the image from the flow, on the other "talking about the cinema" seemed to demand adequation to the "movement" or "motion" that also served to define the qualities of the new art of the film. The film critic Robert Herring's <i>Films of the Year 1927&#x02013;1928</i> (which appears strongly indebted to the pictorial criticism of Vachel Lindsay and Victor Freeburg, discussed later in this article) was a collection of stills aimed at providing "a permanent record" of those "striking scenes [that] flash across the screen for an instant and then remain only as a memory": "Movement 

<b></b>

is life," he writes, "and the cinema is the only art that can preserve this quality in its expression. Yet, for doing this, it suffers . . . . A film is projected at the rate of twenty-two pictures a second; much must be unnoticed, much must flash by before we have grasped its essence."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The movement that defines cinema (as it comes so often to define modernity itself) is also a more fragile and unstable ephemerality that inheres at every level, from the fleeting nature of the projected images to the vagaries of cinematic exhibition. In Herring's words: "A movie is perhaps pre-released. It is then shown everywhere, at once, for a week. Then it is nowhere any more. If you are a day too late you may never see it again, unless you track it down to some village hall or find it by the seaside, drearily" (<i>FY</i>, 1). It was in substantial part the anxiety over the mutability of the medium and its exhibition which, from the 1920s onwards, led to the establishment of such institutional spaces for cinema as the film societies, the new film journals, and, in the 1930s, the first film archives. There are significant connections between these sites of cinematic culture, the conceptual, literary and philosophical understandings of the filmic medium, and theories of modernity more broadly.
</p>

<p>
Such connections were made explicit in a number of works on film art in the first decades of the twentieth century, as was the concern with the ways in which critical discourse could provide a satisfactory account of filmic movement and representation. Eric Elliott's 1928 study <i>Anatomy of Motion Picture Art</i> addressed directly the problems attendant upon writing about film. In Elliott's words, "the experience of one observer is necessarily limited. He may read a book at his convenience but a film, like time and tide, waits for no man, and passes out of existence even while he is dutifully engaged in making observation of another."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  A correlation, present in many other studies written in this period, existed between the ephemeral screen-image and the ephemeral film as a whole, linked in complex ways to the illusion of screen-motion itself, whereby still photographic images appear as moving ones. For Robert Herring, writing, like Elliott, about attempts to commit films to memory: "it is unsatisfying, and it does not tend towards critical balance, to sit in a state of suspense, waiting for one scene, trying to carry it away intact and probably being impressed by a new group and another pattern" (<i>FY</i>, 1).
</p>

<p>
"Coming to the fluent expressions possible in screen continuity," Elliott wrote, "one is at a loss how to explain in words the appeal they make." Verbal description, he argued, might not be "fully adequate to interpret the appeal of a painting," but "where there are accepted terms relating to the initiated a sense of the original impressions, there is none at all relating to the screen . . . Again, the film is not merely a succession of scenes that can be described separately and consecutively; it is not so much the individual expression as the expression of all combined that results in the cinematic effect" (<i>AMPA</i>, 49). Herring concurs: "The cinema places before us not a series of patterns one after the other, but a moving, flowing design" (<i>FY</i>, 4).
</p>

<p>
The problems, it would seem, were manifold and self-perpetuating. The absence of established terms for this new art meant that it eluded the critical grasp and gaze. As Herring wrote of the cinema: "The transience of its creation makes serious consideration difficult and demands a quickness of apprehension not always forthcoming 

<b></b>

from those used to more static forms" (<i>FY</i>, 1). At the same time, aesthetic categories deriving from, and addressed to, the static and the verbal arts were, for many commentators, perceived to be inadequate to the mobile, visual representations of film. At a different level of cultural life, the absence of an archive or cinemath&#x000E8;que meant that there was often difficulty in seeing films more than once. Thus viewing became a form of erasure, and the film, once seen, "passes out of existence." It could not even be recalled adequately in memory, because, Elliott asserted, "Scientific tests have shown that not more than sixty per cent. of a film is seen by the spectator"; attention is "diverted from its material elements and the technique of its scenes" and towards the "values of story, character and personality" (<i>AMPA</i>, 16). The attractions of narrative, Elliott suggested, occluded the visual qualities of the film. At yet another level, there was instability and variation in the exhibition of films, which could be edited differently according to localities and at the behest of censorship.
</p>

<p>
The imperative critical task, then, was to establish forms of persistence and permanence&#x02014;aesthetic and archival&#x02014;that would nonetheless do justice to film's mobility and the fleeting quality of its medium. As the film critic Iris Barry enjoined her readers in her 1926 study <i>Let's Go to the Pictures</i>: "I ask then: critics arise, invent terms, lay down canons, derive from your categories, heap up nonsense with sense, and, when you have done, the cinemas will still be open and we can all flock in as proudly as we do now to the theatre and the opera, which indeed it is regarded as meritorious and noble to support."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
One way of capturing the "essence" of the mobile medium was to focus on the film still. For Robert Herring, the isolation of the still from the moving whole was justified by the perception that film's significance lies in its patterning of images. "What one remembers," he wrote, "of [Chaplin's] <i>A Woman of Paris</i> is not the story, but the treatment, and the treatment gave rise to a string of such symbols as Menjou's handkerchief. We remember the lit windows of the train, a dress collar, a necklace flung out of a window, some chocolates and a serviette full of holes" (<i>FY</i>, 3). The film still, in this account, would seem to be an appropriate way of seeing, or a mnemonic for, the objects, or part-objects, in which the film's "themes" are contained. Moreover, focusing attention on the pictorial or, more precisely, photogenic qualities of the "scene" was a way of diverting attention away from narrative, character and story, and hence of training the spectator in specifically visual modes of apprehension. Herring's brief comments on each of the stills he selected (from films including Murnau's <i>Faust</i>, Galison's <i>The Student of Prague</i>, Hitchcock's <i>The Lodger</i>, Borzage's <i>Seventh Heaven </i>and Man Ray's <i>Emak Bakia</i>) emphasized chiaroscuro effects and the interplay of vertical and horizontal planes. The focus on the film still was, nonetheless, framed in strategic terms; movement, for Herring as for so many other writers on film, continued to define the art of the cinema.
</p>

<p>
The question of vision and cinema's singular appeal to the eye persisted into the transition period of the late 1920s and beyond, even in discussion of those late silent films possessing a significant aural dimension. Walther Ruttmann's <i>Berlin</i>, is, as its subtitle indicates, the "symphony of a city," expressing, as Steven Connor has argued, "the 

<b></b>

sense of visuality passing across into aural form."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  F. W. Murnau's <i>Sunrise</i>, sub-titled "A Song of Two Humans," clearly revealed that a film's pictorial qualities could co-exist with both the representation of movement and engagement with the auditory. Yet, for the majority of commentators in the period, "beauty" was identified with "silence," drawing on a longstanding aesthetic credo in which silence is equated with universal and enduring values. The "silent forms" of Keats's Grecian Urn (whose lineaments were traced in early accounts of film as a return to Graeco-Egyptian art) lead us back to the question of the "moment" captured in the work of art, which both represents all time, and takes us out of contingency, time and history.
</p>

<p>
In the context of French avant-garde criticism, as I have noted, "beauty" became near-synonymous with <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i>, in which concept was also to be found the aspiration, as Leo Charney writes, "to remove the moment from the flow and flux of time and, like the frame of the painting, declare: This is the present moment, right here, right now."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In this sense, concepts of eternal value and of the moment independent of time and change could co-exist with the "modernist" focus on the isolated moment. Baudelaire's much-quoted assertion in his essay "The Painter of Modern Life" is apposite here: "By 'modernity' I mean the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"Beauty" in the cinema also has this dual or paradoxical dimension. Writing in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, the critic Martha Kinross asserted: "Architecture, sculpture, painting are static arts. Even in literature "our flying minds," as George Meredith says, cannot contain protracted description. But moments of fleeting beauty too transient to be caught by any means less swift than light itself are registered on the screen."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The concept of "fleeting beauty" can be identified with the modernist effort, in Charney's words, "to seize a moment on the terms of its evanescence."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  It contains an echo of Walter Pater's account, in the conclusion to <i>The Renaissance</i>, of "that continual vanishing away, that strange, perpetual, weaving and unweaving of ourselves."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Yet behind Pater there is Plato, and, in particular, Plato's <i>Phaedrus</i>, with its allegory of an earthly beauty (the beauty of the human body) which acts as a reminder to the beholder of Beauty, "true beauty," in the heavenly realm from which he has fallen. Film, too, is a doubled world, and, in the idealizing language of much early film writing, it is as if the film world offers "glimpses" of pure forms through the lifted veil or screen. This is then linked to the fleeting or evanescent qualities of such "glimpses" as an effect of filmic movement. "Platonist beauty" and "modern beauty" are intertwined.

<p class="noIndent">
In turning now to the ways in which cinematic "beauty" is taken up in early American film criticism, my focus will be a group of texts written and published in the U.S. in the 1910s and 1920s: Vachel Lindsay's <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i> (1915, extended edition 1922) and <i>Progress and Poetry in the Movies</i> (written in 1925, but unpublished in Lindsay's lifetime); Hugo M&#x000FC;nsterberg's <i>The Art of the Photoplay</i>  and Victor 0. Freeburg's <i>The Art of Photoplay Making</i>  and <i>Pictorial Beauty on the Screen</i> 

<b></b>

. The founding of "film studies" as a discipline can also be located here: Victor Freeburg taught the first courses on Photoplay Composition at the Columbia University School of Journalism in the mid-1910s, and founded the Columbia Composers Club in 1916. (The term "photoplay" had been arrived at after the Essanay film production company sponsored a contest in 1910 to select the most appropriate name for the new medium.) Lindsay, M&#x000FC;nsterberg and Freeburg were very much aware of their status as pioneers in the field and of each other's work, so that an internal dialogue or "conversation" often developed within and between their respective studies. While there were some significant differences between their approaches to film, they were also linked by the perception that the pursuit and the apprehension of beauty in the photoplay was a crucial dimension in the development of the mass art of cinema.
</p>

<p>
If Lindsay is known today, it is most often as a populist poet, who, by the time he was working on <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, had published two collections: <i>The Congo and Other Poems</i> and <i>Adventures while Preaching the Gospel of Beauty</i>. His writing had been taken up by Harriet Monroe and published in <i>Poetry</i> magazine in 1913; aligned, for a period, with the Imagists, Lindsay would propose an "Imagist photoplay" in <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, which would, in his words, bring "Doric restraint" (a term that echoes throughout H. D.'s film articles for <i>Close Up</i>) into the "overstrained" and "overloaded" world of even the finest photoplays (<i>AMP</i>, 158). Lindsay called his most successful poetry the "Higher Vaudeville," and he was in effect a performance poet, who, at the height of his popularity, travelled the length and breadth of America giving readings. Born in Springfield, Illinois, the mid-Western town which remained the center of his communitarian and localist politics, Lindsay had studied at the Chicago Institute of Art (1901&#x02013;1903) and subsequently at the New York School of Art (1903&#x02013;1908). One of his teachers in New York was Robert Henri, a central re in the "Ashcan School" of art, and his fellow students included George Bellows, Rockwell Kent and Edward Hopper. Lindsay achieved no great success as an art student&#x02014;Henri encouraged him to pursue his poetry rather than his drawing. But the terms of "beauty" in his writings undoubtedly had as one of their contexts the claims, in the first years of the century, for the new forms of beauty awaiting discovery by artists in modern American cities, translated in Lindsay's conceptual schema into "democratic beauty."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In a letter written at the beginning of 1915 to George Brett, editor-in-chief at Macmillan's, Lindsay outlined his new book, whose working title was "The Higher Criticism of the Movies":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
My particular equipment for writing this book is ten years of Art Education the last three of which were spent (winters) in lecturing in the Metropolitan Museum. My fundamental proposition is that the highest type of movie is a <i>picture</i> not a drama&#x02014;the movie-theatre is at best an Art-Gallery not a play-house. I am proving it out a hundred ways . . . [Movies] are as revolutionary in our age as the invention of Hieroglyphics was to the cave-man. And they can be built up into a great pictorial art. The Egyptian Tomb-painting was literally nothing but enlarged Hieroglyphics. We now have Hieroglyphics in motion&#x02014;and they can be made as lovely as the Egyptian if we once understand what we are doing.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Lindsay's "hieroglyphic" model of film language is perhaps the best-known aspect of his film writings.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Reaching back to the American Transcendentalist fascination with hieroglyphics (as in the writings of Poe, Emerson and, later, Whitman), both as a unity of pictures and words and as a form of occulted knowledge, Lindsay's "hieroglyphs" would also seem to echo or to anticipate a whole gamut of accounts of cinematic representation. These accounts combine, or create a space between, word and image, and include Jean Epstein's references to film as Egyptian hieroglyphics and Eisenstein's writings on the filmic ideogram, extending also to writers of the Frankfurt School, notably Kracauer and Adorno with their interest in "mass-cultural hieroglyphics."
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, as in his subsequent writings on cinema, particularly <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies </i>(unpublished in his lifetime), and in his poetry, Lindsay spelled out his vision of modern America (with its advertisements, bill-boards, newspaper photographs, sign-writings) as "a hieroglyphic civilization far nearer to Egypt than to England" (<i>AMP</i>, 12).<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  He analyzed a set of Egyptian hieroglyphs, their Roman letter equivalents, and their equivalents in "the moving-picture alphabet,"and wrote that "It is sometimes out of the oldest dream that the youngest vision is born." The photoplay audience that uses "the hieroglyphic hypothesis in analyzing the film before it, will . . . . find a promise of beauty in what have been properly classed as mediocre and stereotyped productions" (<i>AMP,</i> 121).
</p>

<p>
Lindsay's concept of the "hieroglyph" often appears to be interchangeable with that of "symbol," and <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i> attempted to produce a fixed and universal lexicon. The most interesting result of Lindsay's hieroglyphic preoccupations was, perhaps, his reading (in <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i>) of <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i>, a 1924 film starring Douglas Fairbanks, which reworked the tales of the Arabian Nights. He found there, in Michael North's words, "a self-reflexive parable of the hieroglyphic ancestry of the movies. The three treasures on which the drama turns&#x02014;a magic crystal, a flying carpet, and a golden apple&#x02014; . . . are self-reflexive representations of the powers added to human experience by photography: the power of the crystal to see far away, of the carpet to travel to distant places, of the apple to revive the dead."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  This conjoining of myth and medium can also be found in Lindsay's preoccupation with an "originary" transformative power of the film, continued into narrative cinema, as in his fascination with fairy-tales in which inanimate objects come to life and stasis becomes motion. At points in his texts, Lindsay sought to conjure, through his discourse, the still images of the art gallery into cinematic movement and life. At such moments, he seemed to be emulating, in his narrative, the powers of those late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century presenters of projected images, whose shows would depict the interplay between stasis and motion, the sudden animation of the still image, and the metamorphoses (of objects and spatial relations) that movement, or the appearance of movement, could effect.
</p>

<p>
I quoted earlier Lindsay's model of "conversation" in the cinema, as a way of illustrating the claim that early film critics were film explainers of a kind. Lindsay's is a highly performative text: "And so my commentary, New Years' Day, 1922, proceeds, using for points of more and more extensive departure the refrains and old catch-phrases 

<b></b>

of books two and three" (<i>AMP</i>, 5). After the publication of <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, he began to give film lectures as well as poetry readings, and on occasions the two modes would be combined. He referred repeatedly to "proving" his theoretical arguments on a film as it was screened. In <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i> he gave an exhaustive reading of <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i>, writing: "If Douglas Fairbanks will not consider it presumption, I would say that his film proves my book [<i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>] and my book proves his film" (<i>PPM, </i>172). His review of M&#x000FC;nsterberg's <i>The Photoplay: A Psychological Study</i> described it as an "unintentional guide book to the newest photoplay experiment, [D. W. Griffith's] <i>Intolerance</i>"; he recommended to his readers two screenings of <i>Intolerance</i> between two readings of M&#x000FC;nsterberg's book.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  "Conversation," for Lindsay, was thus a reference to the running commentary of the film spectator as explainer and the explanatory discourse of the film critic and theoretician. It was also connected to the "hieroglyphic" language of the film. As Lindsay wrote: "Moving objects, not moving lips, make the words of the photoplay" (<i>AMP,</i> 110).
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i> (which Lindsay called "an open letter to Griffith and the producers and actors he has trained" [<i>AMP,</i> 124]) photoplays are divided into three kinds. The Photoplay of Action (the simplest example of which would be the chase-film) is defined as Sculpture-in-motion. The Intimate Photoplay (the film of <i>Enoch Arden</i> is the example here) is Painting-in-Motion. The Photoplay of Splendor (fairy splendor, crowd splendor&#x02014;as in D. W. Griffith's <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>&#x02014;patriotic splendor, religious splendor) is <i>Architecture-in-motion</i>. The three types (Action, Intimacy, Splendor) were further correlated with pantomime, personal gesture, and the total gestures of crowds respectively. If a literary analogue were required, Lindsay suggested, his readers might think in terms of the dramatic, the lyric and the epic, but the overarching schema mapped the moving picture onto the visual and plastic arts. "This book," he wrote, "tries to find that fourth dimension of architecture, painting, and sculpture, which is the human soul in action, that arrow with wings which is the flash of fire from the film, or the heart of man, or Pygmalion's image, when it becomes a woman" (<i>AMP</i>, 21).

As in the art criticism and aesthetic theories of the eighteenth-century aestheticians Joachim Winckelmann and Gotthold Lessing (whose <i>Laoco&#x000F6;n </i>[1766] was repeatedly invoked in early writing about film, primarily in discussions of film's relationship to the other arts), sculpture was represented as arrested movement. Lindsay wrote: "An occasional hint of a Michelangelo re or gesture appears for a flash in the films . . . Suppose the seated majesty of Moses should rise, what would be the quality of the action ? . . . Is it not possible to have a Michelangelo of photoplay sculpture?" (<i>AMP, </i>73&#x02013;4). The relationship between stasis and movement translated into the desire to put (or the fantasy of putting) into motion the still, or stilled, tableau or sculpture and the momentary stilling of the moving picture into beautiful scenes: "Action Picture romance," Lindsay wrote, "comes when each hurdle is a tableau, when there is indeed an art-gallery-beauty in each one of these swift glimpses: when it is a race, but with a proper and golden-linked grace from action to action, and the goal is the most beautiful glimpse in the whole reel" (<i>AMP, </i>27).

<p>
What was the relationship of the "glimpse" of beauty and the "flash" of fire to the question of the still and the moving image? Lindsay's concept of Beauty, as in his "Gospel of Beauty," was central to his understanding of democracy and religion, part of his "subscription to the remedial impact of visual beauty."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  It was also inseparable from, and complicated by, his desire for female beauty. "I am the one poet," he wrote in the opening pages of the 1922 edition of <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, "who has a right to claim for his muses Blanche Sweet, Mary Pickford and Mae Marsh" (all of whom were early Biograph actresses) (<i>AMP</i>, 4). These "muses," then, come to re or embody the new Muse, the Tenth Muse, the Muse of film.

<p>
"Why do the people love Mary [Pickford]?," asked Lindsay:
</p>

Because of a certain aspect of her face in her highest mood. Botticelli painted her portrait many centuries ago when by some necromancy she appeared to him in this phase of herself . . .

Because the mob catch the very glimpse of it in Mary's face, they follow her night after night into the films.

"Glimpse" is an interesting word. We can say that something "glimpses": it shines faintly or intermittently, it glimmers or glitters&#x02014;thus the moon "glimpses" between the trees. Or we can say that we catch a "glimpse" of the moon between the trees. In fact, we tend to abbreviate this and say that we "glimpse" the moon between the trees, though it is in fact the moon doing the glimpsing, not us. In the context of early writing about film, ambiguities in subject-object relations and in the hierarchy of the various "looks" of the film (of the camera, actor, spectator), in addition to the anthropomorphizing of the object-world effected by the film, were connected to the representation of the cinematic image as a revelation, as in Elie Faure's "Cineplastics" essay or Virginia Woolf's "The Cinema," in which she wrote that: "Sometimes at the cinema, in the midst of its immense dexterity and enormous technical proficiency, the curtain parts and we behold, far off, some unknown and unexpected beauty. But it is for a moment only."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Beauty, like <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i>, (and, as I have suggested, <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i> is in a sense "Beauty") thus appears to have a temporal dimension, defined, as it was for Epstein, as a value on the order of the second. It could be found, as it would often seem to be for Lindsay, in the cinematic image as a composition, a tableau, or as an interval.

<p>
In <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i>, Lindsay wrote of American modernity, with its "extreme fanaticism in the worship of raw light and raw action":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

I would venture upon another proverb: "Time must alternate with Eternity." Let me go farther into the parable, and say: "The sun makes time, makes machinery"; by it we regulate every watch and every newspaper, every railway schedule, every factory time-clock&#x02014;all those things that cut our nerves up into bits, 1/16 of an inch, no shorter, no longer . . . Action and speed and blazing light must alternate with moments of mellowness and rest. Even between each heart-beat, there is a split-second of absolute rest, which the American spirit would deny. It is the American idea to destroy that split-second of rest, which is between every heart-beat . . . No one to whom the moon is sufficiently dear will permit his nerves to be chopped into little pieces 1/16 of an inch long, and no longer, nor his time chopped into little pieces 1/16 of a second long, and no longer.

This image was taken up later in Lindsay's manuscript in a brief discussion of Chaplin's artistry, located in his films' "intimate passages, some of them not longer than the split second between every heart-beat, but long enough to give the touch of eternity in time, the hint of moonlight interrupting broad sunlight" (<i>PPM</i>, 271). The heart-beat (and we might recall here the heartbeat which concludes Gert Hofmann's <i>The Film Explainer</i>)was a way of giving human, bodily measure to mechanized modern time and to cinematic time (filming or projection at sixteen frames a second). For Lindsay, film would seem to be both continuous with the world of "action and speed and blazing light" and resistant to it, in its imagined creation of "rests" or intervals, whose identity overlapped with that of the passages through which "beauty" could be "glimpsed." The rhythms of modernity are heterogeneous and plural.
</p>

<p>
His account finds a curious echo in the late twentieth-century writings of Paul Virilio, in which the contrast between modernity and postmodernity is often predicated on the idea that the greater the speed of the image, the more absolute the loss of a contextualized time, and in which we find a nostalgia for a slower speed of projection/representation. Charting the shift from "truth 16 times a second" in the chronophotography of the nineteenth-century pioneer Jules-Etienne Marey to film's "truth 24 times a second" (as proclaimed by Jean-Luc Godard), Virilio writes: "the development of high technical speeds would result in the disappearance of consciousness as the direct perception of phenomena that inform us of our own existence." The destruction of human consciousness, Virilio suggests, comes with the closure of the interval, temporal and spatial, between the representation and what it records.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Writing of the "beautiful picture" in the first decades of film history, in the context of a discussion of documentary cinema, the avant-garde film maker and theorist Hans Richter argued that its advent "marked the cinema's first direct overtures to the artistic climate of the period&#x02014;to the tradition of the bourgeois arts . . . The cinema took over painting&#x02014;and the poetry of the painted image took over the cinema." The creation of the "beautiful" image, Richter suggested, came at the expense of "a closeness to reality," producing a "contradiction between beautiful image and social task."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The claims for "beauty" in Lindsay's writings (as in Freeburg's and M&#x000FC;nsterberg's) were clearly linked to the granting of a high art status to film, in the ways in which Richter critiques. Nonetheless, it would seem that, for Lindsay in particular, "beauty" was also credited with the "social task" of giving human measure to modern time, and of penetrating the seductive surfaces of modernity. In Lindsay's <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i>, the "glimpse" (of beauty) was contrasted, though the distinction was not absolute, with the "magical glitter" that created a continuum between the film, the plate glass windows of commodity culture and the glass architecture of the modern city:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Now this impression of looking into a crystal, which gives a magical glitter to everything within it, is the impression a true movie should convey . . . The first story of the principal streets is becoming all glass. It is not the glass itself that is desirable in the eyes of the American. It is the film of light upon the surface of the glass which has become his luxury . . . This madness of the crystalline is getting to be more and more a habit of the American eye.

<p class="noIndent">

While "the glimpse" and "glitter" are both forms of "beauty," the former was not held to be collusive with a commodified modern time and modern vision. In this sense the "glimpse of beauty" in the film could be said to anticipate some of the perceived functions of a montage aesthetic, which disrupts surfaces (through fragmentation, collision or the creation of new conceptual relationships) and "awakens" the spectator.
</p>

<p>
In his foreword to <i>The Art of Photoplay Making</i> , Victor Freeburg wrote that his study was based on lectures delivered at Columbia University between 1915 and 1917 and on the newspaper articles he wrote for the <i>New York Times</i> and other publications. He suggested that his readers have three books to hand: Epes Winthrop Sargent's <i>Techniques of the Photoplay</i> <i>, </i>Hugo M&#x000FC;nsterberg's <i>The Photoplay</i> and Vachel Lindsay's <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, "which makes it perfectly clear that a motion picture, if properly thought out and manufactured, will contain the kind of beauty which we used to look for only in paintings and sculpture."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The preface to <i>Pictorial Beauty on the Screen</i>  pursues the theme: "If I look upon a motion picture as a kind of substitute for some stage play or novel, it seems to me a poor thing, only a substitute for something better; but if I look upon it as something real in itself, a new form of pictorial art in which things have somehow been conjured into significant motion, then I get many a glimpse of touching beauty, and I always see a great range of possibilities for richer beauties in future examples of this new art. Then I see the motion picture as the equal of any of the elder arts."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Though less idiosyncratic and less overtly polemical than Lindsay's film writings, Freeburg's two books were also attempts to both describe and prescribe for an aesthetics of cinema, taking a classical and formalist approach to the nature of art and the question of beauty, and giving unity the highest aesthetic value. "What the photoplay world needs at present," Freeburg wrote, "is more definite canons of criticism" (<i>TAPM</i>, 5). Such canons, he implied, were particularly to be desired given that "the momentary, flashing nature of exhibition and the psychology of the crowd give the spectator little opportunity or desire to exercise his intellectual faculties" (<i>TAPM</i>, 18). Moreover, they would help to secure for film its enduring qualities: "Let us constantly remember that if our photoplay is to become a classic it must possess beneath the attractive surface which appeals to the crowd the permanent values of illuminating truth, universal meaning, and unfading beauty" (<i>TAPM</i>, 25). Freeburg's account of film and its significance was intended to produce a counter-discourse to that of popular and commercial cinematic attractions, particularly as they were constructed in the movie and fan magazines. Thus his theories dissolved actors and "stars" into shape and shadow&#x02014;"We are merely thinking of [actors] as moving shapes upon a screen" (<i>PBS, </i>44)&#x02014;while he insisted that the film director was "the legitimate master in movie making" (<i>PBS, </i>154), as creator and artist.
</p>

<p>
The interplay between mobility and fixity, "movement" and "moment," stasis and fluency, underlies <i>The Art Of Photoplay Making</i>. The arts, Freeburg argued, can be divided into two categories: the static forms of the painter, sculptor and architect, which depend upon simultaneity and co-existence, and the "fluent" arts of the dancer, the orator and the musician, in which movement is "consecutive." Cinema, in his account, 

<b></b>

is concerned with both static and fluent forms. There is a quality of movement in film radically different to that of the other visual and plastic arts. "The visible stimuli" in painting, photography, sculpture or architecture "do not vanish while you look at them. They are there as long as you look, will be there tomorrow, and will remain constantly present to the eye as long as the art object endures." "But the motion picture is an ever originating series of ever vanishing aspects. And the composition of the photoplay is a combination of no-longer-seen pictures with being-seen-pictures with not-yet-seen pictures. In other words, the cinematic composition appeals simultaneously to the memory, the perception and the expectation of the beholder" (<i>TAPM</i>, 67).
</p>

<p>
Freeburg drew extensively in his film writings on contemporary research in physiological aesthetics and "the psychology of beauty," in which aesthetic preferences, for shape, color and form, were the subject of scientific and psychological experiment. The work of Ethel Puffer (author of <i>The Psychology of Beauty</i> [1907] and a student and, subsequently colleague, of Hugo M&#x000FC;nsterberg's) was a strong influence on both Freeburg's and M&#x000FC;nsterberg's film writing. For Puffer, "the beauty of an object lies in its permanent possibility of creating the perfect moment. The experience of this moment, the union of stimulation and repose, constitutes the unique aesthetic emotion."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  She explored the extent to which perceptions of balance and symmetry in pictures were determined by acts of "attention," a concept, central to late nineteenth- and twentieth-century psychology, also at the heart of M&#x000FC;nsterberg's theories of film and aligned by him with the filmic device of the close-up. Research in these areas, as explored in C. W. Valentine's <i>Experimental Psychology of Beauty</i> (referred to by Freeburg), was extended to the question of "suggested movement": "It seems possible," Valentine writes, "that pleasure may be found in the <i>suggestion</i> of movement by a line, if that suggestion is of the right kind."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> This is echoed in Freeburg's formulation "that movement in a photo-play may come from other things besides motions" (<i>PBS, </i>124).
</p>

<p>
In discussing the question "what is beauty?" in <i>The Art of Photoplay Making, </i>Freeburg referred his reader to the work of the writer, art historian and aesthetician Vernon Lee (the pseudonym of Violet Paget) and in particular to her study <i>The Beautiful </i>. In Lee's definition, which Freeburg quoted: "Beautiful means satisfactory for contemplative, ie <i>for reiterated perception</i>" (<i>TAPM</i>, 27). "The very essence of contemplative satisfaction," Lee continued, "is its desire for such reiteration."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  There are strong echoes here, too, of <i>Laoco&#x000F6;n</i>, in which Lessing wrote of the "single moment in ever-changing nature" to which the painter and sculpture are restricted; the moment must therefore be as suggestive as possible, while avoiding gestural excess. It is not, Lessing specified, "merely to be given a glance but to be . . . contemplated repeatedly and at length."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Freeburg, borrowing Lee's (and Lessing's) definitions, attempted to redefine the cinematographic in the terms of satisfied contemplation, reiterated perception, and thus Beauty. He sought out "repetition" through formal, spatial relations, repeated within individual shots and across the span of the film, and connected repetition in the photoplay with the use of the theme or motif in musical composition. "The photoplay," Freeburg wrote in <i>Pictorial Beauty on the Screen</i>, "needs repetition, especially because of the fact that any pictorial motion or moment must by 

<b></b>

its very nature vanish while we look . . . from our minds as well as from the screen." Repetition with difference was a way of "fix[ing] these fleeting values" without risk of monotony (<i>PBS, </i>107).
</p>

<p>
"Repetition," for Freeburg as for Lindsay, also became a question of repeated viewings of a single film. Lindsay wrote in <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i> of watching <i>The Thief of Bagdad </i>twenty times, while Freeburg asked rhetorically (in a coded reference, perhaps, to Vachel Lindsay's re for the most beautiful cinematic tableau; "the breaking of the tenth wave upon the sand" [<i>AMP</i>, 111]):
</p>

Has any reader of this book gone to see the same photoplay ten times? And if so, why? Was it because of some irresistible, undying lure in the content of that photoplay or in the pictorial form of that content? Did you go of your own free will? Did you ever make a sacrifice to see it the tenth time? If so, then you have known the calm joy of a reserve power in the newest of the arts.

<p>
"Reserve" was a central and multiply determined term, signifying decorative simplicity and "restraint," a containment, rather than an expenditure, of the spectator's psychical and physiological "energy," and "the emotion which comes over us at the overwhelming discovery that a given masterpiece of art has a wealth of beauty that we can never hope to exhaust." "Reserve," in Freeburg's arguments, also functioned as a counter to the "speed" that defined filmic movement and the "jazz" of the screen: "The hysterical extravagance of the movies is further illustrated in the breathless speed which so often characterizes every moving thing on the screen . . . It has nothing of that abiding joy which comes from the consciousness of restrained energy in art" (<i>PBS, </i>189&#x02013;90).
</p>

<p>
Rhythm, pictorial values, restraint, slowness of movement, "dynamic repose" (<i>PBS, </i>153), reserve and repetition were all represented as ways of holding back the speed and inexorable forward movement of the projected film, which came to stand for the relentless drive and "shock" effects of modernity itself. Speed, quick close-ups, "large violent movements on the screen" (<i>PBS, </i>38) and stark contrasts between black and white tones "hurt the eyes," producing "pictorial hysterics" (<i>PBS, </i>36). Acts of "attention," the work (or play) of "our eyes and minds" (<i>PBS</i>, 51), could, to an extent, Freeburg suggested, fix the fleeting instant, arresting the moment, arresting beauty: "At such times the whole pattern on the screen becomes as static as a painting, and its power or weakness, its beauty or lack of beauty, may be appreciated much as one would appreciate a design in a painting" (<i>PBS</i>, 51). Freeburg lamented, however, the impossibility of "rests," "blank periods" and "intervals" in cinematic projection and the absence in the film of visual equivalents to those silences, of varying lengths, which he held to be the most powerful aspects of musical rhythm and composition (<i>PBS</i>, 125).
</p>

<p>
"One would get a sense of movement," Freeburg wrote, "even if every scene in a photoplay were itself a fixed picture held for a few seconds on the screen" (<i>PBS, </i>124). The relationship between "moment" and "movement" was at the heart of his film theories: "Try to recall the pictorial aspects of the action in a play you saw years ago. What do you recall? Moments or movements? Rarely a movement, more often a moment. The psychology of this emphasis is usually simple enough. There was a 

<b></b>

momentary pause of the object just after completing, or just before beginning a movement" (<i>TAPM</i>, 31).
</p>

<p>
The "pause of the object" is in no way to be identified with the cut or the interval between film frames. To a significant extent, Freeburg sought in his film aesthetics an alternative line of development in moving picture technology, based on the pictorial tradition of the tableau, and running counter to contemporary celebrations of mechanization and speed.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Freeburg also attempted to disaggregate "movement" as mere mechanical motion from "movement" as connected to sensation and emotion, setting in train a contrast between motion and emotion that became a recurrent trope in the writing about cinema of the 1920s.
</p>

<p>
Vernon Lee's <i>The Beautiful</i> made one brief reference to the "cinematographic" in tandem with the "kaleidoscopic," as ways of describing a succession of aspects connected to non-aesthetic (practical, scientific) responses, as in a landscape "which is swished over by the mental eye as by an express train, only just enough seen to know what it was, or perhaps nothing seen at all, mere words filling up gaps in the train of thought" (<i>B, </i>13). Film itself, it would seem, did not re on her conceptual horizon. In <i>The Beautiful</i>, Lee outlined a theory of aesthetics and empathy (drawing on the work of Theodor Lipps). "Dramas," she wrote, "enacted by lines and curves and angles, take place not in the marble or pigment embodying those contemplated shapes, but solely in ourselves, in what we call our memory, imagination and feeling" (<i>B, </i>80&#x02013;1). She was substantially concerned with the question of "movement," and with the contrast between "the locomotion of things" and "the empathetic movement of lines" which, in her account, lay at the heart of the aesthetic experience. <i>The Beautiful</i> thus presented a moving world without the felt necessity of the moving image.
</p>

<p>
Lee's physiological aesthetics provide a connection to the theories of Hugo M&#x000FC;nsterberg, with whose work in the fields of aesthetics and psychology Lee was intensely, though at times critically, engaged. M&#x000FC;nsterberg, who left Germany for the U.S. in 1892 when William James invited him to take charge of the psychological laboratory at Harvard (where his students included the young Gertrude Stein) was centrally concerned with the psychology of vision and perception, though his extensive publications also included work on aesthetics, American culture, and the "applied psychology" of law, industry and advertising.
</p>

<p>
M&#x000FC;nsterberg published his account of the "new art" of the film, <i>The Photoplay: A Psychological Study, </i>in 1916. It was written during the summer of 1915, when M&#x000FC;nsterberg's personal and professional situation, as a patriotic German living in the U.S., was becoming increasingly untenable. In 1916, M&#x000FC;nsterberg died of heart failure at the age of fifty-three. As his daughter and biographer Margaret M&#x000FC;nsterberg wrote of <i>The Photoplay</i>: "In this new study M&#x000FC;nsterberg sought distraction for himself from the wearing anxieties caused by the international stress, and at the same time hoped to make the imagination of the public link his name with a more serene interest."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
M&#x000FC;nsterberg may have represented his "conversion" to the moving pictures as of recent date, but the preoccupations he brought to his writings about film were not.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  <i>The Photoplay</i> drew on a number of his longstanding interests; optical technologies and 

<b></b>

the physiology and psychology of perception; the philosophy of attention; the relationship between "inner" and "outer" realities; a neo-Kantian "aesthetic of isolation" and an affirmation of eternal and absolute values in art. These were all areas on which he had written extensively. He brought them to his analysis of an art which was defined on the basis of its newness, and whose departure, as he presented it, from existing aesthetic and, in particular, theatrical conventions became the essence of its independence: "We want to study the right of the photoplay, hitherto ignored by aesthetics, to be classed as an art in itself under entirely new mental life conditions."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The significant evolution and aim of the cinema tended, M&#x000FC;nsterberg began by suggesting, towards the provision of "a real substitute for the stage," its democratized version, and the reproduction of "the theatre performance without end." Yet it becomes clear that he perceived the true development of the photoplay as a departure from both the theater and the reproduction of reality. The moving pictures can produce a "rapid change of scenes" impossible, he argued, on the stage; the possibility of "allowing the eye to follow the hero and heroine continuously from place to place"; the ability to be "simultaneously here and there"; "a rapidity of motion which leaves actual men behind" (<i>TP, </i>60&#x02013;1). As readers, we are gradually led from the valuation of realism to that of illusionism: "Every dream becomes real, uncanny ghosts appear from nothing and disappear into nothing, mermaids swim through the waves, and little elves climb out of the Easter lilies" (<i>TP, </i>61).<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Yet even while "unheard of effects" were reached, the photoplay still "showed a performance . . . as it would go on in the outer world" (<i>TP</i>, 61). An entirely new perspective was reached, M&#x000FC;nsterberg argued, with the introduction of the close-up, which "leaves all stagecraft behind." It is at this juncture that the photoplay becomes "a new art which long since left behind the mere film reproduction of the theatre and which ought to be acknowledged in its own aesthetic independence. . . . A new aesthetic cocoon is broken; where will the butterfly's wings carry him?" (<i>TP</i>, 63). In his account of the evolution of the moving picture, then, the photoplay emerged into newness, after an embryonic period in which it was still to an extent in thrall to drama on the stage. It was, he suggested, "an independent art, controlled by aesthetic laws of its own, working with mental appeals which are fundamentally different from those of the theatre" (<i>TP, </i>64). Newness thus became synonymous with aesthetic autonomy.
</p>

<p>
In his section on "The Psychology of the Photoplay," M&#x000FC;nsterberg devoted separate chapters to "Depth and Movement," "Attention," "Memory and Imagination" and "Emotions," categories that echoed the chapter topics of William James's <i>The Principles of Psychology</i>. His interest lay here in "the mental processes which this specific form of artistic endeavour produces in us" (<i>TP</i>, 65). In his discussion of depth in the moving pictures he drew a sharp distinction between our "knowledge" that the objects on the screen have only two dimensions, and our "immediate impression" that they have depth: "We have no right whatever to say that the scenes which we see on the screen appear to us as flat pictures." As he wrote:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
<i>Depth and movement alike come to us in the moving picture world, not as hard facts but as a mixture of fact and symbol. They are present and yet they are not in the things. We invest the impressions with them.</i> The theater has both depth and motion, without any subjective help; the screen has them and yet lacks them. We see things distant and moving, but we furnish to them more than we receive; we create the depth and the continuity through our mental mechanism.

"<i>They are present and yet they are not in the things.</i>" In M&#x000FC;nsterberg's argument, we give more than we receive, and film spectatorship entails an encounter between an abundance of inner processes and "the world of impressions." "The best," he wrote, "does not come from without" (<i>TP</i>, 79). This view contrasts strikingly with those detractors of cinema for whom moving-image consumption was perceived as purely passive, as in T. S. Eliot's strictures in his essay "In Memoriam: Marie Lloyd," in which he wrote that, with the decay of the music-hall, the working-man goes to the cinema "where his mind is lulled by continuous senseless music and continuous action too rapid for the brain to act upon, and will receive without giving, in that same listless apathy with which the middle and upper classes regard any entertainment of the nature of art."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
M&#x000FC;nsterberg focused on those aspects of film technique which were also part of its "evolution." In his account, "depth and movement" were the primary attributes of the photoplay, and were inseparable from its double nature; it has and it does not have depth and movement. To this must be added&#x02014;as the photoplay began to add to its repertoire of representations&#x02014;"much more than the simple impression of moving and distant objects" (<i>TP</i>, 79). The close-up was to be understood as an "objectivation" of the most central of the internal functions "that create the meaning of the world around us"; that is, attention. The "cut-back" (a form of flash-back) is analogous to the workings of memory: "It is as if the outer world itself became moulded in accordance with our fleeting turns of attention or with our passing memory ideas" (<i>TP</i>, 90). "Gradual transitions . . . somewhat symbolize the appearance and disappearance of a reminiscence," while the rapid succession of scenes in the photoplay appear to us as simultaneously present, "fusing in our field of vision, just as they are brought together in our own consciousness" (<i>TP</i>, 92).
</p>

<p>
The last chapter in the section on psychology focused on emotions. In the structure of the text, the chapter on the "Emotions" in fact divides and connects the sections of the book on "psychology" and "aesthetics." M&#x000FC;nsterberg hypothesized a future for film in which, for example, (and along the model of a psychological experiment) a rocking camera would give to every motion "an uncanny whirling character," creating in "the mind of the spectator unusual sensations which produce a new shading of the emotional background" (<i>TP, </i>107). He thus sent, for a moment, an embodied, corporealized perception into whirling, vertiginous space before returning to the "laws" of aesthetics&#x02014;"isolation" and "detachment."

The final section of <i>The Photoplay</i> is an argument for aesthetic value as the overcoming of reality (<i>TP, </i>114): <i>"The work of art shows the things and events perfectly complete in themselves, freed from all connections which lead beyond their own limits, that is, in perfect isolation</i>" (<i>TP</i>, 117). "<i>The photoplay tells us the human story by overcoming </i>

<b></b>

<i>the forms of the outer world, namely, space, time, and causality, and by adjusting the events to the forms of the inner world, namely, attention, memory, imagination and emotion</i>"(<i>TP, </i>129). "We annihilate beauty when we link the artistic creation with practical interests and transform the spectator into a selfishly interested bystander" (<i>TP, </i>137). One question to be posed about M&#x000FC;nsterberg's text is whether his study of film was a further example of the way in which his psychophysiological preoccupations appeared in tandem with his idealist aesthetics, or whether cinema was perceived, and embraced, as the means by which the tensions between the two could finally be resolved.
</p>

<p>
M&#x000FC;nsterberg's study of film was more concentrated on questions of editing (and, by implication, on the issue of the spectator's engagement with filmic <i>narrative</i>) in the photoplay than Freeburg's writings, though both writers were concerned with models of spectatorial absorption and "attention." M&#x000FC;nsterberg shared with Lindsay a fascination with film's ability to produce the most rapid of alternations and alterations in space and time, through such devices as close-ups, parallel editing and dissolves; Lindsay, in his 1925 study, <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i>, quoted M&#x000FC;nsterberg extensively, and the film hieroglyph took on the aspect of the close-up. M&#x000FC;nsterberg also wrote far more positively than Freeburg of filmic speed and motion: "Not more than one sixteenth of a second is needed to carry us from one corner of the globe to the other, from a jubilant setting to a mourning scene. The whole keyboard of the imagination may be used to serve this emotionalizing of nature" (<i>TP, </i>103).
</p>

<p>
"Beauty" for M&#x000FC;nsterberg was not, as it was for Lindsay and Freeburg, "glimpsed" in those intervals which were, in Lindsay's words, "a pulse of the rhythm in the silence-of-time that we call the motion picture" (<i>PPM</i>, 201). For M&#x000FC;nsterberg, unlike Freeburg, the "unnatural rapidity" of the photoplay was represented as energizing, "heighten[ing] the feeling of vitality in the spectator" (<i>TP, </i>153). The film, in his account, moves to the measure of our own "fluttering and fleeting" mental states (<i>TP, </i>127), and beauty would seem to inhere in this symbiosis, and not in the attempt to arrest time and motion.
</p>

<p>
While the writers I have discussed do not mention the work of Henri Bergson in their film writings, his rejection of the "cinematographic mechanism of thought" in <i>Creative Evolution</i> would appear to be a highly significant conceptual context. Bergson argued that the cinematographic model spatializes and segments time, rather than understanding time as a vital flow into which human subjectivity could be inserted. As I have noted, Lindsay and Freeburg's counters to the "mechanical" movement of the cinematic frame were the pictorial image or tableau that could momentarily arrest time and the interval as the glimpse of beauty, while M&#x000FC;nsterberg postulated a mode of perception inextricably intertwined with our "mental mechanism." Moreover, his account of the filmic "cut-back," and its counterpart in the work of the mind, is suggestive of the concept of "thinking backwards" for which Bergson argued, claiming, in <i>Creative Evolution</i>, that such a process ran entirely counter to the relentless forward motion of the cinematic apparatus and that it reversed "the bent of our intellectual habits."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In the closing paragraph of his text M&#x000FC;nsterberg engaged with the question of "modern beauty," in his assertion that film "is a new form of true beauty in the turmoil of a modern age, created by its very technique and yet more than any other art destined to overcome outer nature by the free and joyful play of the mind" (<i>TP, </i>160). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
For all M&#x000FC;nsterberg's emphasis on flux, on the "fleeting" and "passing" that we have come to associate with modernist conceptions of time, identity and experience, and on the part played by human consciousness in shaping the operations of the film, an "aesthetic of isolation" continued to lie at the heart of his theories. This was also central to the writings of a number of his contemporaries, for whom cinema offered a world which duplicated our own, but which precluded the possibility of our interventions into it. Released from the demands of active and practical response, it was argued, we "see" more clearly.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  There is an anticipation here of the writings of the philosopher Stanley Cavell on cinema, particularly in his book <i>The World Viewed, </i>in which he explored the wish, particular to modernity, "for that specific simultaneity of presence and absence which only the cinema will satisfy."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The focus on "beauty," shared by Lindsay, Freeburg and M&#x000FC;nsterberg (and central to the avant-garde French film theory of the same period) was rarely pursued in subsequent film aesthetics. Indeed, as in the case of Hans Richter, quoted earlier, it was often perceived to be at odds with cinematic realism, or, as in the case of the Hungarian film theorist B&#x000E9;la Bal&#x000E1;zs, with the motion that defined film. Writing of "Dangerous Beauty," Bal&#x000E1;zs asserted:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Over-beautiful, picturesque shots are sometimes dangerous even if they are the result of good camera work alone. Their over-perfect composition, their self-sufficient closed harmony may lend them a static, painting-like character and thereby lift them out of the dynamic stream of the action. Such beauty has its own centre of gravity, its own frame and does not reach beyond itself to the preceding and the subsequent. "<i>Je hais le mouvement qui d&#x000E9;place les lignes</i>," wrote Baudelaire in his sonnet on beauty. But the film is art in motion.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The pictorial tradition in film and in film criticism has been largely written out of the debates and the histories, and the work of the critics discussed in this article was overlooked for many decades, though it resonated throughout the film criticism of the 1920s, often without acknowledgement. Recent modernist studies, with their tendency to equate film and montage aesthetics, have found little place for the writing of these early critics and theorists. Yet among the many interesting aspects of this early work is that, <i>contra</i> Bal&#x000E1;zs, it was precisely an attempt to bring the terms of "beauty" together with those of "motion," the multiple rhythms of modernity, temporality ("the preceding and the subsequent," in Bal&#x000E1;zs's phrase) and the mass or democratic art of the cinema.
</p>

<p>
This would seem to be of particular relevance now, when cultural theory is demonstrating not only a fascination with late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century models of time and space but also a desire to reclaim the category of beauty, for ethics as well as aesthetics. Isobel Armstrong's <i>The Radical Aesthetic, </i>for example,includes a chapter entitled "And Beauty? A Dialogue," in which she argues that, for Adorno, beauty is not a thing but "a <i>want, or wanting. </i>Beauty conjures wanting because it is a promise of the as yet unsayable, a fleeting promise of new possibilities, of scarcely envisioned openings in experience emancipated from the world of exchange."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Elaine 

<b></b>

Scarry's recent manifesto for beauty, entitled <i>On Beauty and Being Just</i>, argues that the desire for the replication of beauty sponsored not only the idea of eternity, "the perpetual duplicating of a moment that never stops," but also the "idea of terrestrial plenitude and distribution":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The first flash of the bird incites the desire to duplicate not only by translating the glimpsed image into a drawing or a poem or a photograph but simply by continuing to see her five seconds, twenty-five seconds, forty-five seconds later&#x02014;as long as the bird is there to be beheld . . . Pater tells us that Leonardo, as though half-crazed, used to follow people around the streets of Florence once he got "glimpses of it [beauty] in the strange eyes or hair of chance people." Sometimes he persisted until sundown. This replication in the realm of sensation can be carried out by a single perceiver across time . . . or can instead entail a brief act of perception distributed across many people.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The terms deployed by Armstrong and Scarry, as for others engaged in a recuperation of the concept of beauty, resonate strongly with those of early film criticism, and suggest that its interest for us might well ramify beyond its immediate historical context.

Critics who have discussed this aspect of Lindsay's work include Rachel O. Moore and Nick Browne. Moore's study, <i>Savage Theory: Cinema as Modern Magic</i> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000) looks at the "primitivism" inherent in Lindsay's film writings; Browne's article, "American Film Theory in the Silent Period: Orientalism as an Ideological Form," <i>Wide Angle</i> 11.4 (October 1989), notes the complexity of the "universal language" myth of cinema at a time of mass working-class immigration and a substantially immigrant and working-class audience for the cinema.

In all the mass of commentary on Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, two signal early essays, each by a key twentieth-century re, are rarely cited: John Cowper Powys's "James Joyce&#x02013;-An Appreciation," written immediately after the publication of the first edition, and Carl Jung's "<i>Ulysses</i>: A Monologue," written a decade after that epochal event of 1922. Neglecting these two essays, as scholars have done, has perpetuated a slight but significant distortion in our academic view of Joyce and the cultural shift his work has been taken to define. The distortion overlaps with a related misreading&#x02014;equally small but no less significant&#x02014;of T. S. Eliot's influential essay of 1923, "<i>Ulysses</i>, Order and Myth."
</p>

<p>
This would be a small matter indeed but for the astonishing claim of Eliot's essay: that <i>Ulysses</i> "is, I seriously believe, a step toward making the modern world possible for art."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  But are we sure we understand what Eliot meant by his claim? Equally pertinent, what do we think of it? Those questions get called to attention by the Powys and Jung essays. Returning to these three works, I want to open an argument for rethinking the history of twentieth-century fiction. To fully elaborate it, which is beyond the scope of this essay, would throw into prominence a number of writers: most notably, Powys himself and Laura Riding, who will re prominently here, but also Gertrude Stein, Dorothy Richardson, Aldous Huxley, Robert Graves, and Edward Upward&#x02014;whose positions in the history of the period remain underread to this day.

Briefly, Jung and Powys argue that Joyce's work should be read as subjective and intensely personal. When Jung identifies "Joyce's Ithaca" as a "new cosmic . . . detachment of consciousness, [a] depersonalization of the personality," we can easily mistake what he means to say.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Everything in <i>Ulysses</i> comes to us, in Jung's view, <i>sub specie somnium</i>, with the egos of all the characters&#x02014;their realist props and stays&#x02014;dissolved "as in a collective dream that begins nowhere and ends nowhere." "For that very reason," he goes on to observe, "all and everything, even the missing punctuation of the final chapter, is Joyce himself" (ibid). "His detached contemplative consciousness, dispassionately embracing in one glance the timeless simultaneity of the happenings of the sixteenth day of June, 1904, must say of all these appearances: <i>tat tvam asi</i>, 'That art thou'&#x02014;'thou' in a higher sense, not the ego but the self. For the self alone embraces the ego and the non-ego, the infernal regions, the viscera, the <i>imagines et lares</i>, and the heavens" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
Powys sees Joyce's work the same way. <i>Ulysses</i> "is <i>not</i>&#x02014;for all its realistic savagery&#x02014;an objective book at all. It is entirely subjective. It reveals only one soul in the world, the soul of James Joyce" ting for its life.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Commenting on a passage in "Circe," Powys thus says: "In a sense, in a very deep sense, the thing . . . is a world-maddened hoax of a deep imagination, turning and rending the plaster-cast mock-heroic attitudes of the 'cover-it-up' puppet show. It is James Joyce himself dancing a furious malice-dance on the dinner-table of the Best People while the ghost of King Edward (and all other reputable rulers of the world) 'levitate over heaps of slain, with white jujubes on their phosphorescent faces.'"<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  One of our best Powys scholars, Charles Lock, dismisses this way of reading <i>Ulysses</i> as "so wide of the mark that we can be confident that Powys had no knowledge of Joyce's personality."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  But Powys's reading, like Jung's, is not talking about personalities. Indeed, <i>Ulysses</i>, <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, even Dorothy Richardson's <i>Pilgrimage</i> are all, for Powys, defining works of the age because all, in their different fantastic subjectivities, broke with the mythologies of realism. The escape did not entail the disappearance or debunking of myth&#x02014;what Powys calls "life illusions"&#x02014;but the ability to take one's illusions seriously as they are: illusions, beliefs, ideologies.
</p>

<p>
Let us look again at Eliot's celebrated essay. Like Powys and Jung, Eliot explicitly sees in Joyce's book the end of "the novel" as a vital artistic form. (Not of course the end of prose fiction, but the end of the novel.) So he writes of Joyce's "mythic method" in <i>Ulysses</i> as the fateful "step" toward a cultural deliverance. The method involves drawing "a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Preserving that continuity&#x02014;dealing with culture's "dissociation of sensibility"&#x02014;is what Eliot, like his precursor Matthew Arnold, calls the mission of the classical ethos (or mythos). Unlike Arnold, however, Eliot marks out a signal difference between Joyce's mythic method and, say, Tennyson's or Swinburne's. Simply, Joyce's parallel is drawn arbitrarily. Eliot underscores this cardinal point with a pair of telling examples: "It is a method already adumbrated by Mr. Yeats" (ibid)&#x02014;Eliot must be thinking specifically of Yeats's <i>Per </i>

<b></b>

<i>Amica Silentia Lunae</i> &#x02014;and "It is a method for which the horoscope is auspicious" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
Notice the joke in that auspicious horoscope, which targets a central point in Eliot's essay. Einstein and science are referenced not in order to set scientific method as a model for what a modern artist should do. For Eliot, every possible method&#x02014;modern science, astrology, Yeats's quasi-mystical ideas that will culminate in the preposterous and suggestive <i>A Vision</i>, and now Joyce's "mythic method"&#x02014;constructs a human order for "the immense panorama" of human experience (ibid). The "futility and anarchy of contemporary history" can be so extreme, however, that art's ability "to see life steadily and see it whole," as Arnold put the matter, may appear imperiled. What "the mythic method" of <i>Ulysses</i> shows is that any mythology, religious or enlightened, may serve an artistic function. People used to believe in astrology and they now believe in science. Humans cannot live without beliefs and "life illusions." But neither can they live without an art capable of plucking, even from an anarchic culture, a form of order. The "method" of <i>Ulysses</i> argues, according to Eliot, that even the "futility and anarchy of contemporary history" (ibid) conceals unplumbed possibilities of order.
</p>

<p>
So "the horoscope is auspicious" because it can serve art as a form of order as much as quantum theory, the liturgical calendar, fractal geometry, number series like Fibonacci, the story of Odysseus or Tiresias. Deployed as catalytic agents, these impersonal devices could be transformed from ideologies or personal beliefs into "objective correlatives" of what Wordsworth called the "central peace subsisting at the heart of endless agitation."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
So far as an ordering mechanism for art is concerned, then, Eliot might well have said that "In my father's house are many mansions." For Eliot, however, "many" but not just <i>any</i> mansions. Certain forms of order seemed intolerable&#x02014;for example, the highly idiosyncratic procedures of Gertrude Stein, which repelled him: "her work is not improving, it is not amusing, it is not interesting, it is not good for one's mind. But its rhythms have a peculiar hypnotic power not met with before. It has a kinship with the saxophone. If this is of the future, then the future is, as it very likely is, of the barbarians. But this is the future in which we ought not to be interested.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  But given Eliot's argument in his Joyce essay, why would he draw this line? Why would Yeats's <i>A Vision</i> or, later, Graves's <i>The White Goddess</i> positively attract him but not <i>Geography and Plays</i> , <i>The Making of Americans</i> , and <i>Composition as Explanation</i> ? Eliot's difficulty seems to lie with Stein's commitment to an endless and self-renewing innocence. The essay "Charleston, Hey! Hey!" is a review of John Rodker's <i>The Future of Futurism</i>, and Eliot clearly locates Stein in that movement. Stein is no Futurist, of course, but her various procedures for writing in and as a continuing present have Futurist analogues, as Marjorie Perloff has shown.
</p>

<p>
Eliot's "mythic method," it appears, is limited by its neo-classicist ethos. The writer&#x02014;the "individual talent"&#x02014;is free to make an arbitrary choice of ordering forms so long as the forms are drawn from "tradition," even if the traditions are fairly recent ones, like the tradition of modern science. The individual talent and his artistic work function, as he argued, as a catalytic agent&#x02014;important not so much in himself or itself 

<b></b>

but rather as a vehicle or device: in this case, as an agent bringing a form of order to an immense panorama of futility. For a writer like Eliot, Stein's work does not bring order to that panorama, it exhibits the panorama. Stein's texts occupy what she called a "continuing present," extruding themselves out of themselves. The focus in Stein is not on some conceptual or thematic result of the writing but on the act of writing itself, and hence&#x02014;as Jung and Powys remark of Joyce&#x02014;on the individual, the self, as a writing agent. If the text represents an "objective correlative," its correlative for Stein would be the text itself as it generates itself. The Stein text would be what Roy Wagner has called "a symbol that stands for itself."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Powys and Jung thus read Joyce black where Eliot reads him white. For them, the order that <i>Ulysses</i> sets in play is not Eliot's formal or structural order, it is rhetorical. When Powys and Jung read Joyce they emphasize the book's subjectivity, reading the writing as a kind of monodrama. In this respect the precursors of <i>Ulysses</i> would be Byron's <i>Manfred</i>, almost any of Poe's stories, Tennyson's <i>Maud</i>. The writing is a play being staged by Joyce in which (or so that) readers can discover their parts. The analogue with Brecht seems clear. The novelty of <i>Ulysses</i> is how it exposes the work of fiction not as a text or a document but as a field of discourse where readers are assumed to be present: the reader being a "hero" of the writing, as Bakhtin would say. An adequate response to the book is thus emblematized in Jung's "Monologue" or Powys's nakedly personal reading. In this view, Eliot's reading would itself be seen as completely idiosyncratic, the rhetorical performance of a neo-classicist trying to keep his feet and point of balance, like Dr. Johnson in another, equally volatile age.

<p class="noIndent">
Two writers less alike than Laura Riding and John Cowper Powys are hardly imaginable. Riding's work&#x02014;poetry as well as prose, fiction and non-fiction&#x02014;is so obsessed with ideas of clarity and precision of thought that the writing often takes weird, quirky turns into a kind of private language. Powys's writing, by contrast, is loose and flagrant, a lavish rhetorical style that glories in a Romantic inheritance stretching back through Scott to Sterne, Browne, and Rabelais.
</p>

<p>
In each case the stance and procedure are taken with great deliberateness. Riding writes under the banner of a fierce intellectual commitment to what she called truth-telling. Powys, on the other hand, is willfully irregular, glorying in the follies and contradictions of his work and embracing as a badge of honor the names his enemies call him, like literary "buffoon" and "charlatan." As he remarks toward the end of his <i>Autobiography</i>, his work is bound to "a quite definite philosophy of life," pledging allegiance to Blake's famous proverb "The road of Excess leads to the Palace of Wisdom."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
More important than this shared willfulness, however, is a shared vision of their work as an antithesis of high modernism, an effort to escape or dismantle the art that made high modernism and its world possible.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Let me begin with Riding, whose position on these matters is better known. Between 1928 and 1938 she laid out a critical analysis of modernism that would culminate years later in <i>The Telling</i> . Her focus is on "poetry" as the emblematic form of a cultural "professionalism" pledged to an ideal of perfect expression (<i>le mot juste</i>). In this commitment to virtuosity and "poetic success in words," "failure is scared away" (<i>T</i>, 66) from the act of writing. This is a fundamental mistake, evading what is most human about the way we use language&#x02014;that is to say, in "the common risks of language, where failure stalks in every word" (ibid). Facing and dealing with that risk in our shared human intercourse is Riding's chief object.
</p>

<p>
The critique of modernism via a critique of a mistaken idea about poetry involves installing a rhetorical view of language in place of the prevalent structural or formal views. Riding's "Preface" to her 1982 edition of <i>Progress of Stories</i> is very clear. Modernist ideas (like those in Eliot's essay on <i>Ulysses</i>) view imaginative writing as an art, and pre-eminently an art of making&#x02014;"Make it new," "il miglior fabbro." Her different view is that writing should be what she came to call "a telling." "The initiating impulses from which [my] stories issued were not impulses of <i>art,</i> not impulses to construct stories but to <i>tell</i> stories."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This move means to escape "the ineradicable fault of the wisdom-professions," all of which set up a division between a priesthood and a laity, the one knowing and articulate, the other "silent" (<i>T,</i> 65). In a rhetorical condition of that kind, "the silent laity is <i>given</i> its universal speech" (ibid). For Riding, however, everyone&#x02014;writers as well as readers&#x02014;shares the obligation to build up "the one story that tells all there is to tell," the story "kept," as she says, "in companionship" (<i>T</i>, 176). For Riding or any individual talent, then, one speaks/writes out of a subjectivity conscious of its risk of failure, on one hand, and on the other of its obligation to "the dignity of truth-telling" (ibid).

I testify that my story of there being essentially and ultimately but one story is my utter own. Let it not be equated with anything else! This would compromise its worth as an offering to that possibility of companionship&#x02014;to the prospect . . . of its being a story of a one story we have all to tell. Whatever distance remains . . . let it be true distance, distance between ourselves, in their thought as theirs and myself in my thought as mine. This being so, nothing is lost, I think, should our approaches seem to come to nought: fate, I think, is honorable with us in the true difficulties, allowing us rebeginnings where they halt us.

<p>
In Riding, this anti-aesthetic culminates in what Harry Mathews called Queen Story. The category includes far more than the explicit stories in <i>Progress of Stories</i>, or the long fictions like <i>Lives of Wives</i>. <i>The Telling</i> is itself a story in Riding's sense, a fact that she makes very clear as early as <i>Anarchism is not enough</i> . In vehicular appearance a collection of separate essays, <i>Anarchism</i> turns that formal apparatus into an unfolding intellectual autobiography staged <i>in medias res</i>. The organization is not at first apparent because the story it tells is not structured chronologically. The organization is <i>literal</i>, very much in a Steinian mode&#x02014;a fact that becomes clear when one reads the book seriatim. <i>Anarchism</i> tells the story of its own writing. It has much

in common with Dante's <i>La Vita Nuova</i>, on one hand, and with Edward Upward's <i>The Spiral Ascent</i> (1961-1977). (Upward's neglected <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> is an all but explicit reprisal of Dante's autobiography.)

<p class="noIndent">
Writing to his brother as he nears the completion of his masterpiece <i>A Glastonbury Romance</i>, Powys stakes out his own anti-aesthetic: "I am anyway no artist; but rather a Stonehenge Bard of Interminable Prose-Narrative [who] relegates Art to the minor place in his life."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  This theme of "How little of an <i>artist</i> I am" runs through all his letters and the <i>Autobiography</i>, the latter being nothing more (or less) than a long <i>apologia pro vita sua</i>.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"To the devil with 'art'!" he writes. But what kind of writing is possible when, very much like Riding, Powys dismisses "duty to art" as mere "aesthetic tyranny" (<i>A</i>, 539, 641)? The question is less insistent in Riding's case because her work parades its care and deliberateness. Her attack on false aesthetic pretenses comes only to uphold what she calls "the dignity of truth" against the false promise of aesthetic perfection. But for Powys, dignity of every kind stands like a dragon in the gate. Powys therefore develops his theory of the artist as fool, mountebank, charlatan, zany. "A ninny I fancy is a person who feels and looks like an undignified fool, while a zany is one who carries this peculiar cult into <i>behavior</i> and even makes an art of it. Cannot you see that there is a deep and subtle <i>irony</i> in all this, and a perfect awareness of how it strikes the 'daughters of Saul,' when I gird my loins and dance before the Ark, like David or Dan Leno . . . . None of your controversial Archdeacons would dare to give themselves away to this tune" (<i>A</i>, 538). The "art" is a knowing comedy, "deep and subtle" because the comedian puts himself at center stage, his own performance&#x02014;lecturing, writing&#x02014;being the measure of what Powys called, invoking his favorite Nietzschean idea, the "Human, All Too Human."
</p>

<p>
For Powys, "This ninny-ism of mine . . . protests against the shallow rationalism of the hour . . . in defense of the inexplicable" (<i>A</i>, 539). And so he turns to his beloved brother Llewelyn and asks if this shameless "liberty" "to feel what I like to feel and express it as best I can" is permissible "in your pagan kingdom"? "<i>Not</i> allowed! Very well. Where then does your kingdom differ from this kingdom of this world? In being more beautiful, you say. So be it. Yours is an aesthetic tyranny, theirs a moral one; but the sweet bitch, 'Fay que ce Vouldray'&#x02014;if I get the old Rabelaisian French correctly&#x02014;must to kennel under both your whips" (<i>A</i>, 539). Parodying Jesus's famous remark "My kingdom is not of this world," Powys issues his "plague on both your houses." It is a secular&#x02014;what he would call a "polytheistic"&#x02014;parody.
</p>

<p>
Powys's touchstone for this charlatan's art is Rabelais, where "the inexplicable" unfolds through every feature and scale of Rabelais's writing: the free discursive style, the astonishing <i>parole en libert&#x000E9;</i>, the narrative episodes licensed to extravagance. But this literary reference, though useful, exposes less about Powys's writing than the key event of his <i>Autobiography</i>: Chapter ten, "America," where Powys recalls his road-show 

<b></b>

lecturing adventures under the stage management (these are all Powys's framing terms) of G. Arnold Shaw. Powys tells the story as a kind of magical event brought about by "the intervention of the gods" (<i>A</i>, 440). "I was the clown of our circus, and Arnold was the ringmaster . . . . How roguishly he would crack his whip when his poor Cagliostro was dispatched on a tour across half the Continent!" (<i>A</i>, 447).
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the lectures, both men understood, was not cultural uplift but "public entertainment": "We were both more than a little anti-human, more than a little malicious to the solemnities and respectabilities of the academic and even of the pseudo-academic world . . . . Even more than moral pomposity we disliked a certain type of patronizing intellectualism. Our grand advertising always was: 'If our circus is not <i>enthralling</i>&#x02014;to the Devil with it!'" (<i>A</i>, 448). "Malice" is a code word for Powys, recurring everywhere. Detecting the "malice" in <i>Ulysses</i>, Powys reads the "Circe" episode as a comic satire on the hypocrite illusions of "the Best People." In the case of his own writing, Powys cultivates a kind of shamelessness so that the comic inflection will be registered by the audience. But this Powysian greeting is double-edged, as liable to disturb as it is to disarm. So of his lecturing circus Powys observes that "it was not very long before the eccentricities in our show began to have very disconcerting effects." Persons "preoccupied with the idea of helping the cultural interests of the community"&#x02014;"the type who organized our various provincial lectures"&#x02014;would often grow suspicious and unhappy at "the humorous detachment with which this mountebank and his manager regarded the whole business of lecturing . . ., my inspired 'grotesqueries' and my wild prophetic incantations." The reaction of the audience, on the other hand, was only increased enthusiasm, "with the people . . . turn[ing] up in their biggest crowds just after the worst kind of misunderstanding" with the local organizers. "I indulged in constant violences to good taste. I yielded to outbursts of intoxicated malice and infernal spleen. I worked myself up into such ecstasies of anger against the whole well-constituted and well-ordered half of society, that I babbled, burbled, bubbled, blurted my very soul out. . . . I was as one possessed" (<i>A</i>, 449).
</p>

<p>
The event became for Powys "<i>a great new art</i>," a deliberated contrivance staged for the ludic deliverance of both artist and artist's audience from the "aesthetic tyranny" of Baudelaire's <i>hypocrite lecteur</i>, still regnant in the rules of culture:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
By getting rid of all "highbrow solemnity" . . .under the Rabelaisian encouragement of my unique circus-manager, I succeeded in eventually <i>hollowing myself out</i>, like an elder-stalk with the sap removed, so that my whole personality, every least movement I made, and every least sound I made, and every flicker, wrinkle, and quiver of my face, became expressive of the particular subject I was interpreting . . . . [and] the fact that both Arnold and I had the same schoolboy contempt for every sort of pretentiousness made me in the end a sort of deboshed John the Baptist . . . the kind of Jokanaan that a Salome might really have loved before she cut off his head.

The passage exhibits its own argument. Powys's subjective reading of <i>Ulysses</i> joins hands with this ludic reading of Wilde's <i>Salome</i>, which is a kind of gloss on Beardsley's graphical reading, where Wilde's impish and comical play received its first exposure. 

<b></b>

Because most artists, even Wilde, hesitate to debosh their own work, they necessarily reinstall an ideal&#x02014;or a tyranny&#x02014;of the aesthetic. This last aesthetic resort is precisely what Powys wants to overcome. He seeks a form of writing where failure stalks in every word.

<p class="noIndent">
In Powys's view, Joyce himself would cultivate that resort all too often in both of his masterpieces. That limitation in Joyce would lead Powys to write his sympathetic critique of <i>Finnegans Wake</i> and to attempt what he saw as the "rewriting" of Joyce's last book in Powys's wartime romance <i>Porius</i>, which he regarded as his masterwork.
</p>

<p>
Powys's intentions are on full display in his extended appreciation of Dorothy Richardson's "absolutely unique . . . method" of fiction writing.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  We want to examine closely his reading of Richardson because it explains his own programmatic writing goals much more fully. As with his essay on <i>Ulysses</i>, the very peculiarity of Powys's reading defines its importance.
</p>

<p>
Once again Powys introduces us to an anti-aesthete. Like Laura Riding, Powys genders this anti-aesthetic female, an important move in Powys's argument. More than Joyce, Richardson is Powys's "Grand Heretic of Fiction" because she displaces "the art of <i>the novel</i>" with "the old story-telling of the famous 'fabulators' of early times" (<i>DR</i>, 38). Richardson's writing does not build up or reveal an ordering structure, it is rather an "evasive" art, moving "incidentally and as it were sideways" (<i>DR</i>, 26, 25). "The only unity given to this chaos of impressions is the identity of the consciousness that welcomes them," so that "the only end of the pilgrimage of Miriam that one can contemplate with equanimity is Miriam's own death" (<i>DR</i>, 36). Richardson's "stoic heathen way" turns the idea of death into an aesthetic talisman that, as another humane atheist famously observed, "redeems from decay the visitations of the divinity in man."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
So in "the worst of [her] miseries" and humiliations, Richardson's Miriam "became aware of a curious buoyancy rising within her." "It was so strange that she stood still for a moment on the stair. For a second, life seemed to cease in her, and the staircase to be swept from under her feet. . . . 'I'm alive' . . . 'It's me, <i>me</i>; this is <i>me</i> being alive,' she murmured with a feeling under her like the sudden drop of a lift."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Reflecting on her sensation Miriam wonders "What's the use of feeling like that if it doesn't stay?" The thought immediately brings its anti-thought: "It doesn't change anything. Next time I'll make it stay." What will remain is not the specific physical sensation but a commitment of consciousness to attend carefully upon such moments: "It might whisk me right away. There's something in me that can't be touched or altered. Me. If it comes again. If it's stronger every time . . . . Perhaps it goes on getting stronger till you die."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
It's important to realize that this climactic event comes at the end of chapter three of a book extending to nine chapters, and of course that the book, <i>Backwater</i>, is only the second of the ten volumes that comprise <i>Pilgrimage</i>. The passage strikes deeply because it is so anticlimactic, because the reader understands what the writing is 

<b></b>

confident about: that these events <i>will</i> go on like this to the end, "getting stronger" in their resolutely "sideways" and incidental intensities.
</p>

<p>
Aware that many readers find Richardson's work "dull" and "appallingly tedious" (<i>DR</i>, 43, 33), Powys argues what Riding argues. The charge of dullness locates a set of cultural conventions, gendered male, that overstress "the artist's and poet's craving for shape, for form, for a definite issue, for a desired consummation" (<i>DR</i>, 31). "Think . . . of the emotional <i>purpose</i> of Hardy, of the <i>romantic</i> purpose of Conrad, of the psycho-aesthetic <i>purpose</i> of Henry James." There you have what Riding saw as the kingdom of story, waiting its redemption by the Queen and "Queen Story." Powys thinks much the same. "All these diffused underlying 'purposes' give unity, glamour, interest to their books. Proust himself, with his grand cult of the creative and destructive processes of time, has his ultimate intention, the rounding off of the whole dramatic 'scenario.' Dorothy Richardson . . . has no such 'purpose'" (<i>DR</i>, 35-6). She has instead her "astonishing "verisimilitude'" (<i>DR</i>, 45). Powys sets the word in quotation marks because her "realistic artfulness" is for him the furthest thing imaginable from the received traditions of realist fiction. It is "a more lyrical, a more subjective" realist style (<i>DR</i>, 38). Richardson's "verisimilitude" admits no "slurring over [of any] aspect, however trivial, however disgusting, however recalcitrant of the truth about the way things drift and flutter and peter out" (<i>DR</i>, 31). To some, that kind of writing will seem dull. Not to Powys. "It is just these unweeded, unraked-over lumps of raw sod, that give to her magical wild-flowers their overpowering fragrance. Certainly she is one of the master-realists of our tongue; and if there were not so many passages that the frivolous would call 'dull' this realism would work its gradual, its insidious, its saturating spell on our minds'" (<i>DR</i>, 45).
</p>

<p>
Anyone who has read <i>Pilgrimage</i> would call that description far more lyrical and subjective than anything in Richardson's realist prose. What Powys writes here (and throughout his essay) is at least as pertinent to Powys's writing as to hers. Choose any passage you like&#x02014;for instance, this from the opening chapter of <i>A Glastonbury Romance</i> when John Crow is "approach[ing] the home of his dead mother."
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Why, thinking of his mother, he felt so sad, was a strange fact beyond this man's analysis.

<p>
Let me give a brief explication of what's going on here. John Crow is a man unusually attentive to the earth and her inhuman creatures. Just now, on his way to his father's funeral and a reading of his father's will, he is distracted by thoughts of his dead mother. The Earth Mother's sudden "realistic" appearance triggers the anti-climax that is a staple of Powys's writing. John's inexplicable sadness emerges not because of his recently dead father, not even because of his long-dead mother, now recalled. He grows sad, rather,

because he registers, unbeknownst to himself, the displeasure of the Earth Mother. All the "thoughts" in this passage&#x02014;the minute physical descriptions&#x02014;are the Earth Mother's for her children. But just now those thoughts are crossed with jealousy because her dearest devotee is precisely <i>un</i>aware of her and her frail vegetable children. John Crow is sad because she is sad, and she is sad and jealous and hurt because John has let human memories distract him from the present living world around him.
</p>

<p>
But now recall that initial sentence: "Why, thinking of his mother, he felt so sad, was a strange fact beyond this man's analysis." The word "analysis" signals the reader toward the psychoanalytic reading that this situation fairly begs for. That interpretive line is invoked, however, only to be explicitly set aside and replaced by Powys's strange and comic mode of magical realism. Of <i>course</i> John Crow rarely remembers his mother, and cares little <i>to</i> remember her. Both his mother and his father have long been displaced from John's affective life. So his devotion to the Earth Mother is a fantasy, a sublimation, and Powys wants the reader to see that. But once having seen it, Powys wants to make sure we don't find it nearly so interesting&#x02014;or so human&#x02014;as the magically real Earth Mother and her upsurge of emotional pique at her favorite, John Crow; or rather, not nearly so interesting as the Powysian mode of writing that makes this kind of commitment to the "inexplicable."
</p>

<p>
To explicate in this way reveals, I hope, the absurdity of the Powysian text. The prose is at once comic and touching because its folly is an essential part of the game. The passage unfolds a subjective correlative for a sensibility willing and able to imagine and write like this in 1932. The thoughts and feelings of the Earth Mother index the commitment of a writer astonishingly, not to say wondrously, out of tune with his time.
</p>

<p>
The passage shows why the notorious opening paragraph of <i>A Glastonbury Romance</i> is a stylistic caper cut before the ark of art, danced in "perfect awareness of how it strikes the 'daughters of Saul.'"

At the striking of noon on a certain fifth of March, there occurred within a causal radius of Brandon railway-station and yet beyond the deepest pools of emptiness between the uttermost stellar systems one of those infinitesimal ripples in the creative silence of the First Cause which always occur when an exceptional stir of heightened consciousness agitates any living organism in this astronomical universe. Something passed at that moment, a wave, a motion, a vibration, too tenuous to be called magnetic, too subliminal to be called spiritual, between the soul of a particular human being who was emerging from a third-class carriage of the twelve-nineteen train from London and the divine-diabolic soul of the First Cause of all life.

There we have Powysian malice&#x02014;it is ultimately as good-natured as Sterne or Goldsmith&#x02014;on full display. Powys makes his brazen start with a kind of barbaric yawp telling the reader, at the very outset, that this is how things will be for another twelve hundred pages. The passage is fully deboshed prose, all the sweeter and more resonant for its flagrant and derelict parody of its immediate master, Thomas Hardy. Writing so, as Timothy Hyman observes, "The Powys novel commits suicide," but only, as Hyman rightly goes on to say, "to gain more life."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
As with <i>Ulysses</i>, much more is involved in these kinds of Powysian texts than an arresting passage of style. If we assume a Brechtian stance, which is what Powys does with Joyce and Richardson, the "author's" subjective agency is both indexed by the writing and folded into the writing. The "author" that survives this process will not be set apart, like a god paring his fingernails. The author will find (or lose) himself in his own work, dissolved throughout. Not at all what we professors have learned to call an "unreliable narrator," but rather an omniscient, deboshed one. When Powys says of himself that his writer's function is more Mediumistic than Authoritative, this is what he is describing.

Here is how Powys describes his writing procedures to his friend Louis Wilkinson. The comment comes in a letter written as Powys was in the midst of the composition of what he considered his masterwork, <i>Porius</i>. Noticing that his letter has begun to digress, he pauses to comment:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
You see, my dear, <i>all</i> (without any exception) of the talent, gift, eloquence, insight clairvoyance I possess is always <i>digression</i> . . . . But of course I do painfully, laboriously, lengthily build up (I speak of both my tracts <i>and</i> my long romances) a sort of foundation, and on top of that a sort of scaffolding, <i>both very simple</i>&#x02014;including all the Main Characters &amp; where they live, or all the main theses, propositions &amp; contentions &amp; here they end! <i>Then</i> I let <i>the chance moment</i> have its way&#x02014;have its ways with the characters, have its way with the ideas! In both cases I am absolutely irresponsible &amp; unscrupulous &amp;, at the best, Mediumistic, and at the worst <i>both</i> silly and dull!

Digression in Powys signals chance intervention, which he courts by eliminating plot from the elements gathered for the initial "foundation" and "scaffolding" of his work. His writing begins with an array of characters, a socio-geographical location, and a set of ideas, and these materials unfold as Powys writes himself into that set of materials, letting them appear to dictate what they might involve. They unfold as "a host of incidents and exciting situations and intricate disquisitions on the psychology of these entangled persons." The "Coincidents . . . help me with surprises," Powys tells Wilkinson (<i>LLW</i>, 371). "Plot" therefore emerges but only as "incidents" in a networks of <i>co</i>incidents, all parts of the storytelling more or less localized, all subordinated to the vast set of unpredictable possibilities latent in the materials and awaiting discovery through the ceaseless act of writing itself. One recalls Byron's famous description of the "plan" of <i>Don Juan</i>: "I have no plan, I had no plan&#x02014;but I had or have materials" (letter to John Murray, 12 August 1819).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Most important in such a writing schema are the creatures Powys is shameless to "marshall": "all sorts of invisible powers and forces" (<i>LLW</i>, 371). Making the double-natured First Cause or the Earth Mother active agents in the story-telling is the least of the matter. In his late fiction <i>Atlantis</i>, the club of Hercules, a moth, a fly, and certain pillars in the entrance hall to the palace of Odysseus are attentive and voluble 

<b></b>

characters&#x02014;but not all the pillars, some are quite dull. When human tears fall to the ground in his early novel <i>Wood and Stone</i> (chapter thirteen), "Two wandering ants," happening by, pause in their work to investigate this strange event&#x02014;strange because these are "Big salt tears," a type completely beyond the experience of these particular ants, who live far inland.
</p>

<p>
Or recall the end of the first chapter of <i>A Glastonbury Romance</i>. After the will is read, the people depart and the house is left "silent and alone" (<i>GR</i>, 47). But not entirely alone. Escaped from its realistic human enslavement, "the now-darkened conservatory listened to the placid sub-human breathings of heliotrope and lemon verbena." And these vegetable creatures? The conservatory can now hear&#x02014;<i>we</i> can hear&#x02014;"the faint catch in the drowsy susurration" of the lemon verbena, "one of [whose] twigs was bleeding a little from the impact of the fingers of the indignant Mr. Didlington." The text is expelling the Porlockian world of lawyers like Mr. Didlington, who presided at the reading of the will earlier in the chapter. As that world fades away, a magical, unobserved world is rising to view. "Silent and alone the broad staircase fell into that trance of romantic melancholy which was its invariable mood when the hall lamp was first lit. The oil paintings upon its walls looked out from their gilt frames with that peculiar expression of indrawn expectancy&#x02014;self-centered and yet patiently waiting&#x02014;of which human passers-by catch only the psychic echo or shadow or after-taste, for a single flicker of a second, as if they caught them off guard" (<i>GR</i>, 47-8).
</p>

<p>
The "coincidents" emerging through that passage liberate the prose completely. "Of all these rooms the one that now fell into the most intense attitude of strained expectancy was the drawing room." The room is expectant because its space is being transacted by words "emanat[ing] from a pale insubstantial husk upon the air." A dialogue of the dead between John Crow's father and mother is passing through the space of the drawing room, but while the room (so to say) has the experience of this bizarre exchange, it will, like ourselves, miss the meaning. So the prose, now a full participant in the book Powys has set in motion, resorts to a series of comparisons that index the room's "strained expectancy." The insubstantial words were like "the cast-off skin of a snake, or the yet more fragile skin of a newt," they were like "the creakings of chairs after people have left a room for hours," "like the murmurs of forgotten worm-eaten boards," and so forth. All descriptions fail, for indeed, who could ever explain what lay beneath the two bitter sentences recorded in the text. "You ought to have been older than all your brothers, woman, instead of younger," the dead man says to his dead wife, and she replies: "A cruel coward is what you are, William Crow, and what you've always been; but if ever, when I am dead, you leave your money to anyone but Philip's son I will punish you with a punishment <i>worse than God's</i>!" (<i>GR</i>, 48).
</p>

<p>
This conversation&#x02014;at once dreadful and ridiculous&#x02014;helps to explain John Crow's devotion to the Earth Mother and his indifference to his human parents. But that isn't its chief function. Since the evil case feared by John's dead mother has in fact transpired, as we learned in the Porlockian world when his father's will was read, what <i>now</i>? What can she mean? Or perhaps the question is: when did she say this? Or: when <i>is</i> she saying it, and when is this strange dialogue taking place (if the question can even 

<b></b>

be posed)? The chapter draws to its end leaving readers, at least formally, in that state of "suspense" familiar to everyone who has learned to read fiction organized by rules of plot and by those Victorian material circumstances&#x02014;like serial publication&#x02014;that fostered the devices of plot. But John Crow's mother's threat hurled against her dead husband is preposterous in any view we might realistically imagine. The reader is thus placed in a situation utterly, ludicrously, beyond the rules of plot suspense. This is truly a novel committing suicide, and exactly in order to gain more life.
</p>

<p>
Again and again Powys says that this kind of story-telling is all he really cares about: "I adore the sensation of a story; of <i>anybody</i>'s story&#x02014;of story for its own sake [and] especially the sensation of telling oneself a story, and in the story I become any one of all the characters, male or female" (<i>LLW</i>, 296). Or again: "I tell myself stories then and just ramble on, losing myself &amp; my &#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; personality in those I'm writing about" (<i>LLW</i>, 195). Powys is famous, notorious, for declaring how he covets his "sensations." When that temperament gets harnessed to making prose fictions, "story for its own sake" and&#x02014;even more crucially&#x02014;"the sensation of telling oneself a story" become the subject of the writing. His fictions are all staged performances of the act of writing. Powysian story-telling is something "for me to play at" (<i>LLW</i>, 296) in an unfolding process of invention and discovery. Starting from a condition of intense subjectivity, the writer-as-artist gets engulfed in his own writing, which then takes on a life of its own.

Taking adequate account of imaginative writing in the twentieth century begs us to retrace our steps and look down some of the roads not taken by our installed academic traditions of literary history. In Gail McDonald's shrewd 1993 account, we have "learned to be modern," or to read the works of modernism, in certain highly restricted ways. Her view has been echoed and mirrored in many academic studies since that time, as it was prered in the work of a few critics like George Steiner and Marjorie Perloff.
</p>

<p>
Most of these critics locate their arguments in relation to the traditions of poetry&#x02014;with good reason, since the issue of "poetry" lies at the heart of the arguments about culture as they were fashioned under the modernist horizon. Those critics who investigate modernism in relation to fiction usually take little account of the writers who ought to command our greatest attention: Powys and Riding, of course, but also Richardson, Flann O'Brien, Edward Upward, Robert Graves. The late work of both Vernon Lee&#x02014;<i>Satan the Waster</i>  in particular&#x02014;and of Aldous Huxley (<i>Eyeless in Gaza</i>, 1936) might as well have served the general purposes of my argument here, as would a close study of the career of Edward Upward, with special attention to his monumental <i>The Spiral Ascent</i> and some of his late stories, like "The Scenic Railway." An essay devoted entirely to the "auspicious" formalities of <i>The White Goddess</i> would be just as useful and illuminating.
</p>

<p>
The work of writers operating beyond the tight little island of our Anglophone culture has been for some time our major resource for thinking (and writing) outside the box of that powerful, not to say <i>hegemonic</i>, cultural tradition. Most important here has 

<b></b>

been OuLiPo, whose practices gained wide dispersal <i>except</i> in England and the United States. Harry Mathews's work has reigned in its lone splendor for decades. As for contemporary English-language writing, by which I mean writing since the Vietnam War, we observe many practices that range beyond the conventions, even the <i>avant-garde</i> conventions, of traditional modernism. Negotiating those practices is difficult without an ordinance survey map of modernism that is far more detailed and comprehensive than the ones we now possess.
</p>

<p>
Such a map will be drawn when we undertake new field work and incorporate our findings into global measurements. This work needs to recover not only the lost ground of the modernist period, however. Equally important is a return to the period of the late Victorians, particularly the period from 1848 when the divide that opened between Clough and Arnold set an example of many roads that would be taken and not taken thereafter. Much the same could be said and shown by investigating the emergence of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, which ushered in epochal changes in aesthetic practices that set the foundation for modernism itself, when the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and its immediate inheritors were publicly repudiated.
</p>

<p>
Recently scholars have begun to look again at this cultural liaison, once seen as a great divide. The re-examination has been largely confined to poetry, however. In this connection, let me close by naming George Meredith. The remarkable innovation of his verse, not least the sonnet-sequence <i>Modern Love</i>, is now widely recognized and accounted for. The so-called "nature" poetry remains behindhand, as does the closely related "nature" poetry of Meredith's friend Swinburne. Even more unfortunate, perhaps, Meredith's prose fiction has largely slipped from view. In this case, what we lose is the example of a radical shift in the resources of prose fiction, especially at the level of pure style. The shift is perceptible as well in Swinburne's prose, also forgotten except in a brief late <i>amende</i> by Edmund Wilson.
</p>

<p>
What happened to English prose fiction in the twentieth century? We can't hope to answer that question adequately unless we get beyond those commonplace formulations we have raised up through critical ideas drawn from the work of Flaubert and James. As a man once said of Wordsworth, this will no longer <i>do</i>.

<i>White Christmas</i> (Michael Curtiz, USA, 1954) is usually known as just another contributor to the white noise of the holiday season. An ineluctable feature of the holiday landscape, its excessive visibility has rendered it invisible to criticism. The film has not been the subject of any serious scholarship&#x02014;either on the genre of the musical or on Michael Curtiz, its director. In the three major monographs on Curtiz, <i>White Christmas</i> only merits a single paragraph in the most recent by James Robertson, who dismisses the film as "a glossy Vistavision [sic] reworking of Mark Sandrich's 1942 <i>Holiday Inn</i> . . . "<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  True, <i>White Christmas</i> was the director's 167th film and has to be situated within an oeuvre that includes <i>Casablanca</i> (1942, USA), <i>Mildred Pierce</i> (1945, USA) and <i>Yankee Doodle Dandy</i> (1942, USA). Yet the slighting of <i>White Christmas</i> by later historians and critics seems odd for a number of reasons. Most importantly, the film was not just another "glossy Vistavision reworking" of another holiday classic. It was actually the <i>first</i> VistaVision [note uppercase V] film to be produced by Paramount Studios. It was also extraordinarily successful: it was the highest grossing film of 1954, the year it was released, making some twelve million dollars, and it has continued to be a money-spinner ever since. Yet despite its industrial specificity and its ubiquity, the film has not red importantly in recent scholarship on widescreen production and exhibition practices.
</p>

<p>
Of course, not every film&#x02014;not even one that enjoyed spectacular financial success&#x02014;deserves serious exegesis. But <i>White Christmas</i>'s status as the first VistaVision film ever made gives it an emblematic place in film history at a critical moment, the period when the studio system was being redefined and Hollywood 

<b></b>

was battling to gain back viewers lost to television and other leisurely post-war pursuits. <i>White Christmas</i> compels our attention because it so manifestly visualizes and materializes the historical conditions under which it was produced. Like most backstage musicals, <i>White Christmas</i> exhibits a requisite, almost knee-jerk reflexivity. But that reflexivity is impressive both because it constitutes a self-consciousness about the film's generic conventions, and because it broods on the film's conditions of industrial manufacture and consumption, in this film's case the VistaVision mode of production and exhibition.
</p>

<p>
Jane Feuer has argued that the reflexivity typical of the Hollywood musical serves primarily to bolster the genre's legitimacy and ensure its viability. With the studio system's decline, such reflexivity underwent a process of mutation. What Feuer calls "late genre" films produced in the "late" or "post studio" era (from the late 1940s onward) tend toward "critical reflexivity," a mode in which the films "systematically deconstruct those very elements that give the genre its regularity."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  These "critically reflexive" musicals, Feuer claims, are "modernist" (though she offers the term in quotation marks).
</p>

<p>
To illustrate her notion of this new, modernist form of reflexivity, Feuer uses the George Cukor film <i>A Star Is Born</i>, released in 1954, the same year as <i>White Christmas</i>. She dwells on the long scene in which Judy Garland's character Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester rehearses a musical number from her new film before her husband Norman Maine (played by James Mason) in the comfort of the living room of their Malibu pleasure dome. In between breathlessly performing the song, Garland signals the scenic shifts that will occur in the finished film: "Now I'm at the top of the Eiffel Tower! . . . Now I'm in China!" The scene is a raucous and sustained parody of the musical convention in which song and dance numbers are bodied forth spontaneously and fantastically. Garland's number, says Feuer, "systematically debunks the principle of the spontaneous generation of performance in musicals."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
<i>White Christmas</i> is not a debunking, deconstructive musical. Nor is it interested in demystifying the myth of spontaneous entertainment or questioning whether the musical was, in 1954, a viable genre. Quite the opposite, in fact: <i>White Christmas</i> nostalgically seeks to return its spectators to a rapt belief in the entertainments offered by the Hollywood musical. More importantly, the film also bears the burden of demonstrating its new technology, the VistaVision widescreen; its staging of its technological and historical significance and specificity takes place through the set design and the way that its actors are made to interact with its sets, especially in several of the film's spectacular dance numbers. No, <i>White Christmas</i> is not a modernist film; but it is a film preoccupied by modernism. Consider one of its central numbers, entitled "Choreography": dancers performing movements that are clearly meant to parody the work of Martha Graham are danced into submission by explosive tap dancing performed by Vera-Ellen. "Choreography," in which modernism is presented as a threat to the entertainment offered by the Hollywood musical, is not just another clich&#x000E9;d restaging of the quarrel between high art and mass art. It suggests a heuristic approach for studying the status of modernism in Hollywood, at a moment when significant examples of Hollywood 

<b></b>

genre filmmaking were operating explicitly, in Feuer's understanding and mine, within a mode of modernism. <i>White Christmas</i>'s VistaVision cinematography, I shall argue, red a technologically progressive but ideologically conservative attempt to retake ground lost by traditional Hollywood genre films. This lost ground was both financial (the result of declining ticket sales) and ideological (a loss of the innocent belief in the values proposed by genres like the musical). The expanded image of VistaVision gives us not only a bigger picture onscreen, but also a clearer image of the contradictions and tensions that characterized significant examples of Hollywood genre production in the post-war period and their relationship to the culture of modernism.

John Belton's indispensable study <i>Widescreen Cinema</i> provides an exhaustively thorough history of widescreen production and exhibition from the earliest days of the cinema, up until the end of the twentieth century. Interest in and experimentation with wide screen formats is almost as old as the cinema itself. Belton details the fascinating and byzantine history of widescreen processes, paying particular attention to the industrial and entrepreneurial labor that went into the proliferation of widescreen cinema in the post World War II period, during which Hollywood ticket sales declined steeply. VistaVision was the Paramount studio's answer to the widescreen question, simply one technological alternative among an array of others that included CinemaScope, Cinerama, Natural Vision, SuperScope, and Todd-AO. I wish here to recapitulate the conditions that were to give rise to widescreen cinema, then to explain the VistaVision process and the considerations that led to <i>White Christmas</i> being used as the vehicle for the debut of the technology.
</p>

<p>
The decline in box office revenues in the post-war period was decisive in encouraging film studios to invent ways of luring spectators back to the cinemas. The causes of decline in movie attendance are well known, but can stand brief recapitulation here. Average weekly attendance at the cinema in the United States reached ninety million. But by 1952 this number had slipped to fifty one million&#x02014;in other words, attendance had declined by over forty per cent in less than five years.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Numerous historians have linked this decline to shifts in post-war culture that are familiar to everyone, yet worth recalling. Most significant of these, in terms of its impact on film attendance, was a redefinition of domestic life effected by rapid acceleration in the use of two technologies: the automobile and the television. The rapid increase in automobile ownership enabled many formerly urban members of the middle and lower middle classes to move to the suburbs. The post-war years witnessed the privileging of the suburban home as a site of recreation, particularly recreation centered around the television. Whereas urbanites might previously have gone out to the cinema for an evening's entertainment, the new suburbanites often preferred to stay at home, thus depriving the old movie houses of their regular audiences. And the car, in addition to its primary use as a means of commuting, began also to be deployed as a recreational technology in connection with the incipient practice of the day and weekend trip.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
For spectators to be lured back to the cinema, so the studios' thinking went, they would have to be offered something they could not get at home. Chiefly, this something was the pleasure of the large, color image, beside which the flickering black and white images of the television screen seemed a very poor relation. Cinema had to emphasize its unparalleled spectacularity, its specificity&#x02014;had to recall for its spectators an awareness of itself as an event. Widescreen formats, it was hoped, would perform this labor of seduction.
</p>

<p>
VistaVision was the Paramount studio's approach to this project of the "re-enchantment" of cinema. Twentieth Century-Fox introduced CinemaScope in 1953 with <i>The Robe</i> (Henry Koster, USA), a biblical epic starring Richard Burton. The advertising for the film billed it as "The first motion picture in CinemaScope&#x02014;the miracle you can see without glasses!" The glasses bit is a swipe at 3-D processes like that of MGM, which required spectators to don little spectacles to appreciate the spatial illusion of three-dimensionality. Despite this lack of a physical encumbrance for the spectator, CinemaScope was cumbersome to produce and exhibit. Its larger aspect ratio of 2.66:1 (compared to the standard 1.33:1) had to be produced using anamorphic lenses during shooting and projection. The necessity of the anamorphic lens meant exhibitors had to invest in new hardware, including ideally new, curved screens, in order to accommodate the new films. Aesthetically, despite the stunning new dimensions of the CinemaScope image, the process also had the disadvantage of appearing rather grainy, due to the fact that the image was essentially blown up by the anamorphic projection lens.
</p>

<p>
This thumbnail history of CinemaScope is necessary to understand the subsequent appearance of VistaVision. While other studios decided to purchase from Twentieth Century-Fox the rights to use this technology, Paramount held out, opting instead to return to an invention it had acquired the patent for in 1926, almost thirty years earlier.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The VistaVision image was produced by exposing the negative horizontally and then rotating it 90 degrees and reducing it to standard 35mm in the printing process. This produced a projected image that was longer and higher than traditional formats, with an aspect ratio that could range from 1.85:1 to 2:1. Though the image did not have the same panoramic breadth as CinemaScope, the image, because it had not been blown up anamorphically, was sharper and denser. Furthermore, exhibitors could project VistaVision with existing projection equipment.
</p>

<p>
In the discursive war of widescreen aesthetics, Paramount made much of VistaVision's extraordinary width <i>and</i> height and of the fact that the image did not suffer the loss of clarity and depth of field that were casualties of CinemaScope and other widescreen processes. While VistaVision could not actually provide the width of CinemaScope, Paramount sought to emphasize, in its promotional materials, that "height was equally important as width."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  This interest in height is signaled even by the VistaVision logo, with the exaggerated elongation of the second V, which clearly signifies this notion of height (<a href="#1"> 1</a>).
</p>

<p>
Paramount's decision to debut VistaVision with <i>White Christmas</i> was in many ways an odd one. The film is a backstage (or "show") musical about two soldiers, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) who meet in the European theater in 

<b></b>

World War II. Bob is already a successful entertainer; Phil talks his way into becoming Bob's sidekick in the post-war years. The two meet a pair of less successful singing sisters, Betty and Judy Haynes (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen), and follow them to a Vermont inn where the sisters have a Christmas gig. Once there, Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their commanding officer from World War II, General Waverly.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The General, visibly ashamed by the emasculating nature of his job, is further disgraced by impending financial ruin (a lack of snowfall in Vermont has kept visitors away from his inn). Bob and Phil and the Haynes sisters hatch a plan to put on a show at the inn to save the General. The usual generic obstacles ensue, but the usual generic happy denouement is achieved. </p>

We might think that the high and wide VistaVision image would have lent itself better to a movie set outdoors, maybe on the ski slopes, rather than the inside of a ski lodge. In fact, early tests for the technology were shot out of doors, in urban locations, so as to test the process against the demands of the dimensions of landscape. This idea that VistaVision should be used to photograph landscape seems to have lingered as an anxiety, for <i>VistaVision Visits Norway</i>, a short two-reel film, traveled with <i>White Christmas</i> in the theaters&#x02014;perhaps as a kind of insurance policy, or else as a message to spectators that Paramount really had a handle on the technology they were peddling.
</p>

<p>
However, the backstage musical seems to have afforded a different set of possibilities for exploring the enhanced dimensions of VistaVision. The genre implicitly emphasizes 

<b></b>

the theatrical and reflexive nature of its location, the site of performance&#x02014;the proscenium, the audience and, of course, the actual backstage that gives the sub-genre its name. The controlled conditions of this genre encourage, therefore, the show within the film to be staged in such a way that all of the increased dimensions and capacities of the VistaVision image are explored. <i>White Christmas</i> has the busiest and most expansive of mise-en-sc&#x000E9;nes: tap dancers descending from offscreen space above the frame, or else being hurled up into the image from below; a cavernous performance hall with a seemingly unlimited seating capacity and a proscenium stage capable of expanding magically in size that furthermore, in the film's last scene, opens onto a (clearly artificial) snowy (at last) landscape. Far from being a misuse of VistaVision technology, <i>White Christmas</i> seems more like an efficient clinical laboratory for testing its possibilities minutely.
</p>

<p>
The laboratory conditions of <i>White Christmas</i> can be sensed in the film's reflexive foregrounding of its sets. But before spectators were able see these sets for themselves, they were primed to pay attention to the film's emphasis on set design. In the film's pressbook, a marketing handbook for exhibitors formatted to look like a newspaper, one of the "articles" declares:"Some of the sets for 'White Christmas' were among the most elaborate ever built in Hollywood. Lavish night club interiors and the Vermont inn, complete with landscaping and barns, are outstanding examples of the time and money put into making the film one of the biggest in the history of the motion picture industry."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The article, of course, trumpets the use of VistaVision in anthropomorphizing terms:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In addition to its human stars . . . Paramount's lavishly produced presentation of Irving Berlin's "White Christmas" . . . has a fifth star&#x02014;VistaVision. 
<p class="blockquote">
	This is the name given to the revolutionary new filming process which, when projected on the theater screen, gives such a clear image that even the background shots look as if they were only a few feet away from the viewer.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
To urge spectators, in the same breath, to recognize the splendor of VistaVision and the expenditure on set design, is to implicitly suggest that appreciation of the former is achieved by attention to the latter.
</p>

<p>
The film was indeed expensive, costing close to four million dollars. More than ten percent of this total budget was spent on set design. The interiors and exteriors of General Waverly's Columbia Inn, the location where most of film takes place, cost close to $100,000&#x02014;a spectacular amount of money (especially considering the price of an actual house in 1954).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Not willing to hedge its bets, Paramount also spent a staggering $800,000 promoting the film, including purchasing tie-ins on popular television programs.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The investment evidently paid off, because <i>White Christmas</i> became one of the highest grossing films in Paramount's history, as well as the highest grossing film of 1954, earning gross receipts of twelve million dollars.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The studio's gamble on VistaVision and <i>White Christmas</i> would seem to have been far- and clear-sighted (so to speak).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Critical reviews were rather lukewarm or else simply tongue-in-cheek. The reviewer for <i>Variety</i> was predictably optimistic about the picture as a whole, but looked forward to VistaVision being put to more spectacular uses: "The widescreen process has an impressive vastness, with color clarity and sharp definition that add greatly to the visual quality of a production. VV's impact, while giving a full-stage effect to this musical, should be even greater when applied to outdoor and action-drama stories."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The middle-brow press was less convinced. The reviewer for <i>The New Yorker</i> picks on the poor marriage of subject and film technology: "Another big musical job is something called 'White Christmas' . . . It . . . serves as an introduction to a process called VistaVision. This is designed to show even more of the outdoors than we've got accustomed to with Cinerama and CinemaScope; paradoxically, many of the scenes here are indoors. But wider, higher, deeper, or how you will, 'White Christmas' is a bore."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  John O'Hara, writing in <i>Colliers</i>, was more wilting:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
<i>White Christmas</i> is photographed and projected in one of the new panoramic processes, this one called VistaVision. I guess I have seen most of the wide-screen devices and I now have an opinion on them. They're all right if you want to show the Battle of Bull Run (first or second) and they would have been just fine for the moving-up sequences in <i>The Big Parade</i>, an excellent motion picture for its time. But in ordinary sequences, just between or among a few persons, they make the actors too big and you too small. You feel no participating intimacy and hence no sympathetic relationship with the characters.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
While the first two responses I cite above are impatient with <i>White Christmas</i> as a widescreen exercise, O'Hara's feeling of being "too small" in front of the image suggests that although, by his reckoning, the technology may have been misapplied here, nonetheless the enlarged image has made its dimensions felt.
</p>

<p>
The awareness of the screen's size, an awareness, in other words, of the cinematic means of production at the expense of narrative identification and absorption, sounds suspiciously like an experience belonging to the domain of modernism. As noted before, <i>White Christmas</i> is not a modernist text; its auto-referentiality does not arrive at Feuer's "critical reflexivity." However, its production at a moment when a variety of practices recognized as modernist were entering the mainstream of U.S. cultural life, taken together with its privileging of its own manufacture through its mise-en-sc&#x000E9;ne, requires that we think more closely about what this film, which could justifiably be written off as the crassest of Hollywood products, might have to do with the means and aims of modernist aesthetic practice.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Furthermore, that question becomes more pressing when we pay attention to a nearly hysterical anti-modernist discourse that lies at the very center of the film's diegesis. At this point I wish to turn to the film proper in order to analyze more closely the function of its sets and the movement of the actors' bodies within them, deployed as a means of drawing attention to the purely formal properties of VistaVision cinema, and to further consider what this formal mapping has to do with the film's anti-modernist discourse.

Set Design, Dance and Anti-modernism

<p class="noIndent">
At several key moments the film draws lavish attention to its set design and forces a particular awareness of the artificiality of the sets as sets. The film opens with a musical Christmas Eve review being staged by Bob and Phil (again, Crosby and Kaye) somewhere at the European front in World War II. These opening scenes refer, obviously, back to the "source" of <i>White Christmas</i>&#x02014;1942's <i>Holiday Inn</i>, which saw yuletide sentimentality as the flipside of wartime patriotism.
</p>

<p>
Immediately following the credits, a painted backdrop occupies the full plane of the image, initially with the words "Christmas Eve 1944" superimposed over it. The backdrop depicts a typical New England landscape: in the middle of a snow-clad valley, a few wood-frame houses are presided over by a white-steepled church. We recognize the scene's falseness, but are also aware that we are being asked to accept this conventional representation of landscape as real. Such a practice of suspending scenographic disbelief is, after all, familiar to the spectator of classical Hollywood filmmaking. As the camera pulls back, however, this backdrop is revealed to be what we already knew it to be: an artificial piece of set design, with Bob and Phil performing a little song and dance routine in front of it. As the camera continues to withdraw from the backdrop, we are given to realize that this stage is set amid the ruins of a city, charred hulls of buildings towering to the side and in the background, soldiers seated before the stage, clapping in time to the music. The whole amounts to a deeply generic representation of "war-torn Europe." The larger set, however, within which the painted backdrop becomes only a tiny feature, does not ultimately pretend to be any more real than the backdrop, but rather (in all its fussy detail, in the unreal hues of its nighttime sky) seems openly to declare the film's investment in artifice, and in particular in the artifice of the set itself <i>as set</i>. In terms of detail, depth, width and height, the clarity of this set is meant to show off the capacities of VistaVision. An abandoned idea for the opening credit sequence would have pushed the reflexive attention to set design even more blatantly: miniatures of the various sets in the movie were to have been built and photographed as background to the credits.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This device of emphasizing the background and mise-en-sc&#x000E9;ne reappears throughout the film. Later, when Bob and Phil and the Haynes sisters are en route from Florida to Vermont in the dining car of a train, they break out into the song "Snow" (an example of how to stretch a really thin idea for a musical set-piece into an entire meta-representational exercise). At the same time the film essays an impromptu piece of set design: as the characters sing of snow, the camera observes in close up a white napkin and bits of a decorative pine tree that had decorated the table, an inprovisatory allusion to the same snowy New England landscape suggested earlier by the backdrop. In this instance the film seems to foreground the missing real scenery that should have been the proper subject of VistaVision technology (recall <i>VistaVision Visits Norway</i>). The production files from Paramount also reveal that this number, "Snow," was a last-minute-ish interpolation that replaced what should have been the "Winter Fantasia"&#x02014;a kind of spectacular dream sequence, ultimately deemed too expensive to shoot (but too expensive because of the expenditures already incurred in building the film's 

<b></b>

elaborate sets).<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  This table-top winter fantasia gestures obliquely to the re-shuffling of the film's budget, while also redirecting attention to budgetary expenditure on the sets of the Vermont Inn.
</p>

<p>
In fact, although all backstage musicals self-consciously display the effort required to mount a production, <i>White Christmas</i> draws an extraordinary degree of attention to the labor that has gone into its set-design. Inside the performance hall at the Columbia Inn, while the dancers are rehearsing, we hear the show's set-construction crew talking their trade ("Move that lumber over fellas!"). The labor of the performers and that of the set-designers are placed, momentarily, on the same plane of significance. Certainly the interiors of the inn are among the most spectacular in the film. The enormous height of the dinner theater and the dimensions of its stage are repeatedly insisted upon once the action arrives there. It is here, finally, that we are also made aware of the pressing historical context of declining movie ticket revenues that VistaVision was meant to reverse.
</p>

<p>
Due to a lack of snow since Thanksgiving, so the film tells us, General Waverly's inn has suffered a terrible decline in visitors. The giant, cavernous space of the inn's theater is clearly an analogue of the empty(ing or emptier) movie palaces across the U.S. The production staged by Bob and Phil is meant to correct this decline in visitors just as <i>White Christmas</i> was meant to do for Paramount. At the end of the "minstrel number" we see the film visualizing the historical conditions of the wide screen moment: as the spectacular number draws to a close, with Vera-Ellen's movement up and down the stage clearly charting the dimensions of the expanded image, the film cuts to the rehearsal audience (the general, his granddaughter, and nosy housekeeper), the empty theater extending into the gloom behind them. It will be precisely the spectacle of <i>White Christmas</i> that will fill this empty theater and its analogical double in the real world.
</p>

<p>
Curiously, though, this refilling of the auditorium, this summoning of spectators from their living rooms and televisions to the site of widescreen exhibition, is actually predicated <i>through</i> television. Bob makes his appeal to the members of General Waverley's troops to make a surprise visit to the Columbia Inn on Christmas Eve on the "Ed Harrison" show (read Ed Sullivan show, the most popular variety show of the time). In fact, it is precisely the distinguishing capabilities of television that are exploited by Bob to make his show at the Columbia Inn come off: the medium's immediacy; its existence as a part of the everyday life of its spectators; its ability to reach masses of people in different parts of the country, at the same moment in time. This diegetic exploitation of television in the service of the cinematic is clearly of a piece with the plugs for <i>White Christmas</i> that Paramount managed to air on several televised variety shows in the run-up to the film's release. This same deployment of television is actually visualized by the film itself when we see Bob's televised appeal to Waverley's troops as it is transmitted and watched on television monitors in Vermont and New York. Within the high and wide frame of the film's VistaVisual mise-en-sc&#x000E9;ne, the black and white televisual image never looked more puny and impoverished.
</p>

<p>
In charting the film's layers of reflexivity, I do not intend to engage in what Fredric Jameson has called the "weak idealism" of interpreting the film as an allegory of its 

<b></b>

own mode of production, a hermeneutic mode in which the critic " . . . posits the auto-referentiality of the work's detail, so that its former content on inspection proves to be the way in which the work itself comments on its newfound camera mobility, or speaks of its wide screen by way of new forms of landscape . . . ."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  I do believe that part of the film's meaning can be apprehended in this manner, but understanding the film only as a reflexive allegory of itself does not do justice to its complexity.
</p>

<p>
Jameson agrees with Feuer's periodization of the 1950s as a moment characterized by what he calls the "belated" emergence of "sound-filmic" modernism ("EI," 183). He connects the emergent self-consciousness of film production at this moment to the wide screen phenomenon and the decline of the self-evident legitimacy of genre filmmaking: "The introduction of the 'wide screen' in 1952, with its overdetermined technological and economic situation (end of the studio system, introduction of television), is also emblematic of this mutation in aesthetics itself, which renders the modest on-going practice of the traditional genres somehow uncomfortable, if not intolerable" ("EI," 177). Jameson's characterization of this period might be criticized on a number of grounds. Film historians will protest that the wide screen was not "introduced" in 1952 (Jameson might have written "consolidation" rather than "introduction"). Furthermore, the studios decided to continue making genre films, particularly musicals, in part as a response to surveys indicating that these were the films people wanted to see. And the short-lived increase in ticket revenues in 1953 (for the first time since 1946) seems to have borne out, at least financially and momentarily, the wisdom of this decision.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Thus we wonder how "intolerable" the genre film was for either its producers or its spectators. Nonetheless, Jameson's essential point seems to me entirely correct: faced with a shift in aesthetics towards modernism, the genre film could not but reflect on itself with a self-consciousness that could justifiably be characterized as "uncomfortable."
</p>

<p>
We witness such uncomfortable reflexivity in a scene that arrives almost exactly midway through the film. This is the rehearsal for the number called "Choreography," in which modern dance is unflatteringly pitted against tap dancing&#x02014;a Hollywood staging of the old quarrel between the ancients and moderns. The scene raises the issue of modernist aesthetic practice as constituting a threat to generic entertainment. It does so by forcing the dancers' bodies, in particular Judy's (Vera-Ellen's) and Johnny's (John Brascia's), to graph, through their movements, the dimensions of the VistaVision image.
</p>

<p>
"Choreography," as mentioned above, arrives almost exactly halfway into the film. Two major narrative events directly precede the number: First, Bob and Betty (Crosby and Clooney) convene over milk and sandwiches late at night in the performance hall. They cement their attraction to one another by doing a duet of "Count Your Blessings" and sharing a kiss. This scene is followed by one between Bob and General Waverly in which the General learns that the Army has rejected his request to rejoin active military service. This disappointment sets in motion Bob's aforementioned appearance on television to request that former members of the General's company attend the Christmas Eve spectacular that will be the film's finale.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  This same appearance on television constitutes the temporary obstacle to Bob and Betty's union at the film's end. 

<b></b>

Thus, these two scenes are central to the demands of the basic narrative conventions of the backstage musical: romantic coupling and the production of a show. Following directly on the heels of these narrative events is "Choreography," a shrill warning against the menace posed to these same conventions by modernism.
</p>

<p>
The number, which poses as a full dress rehearsal, begins with Phil (Kaye) in tight black pants and turtleneck, a black beret on his head, accompanied by six female dancers in plain grey smocks, each with long hair pulled back in a severe ponytail. Together they move across the stage jerkily, their bodies adopting angular poses, expressions of dramatic intensity on their faces. The music is dissonant, arrhythmic: squealing horns, shrieking strings, ominous kettledrums. The stage is framed in back by a kind of spare grid of red latticing, with occasional in-fills of blue wall; attached to the latter are what appear to be fragments of ancient sculptural friezes, a small, asymmetrical pyramid of steps sits in back, adjoining the grid. The entire tableau is obviously meant to read: "modernism." The dancing a parody of Martha Graham, the set low-grade Mondrian.
</p>

<p>
After the Graham-like intro, the music shifts into a bouncy, swingtime sound, and Phil, now moving like a seasoned vaudevillian, begins to sing:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
Chaps who did taps <br />
Aren't tapping anymore <br />
They're doing choreography. <br />
Chicks who did kicks <br />
Aren't kicking anymore  <br />
They're doing choreography. <br />
Heps who did steps <br />
That would stop the show in days that used to be, <br />
Through the air they keep flying <br />
Like a duck that is dying. <br />
Instead of dance it's choreography.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
This song ends with Phil and his dancers huddled together near the floor in another Graham-esque pose. They look up to see, descending from the ceiling, a pair of thin legs in pink stockings. Once the feet hit the floor, one foot and then the other taps at an impossible speed while Phil and company look on in amazement. The camera pulls back to reveal that these legs belong to Judy who proceeds to tap-dance Phil and his modern dancers into submission. In this heroic battle of aesthetics, she is aided by Johnny who bounds onto the screen from the offscreen space beneath the stage, precisely complementing Judy's descent from above. As Phil and his dancers are coerced into cooperation with Judy and Johnny, modernism, at least for the moment, appears to have been vanquished so that traditional entertainment can reclaim its endangered, apparently tenuous, hegemony (. <a href="#2a">2a</a> and <a href="#2b">2b</a>).
</p>

<p>
This satire of modernist dance&#x02014;which, by the way, is as absurd as it is entertaining&#x02014;was actually anticipated by a similar attack on Martha Graham performed by the Denishawn dance company almost twenty years earlier, in 1937 in New York. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, who founded Denishawn in 1915, were pioneers of modern 

<b></b>

dance in the United States. Shawn's choreography embraced athleticism and sought to distance dance, especially in pieces choreographed for his male dancers, from its association with effeminacy. He was interested in reviving and reworking elements of American folk traditions in his choreography, which gave his work a hybrid feeling of experimentation and conservatism. Martha Graham was actually a student at Denishawn, but as she moved to articulate her own modernist choreography that broke much more radically with traditional movement, she also moved outside the orbit of Shawn's affections. The rupture between Shawn and Graham explains the fact that in the middle of Shawn's dance epic <i>O libertad!</i>, he himself appeared in a piece entitled "Depression" in which he performed a parody of a Graham-like character described as: "a hag in robes, ringlets and a frightening mask."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
"Choreography" is actually part of a tradition in Hollywood filmmaking of taking pot shots at modern art and the culture of modernism. A similar swipe at modernism via dance occurs in <i>Funny Face</i> (Stanley Donen, USA, 1957) when the Audrey Hepburn character, Jo Stockton, performs a modernist dance number in a left bank caf&#x000E9;. In an article entitled "The Childish, the Insane and the Ugly: The Representation of Modern Art in Popular Films and Fiction of the Forties," Diane Waldman surveys a number of genre films to explore how Hollywood's "attacks on modern art pander to the lowest common denominator, anti-intellectualism, xenophobia and redbaiting" but also "point to the very real class nature of artistic taste, the gap between high and mass culture."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Similarly, in an influential essay on the musical, "Entertainment and Utopia," Richard Dyer points to the numbers from both <i>Funny Face</i> and <i>White Christmas</i> as examples of the way in which the films insist on the "contradiction between art and entertainment."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  While both articles are immensely useful, and while I agree with Waldman's observation about the class alignment, in Hollywood filmmaking, of "high" and "low" (or in her terms "mass") culture, I want to explore "Choreography" a bit more closely in order to muddy these too-clear distinctions between high and low, elite and mass, art and entertainment, modernism and Hollywood.

The difference between the movements of the "modern" dancers and the tap dancers in "Choreography" could not be clearer. However, when we look at the scene as a whole and discount, for a moment, its obvious anti-modernism, the picture becomes rather more complicated. Judy's descent from above and Johnny's leap from below are clearly choreographed so as to demonstrate the increased height of the VistaVision image. Meanwhile the scenographic lattice-grid, itself an example of modernist design-sensibility, functions as a very literal graph of the dimensions of the image. Both the grid and the Graham-esque movement are clearly indicated as belonging to a modernism against which the tap dancers must struggle. However, the function of the descending and ascending bodies is exactly that of the modernist grid: to demonstrate the spatial and visual properties of VistaVision. From a purely formal-technological point of view, there is no contradiction between the scene's modernist elements and its elements of traditional entertainment. Both perform the work of demonstrating the sensuous properties of the image <i>as</i> image; both, it might be argued, perform the work of modernism, what Clement Greenberg has characterized as a "pure preoccupation with the invention and arrangement of spaces, surfaces, shapes, colors . . . ."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Of course, there is nothing at all "pure" about <i>White Christmas</i>. But neither, as recent art history has demonstrated, is there anything pure about modernism.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  While the cross-contamination of mass culture and high or elite cultures associated with modernism has been well researched in other disciplines, less attention has been paid to this question in film history. When Hollywood and modernism have been studied together, what is most often demonstrated is Hollywood's practice of "importing" an avant-garde, the most famous example being the emigration of German filmmakers to Hollywood during the years of fascism. Meanwhile, in the literature on the cinematic American avant-garde of the 1950s, 1960s, and beyond, consistent attention has been paid to the way in which avant-gardists have appropriated elements of mass culture 

<b></b>

and Hollywood filmmaking in their own radical practices (e.g., Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger, etc.).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Both of these tendencies conceive of the relationship between Hollywood and modernism as one characterized by a two-way street of appropriation. Instead, I would like to try to conceptualize a way of seeing both occupying the same territory, together at once.
</p>

<p>
Compare, for instance, the experimentation on the properties of the image in "Choreography," that moment when Vera-Ellen's leg enters the film frame from above, with the first shot of Maya Deren's <i>Meshes of the Afternoon</i> (USA, 1944), perhaps the most famous of American avant-garde films, in which a mannequin's arm extends, uncannily, into the frame from the top of the image to place a paper flower on the pavement (. <a href="#3a">3a</a> and <a href="#3b">3b</a>). What separates these two cinematic moments?
</p>

<p>
Deren's intention was to explore in detail, almost scientifically, the properties of cinematic representation, the cinema's ability to expand and challenge our sense of space and time.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Of course, in terms of these films' cultural circulation, the way they were funded and produced, the worlds they inhabited and were directed towards, <i>everything</i> separates them. And yet, I think we miss out on a richer appreciation of both film history and the wider cultural history of which film history is but one part, if we insist on isolating these two examples of cinematic experimentation from one another, arranging them side by side in separate but equal compartments.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The mutual implication of aesthetic modernism and genre filmmaking of which <i>White Christmas</i> is an example becomes even more intriguing when we continue to consider the face-off between modernist dance and tap as a competition between two forms of specialized labor. On the one hand, modern dance is itself fundamentally about labor&#x02014;about presenting itself as a form of labor, of bodily exertion that is not effaced as exertion. Modernist dance, as Deborah Jowitt explains, intends on making visible and sensuously apparent an understanding of its art as work and struggle in its ". . . engaging parts of the body in adversary relationships to each other . . . [and its] accentuating the power of gravity . . . "<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Tap, in many ways, with its machinic sounds and Fordist rhythms, is also about labor, but in a different way&#x02014;it wants to reinforce a myth of this labor's carefree spontaneity.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Whereas the dance that the Graham-esque dancers in "Choreography" perform is made to look foolishly labored, Vera-Ellen's performance is sheer virtuosity that seems to generate itself effortlessly while also reminding us of the unusual talent required to dance in just this way. Meanwhile, Danny Kaye's clownish attempts at modernist dancing suggest that just about anyone could do it, a too-familiar layperson's complaint against modernist aesthetic practices. Consonantly, this entire performance, with its putatively opposed modernist and traditional film musical elements, is entirely in the service of demonstrating the value of this cinematic image, courtesy of Paramount and VistaVision&#x02014;an image whose own value (we are meant to recognize, at least implicitly) derives from the labor gone into producing it, a recognition also encouraged by the studio's publicity.
</p>

<p>
The song sung by Danny Kaye in "Choreography" that I quoted above reads interestingly like a complaint made by the worker whose services are no longer required by the reorganization, at a macro level, of labor and capital. In a sense this song is dead

<b></b>

right, though he is not the victim of modernism, or even of modernist "choreography," but rather of forces in the world of which cinematic modernism is but an index. The shift in labor practices concomitant with the devolution of the studio system is one major cause to which historians attribute the decline of the musical; studios could no longer afford to keep on their steady payroll the artists and technicians necessary to make musicals. Thus, the musical, as the shrillness of this protest clearly, though unintentionally, signifies, was on its way out, despite Vera-Ellen's magnificent success. Seeing "Choreography" as an index of the re-organization in the economic sphere would, of course, fit very neatly with Jameson's periodization of a shift in aesthetics in the 1950s and 1960s that is coincident with the reorganization of capital and labor at a global level.

The (often bizarre) investment in and investigation of the cinematic image as form and as technology that we see in <i>White Christmas</i> sits, I want to argue here, towards one end of a continuum of cultural and aesthetic practices. On the other end of this continuum sits modernist and avant-garde filmmaking with its own exploration of the dimensions and possibilities of the image. The film, in other words, shares with modernism what Greenberg has called its "dissolution of the pictorial into sheer texture, into apparently sheer sensation, into an accumulation of repetitions."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Greenberg would undoubtedly object to my using his words to discuss here the effects of <i>White Christmas</i>. The film is, after all, undeniably (if not irredeemably) kitsch. In this article I have not intended to suggest that there are no distinctions to be made between the properties of serious high modernism and the properties of the Hollywood musical, however reflexive the latter may be. Rather, I propose a modification to the truism that high culture and low culture either exist purely in opposition, or that they dialectically feed off and into one another, since the language used to describe our experience of the modernist art work can also be used to describe a work like <i>White Christmas</i>. Scholarship that identifies elite culture's debt to mass culture, and/or their seepage into one another, leaves us nonetheless secure in our belief that the two are still, after all, distinguishable. In scholarship and criticism of this sort, Greenberg's binaries remain, I believe, very much in place. Perhaps we are increasingly accustomed to an avant-garde that looks kitschy, or kitsch that seems avant-garde, although we seldom mistake one for the other. The questions I want to pose in and through <i>White Christmas</i> are these: Wouldn't it be more exciting and gratifying, perhaps even useful, if serious modernist art were as immediately apprehensible and could reach as many people as the Hollywood musical did in its day? And wouldn't it be invigorating and salubrious, even, if mass art strove towards the self-conscious rigor of high modernism? Might modernism become more popular and mass art more thoughtful? I think this is something that Eisenstein was trying to discover in his cinema of attractions and Brecht in his epic theater. Some degraded, kitschy version of this desire survives and is recoverable in <i>White Christmas</i>. Thinking and seeing modernism in and through <i>White Christmas</i> might be a way out of the bind that maintains our belief that the avant-garde and kitsch need be so ineluctably locked in their places; might be a way of understanding, that is, Frank O'Hara's seriousness when, upon emerging from a screening of <i>A Star is Born</i> in 1954, he remarked about Judy Garland's peformance: "Well, I guess she's <i>better</i> than Picasso."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

Among the recognizably modernist practices entering mainstream cultural life in the U.S. at this time, we might make brief mention of the growing public awareness of the non-representational avant-gardes in painting and sculpture (Pollock, David Smith, et al) and a middle-to-upper brow interest in the European cinematic avant-garde, particularly Italian neorealism.

In an essay on Jean-Fran&#x000E7;ois Lyotard, "Modernism and the End of Beauty," Calvin Bedient raises the vital question of the place of aestheticism in our dark age. He asks what art has lost in the postmodern era; specifically, he asks whether the notion of beauty based on "a Hellenic ideal of a harmony of the mind and senses" (prescribed by Arnold and Pater and "revived, in however altered a manner," by modernist writers) is plausible after the death camps.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Bedient connects that idea of beauty with eros and, paradoxically, with the death drive, as the presence of the sublime&#x02014;of what we might, perhaps, call epiphanic moments&#x02014;cannot be unlinked from death. (It is this pairing that Bedient deftly calls the "jack-in-the-box terrorism of eros" ["MEB," 109]). And indeed, a return to the origins of this particular ethos in modernism (the epiphanic ethos, which eroticizes the sudden discovery of meaning in a wider context of ultimate meaninglessness) together with a closer engagement with its early proponent, Walter Pater, suggest an unmistakable, decadent preoccupation not just with death in the abstract, but with corpses and ghosts. That preoccupation seems both ironic and prescient in retrospect, after a corpse-strewn century in which it is hard to imagine an experimental literature <i>not</i> haunted by bodies.
</p>

<p>
Epiphany, by definition, emerges from darkness. But how is the darkness of a writerly sensibility half in love with easeful death (a sensibility which knew nothing of industrialized warfare, let alone atomic or mechanized killing) in any traceable or meaningful way linked to the darkness of the world itself? What is its connection with the resultant miasma inhabited by any would-be aesthete, in the postmodern era? How can dead bodies, eroticized by Pater, still be aestheticized by any writer of conscience, no matter how in love with Renaissance art? The noted Holocaust scholar Laurence Langer poses the issue this way in his <i>Holocaust Testimonies: The Ruins of Memory</i>: "Helena B. [a Holocaust survivor] . . . tells of the day when a friend came up to her . . . carrying a woman's <i>foot</i>. . . . Whatever the exact cause, the fragmentation of the physical self conveyed by this stark image remains overpowering. [ . . . ] Among the many victims of the Holocaust was the classical idea of the beauty of the human <i>form</i>" (emphasis in original).<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Bedient writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
As if heeding Matthew Arnold and Pater, the modernists revived, in however altered a manner, the Hellenic ideal of a harmony of the mind and senses. . . . But this ideal has 

<b></b>

died in a horde of destructions. For the most part, today's art has lost erotic eagerness. . . . Though this collapse of the body as an enjoying substance (in a Lacanian phrase) began long before the death camps, if not long before the Great War, the shame oozing from the camps is its inescapable sign and explanation. And this shame <i>can</i> be articulated.

Bedient goes on to cite Primo Levi, expert on shame, but his general point about its articulability is reminiscent of W. G. Sebald declaring that the conscientious writer&#x02014;in this case, Peter Weiss, but the same might be said of Sebald himself&#x02014;binds himself on a wheel in which absolution is only to be gained by the continual re-representation of humanity's cruelty. This is far from "beauty" as we understand it. Nonetheless an examination of Sebald's work, of the artists he prefers and the way he looks at their paintings, suggests that we may still be permitted a sense of beauty for moments at a time if those moments are predicated on a recognition of that which is out of joint, perverted, twisted&#x02014;of that which has potential to spoil the beautiful picture and, at the same time, makes it truthful in an age of atrocities.
</p>

<p>
Sebald thus represents the end-point (for the moment) of a process begun by Walter Pater in <i>The Renaissance</i>, his celebration of the odd, the oblique, and the striking in painterly representations, particularly of the human face and body. For Pater, such attention to oddity represents a subversive unorthodoxy. It is intimately tied to his queerness at a time when homosexuality was outlawed in England, and it inaugurates a modernist vision insistent upon the seemingly offhand, yet ultimately significant image or moment. Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps perversely inserted here in a discussion linking the proto-modernist Pater and the postmodern Sebald, is instructive as a postmodern Romantic yearning for beauty in an era of extreme violations. It is no accident that the main characters in his story of a charred body, <i>The English Patient</i>, are an explorer, a sapper, a nurse, and a thief. Because of their vocations, all of these res are compelled to be exceptionally attentive to what others overlook. They must notice telltale signs and symptoms and attend to them. Detail cannot elude them. (Yet all except the eponymous central re are confounded by a mystery: who is this patient Englishman who lies in their midst, half revealing secrets? Is he English at all?) Their world is the chiaroscuro world of the Renaissance painter Caravaggio, who reveals details in all their sordid humanity in an atmosphere of darkness penetrated by oblique light. They must find their way in a literal minefield by locating the details that matter.
</p>

<p>
In her book <i>Reading in Detail: Aesthetics and the Feminine</i>, the late feminist theorist Naomi Schor interrogates the classical contempt for details, and examines their increasing prestige in the twentieth century (especially in the post-structuralist era):
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[A]s any historian of ideas knows, the detail has until very recently been viewed in the West with suspicion if not downright hostility. The censure of the particular is one of the enabling gestures of neo-classicism, which recycled into the modern age the classical equation of the Ideal with the absence of all particularity. The normative aesthetics of neo-classicism did not, however, simply fade away upon the advent of Romanticism; 

<b></b>

constantly reinscribed throughout the nineteenth century they continue to resurface well into the twentieth, constituting the indelible marker of nostalgics of the Ideal. . . . Viewed in a historical perspective, the ongoing valorization of the detail appears to be an essential aspect of that dismantling of Idealist metaphysics which looms so large on the agenda of modernity.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The nostalgia for classical perfection that carries on into the twentieth century manifests itself in the politics of racial perfection, with the idea of the perfect physical type and the subhuman race that sullies the picture of human perfectibility. This is a metaphysics insistent on the wiping-out of difference, and, according to some thinkers, the end point of Enlightenment idealism, whose light was ultimately so bright that difference appeared as a blot. "Is the detail feminine?" asks Schor (<i>RiD</i>, 11), and concludes that, inasmuch as it is associated with d&#x000E9;cor and domesticity, with both the ornamental and the quotidian, and with that which distracts from the central icons of masculine hierarchy, it is. "[W]hat is most threatening about the detail [is] its tendency to subvert an internal hierarchic ordering of the work of art which clearly subordinates the periphery to the center, the accessory to the principal, the foreground to the background" (<i>RiD</i>, 20). Pater's attention to intimations and obliquities was similarly threatening to the authorities of Oxford and the conservatives of his intellectual circle, who condemned the so-called hedonism of his prescription for aesthetic attentiveness and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Mieke Bal, another feminist art historian, carries on Schor's project in her own critique of Enlightenment oversimplifications and her insistence on the ethics of the detail&#x02014;or rather on the ethics of reading the detail, and reading it against the grain of conventional interpretation. Her argument in <i>Reading "Rembrandt": Beyond the Word-Image Opposition </i>is directed consistently against "the logos turned doxa, the general cultural interpretation of the text which is, in <i>its</i> turn, a misreading."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  To this end, Bal attends to the oblique detail. Her introduction contains a rumination on Vermeer's well-known painting <i>Woman Holding a Balance </i>(ca. 1662&#x02013;4), which itself contains an image of the <i>Last Judgment</i> hanging on the wall behind the woman. Bal's attention is deflected, however, by a nail and hole the painter has included in the wall to the left of the painting, emphasized by the light entering the window in front of the woman. These compel speculation:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For me [Bal is here at pains to emphasize the subjectiveness of reading paintings] it was the nail and the hole that the light made visible, produced; that instigated a burst of speculative fertility. When I saw this nail, the hole, and the shadows, I was fascinated: I could not keep my eyes off them. . . .<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The painter surely did not need to <i>paint</i> the nail and the hole, even if, in setting up his studio, he actually may have displaced the <i>Last Judgment</i>.
<p class="blockquote">. . . The nail and the hole, both visual elements to which no iconographic meaning is attached, unsettle the poetic description and the passively admiring gaze that it triggered, and dynamize the activity of the viewer.

<p>
This dynamic activity is the one embodied in a modernist ur-text, Virginia Woolf's early short story "The Mark on the Wall" &#x02014;a work essential to an understanding 

<b></b>

of modernist subjectivism and subversiveness. In "The Mark on the Wall," the narrator gazes at the eponymous spot and free associates; that free association is both the aesthetic of the story&#x02014;the mode the story is built in, its style&#x02014;and its ethos. The ruminating narrator is a rebellious soul averse to hierarchical orderings and "generalizations," and her stream-of-consciousness constitutes a reaction against such imposed structures and strictures.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  To attach one's eye to a small spot and let the mind wander is to free oneself of what Bal calls "doxa," official interpretations that hide truth or stunt imagination; Woolf's story contains numerous examples of such doxa, beginning, paradoxically, with "that old fancy"&#x02014;paradoxically because fancy, in the sense of whimsicality, is precisely what the story would seem to endorse. In this case, however, a fancy is a kind of old myth, an enshrined image that imprisons consciousness: "that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower . . . and . . . the cavalcade of red knights riding up the side of the black rock. . . . [I]t is an old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  It is a moment remarkably similar to that later moment in Woolf's 1927 novel <i>To the Lighthouse</i> when Mrs. Ramsay, letting her mind wander, suddenly finds herself uttering the phrase "We are in the hands of the Lord" and instantly reprimands herself for the automatism and insincerity of the sentiment. Such doxa keep us from discovering our own subjective truths; worse, they can be used to mask atrocity. The feudal romance of knights aestheticizes the violence knights do; moreover, such romances imprison women writers, since the female re, most likely inside the tower, cannot act for herself but can only be rescued, abducted, at best wooed.
</p>

<p>
As Perry Meisel has suggested in <i>The Absent Father: Virginia Woolf and Walter Pater</i>, from the mix of Woolf's feminist and aestheticist sensibilities she derived, through Pater, the inclination to privilege play, happy accident, and contingency over fixed assumptions. The Woolfian mode of observation is a form of inattentive attention that allows the unorthodox and the seemingly incidental to occupy center stage in the mind long enough to un-do certainties about the way the world works or what one "should" believe, but not long enough to harden into new doxa. Wolfgang Iser calls this spirit in Pater simply "scepticism": "The sceptical, relative spirit," he writes, "is a countervailing force, subverting and undoing all frameworks set up by the filing system of the human mind. It releases the facts from their subservience to general principles to which they have been yoked by the absolute spirit. In undercutting all normative ordering, it highlights open-endedness . . . "<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Carried on into our late age, this Paterianism involves a restoration; not a regeneration, precisely, but a re-revealment of what has been deliberately hidden or, in Paul Celan's words "written asunder."

Here is John Ruskin lecturing on Botticelli&#x02014;all Victorian reassurance:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[In the Uffizi's "Judith and Holofernes," Judith] is returning to the camp of Israel, followed by her maid carrying the head of Holofernes. And she walks in one of Botticelli's light dancing actions, her drapery all on flutter. . . .

<b></b>

<p class="blockquote">
	And at first glance&#x02014;you will think the re merely a piece of fifteenth-century affectation. "Judith, indeed!&#x02014;say rather the daughter of Herodias, at her mincingest." 
<p class="blockquote">
	Well, yes&#x02014;Botticelli <i>is</i> affected. . . . And he likes twisting the fingers of hands about, just as Correggio does. But he never does it like Correggio, without cause. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Look at Judith again,&#x02014;at her face, not her drapery. . . . 
<p class="blockquote">
	[Y]ou will feel . . . that [Judith] is not merely the Jewish Delilah to the Assyrian Samson; but the mightiest, purest, brightest type of high passion in severe womanhood offered to our human memory. Sandro's picture is but slight; but it is true to her. . . .<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Ruskin looks past unorthodoxy, past multiplicity and confusion&#x02014;myriad folds, queerly turned fingers&#x02014;to purity, single-mindedness, chaste Victorian femininity. Here, Walter Pater describes Botticelli's Virgin Mary:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[W]ith Botticelli she too . . . is one of those who are neither for Jehovah nor for his enemies. . . . Her trouble is in the very caress of the mysterious child, whose gaze is always far from her, and who has already that sweet look of devotion which men have never been able altogether to love, and which still makes the born saint an object almost of suspicion to his earthly brethren. Once, indeed, he guides her hand to transcribe in a book the words of her exaltation. . . . But the pen almost drops from her hand, and the high cold words have no meaning for her, and her true children are those others, among whom, in her rude home, the intolerable honour came to her . . . &#x02014;gipsy [sic.] children, such as those who, in Appenine villages, still hold out their long brown arms to beg of you, but on Sundays become <i>enfants du choeur</i>, with their thick black hair nicely combed, and fair white linen on their sunburnt throats. 
<p class="blockquote">. . . [Botticelli] paints Madonnas, but they shrink from the pressure of the divine child, and plead in unmistakable undertones for a warmer, lower humanity.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
It is the very opposite move to Ruskin's. Where Ruskin wishes to right wrongs&#x02014;a misperception of unorthodoxy, of art for art's sake (an idea Ruskin vehemently eschews), of pleasure in virtuosity and neglect of virtue&#x02014;Pater prefers a sinister interpretation. Just as Pater detects leftwardness in Leonardo&#x02014;who begins his career as an individual painter by executing an angel in the "left-hand corner" of a Verrocchio Baptism of Christ; whose John the Baptist and other smiling res have "a touch of something sinister"; who, "though he handles sacred subjects continually, . . . is the most profane of painters"; to whom the Renaissance itself is "that rebellion, that sinister claim for liberty of heart and thought" (<i>R</i>, 16)&#x02014;he discovers the human, earthy needs beneath the madonna's garb of saintliness. And as he sees Botticelli projected on his madonnas, Pater projects himself on Botticelli, with his ambivalence&#x02014;"neither for Jehovah nor his enemies"&#x02014;and his virtuosity that betrays forbidden orientations. ("Pater's refusal to oppose religion is a refusal to engage in dogmatic disputes," says Richard Dellamora. Dellamora quotes Pater on his suppression of the original conclusion to <i>The Renaissance</i>, wishing to "avoid 'well-recognised controversy, with rigidly defined opposites, exhausting the intelligence and limiting one's sympathies.")<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Discernible in Pater's famous purple prose is his desire to spill over, and his interpretations demonstrate his sympathy with others who, like him, are subject to efforts at containment; as Dellamora writes, "Pater subtly alters current . . . theory by reading the myths to 

<b></b>

which he directs his attention as the coded protest of marginalized groups."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Gypsies, it happens&#x02014;those untamed persons who, like the madonna, are Christians on Sunday and dirty, demanding, uncontainable when no religious authority is looking&#x02014;are among the most marginalized peoples of Europe; they were the only group besides Jews the Nazis singled out for extermination.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  If Pater could not foresee this, he nonetheless knew what gypsies represented: unpoliceable energy, an elusive mobility that threatens propriety.
</p>

<p>
Pater comes from the edges to unsettle the center, an approach which cost him something in his own career as Oxford don and compelled him publicly to retract some of his more overt statements endorsing a life of aesthetic pleasure. His influence, however, remained; as Denis Donoghue, one of his biographers, writes, "Pater is a shade or trace in virtually every writer of any significance from Hopkins and Wilde to Ashbery."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Donoghue's trope of "shade or trace" is deliberately chosen, as Pater deals throughout his writerly career primarily in chiaroscuro and communes with res he perceives as ghosts. He detects something haunting in the lives and pictures he gazes at, a residue or hidden truth "d'outre tombe" (<i>R</i>, 59) that betrays itself in expression or gesture, or simply in the pattern of light against dark&#x02014;for light is always defined as contrast to, or difference from, dark.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> To Pater the modernists owe their conception of epiphany, the visionary glimpse defined against the dullness of habit or the obscurity of mere background. As in Caravaggio (a painter impossible not to think of in connection with Pater's chiaroscuro and his focus on unorthodox lives, early deaths, and homoerotic proclivities), such glimpses are not by definition elevated or metaphysical, but can reveal a magus's unclean foot soles or a saint's encrusted nails. ("[A] taste for metaphysics may be one of those things we must renounce," writes Pater in the chapter on Winckelmann.) David Trotter describes the sensuous focus of Pater's art criticism as "let[ting] loose in the mind a palpable instability. What is at issue . . . may be . . . dirt, seepage, stickiness"&#x02014;the messy stuff rejected by orthodoxies and order-mongerers.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  It is, in short, an aestheticism that does not necessarily favor prettiness over truth; nor, on the other hand, does it reject prettiness as mere embellishment in favor of a higher moral purpose, as Ruskin does.
</p>

<p>
Such an aestheticism implies an ethics as well, one that eschews the untouchability mandated by caste, homophobia, or precious (Ruskinian) attitudes toward the art object. Pater's responsiveness to art, and to the artists whose spirit he strives to imagine and embody, is tactile, fleshly, physical rather than metaphysical. He locates his own attitude in Abelard's love of Heloise: "he tries to find a ground of reality below the abstractions of philosophy, as one bent on trying all things by their congruity with human experience, who had felt the hand of Heloise"(<i>R</i>, 5). His mode of reading&#x02014;or rather, of looking&#x02014;attends to the body and its signs; he sees gestures, indications, of desire and unorthodoxy, in hands or drapery, the very details Ruskin wishes to deny. This is partly because he values the act of looking in and of itself, an attitude Donoghue repeatedly emphasizes: "Pater's sentences ask to be read as if they wanted to be looked at, not merely to be understood" (<i>WP</i>, 133); "[a]t the beginning [of an essay], he seems merely to be looking at something, not very closely" (<i>WP</i>, 308). "Not merely 

<b></b>

to be understood": Pater's unorthodoxy stands the normal looking-reading hierarchy on its head, suggesting that "merely" to take in (the receptive attitude) might be more valuable than interpretation or theorizing (the imposing attitude). As Donoghue writes, "To work undisturbed by any moral ambition is itself a moral ambition" (<i>WP</i>, 132). Pater's aesthetic suggests an ethical reading mode for a dark time: not to cast excessive light on the object, rather to keep an open eye toward the small light the object itself might cast. To see this light, the reader must be unprejudiced, even, in a way, unfocused: looking directly at something may yield less vital information than gazing obliquely.
</p>

<p>
Upon Pater's death, Henry James damned him with the following faint praise: "He reminds me, in the disturbed midnight of our actual literature, of one of those lucent matchboxes which you place, on going to bed, near the candle, to show you, in the darkness, where you can strike a light: he shines in the uneasy gloom&#x02014;vaguely, and has a phosphorescence, not a flame" (cited in <i>WP</i>, 14). In a 1974 assessment, Harold Bloom "venture[d] the prophecy that [Pater] will prove . . . to be the valued precurser of a Post-Modernism still fated to be another Last Romanticism."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Given the human histories of fire, to be merely phosphorescent in this post-Holocaust, post-Hiroshima age might be the most moral way of shedding light on a subject. In <i>Rings of Saturn</i>, W. G. Sebald devotes a lengthy excursus to the peculiar phosphorescence of the over-fished herring, contrasting the herring's gleam to man's "relentless conquest of darkness" and its resulting horrific conflagrations.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Pater's held-over, skeptical Romanticism, his unassuming glow, is surely the appropriate ethos for any postmodern work that attempts to celebrate beauty in a century of burned bodies.

Ondaatje: Reading by Candlelight
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
There is no one way to read in <i>The English Patient</i>. All the characters are readers of a sort; they read for a living, indeed, they read for their lives&#x02014;and others'. Hana, the nurse, must read the symptoms of soldiers too incapacitated to voice needs. She also spends a portion of the book reading aloud&#x02014;to the English patient, who is an explorer, a mapmaker, a reader of landscapes as well as an avid autodidactic reader of classical texts. Kip, the Indian sapper, reads landscapes and furniture for hidden mines; he reads the insides of bombs. (People can also be bombs&#x02014;they are certainly texts&#x02014;in this novel about dangerous human potentialities, hidden possibilities of explosion.) Caravaggio the thief read the shadowy interiors of Toronto houses before the war; now his skills of discovery are employed by the English for spying.
</p>

<p>
There is no one way of reading, nor is reading unidirectional. Spies espy spies. Love is described as a mutual act of reading, discernment. War is a process of two sides out-reading one another. Each time a bomb mechanism is correctly interpreted, the Germans change their strategy; Kip must look for the "new joke" inside the bomb. The written guidelines are insufficient; the sapper's acts of interpretation must arise unassisted. The English patient is the most elusive text within the novel. Because of its title, the identification sticks with readers; although Alm&#x000E1;sy's "true" identity is revealed by Caravaggio (the spy-espying spy) long before the novel's end, nonetheless 

<b></b>

we remember him as "the English patient." The very precision of that label&#x02014;the man is English, he is patient&#x02014;finally produces vagueness, a cloud like the veil of black skin that encrusts the burned man.
</p>

<p>
How we read skin color, the multiple or singular valences of "race," is also a subject of this novel. In descriptions of the devastation of Hiroshima, human beings burned black recur; Caravaggio agrees with the suddenly-racialized, furious Sikh: "They would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation" (<i>EP</i>, 286). Up to this moment, disbelieving Caravaggio's word to the contrary, both Kip and Hana have clung to their delusions about the patient's identity&#x02014;"the man burned black. Who turned out to be, up close, an Englishman" (<i>EP</i>, 85). Both find odd comfort in their misreading, Hana because she cannot let go of the memory of her father, a Canadian soldier who died of his war burns, Kip because of his loyalty to his own substitute father, Lord Suffolk, who trained him in the dismantling of bombs. This touching imposition of his own text mutates into a tragic illiteracy when Kip, devastated by the ultimate devastation of a Bomb to end all bombs, can see only a white Englishman in the bed before him. Now the commonality of all texts, the community of cultures, is permanently desecrated: "[H]e had believed in the burned man and the civilisation he tended. Isaiah and Jeremiah and Solomon were in the burned man's bedside book, his holy book, whatever he had loved glued into his own. He had passed the book to the sapper, and the sapper had said we have a Holy Book too" (<i>EP</i>, 294). The tragedy is unspeakable: an Asian has risked his life daily, minutely, reading the landscape, for the English side; now that very side has created an unreadable bomb, an ultimate text: a "Let there be light" that destroys cultures. He "does not feel he can draw a match out of his bag and fire the lamp, for he believes the lamp will ignite everything" (<i>EP</i>, 294); he vilifies the man in the bed, and deserts from the British army.
</p>

<p>
Kip's inability to light a match in the darkness has its analogue in Alm&#x000E1;sy's final moments in the book, which are also the final moments of his life:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In the hallway by the English patient's bedroom the last candle burns, still alive in the night. Whenever he opens his eyes out of sleep, he sees the old wavering yellow light. 
<p class="blockquote">
	For him now the world is without sound, and even light seems an unneeded thing. 	He will tell the girl in the morning he wants no candle flame to accompany him while he sleeps. 
<p class="blockquote">
	[He feels and sees a ghostly presence at the foot of his bed.] 
<p class="blockquote">
	 . . . When the candle dies out he will be able to see this.  
<p class="blockquote">
	His hand reaches out slowly and touches his book and returns to his dark chest. Nothing else moves in the room.

</blockquote>

</div>

<p>
The ghostly presence is almost certainly Kip watching Alm&#x000E1;sy in the darkness; it is also, perhaps, Katharine, the now-dead woman he loved in Egypt; and it is Alm&#x000E1;sy's impending death. The loss of all light is the result of a light so immense, so terrible, that it obliterates in one flash thousands of individual flames.
</p>

<p>
The vignette of Alm&#x000E1;sy clutching his own book (by implication Ondaatje's book <i>is</i> Alm&#x000E1;sy's book; it is Alm&#x000E1;sy himself, a darkened text, endlessly readable) while the candle 

<b></b>

goes out, recalls a scene from a novel that attempted to grapple with the devastation of World War I. "Time Passes," the consciously crafted median passage of Virginia Woolf's <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, is divided into ten sections; the first begins in gathering darkness, with the imminent obliteration of the shoreline foreshadowing the imminent disaster of world war. Characters move into the house and turn out lights: "One by one the lamps were all extinguished, except that Mr. Carmichael, who liked to lie awake a little reading Virgil kept his candle burning rather longer than the rest."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  As readers know, the international catastrophe is mirrored by the domestic catastrophes of Prue and Mrs. Ramsay's deaths; the house stands empty for ten years, nearly falling into ruin, until, at the end of the chapter, most of the characters return. "[P]eace had come. . . . Mr. Carmichael read a book by candlelight."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The return of peace is mirrored within the household through the repetition of this vignette. And such repetitions and returns are hallmarks of modernism, which, in its dream of an ultimate harmony, trains readers to look for patterns within apparent disorder.
</p>

<p>
Some modernist writers sought harmony within a larger Order, tending toward fascism; others envisioned individual orders subject to constant rejuxtaposition and rearrangement. <i>The English Patient</i>, in its postmodern moment, carries over the latter ethos from modernism. Some argue, basing their response more on the film than the book, that it leans toward the former in its romanticization of a central re who is, when all is said and done, a spy for the Germans. But Alm&#x000E1;sy, despite his shady dealings, cannot be reduced to a villain; though he searches for origins, his mode of reading is nonhierarchical, juxtaposing the texts of different cultures rather than seeking to promote the primacy of one, and Kip was initially right to believe in the English patient's respect for all books. "All morning he and [his colleague] have worked in the archeological museum placing Arabic texts and European histories beside each other in an attempt to recognize echo, coincidence, name changes&#x02014;back past Herodotus to the <i>Kitab al Kanuz</i>, where Zerzura is named after the bathing woman in a desert caravan" (<i>EP</i>, 153). Though an originary moment is assumed, it is worth noting that Alm&#x000E1;sy's reading practise asserts&#x02014;paradoxically, perhaps, but humanistically in the deepest, <i>humane</i> sense&#x02014;the originality of both the colonized culture and of acts of translation among cultures. An echo of Pater can be found here; critics agree that Pater ultimately deprivileges ideas of origin. He asserts a comparative religious sensibility echoed by Alm&#x000E1;sy: "The basis of the reconciliation of all the religions of the world would . . . be the inexhaustible activity and creativeness of the human mind itself, in which all religions alike have their root" (<i>EP</i>, 22). Even love, in <i>The English Patient</i>, is a kind of textual juxtaposition; a couple of pages later, Katharine and Alm&#x000E1;sy are described, "their foreignness intimate like two pages of a closed book" (<i>EP</i>, 155).
</p>

<p>
In Alm&#x000E1;sy's final act of reading, <i>The English Patient</i> adapts the formal symmetry of Woolf's candlelight-reading scene to a post-apocalyptic world in which a single object can kill and maim thousands in a moment.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  "Time Passes" moves fairly smoothly between images of war and bloodshed and images of natural cataclysm&#x02014;storms at sea, the ravages of winter&#x02014;but <i>The English Patient</i> asserts again and again the incongruity of natural and manmade disasters. The flash of a bomb blast may resemble lightning, 

<b></b>

but the former indicates man's terrible manipulations of nature, not his harmony with, or even his mimesis of, the natural world. Unlike Mr. Carmichael, Alm&#x000E1;sy cannot continue reading when war has ended, since this war has ended with an event so terrible that even the act of lighting a match feels dangerous. Pompeii and Herculaneum are alluded to as prelapsarian tragedies, as is World War I, whose bombs and trenches seem minor compared to the Bomb. Truly, after Hiroshima and Nagasaki (and Auschwitz and Belsen), the act of reading is changed utterly.
</p>

<p>
This is easy to say, however; not so easy to represent, particularly when artistic creation, whether through brushstrokes or poetic language, cannot help but be an assertion of hope. As John Berger maintains, in the first essay of a collection ending with an article on the paintings of Hiroshima survivors, the aesthetic moment is always a vision of life. When the English patient's candle goes out, he will die; this is the difference between him and Carmichael. But <i>The English Patient</i> lives, and lives in the reader's mind in quintessentially modernist fashion, through its innumerable epiphanic moments. It is fitting that one of the main characters, and finally the novel's most astute reader, is named Caravaggio. Early in the book, when Hana is reunited with this uncle-re from her past, she remembers how, as a child in Toronto, "she learned to read the summer night" (<i>EP</i>, 49). "You used to be like those artists who painted only at night," she tells Caravaggio, "a single light on in their street. Like the worm-pickers with their old coffee cans strapped to their ankles and the helmet of light shooting down into the grass" (<i>EP</i>, 55). The hunt by flashlight not only represents Caravaggio's thieving talents but also emblematizes the reading activity of all the characters in the novel (the nurse, the archeologist/explorer and spy, the sapper), who must be alert to traces and signs that full light or a head-on gaze too easily obliterate. They must be alert to life in all its forms, even "ugly" ones, even those that are inert.

Such seeing represents both the end and the ends of the aestheticism first expounded by Walter Pater. After Hiroshima, "reading by candlelight" becomes impossible; it also becomes, given the surrounding darkness, the only way to read. As an activity, it is both amoral&#x02014;his insistence on a purely impressionistic criticism was Pater's revision of Ruskin's Christian moralism, and his inauguration of modernism&#x02014;and ultimately ethical. The work of Caravaggio (unmentioned in Pater's <i>Renaissance</i> but, one would think, a perfect case study for a late-Romantic/postmodern sequel to Pater) was distinguished by its realism. Like the four characters of <i>The English Patient</i>, who seem both individual to the point of eccentricity and archetypically larger-than-life, the saints in Caravaggio's paintings were rendered as real people. Caravaggio's work was also distinguished for its tenebrist method, whereby an oblique light illumines features and gestures within an engulfing darkness. Darkness sets the scene from the start of Ondaatje's novel, in which the characters find themselves in a bombed-out villa without electric light; nearly every page contains at least one tenebrist detail, and a concordance would almost certainly find "dark" the text's most frequent word, with "light" a close second. But here light always emerges <i>from</i>, never dispels, darkness. It is a highly visual, highly aestheticized, Paterian way of seeing, in which space matters more than time. Indeed time barely moves for the period in which the English patient 

<b></b>

lies simultaneously dying and apparently static within his carbonized skin. Everything that "happens" in the novel has happened already; the war has dropped a curtain over all, and with the exception of Kip, the shell-shocked characters are hardly aware of themselves continuing to live. Surrounded by trompe l'oeil walls and half broken statues, they feel like res on a fresco. Even Kip, after dismantling a bomb with Hana's help, "felt he was now within something, perhaps a painting he had seen somewhere in the last year" (<i>EP</i>, 104).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it is Kip, efficient, functional, superficially unscathed until the terrible moment when, out in the field, he hears the news of Hiroshima on his headphones, who functions as the novel's agent of a Paterian aestheticism and its measure of beauty's destruction. Kip, after all, is the character who most actively "appreciates" Italian art; Kip is the one who illumines, with his sapper's flare, the beautiful fresco of the Queen of Sheba. "Kip is my David," Alm&#x000E1;sy says, alluding to Caravaggio's <i>David with the Head of Goliath</i>; in his final fury, his act of desertion that precedes&#x02014;and possibly precipitates&#x02014;the death of the English patient, Kip eschews his former love of Western texts and images and asserts, albeit in a small way noticed by only a few individuals, the East's rebellion against imperial power and culture. In his very repudiation of a Western visual ethos, however, Kip apotheosizes the ethics of reading by candlelight: a reading that is finally, and fundamentally, a <i>looking</i>, and which therefore notes the value, the inherent life, of what is missed in bright light. Or, to put it slightly differently, "[o]ne of evil's principal modes of being is <i>looking beyond</i> (with indifference) that which is before the eyes."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Kip refuses to continue looking beyond.
</p>

<p>
Kip realizes that he has read so busily, he has missed the significance of each individual bomb; has failed to recognize the monstrous Bomb implicit in each small one. Hiroshima functions as a terrible epiphany that temporarily blinds him; the very character who is noted early on for his fastidious reading tastes ("[h]e turned away from mystery books with irritation, able to pinpoint villains with too much ease" [<i>EP</i>, 112]) pinpoints the burned patient as English, and a villain. We do not know whether he revises this reading, but we know that he becomes a doctor, not a soldier or a terrorist (people's potential to set, but also to <i>be</i>, bombs is suggested time and again through the novel's system of imagery). This vocation spiritually returns him to Hana, whom he had loved in the villa those many years ago. The particular moment that recalls her to him years later&#x02014;treating a chemical burn on the arm of a girl (<i>EP</i>, 300)&#x02014;can also recall to us, the readers, a moment easily overlooked, an abuse forgotten.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  It elucidates the moral end<i>s </i>of aestheticism. John Berger, the marxist art critic who has spent a life cultivating the art of looking, enjoins readers not to dismiss events like Hiroshima even as we decry individual acts of terrorism across the globe; make no mistake, he says, this was a monstrous act of terrorism. Writing to her mother after Kip has left, Hana says, <i>"One day after we heard the bombs were dropped in Japan, so it feels like the end of the world. . . . If we can rationalize this we can rationalize anything"</i> (<i>EP</i>, 292; italics in original).
</p>

<p>
If we read as Berger enjoins us to, looking <i>at</i> rather than looking <i>past</i>, the burned arm of Kip's patient asks for our gaze. That it is a chemical burn suggests the girl is a victim 

<b></b>

of neo-colonialist abuses, reminding us of the chain of connections in the novel between Caravaggio's lopped thumbs (chopped off by the Germans), the patient's burned body, the death of Patrick, Hana's father, Hana's own traumatized condition&#x02014;and a small girl mentioned in an almost offhand way in one of Alm&#x000E1;sy's stories of desert exploration: "I looked around [another explorer's] tent. . . . As I was leaving I saw a mirror tacked up high against the skin wall, and looking at it I saw the reflection of the bed. There seemed to be a small lump, a dog possibly, under the covers. I pulled back the <i>djellaba</i> and there was a small Arab girl tied up, sleeping there" (<i>EP</i>, 138). Though Alm&#x000E1;sy's telling sounds indifferent, the text asks us to look at tethering as an abuse of culture; it enjoins our alertness to the overlookable instance, fragment, gesture, expression, that indicates a larger history. It is this form of looking I've called, for the purposes of this discussion, "reading by candlelight." It suggests the work to be done if the world is to be kept from total darkness.

W. G. Sebald: Less Light
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Total darkness as a result of blinding light pervades the fictions of W. G. Sebald, whose atmosphere is always post-apocalyptic, and decidedly post-Enlightenment.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  He seems to reverse Goethe's legendary deathbed outcry and say "Less light": both as a remark on his own blinded vision, and as a comment on humanity's obsession with illumination, which leads, in his view inevitably, to apocalyptic fires and firestorms:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Our spread over the earth was fuelled by reducing the higher species of vegetation to charcoal, by incessantly burning whatever would burn. . . . From the earliest times, human civilization has been no more than a strange luminescence growing more intense by the hour of which no one can say when it will begin to wane and when it will fade away. For the time being, our cities still shine through the night, and the fires still spread.

<p class="noIndent">
Yet even as Sebald's stance is doggedly, clear-sightedly anti-redemptive, he, too, seeks the Caravaggiesque detail that might, by illuming suffering, help eradicate it. Sebald's narrator describes himself, time and again, as seeing the world from behind a dark veil or curtain. He suffers from eye trouble; he links himself implicitly, in his prose poem "As the Snow on the Alps" (from the trilogy of prose poems called <i>After Nature</i>), to the sixteenth century painter Matthias Gr&#x000FC;newald, who "wore/a dark bandage over his face" in sympathy with massacred peasants whose eyes were gouged out by soldiers. This image of the blindfolded painter who embodies the suffering others look away from, who represents it, and whose re-presentations are available to those who do not allow themselves to be blinded by what Mieke Bal calls "the official story," who are willing to look and to discern, is emblematic for Sebald's ethics and his aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
Like Pater's and Ondaatje's, Sebald's aesthetics&#x02014;his view of the art of painting, and his own painterly sensibility&#x02014;is born from darkness and death and pervaded by the idea of a committed but unprejudiced <i>looking</i>. The mysterious photographs with which his writings are riddled tend to be blurry, illegible, and overlookable; often they have no 

<b></b>

obvious relation to the text itself. He favors, both morally and aesthetically, the oblique view and the detail over the panorama. Like Kip the sapper, who learns that brief attention to a different text will help him read the location of a mine, Sebald imposes distraction on the act of reading. Not only are his narratives filled with deviations, they positively <i>consist</i> of deviations. He can switch focus quite suddenly, only to wrench the reader's attention back to an earlier subject and compel us to recognize connections we might otherwise have overlooked. These connections, too, are both aesthetic and moral, so that a book like <i>The Rings of Saturn</i> manages astonishingly to weave the history of silk cultivation into European and Far Eastern history in such a way that human artistic achievement, the conquest of nature, and human atrocity all are brought together with one thread, as it were, of silken fabric. Another example is the history of sugar, whose production and trade are inextricably bound both to artistic production and to slavery: in short, to cultivation of the highest spiritual sensibilities and of the lowest colonialist-materialist impulses, and of the cultural institutions and landmarks spawned by each. In a bar in Southwold, Sebald meets a Dutchman who remarks on
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
the curiously close relationship that existed, until well into the twentieth century, between the history of sugar and the history of art. . . . [He] drew my attention to the fact that many important museums, such as the Mauritshuis in The Hague or the Tate Gallery in London, were originally endowed by the sugar dynasties or were in some other way connected with the sugar trade. The capital amassed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries through various forms of slave economy is still in circulation . . . still bearing interest, increasing many times over and continually burgeoning anew.

Again and again, Sebald's narrators make connections such as these, teaching the reader, in the process, to look for the ends of the thread binding the beautiful to the sinister.
</p>

<p>
"Sinister," as it happens, is one of Pater's pet words, and alludes to the left hand as well as to suspect persons or ideas. Where Pater rescues the idea of the sinister for a liberationist aesthetics, as in the above-cited description of Leonardo's John the Baptist, recent writers on art see the sinister hand pointing to more disturbing underground energies. Mieke Bal's feminist-ethical rereading of Rembrandt includes, as a significant motif, the idea of the "speaking hand": the painted hand that is "indexical, signaling" (<i>RR</i>, 46). In the works Bal examines, this hand is often that of a woman indicating her violation, or attempted violation, by a particular man or men. In Pater, as we have seen, the hand tends to articulate that which dare not speak its name: oblique inclinations, sinister tendencies. In Sebald's rereading of European civilization as a history of mostly human-inflicted catastrophes, it is the hand of a criminal anatomically dissected in Rembrandt's painting <i>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</i> , that points out criminality in supposedly proper places. (This is a painting that Bal also, not incidentally, investigates.) The cadaver's hand indicts the omissions and blind spots of Enlightenment thinking. In his interrogation of that painting, Sebald discovers something sinister: the dissected left hand of the corpse is turned the wrong way around and, rather than representing the hand as it would have been, is in essence copied from the anatomy textbook the assembled doctors are consulting:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[W]hat we are faced with is a transposition taken from the anatomical atlas, <i>evidently without further reflection</i>, that turns this otherwise true-to-life painting . . . into a crass misrepresentation at the exact centre point of its meaning, where the incisions are made . . . It is with him, the victim . . . that the painter identifies. His gaze alone is free of Cartesian rigidity. He alone sees that greenish annihilated body, and he alone sees the shadow in the half-open mouth and over the dead man's eyes.

<p>
The faithful Sebald reader will recognize this as a classic Sebaldian epiphany, in which all the motifs, reference points, and essential strivings of his work seem tied together. There is the sudden view through the fog of habitual looking (one of Pater's bugbears), of "the official story" so often attached by art historians to canonical images. There is also the exposure of culpability in high places; not culpability merely, but collusion with the very values the system claims to reject and condemn, in this case the almost medieval maltreatment or scapegoating of a human body in a theatrical scenario staged precisely to claim the authority of science and reason. There is what critic Michael Rothberg calls the "traumatic index," a kind of metonymic pointing, in this case through the painted re's hand, toward a prior trauma.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  There is the vision of a <i>twisting</i> of the body, which occurs frequently in Sebald's work and recalls the memorable etymological linkage between torture and <i>torquere</i> (to twist) in the essay "Torture" by one of Sebald's favorite writers, Jean Am&#x000E9;ry.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Such twistings, in Sebald, are emblematic of a culture that functions ultimately, even at its most high-minded moments, through the exercise of force. There is the placement of the heart of the matter off center, the deflection of the viewer's gaze from the obvious to the apparently oblique.
</p>

<p>
Although there is no specifically Jewish content to this particular painting or its analysis, the Holocaust is never out of the picture; in fact, it is always indicated <i>by</i> the picture. Sebald is too subtle a writer to make the connections explicit, but they are there, and his work is so studded with them that the reader learns to recognize even the buried suggestions of analogy&#x02014;here, for instance, the analogy between the activity of the seventeenth-century doctors and that of medical experimentation under the Nazi regime. Sebald the pessimistic essayist is the author of the last chapter in a modernism begun with Pater's celebration of gleams in the darkness. A sense of "post," of beginning from darkness and death, informed modernism from the start, so that "postmodernism" itself is something of an oxymoron, unless one considers it to be so fully infused by dark vision that it carries modernism to its end point. In his epiphanies, Sebald is Paterian through and through; a passage in his final novel, <i>Austerlitz</i>, seems virtually lifted out of Pater's conclusion:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The trails of light which [the moths] seemed to leave behind them in all kinds of curlicues and streamers and spirals . . . did not really exist . . . but were merely phantom traces created by the sluggish reaction of the human eye, appearing to see a certain afterglow in the place from which the insect itself, shining for only the fraction of a second in the lamplight, had already gone. It was such unreal phenomena . . . the sudden incursion of unreality into the real world, certain effects of light in the landscape spread before us, or in the eye of a beloved person, that kindled our deepest feelings, or at least what we took for them.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As in Pater, the gleam vanishes almost as soon as it has been perceived; as in Pater, the attempt to distinguish such "incursions," in art, the landscape, and a loved person's features, is paramount. But Sebald, born in 1944, inheritor of a weight of national guilt, outdoes Pater for skepticism: "<i>or at least what we took for them</i>." Can we believe in the reality of what we loved when it was so easily extinguished? Not for Sebald a consoling image like that of snail shells glowing to illume Hana's birthday in 1945; instead of small light counterpointing darkness, darkness itself becomes the new form of inscription. As with the contemporary German artist Anselm Kiefer, known particularly for his ashen landscapes alluding to the ravages of the Third Reich, shades of gray pervade the work of Sebald, and erasure, uncovering, becomes an act of making-darker rather than enlightenment. Thus the refugee painter Max Ferber in Sebald's <i>The Emigrants</i> creates images through a progressive rubbing-out of charcoal. No wonder, when what the Nazis favored was light&#x02014;more light, always&#x02014;and in so doing, created an engulfing darkness. "The construction of hells on earth was accompanied in Europe by plans for heavens on earth," writes John Berger, meaning that the death camps were intended to lead to utopia.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Sebald describes such visions of heaven in <i>The Rings of Saturn</i> in his final chapter on the history of silk:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[The nineteenth-century Bavarian] Counsellor Hazzi's vision of a nation united by sericulture and educating itself toward higher ends went unheeded, doubtless because the previous failures lay in the too recent past. However, after an interval of a hundred years it was revived by the German fascists with that peculiar thoroughness they brought to everything they touched, as I realized with some surprise when, last summer, searching in the education office of the town I grew up in for the short documentary about North Sea herring fisheries which had been shown to us in primary school, I happened upon a film on German silk cultivation, evidently made for the same series. In contrast to the dark, almost midnight tonalities of the herring film, the film on sericulture was of a truly dazzling brightness. Men and women in white coats, in whitewashed rooms flooded with light, were busy at snow-white spinning frames, snow-white sheets of paper, snow-white protective gauze, snow-white cocoons and snow-white canvas mailing sacks. The whole film promised the best and cleanest of all possible worlds, an impression that was confirmed when I read the accompanying booklet, which was intended for our teachers. Citing the F&#x000FC;hrer's pronouncement, at the 1936 party rally, that Germany must become self-sufficient within four years in all the materials it lay in the nation's power to produce itself, the author of the booklet observed that this is self-evidently silk cultivation.

<p>
Between the film on phosphorescent herring and the blinding film on sericulture, both produced by the same company&#x02014;the same culture&#x02014;lies the historical gap between Paterian luminescence and Sebaldian grayness. If light can come to this&#x02014;genocide, Hiroshima (whose survivors remembered the infamous white flash of light at the moment of catastrophe)&#x02014;then better choose gray, the in-between, after the century of white nights. And indeed, modernist aestheticism has always inhabited a twilight, a recognition that ultimate light is neither achievable nor desirable; it remains to see whether that twilight produces a new Renaissance&#x02014;Pater's fantasy&#x02014;or merely illuminates, as on a movie screen, the mistakes humanity continues to make.

On 24 April 1915, T. S. Eliot wrote to his cousin Eleanor Hinkley from Merton College, Oxford, where he was at that time a student. He reported that, as a diversion from his studies, he had been "to a few music-halls, and to the cinema with a most amusing French woman who is the only interesting acquaintance at my boarding house."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The point of this latter expedition was presumably the amusing French woman, rather than the cinema. Of her, alas, we hear no more. But there is sufficient scattered reference to the cinema, in Eliot's letters, essays, and poems, to suggest an enduring preoccupation, and one with definite consequences for his development as a writer.

<p>
The recent intensification of interest in literary modernism's relation to cinema, on the one hand, and Eliot's relation to popular culture, on the other, has created a curious blind spot. Enthusiasts for cinema's formative effect on modernist writing have on the whole felt that there is little or nothing to be done with Eliot; while critics who place great emphasis on Eliot's endorsement of popular forms such as music hall argue that it strengthened yet further his already powerful "aversion to cinema."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  On both sides, the tendency has been to quote his remarks about cinema at their most dismissive, and in isolation.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Eliot has been cast as the mandarin high modernist who remained, in this one respect at least, a mandarin high modernist. I shall argue that, contrary to common belief, he does not fit the part.

Modernism and Cinema

<p class="noIndent">
In recent years, cinema has been proposed as a context for the work of an increasing number of writers who published in 

<b></b>

the period between the two World Wars, and whom we now regard as modernist.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The great majority of the enquiries into literary modernism's relation to cinema undertaken during the past thirty years or so have been committed, implicitly or explicitly, to argument by analogy. The literary text, we are told, is <i>structured like a film</i>, in whole or in part: it has its "close-ups," its "tracks" and "pans," its "cuts" from one "shot" to another. Writers and film-makers were engaged, it would seem, in some kind of exchange of transferable narrative techniques. The transferable narrative technique which has featured most consistently in debates about literary modernism is montage. Michael Wood, indeed, argues that the "principle of montage," together with the "construction of imaginary space through the direction of the gaze," is "quintessentially modernist."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  It is a principle active, for example, according to an already voluminous scholarship, throughout the work of James Joyce.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  <i>The Waste Land</i> has recently been described as the "modern montage poem par excellence" (<i>CM</i>, 40).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There has always been an advantage in thinking of the modernist text as though it were a film structured by the principle of montage. Louis MacNeice, for example, remembered encountering Eliot's poems for the first time in 1926, when he was in his final year in high school: "we had seen reviews proclaiming him a modern of the moderns and we too wanted to be 'modern.'" To someone his age, MacNeice recalled, <i>The Waste Land</i>'s literary allusions and "anthropological symbolism" meant nothing. What did help was going to the movies. "The cinema technique of quick cutting, of surprise juxtapositions, of spotting the everyday detail and making it significant, this would naturally intrigue the novelty-mad adolescent and should, like even the most experimental films, soon become easy to grasp."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  MacNeice's recollection may be entirely faithful to his own experience of <i>The Waste Land</i>, and sound advice to boot, and yet not tell us anything at all about how the poem came to be written as it was written. For what the novelty-mad adolescent knew about film technique, in 1926, was already a world away from what the poem's author might or might not have known when he wrote it. Experimental cinema&#x02014;a cinema of "surprise juxtapositions"&#x02014;only arrived in Britain with the founding of the London Film Society in 1925.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Historically, the term "montage" acquired in a short period of time a range of not always entirely compatible meanings.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  For the most part, it came to be understood as referring either to the combination of two shots in such a way as to generate an effect or meaning not discernible in either shot alone, or to the sort of conceptual or rhythmical cutting associated in particular with Sergei Eisenstein. P. Adams Sitney identifies reverse angle cutting as the "montage formula" which by the end of World War I had become the basis of narrative continuity in cinema. <i>Modernist</i> montage arose out of the reinvigoration of this formula through "playful hyperbole" and other means in films made from the mid-1920s onwards.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Michael North's meticulous survey of small magazines has made it clear that the intellectual prestige of the movies, and thus of montage as transferable narrative technique, peaked during the late 1920s, when Eugene Jolas's <i>transition</i> found room for various experiments in "logocinema."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Whatever its virtues, no account of modernist montage along these lines can tell us how and why works of literature conceived during the previous decade, works such as 

<b></b>

<i>Ulysses</i> and 
<i>The Waste Land,</i> came to be written as they were written. Any account of the literary use to which a writer may or may not have put a cinematic device must be based on an understanding of the uses to which that device was put, at the time of writing, in cinema. To the best of my knowledge, that condition has not yet been met, where <i>The Waste Land</i> and <i>Ulysses</i> are concerned.
</p>

<p>
In examining the relation between early cinema and Eliot's poems up to and including <i>The Waste Land</i>, I propose to substitute for the model of an exchange of transferable techniques (Sitney believes that the film-makers learned as much from the writers as the writers did from the film-makers) the model of parallelism. In my view, the literature of the period and the cinema of the period can best be understood as constituting and constituted by parallel histories.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Some early film-makers shared with some writers of the period a feeling both that new forms and techniques had made it possible for the first time to represent <i>existence as such</i>, and that the superabundant generative power of those forms and techniques (their ever-imminent autonomy) put in doubt the very idea of existence as such. The ground of this common preoccupation, then, was technology, and the automatisms of mind and matter technology might be thought to have enforced. "For the first time," Andr&#x000E9; Bazin remarked of the photographic image, "between the originating object and its reproduction there intervenes only the instrumentality of a nonliving agent."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  When modernist writers thought of cinema, they thought, above all, of an image of the world formed automatically. Film, Marianne Moore observed in 1933, "like the lie detector of the criminal court, reveals agitation which the eye fails to see."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  By seeing as the human eye does not see, film became a meta-technology: a medium whose constant subject-matter was the limits of the human.
</p>

<p>
Modernism has generally been understood, in recent scholarship, as a peculiar openness to modernity at its most enabling (and most fearsome).<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Thus Hugh Kenner argues that the affinity Eliot and many of his contemporaries felt with technological change had profound consequences for their writing. "If Eliot is much else," Kenner notes, "he is undeniably his time's chief poet of the alarm clock, the furnished flat, the ubiquitous telephone, commuting crowds, the electric underground railway." There is even a hint at cinema. The "hooded hordes" which swarm over endless plains, in the final section of <i>The Waste Land</i>, stumbling in the cracked earth, "may," Kenner adds, "have been literal impressions of World War I newsreels."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  For Eliot was the poet not only of the new machines, but of the new mechanical behavior to which their dominance could be thought to have given rise.

<p class="noIndent">
However, to be the poet of the alarm clock and the commuter meant writing poems which partook in some measure of the automatism which was their topic: poems which knew what it felt like to behave, and perhaps even to want to behave, as if automatized. "Portrait of a Lady" enlists the reader in just such an exercise: "You have the scene

arrange itself&#x02014;as it will seem to do . . . " (<i>CPP</i>, 18). The scene's seeming self-arrangement: that, perhaps, is where cinema came in.

<p>
Garrett Stewart has recently offered an admirably challenging description of modernist literature's affinity with cinema which promises to move the whole debate decisively beyond argument by analogy, in the direction of the idea of parallel histories. Stewart brings a reading of literary experiment to bear on a reading of film in order to clarify the "special kind of newness" accruing to photographic imprint in its "deliberately unrecognizable form of motorized disappearance." His emphasis is on the "shared modernist strain, in every sense, of literary and filmic textuality": on the "photogrammatic track" as the "underlying stuff of the apparition"; and on writing as <i>&#x000E9;criture</i>, as text in production. The "filmic," Stewart proposes, stands to the "cinematic" as <i>&#x000E9;criture</i> to "classic narrative"; one is modernist, the other merely modern. "Narrative cinema as film, literature as denaturalized language: these then are the modernist reductions that affiliate textualities beneath the contest of media."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Stewart's insistence on textuality has reanimated the post-structuralist readings of Eliot, Pound, Joyce and others prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s. To think in terms of photographic imprint or "photogrammatic" track is to think once again in terms of what Maud Ellmann has called a "poetics of impersonality." "As poets," Ellmann says of Eliot and Pound, "both efface themselves through masks, personae, and ventriloquy, and the polylogue within their texts impugns the self's domain."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  To what extent, Stewart invites us to ask, did the modernist polylogue run on "motorized disappearance"?
</p>

<p>
Stewart draws productively on Frederic Jameson's description of the "confluence," in a passage from E. M. Forster's <i>Howards End</i> , "of movie technology on the one hand, and of a certain type of modernist or protomodernist language on the other," both of which seem to offer some space, some "third term," between the subject and the object of perception.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  For Jameson, Stewart observes, that third term is in effect the (literary/photographic) apparatus, the "disembodiment of perception by technique"; automatism, in short. "Modernist writing is neither predominantly impressionist nor expressive (since both imply the intervening subjectivity of an author) but in some new way strictly technical, a prosthesis of observation in the mode of inscription." What Stewart discerns in <i>Howards End</i>, and then in an enhanced form in <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, is "an <i>automatism</i> of language beneath the intentionalities of inscription." There was, he claims, a "cultural commonality" between "automated image projection" and "the depersonalized verbal techniques of a modernist stylistic 'apparatus'" (<i>BFS</i>, 281, 283, 285).
</p>

<p>
Stewart's broad "textualist theory" of the "adjacent inscriptive media of film and literature" strikes me as consistently illuminating. Since the argument turns on adjacency alone, rather than a conjuncture more often asserted than proven, he is able, as the proponents of montage as transferable narrative technique are not, to read each medium closely, and often to brilliant effect, in terms appropriate to its specific "textuality." The argument may, however, require further refinement if it is to be brought to bear on Eliot's poetics of impersonality.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, Stewart identifies modernist style exclusively with a certain "signifying over and above the signified": that is, with verbal drift, or skid, with phonemic 

<b></b>

"congealment" and "knotted lexicality" (the latter in regard to a poem by Emily Dickinson) (<i>BFS</i>, 266, 286, 284, 288). Modernist style, however, has various dimensions. Eliot's poetry does not lack for polylogue, of course; but it may be that he found his enabling automatism in prosody, say, rather than in lexis. For Eliot, regular meter and rhyme were neither an encumbrance nor an expressive support, but precisely a frame, a "prosthesis of observation"; as they had been for Dickinson. The test I have proposed for myself is that an account of the consequences of a writer's knowledge of cinema should illuminate the literary text <i>strictly as a literary text</i>. It should explain how and why a poem came to take, as a whole or in part, the shape it took. Such an explanation could not legitimately restrict itself to an aspect of literary language.
</p>

<p>
In the second place, Stewart's preference for "film" over "cinema" has the effect of sharpening yet further the distinction between "high" and "low" culture which recent scholarship has done so much to complicate. Like Sitney, Wood, and others, Stewart confines his analysis to films based on the "systematic multiplicaton of shots through editing": that is, French and Russian experimental cinema of the 1920s, and the "modernist valedictions" of the 1960s and 1970s (<i>BFS</i>, 311, 282, 293). The analysis itself is highly informative. Eliot, however, was a good deal more interested in cinema, as Stewart defines it, than he was in film. The genres which most exercised his imagination&#x02014;the Western; slapstick comedy&#x02014;were all in the mainstream; indeed, they <i>were</i> the mainstream. The study of literary modernism in relation to early cinema has not always benefited from an exclusive emphasis on avant-garde film-making.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A third and final cause of disquiet, with regard to Stewart's approach, is that the combination of high theory and techno-determinism which sustains it may have succeeded in obliterating agency altogether. In Forster, Conrad, and Joyce, Stewart argues, the "mechanisms of linguistic articulation" have been "brought forward" as the "suppressed material basis (phonemic even when not phonic or oral) of all lexical processing" (<i>BFS</i>, 286). But brought forward <i>how</i>? By whom? And why, at this particular moment in history? If we are to find terms for agency, in modernism's encounter with technology, we need to conceive technological developments not as a matrix, or condition, but as always already subjectified, caught up in feeling.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  It is with the "intentionality of film's automatisms," Stanley Cavell has argued, that critical understanding should begin.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot <i>chose</i>, in certain texts, or in certain episodes or scenes, the "disembodiment of perception by technique." He did so, I shall argue, because he intended his poems to reveal what it felt like to (want to) behave automatically. The poems are at once an enactment and a critique of the will-to-automatism animating the pleasures and the psychopathologies of everyday modern life. Modernism was not the product of a machine age. It was (among many other things) a wilful enquiry into the age's wilful absorption in the kinds of automatic behavior exemplified by machinery in general. "But, of course," as Eliot himself observed in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" , "only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The aim of this essay is to establish that our understanding of Eliot's "poetics of impersonality" will be enhanced by a definition of its informing will-to-automatism which takes full account, for the first time, of his commentary on cinema. The parallel 

<b></b>

histories in play, here, are those of the development of Eliot's poetry up to and including <i>The Waste Land</i> , and of the emergence during the same period of a fully narrative cinema (that is, of character-driven story films capable of absorbing a diverse mass audience into a self-sufficient world unified across space and time). In my view, the only way to establish the relation between those histories is through an examination of Eliot's evolving commentary, in poems, essays, and letters, on cinema. Eliot did not write cinematically. But there is a history to his changing view of the medium which can usefully be compared to the history of the ways in which the medium itself changed, during the silent era, as well as to the history of his own attempts to change literature.

Cinema appears first in the poems, rather than in letters or essays; and it appears by way of a shared terminology of the screen, and of images that flicker on the screen. The view these poems propose is of consciousness as a space, or event, or drama, of projection. Thoughts or feelings can only be known as they hang in the distance between an internal source of illumination and a conred surface belonging to the world outside. They can only be known technologically.
</p>

<p>
Or so "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," Eliot's hall-mark early poem, completed in the summer of 1911, would have us believe. As the poem begins, a question arises, or might arise, during the course of an urban expedition the speaker means to undertake (has already undertaken?) with a nameless (probably male) companion. To pose the question directly would be to be overwhelmed by it.

Prufrock's prim rhyme nips curiosity in the bud. The visit, coming quick and tart upon the companion's (possible) question about a question, meets it, in sound if not in sense, before it has fully arisen; and so prevents, or postpones, the damage its arising might do. The visit, of a kind Eliot himself had made often enough as an undergraduate at Harvard, is (or would be) to a room where women come and go, where there is music, and tea, and cakes and ices.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Prufrock, it has often been said, behaves, or imagines himself behaving, as though he were in a story by Henry James: "Crapy Cornelia," whose protagonist strikingly fails, under comparable circumstances, to propose to the woman of his dreams.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The purpose of the visit is to relieve him, through ordeal by embarrassment, of any remaining thought of an overwhelming question. For the one person who cannot be admitted, who will never make his presence felt there, is the person Prufrock would have to be if he were to pose the question: a prophet, Lazarus come from the dead.
</p>

<p>
The space Prufrock at once anticipates and remembers entering is a space of pure specularity. "Prufrock," Ellmann notes, "sees himself <i>being seen</i>." He sees the bald spot 

<b></b>

on his head as it might appear from the point of view of the women who have gathered at the top of the stair to observe an ungracious departure. He has been estranged, Ellmann adds, by the eyes which "fix" him in a "formulated phrase," to the exteriorities of language and space (<i>PI</i>, 69). Does he even show up? "He is not there yet when we hear him speaking," Hugh Kenner observes: "he will never be there, or will perpetually return there&#x02014;it does not matter." He will never be there as the person he would like to be, Lazarus come from the dead; but he will always be there, in his own absence, through memory and anticipation. He may consider defying whatever "automatism" propels him repeatedly, in memory or in anticipation, "through these streets, through that door, up those stairs."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  But he needs it more than it needs him.
</p>

<p>
The trouble is that the automatism does not work; or does not work as Prufrock would like it to work, for all the embarrassment it causes him, as a shield against overwhelming questions. For this visit undertaken automatically poses a question even more overwhelming, in its sheer immediacy, than anything that might have arisen on an expedition through argumentative streets. The question is sexual arousal, and the sense of self it generates, on the spot, at the time (<i>which</i> time no longer matters). Prufrock has been, or will be, or let us risk saying is, aroused by the arms of the women who come and go:
</p>

What finally puts him at the scene, in the picture, is his attention to bodily texture: the film of light brown hair on a white arm. In describing the body, Victorian writers had for the most part confined themselves to that which was most expressive about it: its overall shape; or its most characterful component, the face; or a particular feature (eyes, nose, mouth). Edwardian writers chose instead to describe the flesh between features. The focus of the new eroticism in literature was on the body as body, rather than as an expression of soul. The down on a woman's body looms large as a provocation to and emblem of male desire in novels by Arnold Bennett, D. H. Lawrence, May Sinclair and others.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The story Prufrock now finds himself in is a story by Bennett or Lawrence, rather than by Henry James. Eliot had brought himself bang up to date.
</p>

<p>
The intensity of Prufrock's arousal produces or is produced by an intensification in the verse. By comparison with its sparse and evenly paced predecessor ("and white and bare"), the line describing the hair on the women's arms seems positively swollen: the echo of "lamplight" in "light brown hair" and the internal rhyme on "downed" and "brown" fill it from within with sameness of sound, with emphasis. In this moment of absolute fixation, the poem dwells on the inexpressive body, and also on that in its own formal procedures which foreshadows and outlasts expression: on technique, on poetic matter. It is characteristic of Eliot, however, that he should have embedded the moment of absolute fixation in a parenthesis. The ear hears the conjoining rhyme, the eye sees the disjoining brackets. So Prufrock's arousal is at once overwhelming and ghostly. He must be reckoned most fully present only when absent. The automatism 

<b></b>

propelling him, in memory or in anticipation, through that door, up those stairs, observes as he would not actually have observed, had he been there himself, in his own person, with an overwhelming question to hand. The couplet describing what the prosthesis or automatism has seen or will see in his place exemplifies the disembodiment of perception by technique.
</p>

<p>
The circle of illumination within which the light brown hair on a white arm appears in alluring close-up might make us think of the cinema. Such close-ups of the body's less expressive stretches played in an important part in some of the earliest narrative films. G. A. Smith's <i>As Seen through a Telescope</i>  begins with a long shot of an elderly man brandishing a telescope, while a woman and a younger man wheeling a bicycle advance up the street towards him. As the telescope settles on the pair, Smith cuts to a medium close-up of the woman's foot resting on a pedal, isolated within a circular vignette. The young man has knelt down to tie her shoelace. She gradually raises her skirt, revealing an expanse of stockinged ankle and leg, which her companion proceeds to caress. As the long shot resumes, the elderly voyeur seats himself contentedly, at the peep-show's conclusion, only to receive a punitive cuff from the young man, who has caught him looking, as the couple pass. By severing foreground from background, the close-up induces a change of medium rather than scale, a metamorphosis. The expanse of ankle and leg on display is an object as much of touch as of sight. Like Prufrock, the elderly man has been made present (has been presented to desire, has shown up) in and through his absence, in and through a prosthesis. The erotic effect of Smith's film lies in what visual technologies see that the human eye cannot; that of Eliot's poem in what poetic technique renders that other forms of representation cannot.
</p>

<p>
"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" is indeed a love song: the love song of a voyeur equipped with a telescope, or a movie camera, or a page or two in a modern novel. Once body-hair has posed its overwhelming question, there is no way back, for Prufrock. He cannot undo the knowledge his automatism has given him. What remains is to make sense of experience: whether the experience has been of sunsets, and sprinkled streets, or of novels, teacups, and trailing skirts. After all this, Prufrock laments, and so much more,

Walter Benjamin was to seize eagerly on Baudelaire's description of the person routinely suffering the shocks and strains of modern urban experience as a "<i>kaleidoscope</i> 

<b></b>

equipped with consciousness." Light pours into a kaleidoscope pressed up against the eye from outside, from the world beyond. Benjamin took from Baudelaire's re its preoccupation with passivity. He imagines a pedestrian forever on the alert for traffic signals, for the cautionary light shone at him or her through pieces of colored glass. "Thus technology," he concludes, "has subjected the human sensorium to a complex kind of training." Cinema, in which "perception in the form of shocks" has been established as a "formal principle," would complete the training.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  One could say that Eliot's re presents the modern man or woman as a magic lantern equipped with consciousness. His interest in technology does not, however, entail a comparable techno-determinism.
</p>

<p>
The magic lantern's light source is internal rather than external. A beam of light, shone through hand-painted or photographic glass slides, takes shape on the screen positioned in front of and at a certain distance from the projector. Two aspects of Eliot's development of the magic lantern as a re for the way the mind works are worth noting. First, he stresses the force of projection: the image <i>thrown</i> onto or against the screen. There can be no doubting the power of the mind's internal light source. Eliot's magic lantern has been equipped with a rather more active consciousness than Baudelaire's kaleidoscope. Secondly, the nerves thrown violently onto the screen have at least been thrown onto it in a pattern. The shape the beam of light has taken is intelligible. The patterned image solicits interpretation. It might even amount to what Eliot was to call in his 1919 essay on <i>Hamlet</i> the "objective correlative" or "formula" for a particular emotion.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In this respect, the history of the magic lantern, a mainstay of the Victorian entertainment industry, and one of cinema's most significant precursors, can help to explain Eliot's emphasis. Some features of lantern showmanship, such as musical accompaniment, and the commentary provided by a narrator or lecturer, carried over into early film presentation.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  It seems likely that, given the presence of a narrator or lecturer, the relationship the magic lantern spectator maintained with the images on the screen was, as No&#x000EB;l Burch puts it, "an <i>exploratory</i> one"; a relationship also characteristic of the first film shows.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The magic lantern co-existed with the moving pictures for a decade or more after 1895. So Eliot's reference to it, in 1911, was slightly archaic; and no doubt with intent. Prufrock finds himself in the predicament Eliot was to describe in "The Dry Salvages" (<i>CPP</i>, 186). He has had the experience (of sunsets and sprinkled streets, of novels, teacups, and trailing skirts), but missed the meaning. The magic lantern&#x02014;the kind of technology, genteel and old-fashioned, with which Prufrock feels at home&#x02014;intervenes. It cannot restore meaning to experience. But its automatism has created a pattern, there, on the screen, for exploration, which Prufrock alone would have been incapable of creating.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that Prufrock is rather too much at home with his old-fashioned technology. His vision of mermaids riding the waves, or lolling in sea-weed drapes in chambers beneath it, has something of the magic-lantern show about it. Perhaps Prufrock had been to see (Eliot himself could not possibly have done) the dances presented at the Palace Theater by a lady calling herself La Pia. The performance, we learn from a 

<b></b>

report in the <i>Times</i>, is "considerably heightened by a shimmering background of glistening tinsel ribbons and the artful aid of many-coloured lights in combination with clever cinematograph and magic lantern illusions." Two of La Pia's dances apparently brought the "opposing elements" of fire and water into play with "quite extraordinary realism." In the fire dance, drapery and streaming hair sucked by a "furious draught" coalescence into flame. In the water dance, a cinematograph turns the whole of the back of the stage into a tossing sea.

The third of the "Preludes," dated July 1911, describes a woman who, dozing, watches the night reveal the sordid images of which her soul is constituted "flicker" against the ceiling (<i>CPP</i>, 23). When Prufrock wistfully remarks that he has seen the moment of his greatness "flicker" (<i>CPP</i>, 15), the flickering is that of a candle, or lamp. Here, by contrast, it is the images which flicker, not a light source; the flickering is mechanical. The <i>OED</i>'s first citation for "flicker" in its cinematic sense&#x02014;a succession of changes in a picture occurring when the number of frames per second is too small to produce reliable persistence of vision&#x02014;is from H. V. Hopwood's <i>Living Pictures</i> . "There is little doubt but that a continual rattle impinging on the ear," Hopwood complained of early projection systems,

tends to intensify irritation caused to the eye by flicker on the screen, and it is towards the minimising or concealment of this same flicker that attention is at the present time most strenuously directed. This objectionable phenomenon is traceable to the fact that the picture is periodically cut-off from view, a state of affairs which, of course, does not obtain in natural vision. It must be remembered that though persistence of vision ensures the continuance of one image until such time as another is received, yet the impression does not continue in its full strength, and the general result is therefore a perpetual increase and decrease in the brilliancy of the picture as perceived by the eye. Furthermore, the decrease of light is progressive, but every fresh view is presented in full brilliancy.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
The flicker, or perpetual increase and decrease in the brilliancy of the picture projected, is one mark of cinema's automatism: a "state of affairs" which "does not obtain in natural vision." It is unlikely that such an effect would allow for an "exploratory" relationship between viewer and projected picture. There does not seem to be a great deal of pattern, in Eliot's poem, to the sordid images thrown violently onto or against the ceiling. In this case, projection offers little relief from, and indeed exacerbates, the woman's irritability. One thinks of Leopold Bloom, in <i>Ulysses</i>, desperate, like the elderly man in <i>As Seen through a Telescope</i>, for a glimpse of a woman climbing into a carriage ("Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!"), and thwarted when a tramcar slews between. Again, the perpetual increase and decrease in brilliancy engenders (and expresses) irritation. "Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
References to visual technology, in the early poems, enabled Eliot to define the "exteriorities of language and space" (in Ellmann's phrase) which constitute social subjectivity. Indeed, to imagine consciousness as an event or drama of projection was 

<b></b>

to grasp the implication of one exteriority in the other: to find space in language. Spatial prepositions (across, against, along, among, behind, by, under, upon) play an important part in these poems. The most interesting spatial preposition of all is "across," which Eliot uses to indicate both the distance between viewer and scene, and the distance from one side of the scene to the other. "Interlude in London" was based on a visit Eliot made to London, from Paris, in April 1911. In the hotel, he told Eleanor Hinkley, "one looked through the windows, and the waiter brought in eggs and coffee . . . ."(<i>L</i>, 18). The speaker of the poem rather more complicatedly laments that he must live "across the window panes."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  He looks out through a window into the world beyond; but that world might also seem to have spread itself out, as it quite often does in Eliot's early poems, from one side of the frame to the other. The panes are transparent; and they form a screen. So it is, too, after a fashion, in "Interlude: in a Bar," of February 1911, which also concerns a space of projection. Across&#x02014;on the other side of&#x02014;the room, shifting smoke settles around "forms" which pass through or clog the brain. Yet that other side also functions as a flat surface, a kind of screen. The walls "fling back" the scattered streams of a life which appears "Visionary, and yet hard": at once "immediate" and "far," like a projected image (<i>IMH</i>, 51). How very few people there are, observes the speaker of the fourth and last poem in the "Mandarins" sequence of August 1910, who see their "outlines" on the "screen." Christopher Ricks glosses "on the screen" by reference to the <i>OED</i>'s first cinematic citation, from a 1910 issue of <i>Moving Picture World</i>: "People . . . like to see on the screen what they read about" (<i>IMH</i>, 139).
</p>

<p>
Eliot's enquiry into "across" continued in a fragment beginning "Oh little voices of the throats of men" which he enclosed, together with "The Love Song of St Sebastian," in a letter of 25 July 1914 to Conrad Aiken. On 30 September 1914, he told Aiken that the stuff he had sent "is not good, is very forced in execution, though the idea was right"(<i>L</i>, 45&#x02013;6, 58). As Ricks points out, there is throughout the fragment "some likeness to <i>The Waste Land</i>" (<i>IMH</i>, 256). An (elderly?) man describes how he has searched the world "through dialectic ways," among the living and the dead, but found only appearance, "unreal, and yet true." He then falls into a doze, like the woman in the third "Prelude," while plumes of lilac sweep across the window panes, and shadows crawl across the floor. He, too, seems to have been taken up into, or construed as, a space of projection. Eliot sought not just to come to terms with, but to explore fully, to articulate in and as the poem itself, the power of images thrown technologically onto a screen: images visionary and yet hard, unreal and yet true, like those in an early film.

Eliot on Cinema
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
On 27 November 1914, five months before his visit to the cinema with the amusing French woman, Eliot described to Eleanor Hinkley an intervention in a recent debate at Merton College. The topic of the debate had been "the threatened Americanisation of Oxford." Eliot's contribution was to point out "frankly" to those present "how much they owed to Amurrican culcher in the drayma (including the movies) in music, in the cocktail, and in the dance" (<i>L</i>, 70). He seems to have regarded the Americanization of 

<b></b>

Oxford as an opportunity rather than a threat. This brief manifesto has understandably gone down well with those who argue that throughout his career Eliot was, as David Chinitz puts it, "productively engaged" with a variety of forms of popular culture. It has gone down well, that is, except insofar as it expresses considerable enthusiasm for the movies. Chinitz, for example, uses it to substantiate his thesis that Eliot discovered the rhythms and cadences which shape some of his early poems in American popular music circa 1911. "It is 'Amurrican culcher . . . in music, in the cocktail, and in the dance' that gives Eliot's poetry its distinctive resonance"(<i>TSECD</i>, 38). Critics have been in altogether too much of a hurry, as Chinitz has been in this instance, to drop "drayma (including the movies)" from the catalogue of forms of popular culture with which Eliot can be said to have engaged productively. He himself had a fair amount to say about the movies.
</p>

<p>
The letter of 27 November 1914 to Eleanor Hinkley goes on to describe in vivid fashion further developments in the 'great ten-reel cinema drama, EFFIE THE WAIF,' which Eliot had begun to sketch out for her two weeks previously, on 14 October 1914.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

MEDICINE HAT, Wyoming, Christmas Eve. Spike Cassidy, the most notorious gambling house proprietor in the county, (ever since the early death of his wife, his only good influence), returns from the saloon, where he has won all the money and shot a man, to find a small bundle on his doorstep. He stops and stoops. A feeble cry from the bundle&#x02014;it squirms, it is warm, it is alive! He takes it tenderly in his arms.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Reformed by the "sweet insidious influence of the child," Spike becomes mayor of Medicine Hat, and the richest man in the county. But there is a "canker in the rose": Spike's ex-partner, Seedy Sam, now a ruined and desperate man, who reappears with his son Peter, a "comic simpleton." Already it is clear that no melodramatic stone will be left unturned in this bold excursion into Amurrican drayma. The action of <i>Effie the Waif</i>, chronicled in a succession of letters, piles continent upon continent and protagonist upon protagonist: Effie's mother, Gwendoline (or Guendolyne), Lady Chomleyumley; a Prussian spy making plans of the Medicine Hat gas-works; Early Bird, an "Indian Maiden"; Pegoon, an "Irish lass," daughter of Mrs Flaherty who runs the hash house; and many, many more (<i>L</i>, 62&#x02013;4, 71&#x02013;2, 76&#x02013;7).
</p>

<p>
As Susan McCabe points out, these letters demonstrate that Eliot was thoroughly familiar with the narrative conventions of popular cinema (<i>CM</i>, 39). It is significant that the narrative conventions he chose to burlesque should have been those of that quintessentially American genre, the Western. In the period immediately before World War I, the "fictitious Wild West of cowboy-and-Indian films" became the "American subject par excellence," hugely successful both at home and abroad.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  One mark of that success was the delight commentators such as Eliot took in the energy with which an American myth had been squeezed out of reckless narrative hybridity. According to an article in the <i>Times</i> of 28 January 1915, the war had by no means diminished the Western's popular appeal. "'Cowboys is off,' we had been told by an experienced friend, but if the term cowboy includes anyone who wears a sombrero and jack-boots and goes 

<b></b>

at full cinema gallop across the stage airily letting off his carbine with one hand, then he is not off." The writer goes on to describe, without naming, an "admirable drama" which "combines Wild West and Red Indians, soldiers and ting, gambling in high life, spies, bribes, and plans with all the delicious and hilarious relief that belongs to a runaway carriage and a comic coachman."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  There were many such.
</p>

<p>
Eliot's burlesque captures precisely the racial stereotyping which had underwritten the cowboy's emergence in fiction and film as the embodiment of white supremacy. Thus, there is to be a battle between Pegoon's thirty-one cowboy admirers and the thirty-one "Mexican 'greaser' admirers" of the dancer Paprika ("Huge eyes and a stiletto. Easily offended"). Like many Westerns, <i>Effie the Waif</i> includes "good" as well as "bad" Indians. For example, the heroine of Kay-Bee's <i>The Invaders</i> , a Sioux chief's daugher named Sky Star, rejects a suitor already accepted by her father, and falls for a railway surveyor. When the Sioux decide to attack the surveyors, she rides off to alert the garrison of a nearby fort, and, despite suffering a serious fall, accomplishes her mission; she dies of her injuries. In <i>Effie the Waif</i>, Early Bird, the daughter of Oopaloompah, chief of the Boozaways, is engaged to Night Hawk, but throws him over on the appearance of Wilfred Desborough, scion of one of Harlem's oldest families, who has come west to make his fortune. "Later, she is killed while saving W.'s life" (<i>L</i>, 76&#x02013;7). <i>Effie the Waif</i> was a <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, and a commentary on America.
</p>

<p>
These letters to Eleanor also make it clear that Eliot had an acute understanding not only of the narrative conventions of popular cinema, but also of the techniques it favored. He meant to visualize a series of scenes rather than merely to tell a story. Early on, as Wilfred Desborough proceeds westward up the Erie on a canal boat, "he turns and gazes at the Statue of Liberty disappearing on the horizon (not strictly accurate geography, but a fine scene)"(<i>L</i>, 63). The kind of reverse-angle cutting Eliot envisages here&#x02014;a shot of Desborough, on the canal boat, turning, followed by a shot of the Statue of Liberty&#x02014;proved hard to accomplish in the studio, and in fact found its first consistent use in Westerns such as <i>The Loafer</i> and <i>The Shotgun Ranchman</i>, which Arthur Mackley made for Essanay in 1912.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Its effect is to create a synthetic space: to superimpose the "fine scene" on "geography." "It became apparent," as Lev Kuleshov was to observe in <i>Art of the Cinema</i> , "that through montage it was possible to create a new earthly terrain that did not exist anywhere." Kuleshov describes an experiment he undertook in the early 1920s, in Moscow, in which the two protagonists are seen greeting each other even though the streets they walk down were miles apart. "They clasp hands, with Gogol's monument as a background, and look&#x02014;at the White House&#x02014;for at this point, we cut in a segment from an American film, <i>The White House in Washington</i>. In the next shot they are again on the Boulevard Prechistensk."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Kuleshov would have got the joke, in <i>Effie the Waif</i>. Eisenstein, whose disjunctive and polemical use of montage has most often been associated with modernism, might not have done.
</p>

<p>
There was experiment in cinema long before the emergence after the war of the avant-garde film-makers whose work has understandably attracted the attention of literary scholars. Westerns were often remarkably inventive. Richard Abel comments, as the trade press did at the time of the film's release, on the virtuosity of the battle-scenes in 

<b></b>

<i>The Invaders</i>.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Furthermore, the virtuosity had dramatic purpose. As the Sioux warriors plan their attack on the railwaymen, Sky Star sits in a wigwam. She leans to her right (screen left), listening intently. Outside, in a space which bears no direct relation to the wigwam, a warrior gestures extravagantly to his left (screen right), in what we assume to be the direction of the surveyors' camp. Cut to Sky Star, who recoils to her left (screen right), and then, in a gesture which mimics that of the warrior, but substitutes fear and tenderness for hostility, reaches out to her left (screen right) in the direction of the threatened white men, before glancing back horror-struck to her right (screen left). This sequence establishes Sky Star in a quasi-abstract space expressive less of the topography of the Sioux camp than of the painful split in her own allegiances. Westerns like <i>The Invaders</i> were certainly melodramatic, but it was possible to look at them, as Eliot evidently did, and even to admire them, from a technical point of view.
</p>

<p>
Eliot's eye had evidently been caught by other cinema-tricks as well. At one point in <i>Effie the Waif</i>, Lady Chomleyumley travels to India, the scene of Effie's abduction, where she interviews a <i>faquir</i>.
</p>

After a lot of hocus pocus, he produces a crystal sphere into which she gazes. The next reel of course shows what she saw in the sphere: the whole history of the foul abduction of her husband and her babe from their station in Kashmeer, with the aid of a monkey, a cobra, and a man-eating tiger. I shall elaborate this later; the point is that she is finally shown Effie in her present position in the act of spurning Peter (Effie is going to be awfully good at spurning before she gets through).

Lengthy flashbacks of the kind Eliot has in mind here came into fashion around 1910. By 1914, the device was capable of considerable complexity. In <i>The Family Record</i>, successive flashbacks reveal the histories of a man and woman long separated; in <i>The Man That Might Have Been</i>, flashbacks revealing the episodes from the hero's life contrast with reverie concerning what he "might have been" if his dead son were still alive. The fashion for lengthy flashbacks lasted until around 1917.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Such scenes quite often began with an insert shot of a letter referring to a past incident, followed, possibly after a cut back to the letter's meditative recipient, by a dissolve straight into shots of the incident referred to. Eliot's choice of the crystal sphere as transitional object was by no means implausible.
</p>

<p>
Of equal interest is his plan to cut from Gwendoline at the crystal sphere to "Effie in her present position in the act of spurning Peter." Cross-cutting between parallel events was a technique perfected by D. W. Griffith in the films he made for the Biograph Company between 1908 and 1913. In some of those films, as in the scenario for <i>Effie the Waif</i>, the cut is psychologically motivated, a product of one character's strong feeling for another; and the space thus created a "space of the imagination" where gestures meet in a "phantom embrace."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Eliot's emphasis on Effie's "position" in a particular "act" shows him thinking in precise terms about the way in which the cut from one strand of the narrative to another might be effected. His understanding of film technique was thoroughly up-to-date, and a good deal more sophisticated than that shown by cinephile writers such as Franz Kafka.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  What interested him, above 

<b></b>

all, it would seem, was the construction of a "new earthly terrain that did not exist anywhere:" a narrative space made in and by a machine.
</p>

<p>
Eliot's cinematic ambitions soon evaporated, even in the letters to Eleanor Hinkley, which increasingly fell back on other kinds of <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, notably the theatrical skit, and on accounts of "cubist teas" and the like (<i>L</i>, 82&#x02013;3 [27 January 1915] and 92 [21 March 1915]). By this time, cinema's transformation into a mass-medium dedicated primarily to narrative fiction was more or less complete. In October 1917, A. R. Orage, editor of <i>The New Age</i>, writing as R. H. Congreve, reflected on the future of the cinema.
</p>

I have recently been to a cinema exhibition, and I was not a little surprised by the contrast it presented with the moving pictures I saw some ten or eleven years ago. Then, I remember, the exhibition was extremely crude but surprisingly interesting for the length, at any rate, of half an hour. One saw scenery photographed from a moving train, rivers from source to mouth, panoramas of cities and the like. It was a vivid geography lesson. In the cinema of to-day, to judge by my recent experience, one seldom sees any of these instructive things. The programme is designed to amuse, to thrill, to interest, but never to instruct.
<!--_/extract-->

<p class="noIndent">
While remaining certain that cinema would never "command the attention of the intelligent as a form of art," Orage thought that it had its uses as a medium of mass-entertainment, and as a popular alternative to the drama and the novel.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Such were the terms in which Eliot began to think about the cinema again, in the years after World War I, when he sought to establish himself as a poet and critic by forging an alliance of "high" and "low" art against mass culture.
</p>

<p>
In the "London Letters" Eliot began to contribute to the <i>Dial</i> in 1921, cinema features on occasion as the epitome of mass culture.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  The high-low alliance he hoped to forge against this menace, as a poet and critic, was primarily with music hall. The essay in memory of Marie Lloyd published as the last of the <i>Dial</i> "London Letters" in December 1922, and then in a shorter version in the <i>Criterion</i> in January 1923, an essay unremittingly hostile to cinema, was in effect a manifesto for the new alliance. The tone of these "London Letters," and of the 1937 essay on "Religious Drama: Mediaeval and Modern," so different from that of his intervention in the debate at Merton College, have understandably led to comparisons with the critique of mass culture mounted by Theodor Adorno, F. R. Leavis, and others.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  However, the interest of Eliot's view of cinema lies in the evolution of its responsive detail rather than in the broad thrust of a polemical stance taken once and for all.
</p>

<p>
In "The Romantic Englishman, the Comic Spirit, and the Function of Criticism," published in Wyndham Lewis's journal <i>The Tyro</i>, in April 1921, Eliot worried about the expression of national life in myth; or, rather, about the lack of its expression as myth in contemporary theater. "The myth," he explained, "is imagination and it is also criticism." The re of the "Romantic Englishman" fashioned in literature from Shakespeare to Chesterton had been larger than life, and by that token a mirror in which the (white male) English reader could observe a version of himself, warts and all. In Eliot's view, the theater no longer offered "comic purgation" through myth. It was only in the music hall, he maintained, and "sometimes in the cinema," that opportunities still arose for 

<b></b>

the "partial realization" of a mythic re. Music hall exhibited the "fragments" of a "possible English myth." The strength and the weakness of the cinema both lay in the breadth of its appeal. "Charlie Chaplin is not English, or American, but a universal re, feeding the idealism of hungry millions in Czecho-Slovakia and Peru" (<i>AWL</i>, 142&#x02013;3).<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Chaplin, a product of the English music hall, appears to be disqualified by his subsequent allegiance to Hollywood, rather than by a lack of mythic status.
</p>

<p>
A year later, in the first issue of his new journal, <i>The Criterion</i>, Eliot returned briefly to Chaplin. Chaplin's "egregious" merit, he now thought, was to have "escaped in his own way from the realism of the cinema," and thus "invented a <i>rhythm</i>."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Rhythm more appropriately describes a feature of ritual performance than a feature of narrated myth. In ritual performance, rhythm produces catharsis. Eliot continued to think of rhythm as what set Chaplin's performances apart from the "realism" of cinema and theater alike. In 1933, he was still berating contemporary drama for its failure to satisfy the need for ritual. It was the rhythm so utterly absent from modern drama, he explained, which made Massine and Charlie Chaplin the "great actors" they were, and the juggling of Rastelli more "cathartic" than any performance of <i>A Doll's House</i>.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  During this period, Eliot did not dismiss cinema out of hand. He wanted to find something in it which might yet transform it from within.
</p>

<p>
So, it is worth noting, did Ezra Pound. Between 1917 and 1919, Pound supplemented his meager income by reviewing art exhibitions for <i>The New Age</i>. The set of "Art Notes" for 26 September 1918 took as its topic two films recently released by the Hepworth Company, <i>The Refugee</i> and <i>Tares</i>. Cinema, Pound declared, is no more and no less than photography, and therefore not an art. Like photography, it does not permit that process of "selection and emphasis" which constitutes art as art. It is therefore a matter for the drama critic, and only of interest insofar as it sets itself apart from the realism of photography and theater alike. This does happen, Pound went on, even in a sensational melodrama like <i>The Refugee</i>, in the odd moment of "admirably acted pantomime."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Pantomime was for Pound what rhythm was for Eliot: a fragment of myth or ritual which held the personal and the impersonal in productive (and possibly even cathartic) tension.
</p>

<p>
What made that tension more productive in music hall than it would ever be in cinema, in Eliot's view, was the co-presence of performer and audience. Since both parties to the collaboration were palpably there in the flesh in the same place at the same time, there could be no knowledge of a role (as artist, as spectator) which was not also knowledge of a person. Marie Lloyd's "moral superiority" as a performer was based on "her understanding of the people and sympathy with them, and the people's recognition of the fact that she embodied the virtues which they genuinely most respected in private life."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  In the music hall at its best, the mutual recognition constitutive of local community could not be distinguished from a mutual acknowledgement of role or status (as artist, as spectator). The result was a myth expressive of national life. In the cinema, on the other hand, unlike the music hall or the theater, performer and audience never coincide: for one party to be present, the other must be absent. This failure to coincide was an important theme in Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in 

<b></b>

the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," first published in 1936, and of a radio address Eliot gave to sixth-form students in the same year. The cinema, Eliot explained, "gives an illusion not of the stage but of life itself."
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
When we see a great music-hall comedian on the stage . . . we feel that he is conscious of his audience, that a great deal of the effect depends upon a sympathy set up between actor and audience, and we like to feel that some of his gags are spontaneous and were not thought of the night before. But when we see Laurel and Hardy, it is not Laurel and Hardy acting for <i>us</i>, it is Laurel and Hardy in another mess.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Cinema's gags have all been thought of the night before (or more likely several nights before). Laurel and Hardy's latest mess has been mechanically reproduced; they act not for us, but for any audience anywhere at any time. No prospect, then, of a performance expressive of national life.
</p>

<p>
In assembling Eliot's remarks about cinema in poems, letters, and essays, I have sought to demonstrate the fascination he felt for its automatism. He regarded that automatism as disabling, in so far as the machine came between performer and audience, denying them co-presence; and as enabling, in so far as the machine made it possible to see what the human eye alone could not have seen: the pattern thrown on a screen, a "new earthly terrain," a rhythm in excess of mimicry. His own art was not a mechanical art. But it may be that he continued to interest himself in the automatisms one machine in particular had so profoundly clarified. The work he had embarked on, in the years immediately after World War I, when he evidently thought long and hard about cinema, was a difficult long poem. Before examining <i>The Waste Land</i>, I need briefly to take account of a further possible reason for such curiosity, a reason bound up with difficulty itself.
</p>

<p>
No definition of literary modernism would be complete without some reference to Eliot's remark, in an essay of 1921 on "The Metaphysical Poets," that the modern poet had no choice but to be difficult.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Our civilization comprehends great variety and complexity, and this variety and complexity, playing upon a refined sensibility, must produce various and complex results. The poet must become more and more comprehensive, more allusive, more indirect, in order to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning. (A brilliant and extreme statement of this view, with which it is not requisite to associate oneself, is that of M. Jean Epstein, <i>La Po&#x000E9;sie d'aujord-hui</i>.)<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Jean Epstein was a leading avant-garde film-maker and film theorist. On 8 September 1921, Eliot wrote to Richard Aldington thanking him for "the Epstein book," which he had found "most interesting": "I disagree with some important conclusions, but it is a formidable work to attack, and therefore very tonic." Epstein had made his chosen writers (Aragon, Cendrars, Apollinaire) a "more serious affair, to be tackled in earnest"(<i>L</i>, 468&#x02013;9).
</p>

<p>
According to Epstein, the primary characteristic of the work of the most significant contemporary poets was that it required as much effort in the reading as in the writing.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  

<b></b>

In (or by) that effortfulness, it did justice to a world whose complexity would otherwise elude description. The most startling claim Epstein made in <i>La Po&#x000E9;sie d'aujord-hui</i> was that poetry and film had much to learn from each other's example. Theater was dead, because no actor could compete with a screen-image which rendered the slightest tremor visible, and dramatic. In cinema, simply to be, to walk, run, stop in one's tracks, turn round, was to be devoured by an audience greedy for spectacle. Epstein concluded that for mutual support cinema and the new poetry should align (<i>superposer</i>) their aesthetic strategies. The basis for that alignment lay in certain qualities of the cinematic image: qualities produced by the difference between the way a machine sees and the way a human being sees.
</p>

<p>
Cinema had become through its systematic use of close-ups a "theatre of the skin": a look into the world, that is, rather than at it. That shift from one plane to another (Eliot had wondered at "how life goes on different planes" in the third poem of his "Mandarins" sequence) unsettles the spectator's equilibrium as no event in theater had ever done, or ever could do. Equally unsettling, Epstein thought, was the image's suggestiveness. "On the screen, the essential quality of the gesture is not to complete itself." Such incompletion seemed more appropriate to poetry than to theater. Then there was of course the rapidity with which one image succeeded another. "Details jostle one another to make a poem, and in a film images cut together form a mixture, a dense entanglement." Epstein even hoped that such jostlings might provide an education in speed of response. "After a few Douglas Fairbanks, I'm knackered, but I don't feel boredom"(<i>LP</i>, 170&#x02013;5, my translation). In these and other respects, Epstein felt, cinema and the new poetry had a great deal to learn from each other. Eliot, it would appear, did not agree. But there can be little doubt that Epstein made him think again, in September 1921, after he had drafted the first three sections of <i>The Waste Land,</i> about what it took to be modern.

<p class="noIndent">
Cinema, as Stanley Cavell put it in <i>The World Viewed</i>, is characterized twice over by automatism. In the first place, it removes the "human agent" from the "task of reproduction"; in the second, it mechanically defeats our presence as spectators to the reality reproduced. "I am present not at something happening, which I must confirm, but at something that has happened, which I absorb (like a memory)." <i>The World Viewed</i> was originally published in 1971, amid developments in cinema worldwide whose common obsession with technique, with the medium's ample capacities, has since come to be regarded as in some sense "modernist." Modernism, understood as an art or literature which breaks decisively with the past, or thinks that it has broken with the past, was on Cavell's mind. He argued that the automatism in any medium is that in it which leads us to believe that the work of art to which it gives rise is "happening of itself." In a tradition, the successful writer is the one who knows how to activate the medium's automatisms. In a "modernist situation," there is no such help. Only after the event will the muse arrive to bless your work, or not. "The modernist artist has to 

<b></b>

explore the fact of automatism itself, as if investigating what it is at any time that has provided a given work of art with the power of its art as such."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
My argument has been that Eliot's understanding of the automatisms in literature developed in parallel with his understanding of cinema as a medium automatic through and through. When he wrote the poem which became <i>The Waste Land</i>, he was every bit as uncertain of the worth of the project as Cavell supposes the modernist should be. The drafts reveal the extent and vigor of his efforts to "activate" the poetic automatisms of regular meter and rhyme. For example, the original opening of "The Fire Sermon" consisted of a lengthy passage describing the morning routine of Fresca, a wealthy socialite, written in imitation of Alexander Pope.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Pound cut this, on the grounds that there was no place for such imitations in a modern poem. But Eliot continued to believe that the poem might still, on occasion, happen, or appear to happen, by itself. He continued to explore the fact of automatism. Monumental though the commentary on <i>The Waste Land</i> now is, relatively little account has been taken of the persistence in it of regular meter and rhyme. My aim in this final section is to examine the coincidence of the poem's appeal to literary tradition, made apparent to ear and eye by regularity of meter and rhyme, with what Eliot took to be most mechanical (most denatured) in a newly homogeneous mass society.
</p>

<p>
Cinema does appear in <i>The Waste Land</i>; in the manuscript, at any rate, if not in the final version. We are introduced to the "close" or "sweating" rabble which "sees on the screen" (that is, can "identify," "know," or "recognise") a "goddess or a star"; and in "silent rapture" worships from afar.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  This is cinema as Eliot had presented it in the essay on Marie Lloyd: a homogenizing mass-medium, a machine for the manufacture of passivity. However, his reference to it in the draft of an ambitious long poem is by no means casual. The reference occurs during the imitation of Pope. It would have been inserted into the account of Fresca's brilliant career as a celebrity which arises out of, or rises above, the meticulous, unsparing description of her morning routine (breakfast, toilet, bath). Those who witnessed her emergence onto the "varied scene" of fashionable society (the stage, the turf, boxing peers), we are told, were as comprehensively struck by her "supernatural grace" as Aeneas had been by that of his mother, when the goddess made herself known without warning, or as the sweating rabble is by that of the film-star whose image saturates the screen.
</p>

<p>
The double simile affords Fresca a double apotheosis: first, mock-heroically, as Venus; then, by mere extrapolation, since a celebrity is already a star on a smaller scale, as Norma Shearer or Constance Talmadge. Eliot's purpose is not to cut Fresca down to size, any more than Pope's purpose in <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> had been to cut Belinda down to size. It is, rather, to understand the basis of her appeal. Hence his hesitation in defining what an audience does&#x02014;identify, recognize, know&#x02014;when it sees a star on the screen. Aeneas's response to his mother clearly combines recognition of her as a person with acknowledgement of her divine status. The cinema audience acknowledges a star's divine status, as the medium's creation, but also recognizes, or would like to recognize, a certain individuality: the individuality of a being which must be assumed to undergo elsewhere (off-screen) a routine involving breakfast, bath, and toilet. Eliot's interest 

<b></b>

in Fresca is an extension of his interest in Chaplin's ability to transcend realism, and thus create myth. That transcendence was in his view merely automatic: a product of the photographic machine's capacity to isolate and endlessly reproduce the "rhythm" of a particular performance. But he did not dismiss it out of hand. In fact, he wanted some of it for his poem. For Fresca's apotheosis does indeed rise above, as well as arising out of, the banal insistence on beverages. Both, however, have been produced by the same literary automatism.
</p>

<p>
My suggestion is that in such selective usage regularity of meter and rhyme acts (on ear and eye alike) as a kind of frame. In cinema, as in still photography, the frame both enables and disables. On the one hand, it serves, as James Lastra has noted, as an index of the act of witnessing, because it supposes a viewer who is part of the same world as the activities represented.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  On the other, it permits us to see only as a machine sees; not as we ourselves would have seen had we in fact been there, a part of that world. Literature, of course, is not indexical. But the heroic couplet, as Pope used it, as Eliot uses it, does powerfully indicate, by its segmentation of event, by parcelling narrative out into glimpse or sound-bite, the presence of an observer. But which observer? Or <i>what</i> observer, we should perhaps ask, since the morning routine does not seem to have been witnessed in person. Eliot sees Fresca as literary tradition had already seen her, as Pope saw Belinda. The frame both enables and disables. The scene it presents is, as Eliot said of the image on the screen, visionary, and yet hard; unreal, and yet true.
</p>

<p>
Eliot evidently agreed with Pound that the Fresca passage added up to rather too much automatism. But the poem as a whole methodically departs from and returns to regularity of meter and rhyme. Indeed, the process evident in the Fresca passage&#x02014;whereby the very exactness (and exactingness) of the measure taken of the mechanical modern bourgeois or petty-bourgeois life provokes a wild rhetorical flourish, an antic gesture&#x02014;creates a pattern within it. The pattern first becomes evident in the Unreal City passage which concludes "The Burial of the Dead" (<i>CPP</i>, 62&#x02013;3). As Eliot's notes make clear, the unreality of the crowd of commuters flowing across London Bridge is an effect already there in Dante (mediated, perhaps, by James Thompson), and in Baudelaire.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  The opening lines of the passage at once acknowledge the power of that effect and outdo it by their virtuosity, as Christopher Ricks has shown.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  Eliot makes his own uncanniness, or makes uncanniness his own. The lines which follow seem by comparison rather <i>too</i> canny in their mimesis of the routines of the commuting life.

The sighs are from Dante. But they rapidly give way to a dull pedestrian beat which is that both of office-workers heading for the office and of the verse itself, which has eased obediently back into iambic pentameter. An iambic up-and-down captures the office-workers' steady progress up the hill and down King William Street. A rhyme bolts 

<b></b>

two syntactically separate units of description together. Such cast-iron regularity could scarcely fail to produce, as though automatically, its own tribute to mimesis. "With a dead sound": the double iambic foot (two stressed syllables after two unstressed) creates, by varying a pattern forcefully established, a dead sound of its own. The author of these lines is an automatism of technique engendered, or so it would appear, by the automatism of (some kinds of) modern experience. Iambic pentameter functions here, and to more precise effect than in the Fresca passage, as the frame which both enables and disables.
</p>

<p>
The exercise of technique has dulled the poem's engagement with literary tradition down to a description which merely documents: to "footage" of the kind which constitutes many an early film of London bridges and streets. The crowd thus captured was often thought to consist of automata, or ghosts. "Their smiles are lifeless," Maxim Gorky had said of the people in the very first Lumi&#x000E8;re films, "although their movements are full of living energy and are so swift as to be almost imperceptible. Their laughter is silent, although you see the muscles contracting in their grey faces."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Visionary, and yet hard; unreal, and yet true. The makers of these documentary or "actuality" films had sought to provoke in the urban crowd they filmed gestures of recognition or acknowledgement (of another person, of the camera itself) which would override the lifelessness. Eliot does something similar, in burlesque. As the automatized description of Fresca's morning routine produces by reaction a simile comparing her celebrity to that of a goddess or film-star, so the automatized description of a commuter's morning routine produces by reaction the hearty welcome the speaker affords a well-known face which is also that of a mythic personage. "There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: 'Stetson!'" The line balloons beyond pentameter, beyond that which might be thought to happen of itself. It expands into antic improvisation. The speaker reminds Stetson that they fought together at Mylae, during the first Punic War, and slyly enquires whether the corpse he planted last year in his garden has sprouted yet (<i>CPP,</i> 63). "Some poetic devilry is at work in the closing lines of 'The Burial of the Dead,'" Grover Smith remarks, "an instance of the 'skits' to which Eliot confessed."<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
So who was Stetson? The Stetson was a hat with a broad brim and high crown customarily worn by cowboys. The <i>OED</i> cites various contemporary catalogue entries promoting the J. B. Stetson "Boss of the Plains" sombrero hat. On 15 March 1921, the <i>Times</i> announced that the John B. Stetson Company had just opened new showrooms in New Bond Street.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  Stetson might be regarded as the last gasp of the energies which had gone into <i>Effie the Waif</i>. If Venus returns as a screen-goddess, the soldier from Mylae returns as a cowboy: he is at once a person met on the street, and a re from classical legend, and that re's reincarnation on the screen. In this case, however, the re is male rather than female. Because his automatism is so aggressively larger-than-life, in its way with corpses, Stetson provokes a certain devilry, as Fresca would never have done. Eliot finds in him and his imputed deeds a rhythm or pantomime exceeding realism. His appearance on the screen has provoked an overwhelming question, a question to which there is no answer.
</p>

<p>
The poem's most extensive and most savage commentary on the homogenization of modern urban middle-class or lower-middle-class experience takes the form of a scene 

<b></b>

in "The Fire Sermon" set during the "violet hour" at the end of the working day, when a house agent's clerk seduces a typist in her apartment. As Lawrence Rainey points out, it was an innovation, on Eliot's part, to put a typist into a "serious" work of literature; hitherto typists had featured only in light verse, and in genre and realist fiction (<i>AWL</i>, 108&#x02013;9). In a story first published as "The Common Round" in the <i>New Age</i>, in 1917, and then in revised form as "The Pictures," in <i>Art and Letters</i>, in 1919, and as "Pictures" in <i>Bliss and Other Stories</i> , Katherine Mansfield drew together typing, cinema, and one or two other preoccupations which were to surface in <i>The Waste Land</i>. Miss Ada Moss, a resting actress, wakes up cold and hungry in a "Bloomsbury top-floor back," as a "pageant" of "Good Hot Dinners" of the kind favored by Eliot's Lil and Albert passes fantasmatically "across the ceiling." Ada aims to fortify herself at once against her landlady's violent demands for rent and against the "common round" she will have to make of the theatrical agencies with a cup of tea at an ABC, where the waitress boasts that her man is just back from the army, as brown as mahogany; he has brought her a brooch from Dieppe. The common round, with its perpetual prospect of uncommonness in the shape of a part in a play or a film, is all that stands between Ada and these cockney tormentors. At the North-East Film Company, a "beautiful typist" (the "Cinema Typist," in the original version) appears at the top of the stairs on which the applicants wait to dismiss them all brusquely. At the Bitter Orange Company, there is a form to be filled in: "'Can you aviate&#x02014;high-dive&#x02014;drive a car&#x02014;buck-jump&#x02014;shoot?' read Miss Moss." Looking good in a Stetson would no doubt have been a plus. At the end of the ordeal, Ada's only feeling is of relief. "'Well, that's over,' she sighed." She allows herself to be picked up and taken home by a "stout gentleman."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Mansfield sets lower-middle-class aspiration, and the moral laxness it induces, against a robust proletarian acceptance of life as it is and always has been; as Eliot was to do in <i>The Waste Land</i>. Eliot reinforced the contrast by framing Lil's tale in free verse barely distinguishable from prose, and the clerk's seduction of the typist in stately quatrains. Technique's automatism, listlessly sort-of-rhyming "at once" with "response," "defence" with "indifference," superbly renders her capitulation (<i>CPP</i>, 68). In this case, mythic apotheosis does not emerge from within the scene, provoked by automatism, but surrounds it from the outset in the shape of Tiresias, its perpetual witness. Tiresias, Eliot said, is a "mere spectator," and yet the most important "personage" in the poem. What he <i>sees</i>, in fact, is its "substance" (<i>CPP</i>, 78).
</p>

<p>
Victorian poetry had prepared Tiresias for Eliot as the re of the blind seer "outside of death and birth," to whom knowledge always comes "before" the event, or "afterward," in Algernon Swinburne's version, but never during it; never at the time, never in the moment. The knowledge, when it came, was of misconduct. "I, Tiresias the prophet, seeing in Thebes / Much evil . . . "<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  Eliot's Tiresias, however, has been up-dated by association with the violet hour at the end of the working day, when the "human engine" awaits release like a taxi throbbing in readiness. "I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives . . . " (<i>CPP</i>, 68). There may even be an echo here of Epstein's defence of difficulty in modern literature. Among the thoughts stirred in him by a line from Blaise Cendrars's <i>Dix-neuf po&#x000E8;mes &#x000E9;lastiques</i>&#x02014;"J'ai des pommettes 

<b></b>

&#x000E9;lectriques au bout de mes nerfs" ("I have electric cheek-bones at my nerves' ends")&#x02014;are "que rien ne donne mieux l'impression de nervosit&#x000E9; qu'un moteur tr&#x000E9;pidant" (<i>tr&#x000E9;pider</i> is to throb, quiver, or vibrate, with anxiety, with ardor) (<i>LP</i>, 58&#x02013;9). The throb in the "moteur tr&#x000E9;pidant" of the clerks and typists waiting for work to end is a throb in Tiresias, too; and, I would say, in the engine of technique, of the quatrains which renders what he will see and has already seen.
</p>

<p>
There is a throb in the scene's spatiality, a spatiality projected by and for Tiresias, a spatiality built into the very terms of that projection. Tiresias maintains that he has foresuffered all "Enacted on this same divan or bed." In English, the determiners (or specifying agents) "this" and "that" are ranged along a scale of proximity. The former refers to things which are close (in time or space) to the speaker, things which bear some relation to him or her; the latter refers to things which are distant from and bear no relation to the speaker. (I talk about "this" table if I happen to be leaning on it at the time, "that" table if it stands at the far end of the room.) "This" carries associations of intimacy, "that" of strangeness, of the unknown. When the prophet in the desert is beckoned in under the shadow of "<i>this</i> red rock," in "The Burial of the Dead," we feel, for a moment, that we might conceivably be in the vicinity of or the approaches to a source of redeeming knowledge; rather less so, perhaps, when Madame Sosostris hesitates over "<i>this</i> card." In "A Game of Chess," by contrast, we find ourselves in an enclosed room, listening to "that noise," which might or might not be the wind under the door, but which is in any case radically unfamiliar. In the poem's first section, we edge towards a tantalizing but ultimately sterile knowledge; in the second, we edge away from a threat to the very possibility of knowledge.<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Tiresias throbs between an intimate foreknowledge of what has been enacted on <i>this</i> same divan or bed, and the typist's separation of herself from its enactment: "Well now that's done . . . " She absents herself from a sense of occasion, smoothing her hair "with automatic hand," putting a record on the gramophone.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  Tiresias, by contrast, wants intimacy, the intimacy of arousal. He may not share Prufrock's fondness for body-hair, but he does unmistakably linger over the undergarments piled on the divan (<i>CPP</i>, 68&#x02013;9). For a moment, vision closes in on touch. Like Prufrock, Tiresias has put himself in the picture, gendered male, in and through a description of arousal.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  Ellmann quite rightly calls him a Peeping Tom (<i>PI</i>, 97). But the divan has as little to offer by way of redeeming knowledge as the red rock or Madame Sosostris's blank card. Tiresias, like Prufrock, is a visitor before and after the event, automatically. He throbs, within the automatisms of language itself, between his own urgent <i>this</i> and the typist's listless <i>that</i>; between the desire for presence and the desire for absence. To that extent, we might speak of him as a magic lantern or even a camera-projector equipped with consciousness.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  For cinematic experience is uniquely both of <i>this</i> (the lived moment, utterly absorptive) and of <i>that</i> (an event which took place somewhere else some time ago). In cinema, this is always already "that," and that "this." <i>The Waste Land</i> struggles subsequently to disarm the throbbing automatisms of perception and behavior compulsively repeated in "The Fire Sermon." In its final movement, it attempts to separate out decisively "that" sound high in the air from "this, and this only": from a knowledge which redeems.

Ezra Pound and John Rodker
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In 1928, Ezra Pound provided for the final issue of <i>The Exile</i> a set of editorial notes, or "Data." One of these notes had to do with cinema. "The machine film, the 'abstract' or Gestalt film now exists," Pound declared. The machine film was the product of twelve years of "research" conducted independently of literature and the visual arts, he went on, though with some overlap (for example, Jean Epstein's collaboration with Blaise Cendrars). In March 1923, in <i>The Dial</i>, Pound had praised the montage sequences of machinery in motion in Abel Gance's film of that year, <i>La Roue</i>, though he gave most of the credit to literature, and to contemporary abstract art. "Thanks, we presume, to Blaise Cendrars, there are interesting moments, and effects which belong, perhaps, only to the cinema. At least for the sake of argument we can admit that they are essentially cinematographic.' In 1928, he felt able to look back charitably on a 'noble effort' ruined by a 'punk sentimental plot."<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Even in retrospect, Robert Wiene's <i>The Cabinet of Dr Caligari</i> , abjectly imitative of contemporary art, seemed to Pound a complete failure. However, he went on to argue that German culture had subsequently absorbed the "real art movement since 1900," thus producing a properly abstract cinema. In Walter Ruttmann's <i>Berlin: City Symphony</i> , he maintained, "we have at last a film that will take serious aesthetic criticism." It would be sheer snobbery not to acknowledge that such a film was "on parity with the printed page." European cinema, at any rate, had finally earned his approval. America, by contrast, ignoring the real art movement since 1900, had fallen behind. "<i>The</i> American film," Pound had regretfully to report, "is <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i>, a bed-time story told for a child of the desert"("D," 115).
</p>

<p>
It was Pound who introduced the young American cameraman Dudley Murphy to Fernand L&#x000E9;ger, thus helping to bring about one of the most properly abstract films of the decade, <i>Ballet m&#x000E9;canique</i> .<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  Indeed, L&#x000E9;ger was eager to credit Pound and Murphy with a "technical novelty" of which he had made considerable use: an optical prism held over the lens in such a way as to shatter the image into overlapping and interpenetrating forms.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  The novelty was the outcome of experiments Pound had undertaken with Alvin Langdon Coburn in the production of multiple-image photographic portraits by means of an instrument known as a "vortoscope." Some of these were exhibited at the London Camera Club in 1917.<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  Pound, too, more or less knew what he was talking about when it came to abstract cinema. Even so, it is hard to disagree with Michael North's conclusion that by 1923 his own work was "far too advanced" to receive any "significant impetus" from his relatively brief association with cinema.<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  Though there does seem to be something vortoscopic about his celebrated description of the "radiant world" known to medieval philosophers, where "one thought cuts through another with clean edge": "magnetisms that take form, that are seen, or that border the visible, the matter of Dante's <i>paradiso</i>, the glass under water, the form that seems a form seen in a mirror, these realities perceptible to the sense."<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The most striking claim Pound made in his <i>Exile</i> essay was that the success of films like <i>Berlin: City Symphony</i> "should flatten out the opposition (to Joyce, to me, to Rodker's Adolphe) with steam-rolling ease and commodity, not of course that the authors intended 

<b></b>

it"("D," 114). This new abstract cinema might yet create an audience for the new (or newish) abstract literature. John Rodker's <i>Adolphe 1920</i> had been appearing in <i>The Exile</i>, and was published in book form in 1930. It is a text preoccupied with cinema. At one point, the protagonist treats himself to a session with some kind of mechanical peep-show, most likely a mutoscope. The mutoscope was a motion picture device consisting of a series of photographs mounted on a cylinder. Mutoscopes showed a wide range of "films," but the most popular tended to involve young women in various states of undress. "Mutoscope pictures in Capel Street: for men only," Leopold Bloom recalls in the "Nausicaa" episode of <i>Ulysses</i>. "Peeping Tom. Willy's hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? <i>Lingerie</i> does it."<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  Rodker's protagonist, lacking Bloom's interest in the way things work, rapidly becomes absorbed in the "prospects of some approaching revelation." He slips a coin into the machine.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It began to mutter. Where its heart was, a woman rose from a chair, smiled, patted her elaborate hair, unhooked a shoulder-of-mutton blouse, a petticoat or two, stood self-consciously for a minute in lace-edged drawers, laced boots and black stockings, smiling a timid 1890 smile. Wondering, fearful of losing it, he thought he could not bear her smile to fade, yet suddenly the eyes were dark, and he was with his thoughts. She too in that darkness, from which for a moment he had called her. A coin brought her back: as though gratefully she shyly reappeared, went through all her senseless gestures, smiled and smiled. And darkness again, heavy, inevitable. That room, that sofa, filled his brain with warm shapes and comforting light, and the woman moved amicably through it.<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
<i>Ulysses</i> was in a number of respects <i>Adolphe 1920</i>'s most significant point of departure. It would be possible, none the less, to see in this passage an elaboration not only of Bloom's curiosity about Willy's hat and what the girls did with it, but of the scene revealed to another modernist Peeping Tom. Tiresias, too, pores over lingerie. He, too, brings back over and over again out of the darkness an event in a room, on a sofa. If Prufrock is a magic lantern equipped with consciousness, then perhaps Tiresias is a mutoscope (rather than a camera-projector) equipped with consciousness. Both make their visits with the aid of technology's throbbing engine. Those visits articulate Eliot's will-to-automatism.
</p>

<p>
My argument here has been that Eliot's affinity with cinema went a great deal deeper than any belated discovery of montage technique in his poems would suggest. Eliot got to grips with cinema in a way that Pound, for all his vortoscopic enthusiasms, never did. It is worth noting that Rodker was a part of Eliot's circle in the years leading up to <i>The Waste Land</i>. His Ovid Press published <i>Ara Vos Prec</i> in 1920. The closest parallel (in fact, the only parallel) I can think of to Stetson's appearance in "The Burial of the Dead" is Rodker's "Wild West Remittance Man," a poem which peppers the boredom of English offices and drawing-rooms with baroque gun-slinger fantasy; it was published in <i>The Little Review</i> in July 1919, and then in <i>Hymns</i> .<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>  Furthermore, on 10 July 1922, Eliot wrote to Rodker, asking him to contribute a three-thousand-word article on the cinema to <i>The Criterion</i> (<i>L</i>, 540). Had it been written, that article might have altered literary modernism's relation to cinema fundamentally. Even in its absence, we should acknowledge the inventiveness of the uses Eliot made in his work of movie-going. We still owe a debt to the amusing French woman.

Derrida's essay is also an important point of departure for Christophe Wall-Romana's argument that Mallarm&#x000E9;, a keen observer of technological development, either wrote or made plans for various "cinematic sublations of the page and the book," including <i>Un coup de d&#x000E9;s</i> , "one long strip of visually montaged text," and in the project around Le Livre (1895&#x02013; ), a performance involving the projection of images, as well as dance and pantomime: Wall-Romana, "Mallarm&#x000E9;'s Cinepoetics: The Poem Uncoiled by the Cin&#x000E9;matographe, 1893&#x02013;98," <i>PMLA</i> 120, 2005, 128&#x02013;47; 141&#x02013;2.

Eliot offers an immediate qualification. We ought not to be affected by myth, he argues, "as the newspapers say little boys are by nature cinema desperados. The myth is degraded by the child who points a loaded revolver at another, or ties his sister to a post, or rifles a sweet-shop" (<i>AWL</i>, 143). The previous autumn, the British Board of Film Censors had voiced concern about the susceptibility of the public imagination to "crime" films. "Stories dealing with 'costume' crime, however, such as cowboy films and Mexican robberies, are placed in a different category and regarded simply as dramatic and thrilling adventures with no connexion whatever with the lives or possible experiences of young people:" "Love and Crime on the Film," <i>Times</i>, 18 October 1920, 9. Some commentators could not see the difference. "Why murder in Mexico should be shown on the film, while murder in Mile-end is anathema, it is difficult to see:" "Film Censorship," <i>Times</i>, 27 October 1920, 15.

<p id="lead">In his collection of essays, <i>Conversations in Bloomsbury</i>, the celebrated Indian writer Mulk Raj Anand describes the early beginnings of his novelistic craft as a young university student in England. Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> speaks to him across the divide of culture and nurtures his desire to write: I "recognized myself in the hero of <i>Portrait</i>" he says.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In <i>Portrait</i> Joyce presents not only Stephen Dedalus's inner world, compelling to Anand in its own right, but also, significantly, a version of what is taking place within Anand himself. Comparing Joyce to his mentor, the important Islamic poet Iqbal, and his poetic cycle <i>Secrets of the Self</i>, Anand prefers to follow Joyce, claiming him as a kindred spirit and model, if not strictly a compatriot. He decides that "the portrait is a good model for me, if I want to stage the recovery of self . . . in a novel," and resolves to begin that novel almost immediately. Anand secretly determines to pattern himself after Joyce, taking specific instruction not merely from Joyce's mode of narration and his representation of self-development, but also from his rejection of religion or mysticism, and his use of sound to transmit extra-linguistic meaning in prose (<i>CB</i>, 7). From this moment, he begins his effort to forge a new English language tradition in fiction for India. </p>

<p>What sense do we make of Anand's remarks about Joyce? This essay will begin to address the complex intertextual web linking Joyce's <i>Portrait</i> to Anand's early writings, most notably his novel, <i>Coolie,</i> written between 1933&#x2013;35. In this comparison I will argue that we can see important elements of Joyce's style also appear in Anand's work, especially his insistence on reality rather than what Anand calls "religious illusionism," his use of 

<b></b>

limited perspective and focalization as a means of representing and critiquing Bildung, and his emphasis on sound as a marker for the uncontrollability of language. Further, I will suggest that Anand's use of Joycean techniques to trace the life of a displaced, wandering coolie highlights the political implications of <i>Portrait</i>. That Anand becomes a follower of Gandhi and embarks upon a long career as a social activist and writer of engag&#x00E9; fiction, even as he remains a follower of Joyce, points to the path between Joyce's experimental prose and the politically engaged novels of Anand. Indeed, the connection asks us to rework and redefine our understanding of engaged writing. Sartre long ago claimed that "art loses nothing in engagement. On the contrary . . . the always new requirements of the social and the metaphysical engage the artist in finding a new language and new techniques." <sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Yet in practice, experimental fiction has often been described as separate from engaged writing, with modernism being distinguished from the more directly political work often dubbed "thirties literature."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Reading Joyce and Anand together works against this separation, asking us to consider stylistic experimentation as a spur to new possibilities of engagement while offering modes of political expression not possible within a conventional realist novel. </p>

<p>Further, if Anand, as displaced colonial subject, encounters Joyce's phrase, "I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race," as meaningful for his own political situation (and this is the specific passage he cites), then we must also see Anand's use of that phrase as important for understanding Joyce.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Thus the connection between the two authors provides us with a new way into the ongoing discussion of colonial textuality from a crucial transnational perspective. The question is not simply a unilateral matter of influence&#x2014;though to be sure Joyce influenced Anand. Rather, this encounter highlights the multidirectional flow of global literature and culture, where streams of discourse move not just from metropolis to colony, or even back from colony to metropolis, but as in this example, from colony to metropolis to another colony and back again. As Elleke Boehmer points out,  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>oppositional nationalist, proto-nationalist, and anti-colonialist movements learn from one another as well as drawing from their own internal political and cultural resources or the political culture of their oppressors. Looked at from this perspective, anti-colonial nationalism emerges as an allusive, cross-cultural, intertextual, or interdisciplinary phenomenon.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Though this allusiveness or intertextuality is most often remarked in a much later, post-independence group of writers, I will claim that we can already see it nascent in the contact between Joyce and Anand. Critics have pointed out the ways in which early twentieth-century Indian writers felt connected to the Irish struggle. Irish writers, such as Yeats and the Theosophist Joseph Cousins, also turned to Indian writing, often as source material for spiritual and formal exploration.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Political writers in Ireland had, by the early years of the twentieth century, begun writing about the commonalities between British colonial rule in Ireland and in India.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  But what I want to argue in this essay goes beyond remarking upon influences or commonalities, which presume a 

<b></b>

certain arbitrariness. Discussing connections between the colonies and the metropolis, Boehmer remarks,  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>merely tracing correspondences . . . can appear to leave too much, as it were, to coincidence. In that the new colonial writers themselves represented dissent and difference from source, their contribution can perhaps be interpreted in a stronger sense. Can they be seen as forming a constitutive part of the modernist movement rather than as being merely its symptom, or sympathetic effect?<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">I will argue that the "correspondence" between Joyce and Anand moves beyond coincidence and demonstrates Anand's position as a constitutive part of modernism, thus helping to realign modernism along global lines.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  I will also argue that placing Anand in this way forces us to reconsider Joyce's writing within the context of Anand's direct political engagement, which was perceived as so dangerous in pre-Independence India that his first three novels were banned there.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  When we read Joyce and Anand together, what emerges is a complex intertextual exchange that highlights the specificity of their colonial critiques; the challenges their work poses to conceptions of a representative, ethical subject; and the very real political engagement, extended and made more overt in Anand's oeuvre, of their modernist narrative modes. </p>

<p>First, consider the question of Anand's use of Joyce as a model for representing self-development, or Bildung, in literature. Mulk Raj Anand was born in Peshawar in 1905 to the family of a civil servant, and distinguished himself as a teenager by his studiousness, his voluminous reading in Urdu, Persian, and English (especially the British Romantics), and his interest in poetry. He began writing poetry at an early age as a disciple of the poet Iqbal. In the heady period after 1918, Anand became swept up in growing rebellion in the Punjab. He was arrested and caned in Amritsar, where his family had been living, for innocently breaking curfew during the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre of 1919, one of the most bloody and infamous conflicts in the history of the Raj, in which soldiers opened fire on ten thousand civilians.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  He was again arrested in 1924 for political activism in Lahore. His father, a government functionary, became infuriated by Anand's involvement in politics and punished Anand's mother in retaliation. To stop this punishment, with money from his mother and his mentor, Iqbal, Anand traveled to London where he studied philosophy at the University of London, while also attending lectures by luminaries such as G. E. Moore and C. D. Broad. His connections within the London literary world brought him into the living rooms of Leonard and Virginia Woolf, and into contact with E. M. Forster, T. S. Eliot and most of the res of literary Bloomsbury, though he became increasingly uncomfortable in that milieu. He experienced the 1926 General Strike in London as a watershed event in which he recognized similarities between the British workers and the Untouchables in India. He realized that "not only were the British imperious and strong-minded in the colonies, but [they] also could suppress their own working people."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  But his long and illustrious career as a writer of fiction began in 1922. In that year he first read Joyce, devouring both <i>A Portrait of the Artist </i>and later <i>Ulysses</i> (which he found on a trip to Paris) and discovering in them a new vocation. That he should speak of Iqbal 

<b></b>

and Joyce in the same sentence when describing his early literary influences highlights Joyce's importance to Anand. </p>

<p>In fact, what Anand tells us is that Joyce seems to offer a <i>better</i> model for describing the development of self, at least as Anand sees it, than Iqbal&#x2014;a somewhat surprising comment for an Indian who grew up under Iqbal's tutorage. Anand seems explicitly to embrace the idea of the novel as a vehicle for representing self-development within material and social life, which clearly owes much to the tradition of the Bildungsroman, and he patterns his comments about Joyce in order to emphasize the Bildungsroman's focus on the hero's development as a worldly journey which also has world-historical significance. As Bakhtin states, in the Bildungsroman </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[the] hero emerges <i>along with the world</i> and he reflects the historical emergence of the world itself. He is no longer within an epoch, but on the border between two epochs, at the transition point from one to the other. This transition is accomplished in him and through him.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">While novels in the Bildungsroman tradition from the twentieth century may not reflect the same order of faith in this epochal transition as do those in the eighteenth, the question of transition remains paramount, as does the coincidence of the hero's attempted emergence with that of his country or milieu.  </p>

<p>Joyce's model, Anand says, also rejects "religious illusionism" in favor of an insistence on material reality as the scene of the self's struggle toward definition and therefore of its significance. In contrast, if we look briefly at Iqbal's <i>Secrets of the Self</i> we find a section entitled: "Exposition of the theory that order in the Universe originates from the self and that the continuation of the life of individual existence depends upon the self." The poet claims: "The form of all existence is / effect alone of the self."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The situation of the self in the world is a question made subservient in Iqbal to the expansion and power of self that becomes, over the course of the long poem, mystical and religious. And yet for Joyce in <i>Portrait</i> as for Anand in all his work, the very crux of the problem of self is its embeddedness in the material world and its hierarchies of language and behavior. While Stephen might <i>wish</i> that all existence be the effect of his own self (and certainly he is subject to the sin of pride), the world of <i>Portrait</i> and its multiplicity of discourses prevent that. Further, as I will discuss, the problem of whether or not the self can be seen as universalizable or representative subject, as in Enlightenment versions of political citizenship, becomes key for both Joyce and Anand, and a means by which they build anticolonial politics into their reengagement with the Bildungsroman. To put it bluntly, part of what Anand is finding in Joyce, and not in Iqbal (despite the fact that Iqbal was to become crucial political re during the struggle for independence), is engagement with the self within the context of a colonial reality rather than the metaphysical world. </p>

<p>I want to turn, then, to Anand's work and ultimately to the idea of Bildung in his novel <i>Coolie </i>and in <i>Portrait</i>. Anand, who died in 2004, was the author of, at best count: eighteen novels, three collections of short stories, several books of essays, including such seminal works as "Is There a Contemporary Indian Civilization?" and many collections

<b></b>

 of Indian fairy tales. He also wrote art history and literary criticism, gathered Indian recipes, and published assessments of the philosophies of Gandhi and Nehru. In general, though, treatments of his work in histories of Indian writing in English focus on the novels written between his return trip to India in 1932 and Independence. Because his work is influenced by his reading in socialism, which he began in London at the time of the General Strike, and by his effort to provide a detailed account of the lives of ordinary Indians, Anand is often referred to quite simply as a "social realist" with attendant remarks upon his "limitations," especially in his later works.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Anand's first novel <i>Untouchable</i> (written between 1928 and 1932) is his most famous, and the one most often discussed in connection with his early literary influences, perhaps because it was championed by E. M. Forster (who arranged for it to be published after its having been rejected by nineteen presses) (<i>WH</i>, 26). An apocryphal story is often recounted about Gandhi's influence on this novel, which Anand brought, half written, with him from London to Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram. According to this story, Gandhi himself edited the manuscript, cutting the excess from it, and insisting that its hero become less of "a Bloomsbury intellectual" (<i>HIL</i>, 175). Though there is no extant manuscript and no evidence for this story, the assumed trajectory of Anand's early career still rests on this tale, guiding critics to comment on Anand's return to India as a "decisive shift," a return to authenticity, and an embrace of social realism (ibid.).  </p>

<p>On the other hand, <i>Untouchable</i>, like much of the succeeding work, also continues to speak to the European fiction of the period, which Anand still read and admired. As Paul Saint-Amour observes, "though the substrate of its first 120 pages is a documentary, 'day-in-the-life' realism, this unfussy surface is warped and ornamented by a boggling variety of other styles, modes, and lexicons" many of which owe recognizable debts to European narrative modes.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The hero, a poor sweeper boy named Bakha, is in a distinctly Indian situation of being abused by upper class Indian and British characters, suffering both the indignity of being forced by caste to clean latrines for others, and the rejection, even when trying to rescue an injured boy, that his "polluted" status brings upon him. The novel takes place over one day, in which Bakha is also exposed to the preaching of Christian missionaries, the charismatic speeches of Gandhi, and the Socialist lectures of a British-educated poet. Yet, as many have remarked, Bakha's self-awareness forms the core of the novel, allowing us to look at the material circumstance of his restricted life through his limited perceptive, and from time to time presented in interior monologue.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Anand said of the work, he had wanted to show Bakha's "unique sensitiveness as against the people of the upper caste who thought that merely touching him is a degradation" (qtd. In <i>WH</i>, 30). In the published novel Bakha could in no way be termed a "Bloomsbury intellectual"; indeed, he is most often described by critics as "na&#x00EF;ve." Yet the novel clearly speaks to the European tradition of realism and its development of interior perspectives and focalized narration as well as to twentieth-century developments in narrative form. The novel's "one day in the life" structure must also certainly be discussed in connection with <i>Mrs. Dalloway </i>and<i> Ulysses</i>, which we know Anand read and recommended to his friends, and in relation to Joyce's emphasis on material existence within the context of a focalized narrative. 

<b></b>

The novel's triumph is in the combination of the view of its untouchable hero through the complexity of his inner thoughts and emotions, and "its prose [that] subtly picks up the dense corporeality and tactility of Bakha's existence" (<i>HIL</i>, 177). </p>

<p>Anand's next novel, <i>Coolie</i>, which follows the short lifetime of a poor Indian laborer, is more closely linked to the Bildungsroman tradition and its critique in <i>Portrait</i> and thus helps raise political questions about the status of the "universal man" within that tradition. In <i>Coolie </i>we see the young hero Munoo forced out of his home in a hill village and sent to find his way through a number of menial jobs in an extraordinary series of locations throughout India. While working as a servant for a bank official, in a pickle factory, in a cotton mill, or as a rickshaw boy, before his death at fifteen from consumption, Munoo encounters the entire social fabric of India. He is befriended in unexpected places: among other servants, coolies, and cotton mill workers but also in the house of the pickle factory owner and in the home of an emancipated Anglo-Indian woman.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Yet the brilliance of the novel is not in the specific details of the various trials that Munoo is made to face: rather as in <i>Untouchable,</i> it lies in the novel's focus on Munoo's internal life and his struggle to respond to the varieties of discourses that surround him and the power hierarchies associated with them. </p>

<p>While the style of the novel contains few of Joyce's moments of fixed internal focus, it is focalized in much the same way, with a third person perspective that is limited to what Munoo can know and understand, and which develops over the course of the novel as Munoo grows up. Munoo's lack of experience in the opening chapters, while not quite on the order of Stephen Dedalus's, is strikingly represented in a tone both limited in perspective and deeply ironic. For example, in an early scene that takes place in the house where his uncle leaves him to work as a servant, he suffers constant reprimand because he has no idea of the rules of proper servant conduct, and no one bothers to tell him. We follow along with Munoo as he blunders over and over again and is punished. When the lady of the house turns on the gramophone, Munoo wanders in from the kitchen, dripping utensils in hand: "He felt emboldened. He wanted to hear the music, to see and touch the singing machine . . . 'how lucky I am, he thought, that there is a wonder machine in the house where I have come to serve'" . Munoo's naivet&#x00E9; guides the narrative here, which can only hint at what he does not understand. He gets carried away by the music and begins to dance around on all fours like a monkey, but Munoo is completely unaware that he is literally fulfilling the expectation of the lady of the house, who has been calling him a monkey all along. A few pages later, the same dynamic of subservience is played out between the householder and his boss at the Bank of India, aptly named Mr. England, whom he has invited to tea. The household does its utmost to impress the Englishman, who recoils in disgust at their food and cannot wait to leave. By the end of the scene, however, it is he who has been called "monkey-faced" by the highly educated Indian doctor who lives there.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The ironic stance of the narrative is such that only we as readers are aware of the many levels operating here; for Munoo, our eyes and ears, the visit of the Englishman is all spectacle. This scene highlights the layering of irony in the novel, which, like the rest of Anand's work, is too often simplified as a "social chronicle" (<i>HIL</i>, 177).

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>This scene also recalls, however, several episodes in <i>Portrait</i> in which the combination of a focalized perspective and a variety of competing discourses and power relationships serves to introduce irony into the serious subject of Bildung. First, the scene where Stephen is asked "Do you kiss your mother?" by the older fellows at school operates in much the same way to highlight a na&#x00EF;ve subject caught between multiple layers of discourse. As Trevor Williams comments, "the scene illustrates the crossover from linguistic innocence . . . to one in which words become charged with meaning depending upon one's position in the social group. The struggle for dominance, for the right to provide 'the right answer' is here engaged."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In this short scene, the power relationships are similar to those in <i>Coolie</i>: Stephen, not knowing the codes of conduct among the school boys, presents himself as eager and direct, which causes him trouble. He quickly answers "yes" when asked if he kisses his mother at night, reverses his answer, then succumbs to confusion not just about what the "right" answer is, but about the very meaning of the word "kiss." The fact that he asks "what did it mean to kiss?" indicates that he is outside the discourse of sexuality employed by the bigger boys (<i>P</i>, 11). They exert power by withholding this level of meaning from him. Yet we as readers know he is caught in an oedipal struggle here, and that the language of sexuality will become a crucial element in his development. Further, the power hierarchies at play here, while not overtly a matter of colonial status, nonetheless are significant and part of the broad structure of authority surrounding Stephen&#x2014;the boys are in positions of authority over him because they withhold the social and metaphorical meanings of kissing from him. As Williams makes clear, the rules of the "schoolboy fraternity" are "more open than the virtually unnoticed recruitment into the ideology of church and state . . . [yet] at the level of language the interpenetration is so complete as to seem natural."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  For Williams, this episode revolves around Stephen's becoming socialized into the male values of the school, which in turn are imbued with the languages of church and state. Then we can read this moment, and Stephen's inability to choose one answer or another, as the beginning of his trajectory toward exile at the end of the novel.  </p>

<p>Beyond that, however, we can see that the specific terms of the choice make less difference than Stephen's instruction in the vagaries of the performative. In this episode, Stephen is not in control of the way his performance is coded. Whatever words Stephen utters will be "wrong," and even worse is his vacillation from one to the other. What is required of Stephen at the moment is not an assertion of his meaning-making ability in language but the reverse&#x2014;his complete disavowal of the power to make meaning, and his performance, with his answer, of subservience to the other boys. Thus, the semiotic imperative, as it were, of the episode is not within the specifically linguistic realm. Like Munoo, who is unaware of what it means, socially, to play a monkey, Stephen does not know what social meaning attaches to the verbal performance of a kiss or how to respond to a question whose answer is always already known. In both novels, the withholding of this social level of meaning-making by those in authority is made a crucial component of the hero's coming of age and his insertion into power hierarchies.  </p>

<p>Stephen's visit with the Dean of Studies in <i>Portrait</i> is the scene most often discussed in terms of the question of coloniality in the novel, though it is surprising how infrequently

<b></b>

 <i>Portrait</i> res in the many treatments of Joyce and colonialism.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  In Derek Attridge and Marjorie Howe's excellent edited collection, <i>Semi-Colonial Joyce</i>, only Howe treats <i>Portrait </i>at any length.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Surely we have all been taught to see the complexity of the interchange about the word "tundish" between Stephen and the Dean of Studies. But the passage immediately preceding that, where Stephen discusses Newman's use of the word "detain" and confuses the dean, is equally interesting. Stephen here is the one in control of multiple levels of language, running verbal circles around the dean, and he is aware that in using them he is attempting to exert power. Stephen highlights John Henry Newman's particular use of the word "detain," which Newman takes from the version of Ecclesiasticus used as an antiphon in Catholic services.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The longer passage reads: "And so in Sion was I established, and in the holy city I likewise rested, and in Jerusalem was my power. And I took root in an honourable people, and in the glorious company of the saints was I detained. I was exalted like a cedar in Lebanus, and as a cypress in Mount Sion." The word "detain" here carries an unusually positive connotation that comes closer to the sense of being celebrated or embraced rather than hindered. Stephen refers to this as the use of the word according to the "literary tradition" rather than the "tradition of the marketplace." The dean misses Stephen's point on two levels, answering according to the "marketplace" use of the word ("not at all") when Stephen quotes the use of detain in the phrase "I hope I am not detaining you," and ignoring the "literary" reference to Newman (<i>P</i>, 164). In this short passage we can thus see Stephen not only lay claim to the literary tradition for himself but also demonstrate that the dean is completely outside it in the common world of the marketplace.  </p>

<p>Further, Newman's "Discourse" provides a deeper context for this discussion, which serves to extend its implications for Stephen's attempts to claim literary power. In the discourses on the Virgin Mary, Newman seeks to justify and promote the worship of the Virgin by gathering scripture that endorses her "tranquil influence" as a natural process and one devoid of challenge to the primacy of Jesus.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Much has been written about the many instances in <i>Portrait</i> where Stephen grapples with images of the Virgin Mary and with her worship, but none describe this as a tranquil process.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Mary and the Marian observances undergird the harsh piety of the retreat chapters in Section III where Stephen calls to "Mary refuge of sinners" to intercede for him and becomes a member of the sodality of the Blessed Lady (<i>P</i>, 115). As Christine Froula has pointed out, reference to the Annunciation also reappears frequently in <i>Portrait</i> (as in <i>Stephen Hero</i>), connected not only with Emma Cleary and Stephen's conflict over his desire for her, but also to Stephen himself in his role as artist. The language surrounding his creation of the villanelle&#x2014;" O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. Gabriel the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber"&#x2014;thus employs the Annunciation as a metaphor for Stephen's poetic inspiration even as it marks his conflict among religious duty, authorship, and desire (<i>P</i>, 188). If in invoking Newman's discourses on the Virgin Stephen demonstrates his command of the religious and literary tradition behind the word "detain," he is also demonstrating his ability to put this tradition to his own uses. The virgin who is promoted in the chapters that follow this 

<b></b>

scene is a "virgin . . . of the imagination" wherein the "word is made flesh," not the one of the previous sections who would force renunciation. Implicit in this short passage about the word "detain," then, is the expression of Stephen's effort to remake both literary and religious tradition to his own worldly purposes, which directly challenges the dean's authority. </p>

<p>This short section of <i>Portrait</i> also invokes the Newman subtext in its formal arrangement. The source of the word "detain" in Newman's Discourse is an unspecified antiphon that would have been used as part of the mass or in vespers. An antiphon (from "antiphonen": sounding against, responsive sound, singing opposite, alternate chant) is a liturgical chant sung in response to a psalm, often emphasizing in some manner the key meaning of that psalm.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Originally "the verse serving as the antiphon text would be repeated on an independent melody after every verse of the psalm" and sung by the congregation.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In later church practice it became customary to repeat it only once before and after the psalm. However many times it repeats, the antiphon must always be seen as an interplay between voices, or an alternate chant, which serves to highlight underlying meanings in the main text. If we turn to the page in <i>Portrait</i> where Stephen's conversation with the dean appears, we can see that the intercut dialogue between the two functions much like this kind of "alternate chant:"  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>The use of the term in the marketplace is quite different. <i>I hope I am not detaining you</i> <br />
&#x2014;Not in the least, said the dean politely. <br />
&#x2014;No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean . . . <br />
&#x2014;yes, yes: I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point: <i>detain</i>.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
[<i>P</i>, 164]
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The focus of emphasis here, unlike in a standard antiphon, seems not to be the particular meaning of a verse or speech but the absence of meaning in the conversation made salient by the confusion over the word "detain." Or, what emerges in this scene is Stephen's recognition of the dean's inadequacies and his own better command of the tradition. Thus, a form that is meant to highlight deep spiritual meanings in psalms, dissolves into empty repetition ("No, No . . . yes, yes") and wordplay that instead highlights the barrenness of what the dean can offer Stephen.  </p>

<p>Still any power gained by this word play is fleeting, as the familiar tundish scene that follows demonstrates. In that scene, the dean is ignorant of the word "tundish" which Stephen uses, in Irish fashion, to name a funnel used to fill a lamp. The dean seems innocently to want to acquire this new word, when Stephen recoils, remarking famously that "the language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine" (<i>P</i>, 166). But the word also comes to stand for the battle for authority between the dean and Stephen, in which Stephen must finally come out the loser. As Stephen thinks, "the little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe" (P,166). The possession of the meaning of the word does not confer power on Stephen here, since the word belonged to the English and after this conversation will, once again, belong to them. The ease with which the dean can expect Stephen to provide him with the definition and repossess it is the real story in this situation, and 

<b></b>

the source of the hurt Stephen suffers. In both the previous discussion about "detain" and this interlude concerning the tundish, Stephen must offer his knowledge and linguistic ability for the use of the (less gifted) dean, and even in resisting internally, must ultimately reinforce his own subservience. There is nothing he can say that will prevent this reenactment of power in this scene. Thus the profound lesson in coloniality here is not just about possession of the literary tradition or the power to control language (the: "it is his before it is mine"), but beyond that, the notion that among the colonized, real-world discursive authority trumps language play at all levels. In that sense, this scene is much like the one in Anand's <i>Coolie</i> where Mr. English is mocked and called a monkey, as we realize that no degree of verbal mockery, no matter how telling, will undermine the real world authority of a low-level Anglo bank official. In both of these novels, as I will discuss further, successful resistance requires the <i>rejection</i> of signification rather than its direct implementation or control, through the use of the extra-semiotic aspects of language such as sound, or what has been called the linguistic "remainder." </p>

<p>How do these episodes of disempowerment intersect with the representation of self-development in these novels? How can we understand the rejection of the direct power of signification within the tradition of the Bildungsroman to which, I argue, both of these writers are responding? In references to the history of the Bildungsroman Joyce's <i>Portrait </i>often appears as its twentieth-century apotheosis. As Buckley comments "Joyce sums up, even as he transforms, the traditions of the nineteenth-century Bildungsroman."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  This model of the novel of development is intimately tied to a sense of universalizable subjectivity and the notion of the hero as a representative man. Even Bakhtin, who makes Goethe's historicity and attention to location a key point in his discussion of the Bildungsroman, focuses on the notion of the emergence of the hero as "a new unprecedented human being" who has significance for the "historical future" writ large.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Moretti describes the goal of the Bildungsroman as the final synthesis of self and normative world into the "free individual of liberalism," a universal model of subjectivity and political citizenship.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  On the other hand, Hegel refers to the Bildungsroman as an inherently conservative genre, emphasizing the socialization of the hero rather than his continual individuation. Benjamin also considers the Bildungsroman to accomplish the justification of the social order that absorbs the hero.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  This seems to be the choice&#x2014;either individuation combined with a kind of exemplary status, or reincorporation&#x2014;but in both cases Bildung refers to an exemplary subject locked in a kind of discursive struggle with society. Presupposed are the separability of the two discursive positions, and the transparency of the subject's presentation in language, not to mention the function of narrative in advancing self-development.  </p>

<p>But it is not so clear that most twentieth-century Bildungsromane successfully accomplish even the primary goal of advancing self-development. According to Jed Esty, many modernist Bildungsromane have a surprisingly anti-teleological shape. Whether they describe characters like Woolf's Rachel Vinrace who, like Munoo in <i>Coolie,</i> dies before she can reach maturity, or others like Wilde's Dorian Grey who become caught in the time warp of endless youth (and we might certainly include Stephen Dedalus in 

<b></b>

that group), modernist Bildungsromane often subvert what seems to be the most salient component of the genre&#x2014;development&#x2014;even as they cling to its language, structure, process of characterization, and even ethical claims. Further, Esty also points out that in many of these anti-teleological Bildungsromane, what disrupts the development of the protagonists is often a colonial plot or setting. They "are anti-developmental fictions set in underdeveloped zones" that speak to us about the "connection between modernist aesthetics and modern colonialism."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Thus in most of the novels Esty studies, once the hero is positioned within or in relation to a colonial situation, the lack of development of the hero becomes intertwined with the failures of imperial politics. For Anand, whose entire oeuvre emerges out of the colonial context, there seems to be no possible alternative version of this story. The hero can not even dream of development. </p>

<p>Further, this question of the intrusion of imperialist politics into the Bildungsroman tradition disrupts it in more ways. To be sure the Bildungsroman emerges alongside the development of Enlightenment liberalism, it coincides with and contributes to the development of modern versions of nationality, and its heroes can often be seen to stand as heroic emblems of their nations. Bakhtin phrases it differently, writing of Goethe: "his creative imagination is also restricted and subordinated to the <i>necessity</i> of a given locality, the iron-clad logic of its historical and geographical existence."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The intrusion of the imperial or colonial situation into the tradition, then, serves to interrupt not only the Bildungsroman itself but also the model of the nation that is red there. Esty asserts, </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Colonial modernity unsettles the discourse of national culture by breaking up its cherished continuities linking a people to its language, its territory, and its political history. It is not just the accelerating pace of economic and technological change that has this effect, nor even the values conflict between, for example, Britain's liberal heritage and the New Imperialism, but also &#x2014; and more directly to the narratological point &#x2014; it is that imperialism brings the Bildungsroman and its humanist ideals into the zone of uneven development, breaking the Goethean bond between biographical and "national-historical time".<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Said and others have made clear that imperialism develops alongside modernity and the modern nation-state&#x2014;it is not a later addition. What changes with the turn to the twentieth century is the possibility of thinking about the nation overtly in relation to empire, and, for some, of imagining a postcolonial world. But in many ways this new possibility runs contrary to what is necessary to sustain national identity. When Ernst Renan, at the end of the nineteenth century, claims that what holds a nation together is not language, territory, or common experiences, but rather its will to unity and its ability to forget what has divided it in the past, he is thinking of historical events, like the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre in France, that pitted neighbor against neighbor. If we think about the 1920s and 1930s in Europe, I would argue, what occupies this crucial role of national forgetting is a kind of collective determination to overlook the role of the colonies in shoring up national unity and to ignore the constant possibility of the fall of the Empire (and thus the Imperial nation). For the growing national movement in India the question might be reversed, but no less intertwined with the question of 

<b></b>

empire. National identity in a former colony might be imaginatively constructed as "the absence of imperialism," and yet in the twentieth century it by necessity develops directly in response to empire.  </p>

<p>We also see here very clearly how a transnational perspective, especially one that moves our focus to the question of empire and colonialism, adjusts our understanding of modernism. Where critics looking only from within the European tradition might debate the success or failure of various twentieth century Bildungsromane, like <i>The Voyage Out</i> or <i>Portrait,</i> based upon the traditional form of the genre, from a transnational viewpoint we might see these European novels as raising concerns that are only made overt in the work of those like Anand. If <i>Portrait</i> leaves Stephen at what critics have seen as a moment well before maturity (and we may disagree about how mature he is even as he enters <i>Ulysses</i>), <i>Coolie </i>cuts its hero down in his mid-teens. Perhaps then <i>Coolie </i>is teaching us a lesson about how to read <i>Portrait</i>. The imbrication of nation and biography within a Bildungsroman set in a colony struggling for its independence ensures that the biography can not go far. The demands of the Bildungsroman tradition for a hero who emerges along with the epochal transition of the world around him are necessarily thwarted. The politics of the Bildungsroman in this place and time must be one of disruption, disillusionment and dislocation, even as we begin to glimpse the possibility of another kind of story. Thus, reading Anand into the body of modernism rather than as its appendage, mirror, or mime, means that the heroism of a coolie who suffers every conceivable setback on his road to maturity, even while becoming a spokesman for a grassroots movement of rebellion before his death at an early age, ought be seen as a model of modernist engagement with the consequences of Enlightenment historicism and the Bildungsroman. </p>

<p>Further, in neither <i>Portrait </i>nor <i>Coolie,</i> I would argue, are the main characters presented as either "free individual subjects of liberalism" or isolated heroes who become reincorporated into social life at the end of the novel. Breon Mitchell claims that in <i>Portrait</i> concrete separation of the hero from society, as in earlier Bildungsromane, gives way to "unbridgeable spiritual distance."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  And yet, we see in Stephen's interior musings, in his interaction with others, and even in his focalization of the narrative, the constant appearance of other voices and concerns that always surround his moments of isolation or distance and interrupt his reverie. Munoo in <i>Coolie</i> is even more contained within a communal discursive world, but one that keeps shifting as his social context changes: He can neither be separate nor, because of his class, his hill background, or his growing political awareness, become incorporated into the social world around him. Because both of these characters are from beginning to end implicated within multivocal, socially-constructed identities, and within various hierarchies of discursive power that are often treated ironically, they can neither be absorbed in nor escape the social realm and so cannot accomplish the traditional project of Bildung. </p>

<p>In <i>Portrait</i> we can see this linguistic embeddedness easily in the beginning and the end of the novel. The opening pages quickly demonstrate this structure: "Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road." Whose voice are we hearing? How is it presented to us? Whether understood as a direct 

<b></b>

transcription of the father's voice telling the young Stephen a story, the story told in indirect discourse through the main narrator's perspective, or a recasting of an oft-told story in the young Stephen's voice, we can see that Stephen's voice at this moment is inseparable from his father's. And even as we continue: "his father told him that story; his father looked at him through a glass; he had a hairy face," narrative perspectives merge (<i>P</i>, 6). We are also being told this story by a narrative voice focalized through Stephen and must struggle as does he, to distinguish self from other, son from father refracted through the glass, as if through a Lacanian specular image turned outward. We know from John James's letter to his son (Jan. 31, 1931) that this was a story Joyce heard from his father, and we also know that it was a version of an Irish myth.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Thus in beginning Stephen Dedalus's story of development with this tale, Joyce inserts him into a narrative matrix that immediately widens from the specific and personal (Simon Dedalus speaking to Stephen) to the cultural and mythic. Given that the status of the founding mythologies of Irish culture is precisely what is at stake in the Irish struggle against colonial rule, this moment also begins the novel's constant engagement with anticolonial struggle and the pitfalls of national consciousness.  </p>

<p>This same overdetermined social embeddedness appears at the end of the novel, where the diary represents the collapse of the appearance of narrative unity into the assemblage of its parts and voices. Within the space of five pages we read quotations from Blake and Yeats, references to Dante, Shakespeare, and the Bible, transcriptions of conversations with Davin, Cranly, and others, as well as moments where Stephen appears to be speaking to himself. "O, give it up old chap! Sleep it off!" he tells himself, voicing what many readers also wish they could tell Stephen in his final moment of self-aggrandizement. At no other time in the novel is it so apparent that Stephen's narrative is a conversation of many voices, dialogic in the most profound meaning of the term. These dialogic and deeply ironized final sections indicate that the narrative does not support Stephen's belief that he can retreat into a personal aesthetics, or into a way of understanding his place in the world separate from those around him. If he says to Cranly that he does not fear to be alone, he demonstrates a near addiction to conversation (<i>P</i>, 208). His claim to "silence, exile, and cunning" is of course spoken aloud and his talk of exile fraught with the potential (and the knowledge, once we have begun <i>Ulysses</i>) that it will be impermanent. The end of <i>Portrait</i> signifies neither the hero's triumph, maturation, nor his reincorporation into society; but rather the explosion of the conventional Bildungsroman along with its enforcement of liberal subjectivity, its insistence on a unified perspective, and its insistence on language as a transparent expression of that perspective. </p>

<p>Further, what replaces the "fusion of the liberal subject" in Joyce's novel is not the universal representative man but something more like what Hannah Arendt has called "enlarged thinking"&#x2014;that which moves us from an isolated individualized perspective to one always cognizant of its place among others." This perspective is in some respects akin to a Levinasian being-towards-the-others, yet importantly for Arendt (as opposed to Levinas), it also makes the transition from ethics to politics, moving concern from an abstracted or internal attitude about what ought to be towards a matter of engagement

<b></b>

 with what might be for an actual polity. Thus Arendt's notion helps to highlight relations among subjectivity, discourse and politics in Joyce and Anand. Arendt argues that, though we agree that morality concerns our conduct towards others, philosophers (Levinas notwithstanding) continually present moral maxims in terms of what they indicate about the self's relationship to itself, and not to public or social realms. Yet, as she argues, "I am only with my own self or the self of another when I am thinking, whereas I am in the company of the many when I start to act. Power for human beings . . . can only reside in one of the many forms of plurality."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  If we follow Arendt this far, we meet an impasse, and a predictable one at that. Morality, or ethics, opposes politics; thought seems to differ in kind from action, and these are dichotomies that appear final and compelling.  </p>

<p>However in another essay, Arendt describes the way that we engage in ethical thought: "we judge and tell right from wrong by having present in our mind some incident and some person, . . . that have become examples . . . our decisions about right and wrong will depend upon our choice of company, of those with whom we wish to spend our lives" (ibid, 145). The dichotomy weakens: we begin to reason morally by entering into company with others, expanding the realm of our thinking from the self or other, to the several. The leap to politics and to action is then one of degree rather than of order, from the one to the several, and finally to the realm of a social collectivity.  </p>

<p>There are moments in Kant where we can see the potential for this sort of a connection between ethics and politics by way of the collectivity, most notably in the section on the Doctrine of Right in the <i>Metaphysics of Morals</i>. Kant there argues for the primacy of communal possession of land, and therefore for the community as the origin of the right to property. "<i>A right to a thing</i> is a right to the private use of a thing of which I am in (original or instituted) possession in common with all others."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The individual's right to use an object must derive from the community's possession of it for Kant, because there is no other way to derive the possibility of an individual possessing something outside itself. Thus a quality ascribed to the universal individual comes to that individual from society and not the other way around. This is the basis of all the other rights described in the Doctrine of Right, which has been used by theorists like John Rawls as a basis for political notions of justice. If we presume with Arendt that we are in some control of our associations beyond the family, creating our own communities, then the very process of associating with others becomes a constitutive process of the doctrine of rights.  </p>

<p>Arendt also foregrounds the notion of the company we keep, or the community we join, as one created in part by the models, real or fictional, that come into our minds and are perpetuated by the dialogue we carry out with that imagined company. This way of describing ethics makes clear that in order to exert power in the world, or to <i>move</i> from ethics to politics, one would not only strive toward being otherwise, as Levinas suggests, but also seek to create in the world a version of ethical company or community. Thus Kant's <i>sensus communis</i>&#x2014;the "sense that fits us into a community with others, makes us members of it, and enables us to communicate things"&#x2014;becomes a call to political action, a call to create a community where we can communicate our ethical positions and where they matter (<i>RJ</i>, 139). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>But what does this say to the question of universality and the representative man? Certainly the notion of a social or political world surrounding the ethical subject does not work against the aspiration to universality in Kant, or in most post-Enlightenment ethical thought. On the other hand, once we begin to consider with Kant the claims upon a self of a specific right held by another, or the "judging and talking" that Hegel argues are the activities of selves in contact with others in the world, then the absolute wholeness of the subject and its ability to stand in for any other become diminished.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  If, in Hegel's terms, the consciousness is placed into a position of subservience to the state (as embodied in an individual), then it will be virtuous conduct on the part of that consciousness to obey&#x2014;to sacrifice "the single individual to the universal."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  In other words, the situation of being in the world and among other people, for both of these thinkers (as in a different manner for Arendt), introduces specific dynamics of power and reciprocity and challenges the absolute universality of the representative man. Being among others, even as imagined in a fantasy conversation within a narrative, puts in motion a specific instantiation of ethical conduct, which brings with it the potential for politics.  </p>

<p>For Arendt, narrative also helps us move from this "enlarged" way of thinking to a potentially active political engagement with others. She will emphasize that the company with whom we spend our lives are chosen from examples both real and fictional, and that we think through dilemmas in a form of dialogic narrative.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  These are distinctly literary ways of linking ethics to politics; not only does Arendt begin from imagined situations and characters, but she progresses through storytelling and the narrative creation of a community of interlocutors all the way to direct political action. The result is a conception of engagement that acknowledges the role of fiction in the creation of social identities and that assumes dialogic narrative as one of its primary modes.  </p>

<p>Arendt's linked conceptions of enlarged thinking and engagement thus hold profound implications for understanding the potential modes of social engagement in experimental fiction. For example, what might be seen as the failure of the Bildungsroman in <i>Portrait </i>might instead be read as its entrance into politics, where the question of just how self and community are implicated in each other overrides the possibility of Stephen's reincorporation into his social world. Further, politics becomes here clearly a narrative matter, where the breakdown of narrative self-certainty and coherence also connotes the breakdown of the conception of the representative man with his aspirations to universality. Joyce's experimentation with focalized perspective, with the problem of language and its potential as at once a form of social control and its undoing, and with the matter of Stephen as decentered subject, all ask us to think politically about Stephen's relationship to his community, and to revise our notions about both the conservative force of Bildung and the moral power of the singular, representative man.  </p>

<p>The same dynamic is much more obviously true of Munoo in <i>Coolie</i> who never has the potential to aspire to universality or self-completeness, and whose failure to mature as in a proper Bildungsroman is even more starkly drawn than in <i>Portrait</i>. If Anand has given us an ordinary hero to follow on his journey towards death at the end of the novel, his title <i>Coolie</i> makes clear (as in the earlier novel <i>Untouchable</i>) that he is one of a class of individuals rather than an exemplary re. Once again, the political

<b></b>

 engagement of the novel begins with this critique of the Bildungsroman tradition, because we know that the colonial power hierarchies and discourses surrounding Munoo prevent him from ever approaching the possibility of civic citizenship. But that he nonetheless commands our attention and compassion, and eventually rises in the climax of the novel to direct political engagement as a member of a worker's action, also means that the novel has proposed an alternate logic of politics and selfhood, one based in nonuniversalized subjectivity and enlarged thinking, which we can also use for reading Joyce.  </p>

<p>The matter of the uncontrollability of words and the impossibility of restricting their meaning, even within the multiple power hierarchies surrounding them, plays a crucial role in this alternative political logic for both Joyce and Anand. Certainly, it is clear that at the textual level language itself often escapes limitation to strict meaning-making and operates by other principles. This is what Derrick Attridge, echoing Derrida, has identified in the Joycean context as "the remainder, that aspect of language's functioning, which in spite of its necessity is often repressed from our consciousness."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Sound often takes the place of semiotics as the focus of language use, with the result that another level of play complicates the social terrain our heroes must traverse. Of course Joyce is notorious for this&#x2014;though it is more often remarked in his later work. But as Attridge points out, there are many moments in <i>Portrait</i> where nonsense, or repetition, or rhythm and melody emerge.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  From the "tra, la la" on page one, to "Apologize put out his eyes," to the repetition of "stephaneforus" later in the novel, the musicality of pure syllables plays an important role in presenting what escapes Stephen's attempts to control his own development, thus furthering Joyce's critique of Bildung. He asks himself the question: "Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words far better than their associations?" but we know that whichever way he answers, <i>both</i> realms of language determine the character Stephen and his text (<i>P</i>, 140).  </p>

<p>This is precisely what Anand responds to in pointing out the musicality of Joyce's language as an important element that connects them. For Anand "the sound of the words dictating sense" in Joyce's writing was like his "mother's mumbo-jumbo prayers" (<i>CB</i>, 7). We know from Anand's autobiography that this was not a criticism, since he loved listening to his mother's Sikh prayers, which were in a language he didn't understand. So, when the first three paragraphs of <i>Coolie</i> each begin with the repeated utterance of a version of its hero's name "Munoo ohe Munooa oh Mundo," turned into a musical mantra, much like the schoolboys' shouts of "stephaneforus" in <i>Portrait</i>, we know that we are being asked to attend to "remainder," to the level of language use that escapes semiotics and the control of the user, and that can confuse or resist conventional discursive authorities.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  These kinds of moments appear regularly throughout <i>Coolie</i>&#x2014;indeed more frequently than in <i>Portrait</i>. Sometimes it is in the form of a cry of fear or surprise uttered by Munoo as he is accosted or derided; other times it is in the form of a string of abuse ("ohe you seducer of your daughter!"; "you illegally begotten . . . you son of a pig") that is not meant to be interpreted literally (<i>C</i>, 143, 154). Still other times it is the rhythmic repetition of syllables or sounds, which add extra dimension to the connotative power of speech. It becomes, however, directly 

<b></b>

political in the climactic scene when the union leader Sauda exhorts the factory workers to strike, and the crowd calls back "Shabash! Shabash! Sauda Sahib!" (Bravo! Bravo! Sir Sauda!) (<i>P</i>, 260). Here the political importance of linguistic remainder emerges as the workers begin to take on force through their appropriation of a mode of meaning-making not within the purview of conventional systems of discursive power. This speech is in many ways the climax of the novel and one of its most moving moments, as we sense the potential for collective action among the disenfranchised crowds and see Munoo rise to real engagement. Despite the fact that the authorities successfully break up the strike by pitting Hindus against Muslims, it unites the workers&#x2014;or more broadly speaking, the coolies&#x2014;as possessors of the remainder: of play, of the power of language outside the bounds of authority, and of layers of meaning not glimpsed by their British and Indian overlords.  </p>

<p>The unusual quality of language in Anand's fiction has also been marked as crucial to the development of Indian writing in English and its representation of India's linguistic diversity. As Feroza Jussawalla points out, in the 1930s and 1940s the question of what kind of language might best be used to represent Indian experience in literature becomes a crucial subject of debate.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Critics take R. K. Narayan to task, for example, for using English almost exclusively, especially when at times his English seems either stilted or impoverished (<i>FQ</i>, 70&#x2013;5). Others defend the unusual syntax or vocabulary in Narayan's work as an effort at representing Tamil speech patterns within an English language narrative. As one critic maintains, "Narayan's novels are so satisfyingly Indian perhaps because they are so authentically South Indian . . . through skillful use of the English language he delineates people whose actions, behaviour, and responses are shaped by a language different from English" (qtd. in <i>FQ</i>, 74).  </p>

<p>Anand, on the other hand, in those moments of nonliteral meaning-making and emergence of the remainder, also takes a significant step toward the incorporation of local languages and habits of speech into English language writing. At times he attempts to translate Hindi and Punjabi phrases into English; at other moments what emerges is a representation of the sound of that language in English, without concern for its absolute intelligibility. In his words, </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I found, while writing spontaneously, that I was always translating dialogue from the original Punjabi into English. The way in which my mother said something in the dialect of Central Punjab could not have been expressed in any other way except in an almost literal translation, which might carry over the sound and sense of the original speech. </p>

	<div class="attrib">
[qtd. in <i>FQ</i>, 84]
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">At other times Anand will mix the two languages, putting snippets of English within a Hindi phrase or vice versa. He incorporates new coinages without apology, arguing in his essay, "Pigeon-Indian: Some Notes on Indian Writing in English," that the real everyday use of a combined language, whether it is transparent in meaning or not, ought to be represented in the fiction that emerges out of India.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Anand's resistance to verbal transparency and his synthesis of more than one language often prompts critics to praise his attempts at mimetic realism and verisimilitude. 

<b></b>

Feroza Jussawalla, whose book <i>Family Quarrels</i> focuses a chapter on this question, argues strongly for the appropriateness of Anand's revisions of English. Still, she feels the need to cite linguists who endorse the linguistic combinations in Anand's novels as accurate. Other critics simply note that "although awkward" Anand's novels " are pioneering in their attempt to render into English the exuberant dialects of Northern India" (<i>HIL</i>, 179). On the other hand, I would argue that reading Anand from a transnational perspective, and in light of Joyce, makes clear the inadequacy of describing these quasi-Hindi, quasi-English moments in Anand purely in terms of verisimilitude. However important they may be to the development of a new vernacular in India, they are equally crucial as moments of disruption and play. If the new "pigeon-English" of the Coolie or the Untouchable cannot be assimilated into either the standard English of Empire or the Hindi of a caste-conscious India, then it contains the possibility of resistance to both. This neither/nor language provides the moment of potential power for those shut out of conventional hierarchies, since it creates its own system of signification. This language use also points the way out of Stephen's conundrum regarding the dean's use of the words "detain" and "tundish," for a newly developed syncretic language can never be called "his before it is mine," nor will it always succumb to the possessor of power over the marketplace tradition.  </p>

<p>Thus, this use of language&#x2014;of style, if you will&#x2014;carries heavy political and social weight here. It belies the truism that engaged writing lacks interest in stylistics and that political novels tend toward stripped-down realism. It also expands the political dimension of our understanding of style in both <i>Coolie </i>and<i> Portrait</i>. What escapes control in Anand's novel is Munoo, his name, what he stands for, the Coolie, the orphan nation, just as Stephen escapes his definition not only by family, religion, and Ireland but also within the rubric of the representative man. If we see Anand's <i>Coolie</i> as very definitely and dramatically an anticolonial novel because it musters the forces of a revised model of Bildung to the side of an orphaned laborer; because it insists on material reality and not the mystical or religious realm as the scene of self-development and enlarged thinking; and because it presents the many layers of discourse, within a highly-focalized novel, as still leaving a remainder that might be the domain of the disenfranchised; then we might also read those elements, which Anand saw and admired in Joyce's <i>Portrait</i>, as important to political struggle. Reading Joyce and Anand together from a transnational, comparative perspective helps bring Anand to the center of the conversation about modernist experimentation and its connection to politics and makes a case for his work as a constitutive element of international modernism. Reading Joyce and Anand together also forces us to see the "cross-cultural, intertextual" fabric of anticolonial writing in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as its use of linguistic remainder to escape the dominance of the colonial powers over everyday language use. We are thus encouraged to look beyond the words in <i>Portrait</i> "I go . . . to forge in the smithy of my soul . . ." to see a political struggle for discursive authority that brings Stephen, Munoo, and us as readers, into the realm of enlarged thinking and political engagement.

<p><a name="FOOT45" href="#REF45">45</a>. Here we might also think about the recurring chant of "esmiss esmoor" at the end of the trial chapter of Forster's <i>Passage to India</i> (New York: Harbrace, 1924), 225. At that point in the novel the proper name "Mrs. Moore" gets transformed into a similar kind of non-literal maker, which takes on a political meaning not contained in its ordinary use. We can code this as a remainder, since for most 

<b></b>

of the people chanting in the streets "esmiss esmoor" is pure musicality, and has no real connection to Mrs. Moore herself. And yet it does not serve quite the same function in Forster's novel as does remainder in Anand's since the use of the name of Mrs. Moore does clearly invoke the position she has taken in the chapters surrounding the trial. Of course, since the novel emerges mainly out of the perspective of the British characters, the use of this chant is also caught up with the orientalist sense of Indian "mystery" that surrounds the caves and other native elements. If the Malabar Caves are a floating signifier that can be coded in many different ways depending on context and perspective, so can "esmiss esmoor." This gives it power primarily as the "other" of rational language use, and not as a true alternative to it. </p>

<p id="lead">Early in her novel <i>Jacob's Room</i>, Virginia Woolf makes us privy to a suggestively erotic scene between two men, and in the process she signals her interest in a certain dimension of British history. The title character Jacob Flanders and his friend Will Durrant read Shakespeare and eat lunch together as they sail to the Scilly Isles to visit Durrant's family: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[Timmy Durrant] with a sprout of beard, looking sternly at the stars, then at a compass, would have moved a woman. Jacob, of course, was not a woman. The sight of Timmy Durrant was no sight for him, nothing to set against the sky and worship; far from it. They had quarreled. Why the right way to open a tin of beef, with Shakespeare on board, under conditions of such splendour, should have turned them to sulky schoolboys, none can tell ships have been wrecked here.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Although "none can tell" why two young men might become sulky in a scene presided over by Shakespeare (whom Jacob places even above the Greeks, and Richard Dalloway in Woolf's next novel deplores for his sonnets that invite us to peep through keyholes), and although Woolf's narrator doth protest (too much) about the possibility that Jacob could be moved by the sight of Durrant, most twenty-first-century readers would detect the gay codes (as a circle of Woolf's contemporaries undoubtedly did). Woolf more broadly hints at her gay subtext when she has Jacob undress, swim, and bathe "naked" at the very moment when Shakespeare is knocked overboard, "floating merrily away . . . he went under" (<i>JR</i>, 39). The narrator ends her description with 

<b></b>

a vision of "waves breaking unseen by anyone" and the whole bay rising "to heaven in a kind of ecstasy" (ibid.).  </p>

<p>The ecstasy is, however, quickly followed by (post-coital?) sorrow, so that "the cottage smoke droops, [and] has the look of a mourning emblem, a flag floating its caress over a grave" (ibid.). In Greece, the narrator notes, this "sadness would be routed by strangeness and excitement and the nudge of a classical education,"&#x2014;in other words, a community of male intimacy&#x2014;but on the Cornish hills, "the chimneys and the coast-guard stations and the little bays with waves breaking unseen by anyone make one remember the overpowering sorrow." "And what can this sorrow be?" the narrator asks. And then answers: "It comes from the houses on the coast. We start transparent, and then the cloud thickens. All history backs our panes of glass. To escape is vain" (<i>JR</i>, 40). </p>

<p>What is this history that clouds the panes of glass and saddens the swimmer? One answer would of course be the legacy of all manner of gendered cruelty.  </p>

<p>Yet Woolf gives us clues to another, closely related history at the heart of this passage: Atlantic history. It is no coincidence, I will argue, that this is a boat scene, a sea-crossing associated with wrecked ships, the sorrow of which is particularly evoked by coast-guard stations and little bays and waves breaking unseen by anyone&#x2014;which make one "remember" a sad history. Woolf understands that this history is a long, transnational history, full of perilous sea crossings that often entail a sexual crisis or ruin.  </p>

<p>A striking number of English-language modernist writers likewise situate their stories of sexual or gender trouble within a transnational, Atlantic history. Here I will ultimately focus on Nella Larsen and Virginia Woolf as two authors who typify this pattern among a number of English-language modernists&#x2014;such as Rhys, McKay, Stein, Hurston, Forster, and Hemingway, to name a few&#x2014;whom I will call Atlantic modernists and understand as one kind of geomodernist.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  It is by now a commonplace that modernism probes the formation of the social subject, using literary form to expose or rearrange the subject's social coordinates. For these writers, Atlantic and transnational history provides one crucial set of such coordinates, a historical set. Indeed, attention to the Atlantic dimension of their work may allow us to do fuller justice to the historical consciousness of modernist writers, so long decried as being altogether absent. For my purposes here, however, I will emphasize how their fiction asks us to think more historically about transnationalism, especially in relation to its liberatory possibilities for social identity.  </p>

<p>For transnationalism (as a phenomenon, not a field of inquiry) has a long, complicated history. It's nothing new. Attention to its history makes clear that transnationalism has not simply traveled transversely or fugitively across the borders of nationalism. Rather, in Atlantic modernity at least, transnationalism and nationalism have since the seventeenth century arisen together and unfolded dialectically. Their frictions have catalyzed their further instantiations. Some transnational scholarship assumes a sequence in which nations come first and then transnational migrations, economies, and impulses move across and against these national boundaries. This work has usefully tracked the ways that, since the early twentieth century, transnational movements, especially in conjunction with decolonization, have troubled global, top-down centralization by way of border-crossing alliances and identities working "from below" and laterally.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>But historically and economically over the past four centuries, many nations have taken shape exactly by way of such centrifugal migrations, even if, ideologically, nationalist discourses have simultaneously spoken past or against them. On the Atlantic, transnational dispersions (at first, transatlantic proto-national dispersions) created the new circuits of wealth that built the Anglo-European nations, fostered a sense of bold, free movement for those who were not slaves or bondspersons, and at the same time bred fervent, distended, and nostalgiac ties to something that came to be called nationality. This, at least, is what we find in the case of those transnationalisms that began to form in the sixteenth century with Spanish and Portuguese projects on the Atlantic, later extended by the Dutch, French, English, and Germans. As we will see, this history suggests a supplement to Benedict Anderson's account of nationalism. Atlantic transnationalism makes clear that nations are not only formed centripetally around a common language and a print-sphere culture, as Anderson has so richly established.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The nation's "imaginary" centripality and insistence on commonality (even across oceans) arises, at least in part, under centrifugal, transnational pressures&#x2014;economic, political, and psychosocial.  </p>

<p>Such an account also clarifies how Atlantic transnationalisms emerge together with what Walter Mignolo calls the "modern/colonial border."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Mignolo's formulation is useful for the way it moves us even further from positioning modernity as the founding central term&#x2014;as we do even when we speak of Anglo-European modernity arising through <i>its</i> dependence on colonial violence, forced labor, and the resulting capital wealth. Even in this latter kind of formulation, modernity comes first (not to mention Anglo-Europeans), while coloniality provides its support system. Mignolo leads us to speak always of modernity/coloniality, in one breath, as one body, although with a slash through it. Even in acknowledging their meeting as a cut, modernity/coloniality holds histories together. The phrase helps to turn the either/or of, for instance, modern/primitive cultures, into the always-both-at-once of all travelling, modern/colonial materials: money, commodities, subjectivities, theories, and texts, the very transnational movement of which profits those living on the modern side of the slash. In world-system terms, the construction modernity/coloniality establishes the dialectical and contingent unfolding of each side of the pair&#x2014;economically, politically, technologically, militarily&#x2014;and it therefore allows us better to tell the story of an "uneven" unfolding. The unevenness is not merely territorial, of course&#x2014;here progress, there stagnation&#x2014;but rather matrixial and generative&#x2014;underdevelopment here <i>fosters</i> development there. And sexuality is conscripted to reproduce this matrix, under a racial and heteronormative logic: "our" women couple with "our" men, and "your" women with "your" men, to reproduce "our" race and "your" race&#x2014;and, in turn, the uneven order of things. In coloniality/modernity, this racial order cuts horizontally across national boundaries, at once stratifying the nation and lending it a transnational reach.  </p>

<p>With Mignolo in mind, then, <i>we can understand transnationalism as the shuttling activity through which nations have emerged under the episteme of modernity/coloniality and as reproduced by its racial and sexual ordering</i>. Stipulated in this way, transnationalism is structurally and dialectically implicated in nationalism. It <i>may </i>also 

<b></b>

be the historical ground of a contemporary, perhaps potentially more transgressive or equalizing transnationalism. In some of her novels Woolf hints at this possibility (in the queerly Chinese-eyed, yet English Lily Briscoe, for instance), whereas Larsen tends to represent its foreclosure. But in any case, the work of such Atlantic modernists indicates that we best judge the transformative possibilities of twenty-first-century transnationalism (in which the "trans" is not disavowed or subordinated) only when we discern in it the traces of this transnational history.  </p>

<p>Ignoring this historical legacy, we are tempted to distinguish neatly between liberatory and conservative transnationalisms&#x2014;between top-down, imperialist capitalism on the one hand, and bottom-up, mestiza, or cosmopolitan subversions on the other. Likewise, without this long history in mind, we might tend to associate racial ideology strictly with the organically-imaged nation and so cast the transnational as that which necessarily generates hybridity or border-identity or horizontal coalitions, in the process demystifying nativist notions of "peoples." But in English-language Atlantic modernity, at the least, notions of race and transnational movement across boundaries emerged together.  </p>

<p>On the English-language Atlantic, in fact, it is exactly race that has provided the motor and logic for a <i>liberationist</i> history, in turn authorizing the transnational reach of an Anglo-European modernity/coloniality, and persisting, in the twenty-first century, as a rallying trope for transnational communities. In the first part of this essay, I will sketch (as I have elsewhere) the ways that, since the seventeenth century, the idea of an inherited, native, <i>racialized</i> will to liberty has often authorized and propelled those apparent transgressions we are lately calling transnational. As part of the long back-story to Atlantic transnationalism and to the English-language modernism that further illustrated and troubled it, I analyze the crucial early decades of the seventeenth century in England, as England became a successful Atlantic presence. In these years, the English Civil War, culminating in the beheading of Charles I, issued not only in a strong, Atlantic colonial turn in English history but also in the concurrent fashioning of a new racial identity for English people, as free Anglo-Saxons.  </p>

<p>As with the Atlantic ventures of Spain and Portugal, these events both issued from and further constituted an emergent modernity/coloniality. Englishmen pursued their own "free," transnational future lived, at once profitably and dissentingly, under the sign of a nativist "birthright." Anglo-Atlantic women, too, laid claim to this birthright, which authorized their freer movement within transnational Atlantic circuits. Via this race-liberty logic, the very dissent, revolution, and violence that drove "a people" to behead its king and travel across an ocean also provided exhibit A for its members' racial kinship with each other, the homeland, and the past. The conjunction of race and liberty, as I argue here and in the longer project from which this essay is drawn, has provided an ideological formation that authorizes transnational movement even while racializing and nationalizing it; and this movement, conversely, accrues both economic and cultural capital <i>to</i> the nation.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Slave revolts and postcolonial revolutions have, in the name of an indigenous liberty, turned this logic back on the colonizer, but meanwhile have also participated in the racialization of liberty&#x2014;for that racialization has come to be a <i>condition</i> of their liberation.

 </p>

<p>Within this context, we can begin to see the extent to which English-language literature, including both African-Atlantic and Anglo-Atlantic writers, is a transnational literature, beginning in the later sixteenth century. In particular, as I will lay out in the middle of this essay, we can see with sudden clarity how the English-language novel forms around the story of a transnational and traumatic crossing, an Atlantic story of ruin and freedom, often written as a plot of sexual ruin or crisis, like Jacob Flanders's. Via this transnational and transatlantic narrative structure, furthermore, African-Atlantic and Anglo-Atlantic writers have engaged in a centuries-long dialectic, casting and recasting the violent "crossing" of Atlantic coloniality/modernity.  </p>

<p>Putting Anglo- and African-Atlantic stories side-by-side in this way, we can articulate one kind of answer to Paul Gilroy's call in <i>Black Atlantic </i>to "take the Atlantic as one single, complex unit of analysis" and "use it to produce an explicitly transnational and intercultural perspective"&#x2014;one which however foregrounds the ways that the national and racial are embedded in the transnational, and vice-versa.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Those writers I call Atlantic modernists look back on this vexed Atlantic legacy, as I will argue in the final third of the essay via discussion of Larsen and Woolf. They trouble its narrative uplift toward the telos of race-liberty, and they enact a queer undoing of its transnational force.  </p>

How Freedom Became a Race Ideology
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>During the English Civil War, race unfurled as a freedom myth. Consider Englishman John Hare's revolution-defending pamphlet, <i>St Edward's Ghost or Anti-Normanism</i> : </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is no man that understands rightly what an Englishman is, but knows withal, that we are a member of the Teutonick nation, and descended out of Germany: a descent so honourable and happy, if duly considered, as that the like could not have been fetched from any other part of Europe . . . in England the whole commonalty, are German, and of the German blood; and scarcely was there any worth or manhood left in these occidental nations, after their long servitude under the Roman yoke, until these new supplies of freeborn men from Germany reinfused the same . . . Did our ancestors, therefore, shake off the Roman yoke . . . that the honour and freedom of their blood might be reserved for an untainted prey to a future conqueror?"<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Hare joins many others who yoke freedom and race in an Anglo-Saxon discourse of resistance to conquerors and tyranny. Over the next century, this discourse produced the notion that some races are born to seek freedom&#x2014;and therefore deserve it&#x2014;and others are not. By the later eighteenth century and until today in Iraq, peoples or races must, from a western point of view, demonstrate "their capacity" for freedom, or be ruined. In the western idea of freedom, race and modernity thus join hands, for the will to freedom is the very essence and driving force, according to G. W. F. Hegel and others, of modern world-history, a force actualized by "world-historical" races. As developed in these discourses, in modernity it is above all the capacity for freedom that measures a race.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Yet it is important that we recognize the seventeenth-century rhetoric not just as the seedbed for slavery, Nazism, and Anglo-European or American imperialism but also as the postcolonial revolutionary resistance it was intended to be. The early speakers of the paired discourses of race and freedom understood themselves to be reclaiming their trammeled native rights from foreign usurpers&#x2014;Norman, French, and popish. However imaginary, theirs was a postcolonial discourse.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Only when we recognize this old and dissenting genealogy of race and freedom do we understand fully the seductive power and social dynamics of race, especially its constitutive role in the modernity/coloniality dynamic running through nearly all circuits of transnationalism. At the same time, as we attend to this genealogy, we begin to glimpse the depth at which English-language narratives are racial narratives precisely to the degree that they are structured by a freedom plot.  </p>

<p>It was first of all the Reformation that gave rise to this new protoracial and Saxonist refashioning of English identity. The Anglo-Protestant search for links to the "primitive" German church predating Christianity's Roman Catholic dependence on bishops and popes initiated the turn toward an Anglo-Saxon lineage that would eventually become insistently racialized.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Thus Henry VIII authorized Matthew Parker to gather from England and abroad all documents revealing the Germanic and Anglo-Saxon origins of the "true and primitive" Church that predated popery (<i>OES</i>, 11). In his preface to <i>A Testimonie of Antiquities</i> (1566&#x2013;67), Parker drew on Saxon materials to authorize specific changes in Church practice, offering, as he put it, "testimonye of verye auncient tyme, wherein is plainly showed what was the judgement of the learned men in thys matter, in the days of the Saxons before the Conquest" (qtd. in <i>OES</i> 24&#x2013;5). This notion of a return to the Saxon ancestors' primitive honesty and simplicity laid the foundation for later, secular notions of race and specifically Anglo-Saxonism&#x2014;including Anglo-Saxonism's reincarnation, as Reginald Horsman has shown, among Thomas Jefferson and other "radical Whigs" in their visions of an independent United States.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>   </p>

<p>We can trace the turn from this strictly religious Anglo-Saxonism toward these more legal, cultural, and racial forms of Anglo-Saxonism by way of the Society of Antiquaries. Although originally founded by Tudor kings to support the Reformation, in the early decades of the seventeenth century, with the ascension to the throne of the absolutist Stuart kings James I and Charles I, the Society of Antiquaries turned its attention to old Saxon <i>legal</i> documents. As the Stuarts spoke with increasing insistence of their divine right to absolute rule, Parliament members began to make use of the legal documents being unearthed and translated by the Society's scholars to establish their right to debate laws and policies. Invoking the pre-Conquest Magna Carta and common law traditions, and presumably gathering evidence of Anglo-Saxon law-making councils, scholars such as Lambarde and Selden found themselves censored and imprisoned along with Sir Edward Coke and other Parliamentary lawyers who used these materials to challenge the Stuarts (<i>GE</i>, 126). Charles I finally disbanded the Society of Antiquaries by royal decree.  </p>

<p>Matters reached a crisis&#x2014;and the rhetoric of ancient Saxon rights found its legs&#x2014;when in 1620 the King issued a proclamation restricting Parliament's right to discuss 

<b></b>

high matters of state. Parliament responded directly, coining a language that would not only become the basis of its 1628 Petition of Right but would also create the heart of the Whig politics and Saxon myth that lasted well into the twentieth century:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The privileges and rights of Parliament are an ancient and indubitable birthright and inheritance of the English, and all important and urgent affairs in Church and State as well as the drawing up of laws and the remedying of abuses, are the proper subjects of the deliberation and resolutions of the Parliament. The members are free to speak upon them in such order as they please, and cannot be called to account for them. </p>

	<div class="attrib">
[<i>AL</i>, 38]
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In further exchanges with the King, the Parliament reasserted its "Ancient and Undoubted Right, and an Inheritance received from our Ancestors"&#x2014;sowing the seeds for a nativism that would later become racial and imperial&#x2014;until the King "publicly tore these protests from the Journal of the House of Commons and dissolved Parliament" (ibid.). Throughout the 1620s and 30s Parliament and the Stuart kings reached several such impasse moments. Finally, in 1629, Charles I dissolved Parliament&#x2014;and it did not reconvene until 1640.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, other forces were gathering. Across the Atlantic, a group of Englishmen was building a new commercial network that would eventually help to break the political impasse between King and Parliament&#x2014;and they were doing so through the rhetoric of a special English birthright to freedom. With the Parliamentary crisis of 1628&#x2013;9, culminating with Charles I's eleven-year dissolution of Parliament and renewed persecution of Puritans, a small group of Atlantic merchants who throughout the 1620s had been accruing land, power, and wealth in the west Atlantic joined hands with those interested in building colonies as safe havens for religious refugees. Together, to put it oversimply, these men overthrew the King. This is the period of Atlantic history that scholars of (at least) English-language modernity might attend to more closely, for here key terms are coined. In particular, the racialized rhetoric of liberty becomes a transatlantic phenomenon, and by the end of the seventeenth century it becomes embedded in the structures of English-language narrative, subtly organizing the colonial/modern psyche.  </p>

<p>Popular accounts of American colonization typically take a turn when they arrive at the disastrous bankruptcy of the early Virginia Colony; they leave behind that locale to tell the story of religious exile and the founding of the Puritan colony in Massachusetts. But not everyone left Virginia after the failure of the Virginia Company. On the contrary, the most important story of North American colonization may lie with the men who stayed on. Men such as Maurice Thomson and his brother-in-law William Tucker, who had begun as ship captains, entered the breach left by the retreat of the King's trading companies in Virginia.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The absence of Royal Company rules allowed these men to run both exports and imports and to set up shop on both sides of the Atlantic (a practice prohibited in the royal companies). As a result they quickly monopolized the import of supplies for settlers as well as the export of tobacco. They accrued huge profits. Working together with a handful of others, they eventually expanded their reach south to the West Indies (where they headed interloping invasions against the colonies 

<b></b>

of other European powers) and north to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, financially backing the Puritan settlement of Massachusetts and helping to organize provisions for colonies both north and south.  </p>

<p>In the 1620s through the 1640s, as Robert Brenner notes, there thus evolved "growing ties between the American merchant leadership and the great Puritan aristocrats who ran the Bermuda and Providence Island companies, as well as the lesser gentry who governed the New England colonies" (<i>MR</i>, 149). These ties laid the foundation for the "transatlantic network of Puritan religio-political opposition to the crown" that included Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and, in the West Indies, Bermuda Island and Providence Island, all of which drew investors for religious and political reasons as well as for profits and all of which served as both "ports of exile and staging posts for revolt" (<i>MR</i>, 113, 110). Under these conditions, the pursuit of religious freedom, so touted in U.S. history books, was deeply involved with the pursuit of mercantile freedom: for, even when religious motives were paramount, economic "freedoms" were requisite to make the colonial settlements viable, as Karen Kupperman has shown.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Furthermore, it was from this base, and for this base, that Maurice Thomson and his circle began to interlope in the slave trade and the East Indies trade, and then in turn to build the enormously profitable West Indies sugar plantations during the 1640s (<i>MR</i>, 161&#x2013;5).  </p>

<p>And of course, as C.L.R. James, Eric Williams, and others since have shown, these sugar plantations significantly funded England's entry into the emerging economic world-system that would manufacture, so to speak, modernity/coloniality.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  More immediately, these colonial developments shaped the events of the Civil War in England&#x2014;so that, for instance, the colonialists' tobacco and sugar profits fueled Parliamentary warships.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  In a sense, the English Civil War and its aftermath, from Cromwell's Commonwealth to Queen Victoria's empire, find their necessary cause in the 1610s through the 1630s, in the form of a transatlantic group of "new men"&#x2014;middling-class and eventually Puritan-affiliated&#x2014;who initiated the activities and alliances that would reshape the economic balance of power (consolidating a shift that had begun with land distribution, privatization, and enclosure in the sixteenth century).  </p>

<p>But this is not all. A nativist-tinged rhetoric of liberty crucially authorized this entry of England into the transnationality of the modern/colonial world&#x2014;and it did so regardless of whether this ideology was an essential cause or a serviceable epiphenomenon. Many of the transatlantic and merchant petitions to Parliament during the mid-1640s cultivated the language of freedom and rights, often accented&#x2014;although almost no scholars have analyzed it&#x2014;with nativist tones. Various groups took up this language, including both these new merchants (who turned it against royal-company monopolies) and the disenfranchised (who turned it against these very same merchants, in order to challenge the merchants' newly emerging monopolies). In "The Humble Petition of Divers Citizens"  presented to the London City Council, as the writers challenge the contradictions in the new Parliament's policies, they implicitly invoke a proto-Whig and nativist liberty rhetoric: 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Seeing the Parliament ordained, that none should be accepted to be a Parliament-man, that had been a Monopolizer to the Kings Councell, and false judges against the Liberties of the free-men of <i>England</i>, is it not as unjust to imploy [<i>sic</i>] any man in a place of Trust, Credit, or profit now in Parliament . . . , that have been known to be a Monopolizer in any place or Office to or for the Parliament, to the prejudice of the Free-men of <i>England</i>?<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Likewise, "A Remonstrance of Many Thousand Citizens, and other Free-Born People of England to theire [<i>sic</i>] own House of Commons" complains of "the oppression of the Turkey Company, and the Adventures Company, and all other infringements of our Native Liberties [which] yee seemed to abominate, are now by you complyed [<i>sic</i>] withall, and licensed to goe [<i>sic</i>] on" (<i>TLP</i>, III, 358). Via the momentum of these political, economic, gender, and religious struggles, a new libertarian narrative of a native, Saxonist identity began to take hold.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, with the temporary abolition of an official censorship office in the 1640s, this racialized liberty rhetoric spread "downward."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  In the absence of censorship, there circulated increasing numbers of polemical newspapers, pamphlets, and petitions that eventually made it impossible for the entrepreneurs and the Puritans to maintain control of the liberty discourse. Indeed, this is the moment when the Habermasian public sphere becomes a reality in England&#x2014;briefly yet influentially.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Especially as the Puritan-slanted Parliament gained the upper hand in the war, numerous petitions were presented to the House of Commons, expressing the desire of soldiers, soldiers' wives, tradespeople, religious sects, and laborers for relief from painful economic conditions and for fuller representation of their voices. This is also the period with which Janet Lyon begins her wonderful study of manifestoes in modernity, casting these documents as deliberate expressions of "the breach between modernity's promissory notes and their payment."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  But the racial rhetoric lacing these documents is equally formative of coloniality/modernity, including as it eventually shapes modernist writing.  </p>

<p>All of these groups, women as well as men, spoke of "native rights," "the people's just rights and liberties," their ancient "privileges," the "Nation's freedoms," "the free-born people of England," and the "free-born People's freedoms or rights."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Their emphasis is on a peculiarly English legacy of liberty. Politicized middle-rank women as well as men participated in this emergent discourse, writing petitions, holding meetings, and joining or leading public protests. Early in 1641, for instance, four hundred women gathered at Parliament to demand a response to a petition on the loss of trade. When they received no satisfactory answer, they penned the "Humble Petition of many hundreds of distressed women, Tradesmens wives, and widdowes" in which they claimed that "we have an interest in the common Privileges with them [who have petitioned for the] Liberty of our Husbands, persons, and estates."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The liberty rhetoric was also taken up by women preachers, who defended their public speaking by claiming a right "equall unto men, as also a proportionable share in the freedoms of the Commonwealth" ("UCS," 102). </p>

<p>Pamphleteer Nathaniel Bacon was among those who elaborately laid out the Saxonist historical narrative underlying this nativist rhetoric that would become Whig orthodoxy 

<b></b>

by the early eighteenth century. In his <i>Historical and Political Discourse of the Laws and Government of England</i>, which addressed the "Debate concerning the Right of an English King to Arbitrary Rule over English Subjects, as Successor to the Norman Conqueror" , Bacon remarked that it is  </p>

<p class="continued">Such pronouncements opened the way to more radical thinkers such as the Diggers, who nonetheless invoked the same protoracial, nativist rhetoric. The Digger Gerard Winstanley echoed it in pronouncing that "the last enslaving conquest which the enemy got over Israel was the Norman over England" (<i>PR</i>, 179). The many transnational migrations, colonial rebellions, historical ironies, and disavowed crimes&#x2014;not to mention the fork-tongued texts&#x2014;of English-language Atlantic history arose from and within this inextricable intertwining of the colonial, revolutionary, and nativist roots of the modern notion of freedom. The material circuit of transnational activities&#x2014;at once dissenting and protocapitalist&#x2014;encouraged the race discourse that came to define the coloniality/modernity matrix.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Racial Transnationalism's Interior Force
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The race-liberty legacy also began in the seventeenth century to be cast as both an interior and a historical force, an important development to notice if we are to see the racialized historical content that modernism grappled with in its later "inward turn" and its refashioning of social subjectivity. This early interior turn challenged the paradigm under which the monarchy and its subjects obeyed a divine law, and in which the ruling head of the king decreed laws for the body of the people. The new formation placed the source of laws and principles within each person (partly under the influence of the Protestant Reformation, which, as we saw, itself had a nativist inflection in England). Its more strictly political aspect was signalled by Leveller pamphleteer John Warr in his claim that "Justice was in men, before it came to be in Laws" and was conceptualized more suggestively in Winstanley's notion that "the great Creator, who is the Spirit Reason" and is man's "teacher and ruler within himself" generates "the spreading power of righteousness that gives liberty to the whole creation" (<i>GE</i>, 269; <i>PR</i>,174&#x2013;6). In these formulations, freedom's nativized historical legacy gets rooted within the psyche of the person&#x2014;which potentially opens the way to the universalization of freedom claims. But under the pressure of an emergent capitalism and Atlantic modernity/coloniality matrix, the contrary eventually occurs: interiority itself is made 

<b></b>

native and exclusive&#x2014;a new site of cultural chauvanism, a new rationale for the racial terrorism of slavery, whose victims were said to lack such an interior.  </p>

<p>In the course of the eighteenth century, history and literature performed the cultural work of fashioning this native, English interior and creating an English-language imaginary formed around it. First of all, historian after historian, from Rapin to Gibbon, eclipsed the Britons' influence in English history-proper and gave pride of place to the freedom-seeking Germanic (or Gothic) Anglo-Saxons, famed for implanting a "free," participatory form of government in England. In his epic narrative-poem "Liberty" , James Thomson tells a popular version of the tale that the historians worked to document&#x2014;of "Liberty's" travels from Greece to Rome and then, triumphantly, to the northern climes, from which region the "yellow-haired, the blue-eyed Saxon" of "the Gothic nations" dispersed to carry liberty to England and the world.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Even the more conservative David Hume, an open critic of Whig politics, contributed to this emergent orthodoxy in his immensely influential <i>History of England</i>. In his account, the Britons showed a too-weak devotion to liberty under the Romans, whereas the Anglo-Saxons' "manners and customs were wholly German" so that they displayed "a fierce and bold liberty [which] gave rise to those mutual jealousies between them and the Normans."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Importantly, he also suggests that the Anglo-Saxons initiated record-keeping to underwrite their government, and in this sense he positions himself as their freedom-upholding historian-descendant. Several decades later, writing his magisterial <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> (1776&#x2013;1778), Edward Gibbon could count on his British readers' assent to the fantasy that "the invincible Goths . . . issued in numerous swarms from the neighborhood of the Polar circle, to chastise the oppressors of mankind."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  And this of course is the story the Anglo-American revolutionaries proudly inherited&#x2014;fashioning themselves as the true Whigs who would do right by the Anglo-Saxon legacy. For, as Trevor Colbourn remarks in his seminal study of the influence of Saxonist history on the American Revolution, in the minds of the rebellious American colonists "English history had been the history of freedom," which now required Anglo-Americans to carry it forward.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>   </p>

<p>But it is the radical-Whig historian Catharine Macaulay who explicitly makes this Germanic legacy a dimension of an interior, English <i>sensibility</i>. In her account of "the exalted patriots" who "attacked the pretensions of the Stewart [<i>sic</i>] family, and set up the banner of Liberty," she explains that "noble principles had taken deep root in the minds of the English people," specifically those principles that "the people had preserved from the ruins of the Gothic constitution" which "had in it many latent resources to preserve Liberty."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  She advocates that this "inward principle of love to their country and of public Liberty" be actively cultivated in educating "English youth."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Macaulay thus develops an interiorized notion of psychically and organically "rooted" liberty impulses in the English. A couple of generations later, the historian Mercy Otis Warren helped to establish the transatlantic life of this formulation for U.S. Americans.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In a distinct echo of Macaulay, Warren's <i>History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution</i>  casts liberty as a "noble principle implanted in the nature of man" (<i>HRP</i>, I: 2&#x2013;3). She characterizes the American revolutionaries 

<b></b>

as paying homage to the "ancestors who . . . planted them in a happy soil," explaining that, although the colonists were "strongly attached to Great Britain, not only by the impression of ancient forms, but by religion, manners, language, and consanguinuity," in the new world they faced "a yoke unknown to their fathers" (<i>HRP,</i> I: 4, 99,109). Moved by their "hereditary love of freedom" and their "manly spirit of freedom," they had no choice but to revolt (<i>HRP</i>, I: 109).  </p>

<p>This psychohistorical fashioning of a racial will to freedom reaches its metaphysical climax and full flowering into racism in the later work of G. W. F. Hegel, especially in his <i>Philosophy of History</i>. At first, Hegel uncannily echoes the revolutionary Gerard Winstanley, in arguing that "Reason" drives the "Universal History" of the world toward "Freedom," but then the racial terms of his conception come into view as he argues that this energy has been most powerfully generated and instituted by German and especially Anglo-German culture: "The German spirit is the Spirit of the new World. Its aim is the realization of absolute Truth as the unlimited self-determination of Freedom. The destiny of the German peoples is to be the bearers of the Christian principle of Spiritual Freedom" and this principle has been "preserved in England more than in any other country."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Giving full expression to the racism that grew out of England's revolutionary nativism, Hegel infamously turns from proclaiming that "the History of the World is nothing but the development of the Idea of Freedom" to his insistence that Africans and Native Americans lack this Protestant "subjectivity" and world-historical freedom-consciousness and so stand outside of history: "Negroes see nothing unbecoming them [in slavery]" and Africa "is no historical part of the World," while American "aborigines" have no "independence of feeling," and show only a "crouching submissiveness."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  In this formulation, the Anglo-Saxon inheritance becomes both a sensibility and a world-historical force, rolling over and past any "peoples" who apparently lack its proud "independence of feeling." Thus did a racialized discourse of Englishness arise with the Reformation, become intertwined with the idea of liberty during the English Civil War, fashion a free interiority in the course of the eighteenth century, and ultimately provide a revolutionary ballad structure for an operatic, epic racism by the end of that century.  </p>

<p>This account of the discursive and political coupling of race and liberty in Atlantic history revises Benedict Anderson's account of the nation as well as current theories of transnationalism. It clarifies how the race-liberty matrix holds together an otherwise strained and double movement in nation-formation&#x2014;and in subject-formation. Race works as a binding force <i>in the face of</i> the nation's own transnational dispersions; and the racing of liberty makes a virtue of this tension: if races manifest their spirits exactly by way of their deracinating struggles for freedom and their restless, "wilderness-clearing" movement across the globe, then the nations "of" those races are always trans-nations&#x2014;nations-plus, nations bursting and overflowing in their pursuit of freedom. Modern nations are nations-on-the-move. The best nations are global, and yet, by way of the idea of race, they are all the more national for that. Colonization thus becomes the fulfillment of a missionary and national destiny.  </p>

<p>And likewise for subjects: like Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Conrad's Marlow, those who journey across oceans to the places farthest from home turn out to be the most 

<b></b>

native, the nation's storytellers and the very embodiment of Englishness. We might note that the novel in English, from its inception with Aphra Behn's <i>Oroonoko</i>, repeatedly follows this pattern. Indeed, Anglo-Atlantic authors have consistently encoded this transnational race-liberty plot (after Behn, effacing the African-Atlantic role within it), while African-American authors have rewritten it and reclaimed the plot as theirs. Even a moment's pause over the implicit dialogue between Defoe's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and Olaudah Equiano's <i>Interesting Narrative</i>&#x2014;both of whose protagonists launch into Atlantic coloniality/modernity on "Guiney" slaving ships, "fall" into captivity, and yet rise into (free) Protestant Englishness&#x2014;should hint as much.  </p>

<p>Most often, and particularly relevant to my final argument here about the "libidinal currents" and sexual crises of modernism, English-language novels have used a sexual plot, with a ruinous fall at its center, to narrate the subject's transatlantic undoing and remaking under the sign of racial freedom.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  To appreciate modernism's reworking of this sexual element of the paradigm, it is instructive briefly to juxtapose two earlier texts&#x2014;Nathaniel Hawthorne's <i>Scarlet Letter</i> and Pauline Hopkins's <i>Contending Forces</i>. Hawthorne makes the events of his novel exactly contemporary with the English Revolution. At the center of it is a woman's "fall," catalyzed by a crossing of the Atlantic. The heroine's experience&#x2014;and her secretly free interior&#x2014;becomes all the more Anglo-American by virtue of her fall: "Standing alone in the world,&#x2014;alone, as to any dependence on society . . . [s]he assumed a freedom of speculation then common enough on the other side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had they known of it, would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatized by the scarlet letter."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  And thus has Hester come to stand in the canon for a paradigmatic Anglo-American independence of spirit. Her ruinous, ocean-crossing undoing that ends with her remaking (whether tragic or comic) as a free, modern subject becomes one master-narrative of the novel in English&#x2014;in texts from Defoe's<i> Moll Flanders</i> to Matthew Lewis's <i>The Monk</i> to Susanna Rowson's <i>Charlotte Temple</i> (the first&#x2014;and wildly popular&#x2014;American-published novel) to Melville's <i>Billy Budd</i>, in which this (feminized) sailor is ruined not only by Atlantic martial law but also by the suppressed and vengeful yearnings of Claggart.  </p>

<p>In these novels as in Hawthorne's, the protagonist's story of transnational travel, ruin, and freedom allegorizes that of the Anglo-Atlantic nation&#x2014;and substitutes for its larger political exclusions and ruinous violence (although Melville passingly acknowledges this Atlantic order when he opens and shadows his novella with the re of an African sailor). In Hawthorne's case, he fashions Hester as a singular, lonely subject exactly by eclipsing the transatlantic history that places her on American soil. For of course the "forefathers" knew full well about the speculation on the other side of the Atlantic, as Hawthorne himself would have been aware and his choice of the 1640s as his time period hints. As we saw, the Massachusetts colony was fully involved with events and people in England and on the continent (we need only recall that these Puritan settlers had first lived in Holland before removing to America), and those transatlantic speculations underlay the very founding of such a colony. But Hawthorne allows Hester's sexual ruin and his narration of her interior to stand <i>in place of</i> the revolutionary and mercantile history as well as the treachery and war practiced on Native Americans that made the

colony viable. Indeed Hawthorne labors to make the colony's elders innocent of that history&#x2014;guilty only of "sins" against a free woman.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Pauline Hopkins makes explicit allusion to <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> in her fiction, and in <i>Contending Forces</i> she brings to light the violent Atlantic history muffled within it.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  She, too, makes a woman's ruin the vehicle of this Atlantic history, yet in her fiction the fall occurs as <i>a direct effect of</i> this history rather than a sublimating substitute for it. Hopkins begins her story in Bermuda, on a plantation of hundreds of slaves. As she enters the mind of its owner, Charles Montfort, who is planning to emigrate to the U.S. to avoid immediately freeing his slaves, the disjunctive turns of her prose mimic the equivocations and narrative displacements required for the romanticization of this story. Meanwhile she inverts the plot, allowing the vengeful return of a repressed Atlantic history: shortly after Montfort's family's arrival in the U.S., he is murdered by white neighbors who suspect his wife of having Negro blood, she is apparently raped, and <i>his</i> children are enslaved or dispersed across the Atlantic ocean. Two generations later, this family's story converges with that of a young woman named Sappho Clark, a mulatta who is brutally raped by one of her white relatives, after which she goes incognito, migrates north, and eventually marries one of the descendants of the Montfort family. The novel ends with Sappho and her husband on board a ship ready to cross the Atlantic to England in order to claim an inheritance from another of the runaway Montforts who died rich there. In effect, Hopkins's novel itself reclaims an Atlantic history and a literary inheritance that Anglo-Atlantic novelists have suppressed or stolen.  </p>

<p>In this vexed dialectical way, from the 17<sup>th</sup> to the 20th centuries, I argue, a diverse range of English-language narratives move along the racialized, transatlantic arc that launches modernity/coloniality. They variously construct, recast, and question it. From a specifically U.S. viewpoint, these Atlantic texts structurally narrate the fact that "American history is always international and diasporic history," as Robin Kelley argues.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  To a certain extent, they also display how the same can be said of British history and literature&#x2014;and of some key Anglophone texts, which is one reason why I refer here to "English-language literature," borrowing but revising William Spengemann's use of this term.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>   </p>

<p>I want once more to emphasize that the trope of an Atlantic crossing repeatedly correlates in this paradigm with what (in the larger project) I call a swoon moment, involving a bodily "undoing" or "ruin" that is often sexual or coded as feminine: a character faints or momentarily collapses, overcome with an experience of violation by a terrorizing or tyrannizing force, whether seducer, slaver, or swallowing sea storm. The swoon marks the subject's formation in modernity/coloniality, dramatizing the way the process of transformation faces the subject with an abyss, a lack of ground, so that as it loses its old social identity, it faints&#x2014;only to reawaken, uprooted and yet newly racialized, "born again" from its own ashes. A primal, symbolic scene operating by way of displacement and condensation like Freudian dreamwork, the swoon distills the "undoing" effects of Atlantic violence arising from slavery, deracination, and the Atlantic's unanchoring, sink-or-swim, new capitalist economy. In effect, the protagonist's swoon signals the "trans" in the national: it marks the perilous, transatlantic passage that decides the person's destiny within the nation and its racialized order of freedom.

<h1 class="sec-headA">
Atlantic Modernism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>This long story of Atlantic history and English-language literature sheds a different light on English-language modernism. It suggests that there is something we can call Atlantic modernism, which would include writers identified with a range of literary race-traditions. These writers craft metafictions of this Atlantic history, some more critically or consciously than others.  </p>

<p>For, in fact, a whole fleet of modernist protagonists undertake water-crossing, racialized, transnational, and often failed launchings toward freedom that turn on a sexual fall and swoon: think of Jean Rhys's Marya, James's Isabelle Archer, and Forster's Adele. In Stein's ocean-crossing stories of "Gentle Lena," "Melanctha," and <i>The Making of Americans</i>, we find tales of "wandering" women made ill and finally sunk by the insistent demands of transnationally-formed racial and heteronormative identities, including both Germanness and Negro-ness&#x2014;and reinforced in the violence of Stein's own racist discourse.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  In Claude McKay's <i>Banjo</i>, his Afro-Caribbean and African-American characters (re)cross the Atlantic to Marseilles where they mingle with a diasporic community of Indians, Asians, and Africans; yet in the end they disperse again, thus yielding McKay's "novel without a plot"&#x2014;or as I would see it, his novel without a race destiny and freedom telos. McKay's novel furthermore pivots on the transatlantic, kissing-reunion of Jake and Banjo, whose final departure from Marseilles together entails a provocative, perhaps Sedgwickian sexual crisis involving their desire for the same woman.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Many of these authors, including McKay, Stein, Larsen, and Hemingway, flatten or make inaccessible their characters' subjective interiors, as if to demystify or make opaque the racialization of "deep" subjectivity; while others such as Woolf, Barnes, and Joyce seem determined to excavate characters' subterranean racial and sexual imaginations. Yet all of these authors' queer, alienated, or deconstructive aesthetic projects show a wry cynicism about racialized subjectivities. Accordingly, in Atlantic modernist novels, the genre's often-sentimental or redemptive swoon becomes stylized, diminished, or parodied&#x2013;such as in Sasha Jansen's final ruin at the hands of her anonymous hotel neighbor&#x2014;her final "drowning," as she casts it. What gets drowned, rejected, or lost in these distilled swoons is not so much a prelapsarian or virgin self, as in many earlier English-language novels, but rather a certain straying, queerly sensuous self.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Like these other modernists, Larsen and Woolf collapse the novel's freedom trajectory exactly by putting pressure on the racial and sexual matrix of modernity/coloniality. As they begin to step aside from the freedom plot, they accordingly begin to unravel its racial and sexual bindings and to question the allure of transnational mobility and (as we would put it today) hybridity. When Larsen takes Countee Cullen's lines about a speaker "three centuries removed" from Africa as the epigraph to <i>Passing</i>, and Woolf embeds allusions to Sir Walter Raleigh in her sea-soaked novels, beginning with Rachel Vinrace's "voyage out" into South America, they gesture toward the historical and transatlantic horizon in which they write.

<b></b>

  </p>

 

<p>Woolf's novels repeatedly recast the Atlantic story of liberty and ruin. Postcolonial readings of Woolf most often consider her in relation to India, sensibly, since it is the most frequently referenced imperial locale in her work, and they give some attention to the South American setting in <i>The Voyage Out</i>. If, however, we consider these water tropes in her writing as expressions of the colonial legacy more broadly, we can better plumb the depth of her brooding on the sea-crossing past and transnational substructure of the British empire. While a number of critics have brought to the surface the plentiful gay or queer currents of Woolf's writing, only Robin Hackett has treated them at length in relation to empire, in her reading of <i>The Waves</i>.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  I want in addition to suggest that when we trace Woolf's water and drowning tropes within the context of a transatlantic imaginary in English-language fiction, we see how her entire oeuvre broods on this vortex of race, freedom, and sexuality.  </p>

<p>Read within the long history of the Atlantic, for instance, the plot of <i>The Voyage Out</i> suddenly appears much more pointed. It recasts the Atlantic crossing, including its pivotal turn on a ruinous kiss. From the outset, Woolf narrates this sea-crossing as a launch toward freedom. On the first morning of her characters' transatlantic journey, as they all rise together to the deck, Helen exclaims "Oh, look! We're out at sea!" and the narrator remarks on their state of feeling: " They were free of roads, free of mankind, and the same exhilaration at their freedom ran through them all."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Yet soon after Rachel finds herself alone on deck, and "down she looked into the depth of the sea," imagining the "black ribs of wrecked ships" (<i>VO</i>, 27). Insofar as the ship also gets red as an image of Rachel ("a bride going forth to her husband" in a state "more lonely than the caravan crossing the desert" and on a sea that "might give her death, or some unexampled joy"), the image of shipwreck preres Rachel's own fate in the freedom passage (<i>VO</i>, 19). </p>

<p>Rachel's symbolic ruin on this journey begins with Richard Dalloway's surreptitious kiss as his wife lies below deck recovering from seasickness after the storm in which they are all temporarily "unmoored" like "atoms flying in the void"&#x2014;in a self-unmaking, sea-storm trope that reaches directly back to <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>(<i>VO</i>, 72). On cue, just after he offers to send Rachel some copies of Burke's pamphlets on "the French revolution&#x2014;The American Rebellion," there follows the symbolic sexual fall associated, in the Atlantic imaginary, with these revolutions. The ship lurches, and Dalloway seizes the moment to "kiss her passionately, so that she felt the hardness of his body" after which she "fell back in her chair, with tremendous beats of the heart, each of which sent black waves across her eyes" (<i>VO</i>, 76). Her sleep that night is disturbed by nightmares.  </p>

<p>Overdetermined nightmares. Colonial nightmares. Swooning nightmares in which Rachel symbolically dies and then awakens into a "barbarian" surround. She dreams that she is trapped in a vault with "a little deformed man who squatted on the floor gibbering with long nails . . . and the face of an animal. The wall behind him oozed with damp . . . Still and cold as death she lay, not daring to move, until she broke the agony by tossing herself across the bed, and woke crying 'Oh!'" (<i>VO</i>, 77). Awaking from this terrorized, death-like state, "she felt herself pursued, so that she got up and actually 

<b></b>

locked her door. A voice moaned for her; eyes desired her. All night long barbarian men harassed the ship; they came scuffling down passages, and stopped to snuffle at her door" (<i>VO</i>, 77). Now implicitly marked as a non-barbarian, Rachel has arrived in Atlantic modernity/coloniality. Although she lands, so to speak, on the safer side of slash, this position also turns out to be deadly for a young, marriagable woman whose community looks to her, insistently, nostalgically, invasively, for its reproduction. As critics including myself have discussed, homoerotic ties also get sacrificed in this crossing-over experience, between Helen and Rachel as well as Hewett and Hirst.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In conflating, via Rachel's nightmares, the crass actions of Richard Dalloway with the threat of "barbarian men" who finally reappear during the delirium that forecasts her death (red as her drowning fall), Woolf reenacts the long Atlantic history of substitutions in which the coercions of colonizing Anglo-Atlantic peoples get reframed, in white people's imaginations, as the threat of the colonized. Without entering here into the question of how much critical distance Woolf exercises in these representations, which I do elsewhere, we can observe that she follows the logic in which "barbarian men" become the fall guys for Anglo-Atlantic subjects, for the English-proud Richard Dalloways.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  For my purposes in this essay, it is enough to note that in this, her first novel, Woolf intuitively labors to rewrite and expose the runinous effects of an old Atlantic plot.  </p>

<p>One could walk through each of Woolf's novels charting her navigation of this Atlantic literary and political history. To take another fairly obvious example before turning at more length to a less obvious one, in <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, Woolf narrates the death of a mother in the wake of a sea storm and the subsequent journey of a brother-sister pair who feel forced into a "compact" to "t tyranny to the death."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  She just hints that the imperial woman's stormy death entails a loss of homoerotic yearnings (on Lily's part and, as Ruth Vanita has persuasively shown, on Bankes's and Carmichael's parts as well), although it may also leave more room for a gay comraderie and an art working outside of a racial telos.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Woolf organizes the family drama of this novel around the sea. In "The Window," Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay's relationship unfolds through their opposed orientations toward an Atlantic horizon and its future. They argue especially over the question of whether a sea adventure will be possible for the youngest son, James, who Mrs. Ramsay already imagines at the center of the British empire, "all red and ermine on the Bench" (<i>TL</i>, 4). In the end, Mr. Ramsay's pessimism is correct, and in "Time Passes," Mrs. Ramsay dies amidst "a downpouring of immense darkness," while the "sea tosses itself and breaks itself" during days and nights "full of wind and destruction" (<i>TL</i>, 125, 128). In the final section of the novel, after the loss of their mother, brother, and sister in this interruptive, sea-tossed section of the novel that encapsulates historical time's passing, Cam and James Ramsay launch out on their long-awaited, historically overdetermined journey.  </p>

<p>In her narration of this journey, Woolf indicates that Cam and James symbolically enter Atlantic history when they embark. She evokes, first of all, their shared sense of freedom at setting out, like that of the characters in <i>The Voyage Out</i>: "James, with his 

<b></b>

eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon, steered grimly. But he began to think as he steered that he might escape; he might be quit of it all. They might land somewhere; and be free then. Both of them [Cam and James], looking at each other for a moment, had a sense of escape and exaltation, what with the speed and the change" (<i>TL</i>, 165). Meanwhile, the brother and sister pledge themselves "united in their compact to t tyranny to the death" in the form of their father (<i>TL</i>, 164). Yet like all such journeys, this excursion is full of perils and losses, as Woolf insinuates when she interweaves her narration of it with Macalister's tale of a recent sea storm and shipwreck and at the same time punctures it with Mr. Ramsay's sudden cries that (in Atlantic modernity/coloniality) "We perished each alone" (<i>TL</i>, 164&#x2013;5). And Cam, after all, waivers in her commitment to this journey and its telos. She finds herself more interested in the water's rush on her palm and in those ruined things lost at the bottom of the sea, like Rachel Vinrace. She feels caught in a story that is more her father's and brother's than hers.  </p>

<p>And up on the cliff, Lily paints and watches this scene with Chinese eyes. And Woolf paints Lily painting and watching. And we can watch them both engaged in acts of encoded representation, queers in allegiance, as Ruth Vanita suggests, yet also artists accruing capital exactly from that "chinese" otherness. At this point in the long history, as Woolf seems to have understood, race need hardly be mentioned as a key to the story. The Ramsay men have large foreheads and blue eyes, the young woman artist has Chinese eyes, the old woman cleaning and preserving the house has the name McNab, all while Mr. Ramsay continues reading the quintessential British novelist Walter Scott. The children t tyranny as they set out on the sea, thinking that when they land they will "be free then." The code is encrypted, an encrypting that Woolf's artistry imitates. At the same time, keeping in mind Urmilla Seshagiri's reading of Lily as, in effect, a colonialist artist, borrowing forms (like Woolf) from African and Oriental traditions as instruments of dissent within her own culture, we can note that Woolf's own practice evinces her immersion in this legacy.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For even clearer, more pointed indications of Woolf's self-consciousness about this legacy in which her art is entangled, it is helpful to turn back to the less subtle <i>Jacob's Room</i>. The novel begins with Jacob as a boy at seaside, rocked by his discovery of a hidden, kissing couple; it juxtaposes his sea crossings and his foreign travel against the background of English sea storms back home; it sets the story's most queerly sexual moment on a boat; and it foreshadows his death in war as a drowning of soldier-sailors. Furthermore, in this early novel Woolf depends on a more obtrusive narrator to establish that she means to probe a little more deeply into the "chasms" in Atlantic modernity/coloniality, with its wars, empires, exiles at sea, and capsized desires. She reminds her readers of the transnational travels subtextually fostering and structuring the life of the nation. Take the following passage, in which her narrator steps aside to comment: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The strange thing about life is that though the nature of it must have been apparent to everyone for hundreds of years, no one has left any adequate account of it. The streets of London have their map; but our passions are uncharted. What are you going to meet if you turn this corner?

<p>As frequent as street corners in Holborn are these chasms in the continuity of our ways. Yet we keep straight on. </p>

<p class="continued">Placed here, as the sunken story, is the history of sea and empire that touches and shapes all those you might meet around a corner in Holborn&#x2014;the story of ships and fevers and crimes committed, fill in the sketch as you like. These stories harbor the chasms in "the continuity of our ways," the swoons in our sea crossings.  </p>

<p>Woolf's narrator, filling in the sketch, creates an aesthetic analogue for such chasms when she leaps abruptly in the next paragraph (as if across the slash between coloniality and modernity) to the paradigmatic story of a modern "Helen and Jimmy," and the crisis of Jimmy's refusal to marry Helen. The narrator reports that the community's gossipers, "kind Mr. Bowley and dear Rose Shaw" deplore Jimmy's refusal, which looms as a threatening chasm in their ways. In a seeming non sequitur (and another textual chasm) the narrator then suddenly turns to the reader and remarks that "if you persist that a command of the English language is a part of our inheritance, one can only reply that beauty is almost always dumb. Male beauty in association with female beauty breeds in the onlooker a sense of fear. Often have I seen them&#x2014;Helen and Jimmy&#x2014;and likened them to ships adrift, and feared for my own little craft" (<i>JR</i>, 83). These comments imply that, far from embodying "our inheritance" of an articulate, English-language civilization, Helen and Jimmy, and their policing admirers, are adventuring ships on the loose, doing damage. Woolf's prose follows their lurching, crashing movements.  </p>

<p>These odd juxtapositions and shifts are typical of <i>Jacob's Room</i>. The narrative not only stays behind, so to speak, at the end of a scene to capture what's lost in the break or cut&#x2014;the emptiness of a room from which humans have departed, or the ravaging winds of a sea storm to which sleepers are indifferent&#x2014;but it also habitually swerves from the trivial matchmaking of the Bowleys and Shaws to the transnational theater of world war. Woolf's juxtapositions consistently imply that normative sexuality is at stake in this war and its attendant colonial crimes, and that apparently harmless gossip about who should marry whom carries behind it an immense and deadly "force." Thus in another scene, just after the gossipers dissect what they consider Clara Durrant's "alarming" depths of feeling (which might swamp her proper choice of partner) and then coyly refer to Dick Bonamy as a "dark horse" with a "peculiar disposition" (since he is a man who by his own account "couldn't love a woman"), the narrator again disconcertingly, without explanation, lifts her eye to the horizon and away from this heteronormative world of gossip (<i>JR</i>, 135,122). Our gaze is directed to a fleet of battleships on the North Sea:

<p class="continued">Woolf here sums up the whole transnational, force-driven order of things&#x2014;its disciplining of bodies; its global network of banks, laboratories, chancellories, houses of business, and police; its eschewing of sudden (sexual) impulses; and its deadly wars that drown young men, like Jacob, in the prime of life.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile the novel tracks Jacob's wandering travels through Italy and Greece, haunted by his wandering, queer desires simultaneously for his intimate friend Bonamy and for Clara Durrant, and it reveals his sudden plunges into depression. While in Greece for instance (notably), provoked by his reading of the transnational newspaper, the <i>Daily Mail</i>, Jacob suddenly feels engulfed by "this gloom&#x2014;this surrender to the dark waters which lap us about," falling into a depressed mood which, the narrator remarks, is "a modern invention" (<i>JR</i>,121). Although he momentarily fantasizes going into Parliament and making speeches about the world's problems, he asks "but what use are fine speeches, once you surrender an inch to the black waters?" Ultimately, Woolf implies at the end of her novel, he joins the war and is indeed surrendered to the black waters. He will fall from the boat along with other young men and "go under," not merrily like Shakespeare or the Greeks, but under the weight of an unseizable force and an Atlantic history of overpowering sorrow.  </p>

<p>In <i>Quicksand</i>, Larsen immediately signals the Atlantic double-cross underlying her fiction. The very name of her protagonist, Helga Crane, alludes to the Germanic and marine dimensions of the legacy. As I have argued elsewhere, Helga Crane becomes an Atlantic wanderer as she searches for what she calls "freedom, that blessed sense of belonging to herself alone and not to a race."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Here I want to emphasize how, in addition, at a key Atlantic turning point in Helga's story, Larsen hints that Helga is a queer subject whose transnational travel is provoked by (and fails to heal) her sexual as well as her racial alienation.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  From this angle, we can see that <i>Quicksand</i> provides a transatlantic backstory for <i>Passing</i>'s tale of queer desire.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>   </p>

<p>All of Helga's problems begin with an Atlantic crossing that is also a racial and sexual crossing. That is, they begin with her mother, a white Scandinavian woman 

<b></b>

who emigrates to the U.S., falls in love with an African-American man, gets pregnant, is abandoned, and thus is ruined in her movement toward freedom&#x2014;like many an immigrant or colonist before her. This mother eventually marries a white man whose family rejects Helga, which leaves Helga with "no people," as she puts it. In enfolding this story of Helga's mother into her novel, Larsen positions an old transatlantic, sexual plot of racialized self-loss at the heart of Helga's conflicts. We first learn of this history that Helga calls the "wound" of her past, when Dr. Anderson, the director of the Naxos school where she teaches, attempts to persuade her to stay at the school, which prizes, he says, "a lady" like her with "tendencies inherited from good stock" (<i>QP</i>, 21). "[J]olted into a rage," as the text puts it, Helga scornfully tells him her story and flees the school&#x2014;she flees its racial codes in search of an un-raced freedom&#x2014;only to repeat, ultimately, her mother's history of freedom-seeking, transatlantic crossings ending in racial "ruin" (<i>QP</i>, 22). </p>

<p>While Woolf creates characters caught <i>within</i> the racial telos of freedom, Larsen thus represents the struggle of those left <i>outside</i> of this narrative. In Larsen's rendering, Helga can find no freedom exactly because she lacks an embracing race community within which to pursue it. With no "people," Helga has no ready point of entr&#x00E9;e into the freedom story. She cannot do "uplift" into freedom if she is not fully identified with or accepted by any race. Helga's dilemma sharply discloses the history within which freedom has been made captive to race, and her story signals the flaw in any assumption that transnational travel will in itself offer liberation from anything, including race. Instead, Helga displays for us how transnational travel has structured the terms of race identity.  </p>

<p>Helga's predicament finds its earliest and most compact expression in her reflections on colorful dress. She indicts the school's "suppression of individuality and beauty," taking its disapproval of color and boldness in clothing as one instance of this suppression.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Yet she understands her own love of color as the "inherent <i>racial</i> need for gorgeousness, . . . [for] bright colors" (<i>QP</i>, 20, 18, emphasis added). Is dress an expression of the individual or the race? Is it unfettered individuality or racial identity that Helga seeks? Freedom from race, or freedom for the race?  </p>

<p>After Helga's arrival in New York, the plot of the novel might be characterized as her vacillating movement toward and away from race as a ground of identity, a series of racial reaction-formations in a quest for freedom.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  In New York, as at first in Chicago, Helga feels "that magic sense of having come home" for "Harlem, teeming black Harlem, had welcomed her and lulled her into something that was, she was certain, peace and contentment" (<i>QP</i>, 43). In her initial identification with African American community, she "lost that tantalizing oppression of loneliness and isolation" looking on the "white world" as a collection of "sinister folk . . .who had stolen her birthright" (<i>QP</i>, 45). The old language of birthright resurfaces here, just as later Larsen's narrator describes Helga as feeling "yoked" to race. In New York, she relishes a contentment that "she knew sprang from a sense of freedom, a release from the feeling of smallness which had hedged her in, first during her unchildlike childhood among hostile white folk . . . and later . . . among snobbish black folk in Naxos" (<i>QP</i>, 46). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Yet, as the next page and chapter announce, "it didn't last, this happiness" for "somewhere, within her, in a deep recess, crouched discontent" (<i>QP</i>, 47). In this new city of freedom, she again comes to feel "shut in, trapped" as she discovers that race encloses its landscape as well; so, increasingly "she made lonely excursions to places outside of Harlem" while "a sensation of estrangement and isolation encompassed her" (<i>QP</i>, 47&#x2013;8). She finds especially that she "wanted to be free of this constant prattling of the incongruities, the injustices, the stupidities, the viciousness of white people" (<i>QP</i>, 49). It is not only that she is bothered by the "inconsistencies" in her friends who hate but imitate the white world, but also that this hatred "stirred memories, probed hidden wounds, whose poignant ache bred in her surprising oppression and corroded the fabric of her quietism" (ibid.). The hidden wound is her unnameable kinship with whites and her subsequent experience of emotional isolation from all family and community.  </p>

<p>Thinking she can escape this oppression by leaving the U.S., when the letter from her uncle arrives containing money and suggesting she visit her white aunt in Copenhagen, her sensation is "one of relief, of liberation" (<i>QP</i>, 54). She realizes abruptly that she had been feeling "boxed up, with hundreds of her race, closed up with that something in the racial character which had always been, to her, inexplicable, alien" and now she wants no longer to be "yoked to these despised black folk" (<i>QP</i>, 55). At the very center of Larsen's novel, on board a ship sailing across the Atlantic to Europe, Helga feels a "returned sense of happiness and freedom, that blessed sense of belonging to herself alone and not to a race" (<i>QP</i>, 64).  </p>

<p>Helga's trip might promise to undo the legacy of the middle passage, but instead of freedom from race, in Copenhagen Helga finds that she is paraded by her aunt and uncle "like a veritable savage" (<i>QP</i>, 92). Their acceptance of her also depends, ultimately, on their deployment of her racialized, marriagable body to strengthen their ties to the wealthy social order. Far from providing an escape from race, Helga's transnational travel reveals how race gains its force and its charge exactly within this border-crossing circuit. Her exotic origins, her clothing, and her body all serve, in Africanist fashion, to display her relatives' risqu&#x00E9; social habits, but of course their liberty is her captivity. Helga's access to any such risqu&#x00E9; freedom is blocked equally by her apparent race identity and by her lack of race identity. </p>

<p>Moreover, in a move that both compares to and contrasts with Woolf's, Larsen hints at the queer feelings that threaten to arise within the racial lacunae that Helga occupies. She creates a quiet foreshadowing of the story she tells in <i>Passing</i>. In two scenes that frame Helga's Atlantic crossings&#x2014;the night club scene just before she departs from Harlem for Copenhagen and the party just after she returns to Harlem&#x2014;Larsen dramatizes the unanchoring of raced heteronormativity that attends, even unwillingly, Helga's rootless wandering across transnational borders.  </p>

<p>The chapter that precedes and, arguably, most urgently propels Helga's flight to Copenhagen, certainly ends on a very queer note. The moment is embedded, furthermore, in the most racially troubled scene in the novel, set in the Harlem cabaret that Helga "half unwillingly" goes to with Anne and her friends (<i>QP</i>, 58). In the midst of this scene, Helga takes a break from dancing and sits alone because she is troubled by 

<b></b>

feeling like "a jungle creature" when she dances. Looking around, she see Dr. Anderson across the room, sitting with a girl in a "shivering apricot frock" (<i>QP</i>, 60). Helga meets Anderson's gaze then turns her eyes away. </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p><i>	But</i> [the narrator tells us] they went back immediately to the girl beside him, who sat indifferently sipping a colourless liquid, or puffing a precariously hanging cigarette. Across dozens of tables, littered with corks, with ashes, with shriveled sandwiches, through slits in the swaying mob, Helga Crane studied her.</p>

<p class="continued">Across a series of obstacles suggestive of sexuality and its "withered" aftermath, Helga peers through a slit to fix her attention on Audrey Denney. Through Helga's eyes, the text caressingly details Denney's appearance, lingering over her "softly curving" yet "sorrowful" mouth, her pitch-black eyes "a little aslant . . . veiled by long, drooping lashes," her "dark hair brushed severely back," and finally the "extreme d&#x00E9;collet&#x00E9; of her simple apricot dress show[ing] a skin of unusual color, a delicate, creamy hue, with golden tones": "'Almost like an alabaster,' thought Helga" (ibid).  </p>

<p>Like Helga, Denney herself displays the light-skinned body that signifies transnational desire and ruin. Audrey's appearance openly queers racial and sexual norms, with her creamy skin and her severely brushed-back hair above an alluring d&#x00E9;collet&#x00E9;, a style extended into her choice of company, here the grey-eyed Anderson and, elsewhere, white people. Helga's dreamy enrapture by this body is sharply interrupted when, in the next sentence, the music stops and Helga's friend Anne arrives at the table with "rage in her eyes" and spews a diatribe about Denney as a "disgusting creature" who "ought to be ostracized" because she "goes about with white people" and throws racially mixed parties in which "white men dance with the coloured women" (ibid.). Helga herself, of course, always and involuntarily "goes about with white people" in her very genealogy, inwardly suffering the ostracization Anne fantasizes for Audrey Denney. No surprise, then, that Audrey Denney is so charged an object for Helga Crane. </p>

<p>Yet, in Larsen's rendering, Helga feels desire and attraction, not just identification. The chapter closes with a long paragraph devoted to Helga's observation of Audrey as she dances with Anderson "with grace and abandon, gravely, yet with obvious pleasure, her legs, her hips, her back, all swaying gently, swung by that wild music from the heart of the jungle" (<i>QP</i>, 62). As she continues watching, Helga suffers a kind of breakdown, perhaps what Patricia Juliana Smith would call a moment of sexual panic. Neither her exact emotion nor the exact object of it is specified in the description that follows, but the pressing, syncopated syntax builds a moment of racial and sexual crisis:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>She forgot the garish crowded room. She forgot her friends. She saw only two res, closely clinging. She felt her heart throbbing. She felt the room receding. She went out the door. She climbed endless stairs. At last, panting, confused, but thankful to have escaped, she found herself again out in the dark night alone, a small crumpled thing in a fragile, flying black and gold dress. A taxi drifted toward her, stopped. She stepped into it, feeling cold, unhappy, misunderstood, and forlorn. </p>

<p class="continued">By juxtaposition, Larsen implies that this scene catalyzes Helga's first transnational flight. Directly hereafter, the chapter ends and at the beginning of the next, we find Helga on an ocean liner headed across the Atlantic, "glad to be alone at last, free of that superfluity of human beings, yellow, brown, and black" (<i>QP</i>, 63). In leaving the U.S. and crossing the Atlantic to escape these bodies, however, Helga is perhaps also escaping her heart's desire, which takes the "lovely" form of the racially and sexually "superfluous" Audrey Denney. </p>

<p>And indeed Helga is drawn back exactly to this superfluity of queer beings who exceed the proper boundaries. Feeling trapped by race again in Copenhagen, she recrosses the Atlantic and returns to Harlem. She immediately attends a polyracial party where she again meets Robert Anderson, who still carries the shadow-presence of Audrey Denney. For Denney is at the party, too, and, in Helga's eyes, she again momentarily stands at the center of it. As Helga looks around, she sees African Americans, West Indians, a few white people, and "There too, poised, serene, certain, surrounded by masculine black and white, was Audrey Denney" (<i>QP</i>, 99). On this occasion, Helga directly asks to be introduced to this woman so oddly "surrounded by masculine black and white." </p>

<p>But this is the event that never occurs, neither in the chapter nor in the book&#x2014;not until, in displaced form, it perhaps surfaces in Larsen's next novella, <i>Passing</i>, in Irene's "Encounter" with Clare Kendry. In <i>Quicksand</i>, at this party Helga's movement toward Denney is interrupted by two men (by the "masculine" that "surrounds" Denney): first, she is intercepted by her old fianc&#x00E9; from Naxos, James Vayle (who waylays her on her way to Denney and who, like Anne, condemns the racial mixing at the party) and then, finally, by Anderson. Exactly at the moment when some of us might be wondering if Helga will meet Audrey Denney, Helga collides physically with Anderson, creating a swoon moment which keeps her from meeting Denney and ultimately leads to her final undoing near the end of the book. It is at the Harlem party that this downfall begins, when Helga steps through a doorway, and  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>somehow, she never quite knew exactly just how, into the arms of Robert Anderson.</p>
<p>She drew back and looked up smiling to offer an apology.</p>
<p>And then it happened. He stooped and kissed her, a long kiss, holding her close. She fought against him with all her might. Then, strangely, all power seemed to ebb away, and a long-hidden, half-understood desire welled up in her with the suddenness of a dream. </p>

<p class="continued">Just when Helga begins to face the fact that her "freeing" transatlantic travel is always in some way a return to race; just as she comes to "[t]his knowledge, this certainty of the division in her life into two parts in two lands"; just after she has expressed to James Vayle her lack of interest in marriage and children; and just at the moment when she might approach a "lovely" woman she admires&#x2014;Robert Anderson kisses her (<i>QP</i>, 96). </p>

<p>In Atlantic modernism, such kisses mark the turning point&#x2014;the early twentieth-century, often deflated version of the swoon&#x2014;in the protagonist's transnational voyage 

<b></b>

out, ostensibly into freedom. As Richard Dalloway kisses Rachel Vinrace in <i>The Voyage Out</i>, as Rochester kisses Bertha in <i>Wide Sargosso Sea</i>, as Adele <i>says</i> Aziz kisses her in <i>Passage to India</i>, Anderson's kiss reignites an old tainted history, the Gothic racial and sexual core of the English-language liberty plot. At this crisis, one can fairly hear the ghosts rattling their chains, or see what Rachel Vinrace dreams as the mocking goblins munching in their wet, dark corners, and what Helga calls the "skeletons that stalked lively and in full health through the consciousness of every person of Negro ancestry in America" (<i>QP</i>, 96). These kisses mark the heroine's discovery of her own desire, and they seem to open to her a world of unencumbered transnational freedom; but as it turns out they also constitute the very event that steals her desire and turns it into an experience of violation or ruin&#x2014;and returns her to the racially imbricated order of things. Thus does the novel end with Helga marrying a southern preacher and giving birth to an endless round of children. With this abrupt, unliberating ending, Larsen refuses, like Woolf, to endorse the dream of transatlantic freedom, choosing instead to expose the woman's, and the queer's, drowning within Atlantic, transnational history.  </p>

<p>Like other Atlantic modernists, Larsen and Woolf register in their narrative structures the troubled history of transnational migrations and freedom projects on the Atlantic that have been deadly insofar as they have been racialized and made heteronormative within a modern/colonial order. Their texts can serve to remind us that the transnational aspects of modernism arise not strictly <i>against</i> the current of national or imperial histories, literary or otherwise. Rather, it is exactly by way of the transnational that these authors take up Atlantic history. They narrate their protagonists' ocean-crossing flights as panicked or depressed attempts to escape history, but these travels only return them to the sorrow of history that backs their panes of glass. Jacob Flanders and Helga Crane might hope to exercise the rooted, privileged freedoms conferred on national community members who can <i>thereby </i>travel both out and back over national borders, at will, for pleasure or profit. This, after all, is their proper Atlantic birthright: a transnationalism authorized by the nation. But transnational movement no more than national membership gains them their desires or their freedom. Thus Woolf and Larsen question the freedom promised not only by nations and empires but also specifically by the transnational mobility that constitutes them. As long as transnationalism's promise of freedom operates within the race-reproductive and modern/colonial order, it remains a ruse.  </p>

<p>Perhaps, then, we can think most transformatively, genuinely, and yet also realistically not by positioning liberatory <i>trans</i>national theories against constricting<i> national</i> institutions or ideologies, but rather by always remembering the relation between these two&#x2014;the "trans" and the "national." We might wonder whether the deconstruction of the modernity/coloniality formation might be fostered by the notion of a more interactive, dialectical relation between the national and the transnational. Given that the nation is still the only available apparatus within which most persons and collectivities vote and defend rights, even if within it they are also always at risk of losing rights, perhaps the goal of transnational thinking should not be strictly to deconstruct, supercede, or get free of the nation but rather to queer its history, avow its suppressed stories, and 

<b></b>

accept it as one of multiple venues of collective struggle. Creating narrative breaks where we expect freedom and closure, placing falls where we expect rises, tracing queer desire when we expect indifference, and, finally, making transnationalism part of the raced nation's story, many Atlantic modernists forecast the need for this flexible and complex vision. Their dredging up of an overpowering Atlantic sorrow and their very acknowledgment of a disavowed transnational past could be one step toward the imagining of a deracialized, collective, national and transnational future.  </p>

Like the other geomodernisms discussed in that collection, Atlantic modernism as I am discussing it here is self-consciously "placed," that is, situated (critically, anxiously, or otherwise) in the modern/colonial network, exactly so as to reconre the subjectivities within its geopolitical systems, especially as they are marked by race.

In their collection, <i>Minor Transnationalisms</i>, Francoise Lionnet and Shu-mei Shih usefully map, in both their introduction (1&#x2013;23) and in the essays they gather, the workings of such lateral transnationalisms (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2005). While not all of the essays tell stories that are strictly liberatory&#x2014;for instance, Shih's and Koshy's do not&#x2014;most do. I suggest that more deeply historical accounts of transnational circuits as they've developed over several centuries, as well as of their accompanying versions of what Koshy calls "transnational literacy," would bring into clearer view the tensions, contradictions, and double-edged effects of contemporary transnational practices . Ioanna Laliotou's <i>Transatlantic Subjects: Acts of Migration and Cultures of Transnationalism between Greece and America </i>(Chicago, Ill.: University of Chicago, 2004) wonderfully models an account of transnationalism that, for instance, places it in inextricable relation to the history of nationalism and migration; in her analysis, transnational migrations and identities provide what she calls a "dangerous supplement to" discourses of modernity and nationalism. Our work is complementary, although I am emphasizing how nationalism is always already embedded in transnationalism.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT43" href="#REF43">43</a>. Instead of choosing to see this reenactment in Woolf as <i>either</i> a troubled repetition of this history <i>or</i> as a conscious critique of it, I suggest that it is both. When Woolf invokes images of "barbarian men," which appear throughout her fiction, she is both expressing and critiquing a fear. In particular, the fact that these res take on characteristics that recall her own memories of sexual violation at the hands of a stepbrother indicates the ways that this fear carries the interconnected histories of gender and transnational freedom plots. In "A Sketch of the Past," Woolf's memory of Gerald Duckworth's molestations are closely associated with "a horrible face&#x2014;the face of an animal," the latter phrase echoing verbatim her description of the squatting man of whom Rachel dreams (<i>VO</i>, 69). Woolf allows her own trauma to find expression within Rachel's colonialist imagery. See Louise Desalvo, for full consideration of the effects of sexual abuse on Woolf's life and fiction. For more literary discussion of this dimension of Woolf's imagination and in particular as it pervades this novel (though not in relation to colonialist imagery), see <i>Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on her Life and Work</i> (Boston: Beacon, 1989); Jen Shelton, "Don't Say Such Foolish Things, Dear': Speaking Incest in The Voyage Out," <i>Incest and the Literary Imagination</i>, ed.

<div class="fn">
<p>At the same time, as I argue in the book, without wholly escaping her own fears and investments, Woolf in several ways calls attention to the fact that these images are <i>re</i>presentations. My understanding of this double impulse in Woolf is most in accord with that of Robin Hackett in her reading of the links between imperialism and lesbianism in <i>The Waves</i>. Hackett sees imperialist imagery as "one aspect of the structure of Woolf's own imagination" (<i>Sapphic Primitivism</i>, 61). </p>

<p id="lead">Einstein's theory of relativity forged a major paradigm shift in theorizing the relationship between time and space, one that systematized what some in the arts and philosophy of modernism were already beginning to articulate early in the century. More recently, cultural studies theorist Lawrence Grossberg has advocated what he calls "the timing of space and the spacing of time" as a precondition for a new "geography of beginnings."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Regarding space and time not as absolutes but rather as cognitive 

<b></b>

categories of human thinking, I want to build on these theories of relativity to examine the spatial politics of historical periodization&#x2014;the way that generalizations about historical periods typically contain covert assumptions about space that privilege one location over others. Fredric Jameson's imperative&#x2014;"Always historicize!"&#x2014;leads unthinkingly into binaries of center/periphery unless it is supplemented with the countervailing imperative&#x2014;Always spatialize!<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Jameson's widely influential essay, "Modernism and Imperialism," introduces the spatiality of global imperialism into his discussion of literary history and argues for imperialism as constitutive of modernist aesthetics in the West. But for him, modernism was over and done with by the end of World War II, to be followed by postmodernism characterized by a shift into the multinational corporate flows of late capitalism and new forms of imperialism.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Many others, including Walter Mignolo as evident in the epigraph, would agree with Jameson's insistence that Western modernity is inextricably tied to Western colonialism in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. However, I consider Jameson's spatialization of modernism incomplete.  </p>

<p>A full spatialization of modernism changes the map, the canon, and the periodization of modernism dramatically. Moreover, rethinking the periodization of modernism requires abandoning what I have called the "nominal" definition of modernity, a noun-based designation that names modernity as a specific moment in history with a particular societal conration that just happens to be the conditions that characterize Europe from about 1500 to the early twentieth century. The "relational" mode of definition, an adjectivally-based approach that regards modernity as a major rupture from what came before, opens up the possibility for polycentric modernities and modernisms at different points of time and in different locations.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Examining the spatial politics of the conventional periodization of modernism fosters a move from singularities to pluralities of space and time, from exclusivist formulations of modernity and modernism to ones based in global linkages, and from nominal modes of definition to relational ones.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
The Spatial Politics of Periodizing Modernism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Modernism is conventionally understood as a loose affiliation of aesthetic movements that unfolded in the first half of the twentieth century. This view is accurately reflected in the founding statement of the Modernist Studies Association, still listed on the website, although its parameters are considerably more limited than the wide-ranging work presented at the Modernist Studies Association annual conferences: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The Modernist Studies Association is devoted to the study of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts from <i>the later nineteenth- through the mid-twentieth century.</i> The organization aims to develop an international and interdisciplinary forum to promote exchange among scholars in this revitalized and rapidly changing field.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p>There is a spatial politics embedded in the Modernist Studies Association's temporal borders for modernism, roughly the 1890s&#x2013;1940s, one that picks up on the prevailing assumptions about temporality in the field more generally. Even within the European 

<b></b>

context, this dating privileges Anglo-American modernism, that is, modernism in English produced in Britain and the United States and by expatriates living abroad. However, a quick glance through such field-defining critics of modernism as Malcolm Bradbury and James McFarlane, Marshall Berman, Astradur Eiysteinsson, and Peter Nicholls makes evident that the modernism they delineate is itself polycentric and plural, with different nodal points of high energy and interconnection in the culture capitals of Europe, Britain, and the U.S.&#x2014;albeit with a limited continental scope. For many, the proper genealogy of this European modernism goes back to the Baudelaire of <i>Les Fleurs du Mal </i>in the 1840s&#x2013;1850s and the cosmopolitan flaneur of his essay "The Painter of Modern Life" .<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The temporal boundaries of modernism promoted by the Modernist Studies Association on its website reflect an Anglo-American and English language bias and thus do not even work for Western modernism. </p>

<p>The Modernist Studies Association's end date for modernism has an even more pernicious effect on modernisms outside the West. This periodization cuts off the agencies of writers, artists, philosophers, and other cultural producers in the emergent postcolonial world just as their new modernities are being formed. India's independence from Britain and the wrenching murder and displacement of millions in Partition that gave birth to two postcolonial nation-states happen in 1947&#x2013;1948. One after another of the colonies in the Caribbean and in Africa acquire liberation from official colonial rule in the 1950s and 1960s. The 1950s are the period of Frantz Fanon's brilliant indigenizations of European psychoanalysis to dissect the psychopathologies of colonial racism for both whites and blacks. <i>Black Skins, White Masks</i> is yet another manifestation of the phenomenology of the new and the now that defines a modern sensibility.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  To cite Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar from the epigraph once again, "to announce the general end of modernity even as an epoch . . . seems premature, if not patently ethnocentric, at a time when non-Western people everywhere begin to engage critically their own hybrid modernities." </p>

<p>Declaring the end of modernism by 1950 is like trying to hear one hand clapping. The modernisms of emergent modernities are that other hand that enables us to hear any clapping at all. As Walter Mignolo argues in the article from which the epigraph was taken, colonialism is constitutive of Western modernity, essential to its formation from the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries. As a consequence, we must not close the curtain on modernism before the creative agencies in the colonies and newly emergent nations have their chance to perform. Their nationalist movements and liberations from the political dimensions of colonial rule are central to the story of their modernities. Therefore, the creative forces within those modernities&#x2014;the writers, the artists, the musicians, the dancers, the philosophers, the critics, and so forth&#x2014;are engaged in producing modernisms that accompany their own particular modernities. To call their postliberation arts "postmodern"&#x2014;as they often are&#x2014;is to miss the point entirely. Multiple modernities create multiple modernisms. Multiple modernisms require respatializing and thus reperiodizing modernism.  </p>

<p>The centrality of colonialism and postcolonialism for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries requires a new geography of modernity and modernism, one based on an 

<b></b>

understanding of what the Caribbean poet and theorist Edouard Glissant calls a "poetics of relation" that produces "<i>creolit&#x00E9;</i>" or "the immeasurable intermixing of cultures."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Rather than positing a mosaic of different modernisms, each separated from all others by the fixed barriers of geopolitical and cultural borders around the world, I regard the boundaries between multiple modernisms as porous and permeable, fostering self/other confrontations and minglings as mutually constitutive, both <i>between</i> different societies and <i>within</i> them. This geography of mobility and interculturality is not a utopian fantasy of peaceful integration, but rather recognizes that the contact zones between cultures often involve violence and conquest as well as reciprocal exchange, inequality and exploitation as well as mutual benefits, and abjection and humiliation as well as pride and dignity. But the geography I advocate refuses victimology and assumes agency on all sides in the zones of encounter&#x2014;not autonomy, or the freedom to act unimpeded by others, but rather agency, the drive to name one's collective and individual identity and to negotiate the conditions of history, no matter how harsh.  </p>

<p>In aesthetic terms, this new geography involves a radical rewriting of what critics have called modernism's internationalism: its polylingualism and polyculturalism, its resistance to national culture, and its primitivist embrace of the non-Western Other as a means for revitalizing the various sterilities of the West. From Picasso to Stravinsky, from Pound to Eliot and Joyce, from the Dadaists to the Surrealists, the icons of modernism embody what many have regarded as "a supranational movement called International Modernism," to cite Hugh Kenner's well-known formulation in "The Making of the Modernist Canon."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Few would agree with Kenner's more outlandish statements in this essay that International Modernism is created solely by expatriate Americans and Irishmen writing in English or that writers like Virginia Woolf, William Carlos Williams, and William Faulkner are "provincial," not modernist. Indeed, the international modernism of critics like Bradbury and McFarlane or Berman is far more European-centered than Anglo-American. But however much the concepts of modernist internationalism differ from each other, they nonetheless typically operate within an unexamined center/periphery framework that locates the creative agency of modernity in the West.  </p>

<p>Whether acknowledged or not, prevailing concepts of modernist internationalism stage Western artists as the innovators and the cultures of the rest as tribal and traditional, as the raw material for creative appropriation and transmutation into modern art. With some notable exceptions&#x2014;the work of Simon Gikandi's <i>Writing in Limbo: Modernism and Caribbean Literature</i>, Charles W. Pollard's <i>New World Modernisms</i>, and Laura Doyle and Laura Winkiel's <i>Geomodernisms </i>come preeminently to mind&#x2014;the creative agencies of colonial and postcolonial subjects as producers of modernism have been largely ignored. The exclusion of these agencies deeply affects the definitional projects of modernist studies, producing circular overviews of modernism that reflect the absence of the very texts that would transform an understanding of the field in general.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The geographical blind spot of prevailing concepts of modernist internationalism is, in my view, a particular instance of what geographer J. M. Blaut more generally 

<b></b>

calls the ideology of European diffusionism. He defines this ideology as a narrative of modernity:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Europeans are seen as the "makers of history." Europe eternally advances, progresses, modernizes. The rest of the world advances more sluggishly, or stagnates: it is "traditional society." Therefore, the world has a permanent geographical center and a permanent periphery: an Inside and an Outside. Inside leads, Outside lags. Inside innovates, Outside imitates.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Blaut suggests that this storyline assumes a center/periphery model of modernity that arose in conjunction with Western imperialism as one of its major rationalizations for colonial rule. He details the evolution of this ideological formation from the beginning of the European conquests to its late twentieth-century formations. He argues that European diffusionism remains powerful today across the disciplines and the political spectrum, from the Marxist world-systems theory of Immanuel Wallerstein and his disciples to the neo-conservatives like Samuel Huntington and his followers bemoaning the "clash of civilizations." For Wallerstein, modernity is a Western virus whose spread infects the rest of the world; for Huntington, the Other is a pollutant that threatens the West. For both, however, modernity is an autonomous Western invention. Whether condemned or lionized, modernization is for both camps synonymous with Westernization.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The conventional periodization of modernism is, I believe, an instance of this Eurocentric diffusionist ideology&#x2014;whether found among those critics committed to a notion of Western aesthetic exceptionalism, or those who see emergent national literatures outside the West as either derivative of or entirely separate from modernism. As I argued in a plenary address for the inaugural MSA conference in 1999, the new geography of modernism needs to locate many centers of modernity across the globe, to focus on the cultural traffic linking them, and to interpret the circuits of reciprocal influence and transformation that take place within highly unequal state relations.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  More recently, Pollard theorizes what he calls "New World modernisms" that are neither purely European nor purely indigenous. Featuring Glissant's concepts of creolization and a poetics of relation, Pollard theorizes nomadic trajectories for various modernisms that dismantle the notion of European centers and colonial peripheries: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Glissant subsequently extends this idea of creolization to a "new global level" in developing his "poetics of relation". . . . Glissant defines this term by offering a simple historical narrative of the trajectories of cultural exchange, first a trajectory from the center to the peripheries, then a movement from the peripheries to the center, and finally, in the "poetics of relation," the "trajectory is abolished" and the "poet's word" reproduces a "circular nomadism; that is, it makes every periphery into a center; . . . it abolishes the very notion of center and periphery."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Pollard's contribution is to link Glissant's poetics of relation directly to issues of modernism, positing the existence of a "discrepant cosmopolitan modernism" that refuses the common linkages between postcolonialism and postmodernism. By juxtaposing 

<b></b>

T. S. Eliot with Derek Walcott and Kamau Braithwaite, Pollard illustrates more generally "how modernism has migrated as a cultural ideal and how it has changed through this migration."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>   </p>

<p><i>Geomodernisms: Race, Modernism, Modernity</i>, edited by Laura Doyle and Laura Winkiel, goes even further than Pollard in theorizing a departure from conventional periodizations and the resultant locations of modernism. Doyle and Winkiel call for a global approach to modernism and modernity that goes well beyond the linked trajectories of colonizing metropole and colonized peripheries: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>To emplace modernism in this way&#x2014;to think . . . in terms of interconnected modernisms&#x2014;requires a rethinking of periodization, genealogies, affiliations, and forms. To some degree, this rethinking estranges the category of modernism itself. The term <i>modernism</i> breaks open, into something we call geomodernisms, which signals a locational approach to modernisms' engagement with cultural and political discourses of global modernity. The revelation of such an approach is double. It unveils both unsuspected "modernist" experiments in "marginal" texts and unsuspected correlations between those texts and others that appear either more conventional or more postmodern.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Recognizing modernisms on a planetary landscape involves identification of intensified and proliferating contact zones that set in motion often radical juxtapositions of difference and consequent intermixing of cultural forms that can be alternately embraced, violently imposed, or imperceptibly evolved. Traveling and intermixing cultures are not unidirectional, but multidirectional; not linear influences, but reciprocal ones; not passive assimilations, but actively transformative ones, based in a blending of adaptation and resistance. All modernisms develop as a form of cultural translation or transplantation produced through intercultural encounters. As Edward Said puts it in reference to traveling theory, "Such movement into a new environment is never unimpeded. It necessarily involves processes of representation and institutionalization different from those at the point of origin. This complicates any account of the transplantation, transference, circulation, and commerce of theories and ideas."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Over time, Said concludes, "the now full (or partly) accommodated (or incorporated) idea is to some extent transformed by its new uses, its new position in a new time and place."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In "Traveling Theory Revisited," Said goes even further to argue that in traveling and transplanting elsewhere, theory&#x2014;particularly Western theory traveling to the colonies&#x2014;often becomes stronger and more radical, based on "an affiliation in the deepest and most interesting sense of the word." Instead of being derivative or diluted, this theory can have "its fiery core . . . reignited" and invigorated.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Terms for cultural translation and adaptation abound, and I have been collecting, sorting, and analyzing them as keywords that convey different resonances for the complexities of global interculturality.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  But for my purposes in this essay, I want to highlight <i>indigenization</i>&#x2014;a form of making <i>native</i> or <i>indigenous</i> something from elsewhere. Indigenization presumes an affinity of some sort between the cultural practices from elsewhere and those in the indigenizing location. Hostile soil does not allow transplantation to take hold; conversely, the practices that take hold in their new 

<b></b>

location are changed in the process. Anthropologist Anna Tsing likens this paradoxical relationship to the "friction" that allows movement: the earth's resistance to the wheel that allows the wheel to turn. "I stress the importance of cross-cultural and long-distance encounters in everything we know as culture," she writes. "Cultures are continually co-produced in the interactions I call 'friction': the awkward, unequal, unstable, and creative quality of interconnection across difference."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  <i>Friction</i> carries with it the connotations of conflict and serves as an apt metaphor for interculturality in colonial and postcolonial contexts. </p>

<p>The terms <i>indigenization </i>and <i>nativization</i> additionally suggest a kind of cultural cannibalism, if you will, an ingestion of the other which transforms both the cannibal and the cannibalized. This association of modernity with indigenization, nativization, and cannibalism appears to fly in the face of the conventional association of these terms with the traditional and primitive. But because I regard tradition as the invention of modernity, as part of modernity's fashioning of its own rupture from the past, I like the contradictions these terms suggest. Indigenization reminds us that modernity involves a forgetting of origins, a claiming of cultural practices from elsewhere as so much one's own that the history of their travels is often lost. Moreover, I echo here deliberately the modernist manifesto of Brazilian writer Oswald de Andrade, whose 1928 "Manifesto antropofago" ("Anthropophagist Manifesto") invokes his cannibal ancestors the Tupinamba Indians, who ate the early European explorers, to develop his metaphor of the New World modernism in its relation to European modernism. As John King puts it, "For Oswald de Andrade, Brazilian artists should similarly take on the powers of the colonizers, through ingestion, producing in this way an artistic practice that was very much their own."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Like Western modernities, colonialism greatly enabled the development of Western modernisms formed through the indigenization of cultural practices from elsewhere. Conversely, colonized subjects indigenized Western modernity and modernism in forming their own modernities within the inequitable framework of colonial power and resistance.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The inflow and outflow of cultural forms was constitutive of modernity and modernism for both the imperial and colonized centers, though with significant differences. The inflow of non-Western art into the West as foundational for European modernism has been much studied, especially in relation to European primitivism&#x2014;as in the case of Picasso's borrowings of African art in the formation of Cubism, which art historian William Rubin described as a "cannibalization" that served as a "countercultural battering ram" enabling his "attack on European bourgeois aesthetic sensibility."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>   </p>

<p>But because of the prevailing periodization of modernism, the indigenizations of Western aesthetics into colonial and post-colonial settings engaged in their own emergent modernities have not typically been considered modernist. For some, modernism is a purely Western aesthetic and as a category has no explanatory power for postcolonial writing. Why bother, Barbara Harlow once asked me, to consider Tayeb Salih, the Sudan's leading novelist and author of the 1967 novel <i>Season of Migration to the North</i>, a modernist? Leave modernism to the Europeans and Anglo-Americans, she 

<b></b>

insisted; literatures of newly emergent postcolonial nation-states have everything to do with the ongoing effects of colonialism and little or nothing to do with modernism. For others, committed to the project of what Dipesh Chakrabarty calls "provincializing Europe," the modernity of colonial and post-colonial sites is irremediably "derivative" or "belated," a form of "colonial mimicry" which at best denaturalizes Western modernity by highlighting the artifice of its construction.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In his otherwise splendid introduction to <i>Alternative Modernities</i>, Gaonkar begins his genealogy of modernism&#x2014;which he defines as the cultural dimension of modernity&#x2014;with none other than Baudelaire as an originary point, thus setting himself up for yet another version of the diffusionist story and the post-colonial lament of being caught in the reactive position of belatedness.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In contrast to these views, R. Radhakrishnan insists that the task for postcoloniality is "to find a way out of the curse of 'derivativeness.'" He does so first by pointing out that "there is nothing that is not derivative," including the West's modernity, and secondly by advocating the recognition of "alternative, alterior, heterogeneous, hybrid, and polycentric modernities."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  To Radhakrishnan's argument about modernity, I would add the necessity for finding a way out of the curse of presumed derivativeness for non-Western modernisms. These modernisms are different, not derivative. Like the modernisms of the West, they are hybrid, evidencing signs of traveling modernisms that have transplanted and become native. </p>

<p>A planetary approach to modernism requires, in my view, jettisoning the ahistorical designation of modernism as a collection of identifiable aesthetic styles, and abandoning as well the notion of modernism as an aesthetic period whose singular temporal beginning and endpoints are determinable, however interminable the debates might be about them. Instead, I regard modernism as the <i>expressive dimension of modernity</i>, one that encompasses a range of styles among creative forms that share family resemblances based on an engagement with the historical conditions of modernity in a particular location. Multiple modernisms emergent in the context of modernities located across a global landscape has a profound effect on historical periodization. Instead of looking for the <i>single</i> period of modernism, with its (always debatable) beginning and end points, we need to locate the <i>plural</i> periods of modernisms, some of which overlap with each other and others of which have a different time period altogether. </p>

Modernism as the Expressive Dimension of Modernity
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Defining modernism as the expressive dimension of modernity, wherever it occurs on the planet and in whatever particular form, appears to beg the question, to be a tautological statement with little explanatory power. What, after all, <i>is</i> modernity? Does the term <i>modernity </i>lose specificity in being broadened beyond its conventional meaning of what happened in the West after 1500 (for example, capitalism, nation-state formation, imperialism, Enlightenment, Industrialization, et cetera)?<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Does every period in history lay claim to being <i>modern</i>, and if so, doesn't the term become meaningless? If <i>modernity </i>lacks particularity as a concept, then the claim that <i>modernism </i>is modernity's 

<b></b>

expressive domain is necessarily emptied of specificity as well. If all periods are <i>modern</i>, then all aesthetic expression must be <i>modernist</i>. A definitional category has meaning only on the basis of the inclusion of some phenomena and the exclusion of others. Without some principle of inside/outside, the category <i>qua</i> category collapses into uselessness. In "Definitional Excursions: The Meanings of <i>Modern/Modernity/Modernism</i>," I resisted definition, instead advocating an interrogation of the definitional dissonances of the debate itself as well as the radical disjuncture between how these terms are used across the disciplines. But for my claim here about modernism to have any explanatory significance, I recognize that some provisional definition of modernity is necessary. In tune with the earlier essay's critique of nominal definitions of modernity as perniciously Eurocentric and singular, my strategic definition of modernity here is relational, emphasizing the temporal rupture of before/after wherever and whenever such ruptures might occur in time and space. </p>

<p>Let me be clear: I do not regard every historical period as "modern"; nor do I regard every creative expression produced in the context of modernity to be "modernist." In defining modernism as the expressive dimension of modernity, I mean to suggest a range of creative meaning-making forms and cultural practices that engage in substantial and different ways with the historical conditions of a particular modernity. That said, I still need to provide some definition of modernity, no matter how provisional and porous the conceptual boundaries. I advocate a polycentric, planetary concept of modernity that can be both precise enough to be useful and yet capacious enough to encompass the divergent articulations of modernity in various geohistorical locations. I suggest that modernity involves a powerful vortex of historical conditions that coalesce to produce sharp ruptures from the past that range widely across various sectors of a given society. The velocity, acceleration, and dynamism of shattering change across a wide spectrum of societal institutions are key components of modernity as I see it&#x2014;change that interweaves the cultural, economic, political, religious, familial, sexual, aesthetic, technological, and so forth, and can move in both utopic and dystopic directions. Across the vast reaches of civilizational history, eruptions of different modernities often occur in the context of empires and conquest. This definitional approach recognizes the modernities that have formed not only after the rise of the West but also before the West's post-1500 period of rapid change&#x2014;the earlier modernities of the Tang Dynasty in China, the Abbasid Dynasty of the Muslim empire, and the Mongol Empire, to cite just a few.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Moreover, modernity is often associated with the intensification of intercultural contact zones, whether produced through conquest, vast migrations of people (voluntary or forced), or relatively peaceful commercial traffic and technological or cultural exchange. Indeed, heightened hybridizations, jarring juxtapositions, and increasingly porous borders both characterize modernity and help bring it into being. The speed and scope of widespread transformation often leads to what Marshall Berman calls (citing Marx) the sensation that "all that is solid melts into air," and what I call the phenomenology of the new and the now.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Modernity has a self-reflexive, experiential dimension that includes a gamut of sensations from displacement, despair, and nostalgia 

<b></b>

to exhilaration, hope, and embrace of the new&#x2014;a range that depends in part on the conrations of power and the utopic versus dystopic directions of change.  </p>

<p>Understood as an umbrella term, modernity has a complex and contradictory relationship to its seeming opposite&#x2014;"tradition" or "history." Modernity and tradition are relational concepts that modernity produces to cut itself off from the past, to distinguish the "now" from the "then." Modernity invents tradition, suppresses its own continuities with the past, and often produces nostalgia for what has been seemingly lost. Tradition forms at the moment those who perceive it regard themselves as cut off from it.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Modernity's dislocating break with the past also engenders a radical reaction in the opposite direction. As a result, periods of modernity often contain tremendous battles between "modernizers" and "traditionalists," those who promote the modern and those who want to restore an imagined and often idealized past. Indeed, in my view, the struggle between modernizing and traditionalizing forces within a given society is itself a defining characteristic of modernity. In this sense, past-oriented traditionalism is as much a feature of modernity as modernization. Moreover, modernity also produces what Paul de Man calls (citing Nietzsche) "a ruthless forgetting" of the past: "Modernity exists in the form of a desire to wipe out whatever came earlier."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The past that is repressed, that will not be remembered, comes back to haunt and trouble the present. Buried within the radical ruptures from the past are hidden continuities&#x2014;all the things that refuse to change or cannot change, often having to do with the uneven distributions of power and violent histories. </p>

<p>In this context, the notion of derivative postcolonial modernities contains an implicit and misleading binary that sets up the West as modern and the Rest as traditional, struggling to reject its traditionalism in favor of becoming modern, which by a subtle metonymic slide is the equivalent of becoming Western. While there is no doubt that many colonial subjects experience the humiliations and ambivalence of this modernity/tradition opposition, this phenomenological dimension of modernity reflects the ideological force of the diffusionist myth and obscures both the traditionalisms within the West and the indigenous modernities outside the West. Instead, we need to look for the interplay of modernity and tradition <i>within</i> each location, that is, within both the West and the regions outside the West.  </p>

<p>Broadening the provisional definition in these ways presumes a pluralization of modernity. As Gaonkar puts it, "modernity is not one, but many." He challenges what he calls the "acultural theory" of modernity which posits "the inexorable march of modernity [that] will end up making all cultures look alike." He promotes instead what he calls a "cultural theory," one that "holds that modernity always unfolds within a specific culture or civilizational context."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Gaonkar is one among a growing number of theorists and historians who are calling for a new discourse about modernity, one based on an acknowledgement of "multiple modernities," "early modernities," "alternate modernities," "polycentric modernities" or "conjunctural modernities"&#x2014;to cite some of the current terms in use.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  This approach typically assumes that each manifestation of modernity is distinctive and yet affiliated through global linkages to other modernities or societal formations. Sanjay Subrahmanyam terms this concept of global link

<b></b>

ages "conjunctural." Countering Wallerstein's metaphor of modernity as the "virus" of capitalism spreading from the exploitative West to the Rest, Subrahmanyam writes that "modernity is a global and <i>conjunctural</i> phenomenon, not a virus that spreads from one place to another. It is located in a series of historical processes that brought relatively isolated societies into contact."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Multiple modernities, in short, involve global weblike formations, with many multidirectional links, affiliations, and often brutal inequities of power. They are not mosaics, each modernity separate and isolated from all others, evolving autonomously and equally. And yet they are not the same either, as each reflects the particular indigenizations of its own location.  </p>

<p>This provisional approach to modernity engenders a parallel approach to modernism as the expressive dimension of any given modernity. Polycentric modernities produce polycentric modernisms, ones which are simultaneously distinctive and yet produced through indigenizations of traveling modernities that take place within frequently extreme differences of power. This dynamic is particularly true for the modernisms developing out of colonialism and its demise throughout the century. Theorizing modernism in this way fundamentally alters the conventional end points of twentieth-century modernism. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
<i>Season of Migration to the North</i> as a Modernist Novel
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Spatializing modernism across a polycentric landscape allows us to include Tayeb Salih's postcolonial novel <i>Season of Migration to the North </i>within the canon of twentieth-century modernisms. One of the best known contemporary novels in Arabic, completed by the Sudan's leading writer during his exile in Beirut, <i>Season of Migration to the North</i> appeared in 1967 and then in English translation in 1969.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  As a novel that echoes, reverses, and affiliates with Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness, Season of Migration to the North</i> thematizes the enmeshing of both European and African modernities with colonialism and the seeming ruptures brought about by the demise of European imperialism and the rise of new African nation-states like the Sudan. But Salih's novel challenges both the modernity of the West and the postcolonialism of the Sudan by deconstructing the familiar binaries of West/Rest, modern/traditional, and innovative/imitative. Instead, he shows each location as imitative of the other; each, in other words, is engaged in mimetic encounters that intermix the modern and traditional as constitutive of modernity itself in its different locations. Women&#x2014;specifically, attraction to them, violence against them, and women's own engagements with modernity&#x2014;re centrally in his complex staging of intercultural encounters. </p>

<p>As echo to <i>Heart of Darkness,Season of Migration to the North </i>reverses the journey of Kurtz from Europe to Africa. Mustafa Sa'eed is a brilliant Sudanese prodigy who journeys from the South to the North, early in the century, into the heart of the colonial metropolis&#x2014;first to Khartoum, then to Cairo, and finally to London and Oxford. Like <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, Mustafa's tale is mostly told by one main narrator, who, like Marlow, becomes ever more clearly unreliable and heavily ironized. Even more than Conrad's novel, <i>Season of Migration to the North</i> is a narrative of indeterminacy; of 

<b></b>

mysteries, lies, and truths; of mediating events through the perspectives of multiple embedded narrators; of complex tapestries of interlocking motifs and symbols; and of pervasive irony.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Stylistically speaking, Salih's novel is "high modernist," having moved even further than Conrad from the conventions of realism.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Just as Kurtz exceeded expectations as a colonial agent, Mustafa is a great success in Britain. There, he acquires degrees and becomes the darling of the British left, writing books and advising ministers on economics and development in the Empire. In a love/hate relationship with the culture that exoticizes him, he turns into "the black Englishman," infected with the disease of those he lives among, much as Kurtz had "gone native" in the Congo. He seduces scores of white women, "modern" women whose Orientalist fantasies he exploits and exposes as a form of modern longing for pre-modern desert Arab or black primitive prince. He hunts them like prey, driving two to suicide and murdering the last, his wife, the one he loves, in a sadomasochistic orgy.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  In a fit of liberal guilt, the English court lets him off with a light sentence, buying into the myth of the colonized victim and denying him the dignity of free will and moral responsibility for his actions. In disgust, Mustafa migrates back to the Sudan, selecting a village at the bend of the Nile, where he appears out of nowhere one day to buy land, farm, marry a local woman, and find partial acceptance as the stranger with a hidden past he shares with no one, until he tells a part of his story to the nameless narrator. One day, after making sure his affairs are in order, he mysteriously disappears. The villagers assume he drowned in the seasonal flooding of the Nile, either by accident or suicide, but a tale also surfaces in Khartoum that he secretly returned to Britain. In the penultimate chapter of the novel, the narrator opens the secret room Mustafa had kept hidden from everyone. The room is a replica in the desert of a British gentleman's library, complete with hundreds of books and a fireplace over which hangs a portrait of his dead white wife. In shock and despair, the narrator goes swimming in the Nile, heading for the northern shore; and although he chooses to live rather than drown, the novel leaves us hanging, as unsure of his final fate as we are of Mustafa's. </p>

<p>In an interview, Salih explains Mustafa's state of mind in terms of sexualized postcolonial revenge."In Europe," Salih notes, "there is the idea of dominating us."  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>That domination is associated with sex. ratively speaking, Europe raped Africa in a violent fashion. Mustafa Sa'eed, the hero of the novel, used to react to that domination with an opposite reaction, which had an element of revenge seeking. In his violent female conquests he wants to inflict on Europe the degradation which it had imposed upon his people. He wants to rape Europe in a metaphorical fashion.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Many have assumed that Mustafa's views are Salih's own. But the novel ultimately refuses such simple binaries of North/South, colonizer/colonized, and modernity/tradition. Instead, Salih unveils the interplay of oppositions in both Britain and the Sudan, exploding in particular the association of modernity with the West and tradition with Africa. Establishing an ironic distance between himself and both the narrator and Mustafa, Salih exposes the way "tradition" is always in a process of change and "modernity" is never as complete a rejection of the past as it seems. North and South are not so 

<b></b>

much opposites as they are mutually constitutive, existing in conjunctural relationship, both <i>between </i>nations and <i>within </i>nations. Gender and sexuality are the forces that explode the illusion of absolute difference. Salih indigenizes Conrad's trope of journey to the heart of otherness as a means of exposing the darkness at home. The steamer's progress up the Congo river in Conrad's tale exposes the hypocrisy of European (or at least Belgian) imperialism in the Congo; the journey north in Salih's novel uncovers not only the diseased traditionalism of the North but also the brutalizing tradition in the Sudanese village on the Nile. To understand the novel in this way, we must be attuned to the novel's pervasive modernist irony and its subtle undermining of illusion in both North and South. </p>

<p>The novel's village is not what the narrator and Mustafa imagine it to be&#x2014;a changeless, simple, gracious place.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  There are signs of change everywhere, represented symptomatically in the novel by the steady beat of the "puttering pumps" that have replaced the older water-wheels. Moreover, Mustafa's "rape" through seduction of white women in the North has its counterpart in a terrifying rape in the village which is sanctioned by tradition. Mustafa's widow Hosna, a thoroughly "modern" woman in the context of the village, has refused to accept any suitors for her hand and instead makes known her desire for the narrator. She even approaches the narrator's father and tells him to instruct his son to marry her. The narrator's mother is scandalized: "What an impudent hussy! That's modern women for you!" (<i>SMN</i>, 123). Afraid of his own desire for Hosna, the narrator agrees to do what he profoundly disapproves of: approach Hosna on behalf of the old village lecher and close friend of his grandfather, Wad Rayyes, who is determined to marry Hosna. As the narrator's friend later tells him, "The world hasn't changed as much as you think. . . . Some things have changed&#x2014;pumps instead of water-wheels, iron ploughs instead of wooden ones, sending our daughters to school, radios, cars, learning to drink whisky and beer instead of arak and millet wine&#x2014;yet even so everything's as it was. . . . Women belong to men and a man's a man even if he's decrepit" (<i>SMN</i>, 99&#x2013;101). </p>

<p>Modernization of water-wheels is one thing, but modern women must be resisted. The result is catastrophic, ripping apart the seemingly placid and changeless surface of the village to reveal the brutality within. Hosna is forcibly married and manages to fend off the attacks of her new husband until one night when villagers hear her screams and do nothing to interfere, only to discover the pair dead and covered in blood. Hosna does what she tells the narrator she will do&#x2014;kill Wad Rayyes if she is forced to marry him. Then she kills herself. The village, Salih reveals, is a site of partial modernization, a growing modernity that does not incorporate its girls and women, its family institutions. Rape is not just a metaphor for colonial exploitation and postcolonial revenge. Rape is also what happens when "women belong to men." Hosna's city ways&#x2014;her modernity&#x2014; arouse not only the narrator, who is afraid to act, but also the old man whose desire to possess her seems to be an allegory for the resistance to modernity itself. Lest one think of Hosna's action as a simple importation of Western ways into the village, the reaction of Wad Rayyes's elder wife to the story of his death is a chilling warning: "Good riddance!", she says, and at his funeral she "gave trilling cries of joy" 

<b></b>

(<i>SMN,</i> 128). The roots of gender modernization in the village lie in the suffering of its women and their own longing for freedom from tyranny in the family.  </p>

<p>Salih further deconstructs the binary of (European) North and (African) South by using the issue of gender relations to expose the North/South power divide <i>within</i> the Sudan itself, a long-standing ethnic and religious divide that led to decades of civil war between the dominant Arab and Muslim North and the dominated non-Arab and Christian/animist South. Salih highlights the North's enslavement of women from the South in particular to break open North/South binaries based solely on colonialism. Mustafa's mother, we learn, was a slave from the South, a fact that might explain her striking coldness toward her son. Moreover, Wad Rayyes regales the narrator's grandfather and his friends in the village with the story of his kidnapping "a young slave girl from down-river" whom he delights in raping over and over again (<i>SMN</i>, 74). That friends laugh in pleasure at his bawdy tale just days before he rapes Hosna heightens the novel's ironic exposure of violence within the seemingly placid surface of village life and allegorizes the North/South divisions within the Sudan.  </p>

<p>In so doing, Salih indigenizes Conrad's project in <i>Heart of Darkness</i> to expose the hypocrisy of European imperialism's so-called civilizing mission in Africa and the reality of its greed and bestiality. Salih, like Conrad, exposes the heart of darkness at home, centered in the Sudan's gender and ethnic/religious differences. Beneath the hypocrisy of serene village life in Salih's novel lies the hidden brutality of the village's ambivalent relationship to modernity and its refusal to incorporate the security and freedom of its women in its future. The traditionalism of Salih's "modern" narrator, the postcolonial government agent from Khartoum who is too timid to support Hosna's bid for freedom, has its parallel in Marlow's gender traditionalism at the end of <i>Heart of Darkness</i> when he refuses to tell the Intended the truth about Kurtz's last words. In maintaining her illusions about Kurtz's idealism, Marlow performs the traditional role of the man who protects the delicate woman from the harsh realities of life and thus sustains his own need for masculine mastery. Irony in both novels unravels the overlapping oppositions between modernity/tradition, north/south, and man/woman.  </p>

<p>The juxtaposition of <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and <i>Season of Migration to the North </i>breaks down the conventional narrative of modernism as the invention of the West imitated by the Rest. It shows how a polycentric approach to modernity and modernism reveals the way that each site&#x2014;in Britain and in Africa&#x2014;is constructed through engagement with the other. Further, each site also exhibits a key feature of modernity: the struggle between modernizing and traditionalizing forces for which women and particularly the violence done to them exposes, indeed explodes the cultural narratives of both rational progress and nostalgic tradition. Like Said's notion of the colonial intensification of the colonizer's traveling theory in "Traveling Theory Reconsidered," Salih's modernist exposure of the violent traditionalisms at the heart of both North and South is not so much derivative of Conrad as it is a sharper and more focused attack on the gender systems of both the colonizer and the colonized. Salih's affiliation with Conrad leads to an indigenization of his tale in which "its fiery core" (to echo Said again) has been reignited with a vengeance.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Moreover, reading <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and <i>Season of Migration to the North</i> in conjunction as the expressive dimensions of colonial and postcolonial modernities suggests that cutting off modernism in the 1940s does a violence to the postcolonial text and postcolonial modernisms that reproduces in the symbolic domain the broader violence of colonialism itself. The 1940s end date for modernism in effect refuses to hear what the later modernisms have to say about the modernities that have shaped and been shaped by colonialism and its aftermath throughout the twentieth century. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Conclusion
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Whether conceived as a loose affiliation of aesthetic styles or as a literary/artistic historical "period" with at least debatable beginning and end points, modernism contains an unacknowledged spatial politics that suppresses the global dimensions of modernism through time, and the interplay of space and time in all modernisms. As Marshall Brown writes about the problematics of literary periodization, "the art lies in the cutting." Cutting off the end of modernism in the 1940s is an "art" that is also a "politics." It obscures the central role that colonialism played in the formation of modernism in both colonizing and colonized cultures, and it completely suppresses the agencies of those writers and artists who engage with postcolonial modernities after the 1940s. We do not, I believe, reduce the concepts of modernity and modernism to categories that are so inclusive as to be meaningless by theorizing the geohistory of twentieth-century modernism as I have been doing. Instead, we gain a greater sense of the possible modernist particularities that develop in different locations and times in history.  </p>

<p>To spatialize the literary history of modernism requires the abandonment of diffusionist ideologies of innovative centers and imitative peripheries. It requires as well the recognition that the "periods" of modernism are multiple and that modernism is alive and thriving wherever the historical convergence of radical rupture takes place. Always spatialize! But remember: spatialization means reperiodizations. Recognizing the "emplacement" of modernisms, to echo Laura Doyle and Laura Winkiel in their introduction to <i>Geomoderisms</i>, expands the planetary landscape of modernism at the same time that it retains attention to the creative forms of engagement with modernities whenever and wherever they occur. </p>

<p>Hurry up, please.  </p>

<p>It's time for the Modernist Studies Association to change the organization's periodization of modernism in its official description if it wants to reflect the work actually being done under its umbrella. More broadly speaking, it's time as well for modernist studies to expand the horizons of time. </p>

Like many social theorists, Moses argues that modernization causes global homogenization, and he regards the pre-modern and the traditional in the Third World as forces of resistance to modernity's homogenizing.

Salih's narrator, educated in England and working in Khartoum for the new nation-state, exhibits many of these same "modern" traits, exoticizing (indeed, Orientalizing) the Bedouin women he sees dancing in the desert in the much-discussed desert caravan sequence (<i>MSN</i>, 108&#x2013;15) and romanticizing what he sees as the stability of the village.</p>

<p id="lead">Sometime in the early 1960s, David Rubadiri, a Malawian student and then lecturer at Makerere University College in Uganda published a poem entitled "Stanley Meets Mutesa." The poem, one of the most anthologized in collections of African poetry, had a theme that was familiar in the early days of postcolonial literature: the encounter between Europe and Africa, the colonizer and the colonized. Rubadiri's poem, in both its key theme and movement, drew heavily on the history of late-nineteenth-century colonialism in East Africa, more particularly the arrival of the Anglo-American imperialist, Henry Morton Stanley, to the Kingdom of Buganda. The poem is, indeed, most memorable in its last stanza, which allegorizes the entry of the west in the world of the other:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>"Mtu mweupe karibu" <br />
White man you are welcome, <br />
The gate of reeds closes behind them  <br />
And the west is let in.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p>These, the last four lines of the poem, have come to signal the doubleness of the postcolonial literary project, namely the imperative to mark a space of local identity in the language of the other and to reroute the signifiers of colonialism. Rubadiri's poem is in English, except the one line that signals the entry of the colonizer&#x2014;"Mtu mweupe karibu"&#x2014;which is in Swahili. Significantly, Rubadiri does not let this line stand out as the mark of African identity or self-inscription; in fact the line that follows&#x2014;"White man you are welcome"&#x2014;is a direct translation 

<b></b>

of the line in Swahili. The colonial event is thus represented as a form of alien invasion, which is, nevertheless, controlled through linguistic gestures. For Rubadiri and many of his contemporaries, it was in this play of alienation and identification that postcolonial difference would be inscribed.  </p>

<p>Beneath the allegorization of the colonial encounter, however, there was something else happening in Rubadiri's poem: it was recounting the African encounter with Europe, and indeed recuperating that fatal moment of history when Stanley met Mutesa, in the language of modernism. A remarkable but often forgotten feature of Rubadiri's celebrated poem is how its denotation of an African version of history is effected through the language of high modernism. This is evident in the very first stanza of the poem, which recounts Stanley's journey through the African landscape:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Such a time of it they had <br />
The heat of the day <br />
The chill of the night <br />
And the mosquitoes <br />
That day and night <br />
Trailed the march bound for a kingdom.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Readers of these lines will, of course, recognize the influence of T. S. Eliot. In its structure, rhythm, and imagery, "Stanley Meets Mutesa" borrows heavily from Eliot's "The Journey of the Magi." The above stanza bears a striking similarity to the famous opening of Eliot's poem: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>"A cold coming we had of it, <br />
Just the worst time of the year <br />
For a journey, and such a long journey: <br />
The ways deep and the weather sharp, <br />
The very dead of winter."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p>The great irony of the history of postcolonial literatures was the emulation of high modernists, such as Eliot and Yeats, as formal models. This emulation was explicit, as the poetry of Rubadiri and Christopher Okigbo illustrates, but it could also be indirect and epigraphic, as in Chinua Achebe's derivation of a title and epigraph from Yeat's "Second Coming" for <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, and from "The Journey of the Magi" in <i>No Longer at Ease</i>. As the essays in this special issue of  vividly illustrate, a convergence of political and literary ideologies mark a significant part of the history of modernism and postcolonialism. Indeed, it is my contention that it was primarily&#x2014;I am tempted to say solely&#x2014;in the language and structure of modernism that a postcolonial experience came to be articulated and imagined in literary form. The archive of early postcolonial writing in Africa, the Caribbean, and India is dominated and defined by writers whose political or cultural projects were enabled by modernism even when the ideologies of the latter, as was the case with Eliot, were at odds with the project of decolonization.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Eliot's "The Journey of the Magi" did not attract African 

<b></b>

and Caribbean writers because of its high Anglicanist bent; rather, it was the structure of the journey, the revised dramatic monologue, and the use of classical allusions that an emergent postcolonial aesthetic found appealing.  </p>

<p>Still, it is fair to say that the history of late modernity, both in the West and in the postcolonies, has been marked by continuing ambivalence toward the relationship between the aesthetic ideology of high modernism and the spaces of the colonial and postcolonial other. Whether we look at it from the perspective of high European culture in the period after World War II, or from the vantage point of postcoloniality in the same period, debates about modernism are marked by a double paradox. The first paradox lies at the root of the recovery and institution of modernism in the twentieth century: modernism represents perhaps the most intense and unprecedented site of encounter between the institutions of European cultural production and the cultural practices of colonized peoples. It is rare to find a central text in modern literature, art, or ethnography that does not deploy the other as a significant source, influence, or informing analogy. And the relationship between the institution of modernism and these other cultural spaces is not, as was the case in earlier periods of European art, decorative: it is dynamic, dialectical, and constitutive of the field of European and American culture.  </p>

<p>Indeed, what differentiates modernism from other European encounters with the cultural spaces and practices of the colonized is the recognition, by modern writers and artists, that those others could, even in economies of difference and Eurocentrism, provide important lessons for a new ideology of art. This point has, of course, been the subject of revisionist works on the history of modernism. The paradox, though, is that in spite of this visible engagement with the culture of the other, modernism is now remembered and recycled in the public culture&#x2014;in the museums, mausoleums and libraries built by a powerful and wealthy cultural elite&#x2014;as the art of exclusiveness. Indeed, the modern art museum has become a mechanism for policing the boundaries between modernism, now redefined as the emblem of European high culture, and the messier, lower, cultures that enabled it.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The association between modernism and an exclusive elite culture leads to a second paradox: for almost fifty years, postcolonial critics and scholars have treated modernism with suspicion. Indeed, it is fair to say that postcolonial criticism has posited modernism as the site of Eurocentric danger, a threat to the assumed authenticity of the cultural and literary traditions of postcolonial polities. Quite often, modernism has been seen as the art form of an alienated cultural elite, eager to master European form at the expense of local traditions of writing and thus placed at odds with the political project of decolonization.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The paradox here, of course, is that without modernism, postcolonial literature as we know it would perhaps not exist. This is a bold claim to make, and I am sure it will be debated and disputed by many postcolonial scholars.  </p>

<p>But consider these simple facts. There is not much literature in the European languages in either Africa, the Caribbean, or India before the advent of modernism. While there is no simple explanation for this paucity, it can be directly connected to the operations of the English canon propagated by the colonial school and university 

<b></b>

as both sacred and inimitable. Colonial subjects were avid consumers of the canon, but within the colonial institutions of interpretation, they were taught that this canon represented the values of an innate Englishness, one that was anterior to their own sense of self, as lesser subjects of empire. One could read English texts to have a glimpse of the superiority of English culture; one could imagine what Chaucer's road to Canterbury may have looked like; one could struggle to visualize the daffodil in Wordsworth's poems; but eventually one would have to accept that those experiences were beyond one's measure. Reflecting on why West Indian writers of his generation had to leave the Caribbean in order to become writers, the Barbadian novelist, George Lamming, noted that they had to leave because in the colonial conception of literature books were "not supposed to be-written by natives": "Those among the natives who read also believed that; for all the books they had read, their whole introduction to something called culture, all of it, in the form of words, came from outside: Dickens, Jane Austen, Kipling and that 'sacred gang.' "<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  </p>

<p>It is when modernism was introduced into the canon, sometimes reluctantly, that postcolonial creativity bloomed. For example, the renaissance of African writing at the end of the 1950s started at University College, Ibadan, and University College, Makerere (both branches of the University of London) when two expatriate lecturers&#x2014;Molly Mahood and David Cooke&#x2014;introduced young African students to the literature of modernism in the 1950s. Although Mahood had been seconded to Ibadan as a Shakespearean, she sponsored a literary magazine called <i>New Horn</i> devoted to literary experimentation, using modernist poems as models. It was here that young poets such as J. P. Clarke, Wole Soyinka, and Christopher Okigbo used the model of modernism to create a postcolonial African literature.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>   </p>

<p>There are three narratives involved in the transnational reach of modernism, and this special issue of  captures them well. The first is how modernism, as a transnational phenomenon, invites a reconration of the time and space of modernity. Many of the essays here illustrate what happens when critical energy is directed at the roles played by ostensible margins in the constitution of cultural centers. All the essays in this collection provide compelling, reversionary accounts of modernism outside its traditional boundaries. And when it is placed in an uneasy relation to other spaces, modernism seems to recover its drive as the aesthetic of the international avant-garde and in the process to reject its ossification as the aesthetic ideology of high European culture. In "Periodizing Modernism," for example, Susan Friedman reconres the dialectic of periodicity in modernism, dispersing what was once assumed to be its obsessive preoccupation with time by confronting it with the presence and pressures of other spaces. Similarly, in "Modernist Bricolage," Jahan Ramazani reflects on key instances in which postcolonial poets name, rename, and even de-name the signature sites of modernism and relocate the imagination to a "a free-floating noumen," a space that is neither global nor local but somewhere in between. Friedman and Ramazani show how postcolonial writers came to produce a literature that transformed the terms of modernism itself.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>A second narrative of global modernism is evident in the rerouting of modernity through a set of texts that might initially appear to be marginal to its economy. Urmila Seshagiri's essay on Jean Rhys's <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> is exemplary in this regard: Through a careful archeology of the text and its context, she shows how Rhys, coming from the colonial margins, was able to turn modernist experimentation into a medium of cultural transition and in the process to use the resources of modernism to enable a postcolonial aesthetics. A similar reversionary gesture is evident in Jessica Berman's comparative reading of Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist as A Young Man</i> and Mulk Raj Anand's <i>Untouchable</i>. It is often assumed that after his ill-fated adventure in Bloomsbury and under the tutelage of Gandhi, Anand abandoned the project of modernism in favor of a hard driven realism, which, he hoped, would enable him to represent the lives of the Indian poor. But what Berman shows convincingly is that underneath the realism of novels such as <i>Untouchable</i> was a redeployment of the Joycean concept of self-development in the literature of colonial disenchantment; a concept that, for Anand, could be transported to the world of the Indian poor. Anand did not reject Joyce, he just translated his methods to respond to the pressures of late colonialism. In the process, Anand, like the other postcolonial writers discussed in this volume, extended the language and structure of modernism in what might initially appear to be its disavowal. </p>

<p>A final narrative in these essays reopens the old question of the political agency of modernism. We are now so used to thinking about modernism either as an apolitical movement or as the aesthetic ideology of fascism, that we often forget how its practitioners were at the forefront of the international struggle against colonialism and racism in the first half of the twentieth century. As Laura Winkiel notes in her examination of the transnational politics of race in Nancy Cunard's <i>Negro</i>, the ideal of experimentation in modernism could be extended into the field of social relationships. We may debate the motives behind Cunard's public engagement with black writers and artists, but her anthology constitutes a remarkable gathering of the major res in the aesthetic of Pan-Africanism. Cunard turned to modernism and blackness to escape the prison house of Eurocentrism and privilege, but her anthology was the first to give a voice to transnational blackness. The crossing of racial, cultural, and sexual geographies, as Laura Doyle informs us in her comparative study of queer racial subjectivity in the works of Virginia Woolf and Nella Larsen was an invitation to rethink the matrixes that had created the Atlantic world as a space of identity and difference. In both these cases&#x2014;Cunard's anthology and queer subjectivity&#x2014;race provided the logic that simultaneously authorized and deconstructed our ideas of modernism and modernity. In this regard, we can say that modernism, having freed the European subject from the tutelage of tradition, also opened the space in which the other could become a self-reflective subject.

<p class="continued">This Afro-Caribbean poem for a Euromodernist traverses cultural, racial, and gender boundaries via intersections of place names&#x2014;Sligo, Sligoville; mythical heroes&#x2014;Ireland's Cuchulain, Jamaica's ex-slave rebels; and premodern magic&#x2014;Yeats's mysticism, Jamaica's skin-shedding witches and neck-chained, calf-like ghosts. Goodison Irishes Jamaica&#x2014;its hills become "shamrock green"&#x2014;and Jamaicanizes Ireland&#x2014;Cuchulain now has Afro-Caribbean "bush comrades." Apostrophizing a dead poet who often discoursed with the dead, Goodison writes, "William Butler, I swear my dead mother / embraced me. I then washed off my heart / with the amniotic water of a green coconut."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Conjoining myths and magic, topography and words across hemispheres, Goodison res her intercultural relationship with Yeats as 

<b></b>

reciprocal exchange ("We swap duppy stories"): his work has changed hers, and, notwithstanding chronology, her postcolonial reception of his metaleptically transforms it. Poetry, she suggests, is for crossing boundaries between the living and the dead, between times, places, cultures. The space of a poem is neither local&#x2014;a securely anchored signifier of Jamaican authenticity&#x2014;nor global&#x2014;a placeless, free-floating noumenon. It is a translocation, verbally enabling and enacting, between specific times and places, cross-cultural, transhistorical exchange.  </p>

<p>This intercultural conception of poetry is central both to Euromodernism and to what Martinican theorist and writer Edouard Glissant has called the cross-cultural poetics ("<i>po&#x00E9;tique de la Relation</i>") of the Caribbean.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Yet postcolonial criticism has sometimes represented the relation between postcolonialism and Euromodernism as adversarial. Now that the postmodern is no longer seen as an outright rejection of the modern, we also need to reconsider whether and to what extent postcolonial literatures repudiate or "write back to" an imperial Euromodernism. In his pathbreaking analysis of Afro-Caribbean fiction, Simon Gikandi offers a nuanced statement of the agonistic position: "Caribbean modernism is opposed to, though not necessarily independent of, European notions of modernism." Gikandi thus proposes a "Third World modernism distinct from the prototypical European form, which in Houston Baker's words, 'is exclusively Western, preeminently bourgeois, and optically white.'"<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The authors of <i>Toward the Decolonization of African Literature</i> assert a sharper divide: "African literature <i>is </i>an autonomous entity separate and apart from all other literatures. It has its own traditions, models and norms." The influence of Euromodernist "privatism" can only obscure authentic African expression under "dunghill piles of esoterica and obscure allusions."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Bill Ashcroft and John Salter represent modernism's influence beyond the metropole as unambiguously imperialist: "The high-cultural discourse of modernism, with its imposition of a set of largely uncontested parameters upon a non-European cultural reality, may be seen to be metonymic of the operation of imperial domination. Modernity and modernism are rooted in empire."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>But far from being an obstruction that had to be dislodged from the postcolonial windpipe, Euromodernism&#x2014;in one of the great ironies of twentieth-century literary history&#x2014;crucially enabled a range of non-Western poets after World War II to explore their hybrid cultures and postcolonial experience. For these poets, the detour through Euromodernism was often, paradoxically, the surest route home. In his <i>History of the Voice</i>, Kamau Brathwaite offers one of the most vivid testaments to the importance of Euromodernism for the postcolonization of postcolonial literatures. T. S. Eliot, he asserts, was the primary influence on Caribbean poets "moving from standard English" to creolized English, or "nation language": "What T. S. Eliot did for Caribbean poetry and Caribbean literature was to introduce the notion of the speaking voice, the conversational tone. That is what really attracted us to Eliot." Emphasizing the oral/aural medium of transmission and thus assimilating Eliot to West Indian orature, Brathwaite further explains in a footnote: "For those who really made the breakthrough, it was Eliot's actual voice&#x2014;or rather his recorded voice, property of the British Council (Barbados)&#x2014;reading 'Preludes', 'The love song of J. Alfred Prufrock', <i>The Waste Land </i>

<b></b>

and later the <i>Four Quartets</i>&#x2014;not the texts&#x2014;which turned us on. In that dry deadpan delivery, the 'riddims' of St Louis (though we did not know the source then) were stark and clear for those of us who at the same time were listening to the dislocations of Bird, Dizzy and Klook. And it is interesting that, on the whole, the establishment could not stand Eliot's voice&#x2014;and far less jazz!" Brathwaite cites the parallel influence of a BBC cricket commentator's "natural, 'riddimic' and image<i>-</i>laden tropes in his revolutionary Hampshire burr": "he subverted the establishment with the way he spoke and where: like Eliot, like jazz . . .".<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> </p>

<p>Brathwaite hails Eliot for his conversational orality and jazz dislocations, his non-Standard diction and improvisatory rhythms. That a revolutionary afrocentrist could hear the flat British monotone of an Anglo-Catholic Royalist as subversive, could embrace Eliot as an antiestablishment poet for the 1950s and 1960s, might well seem bizarre, especially since for many North American poets of the time, Eliot <i>was</i> the establishment. When Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, and Amiri Baraka turned to jazz as a model for improvisatory rhythms and phrasing, they were repudiating Eliot's academic embodiment in New Critical, formalist norms of coherence, polish, and impersonal wit. In a manifesto for the new American poetries, "Projective Verse" , Charles Olson implicitly mocks "O. M. Eliot" (that is, Order of Merit) for his imperial affinities.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Meanwhile, in Britain, Philip Larkin and other poets of the Movement were also renouncing Eliot and Pound, put off by their polyglossia, syntactic dislocations, and arcane mythologies. But while the Beats, the Black Mountain poets, poets of the Black Arts Movement, as well as poets of the Movement in Britain, saw a stiff-necked modernism&#x2014;aestheticist, elitist, writerly&#x2014;as the dominant mode needing demolition, many leading poets of the "developing world," including the Barbadian Brathwaite, Saint Lucian Walcott, Indian A. K. Ramanujan, Ugandan Okot p'Bitek, and the Nigerians Christopher Okigbo and Wole Soyinka, seized on Euromodernism as a tool of liberation. These postcolonial poets, all born in a five year span from 1929 to 1934 and thus initially educated under British colonial rule, came of age during the formal breakup of much of the British Empire from the late 1940s through the 1960s. They leveraged Euromodernism against British Romantic, Victorian, and other imperial norms calcified in their local educational and cultural establishments&#x2014;norms that resulted in the stilted, neo-Romantic poems enshrined by organizations such as the Jamaican Poetry League.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For the young Brathwaite, Eliot's impersonality and unpredictability seemed an emancipatory alternative to the closed, emotive, monologic voice of the canonical English lyric purveyed in the schools. For Ramanujan, modernist astringency served as an antidote to the mawkishness and monologism of much postwar Indian poetry in English. Though often seen as a nativist, Okot p'Bitek employed brisk, modernist free verse and defamiliarizingly literal translation to satirize the hypocrisy and pomposity of African missionaries and politicians. Against the restrictive "platform poetry" of negritude, Okigbo and Soyinka unleashed an intercultural polyphony they derived in part from modernism. The opening lyric of Walcott's <i>Collected Poems </i>redeploys the agonized self-divisions of "Prufrock," with auxiliary echoes of <i>The Waste Land</i>: "I go, 

<b></b>

of course, through all the isolated acts, / Make a holiday of situations, / Straighten my tie and fix important jaws. . . ." The modernist topos of self-alienation, far from being "metonymic of the operation of imperial domination," serves to contest the imperialist image of West Indians found "In tourist booklets, behind ardent binoculars; / Found in the blue reflection of eyes / That have known cities and think us here happy."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> The choice for Walcott, Brathwaite, Ramanujan, Okot, Okigbo, and Soyinka was not between an imported Euromodernism and a pristine native culture, since the forms of cultural dominance against which they struggled were often local instantiations of the imperium&#x2014;Victorian sentiment and monologue, missionary prudishness and hypocrisy, colonial education and racism, a tourist industry complicit in the production of imprisoning stereotypes, and nationalisms and nativisms that mirrored European norms in reverse. To insist, in the name of anti-Eurocentricity, that Euromodernism be seen as an imperial antagonist is to condescend to imaginative writers who have wielded modernism in cultural decolonization and, ironically, to impose as universal a Eurocentric standard: the antimodernism of postwar American and British poetry.  </p>

<p>The intercultural poetic forms of modernism, in particular, have been especially attractive to so-called Third World poets in their quest to break through monologic lyricism, to express their cross-cultural experience, despite vast differences in ethnicity, geography, politics, and history from the Euromodernists. Modernist bricolage&#x2014;the synthetic use in early twentieth-century poetry of diverse cultural materials ready to hand&#x2014;has helped postcolonial poets encode aesthetically the intersections among multiple cultural vectors. Writing in the metropole at a time of imperial and ethnographic adventure, massive immigration, world war, interlingual mixture, and accelerated communication and travel, the Euromodernists&#x2014;many of them exiles and &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9;s themselves&#x2014;were the first English-language poets to create a formal vocabulary for the intercultural collisions and juxtapositions, the epistemic instabilities and decenterings, of globalization.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  By contrast with the disjunctiveness and perspectivism of the modernist poem, the premodern English lyric was, Brathwaite suggests, a model that risked suppressing the cultural complexity of postcolonial experience, because it could not adequately articulate such intercultural discordance as being schooled to write poems about unseen snowfall while living in the hurricane-swept tropics.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  For many postcolonial poets, though on the receiving end of empire, more important than the modernists' complicity in a waning imperialism and in Orientalist fantasy, or their imbrication in European literary tradition, was their creation of answering forms and vocabularies for the cross-cultural juxtapositions, interreligious layerings, and polyglot interminglings of cross-hemispheric experience. </p>

<p>But while postcolonial poets emergent in the 1950s and 1960s weren't antimodernists, neither were they Euromodernist wannabes. If postcolonial criticism has often been too eager to depict postcolonial writers as revolutionary Calibans struggling heroically against hegemonic, Euromodernist Prosperos, modernist criticism has at times been perhaps too eager to assimilate postcolonialism to Euromodernism as "part of the same movement."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Yet the contrasts should not be bleached out, since Euromodernists, even if marginal to the British cultural and political center by virtue of nationality (e.g., 

<b></b>

Irish or American), class, sexual orientation, or aesthetics ("<i>&#x00E9;pater les bourgeois</i>" avant-gardism), were finally less marginal than non-European poets growing up in Castries, Bridgetown, Kingston, Mysore, Srinagar, Ojoto, Ibadan, or Gulu. Postcolonial hybridity and modernist bricolage are thus, in James Clifford's phrase, "<i>discrepant cosmopolitanisms</i>."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The conditions of possibility for postcolonial hybridity are violent occupation and cultural imposition at home, across immense differences of power, topography, culture, and economics. Its non-West is primary and profoundly experiential, not the object of extraterritorial questing via tourism and museums, books and ethnography, friendships and translations. By contrast, Euromodernists make use, as L&#x00E9;vi-Strauss says of the bricoleur, of a limited heterogeneity, their materials often made available by imperial and ethnographic forays.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Even the most boldly cross-hemispheric Euromodernist poets occasionally import a subaltern text or artifact or genre and embed it within a Western literary universe. Since the postcolonial writer inhabits the multiple cultural worlds forcibly conjoined by empire, hybridity&#x2014;the knotting together of countless already knotted together indigenous and imposed languages, images, and genres&#x2014;is not an aspect but the basic fabric of the postcolonial poem. In redeploying modernism across these differences, postcolonial poets have had to refashion it for resisting local and imperial monisms, for articulating a cross-culturalism still more plural and polyphonic than Euromodernism. They have reshaped it through indigenous genres and vocabularies, have recentered it in non-Western landscapes and mythologies, and have often inverted its racial and cultural politics. </p>

<p>Among the hybridizing literary strategies of postcolonial poetry that can be traced in part to Euromodernist bricolage are translocalism, mythical syncretism, heteroglossia, and apocalypticism. Translocalism, the mode of intercultural syncretism with which I began, is key to A. K. Ramanujan's "Chicago Zen": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Watch your step. Sight may strike<br /> you blind in unexpected places.</p>

<p>
The traffic light turns orange 

<br />on 57th and Dorchester, and you stumble,</p>

<b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">

In this morphing of Lake Michigan into a South Asian river, of the traffic light by Hyde Park into Indian forest fires, Ramanujan adapts the modernist technique of translocal "super-position," as Pound called it&#x2014;Eliot's layering of the Thames and the Ganges, Pound's of a mountain near the DTC in Pisa and Mount Taishan. He renews both Euromodernist technique and its indigenous counterpart, fusing superposition to what he termed the "montage" and "dissolve" effects of Dravidian poetry, as well as the startling paradoxes of Zen.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  As in Goodison's melding of Ireland's Sligo and Jamaica's Sligoville, Walcott's of the Greek islands and the Antilles, distances between North and South collapse: "you drown," Ramanujan writes in an echo of "Prufrock," "eyes open, // towards the Indies, the antipodes." Not that postcolonial and modernist translocalisms are identical. The Euromodernist superpositional poem imports into an experiential Western place (the Thames, Pisa) an "other," exoticized, Eastern place (the Ganges, Mount Taishan), whereas in "Chicago Zen," the speaker "falls" from one floor of his migrant experience&#x2014;Chicago&#x2014;to another&#x2014;India, two worlds that he has lived in and that now live in him. And whereas the Euromodernist poem often de-realizes the local (Eliot's London, Pound's Pisa) by silhouetting it against an Eastern alterity, Ramanujan's poem revises this modernist strategy by oscillating between fully real but discrepant locations. Ramanujan assimilates modernist translocalism to what Salman Rushdie calls the "migrant's-eye view of the world"&#x2014;born of a more fully interstitial migrancy than that of the modernists, because of its layering upon a prior postcolonial dislocation, and thus a more thoroughgoing "experience of uprooting, disjuncture and metamorphosis (slow or rapid, painful or pleasurable)."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> </p>

<p>Postcolonial poets have also adapted mythical syncretism from the modernists as a key device for their intercultural poetics: like Cuchulain, so Goodison's maroon warrior; like Shango&#x2014;Yoruba god of lightning&#x2014;so electricity in Soyinka's "Idanre." The modernists helped make the high art poem a space for the cross-religious syncretism that was basic to life in the colonies and postcolonies, so that, once again, an imported modernism paradoxically serves as a means for transmuting into literary discourse "postcolocal" experience, to propose a portmanteau word that, combining "postcolonial" with "local," also highlights the translocalism&#x2014;"colocal"&#x2014;of the postcolonial. Having in modernist fashion developed his "own personal religion," out of Christian, classical, and Igbo sources, Christopher Okigbo said in an interview "The way that I worship my gods is in fact through poetry."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Yeats also thought of poetry as a syncretic rite, and Okigbo delivers an appropriately ritualistic homage to Yeats as "the arch-priest of the sanctuary" in his "Lament of the Masks," published by the University of Ibadan in a book celebrating Yeats's centenary in 1965.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In this late poem, which has been described as marking Okigbo's shift to a more African aesthetic, Okigbo paradoxically africanizes his poetry in the act of praising a Euromodernist.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Indigenization and aesthetic modernization, for Okigbo as for Ramanujan, are not polar opposites but closely linked. Direct references within the poem to classical panegyric and to praise song indicate Okigbo's remaking of European genres within an African framework (the contributor's note also states the poem "is based on a traditional Yoruba praise-song").<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Drawing on the traditional praise song's ritualistic imagery of the hunt, animals, and 

<b></b>

heroic action, Okigbo arrays an African elephant, jungle, plaintain leaf, and giant iroko tree alongside symbols adapted from the temple of Yeats's poetry&#x2014;iron-throated singers in bird-masks&#x2014;and from classical myth&#x2014;"Waggoner of the great Dawn" ("LM,"xiii). He reterritorializes Yeats, africanizing him as an elephant hunter, his masks as ritual objects, while deterritorializing the praise song, centering it on a European subject. It is hard not to hear a wry pun on "canon" in Okigbo's modest self-representation: </p>

<p class="continued">Having spent much time in an "ethereal ivory tower," Yeats comes across as a perhaps too idealistic&#x2014;if tireless and heroic&#x2014;chaser of "the white elephant." Still, on balance, the relation of Okigbo's poem to Yeats's verse is more affiliative than corrosive: like Goodison, Okigbo credits Yeats with having helped to translate lived, "postcolocal," trans-religious feeling into poetry. Elsewhere, Okigbo's poetry of polymythic syncretism draws extensively on the intercultural amalgamations of Pound's poetry&#x2014;from <i>The Cantos </i>he even adapts archaisms, shifting cadences, and the refrain, especially resonant in 1960s Nigeria, "&amp; the mortar is not yet dry."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Okigbo remarked that he "never felt" a "conflict" between his European and his African cultural inheritances, and his praise song for Yeats synthesizes mythologies of Euroclassical ("rumour awakens"), Christian ("Water of baptism"), and precolonial African ("Thunder above the earth") origin ("LM,"xii, xiv).  </p>

<p>Although Walcott sometimes highlights the tensions among the various points on his religious and cultural compass (for example, the early "A Far Cry from Africa"), he, too, is often an organic syncretist, to draw on Bakhtin's distinction between "organic" and "intentional" modes of hybridity.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In an especially high-spirited scene of <i>Omeros</i> that humorously pumps up modernist comparativism, Walcott imagines a cyclone pounding Saint Lucia as a raucous party to which he invites European, African, and Caribbean gods. They play Yoruba and Afro-Caribbean "Shango drums" that "made Neptune rock in the caves," while the Haitian love goddess Erzulie rattles "her ra-ra," the Afro-Caribbean snake god Damballa winds, and the Yoruba and Afro-Caribbean blacksmith Ogun fires drinks with "his partner Zeus."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Unlike Okigbo or Soyinka, Walcott aestheticizes the transreligious, displaying his intercultural groupings as artifacts. Still, his compression of deities from diverse pantheons into one polyphonous space energizes both party and poem. Like Okigbo's, the later Walcott's syncretism 

<b></b>

tends to be more exuberant than elegiac&#x2014;a celebration of transregional inheritance in the Caribbean&#x2014;unlike Eliot's "mythical method," where the parallels often encode a narrative of degeneration, a Eurocentric lament over decline and dissipation.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  </p>

<p>More nearly affiliated with Eliot's elegiac syncretism, if still distinct, is the work of a poet of the next generation, the Kashmiri American Agha Shahid Ali. In "Ghazal" ("Where are you now? Who lies beneath your spell tonight"), the different faiths of Ali's youth jostle alongside one another, in references to Biblical stories, a Hindu temple, and a Shi'a God.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Repulsed by violence in the name of religion&#x2014;executions, smashed statues and idols&#x2014; "A refugee from Belief seeks a cell tonight," perhaps in the discontinuous two-line cells of the ghazal itself:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">In the echo chamber of this final couplet, Ali commingles Job ("only am escaped [alone] to tell thee"), <i>Moby-Dick </i>("Call me Ishmael" and the Job quotation), and Islamic tradition (Ishmael as ur-ancestor). In this further example of what I term the dialectics of indigenization, Ali reinvigorates both the "native" and the foreign, both the Urdu-Arabic-Persian form of the ghazal and the Euromodernist mode of mythical syncretism, bracing them together through their homologous conjunctures and fissures. Hardly a disabling imperial influence, modernist syncretism, ghazalified, functions for Ali as a counterweight to tyrannies closer to "home"&#x2014;the religious and nationalist absolutisms that have ravaged Kashmir. As required by the ghazal, the poet names himself (the <i>takhallos</i>), but he then gives himself another name, Ishmael&#x2014;an intercultural node in which Judaism, Christianity, and Islam intersect, as they have in the poem's formal junctures and syncretic layerings. This <i>takhallos</i> may also recall the strange fusion of self-reference and scattershot quotation in a famous retrospective coda&#x2014;"These fragments I have shored against my ruins"&#x2014;particularly in view of Ali's discussion, in his dissertation-turned-monograph, <i>T. S. Eliot as Editor</i>, of the "sense 

<b></b>

of loss and desolation" in <i>The Waste Land.</i><sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Lamenting exile, linguistic displacement, and political violence in his poems, Ali is drawn to Eliot's work by its resemblance to the melancholy of Urdu poetry, to the disjunctive collage and impersonal personality of the ghazal. Yet whereas Eliot grieves in the gaps between one version of a myth and its successors, in the instabilities and ruptures of cultural multiplicity, Ali freely moves among intimately felt inheritances from English, American, and Urdu literatures and from Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, mobilizing these against both public and private losses, and against monistic structures of recuperation from such losses. The differential appropriations of Eliot by a poet of Shi'a Muslim and of Afro-Caribbean origin&#x2014;that is the differences between Ali's Eliot and Brathwaite's satiric, jazzy, creolized Eliot&#x2014;again instance the diverse postcolonial indigenizations of modernism. For Ali, as for Brathwaite, Goodison, Okigbo, and Ramanujan, modernism represents not an "imposition of a set of largely uncontested parameters upon a non-European cultural reality," but a multifaceted and mutable resource, amenable to different localizing strategies and syntheses. </p>

<p>Modernist heteroglossia&#x2014;rapid turns from high to low, Standard to dialect, English to Sanskrit or Chinese, preeminently in Eliot and Pound&#x2014;is another form of literary bricolage submitted to the dialectics of indigenization by postcolonial poets, especially in the Caribbean. Whereas Eliot and Pound, as Michael North has shown, made ambivalent use of African American vernacular as vital yet debased, Brathwaite, Walcott, and Goodison have adopted heteroglossia as a poetic structure to re the code switching of Barbados, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia&#x2014;an everyday practice that was, nevertheless, largely absent from earlier West Indian poems, which were usually written in Creole, Standard English, or a comic medley of the two.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Although Brathwaite hears a hint of nation language in a voice recording of Claude McKay's Standard English poetry, he suggests that the English lyric had rendered largely inaudible the poet's Afro-Euro-American creolization.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  In "Calypso," a signature poem of Brathwaite's <i>Rights of Passage</i>, the first part of <i>The Arrivants</i>, his echo of <i>The Waste Land</i> makes clear the literary template for his criss-crossing voices: Black Sam "carries bucketfuls of water / 'cause his Ma's just had another daughter" (the moonlight shines on Eliot's "Mrs. Porter / And on her daughter / They wash their feet in soda water").<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Like Eliot, whose irregularly placed rhymes and shifting rhythms he redeploys, Brathwaite plays various Englishes against one another: in "Calypso," a prophetic voice intoning a creation myth of the Caribbean ("curved stone hissed into reef / wave teeth fanged into clay"); a satiric ode on white plantation life, built on Eliot's "so elegant / So intelligent" Shakespeherian rag ("O it was a wonderful time / an elegant benevolent redolent time&#x2014;"); calypso itself ("Steel drum steel drum / hit the hot calypso dancing"); and West Indian Creole ("please to take 'im back"). Brathwaite's early heteroglossia, like Eliot's, exemplifies Bakhtin's "intentional hybridity," a poetry of satiric tensions and incongruities among voices, languages, sociolects. By the time Walcott is publishing "The Schooner <i>Flight</i>" in 1977&#x2013;1979 and Lorna Goodison her first volumes of poetry in the 1980s, they, Brathwaite, and other West Indian poets are more nimbly and pervasively switching between Standard and dialectal codes, even as they have altered, abandoned, or inverted the linguistic hierarchies of modernism.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Modernist apocalypses have also served poets from different parts of the postcolonial world, and the apocalyptic is intimately tied to the intercultural in <i>The Waste Land </i>and other modernist poems, the crossing from West to East affording an extrinsic vantage point that reveals or uncovers (<i>apokalypsis</i>) the crisis of modernity. Indeed, the apocalyptic mode evinces the intense ambivalence toward modernity in both Euromodernist and postcolonial writing. At the end of "The Fire Sermon," inveighing against the West's unhinging of sex from religion, Eliot fuses the Buddha and Augustine&#x2014;"Burning burning burning burning"&#x2014;in what his note names "this collocation of these two representatives of eastern and western asceticism."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In "Irae," Brathwaite reroutes Eliot's moral apocalypse into a postcolonial confrontation with the West, intoning "burning burning from tomorrow" in an early version of the poem.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> In this instance of the dialectics of indigenization, of the transformative twinning of the Euromodernist with the postcolocal, Brathwaite fuses Eliotic and Rastafarian apocalypses, as he earlier had in the vision of Babylon burned in "Wings of a Dove." Aggressively dislocating "Dies Irae" to address contemporary circumstance&#x2014;a dislocation that also recalls Eliot's violent decontextualization of traditional material to simulate crisis&#x2014;Brathwaite pounds out a prophecy of doom in the insistent rhymes and rhythms of the thirteenth-century hymn: "dies irae dreadful day / when the world shall pass away." In two of the tercets' middle lines, he chillingly compacts the names of massacres&#x2014;"mi lai sharpville wounded knee"&#x2014;and weapons&#x2014;"poniard poison rocket bomb"&#x2014;that occasion the poem's distress and rage. The poet sees divine retribution in the violent resistance of Jamaica's Maroon leaders&#x2014;"nanny cuffee cudjoe." Brathwaite thus remakes Eliot's fiery apocalypse to condemn an imperial West that&#x2014;technologically superior but ethically insane&#x2014;is responsible for unspeakable injustices and atrocities and thus deserves its imminent implosion:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>day of fire dreadful day <br />
day for which all sufferers pray <br />
grant me patience with thy plenty <br />
grant me vengeance with thy sword <sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The political implications of Brathwaite's poem could hardly be more different from those we usually associate with Eliot's. Even so, in translating Eliot's apocalypse across the North/South divide and melding it, via a medieval hymn, with Rastafarian chant, Brathwaite renews the apocalyptic mode: like the Euromodernists, he uses religious language for a compressed, visionary evocation of modernity as cataclysmic violence, a modern history trembling on the verge of dramatic and perhaps ultimate transformation.  </p>

<p>Another poem of cosmic symbolism, including the thunder and lightning mythologized in West Africa, Christopher Okigbo's "Come Thunder" also adapts modernist apocalypticism&#x2014;especially Yeats's&#x2014;to bespeak a liminal moment in "Third World" history, the first of numerous civil wars that have ravaged postcolonial Africa. Okigbo presents as a second coming, complete with birds that seem almost Byzantine, the events leading up to the Nigerian civil war, in which he was to t and die:

<p class="continued">As in Yeats's prophecies, the violence of modernity inspires a troubled joy&#x2014;"laughter, broken in two, hangs tremulous between the teeth"&#x2014;and a joyous terror&#x2014;the threat of an unknowable, iron-masked future. Okigbo, again like Yeats, lexically achieves the apocalyptic by combining the concrete ("The smell of blood," "myriad eyes of deserted corn cobs") with the indefinite ("immeasurable," "unnamed," "unprintable"). He africanizes the affective and formal structures of the modernist apocalypse&#x2014;his title evoking also "What the Thunder Said"&#x2014;for a postcolonial vision of a rough beast about to be born. Since modernist apocalypses are thought to represent a Eurocentric response to the decline of a Western imperium, such adaptability may well seem surprising, but British poets of the 1930s, as Stephen Spender indicates, already believed that, "Considered as an apocalyptic vision, the Communist view coincides with that of T. S. Eliot in <i>The Waste Land </i>or Yeats in <i>The Second Coming.</i>"<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Postcolonial poets have been no less ready to remake Euromodernist apocalypses for their ambivalent visions of the historical rupture of modernity. </p>

<p>Having explored how "Third World" poets postcolonize Euromodernism and Euromodernize the postcolonial, I reverse the lens, reconsidering the cross-cultural bricolage of a few of the most canonical modernist poems, in view of this postcolonial reception. As I have already suggested, the North/South syncretism and trans-hemispheric interstitiality in Euromodernist poems differ from the often more thoroughly hybridized language, mythology, genres, and geography of postcolonial texts. The primary trans-hemispheric current in Euromodernist poems is the importation of East and South Asian materials. These poems invoke Asian religious texts, such as the Upanishads and the Fire Sermon, as well as literary genres or visual artifacts, such as haiku or a lapis lazuli carving, as potential solutions to Eurocentric crises of faith, war, literature, and tradition. They often exotically construct the East as spiritual Other, as site of ancient wisdom, frozen in an archaic state, voided of a contemporary history with real human beings.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  In keeping with other familiar patterns of circulation and long-lived Orientalist assumptions, the literary West, as site of artistic and epistemic production, mines and arrogates to itself raw materials imported from Asia and makes of them new elite forms of literary capital. </p>

<p>If so, how could Eliot, Yeats, and Pound furnish enabling examples for postcolonial poets? Are not the Euromodernists, as Neil Lazarus writes of such Western musicians 

<b></b>

as Paul Simon, guilty of a "profound insensitivity to the politico-ethical implications of cultural appropriation across the international division of labor," of a "distressing unilateralism of influence," a "complete lack of cultural dialogism"?<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  In an essay on <i>The Waste Land </i>and empire, Paul Douglass has argued that Pound and Eliot's "aesthetics of the jagged and the juxtaposed," the "fragmentary and syncretic," is inherently "reactionary," part of a larger project in "defense of . . . empire": such literary wreckage demands the imperial, reconstructive labor of a learned elite.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  More generally, these modernist texts are increasingly thought to belong seamlessly to the Orientalist project of fabricating, managing, and disciplining the East. But the postcolonial poetic response compels us to ask whether such views are fully adequate to the cross-cultural dimension of Euromodernist poetry, whether the manner of its assimilation of non-Western texts and artifacts&#x2014;often inorganic, incomplete, and self-conscious&#x2014;might enable these to interact dialogically with the predominantly Western texts into which they are imported. </p>

<p>In my view, because of <i>The Waste Land</i>'s and <i>The Cantos</i>' heteroglot representation of the East partly in its languages, these indigenous texts retain at least some capacity to question both their Western host texts and the ways in which the non-West is represented. In an essay on the uses of India in <i>The Waste Land</i>, Harish Trivedi argues that "for Eliot, there aren't in this poem, there never were and never would be, any solutions outside Christianity. Here, near the climax of his poem ["What the Thunder Said"], he takes up, in order to interrogate, the traditional claim of Eastern spiritual efficacy, and finds it wanting."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  But in Eliot's collage of his own poetry with the text of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the discordance between the ethical injunctions<i> Datta, Dayadhvam, Damyata </i>and the English responses shows up not the East's but the West's spiritual inefficacy, its helplessness to redress its crisis. The Sanskrit texts&#x2014;though perhaps framed like objects in the British Museum&#x2014;nevertheless write back to an empire that in the early 1920s continued to assert its superiority and mastery over these texts' site of origin. By way of an imperfect analogy, imagine if during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, John Ashbery or Jorie Graham embedded Koranic verses in their poetry as signifiers of spiritual wisdom. "Shantih     shantih     shantih," normally the closing benediction of an Upanishad, suggestively reframes <i>The Waste Land</i>, as if to say, this poem aspires to the peacefulness of an ancient, sacred, meditative text from still-colonized India, but, as perhaps indicated by Eliot's omission of the standard prefix "Om," again shows the West to fall short. Ultimately, even the poem's critique of the West, though offered in the voice of the other, can be seen as problematically appropriative, since Eliot is using Eastern materials to Western ends&#x2014;Eastern supplements that are, finally, appendages to a fundamentally Western project. But we should be wary of the na&#x00EF;ve presupposition that a poetic text could, as if released from all ethnocentric moorings, engage a text from another hemisphere without assimilative pressure, without using it for its own cultural ends. Moreover, the poem's shadowing of a non-Western religion with a Christian intertext&#x2014;Trivedi cites the translation of the poem's last line as the biblical "Peace which passeth understanding"&#x2014;is common to some of the most celebrated postcolonial works (Achebe reshapes Igbo stories to fit 

<b></b>

Christian paradigms in <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, and Okigbo returns in <i>Heavensgate </i>to Igbo myth and culture through the story of the prodigal son).<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  While Christian yearning plays a part in <i>The Waste Land</i>, to read back into the poem the logic of the salvific Christianity Eliot later embraced is to allow this telos to evacuate the melancholic specificity, the painful splaying across hemispheres, of this literary moment. We do violence to its intercultural dialogism and disjuncture, its textual "fragments" and personal "ruins," if we overemphasize the recuperative clause wedged between these two substantives&#x2014;"I have shored against." <i>The Waste Land</i>, while not escaping the Orientalism of modern Western representations of the East, also sets Eastern and Western texts in dialogic relation with one another, and in this double-voicedness, in the seams between the pieces of the trans-hemispheric collage, in the cross-cultural slippage between text and embedded text, the Eastern quotations retain at least some capacity to make themselves heard. </p>

<p>Yeats's "Lapis Lazuli" also both participates in and questions Orientalist assimilation, exoticism, and supplementarity. Like <i>The Waste Land</i>, the poem enacts a psycho-geographical movement from a Western panorama of destruction to an Eastern alterity. Here again, the onset of large-scale terror and destruction occasions the poet's cross-cultural excursion to the Orient, where Yeats stages the last in a series of rejoinders to the view that artistic gaiety is frivolous in wartime&#x2014;fiddling while the metropole burns. Edmund Dulac had written Yeats that he feared London would be bombed, and in 1936, Hitler, Mussolini, and Spanish generals were indeed mobilizing for war. The eighteenth-century Chinese carving, arrived at in the poem after a typically modernist leap across hemispheres, seems at first to offer an exotic refuge:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Two Chinamen, behind them a third, <br />
Are carved in Lapis Lazuli, <br />
Over them flies a long-legged bird <br />
A symbol of longevity; <br />
The third, doubtless a serving-man, <br />
Carries a musical instrument.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">After the scenes of death and ruin in the earlier stanzas, the calm enumeration of hierarchical social roles, twinned with signifiers of hermeneutic certainty (the bird "A symbol of longevity"), suggests a timeless, Oriental world of order, harmony, and stability. But in the ensuing lines, East/West binaries begin to collapse, as time and ruin invade the scene: "Every discolouration of the stone, / Every accidental crack or dent. . ." (ibid.). If the poet has tried to displace Western war and chaos with an atemporal, Eastern security, the carving's surface fissures this Orientalist presumption. Although Yeats's poem is not, like Eliot's, heteroglot, his modernist close reading of the artifact enables its surface to assert a reality that contravenes the Orientalist abstractions with which he began: the poem self-correctively pivots, undoing its reified image of the Chinese stone. Here, as in Eliot's poem, this slippage, though limited, creates a space for a counterdiscourse to be heard: the East is not the timeless haven the poet hoped for.  </p>

<p>But no sooner has Yeats established the stone's fractured surface as primary than he begins to project onto it his poetic fantasies, troping each mark as 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>. . . a water-course or an avalanche, <br />
Or lofty slope where it still snows <br />
Though doubtless plum or cherry-branch <br />
Sweetens the little half-way house <br />
Those Chinamen climb towards, and I <br />
Delight to imagine them seated there. . . . [ibid.]</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">His poetic self-consciousness foregrounded by the second use of "doubtless" and the enjambment that suspends the lyric "I" at the end of a line, the poet shows us a Western mind at the moment of its interplay with an Eastern artifact, of inspiration by and transformation of Chinese art into something other than itself. Although these lines belong to the discourse, in Edward Said's words, "by which European culture was able to manage&#x2014;and even produce&#x2014;the Orient," they also open a reflective space within that discourse, because they thematize the literary work of producing the Orient.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Instancing the imaginative joy of building again out of things that fall, the poet indulges Orientalist fantasy, writing over the stone's surface with stock plum- or cherry-branches and an imagined trek half way up the mountain. Yet set off by the stone's corrective, his construction of a self-affirming Western lyric moment out of the fissures and interstices of an Eastern artwork is shown to supplement, twist, and distort. While the poem assimilates the Chinese Other to Nietzschean tragic joy, and while the poet is returned to himself through the wrinkle-eyed gaze of the other, this assimilation also impedes itself; after all, the poet needs the other to remain at least somewhat other, if only so that he can use the Orient as an alternative space from which to look back critically at the anguish and terror gripping the contemporary Occident. That he imagines the Chinamen climbing not to a transcendental site atop the mountain but to a halfway house res their in-betweenness as part-Chinamen, part-ents of a Western imagination. Indeed, in a letter about the carving, Yeats similarly interrupts himself, unable to decide whether to write about the East as Other or as assimilable to Western tragedy: "The heroic cry in the midst of despair. But no, I am wrong, the east has its solutions always and therefore knows nothing of tragedy."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Self-interrupting, self-thematizing, the poem foregrounds what we might call the Orientalist wobble, caught as it is between assimilation and acknowledgment, between exoticism and historicity. </p>

<p>Another key poem in the Euromodernist canon, Pound's "In a Station of the Metro" also crosses from West to East, but dramatically miniaturizes the journey: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>The apparition of these faces in the crowd; <br />
Petals on a wet, black bough.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The poem's imaginative leap&#x2014;often celebrated for its modernist compression and ellipsis&#x2014;is again transhemispheric, from an urban Western scene, specifically located by the title in a Parisian Metro station, to an unmistakably East Asian, painterly image of flower petals against a branch. In his well-known account of composing the poem, Pound writes of "trying to record the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself, or darts into a thing inward and subjective."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  His implicit association

 of the East with the "inward and subjective," as contrasted with the historicized, materialized objectivity of the urban crowd scene, accords with the Orientalist abstraction of the East as spiritual and immaterial that we also saw in <i>The Waste Land </i>and in "Lapis Lazuli." Also like Eliot and Yeats, Pound turns to Asia in a moment of crisis or, in his own word, "impasse," seizing on Japanese haiku as a literary model that enables his breakthrough&#x2014;a mirror-image of the later postcolonial importation of Euromodernism to shatter the impasse of a colonial poetics. Pound famously recounts how he reduced the poem from thirty lines to two under the influence of the compression and "super-position" of haiku, suggesting that an Asian literary structure helped engender the starkly juxtapositional poetics of modernism and, insofar as this is an intercultural formation, again complicating the view that such jaggedness is inherently imperialist.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  With its title seen as integral, the poem is still more closely linked to the three-line structure of haiku (short to long to short line).<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Pound's prototypically Imagist poem thus encrypts and enacts within its split, trans-hemispheric textual body a miniaturized psycho-biographical narrative of its genesis out of a cross-cultural imaginative passage from West to East. By at once internalizing and displaying the logic of its East-West dislocation, by refusing connectives that would discursively paper over the gap between the Western urban scene and Eastern ideality, by formally alluding to the three-line haiku without flattening its differences from this generic paradigm, the poem represents an Orientalism that is also anti-Orientalist, that is cross-cutting and counterdiscursive. Pound's later free translations of <i>Cathay </i>will&#x2014;through the use of Japanese for Chinese names of places and poets&#x2014;also foreground a densely mediated reception history that similarly impedes, even as other features of the texts advance, Orientalist transparency and penetration. </p>

<p>In sum, these three poems exemplify Orientalist appropriation, exoticism, and misreading, but the intercultural crossings they enact are also self-divided, self-impeding, and self-critical. While inserting a non-Western text, artifact, image, or genre into an Orientalist discourse, they also make audible the friction between re and frame, foreground the wobble of assimilation or alterity. Monologic imperialism is thus inadequate as a description of their intercultural work&#x2014;their jagged cross-cultural juxtapositions, their dialogic counterpointing of here and there, their leveraging of the East in their critique of the West, ultimately their openness, if only partial, to the potentially transformative impact of the voice of the other. </p>

<p>A later generation of poets on the margins of empire can thus help us reconsider what we think we know about modernist poetry. Not that the modernists in their own time are identical with their subsequent reception. The postcolonial uncovering of generative potentiality in modernism does not literally change the historical reality of the poets' words or actions. By the same token, Pound's profound influence on the second-generation Jewish modernists&#x2014;the Objectivists Reznikoff, Zukofsky, and Oppen&#x2014;does not make some of his poetry any less virulently anti-Semitic. Nevertheless, that later poets have been able to read the poetry of Eliot, Yeats, and Pound against the grain of its limitations should indeed shape our understanding of the potential of Euromodernist aesthetics. Eliot's uses of Donne's forced, cerebral conjunctions; Yeats's

transmutation of Shelley's and Blake's visionary poetics; Langston Hughes's and Sterling Brown's adaptations of Whitman's omnivorous personae&#x2014;in such cases, the transumption releases and revitalizes aspects of a precursor's work. "The words of a dead man," in Auden's aphorism, "Are modified in the guts of the living."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  The Language poets, as Marjorie Perloff has argued, take up and expand certain features of modernist poetry that make us see it anew&#x2014;constructivism, anti-absorptive artifice, the poetics of adjacency and surface fragmentation.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  This modernism is by and large the reverse of the witty, paradoxical, ironic modernism that the mid-century American formalists&#x2014;the early Robert Lowell and Richard Wilbur&#x2014;made the foundation of their poetry. In what we might term the postcolonial metaleptic, modernism's relation to postcolonial poetry illuminates yet other features&#x2014;translocalism, polymythic syncretism, heteroglossia, ambivalent modernity, apocalypticism, interstitial migrancy, cultural self-alienation and self-critique and dialogism&#x2014;that otherwise might risk being obscured. </p>

<p>Literary modernism is often praised or blamed for its cross-cultural appropriations, with scant awareness of its postcolonial afterlives&#x2014;Goodison's swapping duppy stories with Yeats, Brathwaite's hearing his own Creole rhythms in Eliot's poetry, Okigbo's africanizing of Yeats's masks and of Pound's cross-religious syncretism, Ali's use of modernist disjunctiveness and melancholy to translate the ghazal. But these afterlives are vital in reconceptualizing the cross-cultural forms and languages of modernism, while dialectically yielding new insight into the still more vividly cross-cultural poetries beyond the Euro-American metropole. In an important essay, Ramanujan cites Eliot's famous description of European texts as forming " 'a simultaneous order,' where every new text within a series confirms yet alters the whole order ever so slightly, and not always so slightly."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Indigenizing and pluralizing Eliot's theory of literary tradition, he argues that Indian texts reflect and refract, invert and subvert one another, that in India "a whole tradition may invert, negate, rework, and revalue another." The same holds for the relation of his own and other postcolonial poets' work to Euromodernism: postcolonial hybridity "confirms yet alters," reworks yet revalues modernist bricolage. It thus re-begets a poetic mode that helped beget it. Only by breaking out of exclusionary models of tradition as either Eliot's "mind of Europe" or its postcolonial obverse ("an autonomous entity separate and apart from all other literatures") can we begin to grasp the continuous remaking of "traditions" by one another across the twentieth century and beyond, the mutually transformative relations between the poetries of metropole and margin. </p>

<p id="lead">This collection bears witness to the role of the nation-state as the crucible for modernism and modernity emerging from the late-nineteenth into the twentieth century. The essays bring alive the emotional resonance of nationalism for hierarchically racialized and sexualized subjects at (neo)colonial centers and margins. Indeed, in the last turn-of-the-century's battle of modernities, the nation-state was the universal model under dispute among socialist, anarchist, and capitalist philosophies for colonial as well as anticolonial subjecthood, as it is at this turn into the twenty-first century. In this context, anti/post-colonial literature aspires to be or becomes national literature even as it problematizes the concept of nation. Until as recently as 2002, the issue of nation-state identity in modernist literary studies had been rendered in one of two ways: either largely implicit or absent from discussions of Anglo-American and Western European authors, or the only focus in overdetermined approaches to Latin American, Asian or African authors. Since 2003, however, as  itself evinces, more essays inquire into various nationalisms&#x2014;Black, Jewish, Irish, Yugoslav, mestizo Latin American, Scottish, Italian&#x2014;all premised on nation-state identities. This material environment for what Simon Gikandi describes in the preface as the production of "linguistic gestures" thus situates "modernist" and "postcolonial" not only in terms of literary genres but also in their common basis in modernities of conflicting conrations.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> While modernists often used the term "international" to project their own image of the world, this special issue's focus on "transnationalisms" strives to reflect "ours."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 

<b></b>

Both terms&#x2014;"international" and "transnational"&#x2014;spur their/our desires to juxtapose, if not inevitably to compare, ideas and identities in and across spaces and times. </p>

<p>The essays in this issue thus seek to reposition their author-subjects through and then beyond the materiality of citizenship and prescribed identities toward connection with the other. Such repositionings inevitably raise critical questions: if hegemonic forms of internationalism only serve to aggrandize the imperial self, does transnational criticism desire to draw a correlation between modernist writing and particularized (liberatory) conceptions of transnationalism? Did the modernists, like us, wish to expose the contingency of nation? As many of these essays suggest, the literary genre (the novel and the poem) is not just the container of this desire but its very shape. Genre becomes desire for the subject in and beyond the boundary of the nation, in and beyond the limits of historical period. </p>

<p>This issue displays modernisms in our image&#x2026;always, partially.  </p>

<p>Reading and writing after these essays allows me to pursue the paths of these desires.  </p>

<p>Trans/nationalism&#x2014;the concept as vehicle&#x2014;challenges critics to stretch formerly construed geographies and critical histories for understanding past modernisms. In the resulting implicit or explicit comparisons that transnationalism also urges, we witness simultaneities that are multiple, unequal, and contradictory. </p>

<p>One of the simultaneities emerging strongly from this group of essays is that, within the particular conditions of late-nineteenth century to mid-twentieth century cultural politics, a sense of nationalism is concurrent with supranational linkages.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As the essays in this collection demonstrate&#x2014;Jessica Berman's, Jahan Ramazani's, and Urmila Seshagiri's, for example&#x2014;many modernist authors see nation as contingent upon a sense of belonging and renounce it often because of the shape that nationalist leaders give it. At the same time, while modernist authors supersede national boundaries, they believe in the cultural uniqueness of their respective nations. Trans/nationalism takes the simultaneous and contradictory forms we see across the essays in this issue, for example, in Virginia Woolf's or in C.L.R. James's pan-Africanism. In <i>Three Guineas</i>, Woolf does not renounce her claim to England even as she denounces a masculinist, jingoist Englishness. In "Revolution and the Negro," James celebrates the contributions of Negroes to dominant nations while calling on them to t slavery across nation-state boundaries.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  If, as I suggested above, nationalism is the vessel for modernism and modernity, transnationalism is the hinge between postcolonialism and postmodernity. In this context, can we understand "trans" also as "post"? Does the modernist authors' transgression of national boundaries indicate that they also imagine spaces and times beyond nation itself? As this collection of essays demonstrates, given their particular longing for cultural community as well as resistance to nation as defined by political and cultural hegemonies, trans is only partially post.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Times and spaces not only intersect but are also interpreted and organized variously by subscribers to modernity, including our modernist authors. Nation-states are one manifestation of an organization of times and spaces in which modernist subjects (willing, ambivalent, and resistant) are differently subaltern.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Munoo in Anand's <i>Coolie</i> and Stephen in Joyce's <i>The Portrait</i> are not only na&#x00EF;ve subjects but also native subjects who are positioned unequally both within and across nations; the drawing of comparisons particularly accentuates this, for example, in Jessica Berman's, Laura Doyle's, and Jahan Ramazani's essays. As Susan Friedman indicates, modernists are indeed nonsynchronous; the essays show, however, that this is true both across eras as well as within them. Thus, across this issue, contiguities drawn between James Joyce and Mulk Raj Anand; Jean Rhys and her contemporaries; Lorna Goodison and Edward Kamau Brathwaite as peers of T. S. Eliot, W. B. Yeats, and Ezra Pound; and Nancy Cunard and W. E. B. Du Bois appear differently and unevenly resistant to nation. While the essays individually ascribe a resistant consciousness to the minoritized, they also collectively display dissimilar native-ness in their experience of nation. </p>

<p>These essays further reveal that while transnationalism allows a certain fluidity of exchange and borrowing, and colonial power tilts the balance, another view of the global transnational emerges through the gaze of the native. If "Anand's use of Joycean techniques" serves to highlight the "political implications of <i>Portrait</i>," does comparison only confirm the axes of power? If one looks more closely, however, Anand's juxtaposition of Iqbal and Joyce could indicate something about Anand's own "global" view that reflects back differently than the dominant one, nationalist or colonial. This global view opposes the "parochial," not to transcend the latter but to link it to others in a similar stand against colonialism. Could this motivation to connect the parochial/local to the global also be the basis of solidarity, for example, in the pan-African movement?  </p>

<p>This uneven graph of native-ness emerging from the essays does not allow the contradictory status of indigeneity to be flattened out transnationally. As the essays remind us, modernity invents and defines native-ness to relegate to a constructed and constantly interpreted past. Yet, native-ness is also the confirmation of nation-statehood and modernity itself. Western primitivism in cosmopolitan modernist practices remains incommensurable with emerging nationalist deployment of the notion of the native. For the former, it manifests as an adoption of forms and persona within an economically powerful and culturally experimental environment, such as in Surrealism. For the latter, it emerges as a confirmation of economically and culturally conservative agendas that solidify the uniqueness of one nation-state against another. In other words, the backdrop to the modernist authors showcased in this issue spells a hegemonic transnationalism against their own progressive version in which the "native" is presented differently. </p>

<p>I want to pursue, finally, this issue's depictions of how genre creates subject and how the subject writes a resisting genre. For both the modernist authors and for us, 

<b></b>

in this issue, the genre becomes the very manifestation of desire, not just a container for it. Genre (the modernist novel, the modernist poem) incarnates the actual as well as the imagined nation, its community, and from them both, its readership. The tradition of the Bildungsroman, for example, depends on historicity (the weight and the implications of history), an inescapable awareness for a modernist subject and a subject of modernity. The "failure of the Bildungsroman" discussed here by Jessica Berman's "Comparative Colonialisms: Joyce, Anand, and the Question of Engagement" is less about antidevelopment than about the (im)possibility of self-development as a paradigm. Even as <i>Coolie</i> attempts the impossibility of the biography, this novel is also expressive of the desire to re-do the nation in one's own image. According to traditionalist or conservative practitioners of the genre, marriage was the culmination of the romance novel, civilized maturity the end of the Bildungsroman, and closure the motivation for the poem. The suspension of such ends discussed here in the works of Joyce and Anand (Berman), Rhys (Seshagiri), Brathwaite and Goodison (Ramazani), and Salih (Friedman) spells this ambivalence about historicity. Some anticolonial subjects are (dis)obedient to the meaning of the model for self-development within the nation, as the essays show. They testify to the strength and weakness of the correlation between biographical and national-historical time, demonstrating the same logic by which Fredric Jameson sees the third world novel as an allegory of the nation.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> </p>

<p>Although, as the essays note, modernist disruptions of genre reflect the problematics of posing a totalized modernist subject, the essays demonstrate our persistent desire for a subject, a "visionary" in the form of Jean Rhys, Nancy Cunard, Mulk Raj Anand, or Lorna Goodison, who consciously imagines intellectual and emotional connections beyond the mundane surface of life. At the same time, we must keep in mind that these writers negotiated contradictory ideological frameworks, conventional norms, notions of cultural authenticities, and ideas of hierarchy complicating the landscape of uneven desires exhibited by our modernist protagonists for creating as well as surpassing various identities. A specific point of complexity emerges, for example, in the difference and overlap between "western" and "black" for Nancy Cunard, as we see in Laura Winkiel's essay, or between "race" and "culture" for Jean Rhys, as we see in Urmila Seshagiri's analysis.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  As Laura Doyle comments in her essay on the sexually transgressive in Virginia Woolf's and Nella Larsen's works, her chosen authors remain unevenly "interested" in race or in expressing their "genuine" selves. </p>

<p>Such contradictory modernist subjects, differently native and variously attached to race, culture, and sexuality, face dilemmas about democracy and citizenship for some modernist authors . . . and so do we. These dilemmas are bound up often with the issue of patronage that quite frequently encouraged racial/cultural difference as the path to equality as a citizen&#x2014;Cornelia Sorabji by powerful Englishwomen like Lady Cornelia Ford, Mulk Raj Anand by E. M. Forster, Rabindranath Tagore by T. S. Eliot, Jean Rhys by Madox Ford.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  As Laura Winkiel suggests in this issue, European modernity is not antithetical to black transnationalism; it is a strategic move on the part of various authors like Nancy Cunard and W. E. B. du Bois to advocate for both rights within imperial contexts as well as for national identity. For us, perspectives toward the centers 

<b></b>

and margins shift, marked by our desires. In this issue, Jahan Ramazani's "Modernist Bricolage, Postcolonial Hybridity: Yeats, Eliot, Pound and Postcolonial Poetry" situates colonized poets on one side of authenticity, observing that they incorporated images through violent force and experiential learning, and euromodernists on the other side, remarking that they selected "a mere aspect" occasionally for affect only. Yet the essay evinces ambivalence about whether Eliot, Yeats, and Pound can take part in the "celebration of transregional inheritance" enjoyed by African, Asian, and Caribbean poets. Seshagiri positions Rhys on one side of the modernist/postcolonial binary while Doyle places them on the same. Berman reads Joyce as anxious postcolonial who, like Anand, cannot pose neat endings, while Seshagiri reads Rhys as opposing modernist subscribers to formal experimentation, including James Joyce.  </p>

<p>This disturbance in our landscapes of modernism(s) is actually a logical extension of this collection's efforts to track the conrations of transnational modernities. Consequently also, this issue makes a bold move in re-shaping the times and spaces associated traditionally with modernism(s).  </p>

<p>Spatial terms such as "global" and "planetary" qualify transnationalism to expand the territories of modernisms. In terms of time, their new periodizations and challenges to traditional boundaries become as integral to aesthetics as the material of modernisms analyzed by the authors in this issue. Just as Bildung provides an architecture of the subject/nation, periodization becomes an architecture of eras. In this collection, there is a recurrent assumption that modernist subjects enter modernity as members of independent nation-states. If modernity and colonialism are simultaneous, colonial subjects are already to be counted among the architects of modernity. Susan Friedman echoes Dilip Gaonkar's concern about the inclusion of "people everywhere." Yet, if we agree with Jean-Francois Lyotard that postmodernity is nascent in modernity and that the two are simultaneous in the "post,"could the 1940s&#x2013;1960s (that this issue attempts to include) be termed "transmodernities"?<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The metamorphosis from rigidly structured bureaucratic Fordist organizations of the 1930s&#x2013;1950s to post Cold-War, post-Fordist weblike economic structures and political dynamics conres us as postmodern-aware subjects. For us, the concept of "transnational" does not cancel out a contemplation of modernisms and modernities even as we remain alert to the fundamental shifts in form and vocabulary. </p>

<p>Imagine this issue as a box with "This Side Up" etched on it. The sign refers to both periodization and the situational logic of this piece. I present this afterword as the bottom of this issue and the top of future ones that continue to address the concepts connected in this one, as preface to another conversation.

<p><a name="FOOT1" href="#REF1">1</a>. Literary studies, as distinct from developmental studies, international relations studies, or other inter/disciplines, has developed a specific vocabulary in relation to modernity, modernism, and colonialism. Most discourses related to state, policy, or economics imply that "modernity" is ongoing and "nation" has permanently supplanted "colony" and "empire."

<p id="lead">"It was as if a curtain had fallen, hiding everything I had ever known. It was almost like being born again," muses Anna Morgan, the &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; narrator of Jean Rhys's <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  This 1934 novel about a Creole demimonde illuminates a complex but overlooked genealogical moment in twentieth-century literature: the point when the exhausted limits of modernist form revealed the lineaments of postcolonial fiction. Rhys's semicanonical tale of a chorus-girl-turned-prostitute has generally been read as a key to pre-War London, a novel of female fl&#x00E2;nerie, or one among the author's several fictions of feminine self-destruction.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  In this essay, I argue that in order to understand the English novel's "postcolonial turn" in the middle of the twentieth century, we should revisit <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> and its interventions into British literary modernism. The novel's complex transnationality&#x2014;the contrapuntal geography that oscillates between England and the West Indies&#x2014;gives rise to its transitional literary quality: Rhys produces a new geopolitics that challenges the continued relevance of modernist formal accomplishments, and, simultaneously, inaugurates what would soon become the central goals of postcolonial literature in English. And although <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> has been overshadowed by Rhys's 1966 masterpiece, <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>, it is the earlier novel that shows us a crucial transformation in the aesthetic priorities and political thrust of twentieth-century English fiction. As this fleeting, slight work gradually renders obsolescent the longstanding modernist worship of form, it announces the visionary and revisionary work of a nascent postcolonial literature.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p><i>Voyage in the Dark</i> maps two overlapping arcs: Western imperialism's rise and decline over four centuries, and British modernism's rise and decline over four decades. The novel's very title invokes two earlier modern-imperial texts: <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> looks back to <i>Heart of Darkness</i> , Joseph Conrad's famously inconclusive meditation on colonial praxis, and <i>The Voyage Out</i> , Virginia Woolf's anti-Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman in which a young female protagonist dies abruptly in South America. But the title of Rhys's novel also suggests the uncertain future of aesthetic modernism itself, which by the mid-1930s was no longer able to purchase artistic triumph with its cache of experimental techniques and was, accordingly, voyaging in a kind of darkness. Tyrus Miller's <i>Late Modernism: Politics, Fiction, and the Arts Between the World Wars</i> argues that experimental writing in the late 1920s and early 1930s begins to distance itself from the literature that preceded it; this writing, Miller claims, "loosens the modernist dominance of form and allows a more fluid, dialogic relation with the immediate historical context. It accomplished this unbinding of the work at the cost of abandoning the modernist gold standard: form as the universal currency in which aesthetic value could be measured and calculated."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> turns away from the wonted sacredness of literary form and registers the urgency of engaging an "immediate historical context"; Rhys's novelistic outcry against the limits of modernism anticipates Gy&#x00F6;rgy Luk&#x00E1;cs's polemical attack on the generation of authors who esteemed form to the near-exclusion of other considerations. And while Rhys does not privilege a Luk&#x00E1;csian return to social realism, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> elucidates the dark consequences of what Luk&#x00E1;cs would soon criticize as the "opaque, fragmentary, chaotic and uncomprehended" aestheticization of everyday experience.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>   </p>

<p>As <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> breaks modernism apart by refusing to privilege artistic form, it lays the groundwork for a developing literature of postcoloniality through the many-shaded voice of a Creole protagonist-narrator. Indeed, the novel's opening claim that to arrive in London is "almost like being born again" foretells <i>the</i> defining quality of postcolonial English literature: the advent of the twentieth-century postcolonial novel would not be a literary genre's triumphant renaissance, but would be, like the newly formed nation-states it described, the complicated emergence of a literature inextricably bound to the very culture it sought to escape. To be Creole is to be born displaced, to label as not-home the land of one's birth, and Rhys deploys Anna Morgan's Creole identity to remake the modernist fascination with fragment and fracture into the key problematic of postcoloniality. The Creole subject's multiplicity defies an exact point of geographical and genealogical origin because, as Judith Raiskin points out, Creole identity encompasses "the white native who lives in a cultural space between the European and black Caribbean societies and the native of mixed racial ancestry living in the islands and in England after World War II."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  It is precisely this multiplicity&#x2014;a collocation of subject- and object-positions that both promises and suspends cultural expressiveness&#x2014;that makes <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> a pivotal text in the transition between the downturn of British experimental modernism and the crescendo of postcolonial literature. <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>'s indeterminate beginning, fractured delivery, and inconclusive ending look back to the techniques that demarcated high 

<b></b>

modernism from nineteenth-century realism, but they also look ahead to the historical crises that shape later novels by Chinua Achebe, V. S. Naipaul, and Salman Rushdie. The intricate geopolitics of Anna Morgan's narrative mount a far-reaching challenge to the hegemony of imperial perspectives: the novel's faint oppositional politics, despite Anna's own powerlessness, anticipate the <i>ressentiment</i> that surges through subsequent fictions about Western imperialism's various legacies. And as Rhys turns the Empire's colonizing gaze back on itself, she unravels the violent cultural epistemologies that give form to so much experimental modernism, thereby reimagining English fiction along a new&#x2014;and inevitably transnational&#x2014;axis.  </p>

<p>Published in 1934, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> tells the story of Anna Morgan, the daughter of a Welsh planter in Dominica. Whether describing Dominican childhood or adulthood in England, Anna's first-person narration registers multiple voices: mass advertising, popular and folk songs, plantation catalogues of slave-names, passages from imperial geographical tracts, and English cultural mandates about femininity. These voices further divide Anna's already-fissured narrative perspective, repeatedly calling attention to her status as a permanent outsider who claims neither a native community in Dominica nor an adopted home in England. When Anna arrives in pre-War London at the age of nineteen, she is surprised to find herself violently alienated from the white English people she encounters, whether her working-class flatmates, her wealthy lovers, or well-heeled shopgirls in London's department stores. Her insistent, oft-repeated claim, "I'm a real West Indian," describes an identity that history has robbed of meaning: Dominica's violent, centuries-long colonization at the hands of the Spanish, the French, and the English means that a "real West Indian" could be an indigenous Caribbean Indian, an African slave, a European settler, or (and this is the possibility that haunts the text) a mixture of all three.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Left penniless by her alcoholic father, Anna lives the transient, unstable life of an English chorus-girl; the indifferent metropolis brutalizes her with the seductions of consumerism and the ease of anonymous sexual encounters. When Anna's stepmother cuts her off and her first lover, Walter, abandons her, Anna spirals into alcoholism, relying on the patronage of various sexual partners until she faces an accidental pregnancy. In the novel's original ending, which Michael Sadleir of Constable and Company forced Rhys to change, Anna dies from a bungled abortion. In the revised and now-standard ending, Anna lies on the doctor's operating table being treated for a post-abortion hemorrhage, remembering a Caribbean carnival from her childhood, and preparing to "start all over again . . ." (<small class="caps">v</small>, 188). Neither version allows postcolonial identity to be assimilated into extant forms of modern-imperial narratives in the 1930s: and so Anna's "voyage" ends uneasily, twisting in a cultural limbo that has yet to find a self-assured literary voice.  </p>

<p>As a fulcrum between experimental modernism and postcolonial literature, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> alters the literary stakes of <i>metropolitan perception</i>. The emergence of new social, psychological, and aesthetic modes of metropolitan perception in the twentieth century, as Raymond Williams has influentially argued, launched high modernism's dazzling experiments; the experience of an imperial and industrial metropolis&#x2014;alienating, exhilarating, relentlessly new&#x2014;fueled linguistic, visual, musical, and theatrical 

<b></b>

revolution in modernism's European centers.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  It is by now understood that the radical aesthetic gestures that grew out of these new modes of metropolitan perception are inseparable from imperial praxis. Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century imperial expansion around the globe meant that the daily life that constitutes the content of national literature, as Fredric Jameson puts it, "can no longer be grasped immanently; it no longer has its meaning, its deeper reason for being within itself."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Modernism's formal devices often compensate for the lost totality of imperial modernity: experimental modern art answered the formal dilemma posed by the imperial metropole's inability to locate meaning fully within itself. But in <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, the keen global awareness that shapes Anna Morgan's "metropolitan perception" fails to yield up the rich aesthetic rewards available to an earlier generation of modernist authors and artists. As Rhys's protagonist journeys from colonial Dominica to London and then relives her journey through dreams, memories, and hallucinations, the distinction between center and periphery dissolves into a nightmarish unreality in which the narrative breaks free of Anna's control. Anna's psychic inability to separate her material experience of the imperial metropole from her memories of colonial Dominica&#x2014;itself a fractured, overwritten, long-lost totality&#x2014;makes unhappy chaos of modernist faith in the liberatory potential of reordering time and space. Despite the longing for a stable, unitary perspective that pervades Anna's fragmented narration, her transnational Creolit&#x00E9; reorients modernist metropolitan perception so that it no longer calls either stories or subjects into being. As Rhys's novel unmasks the faltering self-conscious artistry of the moderns, it offers a proleptic glimpse into how postcolonial literature would appropriate that artistry and repoliticize modernist modes of metropolitan perception. By this novel's elliptical and unproductive final page, the experience of the fast-paced imperial center has been foundationally altered by the intrusions of its Caribbean colonies. It is a startlingly astute prediction of the later oeuvre of postcolonial fiction, which would decentralize Western imperial capitals as it illuminated narratives obscured or devalued by colonialism. And while Rhys's Creole &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; finds herself powerless and paralyzed within early twentieth-century London's "high, smooth, unclimbable walls" (<i>V</i>,147), the novel's fascination with modern urban culture nonetheless hints at the rise of "metrocolonial" novels at the century's end, those fictions by writers like Salman Rushdie and Zadie Smith celebrating the multilayered racial parfaits of Bombay, London, and New York.  </p>

<p>The publication history of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> spans the intellectual contours of literary modernism and places Rhys at the heart of London and Paris modernism in the 1910s and 1920s. <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> went through several incarnations before its eventual publication in 1934, and its multiple titles and revised endings&#x2014;as well as the twenty-year time lag between first draft and final publication&#x2014;suggest the novel's growing distance from the early modernist moment in which it was conceived. Rhys originally drafted the novel in 1911, writing it in diary-form in a series of black exercise books purchased at a London stationer's; dissatisfied with the story, she put the notebooks away in a suitcase and turned her energies toward writing short fiction. Ten years later, when Rhys was living in Paris, her husband&#x2014;a writer named Jean Lenglet&#x2014;was 

<b></b>

imprisoned for fraud; Rhys tried to support herself by selling translations of Lenglet's stories to a Mrs. Pearl Adam, the wife of a <i>Times</i> correspondent. Mrs. Adam did not care for Lenglet's work, but expressed an interest in Rhys's own writing. Impressed by the earliest version of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, which Rhys had tentatively named "Triple Sec," Mrs. Adam began to edit Rhys's drafts. She introduced Rhys to Ford Madox Ford, who had moved from London to Paris after the War to continue his patronage of new writers; as founding editor of the <i>transatlantic review</i>, Ford was bringing out new literature by Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, and William Carlos Williams.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Ford preferred Rhys's short stories to the early draft of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, and in 1924 he published "Vienne," a piece about French expatriates in Vienna, in the <i>transatlantic review</i>. "Vienne" took its place in Rhys's first full-length volume of work, a 1927 collection of short stories titled <i>The Left Bank</i> for which Ford penned the introduction.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In 1934, following the publication of her second work&#x2014;a 1928 Paris novel originally titled <i>Postures</i> and later re-named <i>Quartet</i>&#x2014;Rhys revised <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> and sent it to the London publishers Chatto and Windus, who rejected it. Rhys then sent her manuscript (at that point titled "Two Tunes") to Constable, where Michael Sadleir accepted the manuscript but insisted that Rhys alter the ending so that Anna Morgan would live rather than die following her abortion.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Rhys reluctantly made the change, which she regretted for the rest of her authorial career.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In 1985, six years after Rhys's death, Nancy Hemond Brown discovered and published the novel's original ending in <i>London Magazine</i>, restoring Rhys's preferred conclusion in which Anna Morgan waits for the moment when "everything is blotted out and blackness comes . . ." instead of preparing to "start all over again. . . ."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This complex publication history&#x2014;from the novel's fragmented conception in pre-War London to its first revision in Paris during the 1920s and its eventual publication in London in the mid-1930s&#x2014;provides a metaphor for the very cultural transition it describes: the collapse of the exuberant literary experiments that had buoyed up the English novel since the fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle, and the rise of a new literature that explores a world torn asunder by the forces of Western imperialism. In her autobiography <i>Smile Please</i>, Rhys herself described the novel's inception in a chapter appropriately called "World's End, and a Beginning," a title whose two halves symbolize the literary metamorphosis that <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> enacts. The chapter's title refers to the London neighborhood where Rhys was living when she drafted the first "Black Exercise Book" version of the novel; Mary Lou Emery's influential study of Rhys (called, in fact, <i>Jean Rhys at "World's End</i>") claims that the phrase "world's end" evokes "urban spaces marginalized by the appearance of solitary women in public, the Caribbean islands invaded and possessed by Europeans, and the islands and urban Europe upset in the process of decolonization."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Retroactively, and in the context of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, I would add that the phrase also suggests two other "ends": the end of pre-War English tranquility, and, two decades later, the end of experimental modernism. The "Beginning" of the <i>Smile Please</i> chapter title refers to the starting point of Rhys's vocation as a writer, but also suggests the "beginning" of an entirely new literature: the artistic domain of post-coloniality, in which the priorities of high modernism acquire a radically different political charge.

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>I do not wish to imply that a stark polarity divides modern and postcolonial literature. As my earlier mention of Conrad and Woolf reminds us, modernist authors devoted as much time to the nuances of colonialism as postcolonial authors have since devoted to artistic form. But I do wish to demonstrate that in the evolution of the twentieth-century English novel, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> quietly announces a cultural shift, a literary moment as significant for what it departs from as for what it moves toward. Unlike Wyndham Lewis's <i>BLAST</i> and other early modernist texts, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> does not issue a clarion call to revolutionize literature and art. Neither does Rhys's novel repudiate enshrined genres of the English literary canon, as would postcolonial fictions like Achebe's <i>Things Fall Apart</i>  and Rhys's own <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> in subsequent decades. The Yeatsian title and Nigerian folktale structure of Achebe's novel&#x2014;like <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>'s simultaneous resistance and indebtedness to <i>Jane Eyre</i>&#x2014;would offer a <i>productive</i> intellectual tension between Western cultural dominance and the indigenous narrative forms that predated that culture's arrival. But the tense coexistence of literary forms in Rhys's 1934 novel is unproductive, indeed, as the protagonist's abortion suggests, antiproductive. Like Anna Morgan, whose body has been emptied of its child and then forced to "start all over again," the very structure of English fiction now begins to empty itself of modernism's cherished vitality and to move toward the cultural and artistic terrain in which postcolonial literature would subsequently flourish.  </p>

<p>How does <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> subordinate modernist formal innovation to the imperative of authoring postcoloniality? Edward Said's <i>Beginnings</i>, appropriately, furnishes a useful entry point into this novel's insistence on new literary priorities. In Said's formulation, European modernism was "an aesthetic and ideological phenomenon that was a response to the crisis of what could be called <i>filiation</i>&#x2014;a linear, biologically grounded process, that which ties children to their parents&#x2014;which produced the counter-crises within modernism of affiliation, that is, those creeds, philosophies, and visions re-assembling the world in new non-familial ways."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The conflicts that define the formal logic of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> arise from the twin crises of filiation and affiliation, crises that Rhys reveals as integral to the very Caribbean into which Anna Morgan is born. The Caribbean islands where Christopher Columbus landed in 1492 represent the complex originary point of European imperialism: master-narratives of modern Western history call the Caribbean into being only through its resistant or dependent relationship to European rule and conquest. Simon Gikandi argues that Caribbean identity has always been caught in a "paradox of history," because "for Columbus and the European conquerors, the 'discovery' of the Caribbean initiated modernity; but . . . the implication of this modernity for the natives of the islands and African slaves was nothing less than the loss of cultures, physical annihilation, and historical displacement."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Born in Dominica, where Columbus landed on his Second Voyage in 1493, Anna Morgan emblematizes this paradox of history: her tale's point 

<b></b>

of origin is fraught with uncertainty, and the narrative's often-incoherent elements reflect the similar incoherence of her Caribbean Creole heritage. Further, the familial lineage that is an obsession in this novel raises broader questions about the lineage of novels and nations themselves, questions that cannot be resolved through modernist experiments with time, space, and consciousness, but must seek their answers in new narrative strategies. Anna's disrupted racial genealogy, consequently, expresses itself in the novel's disruptions of English literary genealogy. </p>

<p>One of Anna's London flatmates unintentionally strikes at the heart of Anna's cultural and familial anxieties when she sneers, "You're not all there; you're a half-potty bastard. You're not all there; that's what's the matter with you" (<i>V</i>,145). This jibe, however crudely phrased, suggests that the dislocations of Creole identity and the ambiguity of Anna's parentage have profoundly destabilized Anna's consciousness. Anna grows up on Constance Estate, a Dominican plantation owned for four generations by her mother's family and brought to prosperity through slave labor. Following Anna's mother's sudden and unexplained death, Anna's father marries an Englishwoman named Hester, who struggles to restore the family's long-lost image of undifferentiated Englishness. Insinuating not only that Anna's mother was a "coloured" woman rather than a white descendant of English settlers, Hester also rails against Ramsay Colterus, Anna's uncle who has fathered several children by Dominican women and has "the laugh of a negro":  </p>

<p class="continued">As Hester's diatribe suggests, Anna has been racially compromised by the incomplete or broken ties that divide the Morgan family. Between the stepmother who replaces her dead, racially ambiguous mother and the uneasy kinship with her illegitimate "cousins," Anna has slipped into a vague cultural interstice between "lady" and "nigger." Keen to protect Anna from what Homi Bhabha has famously termed the "not quite/not white" predicament of colonial identity, Hester warns her stepdaughter against "the sins of the fathers" who have for generations raped slave women on the plantation.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  (Indeed, the family's legacy of racial and sexual exploitation torments Anna when she becomes Walter's mistress in London: sexual encounters with an English lover stir up Anna's troubled memories of Constance Estate slave rolls.) Ordering Anna to embrace the racial fictions of British imperial self-fashioning, Hester insists that she cut off her close friendship with Francine, the black plantation cook partially responsible for Anna's behaving "exactly like a nigger."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Anna's "affiliation" with Francine&#x2014;a childhood intimacy that inspires Anna's pronouncement, "I hated being white"&#x2014;foundationally threatens the codes of white 

<b></b>

Caribbean plantocracy (<i>V</i>, 72). Historically, British colonials abroad worked strenuously to preserve an image of cultural unity, a strategic essentialism aided by race-science, propaganda, and commodities from the imperial center.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  A striking passage from James Anthony Froude's widely read 1887 study <i>The English in the West Indies, or, The Bow of Ulysses</i>, lauds this unity: "being one the British people everywhere intend to remain one. With the same blood, the same language, the same habits, the same traditions, they do not mean to be shattered into dishonoured fragments."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  But Anna's behaviour in Dominica shatters the myth of Englishness into the very "dishonoured fragments" that imperial mores are meant to deter. Certainly, as Hester points out, mixed-race children abound in the Dominica of Anna's childhood, but neither miscegenation nor interracial sexual desire disrupts the race-plot that buttresses colonialism. The sexual availability of colonial women and the offspring of mixed-race alliances belong firmly in the racial logic through which Western European empires justified their cultural and material authority.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  However, Anna's declaration that "I wanted to be black, I always wanted to be black. . . . Being black is warm and gay, being white is cold and sad" reveals a dangerous desire to <i>be</i> the Empire's other, to locate subjectivity in what imperial discourse has relegated to object-status (<i>V</i>, 31).  </p>

<p>Anna's friendship with Francine comes to an abrupt end when Anna begins to menstruate; the beginning of sexual adulthood corresponds to the end of racial childhood. When Hester mandates the end of the friendship, Anna realizes that the racial elasticity she cherishes in her imagination has no place on a British plantation: "But I knew that of course she [Francine] disliked me too because I was white; and that I would never be able to explain to her that I hated being white. Being white and getting like Hester, and all the things you get&#x2014;old and sad and everything. . . . And I knew that day I'd started to grow old and nothing could stop it" . Forbidden from rejecting the cultural identity that accompanies her skin color but unable to comply with that identity's demands, Anna subsequently falls prey to the fissured familial, racial, and national ties of her Creole birth. Her liminality as a modern-imperial subject surfaces tellingly when, as an adult living in London, she recites a passage from a textbook of Dominican history: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The Caribbean Sea. 'The Caribs indigenous to this island were a warlike tribe and their resistance to white domination, though spasmodic, was fierce. As lately as the beginning of the nineteenth century they raided one of the neighbouring islands, under British rule, overpowered the garrison and kidnapped the governor, his wife and three children. The few hundreds that are left do not intermarry with the Negroes. Their reservation, at the northern end of the island, is known as 'the Carib Quarter.' They had, or used to have, a king. Mopo, his name was. Here's to Mopo, King of the Caribs! But, they are practically exterminated.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Anna's glacial delivery of this passage reveals that none of its subject-positions describes her place in Dominica: if she is not a youthful member of the British governing class for whom such histories affirm a tradition of conquest, neither does she claim kinship with the Carib Indians who survived European invasion or the Negro slaves brought 

<b></b>

forcibly to Dominica. Her claim that she is a "real West Indian" points only to her troubled status within the "paradox of history"; it does not affix her place within the mosaic of contradictory identities that comprises the Caribbean. In other words, Anna's ambivalence towards colonial discourses and their attendant power structures expels her from private as well as public imperial histories. </p>

<p>Peter Hulme observes in his brilliant study <i>Remnants of Conquest: The Island Caribs and Their Visitors: 1877&#x2013;1998</i> that "there really was no position&#x2014;certainly no respectable position&#x2014;within Dominican society that could be occupied by a white person not fully committed to imperial norms of behaviour" (<i>RC</i>, 240&#x2013;1). Having disavowed the whiteness that signifies political, moral, and intellectual authority in the colonies, Anna cannot move into any of the cultural plots available to English protagonists of imperial fiction. Her Creole identity, coupled with her impossible desire to be black, sets her apart from her peers and predecessors in early twentieth-century novels of Empire. Unlike Kipling's Kim, Anna can neither revel in hybridity nor claim a place in the ruling culture; unlike Marlow in <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, Anna cannot tell her own story, because her voice is interrupted and overwritten by the forces of colonial history and contemporary mass culture alike; unlike Adela Quested in Forster's <i>A Passage to India</i>, Anna cannot travel as a tourist or return to a nation she once called home; and unlike John Flory in Orwell's <i>Burmese Days</i>, Anna cannot die a spectacular death that will eventually become absorbed into the fabric of colonial lore. And even though many of these other protagonists come to unsatisfying or tragic conclusions, their conclusions unfold within the longstanding racial and cultural matrix of imperial narratives. The ellipses that end Marlow's tale in <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and the "Not yet" that concludes <i>A Passage to India</i>, for example, do not significantly dislodge the West's continued ideological or material dominance over its far-flung colonies. But the ellipses that end Anna Morgan's story denote the troubled beginnings of a new historical and literary moment, one that finds no meaningful self-expression either in established forms of imperial fiction or, as we will see, in the experimental possibilities of high modernism.  </p>

<p>In words evocative of Woolf's famous description of "beautiful caves" in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, Rhys wrote in a letter to Evelyn Scott that she intended <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> to reveal "Something to do with time being an illusion I think. I mean that the past exists&#x2014;side by side&#x2014;with the present, not behind it; that what was&#x2014;is. I tried to do it by making the past (the West Indies) very vivid&#x2014;the present dreamlike (downward career of girl)&#x2014;starting of course piano and ending fortissimo."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  But unlike Woolf's 1925 novel, in which the narrative simultaneity of past and present offers up powerful resistance to the tyrannies of industrial modernity, the temporal kaleidoscopes of Rhys's 1934 novel are neither enabling nor enlightening. The radicalizing gestures that freed Woolf from the externally focused realism of her Victorian and Edwardian forebears&#x2014;the transcription of interiority, free indirect discourse, the fluid alternation between <i>temps</i> and <i>dur&#x00E9;e</i>&#x2014;here signal only a literary emptiness. Consider this passage, in which Anna describes her departure from Dominica and arrival into England: </p>

<p class="continued">Exiled from a Caribbean in which she is neither subject nor sovereign and lost in a London that promises but never delivers the transformations of fashion and upward mobility, Anna's consciousness becomes a repository for the variously menacing discourses of coloniality and metropolitan modernity. These discourses intersect her narrative in much the same way that geographical coordinates crisscross Dominica or the train windows divide England; and precision about urban and colonial geographies only ironizes the more fundamental dislocations of Anna's own identity and her inability to take her place in the island of her birth or the nation of her putative ancestry. Neither does urban fl&#x00E2;nerie&#x2014;the cultivated placelessness of the moderns&#x2014;protect Anna from the brutalities of city life. Anna's experience of detached transnationality, whether performing as a chorus-girl, dating anonymous men, or shopping on Oxford Street, only heightens her profound desire for belonging. As she moves through London "like a fish out of water," as Hester says, the city's proliferating voices compromise her authorial control. Rather than engendering a Baudelairean odyssey through the metropolis, the multiplication of narrative perspectives only produces bleak, unending alienation. </p>

<p>This alienation expresses itself in Rhys's emendations to the modernist Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman, a subversive genre in its own right that nevertheless cannot deliver Anna Morgan into social stability or heightened self-knowledge. If the Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman was the literary form par excellence of the nineteenth century, we can attribute the rise of early twentieth-century modernism, in part, to a reaction against Victorian realist novels of development. In Franco Moretti's words, experimental modernism's emergence was marked by a "crisis of the European <i>Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman</i>," because the novel of the modern world "could no longer be the <i>Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman</i> which, in all its diverse manifestations, had always held fast to the notion that <i>the biography of a young individual was the most meaningful viewpoint for the understanding and the evaluation of history.</i>"<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The well-known modernist repudiation of the Victorian Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman rewrites the chronological passage from youth to adulthood in a number of aesthetically spectacular and politically radical ways. Modernism's often-rudderless protagonists variously resist the individual socialization that was Victorian fiction's cherished telos, casting aside family, marriage, property, religion, and respectability&#x2014;the very filiation and affiliation that 

<b></b>

Said describes in <i>Beginnings</i>&#x2014;in favor of art, martyrdom, rebellion, or death. Experiments with time and consciousness, and the new self-reflexive creation of art, offer the richest sites for escaping linear and cultural chronology, so that Conrad's Jim, Woolf's Lily Briscoe, Joyce's Stephen Dedalus, and Lawrence's Paul Morel elect to occupy private worlds of their own making rather than integrating themselves into the public world of bourgeois normativity. But the newness, youth, and refusal of conventional adulthood that are the modernist Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman's signature traits only lead to stasis and paralysis in <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>   </p>

<p>To be sure, Anna tries to consolidate her London experiences into a coherent coming-of-age narrative. But the chronological birth-to-death tropes of the conventional Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman prove inadequate for her experiences, and high modernism's nonlinear chronologies paralyze rather than liberate the narrative. To describe her arrival in England on the first page of the novel, as we have already seen, Anna claims that "It was almost like being born again"; the asymptotic quality of her opening pronouncement leads into a narrative in which neither sequentially nor randomly ordered events produce maturity or agency. Although Anna tells herself that "This is a beginning . . . I'll go to all the lovely places I've ever dreamt of. This is the beginning," revels in summer days that "made me start again imagining that there was nothing I couldn't do, nothing I couldn't become," and hopes that "Something else will happen&#x2026;and then something else, and then something else. It'll be all right," the "almostness" of her life in London prevents her from recording its progression in linear or self-contained narrative (<i>V</i>, 28, 157, 171). From Anna's palindromic name to her description of London streets "going north, south, east, west, all exactly alike," the novel bursts with metaphors of paralysis and directionlessness: stopped clocks, dead-end streets, walled-in gardens, lopped trees, unsent letters, movies starring "Three-Fingered Kate," songs titled "The Girl I Left Behind Me" and "There's a Brown Girl in a Ring," and books such as <i>The Iron Shroud</i> and, of course, <i>Nana</i>, Emile Zola's 1880 novel about a doomed prostitute whose name (and premature death) anagrammatically foreshadow Anna's fate.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Like Zeno's arrow, Anna tries to move forward without ever reaching her desired end point; even as she offers a pithy summation of her romance with Walter&#x2014; "There was a man I was mad about. He got sick of me and chucked me. I wish I were dead" &#x2014;she names a goal that she cannot realize (<i>V,</i> 115). Her "voyage in the dark," with its uncertain starting point and indefinite destination, comprises a series of stalled beginnings that extends into the novel's final page, when Anna lies bleeding on the doctor's operating table listening to his prediction that she will soon be "'Ready to start all over again in no time'" (<i>V</i>, 187).  </p>

<p>Rhys's dismantling of the modern Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman sets the stage for the novel's most powerful repudiation of radical modernist aesthetics. Adrift in London and moving aimlessly between jobs, apartments, and men, Anna dreams of being on a ship "that was sailing very close to an island, which was home except that the trees were all wrong. These were English trees" (<i>V</i>, 164). In the confusion about whether the island is Dominica or part of the British Isles, Anna's dream becomes a nightmare version of her early claim that "Sometimes it was as if I were back there and as if England were a dream. At 

<b></b>

other times England was the real thing and out there was the dream, but I could never fit them together" (<i>V</i>, 8). Memories of the past have become indistinguishable from lived experience in the present, and sleep has become indistinguishable from waking. This traumatic temporal and perceptual chaos produces the novel's metacommentary on its own literary technique: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I was still trying to walk up the deck and get ashore. I took huge, climbing, flying strides among confused res. I was powerless and very tired, but I had to go on.

<p class="continued">A "climax of meaninglessness" is the unavoidable result of modernist excess: the psychic and experiential merging of England and the Caribbean, the linguistic shifts from English to French to Creole patois, and the narrative's transparent self-consciousness collide in Anna's plaint against the "fatigue and powerlessness" of formal experimentation. Metropolitan perception&#x2014;the creative fount of Rhys's literary predecessors&#x2014;fails to transform lived experience into gratifying artistic form, and Anna's desperate dream-effort to "walk up the deck and get ashore" furnishes a penetrating metaphor for the late modernist move to abandon the worship of formal mastery. In <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, the provocative, restorative, and liberating aesthetic gestures of high modernism become uncontrolled attempts to consolidate what history has irrevocably fractured. </p>

<p>Darkly, Anna's pregnancy&#x2014;itself a "climax of meaninglessness"&#x2014;is the only element of this novel that arrives at an unambiguous conclusion. After Walter abandons her and she begins sleeping with strangers, Anna realizes that she is pregnant while dancing with an unnamed man in her flat. Gripped by waves of nausea, she listens to the song "<i>Connais-tu le Pays?</i>" and thinks bitterly, "Do you know the country? Of course, if you know the country it makes all the difference."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The song filters through Anna's recognition that she is pregnant: </p>

<p class="continued">The nausea that is "[l]ike seasickness" counterposed against the lyrics of "<i>Connais-tu le Pays?</i>" suggests that Anna is embarking on yet another voyage, one intimately bound up in knowledge of nationhood: human reproduction is inseparable from the production of national identities. Pregnancy intensifies the cultural ambivalence that history has thrust upon Anna, and the baby's uncertain paternity furthers the mysteries and erasures of Anna's already-fractured lineage. Anna's futile efforts to induce a miscarriage deepen her sense of entrapment: "And all the time thinking round and round in a circle that it is there inside me, and about all the things I had taken so that if I had it, it would be a monster. The Abb&#x00E9; Sebastian's Pills, primrose label, one guinea 

<b></b>

<p>Anna's speculation that the baby might be an eyeless or limbless "monster" bespeaks not only fear of drug-induced birth defects, but more importantly, a primal anxiety about her own racial heritage: the baby's potential deformities raise the spectre of the "monstrous races" long thought to inhabit the Caribbean Basin. The ghost of Columbus's 1492 landing haunts Anna's pregnancy, notably the famous passage in the Discoverer's <i>Diario</i> claiming that the islands harbored "one-eyed men, and others, with snouts of dogs, who ate men, and that as soon as one was taken they cut his throat and drank his blood and cut off his genitals."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The moving horizon of the Euro-Caribbean encounter has earlier shed light on Anna's own disruptive position vis-&#x00E0;-vis colonial history; as the encounter resurfaces in Anna's fears about her unborn child, it forecasts European colonialism's tragic legacy. In a novel whose deepest anxieties fixate on racial belonging, Anna Morgan's inchoate baby symbolizes yet another unassimilable racial identity. The baby's doubly ambiguous lineage conspires to destroy it: Anna's child will inherit not only the Caribbean's centuries-long "crisis of filiation" represented by the unresolved identity of Anna's late mother, but also the detotalizing experience of metropolitan modernity represented by its anonymous, absent father. The abortion, accordingly, represents the racially encrypted body's ultimate dis-integration, a violent literalizing of Anna's psychic disunity and her exile from the domains of imperial modernity. And although the bastard half-children of a hybrid past eventually become the heroes of postcolonial literature (almost fifty years later, Rushdie's Saleem Sinai would open <i>Midnight's Children</i> with the gleeful remark, "I was born in the city of Bombay . . . once upon a time. No, that won't do." ), <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> consigns such children to scorn, invisibility, and death.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Anna finally becomes unrecognizable to herself, her consciousness splitting between the competing narratives of colonialism and urban modernity. The voices that have interrupted her storytelling become overtly menacing in the novel's last scene, where cascading prose shifts between a Masquerade carnival in the West Indies, Anna's memories of Walter, and the experience of the doctor's office. As the doctor anesthetizes her, Anna's thoughts mirror the aleatory, nonlinear pattern of her movements through cultures: </p>

<p class="continued">This scene describes a total emotional dissolution precipitated by the disjuncture between the white surface of Anna's skin and the interior experiences of racial and cultural hybridity that it conceals. And the literal hemorrhage of Anna's body in this final scene symbolizes the hemorrhage of modernist forms: Anna's various cultural identities, all of which are called up in her hallucination, have become, like extant forms of modern aesthetics in the 1930s, discrepant, excessive, and unassimilable. The anaesthetic that the doctor administers not only robs Anna of sensuous perception, but also signals the text's resistance to self-conscious artistry itself: an-aesthetic. Despite Anna's multiple attempts to control the sequence of her narrative from childhood to adulthood, the privileged act of telling her own story fails to furnish an end in itself. Because her narrative contains as many voices as she herself has cultural parents, she collapses under the accumulated weight of public and private histories, her voice obscured by the very polyvocality and pastiche that had ushered in so many exhilarating possibilities for earlier modern protagonists. And whereas the modernist reworking of the Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman rejected the chronological sequence that began with youth and ended with mature adulthood, Jean Rhys goes one step further and challenges the very birth and death that are the implicit boundaries of even the most anticonventional modernist novels. Through Anna's own mysterious parentage, her "re-birth" upon entering England, the aborted life of her child, her thwarted desire to die, and the revised ending of the novel itself, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> troubles the foundational conditions of imperial life-writing as well as the modern English Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman. Moving beyond the outermost limits of English modernist experimentation, Rhys ushers in the protocols of the genre that would dominate English literature in the second half of the twentieth century: the postcolonial novel.  </p>

<p>In 1972, V. S. Naipaul praised Rhys's "purity as a novelist" and declared that "Jean Rhys thirty to forty years ago identified many of the themes that engage us today: isolation, an absence of society or community, the sense of things falling apart, dependence, loss."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Naipaul referred to the first generation of postcolonial novels in English, those works deeply engaged with the formal conventions of canonical English novels and intent on restoring what imperialism had erased or marginalized. The second half of the twentieth century witnessed the rise of deliberate, provocative anti-Bild&#x00FC;ngsromane that repudiated the consolidation of the national subject by making irresolution and placelessness their most powerful subversions. From Chinua Achebe's <i>Things Fall </i>

<b></b>

<i>Apart</i>  and Naipaul's <i>A House for Mr. Biswas</i>  to Tsitsi Dangarembga's <i>Nervous Conditions</i>  and Jamaica Kincaid's <i>Lucy</i> , postcolonial authors have extended <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>'s reworking of the English Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman to explore the failed promises of modernity, capitalism, and liberal self-fashioning. In these dark fictions of postcoloniality, protagonists do not mature or take their places in stable social hierarchies; neither do they arrive at self-knowledge through the act of telling their own stories. Rohinton Mistry's 1997 novel <i>A Fine Balance</i> offers a stunning coda to its predecessors: Mistry's Dickensian recreation of postindependence India demonstrates that the desire for marriage, children, education, and class mobility&#x2014;in short, the defining goals of the 19<sup>th</sup>-century Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman&#x2014;leads inexorably to poverty, castration, amputation, and death. Exile and rootlessness, instruments of subversion in earlier postcolonial novels, serve here as the mildest consequences of the West's often-fatal legacy of progress. </p>

<p>Naipaul's 1972 praise for Rhys's prescience continues to ring true more than three decades later. As a new strain of late twentieth-century postcolonial fiction joined these earlier works, the tense counterpoint of center and colony gave way to a fresh subgenre: the metrocolonial novel. The works of Zadie Smith and the recent writings of Salman Rushdie, as I have mentioned earlier, as well as novels by Hanif Kureishi, Monica Ali, and M. G. Vassanji, refuse to equate marginality with exile and invite readers into the multicultural ebullience of London, New York, Nairobi, and Boston. Such fictions, while still committed to teasing out the tangled origins of history, bring a new headiness to their description of the present moment. Tempering political outrage with tremendous humor, metrocolonial novels offer an intense distillation of a cosmopolitan present whose "transnational decentredness," as John Clement Ball puts it, "has become its most visibly constitutive feature."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  And although <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> could not secure a place for Anna Morgan in modern London's cityscapes, Anna's literary successors move through former capitals of imperial power undaunted by their historical status as Empire's second-class citizens. Racial hybridity, cultural multiplicity, and geographical restlessness no longer hold life-narratives hostage, but instead illuminate the mercurial labyrinths of national and familial history.  </p>

<p>And in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we find the most recent innovations to this novelistic tradition in the writings of the South African Nobel laureate J. M. Coetzee. Coetzee's skilled hands have shaped the postcolonial novel into its latest form and given the genre a new focal point: the loosely connected lectures, letters, and short stories that comprise his 2003 work <i>Elizabeth Costello</i> suggest that old age holds more substantive and tragic terrain than youth. In this work about an Australian writer&#x2014;as well as in its successor, <i>Slow Man</i> &#x2014;the mere fact of death trivializes even the most brutal historical narratives. Coetzee sets aside postcolonial literature's longstanding obsession with history and origins to lay bare the obscene, ineluctable processes of aging and human mortality. Neither metropole nor periphery, imperial center or colonial borderland, can command the focus of Coetzee's latest fictions: the particulars of postcoloniality pale next to the universal fragility of the human body, a fragility that stands far outside of history. In a world whose boundaries become daily more porous, there is nothing 

<b></b>

more transnational than death. And so almost seventy five years after the publication of Jean Rhys's <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, we find that Anna Morgan's passage between almost-birth and almost-death uncannily presages the English novel's trajectory: Rhys's slender novel anticipated the postcolonial phoenix that would rise out of experimental modernism's ashes. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>. Jean Rhys's authorial influence has until very recently been subordinated to the facts of Rhys's own life. Overwhelmingly, scholarship about Rhys's fiction diminishes her contributions to twentieth-century literature by correlating biographical events with events in her fiction. For example, studies ranging from Thomas Staley's <i>Jean Rhys: A Critical Study</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1979) and Arnold Davidson's <i>Jean Rhys</i> (New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company, 1985) to Paula Le Gallez's <i>The Jean Rhys Woman</i> (London: Macmillan, 1990) and Stanford Sternlicht's <i>Jean Rhys</i> (London: Twayne Publishers/Prentice Hall International, 1997) take as their point of departure the assumption that, to quote a 1967 <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> review, "All Jean Rhys's novels deal essentially with the same unhappy situation in different guises" ("Neurotic Women," <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> [20 July 1967] 644). Most recently, this kind of reductive portrayal appears in Joseph Wiesenfarth's astonishingly misogynistic <i>Ford Madox Ford and the Regiment of Women: Violet Hunt, Jean Rhys, Stella Bowen, Janice Biala</i> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005). Wiesenfarth attributes all of Rhys's fiction to her "need to portray herself as a helpless victim of a scheming man with a pimping wife" and dismisses her as "nothing more than a drunken, nymphomaniacal liar" (74, 89). </p>

<div class="fn">
<p>In a piece for <i>Harper's Magazine</i> published a year before her death, Rhys revealed her contempt for depictions of her life's work: "Inaccuracies occur, for people must be entertained. So now I can read calmly of my dark dreadful life, extraordinary versions of my first marriage, that I worked on stage for ten bob a week (this last annoys me), but as a rule I don't turn a hair" ("Making Bricks Without Straw," orig. published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> [July 1978] 70&#x2013;1; reprinted in <i>Critical Perspectives on Jean Rhys,</i> ed. Pierrette M. Frickey [Washington, D. C.: Three Continents Press, 1990], 37). Contemporary scholarship has worked to overwrite these "inaccuracies" and restore Rhys's significance to modernist, feminist, and postcolonial studies. Three notable examples are Mary Lou Emery, <i>Jean Rhys at "World's End": Novels of Colonial and Sexual Exile</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), Elaine Savory, <i>Jean Rhys</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 1998), and Deborah Parson, <i>Streetwalking the Metropolis: Women, the City, and Modernity</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000). </p>

take possession of Dominica, the Caribs managed to resist Spanish settlement attempts for over a century. The French ruled Dominica from 1635&#x2013;1660, but lost the island to Britain in 1763 following a century of rivalry during which both nations imported slaves from numerous African countries into the island. Dominica remained a British possession for the next two hundred years. In 1967, Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom, and in 1978&#x2014;one year before Jean Rhys's death&#x2014;the United Kingdom granted independence to the Commonwealth of Dominica.

Purity?

Both products showcase British imperial control: the cocoa is a natural resource from the Caribbean that has been imported into England and turned into something "pure," whereas the biscuits are a domestic product intended to export the "freshness" of English culture around the world. Anna mocks the racially charged ideas of freshness and purity, challenging the manufactured images of desirability and dominance that the Empire projects through even the smallest commodities.

<p id="lead">In Walter Benjamin's 1931 essay, "Unpacking My Library," he remarks that  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is no living library that does not harbor a number of booklike creations from fringe areas. They need not be stick-in albums or family albums, autograph books or portfolios containing pamphlets or religious tracts; some people become attached to leaflets and prospectuses, others to handwriting facsimiles or typewritten copies of unobtainable books; and certainly periodicals can form the prismatic fringes of a library.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This essay considers Nancy Cunard's <i>Negro: An Anthology </i> as a "booklike creation from a fringe area." As Benjamin suggests, these border paraphernalia can take the form of scrapbooks, political ephemera&#x2014;such as manifestos&#x2014;and other detritus of the archive. Anthologies, of course, are collections of a sort. They contain disparate literary, musical, or artistic passages, works, or pieces and they are usually framed by an introduction. This frame, as Brent Edwards has argued, "flesh[es] out [the anthology's] history of use; and imagin[es] its scope of implication, its uses, its 'future.'"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Anthologies can often, as in the case of Alain Locke's <i>The New Negro </i>and certainly <i>The Norton Anthology of African American Literature,</i> institute a group of writers as canonical and envision a future in which the national assimilation of the "Negro" occurs. </p>

<p>Such was not the case with Cunard's <i>Negro. </i>It was banned in the British West Indies and several West African colonies on the grounds of its "seditiousness," and it prompted reactions from black activists and writers ranging from silence, to guarded 

<b></b>

praise, to great enthusiasm.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  What could not be denied about <i>Negro</i>'s achievement, however, was its articulation of a transnational African and African-diasporic world. <i>Negro </i>was certainly not the first text to do so. Elaborating a variety of political aims, W. E. B. Du Bois's <i>The Negro </i> and the<i> Crisis;</i> Marcus Garvey's <i>Negro World </i>and <i>Black Man</i>; and other Anglophone black periodicals such as the <i>New York Age, </i>the London-based the<i> Keys, </i>and Dus&#x00E9; Mohamed Ali's the<i> Ethiopian Times and Orient Review</i>; and Francophone journals such as <i>La D&#x00E9;p&#x00EA;che africaine</i> and<i> La Revue du monde noir </i>aimed at creating transnational solidarities. (I am using the term transnationalism rather than internationalism to denote how colonization and the slave trade created nation states composed of multinational populations who are situated both within and without a given territorially-bound nation.)<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Yet Cunard's <i>Negro Anthology </i>far outstripped previous efforts to document the formidable history and cultures of black people around the world. </p>

<p><i>Negro</i>'s transnational effort has, by and large, been obscured by critical attention to Cunard's racial romanticism and her refusal to acknowledge her race and class privilege as a white vanguard poet and activist.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In fact, <i>Negro </i>is now a nearly forgotten anthology. Besides objection to Cunard herself, <i>Negro</i>'s idiosyncratic collection of documents of African and African-diasporic experience&#x2014;including accounts of the middle passage, slavery, segregation, lynching, rape, forced labor and hunger as well as black artistic, historical and cultural achievements&#x2014;has recently been read as a "personal and anecdotal [rather] than global collection."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  I suggest, however, that <i>Negro </i>can be understood as recontextualizing white avant-gardist and socialist rupture within an African and African-diasporic modernity. The anthology combines a historical reconstruction of African and African-diasporic pasts with the revolutionary impulses documented by <i>Negro</i>'s communist and surrealist-inspired contributions, especially its manifestos and montage forms. In addition, reading <i>Negro</i> as a transnational modernist text articulated (at least in part) from the perspective of colonized and subject peoples of color makes modernism look less like a radical break with the past than a disjunctive crossing of past, present, and future, a crossing that expresses the condition of black modernity. </p>

<p>This reading undoubtedly goes against the grain of Cunard's primitivist intentions when examined by themselves. But I propose that we read <i>Negro</i> as a collectivist documentary project within whose revisionary context of colonial and racialized "peripheries" and "prehistories" its revolutionary contributions should be understood. In the case of <i>Negro, </i>I am investigating how avant-garde rupture meets the occulted history of African and African-diasporic modernity and how it intervenes in the racialized ground of Anglo-European modernism by making visible the constitutive function of racial difference. This manner of reading transnationally demonstrates how <i>Negro</i> sutures African and African-diasporic experience together&#x2014;its linguistic diversity, its generic fluidity, its wide-ranging and fragmented international and historical scope&#x2014;to expose its gaps and contradictions. These gaps might be considered as symptoms of transnationalism, its differences in unity, rather than as its flaws.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  I see <i>Negro </i>as a fringe document, a border-crossing hybrid that has been historically overlooked as a signal articulation of the uneven race relations of the 1930s: situated as it is between the anti-imperialist&#x2014;yet 

<b></b>

often racially hierarchical&#x2014;initiatives of white cosmopolitanism and an increasingly powerful and organized black transnationalism. <i>Negro </i>is a document of war against imperialism and capitalism. It does not deconstruct the color line, but rather seeks to make clear the stakes involved for the underdeveloped world in a situation of on-going capitalist development and bourgeois forms of nationalism.  </p>

<p>At first glance, <i>Negro </i>does indeed appear to be a byproduct of modernist cosmopolitanism, offering from the standpoint of European universalism a collection of artifacts from "primitive" and "modern" cultures.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The anthology&#x2014;with its 200 entries by some 150 contributors (two-thirds of whom were black) and 385 illustrations&#x2014;contains poetry, manifestos, history, ethnography, photographs, and rant. It traverses Europe, the United States, South America, the West Indies, and Africa, and includes hate mail, a confidential French military circular, advertisements, French children's comics, folk songs and scores, ethnographic maps, and reproductions of African art. Its contributors include Zora Neale Hurston, Theodore Dreiser, W. E. B. Du Bois, Michael Gold, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Arturo Schomburg and includes poetry by Arna Bontemps, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Sterling Brown, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Alfred Kreymborg and Louis Zukofsky, to speak only of the American portion of the anthology. Its international contributors included Jomo Kenyatta, T. K. Utchay, Ben N. Azikiwe, the Cuban poet Nichol&#x00E1;s Guilli&#x00E9;n, the Haitian poet Jacques Roumain, the Brazilian <i>modernismo</i> Mario de Andrade, George Padmore, Raymond Michelet, translations by Samuel Beckett, contributions by Richard Aldington, surrealists Andr&#x00E9; Breton, Ren&#x00E9; Crevel, Ren&#x00E9; Char, Benjamin Peret, Yves Tanguy, Pierre Unik, Paul Eluard, Roger Callois, the South African writers William Plomer and Beatrice Hastings and many others. In many ways, <i>Negro </i>testifies to Cunard's mobility and access to circles of all sorts as a privileged cosmopolitan subject. It also gives evidence of the growing numbers of colonial elites at home in major metropolitan centers, if not necessarily the world.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Cunard gathered material for the anthology between two transatlantic trips to the United States and the Caribbean. The anthology was made in New York, Paris, and London where Cunard solicited contributions from members of avant-garde, scholarly, modernist, communist, pan-Africanist and black entertainment circles.  </p>

<p>The occluded significance of Cunard's <i>Negro</i> in accounts of modernism stems, in part, from the sheer critical difficulty of accounting for its disparities and contradictions: between its editorial endorsement of a programmatic communism and its contributions of sober historical scholarship, and between detailing the horrors of colonization and racism and its jubilant and often primitivist celebration of popular black entertainers, folk art, and African arts.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Michael North contends that the anthology's "episodic nature" creates "a weirdly dissociative effect," one that positions blacks within a rigid dichotomy as either "objects of pity or comedy."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  But far more than a rigid dichotomy, the anthology aims at a "panorama" of black struggles and achievements against a racist modernity. While Cunard's intent, at times, is "no less than a comprehensive history of the cultural, social, political, and artistic achievements of the black people of the world" (HRC), what surrealist Georges Sadoul called "une v&#x00E9;ritable encyclop&#x00E9;die de la question n&#x00E8;gre," at others, her aim is much more provisional.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  <i>Negro </i>is not, Cunard claims, "a <i>literary </i>anthology," but rather, it aspires to achieve a certain <i>method</i> of accounting

<b></b>

 for race. <i>Negro, </i>as Cunard wrote to Claude McKay, is "a very large symposium indeed with a definite and clearly defined intent: to throw light on the appalling way the entire colour 'question' is handled" (Cunard to McKay, 28 January 1932, HRC). Its method&#x2014;demonstrated by Cunard's manic accumulation of documents and photos of black experience and racism&#x2014;can be compared to surrealist ethnography, with its found objects and recognition of the occult practices of everyday life. <i>Negro</i> collects the scraps and ephemera of black expressive life in order to patch together a history&#x2014;combined with the revolutionary energy of vanguard communism&#x2014;that can transform the present.  </p>

<p>That Cunard became all-consumed by her documentary project might be understood as a desire for another kind of life that entailed an abnegation of self. The "prismatic fringes" of the library, as Benjamin suggests above, operate through desire: one becomes "attached" to sundry periodicals, leaflets, manuscript copies, and other scraps of the past. Even after the anthology was published, Cunard obsessively added to it, cramming her battered, torn copy of <i>Negro </i>with more newspaper clippings and notes (<i>HDF</i>, xi). Her desire for an alternative world registered itself through a frenzied accumulation of "stuff" about the Negro. In so doing, Cunard sought to escape the privileged claustrophobia of her background through an identification with black diasporic and African cultures.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
The Collector
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Walter Benjamin argues that a collection tells more about the collector than about the objects themselves (<i>IL</i>, 59). The collector attempts to reconstruct a past that is lost in order to give meaning to his or her own sense of haphazardness in the present. A collector's mania reveals an excessive disorder, a "whimsicality" and arbitrariness, that serves as "the scene" and "the stage" in and on which to perform the fate of their objects, their final appropriation by the owner: "The period, the region, the craftsmanship, the former ownership&#x2014;for a true collector the whole background of an item adds up to a magic encyclopedia whose quintessence is the fate of his object" (<i>IL</i>, 60). The encyclopedic quality of a collection suggests a comprehensive yet contingent quality, marking a vanished past and attempting to fill in the present with found scraps of that hidden past. The collection provides a materialist history of the present, a collage that depends on the recontextualization and revision of a hidden past in order to construct a new kind of future.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  It fills in the present moment through reference to a vanished or nostalgic past that, if recontextualized and recirculated, might compose an alternative future to the ever-changing sameness under capitalism. One can witness this desire for an alternative to race relations and life more generally under capitalism in Cunard's paean to Harlem in <i>Negro, </i>"Harlem Reviewed": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Notice how many of the whites are unreal in America; they are <i>dim</i>. But the Negro is very real; he is <i>there</i>. And the ofays [whites] know it. That's why they come to Harlem&#x2014;out of curiosity and jealousy and don't-know-why. This desire to get close to the other race has often nothing honest about it. . . . This [spectacle of Negroes entertaining whites] 

<b></b>

applies of course to the mass of whites who treat Harlem in the same way that English toffs used to talk about 'going slumming.' The class I'm thinking of is 'the club-man.' They want entertainment.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In place of entertainment, Cunard finds the "restless, desire, brooding" of Harlem. She praises its nostalgia that articulates a "gorgeous roughness" composed of people in the street, their language and dress, and "the eternal radio seeping through everything day and night" (<i>N</i>, 73). In short, she discovers in black expressive culture the material and affective means of embracing an alternative class- and race-based relationship to modernity. Though primitivist, it provides both an imaginative and real means of rejecting bourgeois culture. </p>

<p>Cunard's scandalous desire for the "Negro" puts herself, as collector, into the picture. She crosses the boundary between bohemian slumming and something entirely else. Her intensely personal but very public rupture with her mother, for instance, that occasioned the 1931 pamphlet "Black Man and White Ladyship: an anniversary," broke the taboo of privacy by publicly exposing her mother's Anglo-American bigotry and hypocrisy. She combined matriphobia with radical politics to repudiate her class and race privilege, advocate racial justice, and critique British imperialism.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  In the pamphlet, distributed to all of Cunard's friends and family (and a portion of it published in the<i> Crisis</i>), she refers to the Colour Question "with its CLASH or SHOCK aspect" as it generates hysteria in her mother (pamphlet, HRC, 1). Cunard writes, "she does not mind the Negroes now artistically or in an <i>abstract </i>sense but . . . oh, that terrible colour! (I invite Her Ladyship to send in writing a short definition of a Negro in the <i>abstract </i>sense)" (pamphlet, HRC, 3). Cunard's strategy against racism is to generate written commentary on "Colour." By documenting and collecting its material manifestation, she aims to concretize and show the lie of "race." </p>

<p>In a similar collecting fashion, her response to the press scandal that erupted while she was in Harlem gathering material for <i>Negro</i> was to invite the public to comment on why it was that Americans could not deal with race. On May 2, 1932, the New York <i>Daily Mirror </i>printed a story suggesting that Nancy Cunard came to Harlem to seduce Paul Robeson who was staying at the same hotel as she. Both Cunard and Robeson denied the story by telegram and when the story refused to die out, Cunard called a press conference. After discussing the purpose of her visit to Harlem, she asked:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>And now after your interest in my private affairs (I hope I have sufficiently satisfied this) I want something in return. [. . .] <i>Why are you Americans so uneasy of the Negro race? </i>This question is the epitome of the whole colour question as it strikes a plain English person such as myself. Who'll write me the best answer to this? I'll print it in my book on Colour.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Eventually Cunard was forced to go into hiding on an upstate farm to escape constant press harassment. But in response to her query, she received approximately five hundred letters, among which two or three dozen contained obscenities and threats of abduction and violence. These letters, some of which Cunard reprinted in <i>Negro, </i>suggest the gender and sexual meanings read into her transgressive interest in "Negroes":

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I don't know what they call your kind in England but here in America they call them plain nigger fuckers or prostitutes of the lowest kind . . .</p>
<p>You dirty lowdown cocksucker, you are trying to convince the white race of NYC that you came here to write a book about the negro race, we know that you came here to suck the black pricks . . .</p>
<p>I feel certain that in the eyes of this world of white humanity, you Miss Nancy Cunard, are lower, [<i>sic</i>] than the lowest of prostitutes, in your phoney outbursts, and belley-hoo [<i>sic</i>] you are making since your arrival to this country. If you for one moment think that you are fooling the US people with your book writing pretext, you are mistaken . . . <sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">To be fair, Cunard also printed supportive letters by whites, including Southerners, thanking her for her work. But lest one thinks that Cunard's boundary crossing was a species of pure pleasure-mongering voyeurism, these letters alone testify to the political and social stakes of her work. In fact, Cunard received the fifteen hundred pounds needed to print one thousand copies of her anthology by Wishart and Co. in London through the proceeds of a successful libel trial conducted in England for the outraged accusations circulating in the British press over the alleged affair. (No damages were collected from the United States press). Literally, then, the anthology rests on the scandal of interracial desire.  </p>

<p>Cunard herself commented very little on the gender implications of the scandal. For her, the "sex scandal" is merely an effort to detract from antiracist work: "any interest manifested by a white person, even a foreigner to America (such as myself), is immediately transformed into a sex 'scandal'" (<i>N</i>, 197). She explains, "No chance is ever missed by the American press, and the type of American that believes it (vastly preponderant), to stir up as much fury as possible against Negroes and their white friends. To do this the sex motive is always used. As in the South it is always the lie of the 'rape' of white women by black men, so in the North it is always the so-called 'scandal' of inter-racial relations" (<i>N</i>, 197, see also <i>CL</i>, 86). Cunard extends the implications of the Scottsboro Case, perhaps following Ida B. Wells-Barnett's lead, to an analysis of how gender relations support race and class divisions wherever color and class lines exist, not merely in the South.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Black Transnationalism
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Cunard's initial interest in race and class politics stemmed, in part, from her affiliation with surrealism and communism. Both groups in the early 1930s concerned themselves with anticolonial and antiracist struggles in order to contest colonization. The "elsewhere" they envisioned offered a disjunctive and space-clearing gesture through which, in <i>Negro</i>, a black revolutionary tradition could emerge within the interstices of white cosmopolitanism.  </p>

<p>The format of the anthology borrows from surrealist ethnography, a practice that displayed the irrationality of the primitive, the unconscious, and the mad. For surrealists, 

<b></b>

African and Oceanic artifacts, in particular, represented the farthest limits of human sensibility. Through encounters with the primitive, surrealism sought freedom from oppressive social constraints and freedom to imagine and enact the future differently. The juxtaposition between civilized and savage contested European taxonomies and hierarchies of value. Consider Cunard's 1931 plan for the anthology which promised to contain:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>1) The contemporary Negro in America, S. America, West Indies, Europe (writers, painters, musicians, and other artists and personalities). With photographs. 2) Musical section. Last century and modern American Negro compositions (Spirituals, Jazz, Blues, etc.)&#x2014;Reproduced. As much African tribal music as obtainable&#x2014;Reproduced. . . . 3) African. Ethnographical.

Reproductions of Colored Advertisements. . . . </p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Cunard's juxtaposition of celebrities, musical scores, African art, political and sociological analysis, poetry, and racist memorabilia lacks an overarching narrative. Like a scrapbook, it relies on the juxtaposition of many unrelated or loosely related materials. Similarly, surrealist ethnography uses montage-effects to defamiliarize everyday life and reveal unconscious taboos. In the technique of montage, contradictory materials (whether visual or verbal) are placed side by side and left unreconciled. There is no hierarchizing of significance. As a result, no one perspective can be said to dominate the others. The revolutionary energies provoked by surrealist techniques are not channeled into any authorizing practice but instead engage the reader to see the whole, including the gaps where difference exists without reconciliation and where translation produces misrecognition and the uncanny. It becomes an open-ended system. There is no subordination of one perspective into a single dominant perspective.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Walter Benjamin, who was influenced by surrealist techniques, said that montage had "special, perhaps even total rights" as a progressive form because it "interrupts the context into which it is inserted."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  It lacks a unifying argument and instead threatens to burst the confines of any form and normalizing context.  </p>

<p>But more than merely deconstructing European modernity, surrealist ethnography began to move away from primitivism <i>tout court </i>towards an affiliation with anticolonial and workers' movements. The relation between surrealism and communism in the service of African and African-diasporic history is a fascinating conjunction between avant-garde aesthetic practices and global anti-imperialism. Communism in the 1920s and early 1930s explicitly promoted a doctrine of anti-imperialism. But by 1935, the Communist Party made antifascist initiatives their focus and let anti-imperialist concerns dwindle in importance. However, their backing of anti-imperialist organizations before 1935 was groundbreaking. For instance, they supported anti-imperialist proposals within colonizing countries. The Resolution of the Communist International on the "Negro Question in the United States," cited in <i>Negro,</i> declared that "these social 

<b></b>

antagonisms [the remnants of slavery] stink of the disgusting atmosphere of the old slave market. This is downright robbery and slave-whipping barbarism at the peak of capitalist 'culture'" (<i>N</i>, 229).  </p>

<p>The Communist International also organized worldwide conferences of African leaders. It recognized the successes of the Universal Negro Improvement Association under Marcus Garvey as well as the Pan-African Congresses organized by W. E. B. Du Bois. One of its international conferences, held in Brussels in 1927, included future nationalist leaders Jomo Kenyatta (a contributor to <i>Negro</i>) and Jawaharlal Nehru. The Congress made important steps in coordinating various struggles for national liberation in the colonies and passed a resolution that proclaimed, "Africa for the Africans, and their full freedom and equality with other races and the right to govern Africa."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The Comintern's resolutions regarding the right to self-determination of black peoples, including those in the Southern United States and South Africa, affirmed that "Black people had their own unique revolutionary tradition" (<i>HPR</i>, 107).  </p>

<p>This pronouncement, of course, was <i>not</i> news to black people. Prior to, but also mobilized through this affirmation, African and African-diasporic writers had recovered a worldwide black revolutionary tradition within modernity, but distinct from European traditions. Brent Edwards defines this tradition as both transnational and  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>molded through attempts to appropriate and transform the discourses of internationalism . . . the discourse of international civil society as embodied by the League of Nations, the counter-universalism of proletarian revolution envisioned by the Communist International, and the globe-carving discourse of European colonialism. </p>

<p class="continued">Drawing its ideas from pan-Africanist and communist anti-imperialism, black transnationalism borrowed, to varying extents, from communism, European liberalism, and black vernacular traditions. Contributors to <i>Negro </i>such as George Padmore, James W. Ford, and W. E. B. Du Bois affirmed a long history of black resistance, from Toussaint L'Ouverture in Haiti to Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey, and Gabriel Prosser in the United States and to the contemporary and controversial Haile Sellasie in Ethiopia. And contributors recovered the history of African civilizations, the slave trade, and slave resistance articulated in and against white-defined modernity. This recovery of black history and cultures had enormous impact on the transvaluation of racial identities and was a significant element of <i>Negro</i>'s aims. Moreover, <i>Negro</i> united across cultural and linguistic barriers a worldwide racial identity, a move that somewhat opened the idea of "race" to historical and geographical contingency without necessarily challenging racial difference itself. <i>Negro </i>articulated the underside of global imperialism, the experience of multiple local histories interwoven into a provisional and transnational identity, that of the Negro. For instance, Gordon O. Bell, in an article in <i>Negro</i> entitled "The Negro in Barbados," indicates the instability and incommensurability of the term "Negro":  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is a definite dissimilarity between the American and the West Indian interpretation of the term "Negro." In America the definition is universally applied to those persons who are not 100 per cent. white; in the West Indies it is apparently reserved for those who are 

<b></b>

100 per cent. black. Indeed it is noticeable that in the society of people of Negro descent the word seems taboo, and is religiously eschewed, the term "colored" being used to classify the multiplicity of shades existing between the pure white and the pure black. To call the average colored West Indian a Negro is to affront him . . . </p>

<p class="continued">Reading across the discontinuities of diasporic and African locations in <i>Negro</i>&#x2014;from the Congo, South Africa, Liberia, Kenya, West Africa, Uruguay, Brazil, British Guiana, Trinidad, Cuba, Grenada, Jamaica, Haiti, Europe and the United States&#x2014;produces a pragmatics of race that is performative. That is, these racial identities are not prelinguistic givens; rather, they are citations of previous scripts. <i>Negro</i>'s boundaries and meanings are contingent and contested rather than, as often occurs in nationalist formations, metaphysical and fixed. The anthology requires that readers move between multiple temporalities (the old in the new) and between multiple locations and perspectives, including racist attitudes and European cosmopolitanism. This reading practice is mobile, improvisational, openended, and importantly critiques the racial ground of the modern to which I shall return below.  </p>

<p>But do these historical perspectives eliminate the colonizing dangers of cosmopolitanism? In <i>Negro, </i>Cunard's cosmopolitan perspective and interests infuse the anthology. Her editorial comments are interspersed among contributions, hierarchizing the interpretation of its contents despite the anthology's montage form. (For instance, Du Bois's affiliation with the NAACP is condemned for catering to the bourgeois class.) Many of the white contributors (William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Robert Goffin) universalize their point of view, relegating Negroes to objects of history. In the Africa section, Cunard displays her bracelet collection to which she adds a contextualizing caption that discusses the significance of the bracelets for Ibo women in Nigeria: "With the older women these ivories are priceless treasures, and they will endure any hardships in preference to degrading themselves by selling them, however great the inducement may be" (<i>N</i>, 731). Cunard's caption alludes to the suffering that allowed these bracelets to come into her possession. Is she indifferent or unaware of the irony of this? Or perhaps she attempted to exorcise this past when she staged her infamous bondage photos in which the primitive beads she wears threaten to choke her (<a href="#1"> 1</a>).

<p class="continued">If one considers <i>Negro</i>'s documentary project as a whole, its aim is clearly to make visible exactly this sort of suffering in order to foster anti-imperialist and antiracist sentiments and action. The scale of one's interpretation defines how to judge <i>Negro</i>. The anthology,

<b></b>

 as Cunard envisioned it, was to be a "symposium" for the ways in which "colour" is handled. The anthology frames "race"&#x2014;here I borrow from George Hutchinson's analysis of <i>The New Negro </i>anthology&#x2014;as "a field of commerce and conflict."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Dismissing the most flagrant aspect of this conflict, critical appraisals of <i>Negro</i> tend to downplay Cunard's communist pronouncements (cf. <i>HDF, PD</i>). These appraisals are in part correct given that Cunard was never politically active in the Communist Party or in any other political organization. Nonetheless, Cunard draws on communism as a unifying and militant force that rejects capitalist universalism and promises social and political equality for blacks. In the preface to <i>Negro, </i>Cunard proclaims that "The Communist world-order is the solution of the race problem for the Negro" and she praises the virtues of the Soviet Union and its race relations (<i>N</i>, iii). It has, she confidently asserts, "once and for all solved the 'problem' of races, turning instilled conflicts into co-operation, wiping out the false concept of 'inferiority'" (<i>N</i>, iv). In one contribution to <i>Negro, </i>for example, surrealist Georges Sadoul compares French and Soviet children's cartoons in order to show French imperial versus Soviet egalitarian (though paternalist) race relations (<i>N</i>, 573).

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>For my purposes, far more important than speculations about what the Soviet Union may have accomplished (and did not) in terms of race relations, is the appeal of revolutionary rupture to open the present moment to alternative visions and possibilities outside of European cosmopolitanism. Cunard's preface concludes with a call, "The White Man is Killing Africa!" She elaborates, "I have ended it [the Anthology] on this <i>note, </i>for the chord of oppression, struggle and protest rings, trumpet-like or muffled, but always insistent throughout" (<i>N</i>, iv). The chord, collective, often dissonant, strikes one note and is held "throughout," extending the present moment to reconceptions of history. In this revisioning of history through recourse to an "elsewhere," avant-garde rupture shares affinities with the discontinuous history of the black diaspora.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The alternative history of transnational affiliation that is articulated through revolutionary rupture gives rise to a new politics of reading, one that interrupts cosmopolitan appropriation of other cultures by means of an alternative tradition of resistance. This note might, at first glance, appear to participate in an imperialist nostalgia, what Caren Kaplan describes as a remorse for the cultures and environments being destroyed by modernity even while continuing the same practices.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  But even as Cunard romanticizes the vanishing African- and African-diasporic ways of life, she refuses European modernity that colonizes these cultures and argues instead for an alternative modernity based on black transnationalism. <i>Negro</i>'s exhaustive statistical documentation of atrocities committed by Europeans across the African continent<i>&#x2014;</i>of the division and theft of land, onerous taxation, forced labor in which workers die of hunger and exhaustion, the conscription of African soldiers to European armies, police and judicial repression, genocide, the decimation of traditions&#x2014;views the history of Western political thought and practice through the perspective of Africa, its constitutive outside.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Cunard's rejection of capitalist modernity operated in the best traditions of avant-garde modernism. She recalled "the indignation, the fury, the disgust, the contempt, the longing to t" over the color bar and all it stood for that motivated <i>Negro </i>(1964 letter to Hugh Ford HRHRC). Rejecting the historical present that created the segregation and class oppression of black people, she presents her anthology as a founding moment of modernism. Her 1931 circular, which announces the formation of a book on Colour (<i>Negro</i>'s first title), asks for "outspoken criticism." She envisions the collection as an antibourgeois gesture and promises that this will be "the first time such a book has been compiled in this manner. It is primarily for Coloured people and it is dedicated to one of them. I wish by their aid to make it as inclusive as possible" (HRC). By all estimations, Cunard successfully published what all anthologies are: events. They make history by their very publication and they repeat other histories as they script their intervention. (As indicated earlier, however, the critical reception of an anthology conditions the extent to which that history is made or forgotten.) Cunard's call for contributions, written in 1931, produces a scaffolding of future expectations of what the anthology will be. She proclaims: "I want outspoken criticism, comment and comparison from the Negro on the present-day civilisations of Europe, American, South America, the West Indies, African Colonies, etc. . . . individual documents, letters, photographs from those that have travelled and can judge of the attitude of diverse countries and races" (HRC). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>This founding moment of the anthology has prompted literary scholars to call this circular a manifesto.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  It presents a prefatory explanation of new art and literature by an emergent group. The anthology becomes the realization of the manifesto. As in typical modernist ruptures, other anthologies (such as <i>The New Negro </i>and <i>Fire!!</i>) are by default declared superseded in favor of the "new" anthology. Cunard announces that the anthology will be "the first" of its kind and originary in scope. Indeed, the scope of <i>Negro</i>, with its painful, unsettling documentation of forced labor, chain gangs, the middle passage, slave resistance, lynching, and poverty enacts what Neil Lazarus has called modernism's absolute refusal to accommodate itself to modernity as it exists: "what at least some modernist work has done from the outset: namely, says 'no'; refuses integration, resolution, consolation, comfort; [it] protests and criticizes."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Modernism's refusal to cooperate with bourgeois modernity finds its critical and historical edge in <i>Negro</i>.  </p>

<p>The energy of rupture functions as a space-clearing gesture that allows modernity to be revised through an African and African diasporic perspective. In order to contextualize and revise Negro identity, the ground of white liberalism needed to be excavated as well. Some contributors to <i>Negro </i>subjected the contradictions and hypocrisies of a universalized European history to critical scrutiny. For example, the surrealist manifesto in <i>Negro</i>, "Murderous Humanitarianism," signed by Andr&#x00E9; Breton, Roger Caillois, Pierre Unik, Benjamin P&#x00E9;ret, Ren&#x00E9; Char, Ren&#x00E9; Crevel, Paul Eluard, Martiniquans J. M. Monnerot, and Pierre Yoyotte, targets "counterfeit liberalism" with its notions of progress: "It is no good blustering about the Antilles and the 'happy evolution' that has enabled them [blacks of the Antilles] to be assimilated, or very nearly, by France" (<i>N</i>, 574). In place of such ameliorism, the surrealists declare "<i>Revolution first and always</i>" (<i>N</i>, 574). This break from continuous, reformist discourse for the surrealists occurs not simply by ushering in the "new" but by staging a confrontation between the familiarity with France and its strange territories with which it is more than ever closely entwined. Rather than using the colonies and colonial display to normalize European modernity (as did, for instance, the International Colonial Exhibition of Paris, held in 1931), the surrealists confronted European narcissistic self-satisfactions. They did this much as they organized their exhibit protesting the Colonial Exhibition, called "The Truth about the Colonies." In "The Truth about the Colonies" the surrealists articulated a crisis of modernity as they punctured the smooth unfolding of modern time with the assemblages of tribal objects, polemical graphics, and Western religious objects resignified as the fetishized ritual artifacts of Catholicism.  </p>

<p>The surrealist manifesto also displaces the spatial and temporal ordering of modernity to bring the shock of anticolonial war to France. They announce: "We Surrealists pronounced ourselves [in response to the 1925 French war against Morocco] in favour of changing the imperialist war, in its chronic and colonial form, into a civil war" (<i>N</i>, 574). This civil war interrupts self-glorification and self-identity. Describing France as "hideously inflated from having dismembered Europe, made mincemeat of Africa, polluted Oceania and ravaged whole tracts of Africa," the surrealists reject an abstract universal (France as harbinger of liberty, equality, and fraternity) and instead make concrete a gluttonous, butchering France "hideously inflated" and morally corrupt&#x2014;descriptions 

<b></b>

that match those often used to describe the colonial "problem" (<i>N</i>, 574). The terrain of the world is cannibalized by France. The surrealists' revision of national mythology attempts to alter narratives of modernity where civilized men travel to savage territories. Similarly, their strategy in the "Truth about the Colonies" Exhibit contests the colonial order of things through the montage of tribal and modern artifacts. </p>

<p>The moment's urgency in the manifesto is underscored by a photograph of a "Colonial Negro tailor in a small factory in France" (<i>N</i>, 575). This shot is still and dark; it gives a sense of waiting but its calm, smooth detachment also contrasts with the manic and barbaric excesses of France. It positions the "colonial negro" squarely in modernity (in the factory) and as a force of revolution. The photograph provides a sense of lived immediacy and contact with the physical presence of the colonial suffering in the center of empire. Yet inscribed as a photographic image, he speaks of a present moment lost forever. The unfulfilled need for redemption might potentially be altered in the present moment of revolutionary change. The present is pregnant with anticipated change, thickened but also haunted by a past of unredeemed suffering. Lived experience expands to take in the waiting of the black proletariat and the expectation that modernity will arise from that location, as the manifesto states, as a "torrent of those energies . . . will close over [the Frenchman's] head" (<i>N</i>, 575). Benjamin, in his essay on surrealism, locates revolutionary potential in what might otherwise appear to be the detritus of modernity. I suggest that the surrealists aimed at targeting this potential in the contingent photo of the black worker. Benjamin writes: "Only when in technology body and image so interpenetrate that all revolutionary tension becomes bodily collective innervation, and all the bodily innervations of the collective become revolutionary discharge, has reality transcended itself to the extent demanded by <i>The Communist Manifesto.</i>"<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  While these beliefs in the revolutionary potential of the Negro may be romanticized&#x2014;the Negro is believed to be elsewhere&#x2014;and thus surrealism participates in an exoticized primitivism, there is also the uncanny presence of the familiar and ordinary in the photograph. Subjects such as the black tailor might be said to dream a future revolution that never came, what Langston Hughes calls "dreams deferred" or Michael Hanchard calls a "futures past" in need of redemption.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The lost present becomes an aspect of the future anterior, a past event whose promise can only be fulfilled in the future and which renders the present incomplete. </p>

<p>The archival materials in <i>Negro</i> generate such revolutionary discharge by transforming the historical constraints of global capitalism that position black workers into slave-wage jobs into a discontinuous but unified worldwide anti-imperialist force. This force includes those forgotten in the past. <i>Negro </i>contains many references to these occluded subjects. In John L. Spivak's essay in <i>Negro, </i>"Flashes from Georgia Chain Gangs," he scours the files of the Georgia prison system: "the pathetic letters from convicts complaining of cruelty and barbarity, the doctors' reports on sickness and injuries and deaths, the punishment reports&#x2014;those little slips of paper gathering dust that told the stories of hopeless lives" (<i>N</i>, 211). Letters such as this one from Eugene Brown, sent from Gwinnett County on May 2, 1931:

<p class="continued">This latent possibility haunts the still image of the black tailor and the desperate appeal of Eugene Brown in the Georgia chain gang. The patchwork assemblage of <i>Negro</i> articulates nostalgia, and loss as well as revolutionary resistance.  </p>

<p>One can still point to the revolutionary romanticism of surrealist readings of the black proletariat. They impute to the "negro" tailor a subversive intent merely because he is marginal. But the same cannot be said of the manifesto reprinted in the "Africa" section of <i>Negro. </i>It circulated in the Belgian Congo and takes the form of Engel's early version of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, that of catechism or dialogue, between a na&#x00EF;ve worker and a politicized organizer. For instance, the first question "<i>What is a Negro?</i>" is answered: "A Negro is a man like any other, whose skin is black as the skin of Europeans is white and that of Arabs is brown" (<i>N</i>, 794). Race is a particularity that fails to negate the universality of the Negro subject as a "man." The next question is: "<i>Are Negroes treated like men in the Congo?</i>' 'No, in the Congo Negroes are treated as beasts and often worse than beasts.' '<i>Give an example of this</i>.' 'A dog can go into a white man's caf&#x00E9;, club, cinema, or house. A Negro cannot," (<i>N</i>, 794). A crucial difference between the surrealist and Belgian Congo manifestos is one of uneven development in modernity, the need to simultaneously critique modernity and nation-building in one location, France, and embrace it in the Congo. In the 1931 surrealist manifesto "First Appraisal of the Colonial Exhibition," the surrealists state that "just as the opponents of nationalism have the duty to defend the nationalism of oppressed peoples, so the opponents of that art which is the fruit of capitalist economy also have the duty to place the arts of oppressed people dialectically in opposition to it."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  In an engagement with Marxist thought as a solution to the problem of colonization, the 

<b></b>

black/white or first/third world divide is baldly dialectical. The contradictions are not deconstructed, at least not until synthesis becomes possible. Instead, the surrealists embrace the paradox of being against one form of social organization, nationalism, for their own location and supportive of it for the colonies. The Congo manifesto, too, demands nation-building and an increased engagement with modernity. It lists workers', soldiers', and villagers' demands:  </p>

<p class="continued">The manifesto demands action to build a practical consciousness of a black revolution under way. It does this by exposing the contradictions of imperialism and directing action towards the means of achieving unity, rights, and sovereignty. The Congo manifesto incorporates Marxist demands for better labor conditions with human rights and Kimbanguism, an indigenous millenarian religious movement led by Simon Kimbangu. Kimbangu combined Protestantism with ancient Congo ideas concerning the organization of the universe and urged against witchcraft and magic and for the restoration of moral order. He miraculously healed the sick and dying and preached anticolonialism. Arrested in September 1921 for subversion, he died in prison thirty years later, yet the church he founded thrives today in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  </p>

<i>Negro </i>and the Racial Ground of the Modern
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>This final section explores further the notion of uneven temporalities in <i>Negro. </i>It considers how black modernity is articulated within the amorphous, discontinuous materials of the anthology. Theodore Mason calls the publication of anthologies of underrepresented peoples, "both text and event," a literary production carrying extra literary weight that makes visible the process by which a community "represent[s] and codif[ies] in a formal way the history of its own expressivity."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The intention of the anthology, Cunard claims, is to speak from within and to a newly visible collective 

<b></b>

("coloured people") who announce their presence and engagement in modernity. This effort is necessarily belated given that modernity has long been articulated as a European-centered phenomena. This very belatedness then becomes performative, a reiteration of previous scripts. The time lag of modernity indicates modernity in all its global complexity, the articulations "structured in dominance" that comprise modernity.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  <i>Negro,</i> as Brent Edwards has argued, articulates "over and over again" the link "between politics and performance" (<i>PD</i>, 317). And, so, I wish to think of <i>Negro </i>in light of its performative effects articulated through the lens of black modernity. Its performativity opens historicism to overlooked histories of blacks in the New World, biographies of uncanonized black authors, and subaltern experiences within the imperial center (the U.S., Britain and France) and throughout the black Atlantic and Africa. <i>Negro </i>testifies to the way in which avant-garde rupture can open the present moment to the forgotten histories and peoples disavowed but present in modernity. These forgotten histories critique European-centered modernity as they present alternative forms of black modernism.  </p>

<p>This politics of reading is not straightforward. Rather, it is angled, asymmetrical, and refracted through black relations to the white world. Consider Alain Locke's congratulations to Cunard on the publication of her anthology: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . I congratulate you,&#x2014;almost enviously, on the finest anthology in every sense of the word ever compiled on the Negro. When I saw the announcements, I feared a scrap book, but by a miracle of arrangement, you have built up a unity of effect and a subtle accumulative force of enlightenment that is beyond all contradiction and evasion. </p>

<p class="continued">Rather than the unwieldy failure ("a scrap book") that <i>Negro</i> is often taken for, Locke emphasizes "unity of effect," a delayed force that achieves its ends through the slow, "subtle" prism of black modernity. Here, the term "scrap book" might mean a collection of unrelated fragments, but Locke realized, as we might today, that these disparate pieces build a sense of unity in difference, a transnational allegiance against racism. Moreover, its "accumulative force" of meaning depends upon its readers' experiential encounter with it. Nowhere is this more evident in <i>Negro </i>than in its diverse musical scores (folk tunes like "Cricket Gills and Dried Barnabis," "Congo Songs," and "Negro protest songs") that demand its readers' participation to make meaning. One needs to "play" or "hum" <i>Negro. </i>By "arrangement," each article, photo, and poem contributes to a heterogeneous, fissured understanding of the black diaspora. Brent Edwards suggests a politics of reading diaspora as that which navigates the "break" modeled by <i>Negro</i>'s very difficulties and discontinuities. Reading across such discrepancies, he argues, negotiates the condition of the African diaspora, its demand for translations across modernity (<i>PD</i>, 13). And, I would add, that attention to occluded histories revises our concept of avant-garde rupture&#x2014;not as clean break from the past&#x2014;but rather, as a "reration of temporality" that opens the present moment to its radical incompleteness, its "time out of joint."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p><i>Negro</i> was deeply invested not only in breaking from narratives of Western progress and bourgeois complacency but in presenting an alternative history, that of color. This crossing and recrossing the expanse of modernity, I suggest, opens the present moment to a "future anterior." Aldon Nielsen glosses such temporality as follows:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In order for intellectuals of the African diaspora to posit New World Africans as progenitors of modernity, in order for us, now, to follow them in thinking of African peoples as not simply subjects encompassed by modernity but as active producers of the modern, we must have modernity already there before us, and this is why all such writings are haunted by a 'post-' and why all such histories must immediately be seen as revisionist.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This temporality, he adds, accounts for why African-American modernity is usually posited as a "counter" or "alternative" modernity that joins a singular modernity with a particularly disjunctive cultural crossing.  </p>

<p>Modernity must have already been in place in order for "us" to recognize its counterculture. Zora Neale Hurston, foregrounded prominently in <i>Negro, </i>affirms this temporality in her essay, "Characteristics of Negro Expression." She first acknowledges the Negro's belated position in narratives of modernity. She admits that the Negro is often said to be "lacking in originality," hence incapable of the "new" and of doing anything but mimicking the white man (<i>N</i>, 42). Then, Hurston spins this time lag around to make this mimicry constitutive of black modernity: "While [the Negro] lives and moves in the midst of a white civilisation, everything he touches is re-interpreted for his own use. He has modified the language, mode of food preparation, practice of medicine, and most certainly the religion of his new country, just as he adapted to suit himself the Sheik hair-cut made famous by Rudolph Valentino" (<i>N</i>, 43). This resignification actively constitutes black "experience" as different from everyday dominant modes of perception in modernity. It opens the present by bringing together fragments of discarded and overlooked materials&#x2014;remnants of black life: hieroglyphic language; active, emotive religious customs; and geographical/racial identification (a black man sporting a Sheik hair-cut). But rather than inscribing these remnants onto a premodern past, Hurston demands that they be understood as a confrontation of dominant narratives of modernity in the present moment.  </p>

<p>For instance, she asserts that Negro folklore is "not a thing of the past" but still in the making: "Its great variety shows the adaptation of the black man: nothing is too old or too new, domestic or foreign, high or low, for his use. God and the Devil are paired, and are treated no more reverently than Rockefeller and Ford" (<i>N</i>, 42). The bricoleur is detached from sacred narratives of nation, class, culture and religious cosmology. He resignifies these disparate fragments in new forms. The aesthetic aura (of detached, ritualistic art forms) disappears as Hurston positions black folk culture as an avant-garde undoing of modernity's empty, futile forms. What could be more modernist, capable of grasping the contingent and ephemeral, the exotic and the detritus of modernity, than a black painter of modern life?  </p>

<p>More than effecting a transvaluation of black culture, Hurston undermines the racialized ground of the modern. She demonstrates how black resignification has been 

<b></b>

adopted by white culture as the sign of the modern and repeated with a difference. As blacks adapt whites' musical instruments to their own ends, those modifications are adopted by the white man himself and then reinterpreted. Hurston glosses this dizzying exchange as follows: "Paul Whiteman is giving an imitation of a Negro orchestra making use of white-invented musical instruments in a Negro way" (<i>N</i>, 43). Hurston's <i>mise en abyme </i>of performing racial difference, as Michael North has noted, is more than turning the tables on white judgments of Negro mimicry. Rather, North says, </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>it is precisely because it [Negro art] is already imitative that it cannot be further imitated. It is precisely the self-conscious awareness, the ironic indirection, of black art and language that makes it original and impossible to mimic. White performers, because they are unself-conscious, na&#x00EF;ve, and obsessed with a false concept of originality, are helpless to rival the race they long to emulate.</p>

<p class="continued">While white modernity has long sought representations of blackness to affirm the modernism of their art, blacks have reinterpreted these representations of themselves, and so folded the linear temporality of the modern into a "post" within black modernity, a future anterior.  </p>

<p><i>Negro </i>dismantles the racial subtext of the modern from the opposite direction as well. The surrealist Ren&#x00E9; Crevel's surrogate essay, "The Negress in the Brothel," is omitted from the table of contents of <i>Negro.</i> Fearing censorship due to the explicit language and content in this essay, Cunard printed the essay separately through the Utopia Press in London and inserted it without page numbers into the anthology (its Roman numerals I, II, III mark the gap). It both literally and ratively articulates a gap between an erotic desire for interracial intimacy and how that desire is manifested within modernity's racial organization. It names within this overlooked location the repressed black female sexuality erased by Cunard's attention to white women's liaisons with black men. Crevel names the fetish of race as the enabling condition of modernism and locates its formative moment in Baudelaire's poetry: "<i>Charme inattendu d'un bijou rose et noir</i>: Baudelaire adores the dark flesh of Jeanne Duval" (<i>N</i>, II). The structure of this relationship, Crevel writes, is akin to "the Taylor system with division of labor [<i>sic</i>]" (<i>N</i>, II). </p>

<p>Moreover, the brothel and drawing room mutually constitute each other in modernity, the brothel compensating for the alienation attendant among stifling bourgeois society: "But even when for one reason or another [the Frenchman] is obliged to remain at home [rather than in the colonies] he demands to be entertained and debauched by the exotic curiosity that lifts him clear of the national fact into an illusion of renewal" (<i>N</i>, III). Interracial intimacy cannot be achieved in this scenario; it, too, is a product of the same forces that create modernity's abstractions of labor, exchange, and ideas, the Taylorization of work, and, here, of consumption. Modernity creates the spectacle of race, a "scenic organisation," in which the "object of desire has become an object in the d&#x00E9;cor of desires" (<i>N</i>, III). The black prostitute is seen indirectly, through a racial organization of society. The gutter, the inadmissible, the venal are inscribed onto the "erotic machinery" of Baudelaire's relationship with Jeanne Duval. As such, Crevel accuses

<b></b>

 Baudelaire of anticipating reprisals from critics who would depreciate his "liaison with this whore" and making fine poetry from the dilemma. The structure of sadism and superiority represented in this relationship demonstrate, he writes, a "hypocritical servility before things as they are" (<i>N</i>, II). This servility to the racial organization of modernity produces not only the means by which modernism constitutes itself in relation to alterity but also, Crevel will insist, that it contributes to the eroticized <i>mise en sc&#x00E8;ne</i> by which white audiences gaze at black entertainers: "Hence the popularity of Martinique jazz, Cuban melodies, Harlem bands and the entire tam-tam of the Colonial Exhibition" (<i>N</i>, III). White modernity, as it partakes of a racial obsession with alterity, realizes itself in commodified black entertainment.  </p>

<p>Puncturing this reified, sterile structure of white voyeurism of blacks, Hurston resignifies black performance as akin to the dandy in its self-as-spectacle.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Like Baudelaire's self-fashioning as fl&#x00E2;neur, which Benjamin calls "a publicity stunt" necessitated by the poet's "loss of halo," the dandy signals the cancelled distance of the aura. The disenchantment of art necessitates for Baudelaire an "exhibit of his own person <i>on the market</i>."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  So, too, black performance presents the commodification of self, a construction of black identity for white onlookers. Hurston asks her audience: "Who has not observed a robust young Negro chap posing upon a street corner, possessed of nothing but his clothing, his strength and his youth? Does he bear himself like a pauper? No, Louis XIV could be no more insolent in his assurance" (<i>N</i>, 39). Though Hurston likens the dandy to the French aristocracy in his coldness and pride of bearing, she domesticates him within a heteronormative structure of reproduction: this dandy has a female counterpart: "A Negro girl strolls past the corner lounger. Her whole body panging and posing. . . . A hippy undulation below the waist that is a sheaf of promises tied with conscious power. She is acting out 'I'm a darned sweet woman and you know it'" (<i>N</i>, 39). They betray what Baudelaire would call a "characteristic quality of opposition and revolt": that which is "finest in human pride, of that compelling need . . . of combating and destroying triviality." He calls this a "native energy," a "new kind of aristocracy," the "last spark of heroism amid decadence."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Effecting detachment through their self-creation, Hurston's black fl&#x00E2;neurs inject desire into a black modernity: "These little plays by strolling players are acted out daily in a dozen streets in a thousand cities, and no one ever mistakes the meaning" (<i>N</i>, 39).  </p>

<p>In narrating these scenes as performance, Hurston draws attention to their status as collective ritual. Negro expression, Hurston contends, is a communal art. It is an active constitution of the everyday as "experience," of intimacy blended with detachment that produces a conscious self-creation whose meaning will only be completed by the audience. Negro art, because its possibilities can only be realized through its "beholders," proves, in Hurston's estimation, their superiority in art from whites. She explains: "The difference in the two arts is this: the white dancer attempts to express fully; the Negro is restrained, but succeeds in gripping the beholder by forcing him to finish the action the performer suggests" (<i>N</i>, 41&#x2013;2). Negro dancing is "dynamic suggestion" that "gives the impression that the dancer will do more." The dancer assumes a pose of flexed knees and a ferocious face and "thrusts the upper part of the body forward with clenched fists, 

<b></b>

elbows taut as in hard running or grasping a thrusting blade. That is all." The spectator, on the other hand, "adds the picture of ferocious assault, hears the drums and finds himself keeping time with the music and tensing himself for the struggle. . . . That is the very reason the spectator is held so rapt. He is participating in the performance himself&#x2014;carrying out the suggestions of the performer" (<i>N</i>, 41). The dialogics of art, the experience of imagining its possibilities, transforming the everyday into a jungle fantasia, opens the present moment to its political unconscious, those narratives that legitimize colonization. Rather than promoting romantic subjectivity&#x2014;the expressive individual self, articulated in and through an autonomous aesthetic&#x2014;Hurston's anthropological vision situates the Negro within a community with which he interacts, the objective social world. Hurston posits Negro expression as sensual and material, that is discontinuous with the present and that reformulates modern life through the prism of black performativity. As such, it forms a characteristically avant-garde reration of temporality. It injects into modern life new modes of sentiment and an "elsewhere," both part of and "post" modernity.  </p>

<p>Specifically, the black diasporic writers in the collection offer what Paul Gilroy calls "a counterculture of modernity," based on performative interruption of the smooth narrative unfolding of modern time (<i>BA</i>, 38&#x2013;40). In this "counterculture of modernity," we can see "the future oriented present" of black diasporic modernism as giving rise to "culturally distinctive innovations" that are "historically redemptive of a sense of past."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  <i>Negro,</i> as a "booklike creation from a fringe area," is a border document in the best sense, one that generates new ways of imagining how modernism travels: its gaps, discontinuities, conflicts and historical differences. In articulating a black transnationalism as a counter to capitalist imperialism, <i>Negro</i>'s scrapbook format challenges racial and class hierarchies, offering in their stead a way of linking together African and black diasporic experiences through the context of a counter-modernity.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT3" href="#REF3">3</a>. <i>The New York </i>Times, April 13, 1934. The <i>Crisis </i>as well as left-leaning journals such as the<i> Liberator </i>and <i>New Masses </i>did not review <i>Negro. </i>Henry Lee Moon, who in 1965 became the editor of the<i> Crisis </i>and Director of Public Relations for the NAACP, praised <i>Negro</i> in both the<i> New Republic </i>and the <i>Amsterdam News,</i> calling it a distinguished contribution to the "world literature of the black race" (<i>New Republic</i> October 24, 1934). The<i> Afro-American </i>ambivalently called the volume "one of the most pretentious and inclusive of any ever published" and noted that "much of [Cunard's] material 

<b></b>

on injustices to the colored man is taken from the weekly press," the very press that Cunard maligned in <i>Negro</i>&#x2014;along with Harlem cliques, the NAACP and Du Bois&#x2014;for catering too much to the white establishment (March 31, 1934). But contributor Arturo Schomburg who reviewed <i>Negro </i>for the Associated Negro Press which was distributed to 300 Negro papers around the United States, enthused: "Within the plethora of pages is encompassed a miniature world where all important happening to the Negroes whose descendents are now portrayed giving articulation to the cultural side for the world to see the bitter feeling in the human machinery of evolution, in its inflexible work." And he recommended its purchase to libraries: "The anthology is here in time to fill a needed and necessary space in our libraries, for its exhaustive illustrations of African sculpture taken from the various great Museums of Europe; for its excellent pictures of people and places; for its peaceful tone and beautiful forms of the printers art and craft. . . . We are highly indebted and express our keen delight for the unselfish contribution on the part of Nancy Cunard, to the cause of the downtrodden lowest man, in helping him to see the light on the road of human emancipation" (HRC). Contributor Eugene Gordon recollected that the anthology was most frequently criticized at the time of its publication for being too wide in scope and too varied in content and, surprisingly, that Cunard had ignored black women and youth. This latter criticism, Gordon felt, was due to fallout from her sexual relationships with black men and the lurid gossip that surrounded her. Problems with <i>Negro </i>at the time of publication stemmed from Cunard's communist leanings and interracial sexual relations, not from her primitivism and racial essentialism (Marcus, 1995, makes this case extensively).  </p>

<div class="fn">
<p>Further praise for <i>Negro</i> came from other black writers who contributed to it. Langston Hughes cabled Cunard immediately with the message: "Your book is marvelous." He maintained a thirty year friendship with her and continued to praise the volume, borrowing from its folklore section for his 1960 anthology, <i>An African Treasury</i> (Langston Hughes Collection, Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University). Jazz pianist Henry Crowder, Cunard's first black lover to whom <i>Negro </i>is dedicated, enthused, "The gratitude of the Negro race is yours, and the admiration of all people of every race who believe in justice." Crowder would later retract his praise in his memoir <i>As Wonderful as That? </i>William Pickens of the NAACP, Alain Locke, John Frederick Mathews, Taylor Gordon, Josephine Schuyler and Eugene Gordon also wrote privately to Cunard to comment favorably on the volume. Taylor Gordon called it "the talk of the country" and a textbook for students who are inclined to "think black" (HRC). Nigerian contributor T.K. Utchay named his daughter Nancy and a school he founded the Cunardia School in her honor. Hugh D. Ford, introduction to <i>Negro: An Anthology</i>, by Nancy Cunard, ed. and abridged by Hugh D. Ford (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1970), xxvii; hereafter abbreviated as <i>HDF</i>. More recently, a former student of C. L. R. James, Aldon Nielsen, remembers that James owned a copy of <i>Negro</i> "and often showed [it] to his students in later decades." <i>C. L. R.. James: A Critical Introduction</i> (Jackson: Mississippi University Press, 1997), 170.

<p><a name="FOOT4" href="#REF4">4</a>. Historian Gary Wilder provides a good basis for understanding this phenomenon. These diverse transnational populations, he writes, "spread across disjunctive territories and [are] subject to diverse regimes of governance." Further, these "transnational forms of identification become a modality through which to participate in national politics of an imperial power" . Wilder demonstrates, in particular, how 1930s French Republicanism and Pan-Africanism entailed one another. For instance, Wilder reports that "numerous black organizations participated in the mid-1930s Popular Front mobilization in defense of the national republic." Cunard, he says, was also there and wrote that colonial groups not only rallied for the republic but chanted slogans such as "Africa for the Africans" and carried banners that said "Equal Rights and Equal Status for North African and Colonial Workers," or "t Mussolini's Aggression on Ethiopia."

<p><a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>. Jane Marcus's groundbreaking work on <i>Negro</i> defends "its unique place as a biracial text" . She argues that we should "read <i>Negro </i>as creating a cross-cultural and cross-racial contact zone that connects Harlem and Paris with Zimbabwe and Haiti, Alabama and Brazil with lynching in America, 

<b></b>

and the history of African art with hundreds [of] drawings and photographs" so that "it will perhaps emerge with all its contradictions intact as a way of understanding race relations in Europe and the black Atlantic between the wars." Jane Marcus, <i>Hearts of Darkness: White Women Write Race </i>(New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 2004), 17; hereafter abbreviated <i>HD</i>. Nonetheless, contemporary black critics continue to balk at Cunard's and <i>Negro</i>'s primitivism, as Marcus also notes (<i>HD</i>, 120). For instance, Mae G. Henderson, who introduces Marcus's essay on Cunard, "Bonding and Bondage: Nancy Cunard and the Making of the Negro Anthology," asks "whether or not Cunard's 'transgressions' are subversive or complicit with the dominant culture. Does she replicate or reproduce the colonization her actions and commitment are surely meant to reproduce? What, finally, are the implications of Marcus' own critical act of recuperation?" Mae G. Henderson, ed. and intro., <i>Borders, Boundaries, and Frames: Cultural Criticism and Cultural Studies </i>(New York: Routledge, 1995), 8. See also Petrine Archer-Straw's reading of Cunard and <i>Negro </i>in note 6 below. In response to Henderson, Marcus cautions that "unless and until black critics and readers find the exiled white radical 'race woman' sympathetic, . . . she will not find her place in history" (<i>HD</i>, 121).  </p>

<div class="fn">
<p><a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>. Petrine Archer-Straw foregrounds Cunard's avant-gardist cosmopolitanism that led her to romanticize race: "Like many negrophiles influenced by L&#x00E9;vy-Bruhl's thinking, [Cunard] believed that culture was determined by race and environment and that blacks belonged to a primitive chaotic order rooted in nature that needed to be maintained for their cultural authenticity. It was their <i>joie de vivre </i>and connectedness with nature that could be used to revitalize white civilization" . This attention to Cunard's primitivism extends to Archer-Straw's reading of <i>Negro </i>as a whole: <i>Negro, </i>she writes, is a "selection gained from [Cunard's] travels and networking, rather than a reflection of a pan-African network. Despite Cunard's tireless appeals for fresh and definitive articles, the material collated was more personal and anecdotal than global. <i>Negro</i>'s eventual unevenness was an indicator of Cunard's ambition and frustration. Politicized material appears to have been lacking, and where gaps existed Cunard tried to fill them." Petrine Archer-Straw, <i>Negrophilia: Avant-Garde Paris and Black Culture in the 1920s </i>(New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000), 168. I disagree. The pan-African, political and anthropological material was groundbreaking for its time, and I suggest that we read the gaps as a symptom of transnationalism rather than as a flaw.

<p><a name="FOOT7" href="#REF7">7</a>. My understanding of transnational reading practices has been tremendously aided by Brent Hayes Edwards's work on what he calls the black internationalism of the African diaspora. Edwards defines the term diaspora as one "that marks the ways that internationalism is pursued by translation. This is not to say that internationalism is doomed to failure, but instead to note that it necessarily involves a process of linking or connecting across gaps" (<i>PD</i>, 11). Edwards holds that this connection across gaps serves as a "frame of cultural identity" determined through difference as much as through identification (<i>PD</i>, 12).  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT8" href="#REF8">8</a>. The key problem with cosmopolitanism is that it partakes in European universalism, what Simon Gikandi calls its "fatal linkage between race, nation, and cosmopolitanism in the genesis of modernity." Simon Gikandi, "Race and Cosmopolitanism," <i>American Literary History </i>14, no.3 : 597. Timothy Brennan argues against historical revisions of cosmopolitanism by critics such as Bruce Robbins to include the cosmopolitan experiences of working-class migrants: "cosmopolitanism offers a coming into 'modernity' as the global entrance into a common hybrid self-consciousness by formerly subjugated peoples, without in the least disturbing the self-portraiture of the West. For if we wished to capture the essence of cosmopolitanism in a single formula, it would be this. It is a discourse of the universal that is inherently local&#x2014;a locality that's always surreptiously imperial." Timothy Brennan, "Cosmopolitanism and Internationalism," <i>New Left Review </i>7 (January&#x2013;February 2001): 81.

Reviewing <i>Negro</i>, Edward Thompson in the <i>Observer </i>(London) April 15, 1934, wrote that "This is the most difficult book I ever had to review. . . . Its editor is without inhibitions, and has therefore been able to accept from every quarter and to put out her stuff as it came to her, straightforwardly. The result is not an anthology, but an encyclopedia, a book for two entirely different publics [the ultra-modern aesthetic public and the "square-toed sombre public"], each of which, I think, will look askance at the other." Herbert Read in the<i> Spectator</i> (London, February 23, 1934) began his review by indicating that it was "no light matter to review; and its very varied contents are beyond the scope of a single reviewer" . However, he <i>could </i>boil down its purpose to being that of "a manifesto and a protest" (ibid.). </p>

Surely I was being taught as much about El Dorado and the North Pole? Later came extraordinary dreams about black Africa&#x2014;'The Dark Continent'&#x2014;with Africans dancing and drumming around me, and I one of them, though still white, knowing, mysteriously enough, how to dance in their own manner.

<p id="lead">In 1966 S.Y Agnon received half the Nobel Prize in literature "for his profoundly characteristic narrative art with motifs from the life of the Jewish people."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Born in Buczacz, eastern Galicia, in 1888, Agnon came of age as a writer under the same influences and constraints experienced by other Jewish writers from the outskirts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Yet unlike the better-known examples of Franz Kafka or Bruno Schulz, Agnon came from a religious Jewish background and remained within the sphere of Jewish culture and politics. Turning to Zionism at a young age, Agnon immigrated to Palestine in 1907, quickly becoming a central re in the nascent world of modern Hebrew literature. He would become its undisputed master.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  </p>

<p>One might append the Swedish Academy's citation to suggest that Agnon's writing is as "characteristic" of European modernism as it is of the "Jewish people," although he perceives the European crisis through the lens of a Jewish believer in a world perhaps not without God but certainly a world from which God has receded. The result, I would like to argue, can be seen in Agnon's 1939 major novel <i>A Guest for the Night,</i> a work in which crisis and fragmentation are tucked beneath an apparently realistic textual surface.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  By examining the sense of death in the novel it is possible to penetrate this surface and see that by telling the story of his return to Europe, Agnon perceives and laments the death of European Judaism, and that this perception necessitates the creation of an allegorical, even post-modern novel in which narrative succumbs to death and destruction.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The novel, I argue, is also a major turning point in Agnon's work. Here he enters his own death as a narrator and becomes an Author. Unconsoled 

<b></b>

 by the rebirth of Jewish life in Palestine, his return to Europe is a return to a literary space of death. The death of Agnon as a narrator who is an author and his rebirth as a modern (already dead) author in the novel, is therefore in a very real sense almost beyond Zionism; at the very least, it is a denial of an organic and redemptive continuity between the Jewish past in Europe and the Zionist present and future in Palestine.  </p>

<p><i>A Guest for the Night</i> is one of Agnon's central works and his first full-scale novel set in contemporary Europe.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The novel was written in 1938 and published serially in the <i>Haaretz</i> newspaper in 1939, as Hitler invaded Poland. The novel is overtly biographical: it tells the story of a writer, Shmuel Agnon, a native of Shibush who immigrates to Palestine at the beginning of the century and builds a home there. His house is burnt down in the 1929 riots. Now in midlife, he sends his wife and children to Germany to stay with relatives; he returns to his hometown, a literary simulacrum of Agnon's Galician hometown of Buczacz. The town he returns to has changed, and painfully so; its physical features and its once thriving Jewish population have been devastated by the wars, including the Russo-Polish war of 1919&#x2013;1920, in which the mass killings of Jews have all but fallen into oblivion in the wake of subsequent events.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The writer, supported by the low value of Polish currency, uses the compensation he receives from the British mandate authorities in Palestine to stay in his hometown for almost a year. During this year he resides in a small family-run hotel and attempts to revive the old <i>BeitMidrash</i> (house of study). In the course of this attempt the narrator meets many of the town's inhabitants who invoke the more and less remote past of Jewish life in the town. The novel ends with the narrator's failure to revive the town's <i>Beit Midrash</i>. He returns to Palestine with his wife and children&#x2014;and with the key to the <i>Beit Midrash</i>, which he thought he had lost.  </p>

<p>By examining the sense of death in the novel, one can see beyond the verisimilitude of the narrative and understand how Agnon's literary position was decidedly political. A large portion of the narrative is dedicated to the impossibility of surviving as a Jew in Poland. This is clearly due to the obliteration of the Jews' role as social and economic mediators in an undemocratic society that was deeply stratified by class.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Modernity and nationalism in Europe obviated the Jew, whose main attribute is his otherness; even after 800 years in Poland, he is considered non-native. Agnon sees and understands this but is not blinded by the Zionist view that seeks to remedy this situation by giving Jews access to land and indigenous privilege in the historical homeland of Palestine.  </p>

<p>It is within this historical frame that Agnon's novel binds the literary and the political discourses by undoing the continuity of space. He turns to a representation of space as a literary space of death and disrupts the supposedly natural flow of Jews and Judaism from (dead) Europe to Palestine. In order to support these claims, it is necessary to examine the mode of discourse and representation of the novel through a rative inquiry. By examining the trope of death, rative language can be seen as the point 

<b></b>

 where the political and literary spheres meet to form the main theatre of cultural dynamics. Finally, I locate the voice of the author not in the words of the diegetic narrator but rather in the fragmented discourse of the handicapped baby Raphael, with whom the narrator has some very meaningful meetings.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The search for a modern death begins with the romantic notion that a life not endangered is not really lived.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  This conception of death also sets the stage for the modern spectacle of mass death brought about by the First World War and propagated by new technologies and modes of representation.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Heidegger sees the modern problem of giving sense and meaning to death as one that finds its ground in the place where the individual meets the community: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>If fateful Da-sein essentially exists as being-in-the-world in being-with others, its occurrence is an occurrence-with and is determined as <i>destiny.</i> With this term, we designate the occurrence of the community, of a people. Destiny is not composed of individual fates, nor can being-with-one-another be conceived of as the mutual occurrence of several subjects. These fates are already guided beforehand in being-with-one-another in the same world and in the resoluteness for the definite possibilities. In communication and in battle the power of destiny first becomes free. The fateful destiny of Da-sein in and with its "generation" constitutes the complete, authentic occurrence of Da-sein.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>This passage is left quite unexplained by Heidegger, but it seems clear that it is in war that Da-sein is at its most authentic, war being the place where the normal existential relation to death is reversed. If in everyday life Da-sein is related to an inevitable possibility of its own death, in war it would seem that death is inevitable and survival becomes a possibility. The power of destiny is freed when Da-sein is faced with the national community, determined as such by the shared certainty of death. As loaded as this passage may be, it suggests what Georges Bataille later conceives as the "Community of Death".<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  What Bataille argues is that death is the only place where the community is such; therefore, it remains unknowable and unrepresentable. In other words, one must draw a distinction between the community as that which is a property of the subject and that which appropriates the subject. In this, Bataille preres Foucault's later description of the appropriation of life itself by the modern state, what he calls biopolitics. It seems that what Heidegger describes as Da-sein's most authentic being is an existential description and perhaps even exaltation of biopolitics&#x2014;in which life itself becomes the subject of politics.  </p>

<p>All this seems rather removed from the small-town world Agnon describes in <i>A Guest for the Night</i>. Yet it is exactly these relations between individual, community, and power that Zionism addresses in seeking to self-manage the Jewish population. In the novel they take form through the re of the Zionist author in search of a community that has been lost but might be reborn in the old-new country. In fact when Lev Pinsker, in <i>Autoemancipation,</i> jump-starts Zionism, he begins with the analysis 

<b></b>

 that the Jews are the walking dead.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  What follows from Pinsker's analysis is that all forms of Zionism are concerned with teaching the Jews to live; in terms of modern nationalism, this means teaching them to die a national death.  </p>

<p>By shifting the traditional paradigms of the meaning of life Zionism suggests a politicization of the Jews that radically changes the meaning of Jewish death: if once Jewish (violent) death was justified by the dedication to God, modern Jewish (violent) death becomes acceptable only as a sacrifice to the nation or people.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  These ideas are present in the structure of Agnon's narrative. The return of the Zionist author to his "dead" native town shows just how different the Jewish sense of death and sense of community are from the European ones. In Hebrew, the notion of community itself is that which shares ground facing a voice: <i>kehila </i>is derived from the word "voice," <i>kol</i>. The Zionist sense of community does not necessarily change this, and the voice of the author becomes the communal (national) voice as the author comes into his death<i>.</i> Though Zionism is a product of the meeting between Judaism and European nationalism, it is also its victim. A rebellious subversive current is present within Zionism, and it is apparent in the work of Agnon.  </p>

<p>At first it seems that <i>A Guest for the Night</i> should be read ideologically. The narrator is a writer returning to his hometown, and he is a Zionist in an almost obtuse manner. Materially he is much better off then his fellow Jews, and he quickly becomes a small-scale philanthropist. On such a reading one would understand his attempt to resurrect the old <i>beit midrash</i> as an expression of victorious Zionism coming to the rescue of ailing European Judaism. Such a reading requires us to deem realistic the novel's representation of the devastated circumstances that the narrator finds. It also requires us to identify the narrator with the biographical Agnon. The bare facts clearly point to such a simple identity, and this has brought all leading interpreters of the novel equate the narrator with the writer without reservations.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Motivated in the end by political considerations, the identity between author and narrator is crucial since it sees the narrative voice as designating the writer who, at least linguistically, is alive, and who in turn indicates a real external world. This approach has not been affected by the deconstruction of the Author.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Though few readers would perhaps uphold this position theoretically, they are happy do so when it comes to discussing Agnon and for the whole right-wing of Hebrew letters he remains the undisputed authority and source of meaning in his works.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Since most of the episodes in <i>A Guest for the Night</i> seem realistic, such a view does not seem unnatural. It underscores the importance of understanding the sense of death in the novel, since this provides a way to cut through the screen of verisimilitude and to review the major interpretations of the novel. Such a revision is necessary if one is to claim that we are dealing with an allegorical novel that systematically undermines its links to the world outside the text. Though such a view destabilizes the author, it does 

<b></b>

 not necessarily exclude the viability of discussing Agnon's work historically; in doing so, it will always be forming a tentative allegory of continuity that remains conscious of its own temporality.  </p>

<p>It is therefore somewhat surprising that readings of the novel have thus far seen it in the kind of realistic light that poses few problems of interpretation. This leads some to even conclude that: "The narrator who entered the story has died as a personality: he has discovered his Shibush is no more, and he therefore undergoes a rebirth signified in the birth and circumcision of the child who will bear his name"<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  This further demonstrates the importance of understanding the sense of death, since it turns out that a realistic reading describes a linear process in which the narrator's life is a kind of flame passed on to a supposedly 'human' baby. In these terms the narrator's death is a metaphor mediating between himself and the baby, both conceived as 'alive'; death is a re, a symbolic mode binding the generations that create a living national body. In this view, the imagined nation is a reality of which the real person is only a re, a synecdoche.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>   </p>

<p>These critical efforts to avoid an allegorical reading are evidence of a failure to negotiate between the means of enunciation and the layers of meaning. In fact it seems that interpretations of the novel divide along this collision. While some see it as the failure of the narrator to 'know himself,'<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  others see it as the meeting of autobiographical realism with the explicitly unrealistic level representing the narrator's past, a sign of a consciousness oscillating between mature metonym and childish metaphor.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  </p>

<p>As might be expected the "realists" settle this discrepancy by amplifying another reality. Dan Laor, Agnon's biographer, admits that Agnon only spent a week in his hometown and that his reports from the visit weren't bleak at all, but they assume Agnon is really writing about the events of 1938, the Arab Revolt and the preliminary acts of World War II.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Agnon in this view was capable of capturing the impending catastrophe inherent to the Jewish condition within European modernism, since he was equipped with Zionist ideology, which acknowledged the supremacy of the Zionist enterprise over doomed Jewish life in the Diaspora.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Amplifying reality and psychologizing the writer are related practices designed to maintain Agnon as the authority in the novel and as such a Zionist one. The resistance to allegory can therefore be explained by its being the beginning of the deconstruction of the text and its meaning. Such a procedure undermines the whole symbolic system that ideologically binds the subject to the public in the modern national literary canon.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  This is obviously the political motivation behind the hesitation to apply deconstructive literary theory to Agnon's work. This is also why the core element of the novel's sense of death, the death of the Author, is ignored. By death of the Author I mean the metaphysical elimination of the Author from the text and his conversion into language. Blanchot found this to be the essence of modern literary space, epitomized by Kafka, another author aware of the decline of western civilization into new forms of barbarity. Both Kafka and Agnon, in Blanchot's words, are quite conscious of the empty vanity of a claim for immortality in literature. They dissolve the narrative life into a literary space of death.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>As seen above, the determination of the novel's mode of representation is crucial for any reading. The importance of this is revealed as <i>A Guest for the Night</i> opens with a description of the arrival of the narrator at his hometown, Shibush. This, I argue, is an entrance into a dead world that takes place within a loose system of allegorical representation, making little effort to mask its artifice and death-like representation of a world that is not alive.  </p>

<p>Emphasizing the alienation between author and artifact, the novel opens with a tableau of exposed death and destruction. Everything takes place on the eve of Yom Kippur, when God decides life or death, and begins with a meeting between the narrator and the station attendant, Gumowitch - literally rubber man in Hebrew&#x2014;who announces the train's arrival at the Shibush station. The guest gets off the train and, like Dante in the middle of his life, he cannot find his way: "It takes an ordinary man a half hour to walk to the center of town; carrying baggage, it takes a quarter of an hour more. I took an hour and a half: every house, every ruin, every heap of rubbish faced me and held me up" (AGN, 2).  </p>

<p>The narrator is being as realistic as he can be. He explains precisely why he was held up, but this delay has no reason if the text is not the world, as is made clear in the description of the town that follows:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Of the large houses of two, three, or four stories, nothing was left except the lower levels, and those were also mostly ruined. And of some houses nothing remained at all but their place. Even the King's Well, from which Sobiesky, King of Poland, has drunk when he returned victorious from war, has its steps broken, its commemorative tablet fractured; the golden letters of his name were faded and sprouted weeds as red as blood, as if the angel of death had wiped his knife upon them. There were no gentile boys and girls standing and not a sound of laughter or singing could be heard, and the well spouted water pouring it into the street, as it is poured in the neighborhood of the dead. All the places had changed. Even the space between houses had changed. Nothing was as I had seen it when I was small, nor as it was shown to me in a dream shortly before my return. But the odor of Shibush had not yet changed.</p>

<p>The scene is almost a typical baroque allegory and has little in common with Agnon's visit to Buczacz in 1930 when, according to his own testimony, he was received as a king, the streets crowded with people who would not leave his side.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  But here all is empty. One does not really have to confront reality to know this since the description formulaically represents an entrance into a space of death, into allegory. Every word in this description is somehow related to the line engraving the difference between nature and meaning. As Walter Benjamin wrote:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In allegory the observer is confronted with the <i>facies hippocratica</i> of history as a petrified primordial landscape. Everything about history that, from the very beginning, has been untimely, sorrowful, unsuccessful is expressed in a face&#x2014;or rather in a death's head. This is the heart of the allegorical way of seeing, of the baroque, secular explanation of history 

<b></b>

 as the passion of the world; its importance resides only in the stations of its decline. The greater the significance, the greater the subjection to death, because death digs most deeply the jagged line of demarcation between physical nature and significance. But if nature has always been subject to the power of death, it is also true that it has always been allegorical.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>The feeling of having entered a dead world increases when one takes into account the fact that Agnon had revised the novel from the first Hebrew edition of 1939 to the second, published in 1950. While the Yiddish modernist Yakov Glatstein found he could not complete his Yash trilogy, which tells of a similar return, because his historical analysis had collapsed in the face of the Shoah<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> , Agnon had no trouble making changes&#x2014;though he did not make any that actually change the plot or its core meaning. If we look at the entrance scene, we see that the changes he made only further accentuated the feeling of entering a dead world that already inhabited the text in the 1939 edition. For example, in the first edition the weeds that grow around Sobiesky's Well are just weeds, while in the later edition, the one quoted, they are "as red as blood, as if the angel of death had wiped his knife on them." In the first edition the water pours from the well as if someone had died in a house, while in the later edition the house turns into a whole neighborhood, an echo of the belief that the angel of death dips his sword in the waters near the deceased in order to sharpen it, therefore contaminating them. It is clear that this kind of revision, made only a few years after the Shoah, is possible only because the world of the story is already dead, and the death of the author in this world has already indicated the destruction of Jewish life in Europe&#x2014;that is, before it physically came about.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>   </p>

<p>One should notice here that signs of reality, such as Shibush's unchanged smell, impede the allegorical reading. Certainly this is a reality effect as Roland Barthes described it, a signifier that has no function beyond the designation of reality.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  This brings us back to the notion that verisimilitude is of the very nature of allegory, as allegorical paintings clearly demonstrate; it does not entail an absence of story, as Paul de Man puts it: "It is a part of allegory that, despite its obliqueness and innate obscurity, the resistance to understanding emanates from the difficulty or censorship inherent in the statement and not from the devices of enunciation."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  This means that the claim of allegory pertains to the meaning of the narrative and to the way it is constantly deconstructed, exposing the artificiality of representation.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  It is fundamental in allegory to face this hesitation between modes of reading, just as deconstruction has no meaning without structure. Both require a conflict between an interpretation that makes fiction real and one that sees reality as fictitious.  </p>

<p>As Agnon the narrator enters the town he meets his wood-legged Virgil, Daniel Bach. Bach lost his leg not in the war but in his struggle for livelihood. He leads the narrator to the hotel where he will stay during the whole visit. A broken family runs the hotel, which is itself a broken re of a home in which ruined men come to stay for the night. Bach's importance as a guide is twofold: on the level of faith he presents the narrator with a real problem, and he also leads us to his son, baby Raphael, who in my interpretation is a re of the Author. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>In the area of faith Daniel Bach presents a challenge not in that he is a heretic, but in that, significantly, his heresy is based on the view that God is in fact involved in history. The following dialogue takes place between the narrator, Daniel Bach, and Daniel's father, who is about to go to Palestine and join the kibbutz of his son, Yerucham, who was killed in the clashes in Kibbutz Ramat Rachel, not far from Agnon's home in Jerusalem. </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>How pleasant my journey would be if you promised me, my son, that you would follow the right way. Daniel jumped up from his chair, placed his right hand on his heart and pointed upwards with his left. Perhaps it was I that made the way crooked, he said, it was He that made it so. Leave it be, said his father, Leave it be. Whatever the Almighty does He does in order to test us. If we stand the test, all the better, and if not, he sends another one, more difficult. Said Daniel, Doesn't the Almighty see that we can't stand his first tests that he troubles himself to putting us to new ones?</p>

<p>The discussion is about history and the role of God in it, the question being whether it expresses the will of God or not. The tendency to judge history in moral terms, though obvious, demands explanation. Following Barthes' observation about the moral character of narrative, Hayden White explains the shift from the writing of chronicles to the writing of history as the entrance of a teleological moral into the way a series of events is perceived.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  It seems Agnon is well aware of this, though not unlike Benjamin he finds history to be a secular concept lacking a messianic dimension. The chronicle is then an acceptance of the world as it is, while history allows moral judgment and a view of it as a manifestation of divine will. The passage from the father's faith, in the world's hardships as a test, to the son, who finds such testing techniques unworthy of worship, is only natural and quite an acute observation on the nature of Jewish secularization through <i>Haskala</i> (Jewish enlightenment). This goes a long way to explaining the concept of Jewish history and Zionism in Agnon's later works. The disintegration of the narrated world into allegory seems to grow from the incapacity of Jewish narrative to find a morality that is not messianic. Agnon is actually avoiding history in this way, or, rather, he is exposing its <i>facies hippocratica</i>. This of course further serves to explain the resistance to deconstruction in the Agnon School that is ill at ease admitting its own Zionist messianic dimension.  </p>

<p>Overwhelmed by history, the sense of death undergoes change, the narrative no longer represents life, or a public, but <i>Hurban</i>&#x2014;disaster&#x2014;the layers of rubble laid one on top of the other, an archeological site to which only God can give meaning as a whole. Death of course is omnipresent in the story but never mimetically, only as another example of an infinite chain, always opposed to the seemingly live re of the narrator, forcing us to re-question his status in the novel. Once we realize the ruined nature of the world in the novel the question of the author's death becomes all the more imperative, since if he is alive in that world one could and perhaps should remain faithful to a Zionist interpretation of organic continuity of Jewish life in Palestine.  </p>

<p>Perhaps one can begin by noticing that it is made very clear that the narrator is not actually the one who has written the story, as we are told in the end: 

<b></b>

  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>And here I must explain how, if I am a writer, I let the time pass and did not write a thing all those days I dwelt in Shibush. Well if something comes and knocks on my heart I send it away, when it knocks again I say: don't you know I hate the smell of ink? When I see that I have no escape I do my work, if only so that I shall not be pestered again. Those days I spent in my town many things came and knocked on my heart. Since I sent them off they all went away and never came back.</p>

<p class="continued">Even though Cervantes had already ridden through this position some time before, it still seems the point can be lost at times; in fact, the accepted reading of this passage is that it is a violation of the narrative illusion that serves to cement the bond between narrator and author.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This is possible, of course, but this view requires us to negate language and cling to the person of the author as a source of meaning. Both editions are identical at this point, and I find it more sensible, if not more meaningful, to accept that the narrator is a writer but not the author of his story - only the narrator.  </p>

<p>In my view <i>A Guest for the Night</i> is the place where Agnon transforms the Author, tearing him away from the narrator. This rupture destabilizes the fiction, and we must draw some conclusions. This is what is avoided when reading continues to be of a text as mimetic of consciousness. The narrator as a writer and as a persona in the novel merits psychological analysis. Agnon is merciless: he exposes the narrator as an unconscious, obtuse, rather self-righteous person from beginning to end. The Author on the other hand is a medium, a vehicle of the text and of language, and he cannot be reconstructed from the text since he does not construct or control it.  </p>

<p>The resiliency of criticism in front of the rift between text and author exposes what Foucault would consider our desire to see the human as a rational being, implied, according to him, in the modern concept of the author.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The allegorical impulse tends to come equipped with a pessimistic view of human nature and destiny, a point that is emphasized by the disintegration of the line separating life and death. The uncanny status of death in the story demonstrates this. An example of this can be seen in the disappearance of Hanoch, a traveling peddler who is found after the winter frozen and clinging to his horse Enoch. Before he is found we are told:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Not like Hanoch who troubled the Enoch for nothing, and now they are both wandering in the world of chaos and no one knows where they are. Some say that they showed themselves in a dream. And why did they not ask Hanoch where he is? Because he showed himself dead and they were afraid to speak with a dead man.</p>

<p class="continued">Death is not only the rule of the world represented but of the literary in itself. Besides speaking of death and the dead, all signs of life in the text are like the water in Sobiesky's Well, signifying death and absence. The narrator's visit to the local cemetery is therefore a natural site for such a reflection:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I walk among the graves and think of nothing at all, but the two emissaries of the heart, these my two eyes, gaze and see. These eyes are under control of the heart, and the heart belongs to Him who gives life or death. Sometimes he allows contemplating the living, sometimes the dead.

</p>
<p>Those that died before the war and those who died in the war and those that died after the war lie here together, as if there were no difference between them. So long as they lived, some were sorry for times that have been and will never come back and some expected those to come, since they became dead, these have lost their assumptions and the former grieve no more.</p>
<p>All the powers of the eye are measured, and a man sees only to the measure of his eyes. But the dead, even if you lay your eyes one upon the other, still they come and stand before you and you fathom their parable.</p>

<p>Craig Owens explained that in allegory the concept of time is non-linear and events happen simultaneously, vertically, like views given one on top of the other&#x2014;just like the views in the cemetery.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Likewise all the crises dealt with in the novel are laid vertically, one on top of the other: the narrator's midlife crisis, the crisis of Judaism, of European modernity, faith, marriage, the crisis of representation - all are simultaneous, or at least do not occur in an empty homogenous time. The narrator does in fact die, but not at a certain point in time, and not <i>simply</i>. His death occurs on the level in which writing effaces the existence of the person writing. Although the death of the author is hardly a new concept, it is nevertheless relevant here. The measure of the eye's sight discussed in front of the dead is explained by the poetic turn. The bond between life and work is limiting since life is revealed to us in a limited manner. This limit is surpassed when confronted with the dead, when you understand the fable of the dead as an allegory of the world.  </p>

<p>It is then the dead presence of the author, in the diegetic world carried by the narrator, that is the cause of the metaphysical presence of Agnon the writer and the residue of Agnon in person. As Barthes explains:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>As soon as a fact is <i>narrated</i> no longer with a view to acting directly on reality but intransitively, that is to say, finally outside of any function other than that of the very practice of the symbol itself, this disconnection occurs, the voice loses its origin the author enters into his own death, writing begins.</p>

<p class="continued">The beginning of writing is then the end of control over meaning; the author makes his entrance no longer as a person, but as an allegory of textual interpretation. Agnon at this point has stepped beyond the dichotomy represented by the conflict between life and art, into a space where life is relinquished and the author enters the literary space in which life and art no longer differ. The narrator is a character, not a person, and because he is acting out Agnon, the connection between him and Agnon is all the more dubious and ironic. </p>

<p>The attempt to bind the biographical Agnon to the meaning of the text, or vice versa, can only fail. The narrator is not breaking the illusion of narrative; it is already broken, fragmented by explicit intertextuality. The novel, in fact, bears the name of the ninth chapter in an earlier piece by Agnon, "C<i>hupat Dodim </i>- A Lovers Canopy," the story of a cemetery keeper who marries a dead woman.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  The irony that characterizes the novel is indeed what Paul de Man names the mother of all tropes, the moment in 

<b></b>

 which language turns away, saying one thing and another, and another. The allegorical mode brings about the death of the narrator as author and writer, but in exchange it offers us the dismembered life of the text.  </p>

<p>All of this is enticingly red in Raphael the baby, the invalid son of Daniel Bach, who among other things is a re of the text, of the innate interiority from which the narrator keeps departing, being himself a re of reading. Obviously both are regular characters as well, if that can be said, but the baby also ironizes the idea that the text is born of the writer. Like a text he brings all things to him, abandoning movement in the real world and the distinction between life and art, death and life, the dead and the living. Read in a realistic key, Raphael is a heart-breaking boy, but as an allegory of the author, Raphael is a heart-warming phenomenon, uncommitted to coherence: one can find in him a glimpse of the redemptive that is characteristic of allegory. The meetings the narrator has with Raphael help to clarify the passage from a mimetic sense of death to an allegorical one. They show it to be a shift in the relations between text, author, and narrator as well as a political shift from Zionist activity to Jewish resignation and lament. It is a passage from text as a representation of a real life to a place where life, though present, remains outside the literary space, requiring all who enter to abandon hope. The meetings between the narrator as writer and the baby as author show the difference between one who still thinks he controls meaning and one who cannot control it and is devoted to catastrophe. </p>

<p>Agnon, pace Zionism, sees that this process of decline cannot be stopped or solved. Though Zionism allows some hope, it is only a very precarious hope, and since it has been made possible within Jewish secularization, it remains a non-redemptive one. It is here in the work of Agnon&#x2014;seeped as much in traditional texts, as it is in European ones&#x2014;that the fundamental inadequacy of such a notion is exposed. Zionism is a Jewish movement made possible by a reconration of a sacred language and its most basic meaning&#x2014;its sense of death. This does not only mean finding a national meaning to death, as seems required by Bialik in "The City of Slaughter" (written after the Kishniev pogroms of 1903), but, as Agnon does not fail to notice, it also means the displacement of the Messiah and a reconration of the relationship between the text and the world.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  This is very serious, since the possibility of a Jewish nation is based on that textuality, which is religious. Therefore, insofar as it is Jewish, it is allegorical; it represents the only way God can exist in the text.  </p>

<p>In the beginning there was the Word, and Zionism's beginnings are nothing but textual, yet this very modern notion&#x2014;of a text creating reality, depicting it, and binding a community to it&#x2014;runs counter to the Messiah. As the later work of Agnon shows, without the Messiah what is left of Judaism is not very interesting. In fact it is in <i>A Guest for the Night</i> that Agnon begins to turn away from Zionism and its teleological concept of history, where the state substitutes for the Messiah in the search for redemption. While the destruction of Jewish space in Europe necessitates and justifies the move to Palestine, it is deprived of any theological meaning: history itself remains a heap of catastrophes and destruction going nowhere. The only real community is the community of death and of the dead, which is, and always has been, a textual community, 

<b></b>

 timeless and without territory. This is a community always awaiting the coming of that which will render man One&#x2014;part of a community that defies representation, the real community that can never be represented in language, and is the one always simulated, faked and abused by the nation.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Baby Raphael, who is familiar with Agnon's work as only an Author can be, demonstrates quite well, I think, how our journey into the sense of death serves to turn what in a mimetic reading would be a nonsensical childish discourse into a deep reflection on the nature of life, art, and the representation of both. I conclude with a quote from one of these scenes, which begins with Raphael asking about his dead uncle and living grandfather who went to Palestine. The narrator is present and the baby is talking to his parents:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>And does he see my uncle Yeruham? The child asked his father. But Uncle is already dead, said his father, so how can he be seen? And if he is dead can't he be seen. No my love, said the baby's mother, he can't be seen.</p>
<p>The baby was silent for a while, then asked again, why did the Arab not die, the Arab was not a good man. After all he killed my uncle. What is dead? Is everyone you don't see dead? Said his mother, some of them have died and some are alive. The baby asked his mother, then how do we know who is dead and who's alive?</p>
<p>His mother sighed and said, my love, don't mention the dead&#x2014;why?&#x2014;So they won't show themselves in your dreams.&#x2014;But if they're seen isn't that a sign they're alive? Mother, and is Yerhuham Freeman already dead?&#x2014;Why?&#x2014;Because I don't see him. His mother sighed and said; of course you don't see him, that's because he stopped coming here. Why doesn't he come here? Sighed his mother, because he is happy in another place. What is another place? A place that isn't here is another place. Said the baby, and I, am I not here either? Said the mother, no my love, my darling, you're here, you're here. Why, asked the baby am I here and not in another place? Said the mother, because you, my love, are a little weak and you can't walk with your legs. Said the baby, now I know&#x2014;what do you know my love?&#x2014;Why all the places come to me.</p>

An even more poignant example is found in Pirandello's <i>Il Fu Mattia Pascal</i>, which tells in 1904 of Mattia Pascal's inability to die without the sanction of the modern state. The impossibility of dying outside bureaucracy can also be seen as a limit of the self conceived as an object of design, an attitude that Foucault describes as the essence of the modern attitude in Baudelaire: "The Salon of 1859" <i>Art in Paris 1845&#x2013;1862</i>, ed.

The main reason for this seems to be the insistence on reading Agnon in a strictly Hebrew and Zionist context as well as the attempted appropriation of Agnon by the religious Zionist right-wing based around Bar Ilan University. Understandably, this type of scholarship is concentrated on philological research into the religious origins of Agnon's textuality.

The example of the smell of Shibush serves to further demonstrate the allegorical nature of the novel when compared to Agnon's earliest long work, <i>And the Crooked Shall be Straight</i>.

Rabbi Menashe returns only to find out that he is considered dead and must remain that way.

When returning Rabbi Menashe finds the town unchanged except for the smell, which, he begs our pardon, is the smell of pig excrement: S.Y.

<p id="lead">The year 1492 has often been invoked as the critical marker of the dawn of modernity. The year commemorates the beginnings of two journeys, one in which the Americas were "opened up" and the new world was discovered; the other in which a flourishing Jewish community was expelled per royal decree from Spain. Both journeys brought about multifaceted, contradictory, and unforeseeable outcomes. On the one hand, immeasurable suffering was inflicted on those who lost their freedom and livelihood through the expulsion; on the other hand, the groundwork for a new interconnected world of commerce and exchange was created. And at the same time that the Jews of Spain lost their heritage and culture, their fate gave birth to a new culture and language rooted, so to speak, in the historical experience of uprootedness.  </p>

<p>This nexus of discovery and expulsion represents a paradigmatic experience of what we&#x2014;retrospectively&#x2014;perceive to be the experience of modernity, particularly the dramatic social and economic transformations that we associate with the birth of the modern<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>: the rise of the natural sciences, the ascendancy of reason and rationality, the redefinition of the role of religion, the birth of the modern city, and the emergence of participatory systems of rule. At the same time, these phenomena were, of course, accompanied by the disenchantment of the world, the instrumentalization of reason, the loss of spirituality, the atomization and alienation of society, and the rise of totalitarianism. Modernity can hardly be seen as the marker of progress alone; it has always been accompanied by violence and suffering. Thus, it is more precise to speak about the dialectic of modernity, the hopes and catastrophes that simultaneously gave rise to its progressive and regressive strands.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Following their expulsion, European Jews no longer enjoyed the kinds of privileges and protections that were afforded them in the Middle Ages as "service nomads," to use Yuri Slezkine's helpful concept&#x2014;that is, a group whose role was mainly the delivery of goods and services.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> While this role as social and economic mediators was clearly defined during the Middle Ages, the beginnings of the modern era witnessed the rise of a questioning of their function within European Society. Over the course of the centuries that followed, both Jews and non-Jews began to grapple with what it meant to belong and participate in a society. The birth of the "Jewish question" is to be found here.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> For Jews, the question entailed how to hold onto a religious tradition defined by an extraterritorial bind to written Jewish law that assured them their social function during the Middle Ages. For non-Jews, who were no longer dependent upon Jewish mediation, the Jewish question meant how to deal with a large cultural and religious minority in the face of pressures from the Church and state. </p>

<p>As the famous debate between Moses Mendelssohn and Christian Wilhelm von Dohm brought to the fore, the Enlightenment was infused with the Jewish question, and the Jewish question was infused with the Enlightenment.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> This reciprocal interaction was crystallized following the French Revolution when citizenship was detached from religious belonging. In France, emancipation resulted in full&#x2014;although admittedly short-lived&#x2014;civil equality for Jews. While Jewish emancipation remained subject to contestation and debate during this period, reforms ebbed and flowed throughout the nineteenth century with regard to Jewish civic equality.  </p>

<p>With the redefinition of the role of Jews in European society and the granting of civil rights, the tension between a commitment to Jewish cultural memory and the demands of acculturation as a condition of social integration became steadily accentuated. Perhaps the best exemplar of this tension can be seen in the life and work of Heinrich Heine. Born to an acculturated German-Jewish family, Heine decided to convert to Christianity in 1825 in the hope of receiving his "ticket of admission to European society."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> Soon after, Heine realized that even baptism could not resolve the Jewish question. As he lamented to his friend Moses Moser in October 1826 while traveling to the North Sea: "It is very clear to me that I am most longingly forced to say goodbye to the German fatherland. Less the desire to wander and more the torture of my personal circumstances (that is, the Jew that can never be washed away [<i>die nie abzuwaschende Jude</i>]) drives me away &#x2026; For how deeply rooted is the myth of the eternal Jew! [<i>der Mythos des ewigen Juden</i>]."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> Heine spent the rest of his life in exile. His work is marked by a sense of radical ambivalence: No longer part of the Jewish religion but also scarcely welcomed as a participant in European civil society.  </p>

<p>The rise of race-based nationalism in the late nineteenth century brought a new dimension to the struggle of Jews to redefine their place in European society: the birth of modern anti-Semitism. In Western Europe, nationalism was often coupled with a rejection of the non-ethnic other, the Jew. In Central and Eastern Europe, Jews faced waves of pogroms that led many to define themselves nationally in order to resist the surging violence. A Jewish intellectual in this period faced a more or less set slate of options ranging from embracing a modern form of nationalism (Zionism) 

<b></b>

 to pursuing a cosmopolitan, universalist worldview (often of Leftist orientation), in which little room was left for conventional forms of Jewish identity. Born in 1873 into a traditional Jewish family and witness to the sufferings of Jewish life in Eastern Europe, Haim Nahman Bialik funneled his energies into becoming the first modern Hebrew national poet. Bialik's modernist poetry was infused by Russian Symbolism, nationalist outrage, and the richness of the Jewish cultural archive. On the other side of the continent, Sigmund Freud, never ignoring his Jewish upbringing, analytically dissected and re-construed the anthropology of religion. Moses' Jewishness became a cipher for human culture as such. In the spectrum of possibilities, one should not forget the choices made by res such as Walter Rathenau (1867&#x2013;1922), a politician and effusive writer, who fully embraced German nationalism; or Else Lasker-Sch&#x00FC;ler (1869&#x2013;1945) whose poetry amalgamated Christian mysticism with Jewish symbology; or Isaac Babel (1894&#x2013;1941), the voice of revolutionary universalism that becomes transformed into an ironic-reflexive stance. </p>

<p>In all of these res, we can detect a persistent tension between a historical consciousness and the Nietzschean "Now" that pleads for an unconditional concentration on the present while questioning a historical reverence to the past. This tension is the point of departure for the investigation of Jewish modernism in this volume. Building upon the extensive body of scholarship dedicated to the Jewish contribution to modernism, we want to examine some of the ways in which Jewish modernists negotiated this paradigmatic tension. We come to this topic from a distinctive theoretical strain, which might best be unfolded by revisiting Paul de Man's famous meditation on "Literary History and Literary Modernity."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> De Man argued that "to write reflectively about modernity leads to problems that put the usefulness of the term into question" because the very "spontaneity of being modern conflicts with the claim to think and write about modernity."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> That is, modernism's focus on the Nietzschean Now seemingly stands in contradiction to historical reflection. In the context of literature and philosophical writing by Jews, the tension between the "presentness" of modernism (and, indeed, of the modern era) and a culture of memory, which is, by definition, retrospective, seems all the more acute.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In soliciting essays for this volume, we asked the authors to go beyond what major scholars already achieved with regard to the 'Jewish contribution' to modernity: the genealogical tracing of individual Jewish contributions to the modern canon, the discussion of the tension between tradition and the modern, and the examination of elements of Jewish identity in the work of Jewish modernists. Instead, we wanted to raise more comparative, theoretical questions.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> The authors who participated in this volume are giving answers to the following kinds of questions: Is there such a thing as Jewish modernism&#x2014;whether conceived as a distinctive cultural-historical strain, the employment of certain aesthetic and poetic devices, or a kind of attitude or approach to thinking about the relationship between historical consciousness and the Nietzschean "now"? How can we redefine and re-historicize the very concept of Jewish modernism without falling back on either essentialist "Jewish" traits or essentialist "modernist" motifs?<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> What kind of specific methodological challenges arise in attempting to write about and historicize Jewish modernism? 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>Of course, the attempt to characterize both the "Jewish" in modern literature and the "modern" in Jewish literature is not new. The recent contributions by Ruth Wisse and Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi might, for example, productively summarize the state of the field. Wisse specifically asks what makes a book "Jewish"? She investigates the emergence of a multilingual, multinational "Jewish literature [that] violates, on the one hand, the concept of a national literature in a national language and, on the other hand, the traditional Jewish concept of a received literature that alone requires ongoing interpretation" (Wisse, xv). She convincingly argues that "modern Jewish literature is the repository of modern Jewish experience. It is the most complete way of knowing the inner life of the Jews" (Wisse, 4). For her, the most complicating feature of modern Jewish literature is its "relation to language" (Wisse, 5). She is thus less interested in the reverberation of the philosophical or aesthetic dimensions of modernism and more interested in how Jewishness is expressed in literature written by Jews. Referring to much of the same canon of Jewish writing, Ezrahi investigates the persistent topos of exile and homecoming in modern Jewish experience as it becomes reflected and refracted in the literary imagination. While viewing the experience of exile and homelessness as a fundamental part of the modern experience, Ezrahi cogently shows how Jewish authors internalized and expressed this problematic.  </p>

<p>In this volume, we sought to expand upon the range of questions, contexts, and themes through the integration of a variety of recent theoretical approaches to historicizing and conceptualizing modernism and modernity. Such approaches include the discussion of the tensions between philosophy and literature, the analysis of the fault lines between the modern and the postmodern, the mapping of transnational modernisms, and the status of visuality and textuality in a culture of memory. Rather than approaching Jewish modernism from within the context of the canon of Jewish modernism, we ask: How would Jewish modernism appear through the broader lens of modernist production? How would our image of modernism change if we were to include authors and writers often seen as "Jewish" as centrally expressing "modernism"? To this end, and in dialogue with the work of Chana Kronfeld and Michael Gluzman, we are interested in recasting the role of Jewish writers as crucially co-shaping our understanding of what modernism is.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> As Kronfeld argues, modernism often admired and even emulated 'the marginal' yet much of the scholarly apparatus that deals with modernism has tended to focus on national European languages (mostly English, French, German and Italian) while other languages and cultures in which important modernist works were written, such as Yiddish and Hebrew, have been comparatively neglected. Following Kronfeld and Gluzman, Uri Cohen's essay in this volume raises the question: Can we understand the death of the narrator in Agnon's <i>A Guest for the Night</i> from within the trajectory of modern Hebrew literature <i>and</i> through an examination of the broader, modernist obsession with death, such as in the works of Rilke, Heidegger, and Blanchot? To be sure, death in Agnon&#x2014;as the very condition for the emergence of a vibrant Hebrew literature&#x2014;relates to both the devastating external pressures on Jewish culture and the very physical existence of Jews in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14"> 14</a></sup> And, at the same time, Agnon's ration of death reflects his 

<b></b>

 ongoing engagement with Jewish historical sources from antiquity though the Middle Ages. Following Cohen, we seek to expand upon this approach to Jewish modernism by examining the possibility that Agnon's Jewish and perhaps Zionist ration of death (that is 'the particular') must also be understood through its participation in the much broader context of modernist writing and thought: How would our understanding of symbolism or existentialism change by including Agnon, a writer whose work is fully immersed in Jewish liturgy and thought and who 'appropriated' the modernist fascination with death? <i>And</i> how does our understanding of Agnon's "Jewish" approach to death change once we read his ration of death through the lens of existentialism? Can we read S. An-sky (as Gabriella Safran does) both within the context of his biographical Jewish background <i>and</i> through the lens of European primitivism? How do An-sky's ethnographic sketches shed new light on the history of primitivism, a fundamental topos of modernism? Instead of just understanding An-sky within a gallery of res stemming from Yiddish modernism such as Sholem Aleichem or S. Y. Abramovitsh, Safran places An-sky within the epistemological landscapes of ethnography and the fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle fascination with exoticism, two horizons that preoccupied transnational modernisms from Russian Symbolism to Cubism.  </p>

<p>It is in this way that we want to problematize modernism and modernity from both directions. We believe that our understanding of Jewish modernism stands much to gain if we see it as a determining facet of modernism as such; we also contend that our understanding of modernism itself would become richer if we think of its artistic and critical production as extending far beyond the territorial limits of canonical languages and cultures.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> Can Mahler or Sch&#x00F6;nberg's music, for example, be considered as operating within the conventions of post-Wagnerian European music <i>and</i> within the traditions of Rabbinic liturgy? Did Mahler's integration of non-classical, Jewish motifs into his symphonies result in opening up new vistas to contemporary modern composers? What would happen to the study of modern Jewish writing once we move beyond both canonical and conventionally commemorative approaches to organizing Jewish literature? What new vistas might appear if we were to read the poetry of Avot Yeshurun (1903&#x2013;1992), in which he mourns the loss of his hometown of Krasnystaw in the Ukraine, together with Derrida's meditation on "monolinguism" or Kurt Schwitter's "Ursonate" as examples of transgressions of syntax, grammar, and normative speech&#x2014;all things that were emblematic of modernism? What would happen if we neither delimited him to nor extracted him from the Jewish context? After all, the "peeping" of Josephine&#x2014;Kafka's famous mouse-singer&#x2014;cannot be restricted to modern music <i>nor</i> to the domain of the sounds of shtetl. This is because Jewish writers and artists worked both within the Jewish cultural tradition (what one could call with de Man "reflexivity") and the Nietzschean Now, in which art was invested in the promises and catastrophes of the modern as we find it in Joyce, Eliot, Mann, Picasso, and others. The study of Jewish literature and culture as well as the study of modernism stand to gain by this double de-territorialization: The modern is no longer seen only through the "masters" of modernism, and the Jewish is no longer seen as merely reactive, self-contained, or a subset. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Indeed, this is the approach taken by Barbara Mann and Todd Presner in their respective contributions to this volume. Building off the work of Kronfeld and Gluzman, Mann marks out the "vision" of Hebrew modernism through a constellation of texts and images drawn from the period of high modernism. Focusing centrally on the poetic work of David Fogel, she finds a "Fogelian passage" in his literary modernism, which not only accords with C&#x00E9;zanne's artistic practice of manipulating surface/depth relations but also opens up many of the same "Bergsonian" questions of memory, temporality, and subjectivity explored by the likes of Rilke, Mandelstam, Bialik, and Woolf. Using a different trove of cultural sources, Presner explores a quintessential modernist mythology&#x2014;namely, flying and aviation fantasies&#x2014;in the context of Jewish "body culture" and its hopes for corporeal regeneration. Situating his analysis around World War I, the catastrophe at the heart of much of the modernist imaginary, Presner analyzes the transformation of the Jewish body from a body of "muscle" into a body of "steel." Expanding on his cultural history of the re of the "muscle Jew,"<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> Presner shows how the Great War became the proving ground for Jewish masculinity and how Jewish aviators embodied, however fleetingly, the modernist mythology of flight in all its dialectical manifestations of nationality and war, muscularity and militancy, heroism and conquest.  </p>

<p>What happens to this cultural history and set of analytical questions after the Holocaust, that is after the effects of modernity's technological advancements took (at least in some cases) the shape of a myth centered around technology and transformed the ideas of the Enlightenment into a religion of reason? What implications did the mythical responses to the fears engendered by and symptomatic of modernity have for post-War art and literature? What was the effect of the murderous elimination of Europe's Jewry on the very ability of artists to create, and how did this 'event' co-shape the ostensible divide between the modern and the postmodern? Derek Schilling's examination of Georges Perec's "cult of memory" provides us with ways to concretely answer these kinds of questions. Schilling reexamines some of the structuring assumptions built into historiographies and anthologies of contemporary Jewish literature using the prose of Perec. Not unlike Edmond Jab&#x00E8;s' highly poetic abstractions of spatiality, Perec's poetics of anamnesis cannot be easily absorbed into accounts that restrict Jewishness to thematic approaches, historical periods, or essentialist geographies. Perec's "Jewish" prose opens up a "belated modernism," which is both temporally and spatially distinct from the traditional epicenters of high modernism.  </p>

<p>As if to sum up the stakes of the entire volume, Scott Spector echoes in his essay the widely discussed question, what does it actually mean to talk about 'Jewish writing'?<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> He poses an unsettling counterfactual reflection: What would modernism look like without Jews? Take res such as Kafka, D&#x00F6;blin, Benjamin, and Rosenzweig out of the equation and, Spector rejoins, you'll see. The result of his proposition and of the essays presented here, when taken together, is the creation of a new constellation that might help us to situate "an elusive object," which is not merely a body of work nor merely a register of authors but rather, as Spector writes, "a way of thinking about oneself and one's place in relation to the past, the future, and creativity." In this regard, 

<b></b>

 Spector's opening admonition is especially apposite here: "Jewish modernism" cannot be adequately elucidated by creating and analyzing a corpus of literature and art produced by people who happened to be Jews. Instead, by examining the reciprocal ways in which Jews participated in the project of modernity and the ways in which the hopes and catastrophes expressed in modernism co-shaped and continue to co-shape the Jewish condition, we can better understand modernity as such. After all, one can hardly understand the stakes of the journey of discovery undertaken by Christopher Columbus without taking into account the other, contemporaneous "journey" of the Jews out of Spain. As these essays bear out with impressive amplitude, Jewish modernism needs to be considered through the distinctive trajectories of Jewish history and culture as well as analyzed as an expression of the complexities and contingencies in the history of modernity itself. Indeed, neither can be disaggregated from the other.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT1" href="#REF1">1</a>. In his work on the conceptual history of "modernity" or "Neuzeit," Reinhart Koselleck entertains the question as to whether modernity is to be situated around 1500 or around 1800. Although, as he notes, the period around 1500 gave birth to a new world through the discovery of America, the emergence of global commerce, the invention of the printing press, and the scientific revolution in the wake of Copernicus and Galileo, the period around 1800 is the first one to identify itself "as the standard-bearer of a new time" characterized by the openness of the future and recognition of a new kind of temporal organization of the world. Koselleck does not, however, discuss what might be termed the dialectic of modernity, something that would have to be historicized in the period around 1500 and emblematically characterized by the discovery of America and the expulsion of the Jews. Cf. "The Eighteenth Century as the Beginning of Modernity" in: <i>The Practice of Conceptual History: Timing History/Spacing Concepts</i>, trans.

<p><a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>. While the concept of the dialectic of modernity accords with Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's famous analysis of the Enlightenment, we should bear in mind that there was no monolith of "modernity" or "Enlightenment" which led in an inevitable and all-consuming way to fascism. Instead, we must articulate the contingencies of modernity and the historical specificity of its progressive hopes and destructive nightmares.

Yael Lotan (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000) and <i>The Shadows Within: Essays on Modern Jewish Writers</i> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1987). Miron's work is seminal in its exploration of the cross-fertilization between modernism in the Yiddish tradition and the rise of modern Hebrew literature. See, for example, <i>The Image of the Shtetl and Other Studies of Modern Jewish Literary Imagination</i> (Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 2000) and his more recent attempt to rethink modern Jewish literature beyond the convictions of modern Hebrew literature in the first half of the twentieth century, specifically its belief in the superiority of nationalism as the only viable framework for the Hebrew imagination. See <i>Harpayah le-tsorekh negi'ah: li-kerat &#x00B7;hashivah &#x00B7;hadashah 'al sifruyot ha-Yehudim </i>[From Continuity to Contiguity: Towards a New Theorizing of Jewish Literatures] (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2005).

<p id="lead">The relation between text and image is one of the abiding tensions within modernism. It has found expression in myriad forms, from individual works of art, such as Pablo Picasso's cubist collages, to the more general interplay between literature and the fine arts, as well as that between writers and painters, such as Gertrude Stein and Picasso, to cite one well-known example. Furthermore, modernist literature often mimicked contemporaneous artistic modes in an attempt to produce the concrete materiality of painting in language, something that is conventionally considered a temporal medium. Indeed, modernism's interplay between literature and the fine arts may be understood as simply a continuation of the rivalry between the "sister arts," wherein the expressive effects of poetry and painting "competed" for aesthetic supremacy.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  G. E. Lessing's "La&#x00F6;coon: An Essay on the Limits of Poetry and Painting"  remains the most influential and systematic division of literature and painting in temporal and spatial terms. Poetry for Lessing was the genre that most closely approximated painting's material ability to represent the world in all its sensual detail. By contrast, neoclassical formulations of <i>ut pictura poesis</i>, a phrase originating with Horace, compared poetry to painting by way of the concept of voice, referring to them as "speaking picture" and "mute poetry."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Whether or not these critical judgments adequately define the full gamut of painterly and literary production, historically they have had enormous interpretive agency.  </p>

<p>Modernism's insistent and often complementary deployment of images and text seems, however, to be more than just the latest iteration of one of Western culture's essential divisions. The expressive efficacy of image as opposed to word, of body 

<b></b>

 as opposed to spirit, is at the very core of modernism's extended testing of the limits of representation. In this article, I contend that Jewish writers and artists had a special relation to this central tension within modernism, given the history of European Jewish culture and its normative prohibition on visual representation. This aniconic sensibility, deriving from the Second Commandment, "You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image," has been felt in various ways at different junctures in history across Jewish cultures.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Historically, a resistance toward visual or "pagan" representation has often been a barometer of Jewish-gentile relations, a way for Jews to set themselves apart from the larger, surrounding non-Jewish populations.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Broadly speaking, it has engendered a cultural tradition that is wholly bound up with the text, both in practical and in more esoteric senses. These traditional parameters had a profound influence on emergent forms of modern Jewish culture, be they secular literary genres, such as lyric poetry and novels, or the newly available realm of the fine arts. Indeed, since the <i>Haskalah</i> [Jewish enlightenment], attitudes toward the visual, both for and against, have underscored the general passage of traditional Jewish societies into secularism and modernity.  </p>

<p>Recent studies such as Richard Cohen's <i>Jewish Icons5</i> and the critical collection, <i>Jewish Identity in Modern Art History</i>,<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  have sought to overturn, and even displace, the normative view regarding the role, or lack thereof, of aesthetics within modern Jewish society and thought; these works describe with impressive intellectual rigor both the intensity with which Jewish cultures have produced visual artifacts and the tendentiousness of claims to the contrary. Scholars of religion such as Leora Batnitzky and Kalman Bland have contextualized normative assumptions regarding Judaism's antipathy to art within the ideological and philosophical interrogations of nineteenth century German Jewish intellectuals.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Bland sums up the field thus: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Aniconism was either a vice to be condemned or a virtue worthy of praise. Condemnation served the ideological needs of those who hoped to rid Europe of Judaism. Praise served the ideological needs of those who struggled to perpetuate assimilated Jewish life in the Diaspora. Regardless of their ideological motive, they agreed that Judaism was fundamentally aniconic.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Though the assumption "that Judaism was fundamentally aniconic" has now been conclusively debunked, its motivating power for modern Jewish culture should not be dismissed. Within modern Hebrew writing, the perceived stricture on visual representation found much thematic and stylistic expression.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Since its emergence in Eastern Europe in the early nineteenth century, Hebrew <i>belleslettres</i> had been intimately connected to the social, demographic and political sea-changes within traditional Jewish society, both reflecting and even shaping evolving notions of self, identity and nation. The presence and meaning of an aniconic sensibility (as described by Bland) thus red in Jewish cultural production, and was part-and-parcel of its discourse about becoming modern. While traditional Jewish identity had been tied, for better or for worse, to the text, new notions of the self could be imagined by way of an engagement with the visual. In some cases, this took the form of a newly felt relation to the natural 

<b></b>

 landscape; in other cases, it called for a renewed attention to the particulars of the human form.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In what I have elsewhere called "Jewish imagism,"<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  poets placed a premium on the poetic word as such and on stylistic practices that somehow produced the desired effects of the plastic arts. Jewish painters such as Moses Soyer and El Lissitzky displayed a particularly acute sensitivity to the role that language and text could play in the space of the canvas. Here, I focus on four paradigmatic individuals: two better-known res&#x2014;Marc Chagall (1887&#x2013;1985) and Osip Mandelstam (1891&#x2013;1938)&#x2014;whose work places them at the center, if there is one, of international modernism, and Chaim Nahman Bialik (1873&#x2013;1934) and David Fogel (1891&#x2013;1944), two Hebrew writers whose orthographic insularity has often isolated them from consideration within broader studies of modernism. Each re demonstrates a sensitivity to the tension between text and image, between word and picture. I begin with painting and a consideration of Chagall, whose polyphonic multiculturalism forms the backbone of his artistic world. The remainder of the article considers the work of poets, especially the challenge of secular literary production in the "holy tongue." Bialik was the central re of the Hebrew <i>Techiya</i> [Revival], a <i>fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle </i>cultural and literary renaissance that sought to shape a newly reborn sense of Jewish self and nation. Heralded as "the Hebrew national poet" shortly after the publication of his first poem "<i>El Ha-tsipur</i>" [To the Bird] , Bialik was a proto-modernist, whose linguistic inventiveness catapulted Hebrew poetic language into modernity; at the same time, and writing in a period of political and cultural revival, his work displayed an awareness of the limits of language, whether in personal communication or as a tool of nation-building. After examining Bialik's philosophies of language, I turn to the autobiographical work of Mandelstam. One of the founders of Acmeism (roughly, the Russian equivalent of Anglo-American Imagism), Mandelstam's work has only recently received focused attention within the rubric of Jewish culture.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  My reading of portions of his memoir, <i>The Noise of Time</i> , in relation to contemporary discourse on language and identity in Jewish culture will serve as a bridge to the lesser-known re of David Fogel. The meaning of Fogel's work will, I believe, be greatly enhanced by situating him squarely within international modernism. In Fogel's volume <i>Before the Dark Gate</i> , we find a resolution, of sorts, of Hebrew writing's historical "problem" with the visual. Though this is by no means an exhaustive account of how the text-image divide has manifested itself in works by Jewish writers and artists,<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  I hope the particular composition of this "quartet" will demonstrate what may be gleaned from viewing international modernism from one of its proverbial margins.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  </p>

<p class="continued">
By standing before nature and "dissecting" themselves with paint and brush, modern Jewish painters were acutely aware of the shape and shadow of the bookcase behind them. The self-portraits they created often reflected a tension between word and image. While this distinction characterized modernism generally, within Jewish creative expression it emblematized two ostensibly contradictory ideas about the self: an older, more text-adept self and a new self that was more at ease with visual forms and experience. Before addressing this sense of self in the work of Marc Chagall, I would like to look at one exemplary painting by Moses Soyer that directly thematizes our concerns, <i>The Lover of Books</i>  (<a href="#1">re 1</a>).  </p>

<p>Soyer and his twin brother Raphael, also a painter, were born in Russia in 1899, and immigrated to the United States in 1912. Both studied art in New York, and during the 1930s were involved in leftist political activity. Moses Soyer was associated with Yiddish cultural and political circles and was a member of the art committee of the World Congress of Jewish Culture.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  His "lover of books" stands in front of an enormous set of shelves filled with undecipherable and nameless matched sets, piles of folio-sized volumes; the books of the bottom shelf are especially crumbling and indistinguishable. Clutching a book and what appears to be a picture frame, a bearded, sage-like re in a formless coat, stares out of the painting, directly at the viewer, with a frank and slightly questioning gaze. Behind him on the wall and along the top shelf rest a collection of painted and sculpted res, whose styles span the entirety of Western art, from the classical bust on the left, through what appears to be a photograph of a dancing woman behind his left shoulder. The robed re hanging on the far right recalls a pious woman, perhaps a Piet&#x00E0;; the remaining two pictures&#x2014;one with an elaborate frame, the other barely indistinguishable from the wall behind it&#x2014;contain loose, abstract sketches of androgynous human forms. The painting's most detailed re&#x2014;the old man&#x2014;stands among these more-and-less finished portraits as another art object, something that is evident by the placement of his head and that portion of his torso rising above the shelf like a bust. Has the Jewish lover of books become, like the objects behind him, merely an object of historical interest, fit to be hung in a museum? He grasps both a large book and a picture frame. The book seems the size of an art folio, but it could just as well be a volume of the Talmud. There is, in this archetypal European Jew, more than a hint of Rembrandt's depictions of Dutch Jews and biblical scenes.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The insertion of this re, staring out from among the icons of Western art, is a kind of provocation; the painting asks the very same questions the youthful Russian painter El Lissitsky posed in 1923: how does the Jew fit into an aesthetic tradition dominated by classical, pagan, and Christian motifs? More importantly, how will Jews represent themselves? How will depictions of Jews by Jewish artists differ from those of Jewish subjects by non-Jewish artists?<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The question of self-representation was particularly acute for secular Jewish art and artists. While historically Jews had served as subjects for European painters, "[b]y creating their own artwork, Jewish artists in Russia brought to an end the monopolization by the Other of the visual definition of the Jews. Jewish artists asserted their own gaze, removing Jews from their marginalized condition by reading them into the center of their cultural representation."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Soyer's painting "asserts 

<b></b>

 the gaze of the Jew" by inserting this gaze into its very frame.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  At the same time the painting insists that the stubborn remnants of Jewish textuality remain inscribed within this newfound visual prowess. Judaism's abiding attachment to the text will continue to re in the Jew's self-representation, even if only as a faded and undistinguished backdrop. In the work of painters such as Marc Chagall, textuality proved an even more productive form of interference. </p>

<p>Chagall's <i>Self-Portrait with Seven Fingers</i> is an excellent example of a specifically Jewish textuality&#x2014;Yiddish language and literature&#x2014;troubling the ostensibly universal language of modernist art (<a href="#2">re 2</a>).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Painted in Paris in 1912&#x2013;13, this complex and provocative meditation on the painter's cultural origins powerfully asserts the Jewish artist's gaze. Like Chagall's other work from this period, <i>Self-portrait with Seven Fingers </i>is "an attempt to understand himself and to go back to his roots, to show the world where he came from, of Jewish and Russian provincial life."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Chagall places himself in the re of the painter at the center of his creative world, in a freewheeling, almost hysterically overdetermined fashion. The words Paris and Vitebsk, the latter being the painter's birthplace, float near the top of the painting's frame in Yiddish script. Paris is also graphically represented by a recognizable sketch from Chagall's own work, "Paris outside My Window," while Vitebsk is remembered as if in a dream for its small homes 

<b></b>

 and looming church steeple. The words are signs transmitting information, but they are also objects, whose shapes are significant in and of themselves; they become a part of the picture plane which is first and foremost, in Chagall's words, "a surface covered with representations of objects&#x2014;beasts, birds, or humans&#x2014;in a certain order in which anecdotal illustrational logic has no importance. The visual effectiveness of the painted composition comes first."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Textual interference in Chagall's work is also evident in the literalization of Yiddish idioms, a frequent practice which has been extensively described and debated by critics.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  To do something <i>mit ale zibn finger</i> [with all seven fingers] means to do it wholeheartedly, with all of one's faculties and senses, with the rational apparatus of the mind as well as the emotions.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The artist's body, in an acrobatic feat, both blends in with and mirrors the floor and easel. His body parts resemble the dabs of paint on his palette, which have already assumed a geometrical form of their own accord. The painter seems to become a part of his own work (the painting on the easel is <i>To Russia with Love</i>), while his body is transformed into the collection of shapes he paints: his 

<b></b>

 face, cut into a square, mirrors the shape of the canvas before him. The self is presented as a cognitive palimpsest of these textual and visual forms, of the past and the present, an amalgam of memories of Vitebsk and the seductive whirl of Paris outside his window. </p>

<p>No discussion of word-image relations in Chagall's work would be complete without some mention of his most complex melding of textual and pictorial reference, the ambitious <i>Introduction to the Yiddish Theater</i> , an auditorium-sized set of murals and paintings prepared for the debut of the Yiddish Theater in Moscow (<a href="#3">re 3</a>). The murals, which lay unattended for decades in storage in the former Soviet Union, have been the subject of a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York and several studies.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The mural allowed Chagall to work in the wide array of political and cultural discourses available to him: the international avant-garde, the embryonic Soviet culture, and the Jewish and Russian folk traditions. Traditional Jewish hermeneutics, epitomized by the dialogic openness of the Talmud in which competing views and typefaces co-exist on the same page, could also have served as a model.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The mural itself is a "chronotopic"<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  vision of the theater with liberal doses of Chagall's mythic biography, including the painter himself, delivered to the director Aleksei Granovksi by his patron, the art critic Abram Efros. Their names appear above their heads, like traditional Russian icons; Chagall's and Granovski's names, though in Hebrew letters, are written from left to right, as with Cyrillic or Latin letters. Hiding throughout the mural are numerous uses of actual words, particularly proper names: Chagall's family's names are embroidered onto the leg of the flute player, and those of the three classic Yiddish prose stylists "patched onto" the back of a performer's thigh. Traditional <i>klezmer</i> musicians appear against an abstract, spherical background, while theater performers, one wearing Jewish prayer straps, practice in front of a set of partial res.  </p>

<p>The stock elements of the Rabelaisian "world upside down" are present throughout the mural, including grotesquely deformed body shapes and distorted perspectives. The carnivalesque merges with another kind of site, what Benjamin Harshav describes as the "proverbial, mythical 'space,'" of the <i>shtetl</i>, "a collective locus of a network of social and ideological relationships wrought in the phraseology of Yiddish folklore and literature... This collective imaginary space was supported by a peculiar Jewish geography."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  In the mural, <i>shtetl</i> scenes, which are also references to Chagall's other paintings, bracket the theatrical world: against the left edge of the mural, a peasant plays a fiddle; the profiled positioning of his face and the cow's head recall the painter's famous <i>I and the Village</i> (1911&#x2013;12). On the mural's right edge, a man milks an upside down cow, below which a distorted fiddler plays while another re with clown-like pants urinates on a pig, defiling what is already profane.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  The multiple transgressions of this cameo image exemplify Chagall's sense of ownership vis-&#x00E0;-vis European culture as a whole, as well as his fidelity to the innately porous, variegated worldview allowed by the example of Yiddish, a hybrid and heterogeneous language par excellence. Indeed, these playful explorations of text and image, an essential component of Chagall's cultural milieu in both Paris and Moscow, were engaged with considerable more anxiety by modern Hebrew poets, given the direct, orthographic link of their work to Judaism's normative aniconic sensibilities.

2. Before the Bookcase: Bialik and the Limits of Modern Hebrew Writing
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Both Soyer's <i>Lover of Books</i> and Chagall's <i>Self-Portrait with Seven Fingers</i> foreground portraits of the self&#x2014;the aging lover of books and the grotesquely cubist young artist&#x2014; against representations of the past which are themselves informed by textual references. The uneasy relation between this textually-bound Jew and the world of aesthetics is most famously dramatized in Hebrew poetry in Saul Tchernichovski's "<i>Le-nokhach pesel apolo</i>" [Before a Statue of Apollo] : </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>I have come unto you &#x2014; do you know me?<br />
Here I am, the Jew: we have an eternal quarrel!..<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup></p>

<p class="continued">A contemporary of Bialik's, and the other central re of the <i>Techiya</i>, Tchernichovski was renowned for his treatment of classical themes, the integration of forms such as the sonnet into modern Hebrew, and his elaborate poetic meditations upon Jewish history and the place of the modern Jewish poet in a pantheistic world. "Before a Statue of Apollo" is Tchernichovski's most succinct poetic statement of Jewish culture's complex relation to the classical tradition. The poem claims, in part, that the speaker's devotion to Apollo is actually a "return" to long dormant, primal currents within Jewish culture. Though the poet was surely attuned to the irony of the poem's unusual address&#x2014;in Hebrew to a Greek statue&#x2014;the poem itself conres these worlds as firmly intertwined within the speaker's sense of self and cultural composition.  </p>

<p>Tchernichovski's work is replete with this sense of Jewish culture as merely one step in the evolution of world culture and motivated by a panoramic view of history as the progress of mixed cultures and belief systems. Therefore, when the poet asks if the statue "knows" him, he is also actually asking if the statue "recognizes" him, that is, remembers him from a time when they were not of seemingly inimical worlds. For Tchernichovski, this "return" to Apollo is firmly linked to the natural landscape, and to the childhood for which the poet nostalgically longs.

 </p>

<p>The tension between word and text is commonly thematized in Jewish modernist writing through a description of bookshelves, or the bookcase, before which the poet stands and rhapsodizes upon his relationship to Jewish tradition. The most famous Hebrew example of what Walter Benjamin called, with some irony, "the mild boredom of order"<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  imposed upon books, is undoubtedly Bialik's "<i>Lifney Aron Ha-sfarim</i>" [Before the Bookcase] . Bialik's generic inventiveness and expansiveness led him to create an oeuvre that included epic, historical poems, lyric love poems, natural odes, and what became known as "<i>shirey za'am</i>" [poems of wrath], wherein the poet castigated everyone&#x2014;Jews, gentiles and even God himself&#x2014;for the disastrous and often brutal state of Jewish life in Eastern Europe. "Before the Bookcase" was composed shortly after Bialik completed <i>Sefer Ha-agada</i> [The book of agada] a comprehensive compilation of Hebrew parables, folklore and other midrashic texts. Apparently this immersion in classical Jewish texts only reinforced for Bialik just how far he had drifted from traditional Jewish life. The poem's speaker resembles that of other poems that he composed, both thoroughly enmeshed in and alienated from the world of traditional learning. He recalls the "ancient scrolls" of his youth, asking: "Do you still know me? I'm John Doe!"  </p>

<p class="continued">In the poem's recognition scene, the speaker's desire to be "known" by this formative element of his childhood world exposes the distance between his former self and the present, between the religious, provincial environment of the Jewish shtetl, and the speaker's newly cosmopolitan self. The poem's rhetorical gesture is actually a kind of 

<b></b>

 doomed apostrophe since bookcases cannot "recognize" people, much less talk back to them. The mute presence of the dusty scrolls enables the poet to elaborate upon the twisting of his own identity, the "traces of [his] soul." Though the books in question as well as the poem itself are written in Hebrew, Yiddish was the language of instruction in the <i>cheder</i>, the setting for traditional Jewish learning in Eastern Europe. Thus lurking within the deep structure of Bialik's scene is the Yiddish distinction between two kinds of books: the Germanic <i>bikher</i>, a more general usage indicating secular books, and the Hebraic <i>sforim</i>, meaning religious texts only. <i>Bikher</i> were associated with the domestic world of "women and uneducated men," the officially designated audience of Yiddish books, while <i>sforim</i> emblematized the masculine world of canonical learning.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The terms also refer to two distinct but related semiotic realms within Eastern European Jewish life, itself composed of low and high cultures marked by linguistic difference.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Each language, and each set of texts, demanded a different kind of reading. Thus, the activity of <i>lernen</i> or <i>leynen torah</i> (to study or read Jewish law) constituted a particular kind of Jewish self, a male subject who was immersed and enmeshed in the text he studied. In contradistinction, the idea of <i>araynkukn in a bukh</i> (to browse or look at a secular book) implied another kind of self, one whose physical distance or separation from the text was indicated in the Yiddish verb <i>kukn</i> (to look). Bialik's speaker addresses <i>sforim</i> in "Before the Bookcase," but the poem effectively collapses the distinction between the two kinds of books; he looks at the <i>sforim</i> which no longer carry meaning for him, and they break apart, characterized only by their own pure, unintelligible materiality&#x2014;"like strands of black pearls, whose string was cut." </p>

<p>Both "Before the Bookcase" and "Before a Statue of Apollo" pin the identity of their speakers on the impossible recognition of silent objects, or rather, objects which "speak" only in metaphorical or mediated terms&#x2014;that is, books through a reading of their text, the statue through its resemblance to the human form. It is clearly the poet who does the talking, turning the silence of the bookcase and statue to his advantage. The difference between the poems would seem to be as simple as that between a poet who turns to a bookcase and one who turns to a statue for his sense of self. Yet the speaker of "Before the Bookcase" has turned away from these books; the poem describes the impossibility of his return. And if his relationship to the rows of text is rendered again and again in visual terms&#x2014;the "groping" or "dimmed" eye&#x2014;Tchernichovski's kneeling before the "god of wonder" also recalls the textual ties that bind, as the poem's last line refers to a pantheistic kind of desert god: "fettered&#x2026; with phylactery straps."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  On the one hand, these poems seem to offer diametrically opposed versions of a modern Jewish self, each resting on one side of the divide between textuality and visuality. On the other hand, this distinction is somewhat undone by the mutually imbricating relation of word and image in each poem.  </p>

<p>The shattering of meaning symbolized by the poem's images of a cut string and dispersed pearls is a central preoccupation of Bialik's <i>ars poetical</i> essays. These essays treat contemporary literary and social trends and hold ongoing significance for their conceptions of language and identity. They are essential both to a complete understanding of Bialik's work, and to the history of Hebrew poetry. "<i>Chevley Lashon</i>" [Language 

<b></b>

 pangs] , explicitly addresses the "birth" of a new national language, the passage of Hebrew from a largely written tradition of letters to the domain of secular literary genres and vernacular speech. This process was perceived as essential to the revival and survival of the Jews as a national entity. Bialik's essay pins the success of this project on the idea of language as either coinage to be passed between the poet and his audience, or property to be acquired, traded, accumulated, and re-circulated within the Jewish national audience. Beneath these empowering conceptions of language as capital, there is also a darker strain, particularly evident in the use of body imagery to illustrate the consequences of all this exchange: Language may become spoiled, contaminated or even "crippled" through this constant contact and usage within the public sphere.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>   </p>

<p>While Bialik was a proto-modernist in verse who largely wrote in classical forms, his essays engage with the modernist topos of the limits of language and the symbiotic relation between form and content. For example, in "Language Pains" he states that "[e]ven if words are nothing but 'vessels' for the concepts inside them, this very 'inner essence' always receives the form and shape of the vessel, like water in a glass."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  These formulations often employ rative language involving relations of surface and depth, or inner and outer states. "<i>Gilui va-kisui ba-lashon</i>" [Revealment and concealment in language]  details the different functions of language's inner and outer parts: the "shell" or "husk," appropriate for public usage, is linked to abstraction, mathematics and logic, while the inner essence is "the domain of poetry, the language of the individual soul."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  This essay also distinguishes the poet from the prose writer, comparing them to two people trying to cross a river. The prose writer crosses when the ice is frozen solid and is, therefore, blithely unaware of the dangerous depths below. The poet, however, "crosses the river as it is melting apart, upon its floating, wavering blocks of ice. He cannot leave his foot on one block longer than an instant, longer than it takes to leap from one block to the next, and so on. Between the gaps the abyss looms, the foot slips, the danger is near." The poet is characterized by a commitment to "the passing moment" and, therefore, must "flee from all that is fixed and still in language."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  In both images, the inner depths associated with the private, symbolic realm, are the poet's preferred territory. Paradoxically, these same "depths" are also inextricably connected to the more communal strata of language, precisely those layers of meaning through which the poem achieves its effects. The modernist challenge is to produce a similar result but through the inverse process&#x2014;that is, to make the surface itself highly meaningful.  </p>

<p>One brief example from Bialik's <i>oeuvre</i> will demonstrate how these two modes of representation might actually work in a poem.  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

<p class="continued">The poem's opening mood emerges from a purely sensual description of the movement of summer into fall. This effect is largely due to the treatment of color as essence, as a grammatical substantive. The gold, amber, and purple are initially represented as detached from the objects (the leaves) that they describe, much like looking at an impressionist canvas, in which one first sees blotches of color that only gradually cohere into rative form. This detachment of color and the stanza's awkward word order force the reader to build the verse from the color up into a comprehensible scene. Only the last line, with its hint of violence, suggests a conventional poetic reading of autumn, the paradoxical blaze of glory signifying death.  </p>

<p>The first stanza is the poet's "calling card" for the new Hebrew poetry, evidence that it can deploy the imagery and symbolism of European autumnal poetry. In the second stanza, the lone strollers are gathered up, eclipsed into a single giant eye yearning after many storks, who head for warmer climates while the strollers are stuck on their own in winter. The third stanza effectively abandons the romantic European model; its vernacular closing couplet evokes a deeper, communal strata: <i>bulbes</i> [potatoes in Yiddish], a nutritional mainstay for impoverished Jewish families in Eastern Europe, were featured in many Yiddish folk lyrics detailing life's hardships. The poem encapsulates the difficulties faced by both Hebrew and Hebrew language poets in becoming modern. I want to suggest here that the domain of the visual, in this example evoked through the use of color as an object, offered one way of making this passage.  </p>

<p>Finally, Bialik's essays reveal a growing frustration with regard to the representational limits of language, and its tendency to stand between the self and the world:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>For it is clear that language with all its associations does not introduce us at all to the inner area, the essence of things, but that, on the contrary, language itself stands as a barrier before them. On the other side of the barrier of language, behind its curtain, [stands] the spirit of man stripped of its husk of speech, only eternal chaos... The word is a tapestry of the void (<i>rikmat ha-tohu</i>). Just as physical bodies become sensible to the eye and definite in their borders in their blockage of the light, so the word acquires its existence precisely in that it clogs the small aperture against this same void and blocks its darkness, so that it won't well up, pervading and blurring its boundaries.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In this passage, the word is no longer "hard currency" grounding some stable economy of the self, but tenuously fabricated, woven from the "void." In fact, the Hebrew term here is from the description of chaos in the <i>Book of Genesis</i> as "unformed and void." 

<b></b>

 This fabric of nothingness only becomes substantial when exposed to light, and to the scrutiny of the human eye. This same visualizing process gives form to the word, which then acts as the only material means of preventing an overflowing of the void and a dissolution of the self. The conundrum upon which the passage stumbles is this: Does language "enlighten" by introducing us to knowledge of the world, or does it blind us to it? The formulation perhaps errs in conceptualizing the two as separate entities to begin with, in believing the world to be something "out there" that can be comprehended apart from language. Bialik's awareness of this impasse is also the source of the passage's extreme syntactical difficulty&#x2014;is the void inside or out?&#x2014;and its vacillation between tropes of language or speech and vision. Language is, after all, that strange phenomenon which seems to begin inside the self, but has its greatest, material consequence externally, in relation to others&#x2014;hence, the passage's painfully palpable sense of the self as a surface, an aperture upon and through which language plays. The idea of surface as an expressive vehicle was at the heart of modernism's visual revolution, and is also central to Fogel's imagist project. Before turning to a discussion of Fogel's poetry, however, I will consider the re of Osip Mandelstam. How might we uncover the presence of the text-image divide in the work of a Jewish poet who not only wrote in Russian, but became a baptized Christian? Oddly enough, Bialik's bookcase as well as his fear of language's proximity to the chaotic void provide ample context. </p>

<p>The interpenetration of textual and visual registers, incipient in Bialik and Tchernichovski, became paramount for later Hebrew modernist writing devoted to poetic worship of the image. Contemporaneous manifestos of Anglo-American imagism and Russian acmeism<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  called for a replacement of subjective, mood-oriented dreaminess with a commitment to craft, precision and the symbolic value of "small, dry things."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  One account described the change in this way: the Acmeists "continued the Symbolists' focus on artistic technique, but produced not so much melodious lines, a musical effect, as the pictorial, graphic clarity of visual images"<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Ezra Pound draws the same distinction between music and sculpture in a 1914 manifesto: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is a sort of poetry where music, sheer melody, seems as if it were just bursting into speech.</p>
<p>There is another sort of poetry where painting or sculpture seems as if it were "just coming over into speech."</p>
<p>The first sort of poetry has long been called "lyric"....</p>
<p>The other sort of poetry is as old as the lyric and as honorable, but, until recently, no one has named it. Ibycus and Liu Ch'e presented the "Image."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This postimpressionist revolt against symbolism generally looked to the plastic arts for <i>ars poetical</i> inspiration, a transition described with characteristic precision by Mandelstam himself as "the neo-classical shawl turned to stone."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Thus, like his Anglo-American contemporaries, Mandelstam's early volumes <i>Stone</i>  and <i>Tristia</i> 

<b></b>

  drew extensively on materials from the visual and plastic arts. References to Jewish roots are oblique in these early writings; though the poet perceived his cultural heritage as "chaotic," he resists identifying it specifically as Jewish in his early work. As Clare Cavanagh notes, he seems unaware of "the larger Jewish 'tradition' of self-creation in which he and his poetic project participate."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Mandelstam's poems that evoked Jewish themes often did so in opposition to a preferred "Hellenic" worldview, similar to the tension sketched in Tchernichovski's address to Apollo. Mandelstam's relation to Christianity is also complex: his conversion seems equally a matter of cultural self-fashioning, and the result of a practical desire to circumvent Jewish quotas at institutions of higher education. Jewishness in the early work thus operated either "in disguise" or as the device through which the poet will "enter the portals of Christian culture."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  However, the prose of the middle to late 1920s, collected under the title <i>The Noise of Time</i>, demonstrated "a concerted effort to reconcile his Jewish heritage with his quest for world culture, on the one hand, and his struggle to place both himself and his culture in relation to the new Soviet state, on the other." It is as if, in Cavanagh's moving terms, "his Jewish past followed him into the non-Jewish 'home and family' he attempted to construct for himself in Russian and European literature."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  I focus here on the poet's rendering of this Jewish past within the context of contemporaneous discourse on visuality, Jewish identity, and Hebrew and Yiddish writing.  </p>

<p>The essays of <i>The Noise of Time</i> repeatedly describe the poet's early exposure to language specifically within the parameters of a Jewish setting, what he calls "the Judaic chaos," "the unknown womb world whence I had issued, which I feared.... The chaos of Judaism showed through all the chinks of the stone-clad Petersburg apartment: in the threat of ruin, in the cap hanging in the room of the guest from the provinces, in the spiky script of the unread books of Genesis, thrown into the dust one shelf lower than Goethe and Schiller, in the shreds of the yellow ritual."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  In the spirit of the acmeist commitment to "the word as such" and the simplicity of "A=A,"<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  the Jewish world of Mandelstam's childhood is rendered primarily through objects and fragments. Books are simply another kind of object, to be feared for their biblical "spiky script," or forgotten under the dust. For Bialik the fact that tradition has ceased to signify&#x2014;books no longer recognize him&#x2014;precipitates an existential trauma, while for Mandelstam this same situation simply provides another opportunity to practice "the sharp edge of Acmeism."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  This idea is elegantly conveyed in Mandelstam's vivid memory of the family bookcase. His description bears an uncanny similarity to that of Bialik's poem and Soyer's painting with regard to the bookcase's physical description as well as its formative importance for the poet's emerging artistic self: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The bookcase of early childhood is a man's companion for life. The arrangement of the shelves, the choice of books, the colors of the spines are for him the color, height, and arrangement of world literature itself ... Every book in the first bookcase is, willy-nilly, a classic, and not one of them can ever be expelled ... There was nothing haphazard in the way that strange little library had been deposited, like a geological bed, over several decades. The paternal and maternal elements in it were not mixed, but existed separately, and a cross section of the strata showed the spiritual efforts of the entire family, as well as 

<b></b>

 the inoculation of it with alien blood. I always remember the lower shelf as chaotic: the books were not standing upright, side by side but lay like ruins: reddish five-volume works with ragged covers, a Russian history of the Jews written in the clumsy, shy language of a Russian-speaking Talmudist. This was the Judaic chaos thrown in the dust ... This was the level to which my Hebrew primer, which I never mastered, quickly fell ... The Hebrew primer as illustrated with pictures which showed one and the same little boy, wearing a visored cap and with a melancholy adult face, in all sorts of situations&#x2014;with a cat, a book, a pail, a watering can. I saw nothing of myself in that boy and with all my being revolted against the book and the subject &#x2026; Above these Jewish ruins there began the orderly arrangement of books; those were the Germans ... the old Leipzig and Tubingen editions, chubby little butterballs stamped in claret-colored bindings ... All this was my father ting his way as an autodidact into the German world out of the Talmudic wilds ... Still higher were my mother's Russian books&#x2014;Pushkin in Isakov's 1876 edition ... The color of Pushkin? Every color is accidental&#x2014;what color could one choose for the purl of speech. Oh, that idiotic alphabet of colors by Rimbaud...!<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Mandelstam's elaborate description underscores the variety of cultural alternatives available to the emergent Eastern European Jewish intelligentsia. The bookcase&#x2014;a metonymy for the canon&#x2014;is the site of a stratified intellectual hybridity, shot through with "alien blood." Knowledge is understood in gendered terms, either maternal or paternal in origin, but never both. In contrast to Bialik's religious "scrolls," the specifics of Mandelstam's "Judaic chaos" are examples of secular literature: a history book and a Hebrew schoolbook. His estrangement, however, from the "Jewish ruins" is absolute, and articulated in relation to his parents, themselves Central European immigrants who had adopted the Russian language and culture. The poet's embrace of his mother's culture is specifically related to language. As he describes her "sonorous Russian": She was "the first of her whole family to achieve pure and clear Russian sounds"; "[h]er vocabulary was poor and restricted, the locutions were trite, but it was a language, it had roots and confidence." His father, by contrast, "had absolutely no language; his speech was tongue-tie[d] and languagelessness.... A completely abstract, counterfeit language, the ornate and twisted speech of an autodidact, where normal words are intertwined with the ancient philosophical terms of Herder, Leibniz, and Spinoza, the capricious syntax of a Talmudist, the artificial, not always finished sentence: it was anything in the world, but not a language, neither Russian nor German."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>   </p>

<p>We can intuit Mandelstam's <i>ars poetical</i> leanings in the preference for a simple, rooted language, and in the free-floating importance of color throughout the description of the bookcase. The beginnings of Mandelstam's own penchant for German and Russian classics is also evident here, while the Acmeist insistence on language's visual, material qualities&#x2014;the "color of speech," the "alphabet of colors"&#x2014;acquires a domestic setting, at once both Russian and Jewish. His description of this primal scene is informed both by an essential bond between Jewish culture and textuality and an uneasy sense of the inadequacy of this link in contemporary times. Mandelstam therefore renders the bookcase in visual, sensual terms&#x2014;through color, texture, and even taste and scent, such that the spatial arrangement of books on shelves repeats the conventional opposition between Semitic chaos and Classical order. While Bialik remembers himself as a boy 

<b></b>

 in <i>cheder</i>, it is only the pictorial image of such a boy that most firmly engraves itself in Mandelstam's memory. The power of this visual image may also lie beneath the poet's visceral reaction to the Jewish State Theater of Moscow, whose performances he saw with Simon Mikhoels in Kiev in 1926. While wandering through the "oldest, most indomitable city in the Ukraine," Mandelstam noted that in "a basement synagogue" there were "a hundred venerable old men in striped <i>talesim</i> [prayer shawls] seated like schoolchildren behind narrow yellow desks&#x2026;. If only Chagall were here!"<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Mandelstam's memory of language as male and female rings thoroughly of the <i>bikher-sforim</i> division discussed above in relation to Bialik: "The speech of the father and the speech of the mother&#x2014;does not our language feed throughout all its long life on the confluence of these two, do they not compose its character?"<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  Indeed, his claim that "[i]n my childhood I absolutely never heard Yiddish" should be treated with some skepticism.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Although his mother had mastered Russian, the "official" and therefore "masculine," vernacular, his father remained anomalous and utterly marginal, an example of someone who failed to find the ultimate canonical language, namely philosophy. Mandelstam's memory also displays an interesting penchant for an inversion of Jewish culture's "high" and "low" semiotic realms. In Mandelstam's bookcase, the father's <i>sforim</i> (Hebrew and German) occupy the bottom shelves while the mother's secular Russian <i>bikher</i> are placed above. His father's speech is paradoxically both denigrated (tongue-tied, counterfeit) and elevated (abstract, philosophical), while his mother's language is "poor" yet linked to the "literary Great Russian language."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  This division precisely describes the advantages and disadvantages facing modernist Hebrew and Yiddish writers: One language offered the authoritative burden of an ancient tongue; the other was a supple vernacular with links to the wide flow of daily life. The articulation of these bonds between language, identity, and Jewishness within Mandelstam himself, perhaps the most adamantly "worldly" of modernist Jewish poets, demonstrates the tenacity of their claims upon the Jewish writer.  </p>

<p>Thus far we have seen how for Jewish artists from Soyer to Bialik and Mandelstam, the bookcase symbolized a bifurcated vision of the modernist self. Even more fundamentally, however, the tension between word and image, as evidenced in Bialik and Mandelstam, exemplified both modernism's and modern Judaism's struggle with representation. The work of Kafka, and perhaps also of Proust, each in its own way, probed this difficulty within modernism's more canonical languages. David Fogel, an aspiring Hebrew writer working on the edges of European centers of literary and artistic creation, was keenly attuned to the power of a more material poetics, a poetry of collage, the fragment, and colloquial language. In his work we can find a radical rebellion against Judaism's normative prohibitions on visuality, and a consequently fuller deployment of Hebrew as a modern literary vernacular. </p>

<p>For the past decade or so, the modernist Hebrew and Yiddish writer David Fogel (1891&#x2013;1943) has drawn an increasing amount of critical and scholarly attention.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  His impressionist, erotically-charged prose fiction, despite its often idiosyncratic and unconventional (for its time) subject matter and voice, may nevertheless be read as part of the general evolution of modern Hebrew literature as a vehicle of secular self-expression. His slim poetic output, consisting of a single volume of Hebrew verse published in Vienna in 1923, and a somewhat larger body of posthumously published work,<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  served as belated inspiration for a later generation of Israeli poets, who delighted in the poetry's spare minimalism and strange interior landscapes. A collection of prose published in 1990, including evocative selections from Fogel's early diaries, and the translation of a sprawling Yiddish novel based on his wartime experiences in France, only further deepened critical appreciation of this unique writer.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Fogel himself was murdered in Auschwitz, one of the last modern Hebrew writers on European soil.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Though scholarly treatments have diverged over the ideological and political meaning of his <i>oeuvre</i>,<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  there is now general agreement regarding its essential place in any account of modern Hebrew literature. </p>

<p>It has become a commonplace within Fogel criticism to remark upon the "colorful" quality of the poet's work, that is, the abundance of color references in his poems.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Indeed, the relation between color and language has fascinated modernist poets and critics alike, and it is at the core of Rainer Marie Rilke's passionate reaction to C&#x00E9;zanne work in 1907, recorded in his <i>Letters on C&#x00E9;zanne</i>. The collection remains one of modernism's quintessential statements on the complex relationship between poetry and painting. In Rilke's view, C&#x00E9;zanne's "painting is something that takes place among the colors, and how one has to leave them alone completely, so that they can settle the matter among themselves. Their intercourse: this is the whole of painting."<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  For C&#x00E9;zanne, it was precisely the point that paint could be both color and object&#x2014;the signifying medium itself, revealed in thick or patchy brushstrokes, as well as the fruit in all its unnerving, quivering realness on the canvas. In other words, paint retained its ability to represent the world, while "baring the device," flaunting the mechanism through which representation achieves its results. The tension between the two, what made C&#x00E9;zanne's work so exemplary for Rilke, is most acutely felt in the attention to surface, where the plane of the canvas is forced to carry the full weight of a scene's depth. Though this may be a truism for painting generally, with C&#x00E9;zanne this tension is thematized and made the center of his artistic practice. C&#x00E9;zanne's work thus presented a huge challenge to other painters, and to writers as well. Perhaps more than any other Hebrew poet, Fogel met this challenge,<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  hence the often difficult abstraction of his poems. The concept of the C&#x00E9;zannian "<i>passage</i>" is a good metaphor for understanding how different layers of poetic space&#x2014;formal, linguistic and thematic&#x2014;interact in Fogel's work. <i>Passage</i> implies a manipulation of surface/depth relations, an elision of contour and boundary, and a privileging of the surface of the canvas. The practice of <i>passage</i> elevates color at the expense of form, making color the primary device through which painted objects coalesce before the viewing eye.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  <i>Passage</i> insists on the primacy of the human eye as the constructive agent of the scene. The viewer of a C&#x00E9;zannian 

<b></b>

 landscape is called upon to perceive this landscape from the painter's idiosyncratic point of view, to participate in its composition, compiling its elements in comprehensible fashion. The canvas may be perceived as a continuous whole, but is in fact only more gradually absorbed and made sensible. This is the work of <i>passage</i>, in the creation of the canvas as well as in its apprehension.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Fogel's poems also demand from the reader a participatory visualization, wherein the word is treated as a material object or substance, and its referential qualities become secondary.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  Poetry which strips language of its referential qualities&#x2014;in the case of Hebrew, its historical depth&#x2014;may be understood as a linguistic equivalent of modernist art's radical renovation of surface/depth relations.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  We find a call for just such an iconoclastic treatment of Hebrew in Fogel's "Language and Style in Our Young Literature" , a public lecture which was his only direct statement concerning the creation of a modern Hebrew literary idiom.<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  In Fogel's view, at the root of Hebrew literature's "complete anarchy" was an overly-deferential view of the Hebrew language, "that attraction to the holy tongue whose origins lie in the days of the <i>Haskalah</i>; this attraction unconsciously distorts our judgment when we come to read a modern Hebrew text: "[W]e still treat Hebrew as a holy thing... Our special attachment to the Assyrian script is the root of this trouble. We tend to judge leniently everything written in Hebrew, especially a work written in the ornate holy tongue that is full of lexical and expressive innovation."<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Hebrew's "linguistic material" presented particular problems to the modern writer, whose desire to shape it according to his own individual style was thwarted by Hebrew's abundance of classical authority. Yet it is precisely these deeply referential qualities that made Hebrew so valued a tool in national identity construction. Fogel's break with this tradition is effected in passing, almost casually, through the term "Assyrian," rendering Hebrew strange, removed from a solely or specifically Jewish/religious content, as just another Semitic language. The passage also reveals Fogel's sensitivity to language's most overtly visual facet&#x2014;its orthography. This material difference set Hebrew and Yiddish writing apart from European culture as a whole. Fogel's determination to "be European" in Hebrew seems almost a declaration: if Hebrew is truly the ultimate box for a modernist writer to find himself in, this is the kind of adventure that can be had in it. How does Fogel's "malnourished"<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  Hebrew find expression in the poems? And what kind of self emerges from Hebrew poetry when it is forcibly removed from "God's writing on the tablets" and rendered in plain "Assyrian script"?  </p>

<p>Answers to these questions can be gleaned from Fogel's signature volume, <i>Before the Dark Gate</i> , which explores the meeting of this "malnourished" Hebrew self with the landscape of <i>passage</i>. Contemporaneous critiques leveled against the book concerned the monotony of its lyrics. In Shlonsky's words: "Its outside: a black cover. And its inside: 'black closets,' 'black birds,' 'black ship'.... and night-night-night. Also father has a 'black coat' and 'his beard is black' etc."<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  Or Avigdor Hameiri's somewhat less scathing remembrance of his initial reaction to Fogel: Instead of telling a story about a landscape, he merely gives pictures of it.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  Two astute readers, Bialik and Asher Barash, both characterized the distinctiveness of Fogel's poetic achievement in terms of 

<b></b>

 the plastic arts: Bialik is said to have claimed that his poems reminded him of abstract painting,<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  while Barash noted their resemblance to metallurgy: "There is something in them not found in Hebrew poetry until now: a thin, silvered style, almost filigree."<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  All these reactions hint that the poems of <i>Before the Dark Gate</i> are meant to be looked at, even touched, as much as read. Both Bialik's and Barash's observations underline the material aspect of Fogel's poetic language&#x2014;that is, the propensity for formal, spatial relations implied in the reference to abstract painting, or the metaphorical comparison with filigree, a technique which preserves some of silver's molten dynamism within the finished object.  </p>

<p>The volume's overall structure is less dependent on thematic concerns and more organically related to the idea of <i>passage</i>.<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>  When reading the numbered poems in sequence, instead of focusing on their thematic situations, a fluidity of image seeps from poem to poem, creating not simply repetition, but a cumulative effect, akin to what Joseph Frank has called "spatial form."<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>  Each poem also works internally in a similar fashion. The Fogelian stanza is typically compact and self-contained, often consisting of a single sentence, with little enjambment. Enjambment would force the eye to read along the poem more strongly. Instead, the individual strophes pile up against one another, their concise, vivid images interacting along the axis of the poem as it unfolds down the page. The importance of physical surface for Fogel's poems is evident in the very infrastructure of their imagery, which is characteristically created through the meeting of spatial planes. Even intangible items become substantive by being laid upon or against something: "The desert afternoon's gold weighs silently/ on expanses of sand" and "Weary skies/ sweat palely/ upon the silence."<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>  Likewise, objects&#x2014;a dog, the speaker, a sun&#x2014;stand against a solid colored surface. This imagery also includes the interruption of a monolithic or monochromatic surface (silence or darkness) by another color or language. For example, Poem 41 describes the movement of "all the many moments of beauty,/ that have passed like pearl drops/ our dark lives."<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>  Similarly, in Poem 66: "passing images cast/ flashes of all the colors/ into our darkness."<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>  These images place a premium on fragmentation as an aesthetic value, even an expressive necessity, in the face of "things falling apart." The subjective process of perception is described through external ration; the self becomes a surface which acquires the world's markings. Indeed, the volume as a whole displays an ambivalence concerning interiority and external impressions, a confusion rendered through a proliferation of surface. Poetic <i>passage</i> is a means of managing this self which is caught in-between, neither wholly interior nor entirely dependent on external elements.<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>  The poems of <i>Before the Dark Gate</i> often record tightly-staged scenes of interiors and exteriors such as a room overlooking a street, high windows glimpsed from below, or a view from the edge of a city.<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>  The body is another surface whereupon the productive confusion of internal and external experience is made concrete. </p>

<p>All of this means that reading <i>Before the Dark Gate</i> entails intense visualization on the part of the reader, a process mimicking the physical relation implied by C&#x00E9;zannian <i>passage</i>. In sensing this relation, the gap between themselves and the poetry before them, Fogel's readers have also felt its strangeness, its "Assyrian script." The poems 

<b></b>

 resist reading, if by "reading" we mean a traditional, word-bound activity. Instead, they ask to be seen, to be comprehended through their visual cues and imagery. Reading poems 25 and 26 side-by-side provides an excellent illustration of how <i>passage</i> functions (see <a href="#app">appendix</a> for the full text of the two poems). The poems render complementary versions of the same situation: a woman longing for her lover. In Poem 25, the speaker is outdoors and mobile, in Poem 26, inside and stationary. Both scenes recall those portions of the biblical <i>Song of Songs</i> in which a female speaker longs for her beloved at night. <i>The Song of Songs</i> occupied a privileged position in the gallery of classical texts engaged by modern Hebrew poetry, not only for its semantic specificity and plentitude of terms relating to the human body and the natural world, but also for its densely textured allegory. The <i>Song</i> and its rich thematic and linguistic arsenal were an important part of any modern Hebrew poet's tool-kit. However, in keeping with his general disdain for Hebrew's classical cache, Fogel strips the biblical setting of this exemplary specificity, granting it generalized, surreal, almost gothic overtones. As Chana Kronfeld notes regarding another poem from this series, "[t]he only direct and unambiguous textual marker in the language of the poem that points to <i>The Song of Songs</i> is the word <i>dodi</i>."<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The poems should be "seen" as a series of clusters of colors and spatial relationships, which are reconred and re-emerge throughout the poems. Conventionally binary distinctions&#x2014;surface/depth, light/dark/, night/day, wet/dry&#x2014;are manipulated in such a way as to suggest the gradations of a palette rather than firmly oppositional categories. For example, Poem 25 opens with an ambiguous location&#x2014; "night's edge"&#x2014;a phrase which spatializes night by giving it a physical quality. The description of the speaker and her hair sweeping across her nightshirt is picked up in Poem 26 as "the night of my hair/ like a dark cascade" and the evening's "spread[ing] a black dress" as a kind of visual scramble of the colors and their motion in Poem 25. Imagery is formed through relations among solid objects and planes, the mixing of subject and object, woman and night. In perhaps the most delicately wrought cluster of images, Fogel's poems confound both physics and natural biology, turning solids into streams of light or air and rendering light what is normally dark. In Poem 25, the speaker's power is so great, her flesh blazes like a sun at night. In Poem 26, the sound of this blaze (LoHET) is echoed in the description of the speaker's torso as a gleaming flame (LaHEvET). In another series of surface-dependent imagery, water falls like light onto dark backgrounds: In Poem 25, the spring's waters murmur in the darkness, while in Poem 26, the speaker's legs are described as clear or bright "streams" in the dark, yet the final image is of tears. Elements of these clusters of spatial relations and color intertwine and overlap, just as <i>passage</i> operates in a painting.  </p>

<p>With this appreciation for Fogel's densely wrought imagery, we can return to the meaning of color in his work, keeping in mind the idea of color as symbolic of painting's desirable, non-referential qualities. Poem 26 is remarkable for having a color-related word in every stanza, except the single word "<i>bo'ah</i>" [come] in line 10. In a sense, the poem is constituted by these patches of color, given the numerical predominance of color vis-&#x00E0;-vis other semantic spheres.<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>  These patches nevertheless appear in a determined 

<b></b>

 sequence marked by verbs of progressive action: "come" (twice), "approach," "deepens" (in its imperfect progressive form), and the hypothetical future of the line "I [will] no longer see." Kronfeld has demonstrated how this use of shifting tense aspect, due largely to the "incompleteness within the Hebrew syntax of his time," perfectly serves Fogel's creation of an indeterminate state or mood, what she calls "a hesitation between impressionist, atmospheric shades of a discrete moment in space and time, and the expressionist, internalized reality of the speaker's state of mind."<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>  The tension between the poem's "hesitant" sequencing and its patches of color illustrates a general principle regarding the use of colors in <i>Before the Dark Gate</i>: Colors slow down the flow of things. The unusual forms of blue and black in Poem 25's first stanza, jammed up against one another, provide a concise example of this principle: "my wild hair/ sweeps black the blue of my nightshirt." Grammatically adjectives, they function syntactically as adverb and object. Their proximity on the line briefly reduces their syntactic function (the function determining flow or sequence). Color acts synchronically, mitigating against the diachronic sequence of the poem. Thus color, which played an important role in the passage from impressionism to expressionism in Fogel's work<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>  is simply the most readily recognized element of his poetry's larger concern with surface/depth relations. </p>

<p>Of course, any act of reading does a certain amount of violence to the text; any interpretation is a kind of reduction. These limitations of the interpretive act correspond to those inhering in the imaginative act, in the impossibility of grasping the whole of experience. There is something slightly reverential in the acknowledgment of this impossibility, as if to truly grasp the world would be to miss the point or to achieve something that is not poetry. It is therefore relevant that both Poems 25 and 26 describe the unfulfilled desire to be reunited with a lover; this circuit of loss is inscribed again and again throughout <i>Before the Dark Gate</i>. For if Fogel's poems are "about" anything, it is not the loss of the past (childhood, family, a former self) but the way the past refuses to stay put, that it is an invention of the present, however inadequate the imagination's attempts to give it shape.  </p>

<p>This interdependence of past and present is a key effect of poetic <i>passage</i>, and has ramifications beyond the personal past of the individual poetic speaker; indeed, Fogel's work critiques the retrievability of a collective past. Poetic <i>passage</i> works against Jewish history's meta-narrative of redemption which implies a forward, linear motion in time and space&#x2014;out of "Exile," as both historical period and geographic site, into the "Land of Israel." In contradistinction, Fogelian <i>passage</i> binds various moments in the poems together in order to "thicken" time. In art historical terms, Cubism represented the furthest extreme of this reification of time and the "culmination" of <i>passage</i>. This view of history has been astutely characterized by Wendy Steiner: "Cubism... tells us to think of history in a new way, not as plotted narrative moving toward a resolution, but as a cubist painting whose elements maintain their heterogeneity&#x2014;objects, people, things, signs; the banal, the dramatic; the contemporaneous, the anachronous&#x2014;in an aestheticized structure of interrelations."<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>  Of course this ahistoricized view is precisely why some critics lambasted modernism. Yet such a poetics does not necessarily imply 

<b></b>

 a negation of time's passage, simply a reevaluation of how time is experienced. Fogel's work approached a Bergsonian kind of perception that is closer to intuition than intellect: an "aesthetic mode of apprehension which involves a full physical and spiritual reaction to the things of the world, by which we place ourselves within the object of perception."<sup><a name="REF92" href="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>  For the poet this meant conceiving of the self in spatial terms, as a body in the world with a spacious interiority and the capacity to intuit the essence of the world's objects, a subjectivity at odds with the firm divide between human subject and natural landscape posited by enlightenment Hebrew poetry. This reconring of the self was achieved through an intense engagement with visuality and aesthetics. Fogel's radical re-visioning of Hebrew poetic language builds upon and moves forward from the proto-modernist word-image tensions in Bialik and earlier poets, who could only grapple with visual registers. In embracing such a poetics, Fogel's work forced Hebrew writing to participate in that revolution of human consciousness which Virginia Woolf claimed occurred in or around December 1910.  </p>

I. The Military Might of Old-New Maccabees
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p id="lead">At the end of the nineteenth century, when Max Nordau issued his call for the re-creation of a lost "muscular Judaism,"<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  there was probably no stereotype as deeply imprinted on the Jewish body as that of the cowardly and un-soldierly Jew. Because of their small chest size, their flat-footedness, their ungainly gait, their hunched-over backs, their susceptibility to certain diseases (diabetes, tuberculosis, alcoholism), their dietary restrictions, their inability or unwillingness to abandon the world of abstractions and speculations, and their inherent cowardice, Jews could never become good soldiers.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Their unfit bodies, cowardly psychic disposition, and religious-cultural strictures supposedly prevented them from defending the countries in which they lived, consigning them to "unheroic conduct."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In a scathing caricature from 1780, the year before Christian Wilhelm von Dohm published his famous treatise advocating, among other things, for the "military" improvement of the Jews, a Viennese caricaturist by the name of Johann L&#x00F6;schenkohl published an illustrated poem called "Jewish Recruits Complaining About Learning Military Drills."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Condensing virtually all of the anti-Semitic stereotypes of the un-soldierly Jew, the poem consists of a dialogue between a Jewish recruit named "Mauschel"<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  and a corporal who is overseeing his training. Mauschel says: "Look out, oh German world! Watch with wonder. We're going into the battlefield. Ach! Is this befitting? We have to become, all at once, a Mauschel and a soldier. We swear by our beards, the 

<b></b>

 heavens and the earth: It's not going to happen because we lack courage. And yet we're called upon to be warriors. &#x2026; We fear the smell of gun powder and the whistle of the bullets; we are so scared when the canons fire. Look at how deep it cuts to my heart when a great enemy stands before me &#x2026; Oi Vey, Mr. Corporal, I'm going to pee in my pants. Oi Vey, Mr. Corporal, listen to my screaming. Free me from this pain. Oi Vey! Oi Vey! Oi Vey!" [<a href="#1">re 1</a>]. </p>

<p>In a somewhat later caricature of a Jewish soldier, "Jacob as Recruit and Jacob as Poet," the physical inadequacies of the Jew come to the foreground next to his deep-seated cowardice [<a href="#2">re 2</a>].<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  When the diminutive Jacob, with flat feet and misshapen legs, cannot follow the commands of the drill sergeant&#x2014;"Left, right! Left, right!" &#x2013;, he asks: "Am I to blame for growing this way?" As the counterpart to the tall, muscular, serious, and erect standing German soldier, Jacob is small in stature, weak in physical composition, whimsical in demeanor, and downright terrified of his weapon. He cannot march straight due to his awkward gait; he does not know how to use his musket-bayonet; he falls prostrate on the ground in a plume of smoke. As the sergeant looms angrily above him, he cries out: "Ach! I'm dead. I'm kaputt." The final scenes show Jacob, at home, ogling a girl from his window and sitting at his desk composing poetry. Military service, we are to conclude, is not a Jewish characteristic. </p>

<p>Since defense of the state demonstrated loyalty to the state, military service became connected to the debate over Jewish emancipation and the extension of civil rights throughout the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Of course, detractors found ample ammunition to bar Jews from serving in the military: Not only were Jews physically unfit for military service, they argued, but Jewish religious strictures, particularly the Sabbath and kosher dietary requirements, made them less than ideal candidates for ting side-by-side with their Christian counterparts in battle. But when Frederick William III signed the Edict of Emancipation in 1812, Jews were recognized for the first time as "Einlaender," or native Prussian state citizens, thereby rendering them "subject to military conscription."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  In fact, more than 700 Jews&#x2014;the majority of whom volunteered for military service&#x2014;fought for Prussia during the Wars of Liberation (1813&#x2013;15).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  After years of backlashes and modest gains, more than a thousand Jews fought for Prussia in 1866, prompting Theodor Fontane to remark that "it was as if they had vowed to put an end to the old notion that Jews are unwilling and unfit to t in war."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  About seven thousand Jews fought in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71 and hundreds were decorated, numbers that approximated the rate of service and decoration for the rest of the population.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Although there was a significant record of Jewish military service in German-speaking lands prior to World War I, the stereotype of Jewish physical inferiority persisted in equal measure. An anti-Semitic pamphlet, <i>Israel im Heere</i> (Israel in the Army), which was first printed in 1879, circulated widely at the end of the nineteenth century and resurrected many of the stereotypes of the Jewish body found in the caricatures created earlier.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The author maintained that since the Jews "lived off other people as parasites" , they have never had to defend the nations in which they resided. Citing Herder's assessment of their physical inferiority with approbation, Naudh writes that

 Jews "do not have the complement of muscles as Northern people, and they lack the firm sinews of Arabs. &#x2026; Their bones are not strong like those of the Germans &#x2026; their entire bone structure is defective; the chest is not broad and developed, the shoulders are not straight and level, the neck and head are not upright" (5&#x2013;6). He concludes that "physical inferiority is rarely the basis of warrior bravery" . Indeed, such stereotypes inflamed anti-Semitism and caused another backlash against Jewish civil rights. </p>

<p>More than a century after the debate over Jewish fitness for military service began in earnest, the negation of the stereotype of the un-soldierly Jew now became a central part of the Zionist platform. It is no coincidence that the names of Jewish war heroes from antiquity&#x2014;particularly, Bar Kochba and the Maccabees&#x2014;would be resurrected as the models for regenerating the Jewish body and cultivating a martial manliness characterized by the soldierly values of bravery, courage, and aggression. And what is remarkable is that the very stereotypes promulgated by the anti-Semites would be internalized, oftentimes, as Sander Gilman has shown, through the mechanisms of Jewish self-hatred.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Here, Walter Rathenau, the assimilated German-Jewish industrialist who would become the foreign minister of Germany in 1922, provided one of the paradigmatic accounts of this transformation, citing his own "metamorphosis" from a "tribal" Jew into a "German" Jew. In 1897, the year before Nordau's call for a "muscular Judaism," Rathenau published a short essay in the influential Berlin journal, <i>Zukunft</i>, called "H&#x00F6;re, Israel!" (Hear, O Israel!), in which he appealed to Jews to "look at [themselves] in the mirror" and take the necessary steps to reform their bodies.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  With regard to Jews living in a society imbued with Prussian military values, he writes: "You should be all the more careful not to walk about in an unkempt and lethargic manner, and thereby become the laughingstock of a disciplined race brought up in a strict military fashion. As soon as you have recognized your puny build, your hunched shoulders, your clumsy feet, your flaccid roundish shape, you will resolve to dedicate a few generations to the regeneration of your outer appearance" . In Rathenau's assessment, Jews&#x2014;as a race&#x2014;lacked the martial discipline and physical constitution of their German counterparts. Although Rathenau later withdrew this essay from circulation when it became clear that it abetted anti-Semitism, the critiques that he raised were vociferously debated in the years that led up to World War I and widely accepted as a justification of the Jewish politics of corporeal regeneration.  </p>

<p>Across the political spectrum, Jews began to call upon fellow Jews to undertake a rigorous physical program of corporeal reform and to resurrect the martial traditions of their ancestors, which they had variously given up or lost in the diaspora.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  In 1907, for example, Elias Auerbach published a short but programmatic piece "On the Military Fitness of the Jews" in <i>Die J&#x00FC;dische Turnzeitung </i>(Jewish Gymnastics Journal), in which he argued that Jews are not inherently less capable of serving in the military than other people; rather, they are called up in smaller numbers because the quantitative indicators of their fitness&#x2014;particularly, chest size measurements&#x2014;are, on average, lower. He explains: "Chest circumference essentially depends upon two things: the size of the lungs and the strength of the chest muscles. Both are closely related to the intensity of breathing. This is obvious with regard to lung size, but it is also the case 

<b></b>

 with the strength of the chest muscles, which are primarily breathing muscles and gradually strengthen with deep breathing, as will other muscles with regular training" (JTZ: 1907, no. 10/11, 189). People who work in the country (as opposed to the city) and who engage in manual labor will have larger chest muscles and, hence, appear to be more fit for military service. Among the Jews, he argues, there are very few farmers but lots of "accountants, traders, tailors, and academics" (JTZ: 1907, no. 10/11, 189). Hence, there are lots of Jews with small chests. The solution, which can hardly be surprising for the journal's readership, is physical training, exercise, and sports, with a specific attention to gymnastics exercises aimed at developing the chest muscles. The result, Auerbach predicts, would be more Jews selected for military service and more Jews distinguishing themselves in the military. </p>

<p>The following year, Heinrich Loewe, an avid supporter of Jewish ethnic pride and nationalist feeling, published an essay in <i>Die J&#x00FC;dische Turnzeitung</i> called "Die Makkab&#x00E4;er" (The Maccabees). Loewe had been instrumental in organizing the first Jewish-nationalist student associations, particularly the <i>Vereinigung J&#x00FC;discher Studenten</i> (Association of Jewish Students) as a counterweight to the anti-Semitic <i>Verein Deutscher Studenten</i>.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  For Loewe, as with many of his Zionist colleagues, the Maccabees represented the quintessential paradigm of Jewish nationalist strength and bravery, a "heroic race" [<i>Heldengeschlecht</i>] that must be emulated today (JTZ: 1908, no. 12, 213). According to Loewe, the Maccabees demonstrated that "heroes [could be] created from a cowardly tribe," proving that "even an inconsequential tribe is in the position, through national self-help, to defy a militarized world" (JTZ: 1908, no. 12, 217). Loewe concludes his celebration of the Maccabees by citing what he imagines to have been their high level of physical fitness: "The first resistance of the heroic Maccabee race was probably due to gymnastics. &#x2026; Their heroic deeds thoroughly proved that their bodies were trained in all the gymnastic arts and steeled for genuine battles" (JTZ: 1908, no. 12, 218). Not coincidentally, this was the same rhetoric that the <i>Vereinigung J&#x00FC;discher Studenten</i> had used for nearly a decade to call upon its members to reform their bodies: "By steeling our physical strength and increasing our dexterity, our bodies will be masculine and full of energy, ready to execute the orders of the mind."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Shortly after the start of World War I, the <i>J&#x00FC;dische Rundschau</i>, under the editorial direction of Loewe, reprinted a rousing speech by Franz Oppenheimer entitled "Alte und neue Makkab&#x00E4;er" (Old and New Maccabees).<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The editor included a short prefatory note explaining the decision to reprint the speech nearly a decade after it was delivered by referencing the timeliness of the historical moment in which "the ideals of the t for freedom in Russia, in which the blood of Jewish heroes has been spilt, can be realized" . Not only did the vast majority of Jews entertain the hope that the First World War would bring about better conditions and even liberate the masses of Eastern European Jews living in ghettos and miserable poverty, but they also believed that the War would be a proving ground for the emergence of an "old-new" Jewish race, one which was imbued by the heroic bravery and strength of the Maccabees. In his speech, Oppenheimer cites the spate of violent pogroms across Kishinev, Homel, Odessa, and Kiev, and wonders&#x2014;not unlike the poet Haim Nahman Bialik<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> &#x2014;whether 

<b></b>

 "the Jewish masses have lost their Maccabee anger and Maccabee courage" . Perhaps it has been suppressed, he suggests, but even the poor "pants-selling youth"<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  of the Eastern European ghettos are, he maintained, "true descendants of the Maccabees" . Now, more than a decade later, World War I would be the decisive moment to reawaken this pride and regenerate the heroism of the "old" Maccabees.  </p>

<p>Indeed, just days after the start of World War I, Loewe had already called upon the German Jews to defend their fatherland with the courage and bravery exhibited by the Maccabees.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Like Oppenheimer, he saw no contradiction between this unflagging support of Germany and the ideals of the Maccabees: It was through Germany that "progress, freedom, and culture" would be preserved against the "terrible tyranny, bloody cruelty, and dark regression"  enveloping Europe. ting for Germany was essentially a Maccabean t against a modern-day tyranny that sought to "annihilate 'the land of culture'" and place a stranglehold on Jewish freedom and prosperity . Loewe's call to German Jews, supported by the <i>Reichsverein der Deutschen Juden</i> and the <i>Zionistische Vereinigung f&#x00FC;r Deutschland</i>, reads as follows: "In these hours, it must be shown anew that we&#x2014;as tribally proud Jews&#x2014;belong among the best sons of the fatherland. The nobility of our millennia of history obliges us. We expect that our youth will voluntarily and cheerfully defend the flag. &#x2026; We trust that our youth&#x2014;strengthened by the cultivation of their Jewish consciousness and their physical education [<i>k&#x00F6;rperliche Ausbildung</i>] in ideal conviction and manly courage&#x2014;will distinguish themselves in all war-like virtues" . Emboldened by their heroic ting tradition and physically regenerated in the gymnastics halls of modern-day Europe, Jews would bravely serve the German fatherland and prove, once and for all, that they were a military people. </p>

<p>Significantly, nearly all the Zionists (and Loewe was no exception) did not perceive a contradiction between their loyalty to the nations in which they lived and their ultimate desire for a Jewish homeland in Palestine.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In fact, the <i>J&#x00FC;dische Rundschau</i> carried a permanent citation from the Basel Program across its masthead, which read: "The goal of Zionism is to establish a legally and publicly secure state in Palestine for the Jewish people." In August 1914, printed just a few inches below this citation was Loewe's call to German Jews "to give their entire heart, their entire soul, and their entire means to the service of the fatherland" . As Michael Berkowitz points out, "Zionists in both the Central and Allied powers &#x2026; rationalized that their own country's victory would hasten the conversion of Zionist dreams into reality."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  They did not perceive an issue of conflicted or double loyalties. According to Loewe, ting for the German fatherland not only gave Jews the chance to showcase their loyalty and permanently negate the stereotype of Jewish cowardice, but it also allowed Jews to t for a common goal, side-by-side with their German brothers in arms: "When we t as citizens of our fatherland, the bravery of our ancestors, the courage unto death of the Maccabees, the tremendous t of Bar Kochba, and the heroic death of hundreds of thousands of our people throughout the ages comes shining through as a glorious example. We will be victorious. We have the confidence in the German Emperor that he is leading us right. We have confidence in the German people that they will t to their last 

<b></b>

 breath, and we have the unshakable confidence in the divine justice that will bring victory to our honest brothers in arms." . </p>

<p>Jewish enthusiasm for the War and unequivocal support of Germany persisted across the ideological spectrum in a range of pro-Zionist, non-Zionist, and anti-Zionist publications, something that underscores the fact that muscular Judaism was part of a broader, European-wide project of modern body reform. For example, while the pan-Jewish cultural magazine <i>Ost und West</i> never embraced an explicit pro-Zionist or pro-German nationalist political platform, it came out actively in support of the War. In 1914, Binjamin Segel published an extraordinary lead article in the magazine called "Der Krieg als Lehrmeister" (The War as Master Teacher), in which he argued that the War was essentially caused by the "groundless hatred" of Germany by other countries and that German-Jewry would summon its own ancestral glory to defend its fatherland.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  "Unlike any other historical event," Segel writes, "war answers the question of how much bravery, contempt for death, discipline, organizational capacity, sacrificial courage, and physical strength lies within a people" . Far from being "cowardly" or "un-warlike," Jews have a long "warrior" tradition, including, among others, the warriors of Jephtha, Gideon, Saul, Job, Jehuda, and, of course, the Maccabees . Both ancestral Jews and present-day Jews embody the values of "cold-bloodedness, determination, resourcefulness, heightened vigilance, and unconditional trustworthiness" , thereby negating the "fable of the Jew who is militarily inferior" . The War, Segel believed, would not only teach present-day Jews to be warriors but also teach the rest of the world to accept the regenerated muscle Jews as a legitimate warrior people.  </p>

<p>On the other side of the Jewish ideological spectrum, the anti-Zionist <i>Kartell-Convent vereingten Korporationen</i>, formerly the <i>Kartell Convent deutscher Studenten j&#x00FC;discher Glaubens</i> (Association of German Students of Jewish Faith) came out strongly in support of the War, publishing an array of articles on the success of the war effort and lists of its fallen brothers who "died a heroic death for the fatherland."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The Kartell-Convent, or K.C. for short, was originally formed in 1896 when three Jewish fraternities established an interuniversity association to advocate for full academic equality for Jewish students and t anti-Semitism.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The students of the K.C. proclaimed that they were German students of Jewish faith and supported activities, such as gymnastics, fencing, and dueling, which would showcase their physical fitness, honor, and ethnic-national pride.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Its main publication, the <i>K.C.-Bl&#x00E4;tter</i>, carried the following mission statement: "The bonds of the K.C. are tied to the ground and convictions of the German fatherland. Its goal is to t anti-Semitism in the German student body and to educate its members to become self-aware Jews who are conscious of the fact that the German Jews form an indissolubly connected part of the German fatherland through history, culture, and law, and are always prepared to stand up for the political and social equality of the Jews."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Beginning with its first issue in October 1910, the <i>K.C.-Bl&#x00E4;tter</i> also featured an extraordinary illustration on its cover depicting three naked youths engaged in battle [<a href="#3">re 3</a>]. The illustration was printed on the cover for its first year and then it was 

<b></b>

 removed; it returned in the March&#x2013;April 1915 issue and was carried on the cover of each subsequent "war edition." In it, we see three highly stylized, muscular Jews lunging toward light with swords in their hands, as if engaged in a t for their honor, with an enemy that is not or cannot be depicted. While the image may represent three Jews dueling for their honor against anti-Semitism in 1910, its reproduction in 1915 is certainly meant to illustrate Jewish military bravery in the t for the German fatherland. Since the faces are partially or fully obscured, we are drawn directly to the musculature of their bodies: their strong arms, the build of their chest and breast, and the sinews of their buttocks and legs. Each re is shown from a slightly different angle revealing the side, the phallus, and the buttocks. Indeed, the left-most re appears to have an erection as he lunges forward with all his virility into the depths of battle.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  This, it seems, is how many German-Jewish men greeted World War I: As a proving ground for their muscularity, militancy, and masculinity.  </p>

<p>Many reasons have been given to explain the prevalent and widespread enthusiasm with which Jews&#x2014;both Zionist and non-Zionist, German and non-German&#x2014;welcomed the coming of the War.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Foremost among the reasons was the belief harbored that the War would finally bring about full acceptance and equality. According to Ludwig Geiger in 1914, Jews "felt themselves to belong to their respective countries" and would "t and suffer for their fatherland." In return, they expected to be treated "justly."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  As Istv&#x00E1;n De&#x00E1;n further explains: "World War I marked the apogee of Jewish participation in the life of Central Europeans. In the delirious enthusiasm of August 1914, Jews were among the greatest enthusiasts. They endorsed the war, in part because the enemy was the anti-Semitic Russian empire, in part because the outcome of the conflict promised to bring their final and complete acceptance."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  While this explanation is certainly true, I would hasten to add that the War represented something else as well: It was the ultimate proving ground for the regenerated muscle Jew. In essence, the War was a chance for male European Jews to definitively prove that they were the modern descendants of their ancestral heroes and thus, particularly for the Zionists, capable of founding and defending a nation-state. The Jewish soldiers in World War I were the modern-day incarnations of the Maccabees or Bar Kochba, and it would be in the trenches and, as we will see below, in the air where they would demonstrate their muscular virility.  </p>

<p>Even after 1916, the year the German War Ministry undertook its notoriously humiliating "Judenz&#x00E4;hlung" (Jew Count) to collect statistical information about the number of Jews serving in the German army, a census that spurred massive anti-Semitic attacks accusing Jews of shirking service and engaging in war profiteering,<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  the War remained a proving ground for Jewish soldiers. Jewish statisticians such as Felix Theilhaber and Jacob Segall quickly published "Jew counts" of their own in order to rebuke the anti-Semites who accused Jews of shirking their duties, or worse, stabbing the German nation in the back.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Jewish war statistics were widely circulated: 100,000 Jews served Germany in the War, the vast majority on the frontlines; 12,000 Jews died ting; 35,000 Jews were decorated in the War; and 2,000 Jews became officers.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Although the War Ministry never officially published its census findings, excerpts were 

<b></b>

 widely used and manipulated by anti-Semitic ideologues, ushering in a tidal wave of propaganda that scapegoated Jews for Germany's defeat. Otto Armin's <i>Juden im Heere </i>(Jews in the Army), a statistical argument purporting to demonstrate Jewish responsibility for Germany's defeat, was published in 1919 and quickly circulated among right-wing, nationalist organizations.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Armin attempted to demonstrate that Jews fought in significantly lower percentages on the front, volunteered to serve in markedly smaller numbers than their non-Jewish counterparts, and, most damningly, could not distinguish themselves as war heroes because of their inhering "H&#x00E4;ndlergeist" . Jews, he argued, had a sneaky, business-like mindset, which predisposed them toward egoistic secrecy, money, espionage, and questionable morality; Germans, on the other hand, had a "Heldengeist," which predisposed them toward national heroism, courage, and self-sacrifice: In the War, Armin concludes, "the 'heroic spirit' of the Germans was driven into the ground by the 'business spirit' of the Jews" .  </p>

<p>In light of the virulence of post-War anti-Semitism, it is all the more understandable that Jewish war veterans (both Zionist and non-Zionists) would see the War as the defining crucible for forging a heroic, nationally and ethnically proud, military masculinity. To this end, the <i>Reichsbund j&#x00FC;discher Frontsoldaten</i> (National Association of Jewish Combat Veterans), or RjF for short, was established in 1919 and sought to 

<b></b>

 rebuke the anti-Semitic lies by educating the public about the Jewish contributions to the war effort and cultivating a heroic, militaristic sensibility among Jewish youth. At its peak, the RjF had between 30,000 and 40,000 members (membership was restricted to Jewish war veterans in Germany), the majority of whom came from middle-class and working-class backgrounds.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  It had an expressly anti-Zionist platform and, like the German-Jewish student associations, sought to cultivate both a Jewish ethnic and German national pride. Leo L&#x00F6;wenstein, who authored the RjF's first call for members in January 1919, argued that Jewish war veterans cannot allow detractors to characterize them as "cowardly shirkers" [<i>Feige Dr&#x00FC;ckeberger</i>]: "We are too proud to stand by idly while our honor as Germans and Jews is besmirched."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Disassociated from political parties, the RjF fought for the recognition of Jewish war veterans and supported the regeneration of the German nation. It was to be composed of "every German Jew who put his life on the line to t for the fatherland" and sought to work "to help it blossom with new strength" . The RjF existed up until 1938.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Beginning in 1920, the RjF began publishing <i>Der Schild</i> (The Shield), a weekly news journal directed primarily at Jewish war veterans and Jewish youth. It specifically sought to combat anti-Semitic propaganda and change public perceptions about Jewish war service. At the same time, the journal carried an extensive array of articles on the regeneration of the Jewish body, focusing primarily on the nexus between sports and military heroism. Not limited just to gymnastics and fencing, the RjF supported a wide-range of contact combat "body exercises" including boxing, Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, and judo, all of which were considered to "strengthen and steel the entire musculature."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Cognizant of the specifications of the body for military service, the RjF wanted its members and youth to "fully develop their respiratory system, increase their chest circumference through exercise, and open up the capacities of their lungs all the more." It also wanted the heart "strengthened and the blood pressure increased." Importantly, the RjF believed that sports would not only result in a body fit for serving in the military but also cultivate specific military qualities such as "striking power, determination, mental presence, complete mastery of the body, adroitness, agility, courage, bravery, coldbloodedness, tenacity, endurance, the cultivation of reason and abstinence." As the author succinctly concludes: "Sport is battle!"<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  </p>

<p>To be sure, the link between sports and militarization was hardly new and, at least in Germany, extends back to Prussian military training and the growth of the <i>Turnen</i> movement throughout the nineteenth century.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Even in Jewish periodicals, such as <i>Die J&#x00FC;dische Turnzeitung</i>, the connection between military training and gymnastics was evident years before the First World War, with numerous articles articulating the relationship between sport and military fitness.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  In fact, as early as 1907, Hebrew was introduced to Jewish gymnastics practices as a "commando" language (very much in contrast to Yiddish) in order to elicit ancient heroic traditions.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  As Gideon Reuveni has pointed out, the drill commands of the Israeli army can probably be traced back to the Hebraicization of certain German phrases used in gymnastics practice<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> : "Eyes looking forward!", "Head high!", "Shoulders back!", and "Chest out!" were commands used by "the Hebrew gymnastics commando" to refer to both gymnastics exercises and 

<b></b>

 military drills.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  It should come as no surprise, then, that the RjF firmly believed&#x2014;not unlike German nationalist thinkers, such as Ernst J&#x00FC;nger&#x2014;that "the most important condition of life remains the completely steeled body!" [<i>der allseitig gest&#x00E4;hlte K&#x00F6;rper</i>].<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Through sport and military activities, muscle would be transformed into steel.  </p>

<p>It was precisely this rhetoric of "steeling" and "hardening" the Jewish body that emerged as the single most important leitmotif in <i>Der Schild</i>. In 1922, <i>Der Schild</i> called upon Jewish women to educate their children "in equal measure with respect to mental and physical strength." Mothers and sisters would "t along with" the male members of the RjF by preserving "the sublime source of our Judaism through the steeling of the body."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Not only, then, would the members of the RjF act as "the living statistics of Jewish soldiers on the front," but the organization would also support the development of a militaristic level of "physical fitness" in all the German-Jewish youth, thereby permanently "steeling body and mind."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  But after World War I, it was not gymnasts, boxers, wrestlers, or even front soldiers who represented the epitome of the steeled body; it was aviators&#x2014;for the flier literally melded together man and machine in the destructive world of the technological sublime. </p>

<p>On the one hand, then, the project of "steeling" the Jewish body&#x2014;of turning muscle Jews into military Jews, of transforming flesh into steel&#x2014;was a response to the virulently anti-Semitic propaganda accusing German Jews of shirking their military duties and undermining the German nation. It was an attempt to prove that Jews were both militaristic and patriotic, regardless of their position with respect to Zionism. Moreover, it was an attempt to negate the stereotype of the Jew as bourgeois merchant or speculator, who deals in abstractions and leeches off the German people. On the other hand, the "steeling" of the Jewish body has to be seen as part of a broader, decidedly modern social and cultural project of connecting the Jewish male body with both its heroic ancestral tradition and its future-oriented national redemption. In this regard, the steeled muscle Jew stands at the center of a tradition facing both ways at once.  </p>

<p>For proto-fascist thinkers such as Ernst J&#x00FC;nger who put forward a new, heroic masculinity derived explicitly from the front experience, "war is a process that regenerates both the nation and the soldier male himself."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  J&#x00FC;nger, as Klaus Theweleit explains, rejected the same stereotypes&#x2014;the merchant, the man of abstractions and speculations, the safety and security of the intellectual, the complacency and weakness of the bourgeoisie&#x2014;in favor of an image of a new race of warriors who embraced an ethos of military masculinity, discipline, strength, and heroism. But what is significant is that Jews embraced these ideals as well and modeled their bodies after them. To be sure, we all know that the image of the German Jew that ultimately won out in the final years of the Weimar Republic was not the one that was muscular, nationalistic, and militarized; rather it was the one that was an exploiter, a degenerate, parasitic contagion who undermined and emasculated the German nation.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  But there is another side of the story prior to 1933. In fact, in the first third of the twentieth century, German Jews also sought to combat degeneracy, weakness, and emasculation by embracing the very same ethos of military masculinity, discipline, strength, and heroism. 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>At the same time that the specter of the effeminate, homosexual, and degenerate Jew haunted the integrity of the fascist male body and thereby helped to negatively define its contours,<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  we must also consider the very real ways in which Jews sought to regenerate their own bodies and engineer their own forms of armoring, social administration, and muscular militancy. The Great War was both the proving ground and the crucible for the creation of a militarized race of "old-new Maccabees"&#x2014;Jews, who in their steeled bodies and warrior image, exhibited the same "heroic spirit" of their German counterparts. Jewish bodies, then, cannot be considered merely allegories of the weak, formless, and deviant in contrast to the armored heroism of German bodies, even if they were precisely that for the fascist imaginary. We must also inquire into what the Great War meant for Jewish masculinity by examining the representational and rhetorical practice of Jews. As we will see, the steeled muscle Jew is a paradigmatic re of the tensions, ambivalences, and dangers of European modernism. </p>

<p>Emerging out of the War and reaching a heyday during the Weimar Republic, there is no better image of the steeled Jewish body than that of the Jewish flier. As a combat ace, aviator, glider, and even world-record holder, the Jewish flier melded the muscled body with the technologically steeled body. Felix Theilhaber endowed the Jewish flier with its most enduring cultural expression in his 1924 book, <i>J&#x00FC;dische Flieger im Weltkrieg</i> (Jewish Fliers in World War).<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  In the years that followed, countless paeans to Jewish fliers, many of which followed upon and referenced Theilhaber's book, would be featured on the pages of <i>Der Schild</i>, including the story of Charles Levine, a New York Jew who broke Charles Lindbergh's distance record in 1928. But before turning to Theilhaber's book and the Jewish flier, we must first briefly contextualize the mythology of flying in the modernist imaginary. After a discussion of the machine-body complex in the years surrounding the Great War, I will, then, turn to Jewish aviation fantasies and Jewish fliers. The steeled muscle Jew, I conclude, is the embodiment of the dialectic of modernity, its corporeal hopes and catastrophes. </p>

II. Bodies, Machines, War: Jewish Aviators and the Modernist Imaginary
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Shortly after the end of World War I, Max Ernst, the co-founder of Cologne Dadaism, produced an untitled collage, which is known today simply as <i>Airplane</i> . The central image of the collage consists of portions of a biplane fused with strangely elongated human arms. Ernst foregrounded the machine-body amalgam in the center of an undifferentiated sky, and on the ground, in the lower right-hand corner, he placed two men clad in military uniforms evacuating a third who appears to be injured. Viewers who encountered this image in 1920 probably intuited the relationship between the three men in the corner and the anthropomorphic machine in the sky: Airplanes both extended and destroyed the integrity of the human body. In effect, men could merge with flying machines, and flying machines could annihilate the body. After all, World War I was the first "material battle" (<i>Materialschlacht</i>) in which aviation technologies were widely used in reconnaissance missions, man-to-man combat, and, by the end of the War, bombing raids. In Ernst's collage, the human arms and bourgeois tie appear 

<b></b>

 to naturally grow out of the airplane's nose, while the plane's front fuselage and tail have replaced a human head and legs. It is as if the body and the machine have become fused into a new machine-man via the double-logic of the prosthesis: The machine adds to (while destroying) and subtracts from (while creating) the body.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  In the corner of Ernst's collage, the tiny, fragile body is carried away, while the machinic technology, melding with and also destroying the human body, looms larger than life from above.  </p>

<p>When Ernst composed a short biographical sketch of the key dates in his life several years later, he indicated the significance of the War as both a destroyer and a creator, an assessment he shared with many of his dada colleagues: "Max Ernst died on the 1<sup>st</sup> of August 1914. He resuscitated on the 11<sup>th</sup> of November, 1918 as a young man aspiring to become a magician and to find the myth of his time."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  The myth of his time is embodied, I would suggest, by the technologies of flight, and for the modernist imaginary, nowhere were its dialectical possibilities more fully expressed than in the First World War. As a modern mythology, flying not only elevated human beings into the air and unbound them from the seemingly mundane fetters of the earth, but it also transformed the very nature of time and space by reconring the phenomenology of distance, speed, and duration.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  And, at the same time, the technologies of flight unleashed massive, new means of destruction, ones that would become ever more radicalized as time and space were mastered. One need only call to mind the unending panegyrics to the Wright brothers in the first decade of the twentieth century, the feat of Louis Bl&#x00E9;riot flying across the English Channel in 1909, the wild embrace of flying by the Futurists to liberate human beings from the facticities of time and space, or the celebrated image of the combat ace in the popular imagination. As the Russian Futurist writer, Vasily Vasilyevich Kamensky, recalled with respect to the period around 1910: "The airplane&#x2014;that is the truest achievement of our time. The aviator is the man of worthy heights. If we are really Futurists &#x2026; if we are people of the motorized present, poets of universal dynamism, newcomers and messengers of the future, masters of action and activity, enthusiastic builders of new forms of life&#x2014;then we must be, we have no choice but to be, fliers."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  Kamensky was heralding the emergence of a new race: A race of fliers.  </p>

<p>Prior to the Great War, it was the Italian Futurist, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who most fervently celebrated the new body-machine amalgam of the flier in all its dialectical expressions of destruction and rebirth.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  As the great apostle of speed and technology, he famously glorified war as "the world's only hygiene" and hailed the emergence of a new race of "gay incendiaries with charred fingers."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Inspired by his experience in an aircraft during the international air show at Brescia in 1909, a "momentous event" that launched "the aviation craze in Italy &#x2026; and introduced the muses into an Italian aerodrome for the first time,"<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  Marinetti considered flying, as he wrote in the "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature" (May 1912), "to break apart the old shackles of logic and the plumb lines of the ancient way of thinking."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  The manifesto, composed shortly after returning from the Battle of Tripoli, a colonial war in which he participated "in all the most violent, most virile, and most heroic actions,"<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  consists of an airplane 

<b></b>

 propeller dictating laws for "[destroying] syntax" and creating a new form of subjectivity . Marinetti ends by claiming that "we will conquer the seemingly unconquerable hostility that separates out human flesh from the metal of motors" . In effect, the airplane will inaugurate a new mode of being-in-the-world, one which brings man together with machine, flesh together with motor.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  Not without irony, it was the young Franz Kafka who made a similar observation about Bl&#x00E9;riot's body, when he witnessed the famous aviator take off in the 1909 Brescia air show: "One sees his straight upper body over the wings, his legs are stretched down like part of the machinery."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Man and machine have become one. </p>

<p>It was this permanent melding together of man and machine that Ernst J&#x00FC;nger would later celebrate in his autobiographical chronicles of the Great War as well as in his essayistic reflections on the utopian possibilities of total warfare. In his book, <i>Das W&#x00E4;ldchen 125</i>, a diary of six weeks of trench warfare during July&#x2013;August 1918 in an area known as Rossignol Wood or Copse 125 of the Western Front, J&#x00FC;nger proclaimed that the War brought forth a new kind of human being, one in which man and machine had become fused together in an amalgam of bloody flesh and dangerous explosivity: "I see in old Europe a new and commanding breed rising up, fearless and fabulous, unsparing of blood and sparing of pity, inured to suffering the worst and to inflicting it and ready to stake all to attain their ends&#x2014;a race that builds machines and trusts machines, to whom machines are not soulless iron, but engines of might which it controls with cold reason and hot blood."<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  And like Marinetti, it was the airmen, the combat aces who embraced "the ardor of speed" and become "dismembered by the rush of air if they are shot down by the enemy" (<i>Copse 125</i>, 88, 89), who represented "a new manifestation of mankind" (<i>Copse 125</i>, 87).  </p>

<p>J&#x00FC;nger not only imagined war in the same hygienic terms as Marinetti, but he went even further: He conceived of a world in which the horror of technological warfare was its permanent fixture. As Walter Benjamin perceptively characterized his vision: The desire for an "endless war ... is nothing other than an uninhibited translation of the principles of <i>l'art pour l'art</i> to war itself."<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  That is to say, J&#x00FC;nger glorified war not for some other end, such as why and how war is waged, but only for the sake of war itself. Unlike other contemporary cultural commentators and critics, J&#x00FC;nger had no interest in working through or coming to terms with the trauma of war<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup> ; instead, the Great War was an absolute end in itself, a creative, downright regenerative force that brought a new race of men into the world. </p>

<p>Of course, the vast majority of soldiers who survived the War did not come back as the embodiments of Marinetti's man-machine aesthetic or J&#x00FC;nger's new race of technologically steeled soldier-workers.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  Instead, they came back shell-shocked, with massively disring injuries to their faces, arms, and legs, all of which undermined the integrity of their manhood and their ability to regenerate the German nation.<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  As Paul Lerner has shown in his illuminating study of war trauma, it was the re of the male hysteric&#x2014;"Hysteria virilis"&#x2014;who haunted the German imagination and symbolized the nation's various shortcomings and failures during the First World War and its immediate aftermath. Because the male hysteric was unable to work or serve 

<b></b>

 in the military and, according to the argument of German psychiatrists, shirked his patriotic duties, he threatened Germany's economic power, political stability, and military strength. Male hysteria, according to Lerner, had less to do with an explicit feminization and more to do with "medically manufacturing proper German subjects" able to rise up and defend the nation due to their health, capacity for work, military service, patriotism, and ability to engage in biological reproduction.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  </p>

<p>It was Ernst Toller, a German Jew who fought in World War I, who composed the most damning indictment of how the war emasculated "German" men. His play, <i>Der deutscheHinkemann</i> (written in 1921/22), thematized the trauma of war on the body of the German soldier. It was performed throughout Germany and across Europe in the following years. The main character, Hinkemann, returns home from the war to his devoted wife as a cripple, "as something monstrous," nothing but a "living corpse."<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  During the war, we find out, Hinkemann suffered an injury that left him without male genitalia, and he is now designated a "eunuch." Although he tries to claim his injury as his own&#x2014;"Here stands a real-live eunuch!" &#x2014;and wonders how those who publicly ridicule him will be man enough to build a new society, his mortification eventually drives his wife to commit suicide at the end of the play. Before the final desperate scenes, Hinkemann searchingly poses a critical question which links his masculinity with social productivity: "When someone ... who was in the war ... for example ... had one's sex ... one's sex shot off ... what ... what would happen to him in the new society?" . In German, the term "<i>Geschlecht</i>" (sex) can refer to biological sex and gender as well as race or lineage. Hinkemann wonders whether someone without a "<i>Geschlecht</i>" can participate in&#x2014;that is to say, reproduce&#x2014;a society (<i>Gesellschaft</i>) in which men are supposed to be healthy, productive, and self-sufficient.  </p>

<p>J&#x00FC;nger's response was simply to come up with a new creation myth, one which obviated biological reproduction. In <i>Der Kampf als inneres Erlebnis</i> (<i>The Battle as Inner Experience</i>) , J&#x00FC;nger detailed the birth of a new race of "super men." It was none other than Nietzsche's "<i>&#x00DC;bermensch</i>" brought to the frontlines and left there forever.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  In a paradigmatic statement of the war's uniquely generative sexuality, J&#x00FC;nger explains: "The war, father of all things, is also our father. He hammered us, chiseled us, and hardened us into what we are. ... The war is not only our father but also our son. We gave birth to him and he to us" (11&#x2013;12).<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  J&#x00FC;nger's martial parthenogenesis is striking not only for its capacity to be an exclusively male domain but also for its total obviation of reproduction itself. If the war is our forefather and also our offspring, then the war not only gave birth to the men in the trenches, but they also, closing the circle, gave birth to it. J&#x00FC;nger considers the war to be the showcase of virility, charged to the limit with an "overflowing manliness" [<i>&#x00FC;berstr&#x00F6;mende M&#x00E4;nnlichkeit</i>] .<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  In his unambiguous words: "The style of the material battle and trench warfare &#x2026; gave birth to men that the world has never seen before. It was an entirely new race embodied by energy and loaded with the highest force. Supple, lithe, sinewy bodies, prominent faces, and eyes hardened under the helmets by a thousand horrors. &#x2026; The battle is not only destruction but also the manly form of creation [<i>die m&#x00E4;nnliche Form der Zeugung</i>]" (37, 50). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>In 1933, J&#x00FC;nger published a photo anthology, <i>Flying is Necessary,</i> in which he hoped for the coming of "a complete race [<i>Geschlecht</i>] of fliers."<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  He glorified the form of the well-oiled, metallic motor as the "embodiment of a new martialism" (LN, 9), and in his magnum opus, <i>Der Arbeiter:Herrschaft und Gestalt </i>(The Worker: Dominance and Form), even declared that "the motor ... [is] the symbol of our time."<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  Not surprisingly, the photograph anthology is filled with hundreds of pictures of airplanes, combat fliers, and shiny motors. He intimates a crucial connection between technology, war, and the virile body of the flier when he writes that "the person who flies is perhaps the most vivid manifestation of a new manliness. He represents a type who was already indicated during the war" (LN, 8&#x2013;9). As the underbelly to Ernst's murderous airplane, in which both man and technology are destroyed by one another, there is a strikingly unambiguous anthropomorphism in the staging of many of the photographs of motors in <i>Flying is Necessary</i> [<a href="#4">re 4</a>]. J&#x00FC;nger himself had posed what he termed "the decisive question of nature" regarding the breakdown of the difference between machines and human beings: "Who flies then, the machine or me?" (LN, 9). The answer, it seems, judging by the photographs of airplane motors with outstretched, cylindrical 'arms,' bolted 'faces' which spurn individuality, and mechanical 'torsos' composed of only the most efficient circuitry for routing blood, appears to be the sublation of the binary man/machine into the form of the "soldier-worker," heralding a new race of combat fliers. </p>

<p>While the "steeling" of the Jewish male body was never expressed in terms that equal the extremity of J&#x00FC;nger's technological fantasy, it is also worth noting that the Jewish male body was never represented (at least not in the Jewish press) as enfeebled, hysterical, or emasculated. There was no Jewish "Hinkemann," and certainly in the representations created by the RjF, there was no Jewish "hysteria virilis." The Great War, we are to believe, had quite the opposite effect on Jewish men. Even if a Jewish man was crippled by injuries sustained during the War, he still took to the air because he was part of a new race of fliers. As Felix Theilhaber indicates in his telling of the heroic story of Jacob Ledermann, a Jewish combat ace who was shot in the stomach, crashed in enemy camps, and suffered seemingly debilitating injuries (JF, 37&#x2013;39), Ledermann returned to fly again by the end of the War, entering German gliding competitions at the Rh&#x00F6;n.<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In his cultural history of Jewish aviators in the War, Theilhaber reproduces two pictures of the Jewish war hero [<a href="#5">res 5</a>&#x2013;<a href="#6">6</a>]: The first shows a boyish-looking Ledermann, outfitted in his flying gear and gazing into the space of the unknown with a decisive clarity of vision. The photograph captures his muscular torso, his strong arms and broad chest, but only intimates the presence of the flying machine. Prepared for aerial combat, Ledermann is the embodiment of the steeled muscle Jew. The second photograph, taken at a gliding contest in the Rh&#x00F6;n in 1924, shows Ledermann's plane shortly after its release. In this picture, the machine dominates, and Ledermann's head can barely be made out in the cockpit. As a kind of sublation of the man-machine binary, the greatness of the new amalgam eclipses the mere mortals scattered on the ground, for Ledermann and his glider embodied a new kind of heroic masculinity, one that absorbed and perhaps even negated the injuries he suffered in the War. As proof of 

<b></b>

 his heroism, Theilhaber cites a report from a German newspaper, which mythologizes his return to flight: "Ledermann, who was severely injured in the War, sat in a glider for the first time. Like a bird of prey with outstretched wings that defied gravity, his machine climbed a path into the blue ether" (JF, 38). He went on to win four prizes in the German gliding competition at the Wasserkuppe. </p>

<p>As Peter Fritzsche has indicated in his cultural history of German aviation, the combat ace was widely celebrated and deeply respected in the popular imagination during and after the War because he represented a new ideal of individual courage 

<b></b>

 in the face of the monstrous mass death on the ground. In Fritzsche's words: "In control of his fate, handling his airplane with great courage and skill but also with an envied recklessness, the aviator appeared to be a genuine war hero, comparable to cavalrymen in Napoleon's era or chivalrous knights in the Middle Ages. Beginning in 1915, aces found themselves lionized as hugely popular celebrities, particularly in France and Germany. And after the War, a steady stream of hagiography enhanced their heroic status."<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  The combat ace&#x2014;outfitted in a leather cap, flying goggles, and a scarf&#x2014;became an instantly recognizable symbol of the heroic qualities of the nation, linking individual courage with military-technical precision. It is not by accident that Theilhaber reproduces pictures of Jewish aces that are meant to remind the German public of its favorite aces, Oswald Boelcke and Baron von Richthofen. Poised with an unflappable confidence in their deeds, in their machine, and most of all in themselves, these men embodied a new heroism.  </p>

<p>While J&#x00FC;nger saw the worker-soldier or combat ace as a fundamental break with the past, Theilhaber and members of the RjF believed that the Jewish men who had come forth in battle were finally reunited&#x2014;in a decidedly modern incarnation&#x2014;with their ancestral heroes. They were hardened, chiseled, and steeled in the trenches and in the air. This is because the modern-day flier, like the ancient warrior family of the Maccabees, "is unquestionably of a soldierly, heroic nature."<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  As one report from the RjF's "gliding group" asserted with respect to flying: We will "toughen [<i>st&#x00E4;hlen</i>] our hearts and lungs, practice with our eyes and hands, raise our Jewish youth in the spirit of the Spartans, teach them courage, self-mastery, coldbloodedness, bravery, mental presence in the spirit of our heroic forefathers, [so that they] t strongly and prove victorious!"<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  As Leo L&#x00F6;wenstein later wrote with regard to the importance of "gliding" for the German-Jewish youth: "From the beginning, the noble task of the RjF 

<b></b>

 has been to assure the physical and moral fitness of the coming generations," and it is through flying that "new sources of muscular and mental strength will be opened up for our youth."<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>  Jews will be tough because they fly, and they will fly because they are tough. </p>

<p>When Theilhaber published the first edition of his book, <i>J&#x00FC;dische Flieger</i> in 1919, picture books and magazines glorifying flying were already legion in Germany. Nearly all celebrated the transcendental possibilities of flight and coupled it with an evocation of nationalist feeling and achievement.<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>  The title of one of the best known German aviation books published in 1915 leaves little question about the ideological and technological motivations: <i>Deutschlands Eroberung der Luft</i> (Germany's Conquest of the Air).<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>  The book contained more than three hundred glossy photographs documenting the history of flight in Germany up through the first year of the War, including the technological developments of different kinds of flying machines, aerial reconnaissance pictures, and scores of pilots, especially world record holders. But as Theilhaber rightly pointed out, the feats of Jewish fliers remained considerably less well-known. Due to the rise of anti-Semitism that "named Jews as cowards, shirkers, and saboteurs" (JF, 9), it was all the more important to draw attention to and celebrate this history. </p>

<p>As a committed Zionist, Theilhaber was not interested in propagating nationalist hymns to the German fatherland; instead, he was interested in presenting an accurate picture of Jewish participation in the Great War and showcasing Jewish heroism. For the 1924 edition of <i>J&#x00FC;dische Flieger</i>, Theilhaber solicited the non-Jewish Lieutenant Colonel Siegert, the officer who oversaw the German air force during the War, to write the introduction. Siegert not only points out the broad competencies required for flying (the fact that it brings technical and strategic skills together with the knowledge of physics, aerodynamics, and meteorology) but also underscores the fact that Jewish fliers excelled in all these areas: "The contributions that our Jewish citizens made to the War must be judged more highly and recognized more selflessly than those made during times of peace" (JF, 7). In this regard, the book is both a rejoinder to the anti-Semitic propaganda and a celebration of the "warrior existence [<i>Kriegerdasein</i>] of Jewish soldiers" (JF, 10). </p>

<p>Theilhaber begins the book by elucidating the qualities of "heroism" and "bravery" by attempting to unlock "the solitary world of the flier" (JF, 14). Illustrated by an aerial photograph of the Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain covered in snow and bathed in clouds, Theilhaber immediately evokes the transcendental mythology of flying. Very much in line with the place of aviation in the modernist imaginary, Jewish fliers also partook in "the romance with the machine."<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>  Soaring above the clouds elicits a profound greatness that breaks away from the everyday sense of being limited to the ground. It cannot be achieved by just anyone and certainly "a people of physically inferior elements will not produce a strong contingent of fit fliers" (JF, 15). But as we learn by reading Theilhaber's book, there were hundreds of Jewish fliers who partook in the widest range of activities during the War, ranging from aerial combat to reconnaissance missions. And they came from all walks of life&#x2014;actors, school teachers, factory workers, merchants, traders, and artists&#x2014;something that proves, in Theilhaber's 

<b></b>

 view, that Jews are not an inferior race (JF, 118). Instead, they are, in Nordau's tellingly prescient notion, the embodiment of the "true moderns," those individuals who are best adapted to the demands of modern society through discipline, rationality, and clarity of vision.<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Theilhaber's book is illustrated by numerous airplanes and aviators perched in the cockpit ready to undertake heroic missions over enemy territory [<a href="#7">re 7</a>]. And, interestingly, it also included a single picture of a mangled biplane that crashed in a heavily wooded area [<a href="#8">re 8</a>]. Far from undermining Jewish aerial skills, the photograph evokes the inherent risks of flying, something that accords with J&#x00FC;nger's celebration of danger. In fact, J&#x00FC;nger published an entire photo book, <i>The Dangerous Moment</i>, documenting crashing airplanes, balloons, and automobiles in order to demonstrate how the bourgeois world of security had been displaced by a new world of technology, mobilization, and warfare. As he wrote in the introduction, "the increased intrusion of danger into daily life" is a sign that the "bourgeois epoch" of the past is receding and a new world, characterized by danger, uncertainty, and militancy, is unfolding.<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>  Theilhaber considers the Jewish flier to be a part of this new world of danger. </p>

<p>He indicates in no uncertain terms what this meant for the Jewish bourgeoisie, who, in their traditional role, remained safely ensconced behind their desks "in the offices of the metropolis" (JF, 26): Warfare placed new physical, intellectual, and emotional demands on Jewish men, which required them to show courage and fortitude in the face of hunger, cold, and extreme violence. "It is no wonder," Theilhaber writes, "that the lethargic and weak Jewish merchant fell by the wayside all the more quickly" (JF, 27). Here, he not only accepts the prevalence of the Jewish stereotype&#x2014;the very same one that J&#x00FC;nger would rail against&#x2014;but also indicated how it was radically dispelled and displaced by the militarization of the Jewish body in war. Unlike the work of the bourgeoisie, "service in the air force requires iron energy and a daily willingness to sacrifice one's life" (JF, 32). The fact that Jews became exemplary pilots and combat aces, many of whom were decorated for their valor, indicates the extent to which they left behind the old stereotypes and embraced the new ideals of danger, militarism, and wartime heroism. Unlike J&#x00FC;nger, however, Theilhaber writes that Jews did not consider the War to be "sublime" (JF, 68); rather it was a duty in which they served loyally and heroically. The fact that they were honored for their service was not only "proof of their fitness" (JF, 32) but also proof of the fact that "Maccabean courage beat in Jewish hearts" (JF, 88). In effect, the War reconstituted a long lost Jewish militarism, one which, in its modernist incarnation, transformed muscles into steel. </p>

<p>Theilhaber's book was widely received and praised in both the Jewish and non-Jewish press when it was reissued in 1924: In <i>Der Schild</i>, it initiated an entire discourse around Jewish bravery and aviation fantasies, bringing ancestral pride and modernist triumphs to bear on the physical constitution of the new Jewish body. "Our Jewish youth can summon as much courage and mental presence to show the whole public that our new generations are strong enough in terms of body and soul to successfully undertake athletic competitions, including those in the air, that they are capable of putting forth their men as we [the members of the RjF] did in World War.

<p class="continued">
 of the Maccabees has not died out!"<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>  The RjF published scores of articles reviewing and referencing Theilhaber's book and encouraged members to share it with their children. Within the non-Jewish public, Paul Loebe, the President of the Reichstag, even added his own words of praise. </p>

<p>But perhaps the most unexpected reception of Theilhaber's book on Jewish fliers came in the summer of 1927 when the RjF presented a copy to a Jewish businessman from New York City named Charles A. Levine. Together with his pilot, Clarence Chamberlin, Levine had just undertaken an extraordinary transatlantic flight and landed in a wheat field in Germany, about forty miles short of his intended destination, Berlin. Levine embarked on the 4,000 mile journey across the Atlantic Ocean on June 4, 1927, a few weeks after Charles Lindbergh became a world sensation for having completed the first non-stop flight from New York to Paris. Chamberlin and Levine broke Lindbergh's record, flying some four-hundred miles further and eight and half hours longer. The RjF sung their praises: "Lindbergh established an absolute record. Chamberlin and Levine broke it repeatedly. First of all, they flew further. Second, they flew in tandem, thus becoming the first passenger flight over the ocean and demonstrating that air travel is ready to take off. If one is willing, there is also a third record: It consists in the fact that the first Jew flew across the ocean." Although Levine was not the pilot, the RjF argued that it was still an "achievement of courage" and demonstrates the same "manly courage" as that of Jews who served on the front and in the air force.<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In Europe, Levine was greeted by dignitaries from Hindenburg to Mussolini. Back in New York, the Yiddish daily, <i>Der Tog</i>, explained the significance of his flight within the history of the Jewish people, making particular reference to the military spirit of the Jews in War and placing the achievement squarely within the modernist mythology of flight: "This is the record of Jewish bravery, courage, and fortitude &#x2026; We are no longer obliged to prove that Jews are just as capable and strong on the field of physical bravery as they are on the field of intellectual achievement. Every front during the war from 1914&#x2013;1918 could tell the story of Jewish courage and heroism. Every sport bears the names of Jewish players and record-holders. Until recently, however, we have heard little of Jewish pilots giving themselves over to flying. And so it has fallen upon a New York Jew, the son of immigrants from Vilna, to show that the Jew does not stand on the sidelines of the newest, noblest, and most important of human accomplishments."<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>  Levine emerged as a veritable Jewish hero and within days was immortalized in Yiddish songs which proclaimed him to be "the hero of Israel &#x2026; like the patriarchs of old." Two of the songs, one by Irving Grossman and the other by Joseph Feldman, even set their notes to what was then the unofficial Jewish national anthem, "Ha'Tikvah" (The Hope).<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>  Levine, like the Jewish fliers before him, had embodied, however fleetingly, the modernist mythology of flight in all its dialectical manifestations of transcendence and materiality, nationality and war, muscularity and militancy, hope and catastrophe. Not only is this the legacy of the steeled body and the muscle Jew, but it represents paradigmatically the challenges and tensions inherent to Jewish modernism.

It achieves this morally [<i>sittlich</i>] through the rejuvenation of the ideals of the Volk and corporeally [<i>k&#x00F6;rperlich</i>] through the physical rearing of one's off spring, in order to create a lost muscular Judaism [<i>Muskeljudenthum</i>] once again." <i>Stenographisches Protokoll der Verhandlungen des II.

Nordau published the first complete call for "Muskeljudentum" in <i>Die J&#x00FC;dische Turnzeitung</i> (June 1900), no. 2, 10&#x2013;11. A follow-up article emphasizing the relationship between gymnastics and health appeared in July of 1902, "Was bedeutet das Turnen f&#x00FC;r uns Juden?" (What does gymnastics mean for us Jews?). Further references to <i>Die J&#x00FC;dische Turnzeitung </i>will be documented parenthetically as JTZ, followed by the year, volume, and page number.

In their manifesto, the regeneration of the Jewish body played a critical role in ting both anti-Semitism and Jewish self-hatred. To quote from the manifesto: "Physical training has been since the time of the ancient Greeks the most powerful impulse toward forming body and mind. We saw the results in Jahn's and Friesen's training in the Wars of Liberation. We, however, have been barred from these exercises. Our association is to be, first of all, a place for physical training of every kind: gymnastics, fencing, rowing, and swimming. We have to t with all our energy against the odium of cowardice and weakness which is cast on us. We want to show that every member of our association is equal to every Christian fellow-student in any physical exercise and chivalry. Physical strength and agility will increase self-confidence and self-respect, and in the future nobody will be ashamed of being a Jew."

As we will see below, there is an intimately dialectical connection between warfare and masculinity in World War I: On the one hand, trench warfare was imagined by certain German nationalist proponents, such as Ernst J&#x00FC;nger, to give birth to new, technologically steeled men "loaded with overflowing manliness." <i>Der Kampf als Inneres Erlebnis</i> in: <i>S&#x00E4;mtliche Werke: Essays I, Betrachtungen zur Zeit</i>, vol 7 (Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1980), 19.

<p id="lead">At the beginning of the twentieth century, European artists created works evincing their fascination with what they called the "tribal" or the "primitive," a trend that has been studied thoroughly by art historians over the past few decades.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  While primitivism has been seen primarily as an art historical category, modernist writers were also inspired by the ideal of the primitive, which they associated with vitality and energy, as opposed to what they considered to be the decadence and decay of their own world. They found examples of the primitive in distant places such as Africa and Polynesia and in the distant past of their own or other nations, and they reached out to it in various ways in their writing. In this paper, I consider the paradoxical status of the Jews in regard to literary primitivism. On the one hand, they might be seen as an ancient people, identified with the past of the Hebrew Bible, or as an Eastern people, preserving a mystical religion (Hasidism) and a patriarchal way of life in their <i>shtetlakh</i>.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  On the other, they might be imagined as the consummate moderns, ably adapting to the capitalist system and fully at home in urban space.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  How did Jewish writers grapple with this conundrum in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century? In confronting it, did they create a specifically Jewish form of modernism?<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  I respond to these questions by examining the writings of and the myths surrounding a Russian and Yiddish writer, revolutionary, and ethnographer, S. An-sky (Shloyme-Zanvl Rappoport, 1863&#x2013;1920), author of the play <i>The Dybbuk </i>, the cornerstone of the modern Hebrew and Yiddish theatrical repertoires. This endeavor involves shifting the geographic focus from the art of Western Europe to the Russian empire 

<b></b>

 (and, as a counterexample, the United States), where both the Jews and modernism developed along distinct paths. </p>

<p>Literary criticism on primitivism has developed in recent years and conflicting arguments have emerged about it. Some scholars focus on the political implications of representations of colonized peoples by writers from colonial powers, while others counter the postcolonial critique with the insistence that modernist writers inevitably represent the West as well as the exotic other as "a play of projections, doublings, idealizings, and rejections of a complex, shifting otherness."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In the view of Marjorie Perloff, "It is the essence of modernism &#x2026; that it encodes the uncertainties of [the dialogical nature of the ethnographic encounter] at the heart of its procedural self-consciousness."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  That is, Perloff argues that modernist writers were deeply concerned with the contradictions produced by their own self-representations vis-&#x00E0;-vis the primitive subject.  </p>

<p>In her nuanced revision of the critical debate around modernist primitivism, Perloff cites Russian examples (Gumilev, Akhmatova), and her conclusions are particularly germane for the Russian context. In the Russian Empire and Eastern Europe&#x2014;as in the United States&#x2014;modernist writers were consumed by issues of national identity. Slavic modernists worked to re-anchor that identity in folklore and depictions of the local primitive. Stylization&#x2014;or, as Alexander Ogden points out, the slightly different Russian term, <i>stilizatsiia</i>, meaning "the purposeful reproduction of <i>someone else's style</i> as a defined aesthetic and ideological position in a new artistic context"<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> &#x2014;was an important tactic for the Russian modernists, who refashioned their poems and prose, and often even their speech and dress, after now one, now another model chosen from other times and places.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The sense that life was like text and could be refashioned according to aesthetic criteria typified the era. The literary historian Alexander Lavrov notes that the "most characteristic feature of the Symbolist attitude toward reality" was "to perceive the world as a quasi-artistic phenomenon, to attribute to reality the qualities of an artistic text."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The Russian modernists were not, in fact, doing anything new in imitating peasant styles of speech and behavior; after all, the realist or naturalist writers of the generation before had done so as well. As Ogden observes, the notion of an elite borrowing folkways evokes many images in the Russian context:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Slavophiles mimicking peasant dress, the mindset of the 'repentant nobleman' articulated by Nikolai Mikhailovskii, Alexander Blok's bowing down at the height of his celebrity before an unknown peasant writer (Nikolai Kliuev), and the <i>ukhod</i> (departure) to join the narod [folk] on the part of Aleksandr Dobroliubov, Leonid Semonov, or Lev Tolstoi himself.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Among the many examples of literary stylization in Russia, primitivism developed most strongly in the years from 1908 to 1913 among Futurist writers and painters. Futurist theorists such as Alexander Shevchenko and Natalya Goncharova were troubled by the thought that in turning toward the primitive, they might be imitating Western European artists, and they sought to claim native, "Eastern" sources. Goncharova asserted, "Now I shake the dust from my feet and leave the West, considering its vulgarizing significance trivial and insignificant&#x2014;my path is toward the source of all arts, the East."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The Futurists defined the art of the "East" broadly, from Slavic village culture 

<b></b>

 to the mysterious, ancient "stone women" that dot the steppes to the native cultures of Siberia, with particular interest in the shamanistic art and rituals of the Buryats and other peoples.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Their works typify the fascination of Russian modernists with Siberia, drawing on a number of tendencies in the Russian cultural imagination. The lure of Siberia was particularly strong in the early 1910s, precisely when An-sky was writing his first, Russian drafts of <i>The Dybbuk</i>.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It is not surprising that when Jewish writers such as An-sky began writing fiction in Russian, they, like the Russian writers on whom they modeled themselves, experimented with primitivist stylization. The best-known example of this is Isaac Babel, whose <i>Red Cavalry Stories</i> chronicle precisely a Jewish Red Army officer's attempts to stylize his speech and behavior on the model of the Cossacks with whom he worked. But more than the Futurists, more than Mikhailovsky, Blok, Tolstoy, or Dobroliubov, Babel drenched his primitivism in irony, pausing repeatedly to gesture toward the absurdity and improbability of his narrator's efforts at self-refashioning.  </p>

<p>Both Babel's primitivism and his irony resemble those of the Jewish writers at the other margin of Europe, American Jews who experimented with American Indian images. American Jewish writers in English and Yiddish, from Nathanael West and Henry Roth to the Russian-born Abraham Cahan and An-sky's friend Chaim Zhitlowsky, juxtaposed images of native American clothing, songs, bodies, rituals to images of Jewish clothing, songs, bodies, and rituals. The poet Yehoash translated Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's faux epic <i>Hiawatha</i> into Yiddish, and Zhitlowsky wrote a preface in which he defended the project of translation from European languages into Yiddish in general and argued for the significance of <i>Hiawatha</i> in particular, as a way to give the Jewish reader access to nature, "general-human poetry," and empathy for all humanity.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Alan Trachtenberg, in a book on the functions of <i>Hiawatha</i> in American culture, notes that American Jews used this particular mock-Indian poem to imagine themselves differently.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  As Rachel Rubinstein points out, Native Americans could function "as a flexible, unfixed signifier that could address, embody or challenge certain ideas of what it meant to be both a modern and a native American. &#x2026; [Through] the binding together, against the grain, of Indian and Jew, [Jewish American writers] could imaginatively inhabit the bodies both of Indians and aspirers to Indianness, both natives and aliens, primitives and moderns."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Fully recognizing the attendant paradoxes, they "engaged in a conversation about the possibilities for a modern, national literature."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Such writers exemplify the modernist irony about the primitive that Perloff describes. Rubinstein reads the interest of American Jewish writers in Native Americans&#x2014;particularly the decision of the editors of the Yiddish literary periodical <i>Shriftn</i> (first published in 1912 and associated with the modernist poetry group, Di Yunge) to include Yiddish translations of Indian chants&#x2014;as on the one hand a way of participating in a general American modernist use of Native American images and on the other a way to challenge that modernism's assumption that Jews could not belong to a truly native-based American literature. She sees <i>Shriftn</i> as attempting "to initiate a kind of literary dialogue with a young American avant-garde whose purview seemed to leave them out, and which wasn't talking back."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>I now turn to the ways in which An-sky himself and his memoirists engaged in a similar kind of dialogue by linking up images of Jews with images of another primitivist fascination, the peoples of Siberia.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  An-sky's most overtly primitivist text is his signature work, <i>The Dybbuk</i>. The question of whether or not <i>The Dybbuk</i> is a modernist play mattered for its first critics. A drama set in a shtetl, it has been seen as evidence of the cultural maturation of the Jews of Eastern Europe, in spite of its plot that valorizes the past over the present. To summarize it, the hero Khonen and heroine Leah were promised to each other in marriage before their birth, but after Khonen is orphaned, Leah's wealthy father forgets his promise and seeks a well-off groom for his daughter. The young couple yearns for each other, and after Khonen dies, his soul possesses the body of his beloved; she speaks in his voice&#x2014;but also, it seems, for herself&#x2014;in rejecting the groom her father has chosen. A mysterious "Messenger" appears at key points in the play to explain the mystic significance of what has occurred. Khonen and Leah's rebellion against the father is also a revolt against the centrality of money and for an older set of values. Written first in Russian between 1913 and 1919 and produced after An-sky's death in Yiddish in 1920 by the Vilna Trupe in Poland and in 1922 in Haim Nahman Bialik's Hebrew translation by the Habima theater in Soviet Russia, this play demonstrated that theater in Jewish languages and on Jewish themes could appeal to enthusiastic audiences, Jewish and non-Jewish, religious and secular, high-, middle-, and low-brow.  </p>

<p>Seth Wolitz argues that <i>The Dybbuk</i> appeared so satisfyingly up-to-date in the 1920s because it offered a Jewish-themed example of the theatrical trends of the era, in particular the mystical, Symbolist theater of Maurice Maeterlinck and Richard Wagner.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In St. Petersburg in the first decades of the twentieth century, as An-sky drafted the play, Maeterlinck's <i>Pell&#x00E9;as et M&#x00E9;lisande</i> was performed in a new translation by the Symbolist poet Valery Briusov; Stanislavsky's student Vsevolod Meierkhol'd staged Wagner's <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> at the Mariinsky theater; and An-sky's friend Fedor Sologub wrote mystical, folkloric plays about love and death. An-sky reported that when Stanislavsky read <i>The Dybbuk</i> for the Moscow Art Theater, he praised precisely its mysticism as "more original than the mysticism of Maeterlinck," and Sologub saw An-sky's play as a new, "true and unique form of theatrical mystery play."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  It seems logical to understand An-sky as deliberately fashioning a Jewish theatrical modernism, plugging Jewish folkloric images into a format he admired on the Petersburg stage, following Sologub, Maeterlinck, and Stanislavsky in trying to turn the theater into a quasi-religious experience and a mystical portal to other worlds. The Russian Symbolists, the dominant modernist school in Russia in the first decade of the twentieth century, believed that art should play this mystical function, and an excess of this kind of trendy mysticism was precisely the critique that Zionist writers leveled against An-sky's play at a mock trial in Palestine in 1926.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>   </p>

<p>However, this view of <i>The Dybbuk</i> contradicts much of what we know about An-sky himself. A one-time prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; of the Populist writer Gleb Uspensky, An-sky retained the Russian Populist suspicion of art-for-art's-sake; he consistently advocated realist literature and theater that would improve the lives of the masses, rather than simply 

<b></b>

 entertaining urban elites (such as the Symbolists and their circles).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  He himself seemed to find it difficult to reconcile his artistic politics with the fashionable mysticism that readers found in <i>The Dybbuk</i>. Even as he happily repeated Stanislavsky and Sologub's praise, he wrote to the brilliant, unpredictable intellectual Zhitlowsky, that he had not set out to write a mystical play.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>My play, needless to say, is a realist drama about mystics. Its only non-realist element is the Messenger, not Leah's dialogue or visions. I've deliberately limned the Messenger with mystical features. Actually, he was not in my original version. It was Stanislavsky who advised or rather told me to add him, and I thereby automatically broadened my original conception, adding a higher level beyond the theme of the 'lovely and pleasant.'<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Although he admitted that in taking Stanislavsky's suggestion, he gave his play a mystical level, An-sky was skeptical that the play as a whole was the sort of mystic drama the Symbolists created. As he argues, he believed that <i>The Dybbuk</i> was fundamentally realist, with all the <i>engag&#x00E9;</i> political implications of that category in Russia.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>   </p>

<p>An-sky's letter to Zhitlowsky makes it difficult to categorize his play as modernist based on its Symbolism and mysticism. Thus I propose understanding his modernism as primarily primitivist, and thinking about the meanings that adhered in An-sky's time to the identification of Jews with a primitive people, specifically with Siberian natives. In An-sky's conversations, essays, and experiences over his adult life, he returned to images of Siberia and Siberian peoples, each with its own set of meanings: Nietzschean, pedagogic, imperialist, and revolutionary. After surveying An-sky's Siberian encounters, I consider <i>The Dybbuk</i> as a stylized, "Siberianized" representation of Jewish culture, before concluding with a late essay where An-sky questions the value of the primitive fantasy&#x2014;whether for Jews or anyone else. In the process, I hope to offer a new and nuanced picture of Jewish modernism.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Shashkov
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Let us begin with a depiction of An-sky himself as a Jew refashioned into a Siberian native. In a memoir set in the early 1890s, two decades before An-sky began to write <i>The Dybbuk</i>, Zhitlowsky recalls a discussion of his own ideas about a renewal of Jewish mass culture by means of folk culture.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Zhitlowsky portrays An-sky as fascinated by this nationalist dream and tentatively sympathetic to it, able to appreciate it in an aesthetic sense even though he could not commit himself to it ideologically. According to Zhitlowsky, An-sky said that if he ever did decide "to return to the Jewish people," he would do it "completely (&#x2026;) like Shashkov." This statement stimulates Zhitlowsky to a meditation on Siberian primitivism and its implications for modern Jews. Shashkov, Zhitlowsky explains, was a Siberian writer, "a Yakut or Buryat or from some other half-wild tribe in wide Siberia." He enjoyed a successful literary career in St. Petersburg, but suddenly "left the heights of civilized life and returned to his Yakuts or Buryats in Siberia and became 'savage' again with them. Together with them he got drunk, in yurts, 

<b></b>

 together they cried out their folksongs in voices that seemed possessed. He even threw off his European clothes and went around, like his brothers, overgrown and dirty. 'He became Buryat (or Yakut), once and for all.'<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  &#x2026; European civilization &#x2026; was just an outer coat of lacquer, while inside he remained the same wild Buryat." </p>

<p>Zhitlowsky then offers three explanations for Shashkov's (and, implicitly, An-sky's) return to folk culture. One is that people are uneducable. He offers as proof first a Talmudic line ("No matter how you throw the stick, it will land on its root"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> ) and then a Russian proverb ("No matter how much you feed the wolf, he still looks back at the forest"<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> ). That is, no matter how thoroughly a non-Russian masters the outward forms of Russian culture, he can never become Russian. The flaw is not in Russian culture, but rather in its student, who can never eradicate the desire to return to the "forest" of his native culture, even though its inferiority may be obvious. Zhitlowsky's second explanation shifts the blame to Russian culture. Although the Shashkov he describes had once imagined Russian culture as superior to Buryat (or Yakut) culture, he then realizes that "the forms of civilized life are quite insignificant surface things, that the heart of humanness can be better attained when one allows oneself to fall into the mysterious depths of one's own soul and when one molds oneself mystically there with the world-spirit that prevails in it." By returning to his Buryat (or Yakut) ways, savage though they might seem to an outsider, Shashkov could get at something that Russians, with their sophistication, could never attain; it follows that An-sky, with his return to the Jewish folk, could do the same thing. In his third reading of the story, Zhitlowsky derives an ethical imperative. The most important thing, he asserts, is not mastery of a Western culture, but rather "compassion and love" for one's own people. Shashkov&#x2014;and by extension An-sky and any other subaltern intellectual&#x2014;should choose to go back to the people of his origin, rather than remaining in the metropolis and aping the ruling classes. This return, Zhitlowsky suggests, is a mystical act, a key into "mysterious depths." At the end of the anecdote, Zhitlowsky abruptly switches genres, turning An-sky from a repentant son into a passionate lover:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Perhaps love for his own people had risen in him to the level that is sung about in the wonderful Yiddish song, 'Tell me, you beautiful girl' [Zog mir, du sheyn meydele], where the lover is ready to take on the most difficult things for his beloved, 'So long as I can be together with you' [Abi mit dir ineynem zayn]? Let it be wild, let it be dirty, let it stink, 'So long as I can be together with you.' &#x2026; His remark &#x2026; that he would return 'like Shashkov' meant, therefore, that he would cleave to the Jewish people entirely, in his practices and his beliefs, no matter what they consisted of, no matter how far they might be from our own ideas about progressive human life: 'So long as I can be together with you.'<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Zhitlowsky's metaphors merit further investigation, as do his facts. His inability to distinguish between Buryats (a largely Buddhist people in Southeastern Siberia) and Yakuts (a mostly shamanistic people far away in Northeastern Siberia) suggests that his information might not be reliable. And indeed, the real Serafim Serafimovich Shashkov (1841&#x2013;1882) was a writer from Irkutsk who published in liberal journals in St. Petersburg but had trouble making a living. He went back to Siberia to teach and 

<b></b>

 lecture, returned to St. Petersburg, was exiled to Shenkursk (near the Arctic Circle), and died there of tuberculosis. As his name and patronymic suggest, he was neither Buryat nor Yakut but ethnically Russian, the son of a Russian Orthodox priest.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Zhitlowsky (or An-sky in their conversation) may have confused Shashkov himself with characters from Shashkov's writings. In a historical essay, Shashkov described the fates of two Siberian intellectuals, the Buryat Dordzhi Bandzarov and the Kirghiz Sultan Chekkan-Chinghisovich Valikhanov:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Bandzarov, when he went to Irkutsk, began to associate in a friendlier and friendlier way with ignorant and dirty lamas, whom he had earlier despised, he practically converted back to Buddhism, although he had not formerly been a believer, he began to drink, and he drank himself to death! &#x2026; Meanwhile, Valikhanov &#x2026; contracted tuberculosis and was obligated to go to the steppe, where tuberculosis killed him. This was the fate of the two Siberian natives who were the only ones to receive a European education!<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Unlike the real Shashkov, who finds the fate of Bandzarov and Valikhanov tragic, Zhitlowsky discovers inspiration and beauty in the story of return to the Far East. His metaphor of An-sky (or "Shashkov") as the prodigal son, diving back into the yurt, echoes not just the Russian fashion for Siberian mysticism and shamanism and the broader European enthusiasm for Nietzschean self-re-creation, but the specifically Russian Symbolist admiration of a person who rejects ordinary bourgeois behavior for an entirely new way of acting.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Zhitlowsky's characterization of An-sky as a Jewish Shashkov falls short as fact, fundamentally based as it is on a case of mistaken identity, but it offers significant evidence about the meaning of the connection between Siberian and Jewish images. Zhitlowsky's memoir of his friend&#x2014;written in the United States in the 1930s&#x2014;indicates that when he sought out metaphors for a situation in which an acculturated Jew such as An-sky "returns" to the folk by, among other achievements, writing a popular play on folk themes, he found Siberian images ready and waiting. His use of them demonstrates that just as American Jewish modernist writers were drawn to experiment with identifying American Jews and Native Americans, so it seemed to make sense to identify Russian Jews with Siberian natives, in the service of a modernist project. Zhitlowsky's Siberian primitivism here recalls the ideology of the critics of <i>The Dybbuk,</i> who sought in the exotic a mystic access to other worlds. </p>

"Eskimos" in Bordeaux
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The Buryat (or Yakut) who Zhitlowsky describes joyously tearing off his Western clothes, running back into his yurt, drinking, dancing, and singing wild songs with his Siberian brothers, is evidently a fantasy. But in his ecstatic prose poem identifying the Siberian primitive with a renewed Jewish identity, Zhitlowsky touched on questions that were crucial for An-sky during a formative period in his life, the eight years (1892&#x2013;1900) that he spent in Paris. There An-sky encountered and produced Siberian images with meanings quite different from those Zhitlowsky found&#x2014;meanings related to science, empire, and radical utopia. An-sky worked in Paris as a journalist, literary agent, revolutionary 

<b></b>

 activist, and the private secretary of Petr Lavrov, a Populist theorist and the <i>eminence grise</i> of the radical Russian emigration. Through Lavrov, he met Grigory Nikolaevich Potanin, the best known Siberian writer, explorer, and ethnographer of his time, in Paris to research connections between European literature and Siberian epics. Potanin was a Siberian regionalist, a cultural and political radical who wanted to increase Siberian autonomy and to that end studied native Siberian peoples, wrote about them, and worked to exhibit their cultures.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Soon after they met, Potanin began to share An-sky's small apartment, and long after Potanin had returned to Russia, An-sky hosted his Siberian friends.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  </p>

<p>As an intimate of Potanin's, An-sky was an attentive observer of displays of circumpolar cultures. In Bordeaux in 1900, he found himself at a seedy nightclub, where he was surprised to see what he at first took to be fellow subjects of the Russian Tsar: "Eskimos, men and women in their furs, sat and attentively watched the play." He tried to speak to them in Russian, but they did not understand, nor did they respond to the obscenities of some French guests.  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>They looked [at us] naively and calmly and smiled good-naturedly, understanding nothing. These simple, na&#x00EF;ve faces seemed so good, pure, and sweet next to the soiled faces of the representatives of a higher race and the painted faces of the women. How did they get here? I asked a man who was speaking to them. It turned out that it was he who brought them from Labrador for "shows." He had brought a "whole village" of men, women, and children, 26 people in all. He was also transporting a few dozen American Indians. He had been with them in England, Germany, Austria, and now had come to France. Along with the Eskimos he brought their dogs, yurts, all their poor equipment. So in the garden they had set up a whole Eskimo village rather nicely. During the day the Eskimos give performances, ski, hunt seals, play with balls, shy small coins with whips. The Indians lasso wild horses, sing, and so on. All of this is very poor, very pitiable, and finally offensively cruel.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur, who turned out in conversation to be a serious person, complained that in France there was less interest in these people than anywhere else.</p>
<p>"You see, that's all they care about. They speak to them in obscenities, they bother the women. In Germany there was much more interest. Scholars, anthropologists looked at them with a lot of interest. &#x2026; &#x2026;</p>
<p>"They don't suffer from the heat too much?"</p>
<p>"Terribly. It's sad to watch. Two already died &#x2026; and their bodies were sent back to Labrador. That was the agreement. &#x2026; You know, they're like children, they don't understand what's going on around them, but they are very wise, calm, kind, and warm-hearted. They are dying out. Now there are only 3,000 of them. There are only 2,000 words in their language. But they have learned how to speak. But they are confusing English and French words. You see that girl over there?" He pointed at a three-year-old girl. "She is the daughter of a French officer and an Eskimo woman. A remarkably talented and intelligent child."</p>

<p class="continued">These "Eskimos"&#x2014;presumably Labrador Inuits from Eastern Canada&#x2014;may have had some distant connection to Siberia: archeologists believe that their ancestors immigrated to North America from Asia. 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>An-sky's reactions to the exhibition of Labrador Inuits in Bordeaux display the differences between his and Zhitlowsky's attitudes toward the primitive. On the one hand, An-sky's words recall Zhitlowsky's ecstatic appreciation of "Shashkov." He presents the Inuits as virtuous precisely by contrast with the French: their faces seemed "so good, pure, and sweet next to the soiled faces of the representatives of a higher race and the painted faces of the women." This sounds like the ideal Zhitlowsky identified with An-sky himself, the fantasy of a Western intellectual who decides to abandon degenerate modern culture to return to an idealized folk. On the other hand, An-sky does not simply admire the Inuits' "naivet&#x00E9;" and stop there, as Zhitlowsky uncritically relayed the improbable story of "Shashkov." Rather, he inquires into the circumstances that brought the Inuits to Bordeaux, the difficult physical conditions under which they lived, their suffering from the heat, and pronounces it all "very poor, very pitiable, and finally offensively cruel." He notes that the Inuits' shows do not even succeed as education: the audience is unmoved by and uninterested in their songs and hunting techniques. Whereas both An-sky and Zhitlowsky described the contrast between what they saw as Western decadence and primitive purity, An-sky's focus on the flaws of the potentially pedagogic encounter between Frenchmen and Inuits complicates the picture and suggests that An-sky's primitivism was more nuanced. Rather than imagining that display or knowledge of a primitive group could simply infuse energy and purity into a decadent Western culture, An-sky was intrigued by the ways in which that encounter turned out to be abortive or blocked. Tellingly, unlike Zhitlowsky who confused Buryats, Yakuts, and the real Shashkov, An-sky quickly noted his own mistake in confusing the Labrador Inuits with Eskimos from the Russian Empire. As in his other writings, An-sky avoided oversimplification and expressed ambivalence about the dichotomy of primitive versus degenerate (he also questioned his era's certainty that French culture was degenerate).<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  </p>

<p>It is not surprising that An-sky wrote with such interest about the effectiveness of ethnographic exhibits. The Russian &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; community in which he lived was composed largely of students or would-be students, many, like An-sky, fascinated by the social sciences and especially by the radical theory of the time.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  An-sky observed the founding of the International Institute of Sociology by R&#x00E9;n&#x00E9; Worms in 1894 and was close to one of the participants, M. M. Kovalevsky, a Russian historian and jurist who had publicly criticized the tsar and been forbidden to continue teaching in Russia.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  An-sky himself worked among Russian social scientists in the Russian pavilion at the 1900 Paris World's Fair.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  His memoirs indicate that this exhibit involved cooperation between antagonistic forces: the Tsarist government, anxious to display the Empire's economic and political strength as impressively as possible, and the radical &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; community (on whom the Russian secret police kept strict tabs) that apparently staffed the exhibit. </p>

<p>This exhibit, so big that it was housed not on the rue des Nations but at the Trocad&#x00E9;ro, contrasts intriguingly with the display of Inuits at the nightclub in Bordeaux. Although the Bordeaux entrepreneur had few resources beyond the bodies of his captives and the Trocad&#x00E9;ro exhibitors could draw on the fabled riches of the tsars, both conceived of the far Northeast as the proper subject of display. The Russian pavilion included 

<b></b>

 architectural elements meant to evoke the Southern and Eastern edges of the Empire (a Turkish kiosk, a pagoda). At the pavilion of Asiatic Russia, visitors sat in a train car meant to represent the Trans-Siberian Railroad, which was under construction since 1891 (it would be completed in 1905). Using something like a form of early cinema, painted scenes of the Caucasus, the steppes, and Siberia passed in front of the windows. A visitor remembered, "We crossed great rivers dotted with floating logs, traversed huge forests of pine and larch, sped through vast deserts strewn with Mongol tombs." At the end a Chinese boy served jasmine tea and shouted, "Peking!"<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  The impressive display of Siberian landscapes at the World's Fair recalls the sad performances of the Labrador Inuits in Bordeaux: In both cases, An-sky was part of a crowd that witnessed the mobilization of images of the north in the service of a kind of cultural pedagogy. While the Bordeaux display endeavored to attract interest in the residents of the polar region (not, as An-sky complained, all that effectively), the World's Fair pavilion displayed northern landscapes with the evident goal of impressing the viewer with the physical vastness and natural resources of the Empire. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
"In the beginning, people were already born married"
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Whereas the display of a circumpolar people represented science or education for the Bordeaux entrepreneur and the display of northern landscape represented power at the World's Fair, for the sociologists in An-sky's own circles, Siberia stood for the questions at the heart of the <i>Dybbuk's</i> plot: marriage, family structure, and the tension between old and new ways of life.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  The Siberian landscapes that rolled past the train windows at the Russian pavilion depicted an area rich in resources but unpopulated; the imperial painters neglected to picture the native peoples of Siberia or the many colonists who had arrived from Russia. Least of all did they care to represent the residents of Siberia who had the most in common with An-sky: the political exiles. Following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 by members of the Populist group Narodnaia Volia (People's Will), his nervous successor, Alexander III, rounded up Populists at the slightest provocation and sent them East. Populism encouraged the study of peasant culture&#x2014;not just peasants' statements about their likelihood to support revolution, but also their songs, costumes, and rituals&#x2014;and many of the exiled radicals were amateur ethnographers who were reading the same social theorists as their friends in Paris. Once these young men found themselves isolated among Siberian peoples, they refocused their ethnographic energies on them.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Lev Shternberg, exiled to Sakhalin, wrote a monograph about the Gilyak (or Nivkh); Vladimir Bogoras, the Chukchi; Vladimir Iokhel'son, the Yugakir. The radical ideology of these writers accounted for what they found in Siberia. As Populists, they were already convinced of the significance of the peasants for their dream of Russia's revolutionary future. They were certain that <i>pace</i> Marx's vision of an industrial proletariat leading the world to communism, in Russia's case the rural folk, recalling their own traditionally communal institutions, would embrace the revolutionary cause. When men such as Shternberg, Bogoras, and Iokhel'son encountered the Siberian peoples, they found even more inspirational evidence of communal institutions. 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>The enthusiastic discovery of proto-communist institutions in Siberia is best exemplified by the intellectual interactions between Friedrich Engels and Shternberg. Arrested in 1886, Shternberg was in jail when he read Engels's 1884 book, <i>The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</i> (actually a cellmate translated it aloud for him from the German).<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  There Engels argued that the variety of family structures found throughout the world can be plotted in an evolutionary sequence, proving that humans had evolved from a matriarchal and communal system to a patriarchal and capitalist one. In the process, women had turned from respected workers into powerless slaves, the property of their husbands: "The overthrow of mother-right was the <i>world historical defeat of the female sex</i>. The man took command in the home also; the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  The contemporary institution of monogamous marriage replaced the polygamy of the past because it could ensure patrilineal descent and thereby protect the property of men. As Engels explains: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In the beginning, people were already born married&#x2014;married to an entire group of the opposite sex&#x2026;. And when, with the preponderance of private over communal property and the interest in its bequeathal, father-right and monogamy gained supremacy, the dependence of marriage on economic considerations became complete&#x2026;. Not only the woman but also the man acquires a price&#x2014;not according to his personal qualities, but according to his property.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Although the bulk of Engels's examples came from North American Indian groups, he also found evidence for his theories in the Russian Empire and the Slavic sphere. In his revised 1891 fourth edition, he cited An-sky's friend Kovalevsky, whose work showed that communal familial organizational structures still existed among Slavs.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Inspired by Engels, Shternberg knew what to look for when he arrived on Sakhalin. And to his delight, he found it: evidence in the kinship terms of the Gilyak that they still practiced a form of plural marriage, namely cousin marriage, whereby children are assigned before birth (or at their birth once it becomes clear whether they are girls or boys) to specific cross-cousins as spouses. Shternberg wrote an article about his findings that was published in Russian in 1892, and Engels was overjoyed to read it. He arranged for its publication in German and eventually included a discussion of Shternberg's work as an appendix to a revised edition of his own book.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Both the image of betrothal of infants before or at birth (which the Gilyak actually practiced) and the image of plural marriage (which they did not) represented for Shternberg and Engel the powerful vision of a society in which the claims of groups (or families) take precedence over the claims of individuals and accumulated wealth has no effect on human fates. The fantasies he associated with Gilyak marriage practices must have given the exiled Shternberg the sense that his own suffering on Sakhalin had a tremendous meaning, allowing him&#x2014;and eventually his readers&#x2014;the hope that since these communal institutions still existed, even in the most remote part of the world, it might be possible for people everywhere to return to that seemingly so much more virtuous form of life.

The Dybbuk
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Given the interest in Siberian natives expressed in An-sky's conversations and writing, it seems worthwhile to speculate about the meaning of Siberian primitivist imagery for him and his work. Zhitlowsky's comparison of his friend to "Shashkov" represents speculation of just this sort. Following Zhitlowsky, I will offer four readings of <i>The Dybbuk</i> as stylized in Siberian fashion, and consider what they offer&#x2014;both individually and taken together&#x2014;to the project of understanding Jewish modernism.  </p>

<p>I begin with Zhitlowsky's vision of Jewish culture, like Siberian culture, as a primitive source of mystic wholeness, to which the assimilated intellectual needs to return. He makes this argument about the play, as well as about An-sky himself in his discussion of "Shashkov." In his introductory note to the English translation, he explained that An-sky had succeeded in recreating the "richness of spirit" associated with the mystical Jewish movement of Hasidism, characterized above all by "the longing to fuse the soul with the divine Source of the world ... [to release oneself] through holy living from the illusory world, and [to attain] the True World of mystic powers." He lauded the Hasidim for living "a life hovering on the boundary between two worlds, the world of reality and the faith-created world of supernatural forces."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  This description of an artist who succeeds in penetrating from the ordinary world of everyday life into a mysterious, fascinatingly primitive other world recalls Zhitlowsky's vision of Shashkov's equally mystical national reawakening, when he realizes that "the forms of civilized life are quite insignificant surface things, that the heart of humanness can be better attained when one allows oneself to fall into the mysterious depths of one's own soul and when one molds oneself mystically there with the world-spirit that prevails in it." Zhitlowsky's language here owes much to the Russian Symbolists as well as to Nietzsche, whose <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> he had translated into Yiddish<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup> . Moreover, his evaluation of An-sky and his memoir points to the connections between the primitivism he celebrated and the mysticism that Stanislavsky and Sologub found in the play. </p>

<p>But this is not the only way of relating An-sky's Jewish primitivism to the Siberian model. To draw on a different set of Siberian images, <i>The Dybbuk</i> might be seen as representing Jewish culture with the same goals as the second of An-sky's encounters with the far North, the entrepreneur displaying Inuits in Bordeaux for (as he argued) educational purposes. As Benjamin Lukin explains, An-sky was increasingly interested in the project of creating a Jewish museum precisely during the period when he wrote the play. He wanted to study, preserve, and display all aspects of traditional Jewish life, folklore, rituals, history, and artifacts, both in order to nourish a strong secular Jewish identity among assimilating Russian Jews, and in order to foster understanding and sympathy among non-Jews, something that seemed particularly urgent in the light of the negative publicity about Jews during the Beilis blood libel trial of 1911&#x2013;1913.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Indeed, the first known Russian draft of the play reveals that An-sky started out by loading up his play with folklore and customs, making it into a living ethnographic diorama suitable for display at a World's Fair.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  The action pauses as his characters sing songs, tell folktales that are sometimes irrelevant to the plot, and enact rituals, such as a scene in which Leah marks her impending wedding by giving a hand-sewn shirt to 

<b></b>

 Baba Khana, the midwife who attended her birth. Baba Khana responds by donning the shirt, singing a song, and offering passers-by cookies from a tray; they take them and give her coins in return.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Rather than a classic play with a unified theme, <i>The Dybbuk</i>&#x2014;particularly in draft form&#x2014;recalls the Bordeaux Inuits, who, as we recall, gave performances, skied, hunted seals, sang, and so forth. An-sky's Bordeaux notes make it clear that he was troubled by this kind of performance and questioned its pedagogical value, and in his revisions of his own play, he ultimately drew back from this sort of ethnographic vaudeville (he removed the midwife and her song, for instance). Nonetheless, the pedagogic intent that he discerned in Bordeaux remained in his play, and it is likely that he hoped in his own work to do a better job than the ethnographic entrepreneur he had met. </p>

<p>While one might not expect that An-sky's plays on Jewish themes would fill the same function as the third of our Siberian representations&#x2014;the World Fair's illustration of the cultural variety and thus implicitly the size and power of the Russian Empire&#x2014;Seth Wolitz makes precisely this argument. He asserts that An-sky was an "Empire Jew," whose articulation of Jewish culture was predicated on Jews being one of many ethnic groups making up the heterogeneous Empire; he argues that An-sky was ideologically committed, in spite of his radicalism, to that very Empire, and most powerfully to its heterogeneity. In his persuasive and original reading of <i>The Dybbuk</i>, Wolitz defines <i>The Dybbuk</i> as belonging "to the conscious creation of a secular Jewish East European identity as part of the Russian empire's authentic nationalities." He locates elements of the play that display the rootedness of the Jews and work to represent Jews as one of a set of nations of the Empire, each different but each in place.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting way in which the depiction of Jewish culture in <i>The Dybbuk</i> mirrors Siberian primitivism has not yet been explored in the criticism: the connections between the plot of the play and the radical hope to find Siberian examples of a communalist past. Although An-sky was friendly with Kovalevsky,<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  read Engels with interest,<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  and worked with Shternberg on the design of the questionnaire for his own ethnographic expedition to the provinces of Volhynia and Podolia in 1912&#x2013;1914,<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  there is no record in his published or private writing that he consciously engaged with the radical meaning of Siberia, that is, with the notion that Siberia and its people contain the best living examples of the communalism of the past and thus might give hope for the revival of communalism in the future. Nonetheless, I would like to speculate about the possibility that these connections and the general ideological atmosphere in which An-sky functioned are reflected in <i>The Dybbuk</i>, which thus might combine modernism and radical politics. </p>

<p>The love plot, as we recall, is based on the promise made by Leah and Khonen's fathers, Sender and Nisn, that if the wife of one of them gives birth to a girl and the wife of the other gives birth to a boy, the two children will be married. In the play, Nisn dies soon after making this promise and before the children are born. Sender, whose wife has given birth to Leah, makes no effort to find out if Nisn's widow had given birth to a boy. After Sender becomes wealthy, he decides to find his daughter a wealthy husband, even though the Hasidim in his town criticize him for abandoning the 

<b></b>

 tradition dictating that a wealthy man should seek out a good scholar as a son-in-law. But ultimately, Leah proves unwilling&#x2014;or unable&#x2014;to go through with the marriage to Menashe, the wealthy groom chosen by her father. Rather, she announces at the end of the second act that she can only marry Khonen, her <i>basherter</i> (fated one)&#x2014;and she makes this announcement in the voice of Khonen, who has died and whose soul has possessed her body. </p>

<p>This plot, it seems to me, shows the traces of the ideology of Engels and Shternberg. Although Eastern European Jews were known (and powerfully criticized) for betrothing children and for early marriage, betrothal of unborn children was rare or non-existent.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  By making this practice the center of his play, An-sky makes his Jews like the Gilyak, as they appear in Shternberg's descriptions of the system assigning children before birth to cross-cousins as spouses. This equation makes it more possible to imagine the Jewish past as containing the germ of an ancient communalism that&#x2014;like the radicals' fantasy of the Siberian past&#x2014;gives hope for a socialist future. The rebellion of Leah and Khonen thus expresses the potential radicalism of these young people (even if clothed in traditionalism), their yearning for an older system, the "primitive communism" of the past, rather than the capitalist system of the present, with its overwhelming concern with property. And Leah's objection to the groom chosen by her husband makes perfect sense in light of Engels' theories. As Engels argues, in the capitalist system based on money&#x2014;the value that governs Sender's actions&#x2014;women become more like property, owned by fathers and husbands; therefore, it is not surprising that they would prefer the older system.  </p>

<p>I am not arguing here that An-sky's play is a Siberian-style fabrication from start to finish. An-sky was a genuine expert in Jewish folk culture, but in his play, he chose to emphasize aspects of it in a way that reflects the ideology of the anthropologists of his era and his circle. As he began writing <i>The Dybbuk </i>at the end of 1913 and developed a plot that centered on marriage in a traditional society, he may have been influenced by the discussions of archaic marriage practices that had been going on around him for the past twenty years. Just as Shternberg unwittingly distorted the marriage customs of the Gilyak in a way that suggests that the "primitive communism" in which Engels and his followers believed was still extant somewhere, so An-sky in his depictions of traditional Jewish culture made changes that brought it closer to the ideal of the pre-capitalist society and values.  </p>

<p>It may be easier to understand An-sky's urge to display Jewish culture as traditionally anti-capitalist when one recalls that Jews were seen as the quintessential capitalists. Among An-sky's earliest writings are critiques of Jewish businessmen who underpaid or abused their Jewish or non-Jewish workers; as a Populist, he seems to have believed&#x2014;at least when he was young&#x2014;that the Jewish business class posed a danger to the Russian peasants, a danger that needed to be controlled.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Thus the depiction of the capitalist Sender in <i>The Dybbuk</i> as a new element, one in some way foreign to the shtetl, suggests that An-sky was creating a plot that allowed him to grapple with and disarm the prevalent notion of Jews as <i>inherently</i> capitalist and exploitative. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Again, with the depiction of Jewish culture as anti-capitalist as with the depiction of the betrothal of unborn children, I am not arguing that An-sky completely distorted the Jewish culture that he knew, in the interest of a political ideology. Rather, from the enormous sea of Jewish culture, he chose elements that corresponded to his ideas, though he never did so entirely to the exclusion of cultural elements that did not support his ideas. In the first act of the play, the <i>batlonim</i> (regular prayer-readers) in the synagogue are telling stories about Hasidic rebbes who were famous for their wealth, including Dovidl of Talna and Reb Yisroel of Ruzhin: "Reb Yisroel of Ruzhin, of blessed memory, lived like a monarch. An orchestra of twenty-four musicians played at his table and when he traveled his carriage never had less than six horses." The visiting Messenger responds, "The holy Reb Zushe of Annopol was poor all his life: he wore a peasant's blouse tied with a rope around his waist and had to beg for alms. Yet his good deeds were no less worthy than those of the rebbe of Talma or the rebbe of Ruzhin."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  In each of these cases, An-sky's characters are describing real historical res, whose lives gave rise to many legends. Although An-sky presumably preferred the ascetic Zushe of Annopol to the wealthy Yisroel of Ruzhin&#x2014;and the viewer of the play eventually realizes that the Messenger is a more reliable voice than any other in the cast&#x2014;he displays the contradictory variety of Hasidic tradition. </p>

<p>To what degree, then, does the primitivism of <i>The Dybbuk</i> speak for a clear political ideology? Engels read Shternberg's depiction of the Gilyak optimistically: Although he did not imagine a bright future for the Gilyak themselves, he saw Shternberg's "evidence" of cousin marriage as indicating that the human race as a whole was once capable of a kind of communism and thus would be able to evolve toward a brighter future. Should <i>The Dybbuk</i>, with its suggestion that traditional Jewish marriage practices were similarly communal (and not capitalist), be seen as equally optimistic, whether about the fate of the Jews or humanity in general? Leah succeeds in rejecting her father's innovative marriage priorities. The <i>Tsaddik</i> (Hasidic leader) Reb Azriel attempts to annul the betrothal of Leah and Khonen, but he cannot do so. He imposes a punishment on Sender for betraying Nisn's trust, but even that does not restore order in the world of the play. At the end of the fourth act, Leah and Khonen willingly die together. Their death might be seen as the triumph of their communalist ideology over Sender's capitalism. Indeed, the image of revolutionaries who renounce marriage, progeny, sex itself in the name of a higher ideal appears frequently in the radical Russian prose tradition, including Chernyshevsky's <i>What Is to Be Done?</i> and Gorky's <i>Mother</i>.  </p>

<p>But An-sky did not ultimately want to characterize his own work as so simply political. In a 1920 letter to Zhitlowsky, he was uncertain about who in the play could be seen as having won a moral victory. "In the end Khonen and Leah are victorious. But is the <i>tsaddik </i>in the wrong?"<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  If Khonen and Leah stand both for the primitive past and for revolution, then An-sky sounds skeptical here about the redemptive value of that revolution. It seems that even though he toyed with stylizing his Jewish folk culture after the model of the Siberian primitive that so fascinated his friends, An-sky, as he himself recognized, ultimately created a work that was not neatly ideological, that revealed doubt that this primitive would provide a real solution.

We Shed No Blood
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Such pessimism echoes through An-sky's last Siberian-themed article, written after he had stopped working on <i>The Dybbuk</i> and seen his political party, the SRs (Socialist Revolutionaries), first triumph after the February 1917 Revolution and then be chased out of Russia after October. Dying in Warsaw&#x2014;where he had fled&#x2014;An-sky found himself revisiting memories of the 1890s in Paris, returning to the primitivist conceit of the Jews as an Eastern people with mystical access to the "world spirit." He touched on this fantasy in one of the last pieces he ever wrote. In "We Shed No Blood" (Bay undz fargist men nit keyn blut), posthumously published in late 1920, An-sky recalled the most unusual Siberian visitors that Potanin sent him: Avgan Dzhordziev, a Tibetan lama with shaven head and yellow robe, and Buda Rabdanov, his Buryat translator. An-sky hints at a potential equation of the "East" and traditional Judaism: the lama's hat, he tells us, is "something like a <i>shtraymel</i>" (the traditional head covering of Hasidic men), and the title the Buryat uses to address the lama is "like we say Rebbe."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>   </p>

<p>As An-sky, Rabdanov, and the lama strolled through the Paris streets, their conversation turned to criminality. When the lama asked An-sky how criminals were treated "by you" (meaning outside of Tibet), An-sky, ever the social scientist, launched into a disquisition on Western criminal law, concluding with a description of the guillotine. The lama's response, as relayed by Rabdanov, surprised him: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Khamba-lama is very surprised that you shed human blood!"</p>
<p>I must admit that I was a bit embarrassed. The whole time, in my interactions with the lama, I had been feeling like the representative of a higher culture, and now suddenly this question. This half-savage Asian cannot understand how we shed human blood. I began to explain to the lama that a great movement against capital punishment was arising in Europe; this barbaric punishment was already gone in several countries and one could hope that soon it would also be eliminated in France. But my speech made no impression on the lama, and again, through Rabdanov, he repeated, "Khamba-lama is very surprised that you shed human blood."</p>
<p>It occurred to me to ask the lama a question. "And what so you do in Tibet with serious criminals?"</p>
<p>Buda Rabdanov relayed my question. The lama straightened up and spoke proudly.</p>
<p>Buda Rabdanov, who always imitated the lama's motions, then straightened up and said proudly, "Khamba-lama says, 'In Tibet we shed no human blood! Where we live, they are strangled!'"<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>In this essay, An-sky evokes and then mocks the orientalizing metaphors of Siberia as a symbol of Jewish tradition and the East as man's "natural" home, the healthy alternative to a degenerate West. He follows the canonic European high modernist artists who turned to ethnography for inspiration, but his subversion of his own Siberian primitivism recalls the nuanced use of the image of American Indians among American Jewish writers. As Zhitlowsky would do in his memoir, An-sky imagines a rejection of the West and return to "the East," motivated by something like the third of Zhitlowsky's explanations of the Shashkov story: the moral superiority of primitive 

<b></b>

 culture. But with his ironic ending, An-sky steps back from primitivism itself, from the ideology defining return&#x2014;to any East&#x2014;as redemption. He suggests that to attribute higher "civilization" to the seemingly primitive is, ultimately, only dangerous self-delusion. Thus, An-sky's anecdote about the lama's visit to Paris draws attention to the distance between Zhitlowsky's portrayal of his childhood friend as "Shashkov" and An-sky himself, suggesting simultaneously that to read <i>The Dybbuk</i> simply as a radical political statement or as an ideological Jewish primitivist pastiche <i>&#x00E0; la Siberienne</i> would be wrong. Rather, the play&#x2014;and, indeed, An-sky's biography itself&#x2014;might be read as an ironic meditation, both profoundly modernist and quintessentially Jewish, on the limits of primitivism. </p>

On Russian Populist thought, the best source remains Andrzej Walicki, <i>The Controversy over Capitalism: Studies in the Social Philosophy of the Russian Populists</i> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969). While he was writing <i>The Dybbuk</i>, An-sky attended the Congress of Folk Theaters (S"ezd narodnykh teatrov) (for the many ethnicities of the Russian Empire), where he asserted that Yiddish theater must share the fate of the Jewish people, meaning political repression, the Pale, and emigration&#x2014;and presumably, like the people, it must struggle against this fate.

<p id="lead">Unlike other European nations to have embraced the cult of the new in the first decades of the twentieth century, France appears to have failed to produce a significant strain of Jewish literary modernism. Excepting the admittedly complicated cases of Proust, caught between two religions and two centuries,<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  and of proto-surrealist Max Jacob (<i>Le Cornet &#x00E0; d&#x00E9;s</i>, 1917), himself a vocal convert to Roman Catholicism, it may not even have produced a single Jewish modernist writer of stature, if "modernism" is taken narrowly as an aesthetic of rupture whose proper moment falls between the turn of the century and the second postwar. On first appraisal, this failure may appear as an historical accident, a missed rendez-vous that to all intents and purposes should have taken place. Given the sizable population of autochtonous Jews in metropolitan France during the second half of the nineteenth century, given too the momentous waves of westward immigration that from 1881 to 1925 brought more than one hundred thousand Ashkenazi to the bustling urban centers of Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, and Strasbourg (French from 1919),<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  one might surmise that the country was ripe for a literary culture that was both distinctively Jewish and modernist. In the domain of painting, this promise had materialized around Amedeo Modigliani, Jacques Lipschitz, Marc Chagall, and Cha&#x00EF;m Soutine, who arrived between 1905 and 1912 and found themselves grouped under the banner of "l'&#x00C9;cole juive";<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  a generation later, German Jewish intellectuals fleeing fascism and committed to ideology critique, among them Walter Benjamin, 

<b></b>

 would too take up residence in the City of Light, if only en route for the Americas. But the case of Jewish writers in France was, for political and linguistic reasons, fraught with particular ambiguity. </p>

<p>To presume on demographic grounds alone that a Jewish literary modernism should have emerged as France spawned such bold iterations of the new as cubism, fauvism, simultaneism, or Surrealism, is to forget the extent to which Republican ideology dictated what it meant to be French and Jewish in the first place. As historians like Michael Marrus, Pierre Birnbaum, and Esther Benbassa have shown, during the nineteenth century a confessional model of Franco-Judaism took hold in France that fostered cultural integration by relegating ritual (other than Catholic) to the furthest reaches of the private sphere. In a climate where strictly observant Jews were suspected of allegiance to a Nation and a Law other than those of the one and indivisible Republic, only those who accepted Judaism as a localized structure of belief in a larger secular context were in position to placate the Gentile majority. The embrace of state-run secular education and a de-emphasis on religious study and prayer could be parlayed into symbolic and, by extension, economic capital, and if conversion was by no means expected of young Jewish males wishing to join the ranks of the national administration, army, or university, it was not always the least desirable course of action given the disaffection from the sacred many already felt. </p>

<p>For spiritual leaders, the question was at root one of assuring pacific coexistence from a weak minority position. Members of the Consistoire, created by Napoleon I in 1808 to mediate between French Jews and the state, had long believed their constituents' interests to be congruent with, if not identical to, those of the Republic, namely the promotion of equality before the law, tolerance with respect to creed, and freedom of the press.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  This community of interest was thrown into sharp relief by the resurgence of rural and urban anti-Semitism in the 1880s and 1890s and especially the protracted Dreyfus Affair of 1894&#x2013;1906, the effect of which was to divide France into two camps and to fuel anti-Semitic sentiment even as justice was rendered.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In a show of political realism, French rabbis greeted the principle of <i>la&#x00EF;cit&#x00E9;</i> or state secularism, written into law in 1905, as the best available guarantee of minority religious rights. After all, under three earlier political regimes since the 1789 Revolution and the 1791 emancipation of French Jews&#x2014;the first Bourbon Restoration, the Orleanist Monarchy of Louis-Philippe, and the Second Empire&#x2014;, Catholicism had enjoyed official or semi-official status, its followers benefiting from all the advantages state recognition affords.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The French model of integration in place throughout the latter third of the nineteenth century thus made for a normalized Judaism, recast, like Christianity, as an individual creed. The Republic could not suffer to recognize any people, nation or community as such, but only individual, abstract citizens. Native French Jews, especially those having joined the ranks of the bourgeoisie, retreated into their households and places of worship, practicing quietly behind closed doors, on High Holidays, or in some cases not at all. Foreign Jews who had fled pogroms and economic hardship in the Pale and who, seduced perhaps by the Yiddish proverb <i>Lebn vi Got in Frankraych</i> ("To live like God in France"), had settled in France after 1881,<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  were given to understand 

<b></b>

 that the reproduction of <i>shtetl</i> customs would test the tolerance of Gentiles&#x2014;and, no less so, that of their assimilated co-religionaries. These last considered themselves <i>Fran&#x00E7;ais isra&#x00E9;lites</i> rather than <i>Juifs fran&#x00E7;ais</i>, that is, as French patriot-citizens first and foremost, and Jews secondarily.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  This does not mean that signs of judaity were not present on French soil: as many as two-hundred and fifty synagogues were built from the 1789 Revolution to 1914 (<i>TJF</i>, 205), and around them vibrant districts, like the Paris Pletzl or "little square" of the Marais, or the expansive Belleville which straddled four <i>arrondissements</i> in the city's working-class northeast, preserved some of the more tradition-bound aspects of Jewish life, from study-rooms (<i>shuln</i>) and &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; organizations (<i>landsmanshaftn</i>) to Yiddish-language theaters and kosher shops. Ultimately, however, Jewish tradition understood as an entire way of life had little place in defining institutional French Judaism, and hence on the activity of those mostly autochtonous Jewish writers who acted as its public spokespersons. </p>

<p>In an 1908 study of the pamphleteer and historian Alexandre Weill, Robert Dreyfus expressed the situation of Jewish writers in alarmist terms, pointing up the negative effects of integration: "The Jews of France are at present too closely identified with French society and too similar to other French men and women of all groups and walks of life so as to be interested in, or even capable of expressing a distinctly Jewish sensibility, Jewish ideas and tendencies that we find no longer within ourselves."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Whether their aims were political or belle-lettristic, Jewish writers in Third Republic France ran up against a common dilemma: How to address the specificity of Jewish historical experience in a manner that would not be seen as inimical to abstract French universalism? How to speak as a citizen and as a Jew without exposing oneself to tired accusations of double allegiance or unpatriotism? Appeals to Jewish tradition and Jewish history <i>stricto sensu</i> would invariably be considered as particularist. It is hence little surprise that novelists' treatments of modern themes such as exogamy, assimilation, or Zionism<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  had limited impact on French literature proper, hovering at the periphery of public and critical consciousness much as did regional literatures, appreciated mainly for their local color. When one runs through the names of prominent Jewish novelists and poets active in metropolitan France over the first third of the new century&#x2014;Andr&#x00E9; Spire (<i>Po&#x00E8;mes juifs</i>; <i>Quelques Juifs</i>), Edmond Fleg (<i>&#x00C9;coute Isra&#x00EB;l</i>), Jean-Richard Bloch (<i>L&#x00E9;vy</i>, ...<i>Et Cie</i>), Armand Lunel (<i>Nicolo Peccavi</i>)&#x2014;, it is noteworthy how few of these authors are still read today, save in restricted circles; the same goes for Jewish immigrants writing in French such as Josu&#x00E9; J&#x00E9;houda, Pierre Paraf, or Ir&#x00E8;ne N&#x00E9;mirovsky, whose <i>David Golder</i>, on the milieu of Jewish financiers, was a best-selling novel of 1929.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Significantly, among the latter group, only the Moldavian poet-filmmaker Benjamin Fondane had real modernist credentials, as most writers, the Corfu-born ironist Albert Cohen included,<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  tended to prefer nineteenth-century narrative technique and poetic voice to the linguistic and formal innovation we retrospectively associate with a modernism of transgression. To all appearances, then, France's new secular religion, together with the pressing need to combat an anti-Semitism that had become endemic, pushed writers who self-identified as Jewish to discuss above all the place and future of their co-religionaries in modern society rather than look to Judaism to reinvigorate aesthetics. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The upshot of this is that many of those salient traits of Judaism from which modernist authors drew inspiration in <i>Mitteleuropa</i>&#x2014;the poetic potential of aphorism and exegesis, of parable and liturgy, of ritualized forms of memory and mysticism&#x2014;went untapped. A Kafka, a Benjamin, a Babel were, indeed, all but unthinkable in lay Republican France. And while the more tradition-bound Ashkenazic &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9;s were better positioned in principle to synthesize aesthetic modernity and the culture of the Book than were native French Jews, their language of choice in diaspora was not always French, but Russian, German, Rumanian, or Yiddish. For all its modernity, then, civic Franco-Judaism, fettered by emancipatory Republican ideology, generally proved little conducive to Jewish literary modernism. </p>

<p>All of the following suggests that in literary-historical terms, Jewish modernism in France could only have appeared belatedly, in reaction to the <i>ann&#x00E9;es noires</i> of occupation, the discriminatory racial policies of Vichy, the Shoah and its aftermath. In what follows, I want to entertain the unorthodox idea that Georges Perec (1936&#x2013;1982), born in Paris to Polish &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; parents who both perished during the war (the father in June 1940 in a military field hospital, the mother in deportation in 1943), bears some of the promises&#x2014;and perhaps too the contradictions&#x2014;of a belated French Jewish modernism. </p>

<p>This assertion is likely to raise eyebrows for two reasons. First, thanks to his passion for literary gamesmanship, intertextual allusion, and a formalist poetics of constraint developed with the Paris-based writers' and mathematicians' workshop, the Ouvroir de litt&#x00E9;rature potentielle (OuLiPo),<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Perec is widely thought of, in Anglophone countries at least, as a "French postmodernist" much in the same way that Italo Calvino (1923&#x2013;1985), also a member of the OuLiPo, has been described as an Italian one. But if Perec's work, in what John Sturrock calls its "unregenerate materialism" or playful rapport with the stuff of language,<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  strikes many readers as detached from historical reflection, it contains nonetheless, dispersed in projects left as often as not unfinished, a poetics of anamnesis consonant with a modernist ethos of Freud, Proust, and Kafka among others. Perec's poetics of constraint, far from an idle game that exhausts itself in the present time of its execution, is a displaced expression of an originary loss that ties writing to the past through the active work of memory.  </p>

<p>Second, in contrast, for instance, to the Egyptian-born Sephardic writer Edmond Jab&#x00E8;s (1912&#x2013;1991) whose liturgically inspired &#x0153;uvre is equally difficult and rewarding, rarely is Perec described as a Jewish writer in the strong sense, that is, one for whom Judaism is an abiding reference, source of themes, or discursive foundation. Aside from a smattering of occasional pieces and interviews, only in the autobiographical <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i> (<i>W or The Memory of Childhood</i>), published in France in 1975, and in the commentary to <i>R&#x00E9;cits d'Ellis Island</i>, the documentary he wrote and shot with filmmaker Robert Bober in New York in 1979, does the author address his Jewishness. Even then, he does so with a reticence and obliqueness disproportional 

<b></b>

 to the mental distress that the unforgiving axe-blows of History&#x2014;"l'Histoire avec sa grande hache," as he phrases it in <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i><sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> &#x2014;surely caused him as a Jew.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  His best-known novels, which seem to share an investment in the impersonal, autonomous notion of <i>&#x00E9;criture</i> theorized by Roland Barthes in the wake of the New Novel, do not signal themselves as the work of a Jewish author writing for a Jewish public: <i>Les choses</i> (<i>Things,</i> 1965), informed by the language of market sociology and advertising, recounts the dreams and disillusionment of a young Parisian couple captivated by emergent consumer society at the turn of the Gaullist 1960s; <i>La disparition</i>  is a manner of detective story in which a chain of disappearances reflects the narrative's own formal conceit, namely the absence of any occurrences of the letter "e";<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  <i>La vie mode d'emploi</i> (<i>Life A User's Manual</i>, 1978) is a minutely calibrated narrative machine that brings together, under the roof of a single Parisian apartment building, hundreds of fragile and disparate lives consumed by far-fetched, self-destructing projects, and quotations from a vast pantheon of authors from Rabelais and Sterne to Christie, Joyce, and Garc&#x00ED;a M&#x00E1;rquez. Just as "to write" had become, for Barthes, an "intransitive verb" that required no predicate,<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  so too was the designation "writer" so absolute for Perec as to refuse qualification: one was a writer <i>tout court</i>, rather than a French or Jewish one. </p>

<p>Paradoxically, this secular position is what makes Perec's writing reflective of Franco-Jewish experience to begin with, yet for reasons wholly distinct from the ideological ones that drove Jews under the Third Republic to repudiate communitarian withdrawal in view of integration to civil society. Like many other children born on the eve of the war who were spared the fate of their immigrant parents, Perec knew little&#x2014;and, as an adult, remembered even less&#x2014;of the rites his forebears had brought with them from the old country.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  His secularism was the result of wartime circumstances that made continued participation in shared tradition all but impossible. That Perec was circumcised by a <i>mohil</i> (<i>GP</i>, 34) but never bar-mitzvahed is indicative of his generation's compromised historical position. The late 1930s appear retrospectively as the last moment at which bonds to tradition held fast: thereafter, all is consumed in a "mindless mist where shadows swirl," to quote from the epigraph to <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i>, taken from a poem by Perec's mentor, Raymond Queneau.  </p>

<p>Formally, <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i> is a "broken book"<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  in which fragmentary childhood memories recounted in the first person alternate first with the evocation of a mysterious rescue mission off the shores of the Tierra del Fuego, then with minute ethnographic descriptions of W, a totalitarian island society entirely devoted to sport and governed by rules as violent as they are arbitrary. In a much-commented passage from the autobiographical part of the narrative, the author recalls sitting in his grandmother's dry goods shop at age three, surrounded by Yiddish newspapers and a circle of loving family members. "Everyone," he writes, "is in raptures over the fact that I have pointed to a Hebrew character and called it by name: the sign was supposedly shaped like a square with a gap in its lower left-hand corner [&#x2026;] and its name was apparently gammeth, or gammel."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  If this memory at first seems to signal the youth's initiation to the shared knowledge of community, it is revealed thereafter as a fundamental act of 

<b></b>

 misrecognition. In a footnote, one of many to supplement his scant reminiscences of life before wartime, Perec states that the letter he believed to have identified correctly in fact "looks nothing like the sign" he drew on the page, a trace which resembles no existing Hebrew character unless one mistake it for a poorly drawn "mem" (<i>W</i>, 14). Far from the sacred, living language of the Book that would form the basis of a daily interaction with tradition, Hebrew is marked by the author as a space of alterity and uncertainty, consigned to an irretrievable past.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The alphabetical phantasm recounted in <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i> is all the more poignant when one considers that the foreign languages to which Perec was exposed as a child in Belleville, where eighty per cent of foreign-born Jews spoke Yiddish in everyday dealings (<i>TJF</i>, 151), he was thereafter forced to repress in what David Bellos calls "a vitally necessary act of forgetting" (<i>GP</i>, 68). To "forget" one's Jewishness was of course to transgress the most basic tenet of Jewish law (<i>Deut.</i> VIII). Yet not to do so under Nazi occupation was to expose oneself to persecution and, after 1941, to arrest and deportation. Placed by his mother on a Red Cross train evacuating children from Paris to the so-called <i>zone libre</i> ("free zone") in autumn 1941 (<i>W</i>, 54&#x2013;56), Perec spent the remainder of the conflict and the immediate postwar in a private Catholic school in Villard-de-Lans, an Alpine resort town where members of his extended family had congregated. In 1943, he was baptized Catholic at the insistence of his tutor, thought by his aunt to be a converted Jew (<i>W</i>, 94). The biting remarks Perec makes in <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i> about his "frustrated left-handedness" (<i>W</i>, 134&#x2013;36) should perhaps be read in relation to this all but forced christening, the one memory acting as a "screen," in Freud's sense, for the other.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  After the war, Perec was entrusted to his aunt Esther and her non-religious husband, David Bienenfeld, who worked in the pearl trade; he thus came of age in a highly assimilated bourgeois household of western Paris that was in many ways the opposite of the religious environment he had known before the war in the working-class immigrant enclave of Belleville. </p>

<p>At this point in his personal history, as Marcel B&#x00E9;nabou has noted, Perec could well have taken a militant stance with respect to his Jewishness; "he could have become the very archetype of the rebellious victim, of the Jew who tirelessly denounces the scandal of hatred and persecution and tries constantly to draw lessons from it."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  But so immeasurable were the events of the 1940s&#x2014;expressed in <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i>'s painfully telegraphic style by just two words: "the war, the camps" (<i>W</i>, 6)&#x2014;that the writer, like many other Jewish intellectuals of his age group, long shrouded his Jewishness in silence, as if to protect himself from reopening a wound that had not yet begun to heal.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, commenting on Claudine Vegh's compilation of narratives told by the children of deportees, expresses this collective muteness with particular eloquence: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The terrible silence of children who are coerced to endure more than they can bear! The mute agonies they suffer when they are forced to bury deep in their souls an injury, an anguish that never leaves them, a grief so severe that it defies expression! And this not just when the destructive event happened, or during its immediate aftermath, not only in childhood, when we find it difficult to put into words, to open up about what concerns us most intensely, about which we feel most deeply, but for years on end.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p class="continued">Having introjected an unspeakable loss that refuses representation, and hence could not be mourned&#x2014;his mother's sole tomb, indeed, would be a written memorial composed of the names of deportees<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> &#x2014;, Perec was never to "open up" about his Jewishness, preferring a blank, dispassionate style without style to the language of sentiment and suffering. In <i>R&#x00E9;cits d'Ellis Island</i>, the plight of millions of European immigrants who fled poverty and persecution for the new world and who spent a few hours or a few days in the triage center known as the "Isle of Tears," prompts the speaker, whose own family had dispersed to France, North America, Britain, Argentina, and Palestine, to assess the terms of his own fragile identity: </p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Behind this characteristic "uneasiness" and "deficiency" felt by the outsider unconnected to tradition, Perec remained acutely aware that the conditions of possibility for writing lay in the historical fact of his family's judaity. As he expresses it in conclusion to a laconic double-portrait of his father and mother in <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i>, the violence of History has placed on him a debt that he can never erase, but only remember, rehearse, and repeat: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I don't know whether I have anything to say. I know that I am saying nothing. I don't know if what I might have to say is unsaid because it is unsayable (the unsayable is not buried inside writing, it is what prompted it in the first place); I know that what I am saying is colorless, is neutral, is a sign, once and for all, of a once-and-for-all annihilation.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">These assertions, full of "nots" and "anythings," are the closest Perec ever comes to the negativity of a Beckett or a Blanchot. But in the end these statements are but a prelude to the solemn recognition that the project of writing points beyond the unrepresentable moment of annihilation which instigates it, to a shared presence that remains vital despite its temporal remove. The dysphoria of History is contrasted to the belief that all writing is testimony, a proof of continuity in the face of shattered destinies: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I write: I write because we lived together, because I was one amongst them, a shadow among their shadows, a body close to their bodies, I write because they left in me their indelible mark, whose trace is writing.

<p class="continued">
The relationship posed here between death and memory is suggestive not simply of the interminable work of mourning proper to all representation but also of deep links to what is arguably the paramount culture of memory: Judaism itself. As Yosef H. Yerushalmi recounts, in the Talmud it is written that the unborn child "knows the entirety of the Torah and can perceive the world from one extremity to another. But just as he is about to be born, an angel comes who closes his mouth [&#x2026;] and suddenly the newborn forgets everything. He must&#x2014;alas&#x2014;relearn the Torah."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  For Perec, to write as a Jew whose ideals remain secular is to re-member that which has been dis-membered (a family tree, its branches severed and offered up in holocaust), to relearn that which has been unlearnt (the certainty that before all ties were broken to father and mother, there existed a place and time of togetherness). Split in time between remembered and remembering selves, between the object of reminiscence and its agent, the writing subject embraces the impossible task of retrieving in language what is lost to the world: "I have no alternative but to conjure up what for too many years I called the irrevocable: the things that were, the things that stopped, the things that were closed off&#x2014;things that surely were and today are no longer, but things that also were so that I may still be" (<i>W</i>, 12&#x2013;13). It is this very "irrevocability" of the past that by calling forth ritualized forms of memory pushes Perec to affirm his judaity not as a faith, but as a principle that can be summed up in a single word: <i>Zakhor</i>! </p>

<p>"I have no childhood memories," Perec long said to himself, no doubt fearful, as a war orphan, of the high psychic and social costs the work of reminiscence would entail (<i>W</i>, 6). By the end of the 1960s, however, the author had gained the awareness that were he to continue repeating this claim, his "amnesia" risked becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. The oblique response to the Hebraic injunction to remembrance adopted by Perec would be that of committing to paper, in well-nigh manic fashion, any and all traces of places, things, and persons past and present, so many documents attesting that something, somewhere, had escaped destruction. Amnesia calls forth its opposite: a self-induced hypermnesia which takes the form of an obsessive cataloguing and description of the most ordinary elements of life. Texts like "Notes Concerning the Objects that are on my Work-table" or "Attempt at an Inventory of the Liquid and Solid Foodstuffs Ingurgitated by Me in the Course of the Year Nineteen Hundred and Seventy-Four," both of 1976, point to the fragility of the present and the need to retain some proof of its concreteness, however derisory (<i>SSOP</i>, 140&#x2013;43; 240&#x2013;45). If these circumstantial pieces recall above all the melancholic irreverence of conceptual art "after the end of art," to borrow Arthur C. Danto's phrase, other projects undertaken by Perec from the late 1960s onward can be read in a Jewish modernist perspective inasmuch as they ritualize anamnesis through innovative formal conceits. Such is the case, for example, of <i>L'Arbre</i>, the story of several branches of Perec's family tree as told to the writer by his aunt Esther; such is also the case of the neo-Proustian <i>Lieux o&#x00F9; j'ai dormi</i>, described as "an inventory, as exhaustive and as accurate as possible, of all the 'Places Where I Have Slept'" and all the memories the mental image of each place&#x2014;bedrooms, dormitories, barracks, guests rooms, hotel rooms, sleeping cars, and so on&#x2014;can resurrect from the writer's past (<i>SSOP</i>, 22&#x2013;23); such too is the case 

<b></b>

 of <i>Je me souviens</i>, a compilation of four hundred fifty-nine "micromemories," each prefaced by the formula "Je me souviens&#x2026;" (I remember&#x2026;) and containing the names of performers, athletes, and public personalities, advertising jingles, slogans, and sundry trivia from the France of the 1950s.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  But it is <i>Lieux</i> (<i>Places</i>), one of his more ambitious projects and one of many which, like <i>L'Arbre</i> or <i>Lieux o&#x00F9; j'ai dormi</i> themselves, had failed to materialize in a book when Perec died in 1982, that perhaps most compellingly recalls the Jewish work of memory, via Freud's comparison of the human psyche to an "archive" of traces. </p>

<p><i>Lieux</i> began in the late 1960s as an exercise in ethnographic observation that Perec hoped to undertake in tandem with anthropologist Georges Condominas, the author of a landmark 1959 monograph on the semi-nomadic Mnong-Gar people of the Vietnamese high plateau.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The two collaborators' intent was to describe, over a number of years, a fixed number of places in the city of Paris&#x2014;streets, street corners, squares&#x2014;at regular intervals.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  On each visit, Perec would transcribe, after the manner of an anthropologist taking notes in the field, the occurrences and objects that characterize the place in its everydayness, while Condominas would create a photographic record to which his partner's written documentation could be compared. After each of the selected sites had been observed once, completing an initial cycle, a new series of descriptions would commence; over time, the cumulative descriptions would reveal the aging of each place. Reminiscent of much photograph-based conceptual art of its time, the project exemplifies Perec's ingenious manner of placing extra-literary models in the service of writing. Indeed, the serial descriptions recall nothing so much as the agricultural practices of Mnong-Gar villagers themselves. As Condominas had discovered in his fieldwork, the Mnong people tightly linked the passing of time to the planting cycle, clearing, sowing, harvesting, and finally burning the land around their village before moving to another arable site within their territory. As each site had been cultivated in previous agricultural cycles, it retained, for the elders members of the village who had taken part in earlier rotations, traces of a collective past. </p>

<p>Just as the Mnong-Gar "ate" through their lands by moving from site to site, then, so too would Perec and Condominas work through their Parisian places by observing one after the other in a series before starting the cycle of descriptions anew. But this curious exercise in reverse or reflexive ethnography was substantially modified before it got off the ground. Condominas opted out of the project, which would have prevented him from leaving Paris for any stretch of time. Left to tend to his Parisian fields on his own, Perec added to the on-site descriptions a second series of written "evocations" of the same set of places. These were to be drawn up from memory, on a site different from the place to be evoked. The specifics of this expanded project, which Perec first shared with his editor in 1969,<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  were explained to readers in the pages of <i>Esp&#x00E8;ces d'espaces</i> (<i>Species of Spaces</i>, 1974) nearly six years after the project was launched. In the chapter of this "journal of a space user" devoted to the city street can be found some "notes on a work in progress": 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In 1969, I chose, in Paris, twelve places (streets, squares, circuses, an arcade), where I had either lived or else was attached to by particular memories.</p>
<p>I have undertaken to write a description of two of these places each month. One of these descriptions is written on the spot and is meant to be as neutral as possible. Sitting in a caf&#x00E9; or walking in the street, notebook and pen in hand, I do my best to describe the houses, the shops and the people that I come across, the posters, and in a general way, all the details that attract my eye. The other description is written somewhere other than the place itself. I then do my best to describe it from memory, to evoke all the memories that come to me concerning it, whether events that have taken place there, or people I have met there.</p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The project's duration was fixed at twelve years, such that at the end of twelve full cycles, two series of one hundred and forty-four texts each would be created. If the first mode of on-site observation is indebted to the descriptive ethnography of Marcel Mauss and the "sociology of everyday life" of Marxist thinker Henri Lefebvre,<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  the second, autobiographical mode, like the aforementioned "Places Where I Slept," recalls Proust's voluntary memory, the work of anamnesis being channeled through privileged <i>lieux de m&#x00E9;moire</i>. </p>

<p>The project as a whole presents interesting parallels to the <i>ars memorativa</i> or <i>memoria</i> of classical antiquity, a branch of rhetoric that fell into disuse with the generalization of print. As Frances A. Yates explains,<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  to memorize a speech for public delivery, classical orators were first instructed to compose a set of memory places or <i>loci memoriae</i> based on the architectural features of a real or imagined room, building, or city street. After breaking down the speech into images that were suggestive either of the things to be communicated (<i>memoria rerum</i>) or of the precise words to be used (<i>memoria verborum</i>), the orator mentally deposited these coded <i>imagenes</i> one by one in the pre-selected <i>loci</i> for safekeeping. When it came time to deliver his speech, he needed only run through his <i>loci</i> in proper sequence in his mind's eye, and each place would deliver its content, recalling to consciousness the things or words encoded in the corresponding image. </p>

<p>Not unlike that of classical rhetoricians, Perec's exercise in artificial memory begins with the selection of twelve distinct and varied memory places (<i>lieux de m&#x00E9;moire</i>). The periodic visits are analogous to the orator's "running through" his <i>loci</i> to prepare his speech. Yet there is a fundamental difference between the two models with respect to function: whereas the classical orator knows what he will find in each <i>locus</i> (the image corresponding to part of his argument), the creator of <i>Lieux</i> is unsure of the precise contents he will unearth when "visiting" his Parisian places; far from empty architectural receptacles, these streets and squares are sites of personal significance that are likely to trigger unsuspected reminiscences. To avoid merely repeating himself from year to year, the creator of <i>Lieux</i> adopts stringent rules and schedules: the permutations of two mutually orthogonal Latin bi-squares ensure that each place will be described in a different month of the year and that never will the same pair of places be described the same month. Each text, moreover, is to be placed in a sealed envelope immediately after its composition. The result of this elaborate scheme is a "time capsule" (<i>bombe du </i>

<b></b>

 <i>temps</i>), to be opened and consulted by its maker only when all two hundred eighty-eight texts are completed. From the rereading and reorganization of the resulting material, the author of <i>Esp&#x00E8;ces d'espaces</i> expects to gain insight into a three-fold process of aging&#x2014;"of the places themselves, of my memories, and of my writing" (<i>SSOP</i>, 56). </p>

<p>The implicit reference to the classical art of memory of Cicero and Quintilian, to the obscure habits of the Mnong-Gar, or to conceptual art of the late 1960s veils another intertext, one that becomes legible only if one considers that among the twelve Parisian places selected is the Rue Vilin, the street where Perec lived as an infant and young child and ostensibly last saw his parents together. By obliging himself to return to this site twice per year, once in person to take stock of the place's physical evolution, and once in spirit to add new memory traces to his private archive, the creator of <i>Lieux</i> enacts what might be seen as an oblique variation on Kaddish, the ritual prayer for the dead spoken each day during the year after the disappearance of a loved one and on each anniversary of his or her death thereafter. Kaddish, in which one implores the consolation of the Holy One, is customarily said only in the presence of a <i>minyan</i> or quorum of ten believers needed for communal prayer. Condemned by circumstance to solitude, cut off from tradition and community, Perec constructs his unorthodox memorial to the departed on his own, attempting to cull from each place traces of his forebears' passage, and knowing all the while that no moment of Proustian plenitude&#x2014;no revelation, no closure&#x2014;is likely forthcoming. </p>

<p>As is the case with any ritual (and how not to think here of that of the psychoanalytical cure itself), <i>Lieux</i> places upon its inventor constraints that may become difficult to bear. When on-site, for instance, Perec forbids himself to write up his reminiscences, performing neutral, punctilious descriptions of what is strictly visible; conversely, in the parallel memory series, when he attempts to recall significant details about the past, he deprives himself of the material aid of what Maurice Halbwachs calls the "spatial framework of memory,"<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  namely the city street or square itself. These constraints seem to work at cross-purposes. In its fragmentary search for an ideal totality in which remembering and remembered selves would coincide, the project weighs itself down with uncertainty: What if the self-imposed revisiting of memories led only to sterile repetition, rather than to a transformative "working through" in Freud's sense (<i>Durcharbeitung</i>) capable of rearranging "memory traces," of bringing to light repressed contents that long remained inaccessible in the far reaches of consciousness? </p>

<p>Whether due to the weariness of its creator or, as Philippe Lejeune suggests, because of the successful outcome of an analysis undertaken with J.B. Pontalis that coincided with the completion of <i>W ou le souvenir d'enfance</i>&#x2014;itself informed by the memory exercises of <i>Lieux</i>&#x2014;, the twelve-year project ground to a halt in 1975, when only one hundred thirty-three of the projected two hundred eighty-eight texts had been completed.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  This failure remains relative, for if Perec's "time bomb" was never fully assembled according to program, it nonetheless gave rise to a series of published texts. Significantly, while Perec chose to keep for himself all twelve series of evocations, between 1977 and 1980 he published roughly one-half of the six-and-a-half years' worth of on-site descriptions as part of the offshoot project entitled "Attempt to Describe Some 

<b></b>

 Parisian Places." These texts, in keeping with Perec's <i>parti pris</i> of neutral description, refuse the trappings of literary prose, enumerating in laconic fashion the passage of pedestrians and vehicles viewed from a corner caf&#x00E9;, or the nature and condition of the buildings and storefronts lining both sides of a street. Presented chronologically as an independent series, several years' worth of descriptions express the fundamentals of change and continuity that make up the fabric of everyday life. The following passage, from "La rue Vilin," corresponds to Perec's first visit to the site in 1969: </p>

<p class="continued">Halting in front of No 24 in the same street, Perec identifies the building as "the house where I lived," its doorway still bearing "traces of paintwork and above, not yet completely rubbed away, the inscription LADIES' HAIRDRESSER." Aside from two or three details, he maintains the dispassionate stance of the ethnographic observer in accordance with his self-imposed rule of describing each place "in a manner as neutral as possible." On subsequent visits, his field notes become more and more stenographic&#x2014;not least because, the city of Paris having slated the Rue Vilin for renovation (it is to become a public park), there is less and less of which to take note. Storefronts are boarded up, rows of houses taken down and replaced by vacant lots. In 1974, just five years after the project was launched, fewer than half of the buildings in the Rue Vilin are left standing:  </p>

<p class="continued">Traces of the past fade in the light of day, like the inscription "COIFFURE DAMES" marking the modest hair salon run by Perec's mother before the war, or the name of a Jewish tailor, Selibter. With time, all these crumbling edifices will fall victim to the onslaught of bulldozers and wrecking-balls, so many would-be harbingers of civic renewal. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The reader of the time-lapse stenography of "La rue Vilin" is confronted with more than the ineluctable passing of the years: the texts bear witness to the systematic destruction of a personal and collective site of memory, this once vibrant Jewish district that Perec would have liked to call home: "I would like there to exist places that are stable, unmoving, intangible, untouched and almost untouchable, unchanging, deep-rooted; places that might be points of reference, of departure, of origin" (<i>SSOP</i>, 90). Yet space is, for the subject in search of origins, forever marked by doubt, such that the only space of certainty is that of the written page itself. Returning to the Rue Vilin for his annual visit of 1975, Perec, who had on previous occasions filled page after page with his notations, jots down just two lines: "Almost the whole of the odd-numbered side has been covered with cement fences. On one of them is a graffito: WORK = TORTURE" (<i>SSOP</i>, 217). It is surely not for nothing that Perec put an end to his project shortly after transcribing these premonitory words: the writing, apparently, is on the wall. Anamnesis has lost its reason for being as its material foothold disappears from the city fabric. When the messianic, redemptive qualities of memory&#x2014;those cherished by Walter Benjamin or Gershom Scholem&#x2014;have been suppressed by History, all that remains are lists, so many solemn litanies attesting to the absence of those who once walked these streets and to the silent indifference of the world. </p>

<p>"The decline of Jewish collective memory in modern times is only a symptom of the unraveling of that common network of belief and praxis through whose mechanisms [&#x2026;] the past was once made present. Therein lies the root of the malady. Ultimately Jewish memory cannot be 'healed' unless the group itself finds healing, unless its wholeness is restored or rejuvenated," writes Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  If, as the author of <i>Zakhor</i> suggests, Jewish memory is Jewish only to the extent that it speaks to the experience of the group as marked by tradition, what can be said of the memory of those largely secular European Jews like Perec, who in the postwar found themselves separated from family, home, and religious collectivity, deprived of those "mechanisms" that for preceding generations ensured that the past could be made present, replaced in a narrative continuum? To be sure, for a significant sector of French Jewry, healing was be found in a return to the Torah and Talmud, spurred by the arrival in the late 1950s and 1960s of religious North African Jews who fled intolerance and arabization. To the extent that many of these Sephardic communities remained close-knit and highly observant (and indeed chose to reinvest the very same urban districts inhabited two decades earlier by eastern European Jews),<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  rediscovery of Jewish custom&#x2014;again adapted to the social norms of a newly modernized France&#x2014;became possible for the descendents of Ashkenazic Jews as well, many of whom had suppressed all interest in their heritage. Later still, after much hesitation, some measure of healing would be found in the commemoration of the Shoah itself. As untiring historians, lawyers, and activists began to correct the skewed Gaullist vision of the French past and to break the official silence on the state's role in the fate of French Jews, the troubled legacy 

<b></b>

 of the war years returned to the fore of national consciousness. The very catastrophe that had all but destroyed shared tradition was, for the families of victims, to elicit a revival of collective memory, now rewritten in the form of a prayer to the dead and, over time, a celebration of the witness whose duty it was to preserve and disseminate the no longer "unspeakable" truth of deportation and genocide. </p>

<p>In the case of non-religious Jewish writers like Perec, whom the upheavals of the war had reduced to a traumatic silence, neither of these assertive courses of action that could have led to belated self-identification as a Jew&#x2014;religious revival or communitarian militancy&#x2014;were possible. Nor were they necessary from the point of view of the writer, for whom every mark of the pen, every typewriter stroke spoke to an uneasiness and homelessness that arose from an originary moment of annihilation. It is this negative content at the heart of his writing project that firmly ties Perec to a modernist aesthetic of lack, one in which the poetic impulse and indeed literary representation itself compensate for a missing or lost object. Even as texts such as <i>W or the Memory of Childhood</i> or the fragments of <i>Places</i> point towards post-modern zones of uncertainty, dispersion, and well-nigh parodic incompleteness, the modernist hope of restoring a memory in its plenitude by poetic means and of giving rise to a narrative of generational continuity remains at the horizon of Perec's writing. Nostalgia and a melancholy seriousness color each failed attempt to mend the broken threads of memory by this author whose wild hope it was "to write all that it's possible for a man of today to write" (<i>SSOP,</i> 138). </p>

<p>While other prominent Jewish writers and intellectuals of Perec's generation writing in French, like Jacques Derrida or Edmond Jab&#x00E8;s, share to an extent his homelessness and even, in the first case, a similarly "dubious" sense of belonging to Jewish tradition, most came from Sephardic milieus that had been spared, for geographical reasons, the brunt of the war. Caught between multiple languages and cultures, these more properly nomadic subjects turned their historical situation to their advantage, exalting uprootedness as a critical wellspring and indeed finding in Judaism's forms and teachings rich discursive models. For Perec, Jewishness was, in Marcel B&#x00E9;nabou's words, "reduced to almost nothing,"<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  and it is this deceptively productive "nothing" that allows us to situate, however precariously, his exhaustive poetics of anamnesis on the near side of the modernist/post-modernist divide. </p>

<p id="lead">Sometime around 1877, while beginning work on what would become the opera <i>Parsifal</i>, Richard Wagner was sent an anonymous pamphlet attributed to a "significant Jewish voice." The pamphlet prophesied the inevitable victory of "the modern world" over the old, "orthodox" one, in spite of the power and elegant rhetoric of conservative forces: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Modern journalism and Romanticism have utterly conquered the freethinking Jewish and Christian worlds. I include the freethinking Jewish world &#x2013; for in fact German Jewry is working so forcefully, so colossally, and so tirelessly on the new culture and science that, consciously or unconsciously, the majority of Christendom is being led by Jews.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Wagner could not agree more ("How true!"), and quoted the pamphlet at the opening of his vociferous and explicitly antisemitic attack on "the new culture" (not yet called "modernism").<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  His salty attack itself had the concise and apt title "Modern," and in it he reiterated and condensed opinions he had long expressed: "Modern" was fleeting and arbitrary, moved by whimsy rather than deep necessity, linked to "<i>Mode</i>" (fashion), to the base manifestations of the new materialist civilization, to France and to the Jews&#x2014;and hence foreign both to the German spirit and to art itself.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Wagner's radical artistic program rejected the modern present even as it shared modern culture's rejection of traditionalism&#x2014;but instead of "the modern," Wagner spoke of revolution and the future.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It is not my intention to rehash the debates among latter-day Wagnerites and their detractors concerning the degree and importance 

<b></b>

 of the composer's antisemitism and its relationship to his art. Still, the most extreme of these defenses&#x2014;arguing either that Wagner's statements on Jews and culture were not particularly hateful, or were simply consistent with ideas current when he was writing&#x2014;miss the centrality of the re of the Jew in the edifice of Wagner's rhetoric on the art of the future.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Whatever he might have felt about real, existing Jews (his antipathy toward his rival Meyerbeer notwithstanding), the absence and/or presence of "Jews" is key to the structure of Wagner's arguments about the value of this or the other art, and the historical trajectory of art.  </p>

<p>I want to suggest that it is not for nothing that this early formulation of antisemitic antimodernism agrees so readily with its concurrent philosemitic modernist triumphalist counterpart. Both depend on a story of emancipation-assimilation-integration where presence immediately becomes omnipresence, and participation becomes hegemony (of a surreptitious kind), leading to the emergence of modernism. But this emergence is not as linear as it sounds. To return to the passage quoted above, the Jews are won over to or "conquered" by the modern, the triumph of which constitutes the illicit conquest of the German Christian population by the Jews. A bracketed phrase betrays that this conquest is especially nefarious because the vanquished are not even aware it has happened; neither, it seems, are the victors. To demonstrate this invisible truth, the writer points out that hardly a newspaper or other publication is produced in Germany that is not "directly or indirectly" in Jewish hands. The philosemitic and pro-modernist argument is in this case (as in others) dependent on the twin premises that modernism is Jewish, and yet that modernism's Jewishness is somehow hidden and needs to be revealed. A recurring strategy for making this invisible Jewishness visible again concerns what seems to be a dialectic of Jewish presence/absence, by posing a counter-factual or counter-historical hypothesis: suppose Jews were absent from modern culture? How would it look then? Wagner pursues this precise tactic. In "Judaism in Music" he had already made a claim both for the total "jewification" of modern art (employing the unlikely and repugnant term "<i>Verj&#x00FC;dung</i>" that the Nazis would make familiar a three-quarter century later), and that "the Jews have not produced a single true poet."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Without Jews, the modern culture industry, as Wagner understood it in his own time, would vanish, or transform itself completely; art, on the other hand, would be unaffected. So in this incipient instance of modern German cultural antisemitism&#x2014;an only half racialist Jew-baiting with one foot in the illustrious past, one in the formidable future of Christian German Jew-hatred&#x2014;and in this attack on Franco-Jewish modernism <i>avant la lettre</i>, a rhetorical strategy emerges that will come into its own after Wagner's death. This rhetoric poses the questions: You want to know how the Jews have spoiled the modern world? What's Jewish about <i>die Moderne</i>?<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  What's wrong with the Jewish Modern? And responds: Take them away and you'll see! </p>

<p>There are reasons for me to begin my contribution to a special issue looking back at "Jewish modernism" with this reminder of the moment where Wagner anticipated it; of course, as I pointed out above, in his own view he was diagnosing the present, and dreaming of a different future. The object to be traced here is specific to German-speaking central Europe, and it is a re that has been particularly powerful 

<b></b>

 there, although significant aspects of the re will be more broadly familiar. I call this <i>j&#x00FC;dische Moderne</i> or Jewish Modern a re and expressly avoid discussing it as a catalogue of authors or works. To think of "Jewish modernism" in a topical way, as though there were a specific corpus or prescriptive formal definition captured by the term, seems futile at best (if not ominous). There can be no literary history of Jewish modernism. Perhaps, though, there is a history to be told about a discourse on Jewish modernism in German-speaking central Europe. Even that discourse is not singular, prescriptive, or consistent, but may perhaps better be characterized by its operation than by its contents. If this is the case, then our question cannot be what is or was Jewish modernism, but what work does and did the re "Jewish modernism" do for its users. This is not to warn contributors and readers of this special issue that to invoke this re is to play with fire, but rather to consider ways in which one might "think with" Jewish modernism, engage it on the multiple levels on which it has functioned, without being swept in its tide. If, as in the Wagnerian example, Jewish modernism is a complex field of self-contradictory tensions and inversions, its story cannot simply be narrated, but can perhaps best be captured by representing a constellation of moments in its elastic life.  </p>

<p>"Modernism Without Jews" borrows from another title familiar to German and Jewish studies readers. Hugo Bettauer's 1922 novel and the generally faithful 1924 Hans Karl Breslauer film adaptation were both called <i>Die Stadt ohne Juden</i> ("The City Without Jews.") <sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Bettauer was born to a Jewish family as Maximilian Hugo Bettauer, but was a convert and a Protestant, although his real faith was in progressive secular rationalism; he was a publicist, journalist, and writer of a score of rapidly published popular novels, the best-selling of which was to be <i>The City Without Jews</i>. His writing, in other words, was a prime example of the burgeoning popular culture industry in the era of the Weimar Republic. Bettauer's easy-reading tale is set in the not-so-distant future (its subtitle in German is "a novel from the day after tomorrow"), and it is clearly a light-hearted satire rather than the warning-toll of catastrophe that it has been made out to be. <i>TheCity Without Jews </i>bases itself on the premise, meant to be somewhat absurd, that in a time of financial and cultural crisis not unlike the mid-1920s, the parliament of Austria passes a measure expelling the country's Jews. A unifying melodrama involving the separation of the young Jewish hero Leo Strakosch from his gentile beloved and his maneuvers to reverse the order ties together a series of scenes displaying the cultural anarchy the absence of Jews in Vienna unleashes: we witness the anarchic collapse of the stock market and of consumer culture, among other hallmarks of modern life. Strakosch, meanwhile, moving through Vienna in disguise as the bearded Frenchman Henry Dufresne, puts out a series of pamphlets calling for the reversal of the expulsion and signed by the "League of Truthful Christians," leading to a parliamentary vote on repeal, which he ingeniously rigs, and the Jews are welcomed back into the city. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>There are several ways in which we may see Wagner's text and Bettauer's (and Breslauer's film even more starkly) as bookends of "German-Jewish modernism." Once again, this term cannot refer to a particular kind of modern culture that is Jewish, but rather a complex discourse linking an origin of authorship to 'the modern' in a network of self-contradictory but compelling ways. These bookends reflect one another in an apparently inverted way&#x2014;but inversion seems to be integral to the discourse I am describing. Just as Wagner was able to introduce the essay "Modern" with a (presumed) philosemitic text understood to be by a Jew, Bettauer/Breslauer's enlightened texts conjure the utopian fantasy of Jewish absence in order to refute antisemitism. As with all inversions, elements remain intact and often enough identical in both versions: today's viewers of Breslauer's film will be struck by the persistence of horrific antisemitic stereotypical caricatures throughout, which is the case in the book as well; a simple analysis of character types in the film shows that the rudest portrayals and greatest number of such portrayals are of Jews, while the pan-German antisemites and others are represented at worst as a bit dim. Granted, the young Jew Strakosch is a romantic hero, but one who vanquishes the antisemites at the price of proving their central theses: there is a Jewish conspiracy, and modernity is in the hands of the Jews. He slips back into Austria in disguise, passing as a Christian. Another inverted twin of this film, Hippler's Nazi propaganda feature <i>The Eternal Jew</i> , employs passing as a primary trope in persuading the audience of the invisible, infiltrating, alien presence. A famous dissolve sequence, from the faces of a group of bearded Polish Jewish men in kaftans to the same men groomed as "Westerners," dissolving then to a cocktail party of cultivated Berlin Jews, gives visual form to the conflicting notions of Jewish passing and essential difference, ineradicable separateness and total infiltration and saturation.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In <i>The City Without Jews</i>, Leo Strakosch reveals himself in a scene that inverts Hippler's dissolve. At the moment the ban on Jews is lifted, he tells the story of how he has been responsible for this happy turn of events, all the while clipping and shaving the beard of his Christian-French alter-ego and revealing himself to be the "handsome, smooth-faced" young hero.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Of course, one could protest, the inversion is meant to reverse the meaning of the antisemitic narrative, but this example shows how in spite of these admitted intentions, the inversion "proves the rule": the Jew has passed and has infiltrated, he has used the sham popular mechanisms of democracy to further his own ends, and he has done so through deception and dissimulation&#x2014;and his primary personal motive, after all, is the desire for an "Aryan" woman.  </p>

<p><i>The City Without Jews</i> seems not to be able to help but compulsively name and confirm every tenet of anti-modernist antisemitism. An interesting case of this involves the propaganda surrounding the film's distribution, where great efforts were made to mark the film as a vehicle of enlightened anti-antisemitism that was coming from rational German Christians. Bettauer's and the film's antisemitic opponents naturally aimed first to expose the fact that this was really a propaganda piece generated by a Jewish culture industry, and they did not have to scratch the surface of the production very hard to find more than a few participants who were Jewish according to their own criteria (not least, of course, Bettauer himself). Interestingly, though, this drama is inscribed 

<b></b>

 in the book and film themselves, with the question of pseudepigraphy embodied in the propaganda leaflets "signed" by the non-existent organization "League of Truthful Christians," which the audience/readers know is neither a league, nor truthful, nor Christian, but the fabrication of a single, lying Jew.  </p>

<p>Even more than with other works, today one cannot write about <i>The City Without Jews</i> without placing it within a dense historical context that foregrounds its afterlife, and confounds where else it might be placed in relation to its own past, present, and future. Its eccentric fantasy of the elimination of Jews from a central European country&#x2014;the absurdity of the thesis in its time is impossible for us to reproduce&#x2014;must seem to every contemporary reader/viewer a shockingly frank prophesy of the Nazi final solution, rather than an "amusing" satire of the Austrian Christian Social past and contemporary pan-German antisemitic rhetoric.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Within two years of the release of the film, Hugo Bettauer was to be murdered in his own office by a fanatic with Nazi ties, making the link of the 1922 text and its author to the Nazi violence of the future impossible for latter-day readers to disaggregate. Recall, too, that Bettauer's subtitle was "a novel from the day after tomorrow," although the English translation of a few years later changed the subtitle to "a novel of our times." For the American public of 1926, the author of satirical future fantasy has become "first and last a realist, an accurate and astute observer."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The film's "rediscovery" and reconstruction in 1991 was the object of an extremely heavy investment of effort led by the Filmarchiv Austria and leading to the publication of a 487-page documentation volume accompanying the release of the digitally restored and reconstructed film, making this relatively minor production among the most documented German-language films from the interwar period, the powerful scholarly interest in Weimar film history notwithstanding.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>

<p>While the "discovery" of the film has produced a flurry of culture studies interest in the early twenty-first century, the example of Hugo Bettauer has long been seen to offer a dense case study of the complex of Jewishness/Jewish self-hatred/antisemitism in relation to modernism/modernization/modernity. "The Bettauer Case" was in fact the title of one scholar's attempt at synthesizing Hugo Bettauer's biography, historical contexts, and literary texts. Ironically but significantly, a lead article of the same title graced the front pages of the antisemitic bi-weekly <i>Der Weltkampf</i> (<i>World struggle</i>) by the journal's editor, no less an ideologue of the Nazi movement than Alfred Rosenberg.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The propagandist and the scholar share more than a title, though. They both find Bettauer of interest as a symptom of his time (just as retrospective observers would call the <i>City Without Jews</i> a <i>Zeitdokument</i> or documentation of its time)<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> . Bettauer was not only a prolific writer of popular fiction, he was also a tireless publicist for sexual enlightenment, and editor of a publication designed to popularize freethinking and open discussion of issues regarding sexuality entitled <i>Him and Her</i>.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  He was an outspoken campaigner for the decriminalization of homosexuality, and pushed the envelope of censors by testing the boundaries of permissible publication of erotica. All this led to a widely publicized indecency case, itself a product of the cultural politics of the Austrian battle between progressive socialists and antisemitic Christian Socials. Bettauer's assassination by a right-wing dental student in 1925 was clearly a result of 

<b></b>

 this sort of sensation, but the trial of the murderer became no less a sensation; like so many fanatic right-wing murderers of Weimar Germany, Otto Rothstock got off with a remarkably light sentence, hailed by many on the right as a moral hero. "The Bettauer Case" hence refers to an immensely ramified exemplar that includes these two sensational court cases, played out in public with richly overdetermined meanings. The articulation and interpretation of these strands of meaning is an objective shared to a remarkable extent by the two "Bettauer case" texts, one Nazi and one German studies. Both concern themselves with the network of "new" mass culture texts, including pulp novellas, popular sex education, erotica, scandal, and sensation. For both critics, this was a modernity infused and obsessed with Jewishness. </p>

<p>The epigraph to the Filmarchiv Austria documentation volume is a one-page condensation of a 1956 article by Harry Zohn, called "The City Without Jews," recalling Bettauer's "strangely prophetic book from the year 1922, a sort of inverted utopia describing Vienna without Jews and the subsequent collapse of the economic and cultural life of the city." Zohn goes on to ruminate on present-day  Vienna, the relatively peripheral if not fully non-existent Jewish population of the city, and attribution of the "provincialism of daily life, the brutalization of taste, the reduction of cosmopolitanism of the city" to the decimation of its Jewish population.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Steven Beller's 1989 <i>Vienna and the Jews</i>, a chief history of the Jewish cultural presence in Vienna in the period of high modernism, cites the same source, using the same strategy: also deploying the term "prophetic" to describe the 1924 novel, he summarizes Bettauer's fantasy of a city stripped of contemporary popular culture (but not the opera), essentially stagnant and uneventful, and determines that, "for anyone who has been to Vienna in the 1980s, there are remarkable similarities between what Bettauer foresaw and what the present city is like..."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Bettauer is an apt introduction to Beller's book, certainly, since it is no exaggeration to reduce Beller's thesis to the crudest reading of <i>The City Without Jews</i>: Viennese modernism was/is Jewish, whether it was/is visible or not (and mostly, it seems, it was). The awkward similarity of this central thesis to the central thesis of the modernists' contemporary antisemitic critics is not lost on Beller, but he does nothing to suggest what we are to do with this similarity, or to account for the recurrence of this pattern in any way.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The resemblance has been taken more seriously by other readers. Sir Ernst Gombrich, invited by the Austrian Cultural Institute to contribute to a 1996 seminar on "Fin De Si&#x00E8;cle Vienna and its Jewish Cultural Influences," took the occasion to resist the given topic, "the Jewish influences [sic] on the visual arts."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Focusing particularly on Beller's thesis on the Jewish character of "Vienna 1900," Gombrich expressed his objection as succinctly as possible: "I am of the opinion that the notion of Jewish Culture was, and is, an invention of Hitler and his fore-runners and after-runners."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Among these fore- and after-runners, Gombrich seems to have counted his fellow Vienna Jews Stefan Zweig (who calculated nine-tenths of nineteenth-century Viennese culture to 

<b></b>

 have been the property of Jews) and George Steiner (who attributed "most of the innovations" of the twentieth century to Viennese of Jewish extraction). Gombrich is baffled by such claims, and finds himself at a point in his own lecture where, to refute the apparently insuperable non-logic of (Austro-)Jewish modernism, he disavows it by tracing his own intellectual genealogy&#x2014;naming the fathers of the Vienna School of art history, including Wickhoff, Riegl, Dvorak, and von Schlosser&#x2014;and certifying that none of these were Jewish. Beyond the macabre resemblance of this method to the Nazi requirement of producing baptismal certificates of four grandparents, this moment in Gombrich's very sound lecture also frankly adopts the despicable practice of "racial" identification and cultural attribution that he condemns. Unlike those he critiques, though, Gombrich is acutely aware of the processes of adoption and inversion mentioned above, and that these inversions prove the rule of antisemitic antimodernism, rather than performing a reversal. In his own, pithier phrase, "even if you turn a myth on its head, you do not get the truth." </p>

<p>The perspicacious Viennese cultural critic Hermann Bahr (allow me to abstain from identifying him as a Jew or a non-Jew)&#x2014;early diagnostician if not founder of such latter-day historiographical principles as "Secession," "fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle," and "modernism," actually&#x2014;could not resist this observation in his portrait of Vienna: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The real Jew has no power in the city of Vienna. Unfortunately. It could use some of his diligence, his industriousness, his earnestness. But the city has always defended itself against him. It doesn't want the competence, greatness, and strength of Jewry. But the Jew who doesn't want to be one, who betrays his race by leaving it, the one who plays something he is not, he is Vienna's kin. The artificiality of these fugitive beings who, emptied of all past, crave to cloak themselves in any present and any future, who are no more than shells of men ready to spout off something different every day, who are capable of being nothing but appearing anything&#x2014;these have always allured the Viennese. He finds himself in such people. If we take the term in this way, it can be said that Vienna is jewified [<i>verjudet</i>] through and through. It was so before the first Jew arrived.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>It seems that to be the first both to identify literary modernism as a critical category and to designate turn-of-the-century Vienna as the modernist cultural capital par excellence, Bahr could not but invoke Jewish modernism. Here the myth is turned not so much on its head as inside-out: Vienna is a city so jewified that its Jewishness preceded the Jews, just as a latent Vienna Modern anticipated modernity.  </p>

<p>"Jewish modernism" is clearly a potent historical re that calls for study, and at the same time it seems to have been immensely difficult to employ any variant of this re without reproducing, more than analyzing, the problem complex to which it refers. The point here is not simply a methodological one (e.g., how to find a way of studying the discourse of Jewish modernism without merely reproducing it). What kind of problem is "Jewish modernism"? 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>In German, the term "Jewish modernism" coincides not only with "Jewish modernity," but also with "modern Judaism." "Die Moderne" had a special ring at the turn of the century, referring at once to a new age and an avant-garde art; "Die j&#x00FC;dische Moderne" was the title of an important lecture given by early Zionist Nathan Birnbaum in Vienna and published in 1896.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Birnbaum seems to have been the one to have coined the term "Zionism" a decade before this lecture, but by the turn of the century his place in the movement was all but utterly eclipsed by the hero of political Zionism, Theodor Herzl. Birnbaum, at much the same time as Herzl, began to dream of a Jewish state in Palestine in light of what he saw as the failed project of assimilation. But Birnbaum stood among those "cultural Zionists" who emphasized the spiritual renewal of Judaism through the Zionist venture, their internal rejection of the abject state of assimilated Jewishness, and consciousness-raising among Jews in the Diaspora. The term "Jewish modern" in his essay plays two apparently contrary functions. It is used as a disdainful term for assimilationist Jews who consider themselves forward-thinking ("modern"), but it also stands for Judaism at a moment of reorientation; the plea of the essay is for the Jewish modern to appreciate that what is needed is an independent national existence. <sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Birnbaum's re of "die j&#x00FC;dische Moderne," not unlike other aspects of his thought, ultimately proved too confusing&#x2014;too complex, ambivalent, or even self-contradictory&#x2014;for his contemporary audience.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  "Jewish modernism" was hence overtaken by the term "Jewish Renaissance," which was favored by other cultural Zionists in the same period, particularly Martin Buber and Ahad Ha'am.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  While the linkage between Renaissance and modernity is not unfamiliar, the former re unambiguously emphasized a return to Jewish spiritual roots. "The modern," as Birnbaum himself suggested in one way the term is used in his own essay, seemed to imply a rejection of the past, of tradition, or of history. As Wagner's essay of that title already showed, the root "modern" was weighed down by its own baggage in the German and German-Jewish context. But it is precisely that complexity that Birnbaum wanted to capture, and that indeed the term Jewish Renaissance did not wish to dispose of: the relationship between historical consciousness and creative innovation was neither meant to be oppositional, nor simply complementary.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Rather, res of history/tradition/memory/the past and /radical innovation constituted poles of a field of tension, sets of axes within a single apparatus. </p>

<p>It was both the strength and the weakness of the term "j&#x00FC;dische Moderne" that it stood for too many things at once, and the same must be said of our meager translation "Jewish modernism." It would be a mistake to bracket the historical debates around the Jewish Modern as somehow referring to something else than our concerns in this issue, because its intended referent (unlike ours) was internal to Jewish culture. The different meanings of the term, from an aesthetic modernism leaning toward abstraction, commodified mass cultural organs and their products, a condition in the secular world putting pressures on a Jewish community struggling for continuity, and the intrinsic refashioning of that community itself, were all part of a single complex. A recent user of the term, for instance, defines it as "a series of disjointed efforts to renew traditional 

<b></b>

 ideational, social, and textual patterns broken by the uneven encounter with Western culture."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As in both the antisemitic and Jewish uses of the concept so far, this definition establishes a distinction of Jews and Western culture (or else there would be no "encounter"), and also allows one to think about specifically Jewish engagements in terms of the guiding forms of modernism; at the same time, the special investment of these specifically Jewish engagements in orientalism/primitivism/spiritualism, and so on, informed modernism back in turn.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Of course, the antinomies of Jewish modernism were not just inscribed in the sideline voices of Nathan Birnbaum and the creative adherents of a Jewish Renaissance, but mainstream Zionism itself emerged in this very context, and nourished it as well.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Not only Birnbaum's "j&#x00FC;dische Moderne," but Herzl's <i>Altneuland</i> ("Old-New Land") was infused with all of the principle features of the texts discussed above: the paradoxes of tradition and innovation, the destiny of essential character and the promise of a radical break from it, discomfort with a present "modernity" above all. This is not to repeat the thesis that Zionist and certain contemporary antisemitic discourses shared a certain lexicon with their common antiliberalism, cult of youth, and so on.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  All of the manifold (including the now forgotten) branches of the <i>fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle </i>Zionist imaginary shared this play of past, present, and future, as well as the dialectical presence/absence fantasies present in the above texts of Wagner, Bettauer, and Bahr.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Zionist writings, youth movements, international congresses and the like further nourished these discourses in turn, setting on a grand stage, as it were, fantasies of a Jewish withdrawal from European modernity and the inauguration of a different future utopia, just as their relentless critiques of assimilation echoed those of Wagner's successors. Zionism was nothing if not Jewish modernism in all these senses. </p>

<p>Clearly the complexity of the relations between the res of modernism and of Jewishness stems in no small part from the famously ambiguous status of modernism itself, as well as its relationship to modernity on the one hand and popular culture on the other.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The discourse on "Jewish modernism" in the German-language context, I am arguing, encompasses these very tensions, giving them specific form. While this discourse is surely one that took familiar form over the course of the last half of the nineteenth century and remained intact through the first half of the twentieth, the Jew and so-called Jewish question already played central roles in German Enlightenment discourse, representing, as it were, the tension between universalism and particularity.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  But the German (including German-speaking Austrian) eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were not haunted by a discourse on Jews until the mid-nineteenth century, and by the 1880s onward the culture was saturated by it. While it would be too much to claim that to speak of "die Moderne" after Jewish emancipation was to speak of Jews, a linkage of these res in the period cannot easily be dismissed. It is hence a somewhat counter-historical exercise to seek to reconstruct a German discourse on the modern or "modernism" purged of reference to Jews, Judaism, or Jewishness. This is odd because modernism, in at least one of its principle contemporary versions, stood for a presumed anti-contextualism as well as an anti-historicism; it famously made a claim for aesthetic autonomy.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This is a contradiction at the core of the whole notion 

<b></b>

 of Jewish modernism. There is no reason to rehash a difficult discussion of aesthetic autonomy here, or to evaluate the difference between the program and practice of "art for art's sake"; our concern is rather with the relationship of programmatic modernism and its histories (or criticisms). We have seen how antisemitic and philosemitic programmatic statements on the Modern seem to bear an unshakeable rhetorical kinship with German and Jewish studies treatments of them, so that in some cases they are structurally identical. Similarly, certain critical methodologies such as the American post-war New Criticism shared distinct elective affinities with aestheticist formalism, such that our contemporary critical discourse on modernism developed in a mutually reflexive relationship to it.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  In other words, if German-Jewish studies cannot help but posit a modernism as inexorably "Jewish" as the antisemites', there is also an insufficiently historicized criticism of modernism that is stripped of these associations. But this "modernism without Jews" is not a history of German modernism freed from its antisemitic discursive associations, but a disavowal. </p>

<p>Paul de Man's influential essay "Literary History and Literary Modernity" would seem to be an account of modernism without Jews; in its sly use of the term "literary modernity," it seems to be able to do even without "modernism".<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  De Man's essay, at its core an exegesis of one of Nietzsche's short pieces from the <i>Untimely Meditations</i>, became exemplary for a generation of literary critics (although not historians) interested in a modernism that was neither a static descriptor of literary history nor a self-cannibalizing category of aesthetic formalism free of context. De Man sees the category (again, "modernity" rather than modernism) emerging as ideological weapon, theoretical problem, and promising link between theory and praxis.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  This discussion of modernism leads provocatively to a lucid statement about the textuality of history: that intensive textual interpretation is true historical work, and that historical phenomena are texts in other guise.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>   </p>

<p>While influential, de Man's essay is often misunderstood. Many readers see it as casting (or recasting, after Nietzsche) an ironclad binary of history and the modern.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  That binary is the starting point rather than de Man's own polemic&#x2014;the presumed opposition of history and the modern is what he took to be obvious, modernism's own self-mythology. In Carl Schorske's words, the modernists "all broke, more or less deliberately, their ties to the historical outlook central to the nineteenth-century liberal culture in which they had been reared".<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  The opposition between "history" and "modern" is established in de Man's text (and, in his reading, in Nietzsche's) only to be broken down: modernism's concern for futurity implicates it at once in the "chain" of history; its self-consciousness entails reflection, even as it demands a spontaneity at odds with such reflection: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Considered as a principle of life, modernity becomes a principle of origination and turns at once into a generative power that is itself historical. It becomes impossible to overcome 

<b></b>

 history in the name of life or forget the past in the name of modernity, because both are linked by a temporal chain that gives them a common destiny &#x2026; <i>Modernity and history relate to each other in a curiously contradictory way that goes beyond antithesis or opposition.</i> If history is not to become sheer regression or paralysis, it depends on modernity for its duration and renewal; but modernity cannot assert itself without being at once swallowed up and reintegrated into a regressive historical process. &#x2026; Modernity and history seem condemned to being linked together in a self-destroying union that threatens the survival of both.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>De Man very clearly identifies the relation between history and modernity in Nietzsche's text with the trope of <i>aporia</i>. This re, which in classical rhetoric signified the moment of real or feigned undecideability between two mutually contradictory positions presented by a speaker (from the Greek for "impassable"), was a privileged one for practitioners of deconstruction. For a reader like de Man, this prime trope of doubt and undecideability points to the paradox wherein the conditions of possibility of something like "modern" are also the elements blocking its existence.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Nietzsche does not so much argue for modernity against history (the Nietzschean "Now" against historicist reflection), according to de Man, but rather his own text is caught in the aporia of reflection and immediacy, of history and the modern. This reading is persuasive. Still more interesting than its accuracy is its mirror-like identical inversion of the position of Walter Benjamin familiar to so many in German studies: the dialectical image, frozen in a lightening-moment in which the then and the now, history and the modern, coincide.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  De Man does not mention Benjamin in this essay, and the latter's presence lingers in implication only. The "aporetic" in de Man's usage could be seen in contrast to the "dialectical"; of course the former term is the one that emerges from literary criticism, rhetorics or tropology; dialectics is the historical concept. By insisting on the aporetic rather than dialectical relation of the terms reflection and spontaneity (or history and modern), de Man, with Nietzsche, refuses the primacy of history while insisting on keeping it braided with the modern within a single knot. If that knot does not bear the name "Jewish modernism," that is so in part because of the conspicuous absence not only of Benjamin but of other prime subjects of German(/Jewish) studies whose projects describe the collision of reflection and spontaneity, namely Freud, or history and modernization, like Marx.  </p>

<p>The deconstructionist taste for aporia&#x2014;if anyone indulged in it more often and more idiosyncratically than de Man, it was Derrida&#x2014;reminded these thinkers' critics of the accusation of moral relativism. That is certainly a debate that is too expansive and too distant from our discussion of Jewish modernism to be included here. Yet, it is worth mentioning that this criticism reached its most fevered pitch around an affair involving issues very close to those we have been discussing. Attackers' of a wide range of theoretical work in literary criticism came to claim that this critical work was tainted, and could not be seen without reference to the historical fact of the author's collaboration. A particularly influential report by Jon Wiener in <i>The Nation</i>, for instance, specifically cited de Man's "Literary History and Literary Modernity" as evidence of the objectives of "Deconstruction," namely to "[free] literature from context and history.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 But de Man's claim in this essay we have been discussing was precisely not that history should be ignored, in the name of aesthetic autonomy; rather, he asserted that intense scrutiny to the work on its own terms would constitute historical work. Real formalism&#x2014;the rejection of history and context of the New Criticism, for example&#x2014;he attacked ruthlessly.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  </p>

<p>At the center of the sensation was a piece a twenty-one-year-old de Man had written on the subject of "Jews and contemporary literature."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  In this one-page contribution, it cannot be disputed that de Man enlists antisemitic discourse, but the question of how he engages it has been the object of some discussion. For the major thrust of the article is without doubt contrary to the central thrust of the Nazi antisemitic view of the role of the Jews in modern culture: the accusation about a penetrating Jewish presence in modern culture is a "lapidary judgment," a product of "vulgar antisemitism" or even a "myth" spread in part by the Jews themselves; but modern European culture, far from being "jewified" (<i>enjuiv&#x00E9;, </i>the standard contemporary translation of <i>verjudet</i>), was healthy at its root, not fundamentally affected by the relatively minor Jewish participation, and indeed, an imagined solution to the Jewish question involving the Jews' isolation from Europe would "not entail, for the literary life of the West, deplorable consequences."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  A complex case, to be sure&#x2014;blatantly antisemitic discourse deployed in a way that undermines the ideology? To interpret this appalling text, readers have to contextualize it, historicize it, in different ways. They recall the immediate context of de Man's collaborationist activity, and his apparent resistance to contribute to this special issue of <i>Le Soir</i> on Jews and literature, for instance; some readers focus on de Man's involvement in a group on the anti-fascist and democratic left not long before this moment; for critics, the future doctrines of de Man's literary theory would be as crucial a context as those more immediate to this text.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>   </p>

<p>For our own purposes, we note perhaps that this 1941 de Man, like exterminationist antisemites of his time no more or less than the murdered Hugo Bettauer, posits a European modernity without Jews as a rhetorical strategy. We have come full circle back to Wagner's essay "Modern" a century before: both imagine a modern popular sphere (for de Man the "phony and disordered existence of Europe since 1920") rife with Jewish influence, and both determine that this Jewish sphere has not touched true art. And so, in de Man's writing, another pair of bookends&#x2014;at one end, modern literature without Jews, at the other a literary modernity that sublates history and leaves both Jewishness and antisemitism unspoken. Jewish presence/absence, history and the modern, face one another in an impassable encounter&#x2014;an aporia. </p>

<p>When my subtitle only somewhat ironically announced that this discussion of Jewish modernism would be "counter-historical," there were several competing meanings at work. This is necessarily so, in light of the similarly concurrent and conflicting strands of "Jewish modernism" itself. Some of the reference points of Jewish modernism and counter-history map on to one another neatly: the Zionist Jewish <i>Moderne </i>immediately 

<b></b>

 concerned itself with the self-conscious effort to remake Jewish destiny by resisting its own lachrymose history&#x2014;instead of being subjected by history, the new, creative and activist Jews would reauthor themselves. David Biale embodied the term with new life in his study of Gershom Scholem, where he suggested that the revival and reinterpretations of Jewish mystical tradition rewrote the story Judaism told itself about its own rationalist and legalistic core.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  While the Zionist "muscle-Jew" and his counterpart student with Rosenzweig's <i>Star of Redemption</i> under his arm may have had little to say to each other, both were "Jewish modernists" concerned with the innovative and even redemptive moment that came in an engagement with a Jewish historical essence that was also a refusal; an insistence on identifying with a Jewish "essence" that other Jews would have found alien. This complex pattern of identification and dis-identification with history&#x2014;closely linked to a focus on the redemptive inauguration of a utopian future&#x2014;is not far at all from the contemporary discourses on Jewish modernism by self-identified non-Jewish Germans. These Jewish modernisms, as we have seen, entailed their own versions of counter-history, imagining what various modernisms and modernities would look like if purged of the historical presence of Jews. To be clear, my argument is not that all of these different discourses are in concord with one another, describing a same or similar <i>Moderne</i>, Jewish in one and the same way; rather, to regard all of these preoccupations as part of a landscape, to stand back and blur the eyes, is to draw out a field of tension among res of self and other, past and future, text and author. This murky and ambivalent field is covered, as it were, by the name Jewish modernism, rather than denoted by it.  </p>

<p>Technically speaking, a counter-historical argument is a rumination about the succession of past events that relies upon a counter-factual premise, for example, "If Hindenburg had not appointed Hitler chancellor of the Reich in 1933," "If the Jews had not been emancipated," or "Had the Weimar Constitution not included the Emergency Powers provision&#x2026;" While historians have traditionally espoused skepticism regarding the legitimacy of counter-historical arguments, implicitly many if not most historical arguments rely on such premises. A recent interest in counterfactuals and history has surfaced, as a flurry of conference panels and publications seems to indicate.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  While eccentric imaginary historical experiments are a staple of a genre of popular counterfactual history, professional historians are more comfortable with counter-historical arguments based on realistic premises.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Upon examination, many historical arguments utilize implicitly counterfactual reasoning: In asserting the association of Viennese modernism and its Jews, for instance, Beller in his <i>Vienna and the Jews</i> must silently imagine what that modernism would have looked like without them. German-Jewish studies, no matter how patently historical, hence often resorts to premises that might be as extravagant as the statement, "if turn-of-the-century Vienna had no Jews&#x2026;" To analyze the Jewish influence on the work of a Kafka, a Freud, a Marx, or a Mahler does after all suggest that their work would have to have been essentially different if they were <i>not</i> Jews.  </p>

<p>For our purposes, I wonder if a counter-historical exercise of precisely this extravagance would not be useful to flesh out our historiographical dilemma and its consistent 

<b></b>

 entanglement with the problematics of "Jewish modernism." Generations of scholarship, invective, and silent public opinion have culled meaning from the relationship of texts like "On the Jewish Question," <i>Moses and Monotheism</i>, and so on, to the facts of the Jewish origins of their authors' families. There is no use disputing that many deep insights into these and a great many works more remote to Judaism have been made on the basis of this contextualization. But what if it were now to be discovered that these artists and thinkers, or one of them, did <i>not </i>actually have Jewish origins, that this had just been assumed on the basis of a later manipulation of the historical record, or a mistake? Too much of a stretch, surely, to imagine, but it must be confessed that a text like either of the two mentioned<i> could</i> be authored by someone with no discernable Jewish origins, and in that case, would have to be interpreted differently. We could perform this eccentric experiment in another way, no less stark: what if the author of the <i>Genealogy of Morals</i>, Friedrich Nietzsche, were the son not of a Lutheran minister, but, like Marx, of a convert from Judaism? From an intellectual historical perspective, it is an absurd premise&#x2014;the life of Nietzsche would have been utterly different had this been the case, the environment informing the oeuvre completely different, the professional training and trajectory impossible. Yet, we can say with certainty that if this were the case, and we had before us the text <i>Genealogy of Morals</i>, shelves of its interpretation would be saturated with references to the author's relationship to his Judaism, the Jewish education or popular knowledge informing the text, Jewish self-hatred, the context of antisemitism, and so on. And, <i>voil&#x00E1;</i>! Suddenly we have a cornerstone of the canon of Jewish modernism.  </p>

<p>Cultural historians (including myself) are convinced that texts, res, and ideas are embedded&#x2014;they have a relationship to their given historical contexts and are unthinkable without them. Thinkers like de Man offer the possibility of unthinking this truism. What is called the "autonomy" of the text or of art can really be seen as a willed assertion, a hypothesis: <i>what if</i> texts/works/res could be understood outside of the presumed overdetermined contexts of their authorship?<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  </p>

<p>My question in this essay is somewhat different: How are we to historicize "Jewish modernism"? How is it to be defined, how can it even be invoked without immediately falling into the traps set by its own violent history? A common strategy for historicizing a concept, movement, or work calls for an excavation of an author's origins and intentions, but the difficult case of Jewish modernism shows that there are reasons to take a step back from this model of contextualization. The constellation of disparate historical moments I have organized here under the rubric "Jewish modernism" is intended to bring these reasons into relief, and to provide a context of a different sort&#x2014;one that helps situate an elusive object that is not a body of work nor a register of authors, but a way of thinking about oneself and one's place in relation to the past, the future, and creativity.

The locus classicus for this observation is the 1850 essay, "Judaism in Music," but the explicit and polemical antisemitism of this and other essays can be read as contexts for the aesthetic program in essays on "Art and Revolution," "The Art Work of the Future," and others. In "Judaism in Music," the most often cited piece in regard to Wagner's programmatic antisemitism, the author assumes a recognizably alien relationship of Jews to European art; much later essays like "Modern" and "What is German?" express the more nefarious linkage of Jews to modern German culture that is particularly relevant to our inquiry. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>. In short, a "neutral" position identifies and historicizes an antisemitic strain in the socio-cultural critique essays, usually focusing particularly on "Judaism in Music," and brackets the question of a relationship between these opinions and the artistic work, see e.g. Dieter Borchmeyer's excellent summary in Ulrich M&#x00FC;ller and Peter Wapnewski, <i>Richard-Wagner-Handbuch</i> (Stuttgart: Alfred Kr&#x00F6;ner, 1986): 137&#x2013;61; many lengthy studies avoid discussion of this element, and where they handle it cursorily, tend to dismiss it, e.g. Curt von Westernhagen, tr. Mary Whittall, <i>Wagner. A Biography</i>, 2 vols (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1978); some treatments deal with the problem at length but ultimately apologetically, considering antisemitic attitudes to be discrete artifacts of Wagner's milieu&#x2014;one source for instance equates his views on Jews with those of Marx and Disraeli, see L. J. Rather, <i>Reading Wagner: A Study in the History of Ideas</i> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1990): 114&#x2013;217; many even argue that the "Judaism" essay was nothing more than a personal attack on Meyerbeer (who is not named in the essay). Since T. W. Adorno's <i>Versuch &#x00FC;ber Wagner</i> (Frankfurt a.M.: Suhrkamp, 1952), various studies have tried to relate the antisemitism of the essays to the content, form, imagery, or score of the music dramas, see esp. Marc A. Weiner, <i>Richard Wagner and the Anti-Semitic Imagination </i>(Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 1995), David J. Levin, <i>Richard Wagner, Fritz Lang, and the Nibelungen</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1998); most recently, Wolf-Daniel Hartwich offers a reading of this relation that goes furthest beyond looking for Jewish allegory in the dramas, see <i>Romantischer Antisemitismus.

Birnbaum's Zionism floated from an emphasis on territory in Palestine to "present-work" focusing on the welfare and education of Jews in the diaspora or exile (<i>Golus</i>), to a return to religious orthodoxy. More than one commentator has seen in this complexity or even inconsistency the key to his relatively low status in the Zionist pantheon (in spite of apparently having coined the movement's name). See Henryk Broder, "Nicht alle Wege f&#x00FC;hren nach Jerusalem. Nathan Birnbaum&#x2014;von der Geschichte vergessen," in Birnbaum, <i>Fr&#x00FC;he zionistische</i>: 7&#x2013;15; cf.

A similar result, from the opposite direction, was achieved by Noah Isenberg in his <i>Between Redemption and Doom: The Strains of German-Jewish Modernism</i> (Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska, 1999), which consisted of case studies of three Jewish contributors to the German modernist canon (Kafka, Arnold Zweig, and Walter Benjamin), and one of the Jewish-themed film <i>Der Golem</i>.

The difficult problem of the "dialectical image" is not exactly a historical or narrative model in the sense that dialectics in classical Hegelianism and Marxism have been, in that it "freezes" a dialectical moment rather than moving forward; it is also different from de Man's aporia in that it freezes the then and the now together in an active and spontaneous way, rather than at an aporetic impasse. Frequently, Benjamin's "messianic" revisions of Western Marxism are explained, again, by resorting to the fact of his German-Jewish background. A symptomatic example that is expressly relevant to the problematic explored in this essay is Robert Alter, <i>Necessary Angels: Tradition and Modernity in Kafka, Benjamin, and Scholem</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991). </p>

<p><a name="FOOT51" href="#REF51">51</a>. The most recent conference of the American Historical Association (Philadelphia, 2006) featured an Association-sponsored roundtable entitled "Not Just a 'Parlour Game' Anymore: Counterfactual History in the Historical Mainstream." In 2004, the professional organ of the association published an article on the issue of counterfactual history and created an online forum for a discussion. See Martin Bunzl, "Counterfactual History: A User's Guide," <i>American Historical Review</i> vol. 109, no. 3 (June 2004) &lt;<a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/109.3/bunzl.htm">http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/109.3/bunzl.htm</a>l&gt; (21 Feb. 2006). The general direction of these discussions seems to be not only to diagnose the phenomenon of the resurgence of counterfactual history, but to consider what its appropriate methods, boundaries, and applications are. Richard Ned Lebow, in "What's So Different about a Counterfactual?" <i>World Politics</i> 52, no. 4 (July 2000): 550&#x2013;585, argues that counterfactual historical arguments are not inherently different from factual ones, although the examples he reviews are logically deficient in his view. An influential collection to this field was Niall Fergusen, ed., <i>Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals</i> (New York: Macmillan, 1997). On the level of popular history, an example is the Robert Cowley series <i>What If? Eminent Historians Imagine What Might Have Been</i> (New York: Putnam, 2001) and his earlier volume focusing on military history; Steve Tally, <i>Almost America: From Colonists to Clinton: a "What If" History of the United States</i> (New York: HarperCollins, 2000), and a veritable spate of fantastical books with titles such as <i>Roads Not Taken, History that Never Was, The Way It Wasn't, </i>and <i>Alternate History Stories.</i> </p>

<p><a name="FOOT53" href="#REF53">53</a>. Distinct but related hypotheses are posited by the well-known essays by Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault assessing the problem of authorship: See R. Barthes, "The Death of the Author," <i>Image, Music, Text</i> ed. and trans. Stephen Heath (New York: Hill, 1977): 142&#x2013;48, and Michel Foucault, "What is an Author?" trans. Donald F. Bouchard and Sherry Simon, in <i>Language, Counter-Memory, Practice</i>, ed. Donald F. Bouchard (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1977): 124&#x2013;127. These texts could be said not only to be well-known, but widely influential, like de Man's essay, which was published close to the time these essays came out in English translation. Nonetheless, that influence does not seem to have extended to Jewish and German studies treatments of Jewish modernism. The problematic of authorship is a central strand of the discourse complex I have been discussing under this rubric. For the discursive complex of "Jewish modernism," it seems important to remember Barthes' old claim that in writing "everything is to be <i>disentangled</i>, nothing <i>deciphered.</i>" </p>
