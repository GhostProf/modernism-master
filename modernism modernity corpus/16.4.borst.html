	      Notoriously linked and frequently besmirched as racist or exploitative of black cultural stereotypes, Carl Van Vechten’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>  and Claude McKay’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>  juxtapose Harlem’s emergent black middle class, seeking education and cultural refinement, with the decadence and debauchery of cabarets, speakeasies, gambling, pimping, interracial sexuality, homosexuality, and myriad intoxications. Dismissing these representations of Harlem’s sordid underbelly as mere sensationalism, reckless bookselling fodder, or even racial betrayal, as a range of notable critics once did, at once obfuscates black and African-American socio-economic hierarchies and elides the complex cultural exchanges made possible by Harlem’s thriving Prohibition-era culture.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Through meticulous descriptions of cabarets, speakeasies, and urban pleasure-seekers, Van Vechten and McKay illuminate a nascent subculture of jazz and intoxication that is not antithetical, but integral, to the history of Harlem’s New Negro community. Hedonistic or not, the sites and activities associated with Harlem’s nightlife enabled substantial and dynamic cultural exchanges that far exceed primitivist fantasies and trendy exoticism.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	      Even if <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> “were not designed to elucidate a complex human existence,” as Houston A. Baker, Jr. once proclaimed, they nonetheless record how what I call the jazz-addict subculture interlocked with the broader, socioeconomic issues impacting the New Negro community.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In fact, Baker’s own “blues matrix” and “blues geographies” are especially useful concepts that help elucidate the political and aesthetic forces at play in and around the jazz-addict subculture.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Baker writes that, “The matrix is a point of ceaseless input and output, a web of intersecting, crisscrossing impulses always in productive transit.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> This blues matrix designates the intricate wellspring of African-American cultural potentiality. In both novels, such potentiality flourishes in a multiplicity of inputs, outputs, intersections, and impulses that trigger and sustain the jazz-addict subculture.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      This essay begins by considering how the underground blues geography of Harlem’s cabarets and speakeasies gave rise to the jazz-addict subculture and how this subculture situated itself spatially and ideologically in relation to the political terrain of Harlem’s New Negro community. The essay then engages with two pivotal aesthetic features of the novels and the subculture they depict. First considered is the authors’ use of a Signifyin(g) black vernacular, to use Henry Louis Gates’s term, which amplifies the coalescing sounds of jazz and drug vocabularies. Van Vechten and McKay show how a jazz-addict vernacular becomes a mark of distinction that separates the subculture from its New Negro neighbors, and how its linguistic structure mirrors the subculture’s investment in dynamic, flexible, and improvisatory cultural exchange. The essay concludes by discussing how Van Vechten and McKay produce Harlem Renaissance adaptations of the Orientalist fantasies modeled by Thomas De Quincey, Samuel Coleridge, and Charles Baudelaire in attempts to describe drug-induced hallucinations and the general saturnalia of the jazz-addict subculture. By supplementing the black vernacular descriptions of spaces, people, and sounds with the imagery and textures of the romanticist experience of being on drugs, Van Vechten and McKay effectively locate an Afro-Orientalist imagination thriving within Harlem—an imagination that is not merely indulgent exoticism, but an active political part of the Harlem Renaissance.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Space, Style, Subculture</h1>
<p>
		It is perhaps W. E. B. Du Bois who best pinpointed a key conflict of cultural and and geographical values that ostensibly exacerbated the rift between the jazz-addict subculture and certain members of the New Negro community. Du Bois’s vision of Harlem tied the success of social advancement to the neighborhood’s physical and cultural growth. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Empire</span>, Michelle Stephens explains how Du Bois stressed the importance of “a rootedness in Harlem [that underscored] a belief in the steady advance of black life in America through class mobility, racial integration, and national citizenship.” Pursuant to this vision, Du Bois wanted representations of Harlem to highlight the most validating aspects of the community. McKay, who, according to Stephens, was inspired by a similar vision of Harlem, chose instead to “[portray] those marginal res in Harlem who had no access to Du Bois’s narrative of upward  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> mobility—the unemployed, the drifters, the criminal.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Hence the famous bath that Du Bois felt he needed after reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>. Du Bois had a similar reaction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and bluntly wrote in <span style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span> that, “Harlem is no such place as that.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Aside from decrying Van Vechten’s portrayal of Harlem, Du Bois’s comment reflected that the dispute in defining Harlem as a place had as much to do with its territorial distinction from the rest of New York City and white culture, as it had to do with the internal, territorial politics of the New Negro community. As Hazel Carby contends, “The twenties must be viewed as a period of ideological, political, and cultural contestation between an emergent black bourgeoisie and an emerging urban black working class.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, Van Vechten and McKay demonstrate how such socio-economic contests map on to the spatial quarrels that Du Bois repeatedly discussed. Accordingly, this section examines how the jazz-addict subculture launched its political and cultural expression spatially and how this subculture thereby factored into the feverishly debated organization of labor, leisure, and class within the Harlem community.
	      </p>
<p>
		In his now classic study, <span style="font-style:italic;">Subculture: The Meaning of Style</span>, Dick Hebdige connects the emergence of a subculture directly to its situated space in the community. He explains that, “the experience encoded in subcultures is shaped in a variety of locales (work, home, school, etc.). Each of these locales imposes its own unique structure, its own rules and meanings, its own hierarchy of values.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> For the jazz-addict subculture, cabarets and speakeasies housed a distinct set of “subversive” and “subterranean” values (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 3, 76). These subcultural locales manifested veritable flea markets of transgressive and taboo wares and, as Lewis A. Erenberg writes, “provided settings for the fantasies money might buy.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> In historian Ronald L. Morris’s words, “Clubs remained open all hours, accommodating every trade, taste, and temptation. Whatever his or her work schedule, the customer was at least assured of finding some convivial little cellar haunt . . . in which to escape and unwind . . . . In the case of the wealthy . . . illicit pleasures were unlimited.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Instead of making an illicit buy and then slinking home, one stayed in the cabaret or speakeasy in order to purchase, interact with, and ingest the market. As a result, these subcultural locales were a spawning ground for style: “The challenge to hegemony which subcultures represent is . . . expressed obliquely, in style” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 17).
	      </p>
<p>
		In the cabaret and the speakeasy, style meant jazz and blues, dancing the Charleston and the Black Bottom, widespread intoxication, uninhibited social and sexual combinations, and the efflorescence of a distinct jazz-addict vernacular. It is <span style="font-style:italic;">this</span> Harlem for which Jake yearns at the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, and it is of this style that the controversial prologue to <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> offers an acute study. Jake, whose First World War service kept him abroad, believes the women of Harlem “were calling him.” He fantasizes about “‘Them tantalizing brown legs! . . . Barron’s Cabaret! . . . Leroy’s Cabaret! . . . Oh, boy!’”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> On his return, Jake reimmerses himself into the spaces, the noises, the tastes, and the language of Harlem and its subcultural locales: “Oh, to be in Harlem again after two years away. The deep-dyed color, the thickness, the closeness of it. The noises of Harlem. The sugared laughter. The honey-talk on its streets. And all night long, ragtime and ‘blues’ playing somewhere, . . . singing somewhere, dancing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> somewhere! Oh, the contagious fever of Harlem . . . . Burning now in Jake’s sweet blood . . . .” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 15). As Michael Maiwald suggests, Jake identifies with a world that conforms neither to the rules of white culture nor the business-professional model of New Negro racial uplift. Instead, he embraces a “moral code that rejects exploitation as a means of livelihood and the economic as the central mode of human existence: Jake finds his values outside of surplus value.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Hence, Jake opts for the style embedded in the “contagious fever,” the syncopated rhythms, the street vernacular, the subterranean excitement of cabarets and speakeasies.
	      </p>
<p>
		By comparison, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> begins with the gigolo-like character Anatole Longfellow, also known as the Scarlet Creeper, swaggering along the Harlem streets toward the Black Venus cabaret.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> As he does throughout the novel, Van Vechten treats his eccentric character to a full blazon, detailing his “tight-fitting suit of shepherd’s plaid,” “a great diamond, or some less valuable stone which aped a diamond, [that] glistened in his fuchsia cravat,” and an “ebony cane, tipped with a ball of ivory” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 3–5). The Scarlet Creeper picks up Ruby Silver, a girl in a crowd of “pleasure seekers,” and takes her out for a night of jazz, dancing, and “tea for two” (code for gin with ginger ale). Inside, the Black Venus vibrates with “intoxicating rhythm”: “On all sides of the swaying couple, bodies in picturesque costumes rocked, black bodies, brown bodies, high yellows, a kaleidoscope of colour transred by the amber searchlight . . . . The band snored and snorted and whistled and laughed like a hyena” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 13–14). These ebullient partiers, animalistic noises, hot jazz, sexual intimacy, drinking, and drug-use return throughout the novel, each time exhibiting what Kevin J. Mumford calls “the human geography of the interzones.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>
		In <span style="font-style:italic;">Interzones</span>, his study of Chicago and New York sex districts in the early twentieth century, Mumford examines the production of subjectivity within urban vice districts. These interzones, which include Harlem cabarets and speakeasies, are both “spatial and ideological [by] definition,” are “simultaneously marginal and central,” and “should be understood as the foremost areas of cultural, sexual, and social interchange” (<span style="font-style:italic;">I</span>, 20). Elsewhere, Barry Milligan uses the phrase “bilateral cultural exchange” to describe a similar phenomenon taking place in the nineteenth-century opium dens of London’s East End. Milligan refers to these opium dens as “miniature Orients within the heart of the British Empire” and describes them as spaces where institutions give way to instability, and class, racial, and legal boundaries falter.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Milligan suggests that addiction subcultures are at once produced by a specialized space of transgressive behavior, like interzones, and also produce new multiracial and cultural exchanges that exceed—in fact, refuse—the hegemonic social boundaries of the dominant culture. Like opium dens, Harlem cabarets and speakeasies indulged their patrons’ allegiance to an array of transgressive options. And despite being somewhat artificial environments, these interzones fostered an authentic subcultural style. Given its multitude of interacting lifestyles, the underground cosmopolitanism of the jazz-addict subculture manifested an alternative world of choice far more egalitarian than the marketplace of ideas and commodities advertised by white capitalism or more conservative versions of New Negro identity.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		To the culturally and economically elite segment of the New Negro community, which David Levering Lewis describes, <span style="font-style:italic;">à la</span> Du Bois, as the Talented Tenth, these underground activities and attitudes stood at odds with the rise of the New Negro and threatened the community’s legitimacy by pandering to white slumming and primitivist fantasies.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> To Du Bois, Harlem’s cabarets and speakeasies were no better than “a nasty, sordid corner into which black folks [were] herded, and yet a place which they in crass ignorance [were] fools enough to enjoy.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Unlike Du Bois, who voiced the Talented Tenth’s antimony for these interzones, Hebdige emphasizes that one should understand “the idea of [subcultural] style as a coded response to changes affecting the entire community” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 80). In a comparable analysis of British mod culture, Hebdige suggests that, “The mods were negotiating changes and contradictions which were simultaneously affecting the parent culture but they were doing so in the terms of their own relatively autonomous problematic—by inventing an ‘elsewhere’ (the week-end, the West End) which was defined <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> the familiar locales” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 79). No doubt, the “elsewhere” of the jazz-addict subculture issued explicit challenges to the New Negro model endorsed by Du Bois’s Progressive-minded Talented Tenth. But as Van Vechten’s and McKay’s novels indicate, the jazz-addict subculture also levied sophisticated responses to issues that occupied the rest of the New Negro community, including white hegemony, Jim Crow politics, American capitalism, and the general rise of modernity.
	      </p>
<p>
		In addition to examining the impact of white slumming on Harlem’s geographic relationship to the white world, Van Vechten and McKay illuminate moments when the jazz-addict subculture and the rest of the New Negro community combine to demarcate and push Harlem’s boundaries into the white world. One scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> shows a complex intermingling of the working world and the jazz-addict subculture. At seven in the morning, on his way to a new job, Byron Kasson joins a mass of Harlemites heading to white neighborhoods to work as messenger boys and servant-girls. Byron admires the independence and patent happiness they find living in Harlem: “they refused to ‘live in.’ The white world might do its best to rob their days of pleasure, but they could always look forward to the evening” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 188). As he joins this “procession of an oppressed people” to “labour in an alien world,” he passes a cabaret emptying of its working-class partiers (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 187). The partiers join the procession: “They had had no sleep. After a night devoted to gaiety they were returning to take their places as pawns in this strange game of toil that the white world insisted upon playing” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 188). In this moment when labor and leisure converge, the refusal to “live in” as servants in the home of white employers takes on additional significance. By <span style="font-style:italic;">going out</span> to the cabaret all night, the partiers also refuse to “live in”; they do not worry about replenishing their labor-power, instead pursuing entertainment and cultural activity that disobeys approved standards of behavior. Byron, who struggles throughout the novel to become a cultural and professional elite, cannot reconcile his staunch individualism with this confluence of different Harlemites. He resignedly observes that as these two segments of Harlem’s working class press into a train together, they coalesce into a unified, undifferentiated mass, as the white world mistakenly views them.
	      </p>
<p>
		In McKay’s novel, during a move from one cabaret to the next, Jake and Felice stroll down the “Block Beautiful,” a white block struggling to hold its ground against  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Harlem’s expanding boundaries. While its white inhabitants sleep, the Block Beautiful offers a romantic promenade for Harlem’s late-night pleasure-seekers. In a meeting of architecture and allegory, an iconic Presbyterian church monumentalizes the block’s “ancient sepulchral Respectability”; it gives the block’s white denizens “moral courage” and yet it “frowned on the corner like a fortress against the invasion” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 300). Against this austere white traditionalism, Jake and Felice represent the approach of both the excesses of the jazz-addict subculture and a New Negro middle class with the financial wherewithal to settle on the most notable streets. While Van Vechten observes a daily movement of African-American laborers heading into white neighborhoods, McKay considers also the more permanent influx of New Negroes into white urban space and the resulting white flight: “That was the limit: the desecrating of that atmosphere by black love in the very shadow of the gray, gaunt Protestant church. The Ancient Respectability was getting ready to flee . . . .” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 301).
	      </p>
<p>
		Within the Harlem limits, the politics of identity and territory are even more complex. While Van Vechten and McKay show how the Scarlet Creeper and Jake find room for stylistic self-definition within the interzones, they also consider how the emerging African-American middle class and the Talented Tenth continually negotiate individual and class identities in relation to the jazz-addict subculture. On one level, characters like Mary, Byron, and Ray, each frustrated in their own way with New Negro life, experiment with the jazz-addict subculture as they search for temporary reprieve from the trials of class-climbing amid institutional racism. On a whole other level, the characters who establish their own socio-economic identities by aggressively disparaging or mocking the jazz-addict subculture tend to adopt extraordinarily conflicted, even hypocritical, positions. Indeed, both novels present jazz, cabarets, and interracial affairs as the lurid, gossipy conversation of drunken upper-class and aspiring middle-class characters that strive to differentiate their own decadent habits from the stereotypes of Harlem’s seedy underworld.
	      </p>
<p>
		In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, Adora Boniface, whom Van Vechten modeled after A’Lelia Walker, is a former music hall star and the wealthy widow of a Harlem real-estate tycoon.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> When living in the city, she spends her time amid the lavish decorations, antique furniture, and potpourri of museum pieces in her home on “Strivers’ Row,” the ritzy stretch of Harlem’s 139th Street populated by wealthy prizeters, bandleaders, and professionals. The weekend-long “orgies” at her Long Island estate provide an alternative space for intoxication, jazz, and dancing the Charleston. These extravagant parties for her upper- and middle-class cohorts come complete with notable jazz bands imported from the city and an endless supply of booze: “Gin, indeed, flowed as freely as if there had been a natural spring of it, while whisky, Scotch, rye, and Bourbon, was almost equally plentiful” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 22). Adora even invites Randolph Pettijohn (the Bolito King), a Harlem cabaret owner who runs an illegal lottery. Despite Pettijohn’s attendance and the resemblance between Adora’s crowd and cabaret patrons, this world is always set apart from Harlem’s underground nightlife. Adora disparages the naïveté of workingclass African-Americans and tells Mary Love that success for African-American women means marrying rich.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		Similarly, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, McKay’s Gin-head Susy demonstrates how having access to intoxicants without having to patronize nightclubs widens the gulf between the jazz-addict subculture and its opponents. In her Brooklyn apartment, Gin-head Susy frequently hosts private parties with gin, whisky, and beer, and like Adora, she leverages her money and her ability to furnish booze against the appeal of Harlem. She prohibits her boyfriend Zeddy, who is “living sweet” off her money, from going to Harlem for entertainment. Attacking Harlem nightlife, she says, “What makes you niggers love Harlem so much? Because it’s a blood ungodly place where niggers nevah go to bed. All night running around speakeasies and cabarets, where bad, hell-bent nigger women am giving themselves open to sin” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 79). During an impromptu visit to Harlem, she later declares, “This here Harlem is a stinking sink of iniquity. Nigger hell!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 99). Playing on the same slang term that Van Vechten took for his novel’s title, Gin-head Susy coopts and reconres the structural rules of racial segregation to exclude herself from the jazz-addict subculture of Harlem.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
		While Adora and Gin-head Susy both arrange private debauches for their friends, they remain adamant about their elite status and their distance from the jazz-addict subculture. No matter how drunken and orgiastic their parties become, Adora and Gin-head Susy remove the music and intoxication from the subcultural locale; their parties remain separate from the jazz-addict subculture because they maintain a secure perimeter. They are not interzones, and therefore they lack the distinct combination of space, style, and bilateral cultural exchange that sustain the subculture.
	      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Pink-chasers, Happy Dust, and the Jazz-Addict Glossary</h1>
<p>
		Perhaps no better evidence reveals the importance of the interzones and bilateral cultural exchange to the jazz-addict subculture than its language. Take, for instance, a scene important to both the queer and linguistic politics of <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>. Ray, the well-educated and friendly Haitian railcar waiter, teaches Jake about the history of Sappho.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Returning the instructional favor, Jake tells Ray that in Harlem they call lesbians and gays “bulldykers” and “faggoty men” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 129). The scene not only verbalizes how different forms of cultural capital separate Jake and Ray, but it also goes on to demonstrate how the material space of the Harlem underground spawns vernacular exchange. After reading from Ray’s copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sapho</span> by Alphonse Daudet, Jake exclaims “Bumbole!” and remarks that the speech in the novel fails to represent the spoken language he knows (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 129). McKay reveals that, “‘Bumbole’ was now a popular expletive for Jake, replacing such expressions as ‘Bull,’ ‘bawls,’ ‘walnuts,’ and ‘blimey.’ Ever since the night at the Congo when he heard the ting West Indian girl cry, ‘I’ll slap you bumbole,’ he had always used the word. When his friends asked him what it meant, he grinned and said, ‘Ask the monks’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 130). Jake receives the West Indians’ term “bumbole” through a bilateral cultural exchange within the jazz-addict subculture and experiences an Afro-Caribbean encounter that differs markedly from the postcolonial narrative of Haiti that Ray later imparts. In keeping with his critique of Ray’s book, Jake’s use of “bumbole” suggests a privileging of speech and its historical immediacy  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> over the stagnant written word. Jake embraces the jazz-like improvisational quality of this subcultural speech; indeed, part of the appeal of “bumbole” is its slippery trickster quality. “Bumbole” expresses meaning and yet eludes traditional definition. Even if Jake cannot precisely define it, he can still inhabit its stylistic value, its diasporic space, and its queer undertones. As this linguistically-rich scene suggests, the jazz-addict vernacular expressed style and perpetually evolved alongside the myriad of cultural intersections occurring in cabarets and speakeasies. In using this vernacular, Van Vechten and McKay indicate that the jazz and drug subcultures were more than cohabitants of the same “elsewhere”; rather, they fused together into a cohesive subculture.
	      </p>
<p>
		Between 1928 and 1938, the linguistics journal <span style="font-style:italic;">American Speech</span> published a series of articles that studied and attempted to decipher the language patterns used by jazz and drug subcultures. Articles including “The Language of Drug Addicts,” “Volstead English,” “Jazz Jargon,” and “The Argot of the Underworld Narcotic Addict” discussed how these subcultures deployed idiosyncratic slang, lingo, and subterranean vocabularies and observed how the subcultures’ vernacular connected to behavioral customs, social mores, and political attitudes.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Collectively, these articles assembled an enormous list of words, phrases, and definitions, creating a dictionary of the jazz-addict subculture.
	      </p>
<p>
		The vernacular stylings of Van Vechten and McKay made the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">American Speech</span> in Nathan Van Patten’s 1931 article, “The Vocabulary of the American Negro as Set Forth in Contemporary Literature.” Along with Eric Walrond’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Tropic Death</span>  and R. Emmet Kennedy’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Gritny People</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> were the basis of Van Patten’s study of black linguistic expression. In the article, Van Patten sets the novels against “hundreds of novels and countless short stories . . . written by authors with no first-hand knowledge of how a Negro speaks and without either a desire to present a correct record or any realization of why such a presentation is desirable.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> For Van Patten, the novels deliver authentic representations of speech that stand in stark contrast to a legacy of racial misrepresentation stretching from minstrel shows to “Amos an’ Andy.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> He places special emphasis on the fact that even though Van Vechten and McKay were not African-American, living in and around Harlem supplied them with ample and authentic cross-cultural experiences.
	      </p>
<p>
		Like the other <span style="font-style:italic;">American Speech</span> articles, Van Patten’s compiles a glossary of terms and phrases, but it also addresses the innovative character embedded in this language. Emphasizing complexity, intricacy, and variation, Van Patten outlines eight etymological categories under which the listed words fall, including mispronounced English words, words of French, Spanish, or African origin, hybrid creations, and obsolete English words surviving through black vernacular. While Van Patten says little about the novels’ content, he illumines key historical and cultural topics by selecting, codifying, and then translating the vernacular words into standard English. For example, in addition to using terms like “high yaller,” “ofay,” “blue,” “buckra,” “pink,” “punkin seed,” and “potato-yellow” to describe the complex register of people’s skin tones, both Van Vechten and McKay show how this vernacular describes a range of identity categories, social activities, and commodities central to the jazz-addict subculture. “Pink-chasers”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and “jig-chasers” signify interracial social and sexual lifestyles, in that pink-chasers name African-Americans seeking white company, and jig-chasers name the opposite circumstance. A pimp can be called a “P-I” or an “Eastman,” and cocaine is better known as “happy dust” or “snow.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Van Patten’s concentration on the range of word origins and the complexity and convolution of word usage in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> calls to mind Gates’s exploration of black vernacular as a literary-critical principle. To recall <span style="font-style:italic;">The Signifying Monkey</span> briefly, the crux of Gates’s analysis is the differentiation between Signification (black vernacular) and signification (standard English); the correlative terms Signifyin(g) and signifying represent the black vernacular expression of identity through a linguistic repetition with a difference.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Like Van Patten, Gates highlights playful mutability, arbitrary and strategic substitutions of signifiers, and “the obscuring of apparent meaning” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 53). As a vernacular base for new jazz and addiction vocabularies, Signifyin(g) offered this subculture an audible discourse of refusal and Otherness that complemented its styles, behaviors, and attitudes. In the tradition of Signifyin(g), the jazz-addict vernacular manifested a malleable linguistic code that could both accommodate and reflect the complex political struggles and aesthetic innovations emerging in Harlem’s interzones.
	      </p>
<p>
		Insofar as politics translate into linguistic expression, Gates writes that, “By an act of will, some historically nameless community of remarkably self-conscious speakers of English defined their ontological status as one of profound difference vis-à-vis the rest of society. What’s more, they undertook this act of self-definition, implicit in a (re)naming ritual, within the process of signification that the English language had inscribed for itself” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 47). Therefore, participation in the Signifyin(g) tradition establishes individual membership within the larger community and simultaneously allows the individual to continually rearticulate that community through revision, play, and repetition.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Hebdige describes something similar: “The struggle between different discourses, different definitions and meanings within ideology is therefore always at the same time, a struggle within signification: a struggle for possession of the sign” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 17). For the jazz-addict subculture, a distinct vernacular in the Signifyin(g) tradition enables self-actualization through language, while also challenging the signifying machine of white capitalist or Talented Tenth hegemonies.
	      </p>
<p>
		On a basic level, Signifyin(g) offers a relevant, theoretical descriptor of the interplay between the jazz-addict subculture’s political identity and linguistic expression. On a more advanced level, the <span style="font-style:italic;">American Speech</span> articles, the novels at hand, and Gates’s own study suggest that the formation of the jazz-addict subculture holds an important place in the history of Signifyin(g). For one thing, Gates openly acknowledges that the underlying properties of Signifyin(g) speech acts flourish in the musical patterns, individual improvisations, and general ethos of jazz.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> For Gates, the Signifyin(g) practices that abound in blues and jazz follow a long tradition of black vernacular and African mythology. As historian David T. Courtwright reveals, addiction too has a subcultural, Signifyin(g) legacy. In his history of U.S. opium addiction, Courtwright notes that,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		  Addict subcultures date back at least as far as the mid-nineteenth century . . . . There were separate, sometimes overlapping subcultures of Chinese and white opium smokers in the nineteenth century; subcultures in the sense that each of these groups had its own terminology, procedures, loyalties, and common standards of appropriate behavior. It is interesting in this context to note that many of the terms still in use today (<span style="font-style:italic;">yen, dope fiend, hophead</span>) derive from these prototypical nonmedical addict subcultures.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		In a sense, then, the jazz-addict subculture marks the conjunction of two Signifyin(g) histories, each with an allegiance to communicating through and experimenting with difference.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Indicative of this convergence, Gates borrows a definition of Signifyin(g) from jazz musician Milton “Mezz” Mezzrow’s autobiography, <span style="font-style:italic;">Really the Blues</span> . Gates writes that “Signifyin(g) for Mezzrow is not what is played or said; it is rather a form of rhetorical training” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 70). Though Gates calls Mezzrow a “commentator” on black vernacular, he never deals with the fact that Mezzrow is not African-American. In his autobiography, Mezzrow, a Jewish Chicagoan, recounts how jazz appealed to his quest for self-expression. The aesthetic and cultural refusal of Jim Crow racism by African-American jazz culture resonated with his own confrontations with anti-Semitism. As Mezzrow puts it, “I was maneuvering for a new language that would make me shout out loud and romp on to glory. What I needed was the vocabulary.” He adds, “I not only loved those colored boys, but I was one of them—I felt closer to them than I felt to the whites, and I even got the same treatment . . . . They were my kind of people. And I was going to learn their music and play it for the rest of my days. I was going to be a musician, a Negro musician, hipping the world about the blues the way only Negroes can.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Confirming his education in jazz and Signifyin(g), Mezzrow writes in a black vernacular similar to that used by Van Vechten and McKay; like Van Vechten, he includes a glossary of jazz vernacular, and, along with a translation, he composes an entire section in jive.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Despite the historically complex and often inharmonious quality of Jewish American and African American cross-racial identification, Mezzrow’s place in Gates’s study suggests that the black vernacular tradition can be made multiracial under the right conditions. Moreover, Mezzrow’s inclusion in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Signifying Monkey</span> puts the jazz-addict subculture squarely within this tradition. Along with chronicling the Prohibition-era jazz scenes in Chicago and New York, <span style="font-style:italic;">Really the Blues</span> offers some of the most zealous passages of drug use in American literature. Even Mezzrow’s own name participates in the playful cycles of Signifyin(g) used by the jazz-addict subculture. His nickname Mezz is said to be slang for premium marijuana and riffs on another marijuana reference derived from his surname: Mezzroll or Messerole, which refers to “fat sticks of marihuana, hand-rolled, with the ends tucked in.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> It seems that what Gates calls the “classic confrontation between Afro-American culture and American culture” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 45), which he emphasizes linguistically through his Signification-signification distinctions, loses some consistency and accuracy within the jazz-addict subculture. Like Mezzrow, Van Vechten and McKay account for their participation in bilateral, multiracial exchanges of language and cultural practice, and then create literary characters  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> who engage in similar experiences. Indeed, Van Patten’s taxonomy of words used by Van Vechten and McKay implies that Signifyin(g) is always already produced through bilateral, perhaps multidimensional, cultural exchange, precisely what thrived within the jazz-addict subculture.
	      </p>
<p>
		Though the jazz-addict vernacular is clearly tethered to the very cultural and political issues that have occasioned a critical recuperation of these two novels, it has nonetheless remained a major sticking point for certain critics who seem compelled to qualify their work by making disclaimers about exploitation and racial stereotyping. Of particular concern is Van Vechten’s “Glossary of Negro Words and Phrases.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> While the glossary supports Van Patten’s case for the novel’s authenticity, it also fosters an insider-outsider dynamic by presenting readers not hip to the Harlem community with a brief guidebook. David Levering Lewis reports that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> “drove much of literate Afro-America into a dichotomy of approval and apoplexy over ‘authentic’ versus ‘proper’ cultural expression.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> For Justin D. Edwards, the glossary may indicate a desire to represent Harlem life accurately, but it ultimately still reiterates Van Vechten’s biographical role as a Harlem cultural authority and tour guide for his multiracial group of friends.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Edwards argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> therefore emulates travel writing and fosters a problematic readerly “tourism,” but Edwards wavers in his analysis: “While <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> exploits Harlem’s speakeasies and nightclubs for its literary material, it is also the first American novel by a white writer to attempt representations of black middle-class characters.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Even though Edwards weighs the glossary’s premise against literary caricature, he cannot finally accept the novel as anything other than exploitative or derogatory. He concludes, “By choosing to use . . . textual devices associated with the genre of the travel narrative, Van Vechten is unable to avoid the discursive strategies of eroticisation, voyeurism and taxonomy—all of which contradict his claims of authenticity in favour of contemporary stereotypes.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Echoing Edwards’s negative reading, Kathleen Pfeiffer also has difficulty reconciling the glossary’s contribution with the novel’s seedy or racy passages. In her introduction to the reissue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, she asserts that sensationalism and the glossary are both part of Van Vechten’s strategy to attract black and white readers. Pfeiffer even hints at Gates’s work when she argues that,
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  What the glossary accomplishes . . . is more in keeping with the African American trickster tradition than any scholarly tradition. This is best illustrated in the twinned entries ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">boody</span>: see hootchie-pap’ and ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">hootchie-pap</span>: see boody’ . . . . The glossary points in sum to the larger project of the novel itself—to offer a glimpse into the contours of black culture, but to obscure and thereby protect the integrity of that culture’s meaning.
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, xxviii)

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Like Edwards and Van Patten, Pfeiffer suggests that this glossary verifies Van Vechten’s legitimate knowledge of, and participation in, Harlem’s New Negro community. However, she sees that community rather conservatively; when addressing the novel’s salacious content, she insists that the cabaret scenes and those involving the Scarlet Creeper are “peripheral scenes” that “move quickly” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, xxvi). Eventually countering Edwards’s conclusions, she defends the novel against charges of racist exploitation,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> but only by minimizing the content of these passages.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Essentially, Pfeiffer excises the black vernacular of the novel from the cultural contexts in which it thrives, severing Harlem’s nightlife and black vernacular from the middle-class main characters. She assures that, “<span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> actually spends only thirty-nine of its 284 pages depicting raunchy or debauched aspects of Harlem life” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, xv). Aside from her argument’s problematic quality-versus-quantity approach, Pfeiffer simply sweeps the jazz-addict subculture under the rug.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  As Jake’s attraction to the word “bumbole” demonstrates, the jazz-addict vernacular matters even outside “raunchy” and “debauched” scenes; it signals the complex identity politics affecting the entire New Negro community. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, Byron’s class and cultural membership involves a daily competition for signification. His lack of knowledge about black vernacular severely compromises his ability to secure work or jumpstart his writing career. Paradoxically, he is denied entry into the white business world for which his University of Pennsylvania education has trained him, and his own stubborn refusal to accept help from established New Negro businessmen relegates him to lower-class employment. As if imitating Paul Laurence Dunbar, Byron hopes that his job operating elevators, however disagreeable, will at least provide writing material:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    Nevertheless, his immediate pendent thought was that he would never write about this life, that he could never feel anything but repugnance for these people because they were black. I can’t bear to think of myself as a part of this, he sighed . . . . Well, presently he knew what <span style="font-style:italic;">they</span> thought . . . . He caught phrases: posin’ an’ signifyin’, high-toned mustardseed, arnchy yaller boy, sheik from Strivers’ Row.
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 192)
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    Already excluded from the business world because of his race, Byron realizes that his coworkers have judged him an outsider because of his education and class. Later, his friend Howard apologizes and says, “I forgot to warn you . . . . You ought to speak in dialect . . . . You have to be a mixer” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 194). As Howard suggests, Byron’s situation is clearly a crisis of passing, one in which black must now pass for black.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Byron’s inability to learn, speak, and write the jazz-addict vernacular ironically undercuts his attempts to become the New Negro aesthete. His short story about an interracial cabaret romance is rejected for publication because the magazine editor finds it too prudish and lacking authenticity. The editor tells Byron, “Jean Cocteau could have done a cabaret better without ever having heard of such a dive. Your scene reads like a description of a Baptist sociable for the new minister” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 225) and advises, “Go home now, tear up everything you’ve written, and begin afresh. Pray and get drunk” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 227). For Byron, this suggestion highlights the failure not only of his writing, but also the failure of his authorship of self. Near the novel’s end, Byron gets drunk on gin in the Black Venus and declares his dual resentment of New Negro ambitions and the jazz-addict subculture: “A meaningless jumble. Like life. Like Negro life. Kicked down from above. Pulled down from below. No cheer but dance drink and happy dust” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 278). Unable to negotiate his place, either in language or style, Byron falls tragically into a cultural void.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“Artificial Paradises”: Coleridge and Baudelaire in Harlem</h1>
<p>
		    By representing the jazz-addict subculture’s Signifiyin(g) speech practices and the affirmation of its underground space through language, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> exemplify what Gates calls “speakerly texts.” These two “double-voiced” novels also capture the “elsewhere” aura of the jazz-addict subculture by performing “tropological revision” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, xxv).<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In particular, both novels create intertextual relationships by repeating and reworking the tropes of nineteenth-century European drug literature. Van Vechten and McKay mobilize signature Orientalist metaphors and motifs from authors such as De Quincey, Coleridge, and Baudelaire in attempts to capture the various states of intoxication experienced by their characters.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> However, more than simply hijacking opium narratives and adopting Orientalism wholesale in order to describe the jazz-addict subculture, these two novels portray an Orientalism with a black difference, or what Bill Mullen terms “Afro-Orientalism.” While the “speakerly” aspects of these novels convey a vocalized “elsewhere,” the Afro-Orientalist tropological revisions suggest an additional “elsewhere” inhabited and experimented with by the jazz-addict subculture.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Through a kind of tropological revision of its own—a rethinking of Said’s Orientalism, in particular—Mullen’s Afro-Orientalism denotes both an historical African-American fantasy of escape from the black-white binary of American racism and also “a speculative bridge” that understands African and Asian diasporas as proximate, synchronous experiences produced along the pathways of Western imperialism, slavery and indentured servitude, and institutionalized global racism.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> As presented by Van Vechten and McKay, the Afro-Orientalism of the jazz-addict subculture offers participants an alternative political and cultural reality. Like the subcultural “elsewhere,” this Afro- Orientalism offers “an imaginary ‘third way’ out of the crushing oppositional hierarchies of the American South’s peculiarly brutal history. Asia’s distance in this parable is its utopian attraction, far removed, literally and ratively, from the sphere of Western power.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> By describing scenes of intoxication and racial fantasy through allusions to Coleridge and Baudelaire, Van Vechten and McKay reconre the Western Orientalist typology. This act of Signifyin(g) breaks down and reassembles African primitivism and Orientalist exoticism in order to create a new, Afro-Orientalist voice of cultural expression, dissent, and escape.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Before dealing with the Afro-Orientalism that colors the characters’ behaviors, remarks, and impressions of intoxication and partying, it is first worth mentioning that in both novels Harlem is itself Orientalized. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, cabarets and eateries have names like the Nile Restaurant and the Sheba Palace, where the crowd “was a scene of blazing color. Soft, barbaric, burning, savage, clashing, planless colors—all rioting together in wonderful harmony” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 320). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, Harlem is repeatedly called “the Mecca of the New Negro.” Indeed, the Harlem hotspots in both novels closely resemble the favorite establishments—the Lybia, the Oriental, and the Garden of Joy—that Rudolph Fisher recollects in his essay “The Caucasian Storms Harlem.” The novels present what Fisher once witnessed, a Harlem still African-American, but  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in the form of essentialist apparitions of African origin. As Erenberg explains, there was both “the sense that New York was not America” and the feeling that it was “the pagan center of the nation.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Like the miniature Orients of London’s East End opium dens, the Congo, a blacks-only cabaret in <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, “was a real throbbing little Africa in New York” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 29). This “Africanness” distinguishes the Congo from a Jewish-owned cabaret that caters to largely interracial crowds: “The Congo was African in spirit and color. No white persons were admitted there . . . . When you were fed up with the veneer of Seventh Avenue, and Goldgraben’s Afro-Oriental garishness, you would go to the Congo and turn rioting loose in all the tenacious odors of service and the warm indigenous smells of Harlem, fooping or jig-jagging the night away” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 30). Here McKay reveals a scale of Afro-Orientalist possibility: one plays with the fantasy of escape at Goldgraben’s, but one realizes that escape at the Congo.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>
		    Such nightspots provide a subcultural locale for experimenting with the Afro-Orientalist imagination. According to Mullen, Afro-Orientalism within the broader African-American community took shape through cultural and political expressions of Afrocentrism, Egyptocentrism, and Ethiopianism, which sought to resuscitate a mythology of past African greatness and reimagine Africa as a tangible utopian destination. In both novels, jazz and intoxication offer a spiritual portal for making this mythological journey. For instance, during a visit to Madame Laura’s brothel in <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, Jake and Ray listen as the piano player “wandered off into some dim, far away, ancestral source of music” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 196). The roomful of couples in carnal knowledge becomes a community through collective fantasy: “Black lovers of life caught up in their own free native rhythm, threaded to a remote scarce-remembered past, celebrating the midnight hours in themselves, for themselves, of themselves” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 197). This combination of jazz and sex transports the intoxicated orgy of Madame Laura’s brothel “back to Africa,” away from the hegemonic constraints and frustrations posed by American racism, capitalism, and New Negro expectations.
		  </p>
<p>
		    At its surface, Afro-Orientalism involves a degree of theatrical caricature, which makes both novels susceptible to the critics who accuse them of racial stereotyping and exploitation. In fact, the Afro-Orientalist flair of a place like Goldgraben’s in <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> certainly plays into the fantasies of white club goers. Mumford suggests that for many slumming whites, “spending a night on the town in Harlem might represent the cultural equivalent of taking a Cunard cruise to Africa, an exciting excursion into another social world” (<span style="font-style:italic;">I</span>, 143).<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> That being said, Afro-Orientalism still contributes to a genuine subcultural style by allowing New Negro participants to experiment with primitivist and exotic parody.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, for example, Mary and Byron enjoy Afro-Orientalized sexual foreplay: “You talk like a savage! I am. I’m an African cannibal! Son of a king! Going to eat you up for my dinner!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 145).
		  </p>
<p>
		    Such role-playing cannot be divorced from the more ostensibly political depths of the Afro-Orientalist imagination. This is especially true for Mary, who assembles an exhibit of authentic African artifacts that is mocked and disparaged by a group of elite New Negro acquaintances: “African sculpture! That dreadful, vulgar stuff! . . . It’s the work of heathen savages . . . and it has nothing to do with art . . . everybody goes back  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to savages, but it does no good to unearth that sort of thing” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 70–71). Here Hester Snodes argues that the African past has no present-day value for the New Negro. On the contrary, Mary deftly wields Afro-Orientalism as a critical lens for viewing her community and her cultural roots. To Mary, the aristocratic Adora resembles Cleopatra, while Orville Snodes has an “empty face, so like an Ethiopian Moon” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 26, 67). Mary’s father, in turn, personifies Othello. She thinks that, “He actually represented her idea of a Moor. Might he not, indeed, be one?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 94). Mary’s tendency to see people in this way triggers a lengthy meditation on the origins of the Negro and Afro-Orientalist diasporas:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      The old slave traders were none too particular concerning the individuals they kidnapped along the African coast . . . . Not only were the miserable human beings raped from all parts of Africa, representatives of widely differing African tribes, but also Arabs, Egyptians, Moors, and even Spaniards and Portuguese were gathered in. In America these curiously distinct races came together and bore children; further these children were often impregnated with French, Spanish, English and Indian blood. The result, whatever the percentage of the mixture, was known in this enlightened country as a Negro.
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 94)
		    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      For Mary in particular, and throughout both novels in general, Afro-Orientalism becomes a paradigm of subjective self-reflection and a sign of concern about what is at stake in pursuing a New Negro identity which ignores or rejects the historical past. Afro-Orientalism also acts as a conduit through which Van Vechten and McKay critique the modernist high culture/low culture posturing endorsed by elitist New Negroes like Van Vechten’s Hester Snodes. To be precise, the scenes of greatest decadence and lowest debauchery receive, through tropological revisions of Coleridgean and Baudelairean motifs, some of the most highly stylized treatments in the novels. By taking from high culture the narcotic reveries of European romanticism and then conjoining them to the low culture of the jazz-addict vernacular, Van Vechten and McKay both compose a politically and aesthetically syncretic subcultural riposte to the Talented Tenth.
		    </p>
<p>
		      In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, Byron and Lasca speed toward the novel’s ultimate indulgences and vice by drinking heavily, snorting cocaine in the back of a taxicab, and giving the order, “Drive to hell!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 252). Their destination, the Black Mass, is a secretive, underground cabaret where Kubla Khan’s pleasure-dome hides in the bowels of Harlem.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> When the compliant if not naïve Byron asks Lasca about the club, she explains that, “It’s a garden where champagne flows from all the fountains and the paths are made of happy dust and the perfume of the poppies is opium” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 252). In contrast to this drug-laced paradisal advertisement, Byron observes “tortured music from the depths of hell,” “demoniac saxophones,” a “witches’ sabbath,” and “pleasure seekers from the cold slabs of the morgue” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 254). In a startling display of sexualized exoticism, a young girl, “pure black with savage African features,” removes her black cloak, dances naked, and performs “her evil rites” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 255–56). Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan” hinges on a similar antagonism between a hedonistic Orientalized garden and a satanic, feminine danger: “A savage place! as holy and enchanted / As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted / By woman wailing for her demon-lover! / And from this chasm, with ceaseless  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> turmoil seething, / As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, / A mighty fountain momently was forced.” Under Lasca’s influence and intoxicated with liquor and cocaine, Byron hears “that music loud and long” and becomes the poetic witness to Kubla Khan’s “sunny dome” and “caves of ice.” The Black Mass scene seems to cry “Beware! Beware!” as it sends Byron to his ignoble fate; “For he on honey-dew hath fed / And drunk the milk of Paradise.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>
		      During the lengthy tryst that follows, Lasca becomes the corporeal source of Byron’s moral turpitude, his pleasure and his pain. Her name appears to be derived from “Lascar,” an archaism for an East Indian sailor. And like the Black Mass, her home is an Orientalist pleasure dome: “Over the Steinway, a black Spanish shawl, embroidered in huge vermilion and orange flowers, was held in place by a rock-crystal lamp in the form of a Chinese goddess. Strewn on the tables, the desk, the mantelpiece, were more Chinese objects, birds, fish and animals” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 237). Byron and Lasca continue their torrent of excess for days, drinking absinthe, having violent confrontations leading to sex, and enjoying other indescribable indulgences: “There were rages, succeeded by tumultuous passions; there were peaceful interludes; there were hours devoted to satisfying capricious desires, rhythmical amours to music, cruel and painful pastimes; there were the artificial paradises” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 261). The allusion to Baudelaire’s treatise on hashish and opium, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Paradis Artificiels</span> , further invokes the tradition of Orientalist drug literature.
		    </p>
<p>
		      As an allusion to Baudelaire, this passage also cements Byron’s catastrophic collapse. Baudelaire’s stories of hashish and opium are impassioned admonitions, not romanticized celebrations; the exotic and Oriental is as dangerous as it is alluring. In a warning that resonates with Coleridge’s “Kubla Kahn” and the Satanic aura of the Black Mass, Baudelaire writes that, “These stimulant poisons are not only one of the most direct and terrible means employed by the Prince of Darkness to entrap and enslave deplorable humanity, they are also among his most perfect embodiments.”<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> To Byron, who is already known to be a “slave to [his] appetites,” Lasca presents an even greater threat (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 171). As Baudelaire suggests, “A man in such a situation never believes he is selling his soul. In his infatuation, he forgets that he is playing with a being subtler than himself, and that if the Spirit of Evil is allowed to grasp but a single hair, it will lose no time in carrying off the entire head.”<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Once Lasca uses Byron up and throws him out, the novel fulfills Baudelaire’s predicted ignominy and becomes, like Coleridge’s fragmentary vision, an irretrievable hallucinogenic dream ending with Byron exhausted, empty, and mortified.

<p>
		      In <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, tropological revisions of Coleridge and Afro-Orientalist wonderment surface during Jake’s interactions with Ray. For Jake, Ray embodies a desirable and perhaps queer Otherness; he represents the independent black nationalism of Haiti, speaks French, reads poetry, and attends college. During a stopover in Pennsylvania, Ray entrances Jake with a Wordsworth poem about Toussaint L’Ouverture and introduces him to a new Afro-Orientalist worldview that triangulates back through Afro-Caribbean postcolonial history. After hearing Ray’s stories about West Africa, Abyssinia, Egypt, Palestine, Ethiopia, the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon, Jake  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> is enthralled: “as an American Negro he looked askew at foreign niggers. Africa was jungle, and Africans bush niggers, cannibals. But now he felt like a boy who stands with the map of the world in colors before him, and feels the wonder of the world” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 134). Like Mary, Jake’s encounter with the Afro-Orientalist imagination, by way of the Black Atlantic, manifests a self-reflective consideration of his place in the African-American community. Indeed, for Michelle Stephens, Ray’s “story of racial solidarity is a transnational one because it pulls Jake out of his own nationality, both as an American and as a Harlemite, and into a more internationalist imagining of racial home and his own black masculinity.”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>
		      Though Ray appears already fluent in the academic aspects of the Afro-Orientalist imagination, it is not until his fantasies funnel through the jazz-addict subculture that his own crisis of identity and community is fully revealed. In the chapter “Snowstorm in Pittsburgh,” McKay’s Signifyin(g) play-on-words in the title setting up the chapter’s cocaine episodes, Jake and Ray discover a jazz-addict subculture in Pittsburgh and receive an invitation to share some cocaine with a few of the speakeasy patrons. Jake and Ray’s unnamed companion describes Happy, the man who invited them: “He’s the biggest hophead I ever seen. Nobody can sniff like him. Yet he’s always the same happy nigger, stout and strong like a bull” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 149). While Ray calmly declines, Jake accepts the invitation, and his familiarity with cocaine is revealed: “Jake looked mischievously at the little brown door, remarking: ‘It’s a great life ef youse in on it . . . ’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 149). As if entering into another world, Jake passes through the mysterious brown door and enters a room of opium smoking and cocaine snorting. Inside, Happy says, “‘Say what you wanta about Chinee or any other stuff . . . but theah ain’t nothing can work wicked like snow and whisky. It’ll flip you up from hell into heaven befoh you knows it’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 150). Happy’s remarks suggest a spiritual upward mobility via intoxication and also acknowledge a carefully negotiated exchange between African-Americans and Asian-Americans made possible by a shared affinity for these drugs. Here, the opium den subcultures discussed by Milligan and Courtwright rematerialize within an African-American subcultural space.
		    </p>
<p>
		      For Jake, this drug experience is a casual and mundane affair, hardly an Afro-Orientalist phenomenon. After partaking, he buys a few packets of cocaine from Happy and leaves. However, for Ray, who finds and uses Jake’s cocaine, his drug experience collides with his already intense cultural and political anxieties. Restlessly dreaming about a return to Haiti and thinking about his railroad job as slave labor, Ray naïvely hopes that the cocaine will be soporific. For Ray, the cocaine seems to be a way out of the unnatural world of American capitalism, “that magnificent monster of civilization” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 155). Mirroring the fantastical awe he earlier sparked in Jake, Ray’s druginduced dreams transport him to a Coleridgean world of exotic pleasures, luxuries, and possibilities:
		    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			And the world was a blue paradise. Everything was in gorgeous blue of heaven. Woods and streams were blue, and men and women and animals, and beautiful to see and love. And he was a blue bird in flight and a blue lizard in love . . . . Taboos and terrors and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> penalities were transformed into new pagan delights, orgies of Orient-blue carnival, or rare flowers and red fruits, cherubs and seraphs and fetishes and phalli and all the mosthigh gods.
		      </p>
<div class="attrib">
			(<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 158)<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			  “Here,” according to Stephens’s reading of Ray’s dream, “the black male subject flies away from even his Caribbean nation-home to a multicultural premodern dreamscape in which he can actualize in himself the re of the black, male, sovereign self.”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> This dream liberates Ray’s imagination from the stultifying limits of diasporic life, thereby enabling his desire for political and sexual sovereignty to reach its most radical and uncompromised expression. And yet, as in Coleridge’s poem and Byron’s escapade with Lasca, Ray’s escape into an Afro-Orientalist paradise shuts down abruptly. Utopian pleasures turn painful as “a thousand pins were pricking Ray’s flesh” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 158). When Ray is found the next day, having overdosed, he must be taken to the hospital.
			</p>
<p>
			  Though Jake realizes what had happened, the railroad chef misinterprets Ray’s condition and instead blames the illness on Ray’s scholarly pursuits: “Better leave that theah nigger professor alone and come on ’long to the dining-car with us. That theah nigger is dopey from them books o’ hisn. I done told befoh them books would git him yet” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 159). The chef’s belief that one can overdose on books calls attention to the conflicted attitudes toward education and high culture within the New Negro community.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> The chef implies that Ray’s cultural capital promotes a false, if not dangerous, sense of superiority over the rest of the working-class New Negroes. But at the same time, the distinction between high culture and low culture collapses. The slippage between Ray overdosing on drugs and overdosing on literature underscores Ray’s own inner conflicts about the redeemable value of his education. The cocaine puts Ray in touch with an Afro-Orientalist variation on the escapist fantasies already integral to his engagement with literature and culture. Well after the cocaine episode, Ray contemplates an Afrocentric “third way out”: “I don’t know what I’ll do with my little education. I wonder sometimes if I could get rid of it and go and lose myself in some savage culture in the jungles of Africa” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 274). Like Byron, Ray cannot find a stable home within the jazz-addict subculture; nor can he find a gratifying pursuit that justifies his education. Ultimately, both characters’ engagements with the jazz-addict subculture are profound not because their desires come to be satisfied, but because their desires come to be expressed and experimented with in ways that are unavailable elsewhere. In this sense, the jazz-addict subculture manifests a community of desire that seeks alternative pathways to racial, sexual, and economic self-understanding—pathways which are actively obstructed by the expectations of white culture and the Talented Tenth.

			  Like Ellison’s invisible man, whom Dr. Bledsoe punished for giving the college’s white trustee the “complete tour” and “the full treatment,” Van Vechten and McKay have been widely criticized for exploring the gritty and scandalous underside of the Harlem Renaissance.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> But as the denouncements of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> subside, it is important to reconsider the political and aesthetic legacy of the Harlem underground. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Harlem Renaissance in Black and White</span>, George Hutchinson  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> contends that, “New York provided a freer atmosphere for the black artist both because of the concentration, dynamism, and diversity of racial consciousness in Harlem <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> because of the greater freedom and variety of <span style="font-style:italic;">inter</span>racial and <span style="font-style:italic;">inter</span>ethnic relationships, which only intensified the experimental development of new forms of ‘racial’ expression.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> Van Vechten and McKay find such expressive forms in the language and style of the jazz-addict subculture, and thus, they showcase these forms in their representations of Harlem life. From within an intoxicated, jazzing world of bilateral cultural exchange, the jazz-addict subculture expressed “a fundamental tension between those in power and those condemned to subordinate positions and second-class lives” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 132). Through their examinations of the Afro-Orientalist imagination and their mobilization of the jazz-addict vernacular, Van Vechten and McKay show how the jazz-addict subculture responded materially and aesthetically to class hypocrisies, racial disenfranchisement, and Progressive-era hegemonies affecting the entire Harlem community.

			  By using the term jazz-addict subculture, I do not mean to conflate drug use with addiction. Rather, I use addiction here to represent the conservative Progressive-era attitudes toward drug use and alcohol consumption. The Harrison Act of 1914 along with Prohibition affirmed a legal and cultural consensus that the slippery slope between casual use and addiction presented too great a social threat to allow narcotics and alcohol to go unregulated any longer. Six years before Prohibition, the Harrison Act established Internal Revenue Service taxation policies to control the distribution of opiates and cocaine. The Harrison Act made it “unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs” without IRS approval. Quoted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Drugs in America: A Documentary History</span>, David F. Musto, ed. (New York: New York University Press, 2002), 254. Unlike Prohibition, which targeted manufacture in addition to sales and distribution, the Harrison Act expressly sought to prevent drugs from entering society by illicit means.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

			In “Story in Harlem Slang” , Zora Neale Hurston employs a similar black vernacular and like Van Vechten includes a glossary. Hurston’s story demonstrates how this vernacular arms the two male gigolo characters with the power to simultaneously differentiate identities culturally and socio-economically: “Man, I don’t deal in no coal. Know what I tell ’em? If they’s white, they’s right! If they’s yellow, they’s mellow! If they’s brown, they can stick around. But if they come black, they better git way back! Tell ’em about me!” Zora Neale Hurston, “Story in Harlem Slang,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Zora Neale Hurston: Novels and Stories</span>, ed. Cheryl A. Wall (New York: Library of America, 1995), 1004.

			Edwards, “Carl Van Vechten,” 182. On the problem of authenticity and choice in the two novels, Nathan Huggins writes that “McKay’s novel is far more evocative than Van Vechten’s. The fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> was written from the ‘inside’ is apparent from its confusion. Van Vechten’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> novel described life that the author had observed as a chosen part of his experience. McKay, on the other hand, wrote about his own context and his own frustration.” Nathan Irvin Huggins, <span style="font-style:italic;">Harlem Renaissance</span> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971), 124.

		      When Edwards calls the novel a failure, he argues almost the opposite position with regards to cabarets and the Scarlet Creeper: “The text fails in part because the most significant scenes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> are those containing the Scarlet Creeper and Lasca Sartoris. Unfortunately, the sections of the novel which focus on the middle-class lifestyles of Mary Love, Byron Kasson, Olive Hamilton, and Howard Allison fail because they seem trite, banal and over determined.” Edwards, “Carl Van Vechten,” 180.

		      Bill V. Mullen, <span style="font-style:italic;">Afro-Orientalism</span> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), xli. Mullen makes fairly clear the tropological revision suggested here: “Afro-Orientalism is a counterdiscourse that at times shares with its dominant namesake certain features but primarily constitutes an independent critical trajectory of thought on the practice and ideological weight of Orientalism in the Western world. Afro-Orientalism, in other words, is a signifying discourse on race, nation, and global politics constituting a subtradition in indigenous U.S. writing on imperialism, colonialism, and the making of capitalist empire” (xv).

		      Aside from reveling in nostalgia, one of the main concerns of Fisher’s essay is the phenomenon of authentic, if not blacks-only, venues giving way to Jewish and other ownership seeking the patronage of the white slumming crowd.

		      Byron and Lasca gain entrance into the Black Mass only after passing through three separate doors vis-à-vis a ritual of button pushing, door knocking, and an inspection from an attendant behind a sliding door panel (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 253–54). For Erenberg, this type of descent announces a cultural fissure: “During the 1920s the nightclub entered the speakeasy phase of its existence, one associated with secret passwords and criminal suppliers of alcohol. The illegal aura surrounding its operations best expresses the removal of the cabaret from public life and the disjuncture between public and private values” (Erenberg, “From New York,” 763). In one sense, Byron ends up a tragic victim whose inability to reconcile the conflicting demands of public and private (manifested in his struggles with race, class, and labor), leads to impotent disgrace.
