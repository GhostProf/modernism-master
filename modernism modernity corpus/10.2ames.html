A Report to the Academy
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
"What is to be gained, someone will surely ask, by having a Hottentot sing
into the phonograph, then taking this dubious work of art and dissecting
it with a tonometer and a metronome into its atomic parts?"<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  In his 1905 address "The Problems of Comparative Musicology," presented
  to the International Society for Musicology in Vienna, Erich Moritz
  von Hornbostel reframed what was already an old question in strikingly
  new terms. By the turn of the century, the Western fascination with
  non-Western music had an extensive history, documented in numerous
  accounts by travelers, missionaries, merchants, and scientists.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  These written accounts remind us that the unexpected component of
  Hornbostel's experiment was not the Hottentot, but the phonograph. The
  study of music had previously relied on source criticism, texts
  including hand-written scores and published manuscripts, whereas
  comparative musicology&#8212;a precursor to ethnomusicology&#8212;would
  become the first discipline based on sound recordings.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  Though Edison's "talking machine" commonly denoted pleasure,
  leisure, entertainment, and consumption, this device would now
  serve to establish the empirical basis for a comparative science of
  music. Thus the phonograph lured a new generation of scientists to
  revisit a familiar topos, the "primitive," embodied by the Hottentot.

<p>
Hornbostel phrased his question as a joke for an audience presumably
familiar with the re of Saartjie Baartman, a San woman who was
exhibited in the early nineteenth century as the "Hottentot Venus." Her
stage name itself was intended ironically, for, as Bernth Lindfors
explains, "in physique she little resembled

<b></b>

any European notion of classic beauty. Like many San women, she had
steatopygia, a greatly enlarged rump, which appears to have been the
single feature of her anatomy sensational enough to bring out crowds
to see her."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Spectators in London, where Baartman was displayed from 1810 to
  1811, described her performance as a kind of animal act, invoking
  and thereby reinforcing the idea of a biological continuum between
  humans and animals that organized her stage performance.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  The French naturalist Georges Cuvier conferred scientific authority
  upon this idea by comparing Baartman's physique to that of an
  orangutan. In this instance, as Sander Gilman has shown, what was
  deemed extraordinary corporeality implied racial and sexual degeneracy.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  When Baartman died in 1815, her body parts were dissected, dipped in
  wax, and exhibited at the Mus&eacute;e de l'Homme in Paris. From the
  London stage to the Paris museum, the Hottentot Venus confirms that
  human displays occupied a tenuous space between the embodied and the
  disembodied, the living and the dead.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
Hornbostel proposed a new approach to this re, one that simultaneously
inverted certain conventions of her stage performance and elaborated
the logic of anatomical display. Rather than exhibit the Hottentot's
physicality, he recorded her music, preserved it in wax, and dissected
her song into its minutest parts. The phonograph offered a means of
hearing, examining, and representing the primitive in a new mode of
disembodiment, as a sound recording. Moreover, its capacity to inscribe
sound in a permanent and reproducible form&#8212;a wax cylinder or
phonogram&#8212;granted access to an acoustic realm that had previously
resisted perception.

<p>
This attempt to explore the imperceptible world by mechanical means was
one of many in the late nineteenth century. The French physiologist
&Eacute;tienne-Jules Marey had already used a battery of graphic,
photographic, and cinematographic devices for reproducing what the eye
could not see, recording the instantaneous movements of physical functions
such as muscle contractions, and analyzing their changes over time.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  Hornbostel distinguished his project from Marey's in two important
  ways: first, by his use of sound technology, and second, by his preoccupation
with the so-called primitive. This second point of distinction also led
Hornbostel, unlike Marey, to plot temporal change along an evolutionary
axis, charting the morphological and historical transformations of
music across the sweep of time and space. Even while scrutinizing
the tiniest fractions of a moment, as had Marey, Hornbostel imagined
himself traversing extended intervals of time: "We wish to uncover
the darkest and most distant past, to peel off the timeless and the
elemental from the fullness of the present; in other words, we want to
understand the evolution and the aesthetic foundation of music" ("PM,"
56). This programmatic statement inadvertently evokes the experience
of time at the cusp of the twentieth century&#8212;an experience that
the phonograph and the cinema helped transform. These inventions, as the
historian Stephen Kern has shown, "brought the past into the present more
than ever before," thereby expanding the present and giving it density.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  The thickened present offered Hornbostel a uniquely modern terrain
  for excavating the primitive past, and the phonograph served as
  his requisite tool for digging. By means of recording, he sought to
  extract from the Hottentot's song "the <i>primal</i> origins of music"
  (<i>die</i> Ur<i>anf&auml;nge der Musik</i>).
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
If the Hottentot Venus remains a familiar icon, the sound of her voice
has faded from memory. As modernists, our shared interest in the visual
has led us to overlook the historical impact of a discipline, indeed a
discourse, based on and dedicated to the preservation of sound.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  Yet this phenomenon should be of interest to us, not only because it
  emphasizes the specificity of sound (which reminds us that problems of
  representing evolution are not restricted to vision), but also because
  it raises new questions about the formation of scientific discourse
  in the context of modern technology. This essay investigates the role
  of phonography in the nascent discipline of comparative musicology
  (<i>vergleichende Musikwissenschaft</i>).
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  In particular, it demonstrates how phonography could be imagined
  and employed as a discursive technique for rendering evolution
  audible&#8212;a technique, that is, for dissecting "primitive" songs
  and rebuilding them into evolutionary narratives. Sound technology
  helped transform music into information that could be used and
  distributed in a variety of ways. This essay therefore explores how
  listening becomes a scientific pursuit.

<p>
In examining the initial experiments of Hornbostel and his colleagues,
we access what Bruno Latour calls "science in action," in this case,
the making of ethnomusicology before the "field" even existed.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  We gain too a more nuanced understanding of how scientists
  shape their practice retroactively according to their use of
  new tools and techniques. Comparative musicologists found their
  own voice by experimenting with the phonograph and its popular
  discourse. Phonography helped create the necessary conditions for
  the ascent of comparative musicology, even while broadcasting the
  ostensible decline of that discipline's unique object of study, the
  loss of "original" music. By appropriating and modifying phonography
  for the purpose of conducting experimental research, comparative
  musicology reorganized scientific modes of representation; more
  importantly, though, it spoke on behalf of an entirely new principle
  of not seeing science&#8212;but hearing it. As I argue, Hornbostel
  and his colleagues represented their object of study as well as
  their ideas about it in acoustic terms, as a form of phonographic
  discourse. Today, if not in turn-of-the-century Germany, what was
  once a loud and audible fact threatens to fall on deaf ears. There
  was a moment when the ear had a purchase that the eye did not. As
  modernists, we need to listen to the sound of evolution: that of our
  own. Whether we think of ourselves as living in the information age
  or under the sign of globalization, the problems we confront in using
  new technologies to stake out interdisciplinary areas of scholarship
  are still linked to "the problems of comparative musicology" that
  Hornbostel addressed nearly a century ago.

Institutions of the Audible
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In his Vienna lecture of 1905, Hornbostel spoke as the newly appointed
director of the Berlin Phonogram Archive (das Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv).
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Founded in 1900 by Carl Stumpf, the archive was initially housed
  in the Psychology Institute, which Stumpf directed, at the Berlin
  University. A private institution funded largely by Hornbostel's
  estate and the few donations he and Stumpf could solicit, the phonogram
  archive was the first of its kind in Germany, although not the first
  in the world. In 1899

<b></b>

Sigmund Exner had established the Phonogram Archive of the Austrian
Academy of Sciences (das Phonogrammarchiv der &ouml;sterreichischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften) in Vienna. A scant year later, presumably
in response to its new competition, Exner would assert: "The collection
of musical performances of savage peoples may prove to be especially
fruitful for a comparative musicology, which would probably be made
possible in this way."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  Nevertheless, he set a Eurocentric agenda for the Vienna archive,
  concentrating on European languages and dialects, Western music,
  and on the voices of famous personalities, in that order of priority.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  Thus the Berlin Phonogram Archive made a name for itself by
  specializing in the collection of "exotic melodies" (<i>exotische
  Melodien</i>).

<p>
Stumpf and Hornbostel would later be recognized as the "founding
fathers" of the so-called Berlin School of Comparative Musicology,
but the historiographical emphasis on fathers and schools misses the
point. On one level, it locates Stumpf and his assistants retrospectively
in a disciplinary position that they never occupied. None had chairs in
comparative musicology (or for that matter in musicology). Trained in
philosophy, Stumpf held posts in psychology at W&uuml;rzburg, Prague,
Halle, and Munich, where he specialized in "psychoacoustics," before
landing at the Berlin University. His first full-time assistant in the
phonogram archive, Otto Abraham, was a successful Berlin physician, while
Hornbostel earned his doctorate in chemistry at the University of Vienna.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Each scholar initially worked outside of the boundaries that presumably
  circumscribed comparative musicology. Their peripheral position urges
  us to treat this project as interdisciplinary from the outset. Indeed,
  the question that Hornbostel and his coworkers asked of their object
  was "inextricably tied to the most general questions of musical
  history, ethnography, and psychology; its solution could only be
  approached through the cooperation of these sciences" ("BPM," 225).

<p>
On another level, school-driven approaches to comparative musicology
give short shrift to the sound archive as a "hearing institution" (or
<i>H&ouml;ranstalt</i>), as Hornbostel would call it. Mark Sandberg's
analysis of the folk museum and the cinema as "institutions of the
visible" is here instructive, emphasizing as it does the notion of "the
institution as discursive formation" in order to elicit the historical
as well as the metaphorical links between seemingly disparate visual
attractions.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  An analogous accent on the phonograph and the sound archive as
  "institutions of the audible" not only amplifies their discursive
  cross talk; it also demonstrates how they participated together in
  a larger economy of circulation.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
In 1908, when the Berlin Phonogram Archive had collected nearly one
thousand wax cylinders, Stumpf enumerated the various sources from which
they derived:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
They have come, first, from our own recordings of occasional performances
by exotic guests in the German Imperial capital; second, from recordings
made by traveling researchers, many of whom we equipped with phonographs
and instructions; third, from the exchange of copies with other archives
abroad; and fourth, from donations by the large phonographic companies
(Deutsche Grammophon, Favorit, Beka Records), which produce nearly
flawless recordings in the farthest reaches of the world for commercial
purposes.

<b></b>
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



Each of these sources&#8212;exhibitions, travelers, archives, and record
companies&#8212;represents but one channel in an emerging network of
circulation based on the mobility of recorded sound. Taken together,
they offer a glimpse of the vast infrastructure that Stumpf and his
assistants required for their collection project. "This work is at once
national and international [<i>v&ouml;lkerverkn&uuml;pfend</i>], for it
requires the cooperation of researchers from all civilized nations in
the service of common knowledge."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  By 1918, the archive would amass more than ten thousand recordings,
  making it the world's largest phonogram collection and the hub of
  a global exchange network. As Stumpf proclaimed a decade earlier,
  "If the center of such an undertaking is to exist anywhere in the
  world, then it must be in Berlin" ("BP," 83).

<p>
If the city was the inevitable location for an archive, it was also
the primary site for conducting ethnomusicological fieldwork avant la
lettre. The Berlin Phonogram Archive would rapidly expand its collections
with the rise of professional fieldwork, to be sure. At the turn of the
century, however, "traveling researchers" provided only one among many
sources of acoustic evidence. Generally, Stumpf and his assistants did
not themselves travel abroad. Between 1900 and 1912, they made their
earliest and most important recordings not in the colonies&#8212;but in
the metropolis. The music came to them. Live performances of non-Western
music could be heard throughout Berlin, where they played a key role in
the burgeoning industry of leisure and entertainment as stock features of
cabaret programs, circus shows, and ethnographic exhibitions. Though the
literature on nineteenth-century visual culture maintains an awkward
silence on issues of sound, music did not merely supplement these
entertainments. On the contrary, live performances of foreign music
were in at least one respect more sensational than the visual displays
that they accompanied: Europeans were already familiar with images of
cultural difference, brought to them through paintings and illustrations,
but ethnographic entertainments made the sounds of non-European life
available to mass audiences for the very first time.

<p>
Equipped with a phonograph, Stumpf and his assistants visited many of
the itinerant shows that came to Berlin. Here they recorded the music of
performing troupes from Thailand , Japan (1901, 1909), India ,
Togo , Tunisia , the Hopi pueblo , Sri Lanka ,
Cameroon , Sudan , Samoa , Senegambia , Somalia
, and northern Scandinavia , among other "exotic" locales. The
Berlin records were labeled "archive recordings" (<i>Archivaufnahmen</i>),
thus designating their status as the earliest collections in the Berlin
Phonogram Archive and the material basis for its establishment. The
recording sessions took place at several venues, including the Zoological
Garden and the Circus Busch (where human and animal shows intermingled),
the Central-Hotel and the Wintergarten (upper-end variety theaters), the
Passage-Panoptikum and Castan's Panoptikum (wax museums), the Velodrome
(a bicycle track that doubled as an outdoor exhibition site) and Luna Park
(an amusement park on the outskirts of the city).
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  In Hornbostel's words, "the primal origins of music" were excavated
  in the fairgrounds of modern Berlin. Only from the viewpoint of the
  urban center could one construct a comparative taxonomy of cultures
  or an evolutionary history of origins.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

The Descent of Music
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
German comparative musicology took its opening cue from British
evolutionism. In 1885, Stumpf published the first German review of
"Music Psychology in England," a survey of the various theories of music
advanced by, among others, Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  Framing their work in terms of music psychology was admittedly
  problematic, for the distinctive claim of nineteenth-century
  evolutionary theory was, as Thomas Richards has shown, to calculate
  <i>all</i> things and arrange them in series of lineal development
  (<i>IA,</i> 48). At the same time, precisely because of its
  comprehensive scope, evolutionary theory had to explain the emergence
  of music or at least account for it in some way. Stumpf's review
  therefore concentrated on music's challenge to evolutionism (in the
  broadest sense) as an all-encompassing theory of origins. Though he
  surveyed a number of competing theories, Stumpf's use of Darwin is
  both important and indicative, for it served as a touchstone throughout
  his subsequent research and teaching. Darwin provides a key, that is,
  to Stumpf's own professional evolution as a comparative musicologist.

<p>
In <i>The Descent of Man</i> (1871, German translation 1875), Darwin
initially designated the existence of music as an evolutionary
conundrum: "As neither the enjoyment nor the capacity of producing musical notes
are faculties of the least use to man in reference to his daily habits
of life, they must be ranked amongst the most mysterious with which he
is endowed."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
  Music seemed to defy explanation not least of all because Darwin
  addressed it as a question of reproduction. To be sure, music could
  neither reproduce itself nor struggle for survival. "Nevertheless,"
  wrote Stumpf, "Darwin knew what to do. His answer could be summarized
  as follows: 'In the beginning was love.'"
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  Darwin tried to resolve the predicament of music by inventing his own
  origin myth, one that referred back (tautologically) to the creative
  principle of descent. Music first appeared in the animal kingdom,
  he argued, where it functioned as a "primitive" form of sexual
  selection, homologous to the colorful plumage of a bird. That most
  birds "sing" rendered this homology doubly compelling, embodying
  and thereby naturalizing the link between the existence of music
  and the principle of sexual selection. "Although the sounds emitted
  by animals of all kinds serve many purposes, a strong case can be
  made out that the vocal organs were primarily used and perfected in
  relation to the propagation of the species. . . . Every one knows how
  much birds use their vocal organs as a means of courtship; and some
  species may likewise perform what may be called instrumental music"
  (<i>DM,</i> 875-6). By defining music as a kind of sexual lure,
  Darwin incorporated it into the more familiar laws of selection and
  inheritance that governed his own thesis of "descent by modification"
  first elaborated in <i>The Origin of Species</i>.

<p>
Darwin's theory of music rested on two assumptions that Stumpf found
equally preposterous: namely, that birds could be seen as evolutionary
ancestors of human beings, and that the "intermediate stages"
(<i>Zwischenstufen</i>) between man and his closest relatives could
also be found in music ("ME," 309). As Stumpf commented in a subsequent
lecture: "The much sought-after human ape can at least be imagined, if
not actually found," whereas a musical equivalent to the human ape or
"missing link" was

<b></b>

unimaginable.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  In other words, a freak of nature may exist&#8212;indeed, it
  must for Darwin&#8212;but there was no such thing as a freak of
  music. Nevertheless, this shift in Stumpf's interest from the
  origins to the intermediate stages was entirely consistent with
  nineteenth-century evolutionary thinking. As Richards notes,
  "The project of Darwinian morphology . . . fixed its sights on
  the grey areas between forms. It sought to verify the existence of
  forms between forms" (<i>IA,</i> 55). Once these liminal spaces were
  identified, the gaps in an evolutionary sequence could be filled,
  and the sequence rendered continuous. As we shall see, Stumpf and his
  assistants would take up this project by locating the gaps between
  ancient, "primitive," and modern music, and extrapolating the forms
  that ostensibly connected them.

<p>
Stumpf's critique of Darwin provided him with an occasion for redefining
music in the context of scientific positivism. What distinguished music
from "the sounds emitted by animals," Stumpf argued, was its formal
organization based on the interval, the variable difference in pitch
between two sounds. This had a number of important consequences. First,
the question of music became a specifically human one. The production
and the enjoyment of fixed intervals presupposed the capacity for
abstract thought, which was held to be uniquely human. Insofar as animal
sounds resembled musical intervals, that resemblance was coincidental,
a fortuitous expression of "the pleasure in sound as such, not the
pleasure in musical intervals" ("ME," 312-3). Second, the search for the
origins of music became synonymous with the search for the origins of
musical intervals. "Somewhere, somehow, intervals must have been invented
(even by the mysterious human ape, if you like), and thus began music"
("ME," 313-4). This new exploration would still involve identifying the
existence of gaps between forms in order to fill them retrospectively, but
the developmental sequence that it aimed to reconstruct would encompass
only humans. The leap across the perceived divide between humans and
animals was one that Stumpf himself refused to make. Moreover, rather
than calculate all things that ever existed, he would concentrate on
musical forms in particular. In so doing, Stumpf established a modified
notion of evolution, one that maintained a strict separation between
humans and animals. His appropriation of the discourse of evolution
redefined its parameters for an exact science of music.

<p>
On the most basic level, however, Darwin's "lack of an empirical
foundation" pointed to a gap in the discourse itself ("ME," 308). Stumpf
was not alone in his objection. Throughout the 1870s, Germany's leading
anthropologists, Adolf Bastian and Rudolf Virchow, made this same argument
in their reviews of Darwin's books as well as in their famous dispute
with Darwin's German popularizer, Ernst Haeckel.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  Bastian and Virchow took this as grounds for discarding evolution
  entirely, focusing instead on the "elementary ideas" of humanity and
  the multiplicity of cultural forms that issued from those ideas. What
  makes Stumpf's 1885 review so remarkable, then, is that it begins with
  a typically German critique of British science, but arrives at an
  unexpected conclusion: Rather than dismiss Darwin's claims in toto,
  Stumpf would adopt the evolutionary assumption, while concentrating
  his own efforts on gathering "facts" about the origins of music in
  order to rectify the dearth of empirical research.

<b></b>

<p>
Countering Darwin's conjectures with hard evidence demanded wide-scale
recording, collecting, and cataloging. It called, in other words, for
the building of an archive. However Stumpf differed from anti-Darwinists
in German anthropology, all agreed that the historical development of
culture could be directly apprehended through the study of "primitive"
peoples. As Darwin himself noted, "We see the musical faculties, which
are not wholly deficient in any race, are capable of prompt and high
development, for Hottentots and Negroes have become excellent musicians,
although in their native countries they rarely practice anything that
we should consider music" (<i>DM,</i> 878-9). Stumpf set out to find
his own informants.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Acoustic Selection
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Here is a primal scene of comparative musicology: Nine Bella Coola
Indians perform a "Cannibal Dance" before a long-pole lodge. They sing
while beating drums, shaking rattles, and rhythmically stomping their
feet. A group of scientists, seated before them, watches and listens. This
scene&#8212;and its audience is part of the spectacle&#8212;would be
repeated numerous times not in British Columbia, where the performers
originated, but in Berlin, Cologne, Dresden, Hamburg, Leipzig,
and other German cities. From 1885 to 1886, Carl Hagenbeck, the
consummate showman of Imperial Germany, exhibited his latest troupe
of ethnographic performers not only for urban crowds, but also for
scientific experts. While the Bella Coola drew mixed reactions from
commercial audiences (for whom they looked "too European"), for Germany's
scientific elite they were sensational in every sense of the word.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
In November of 1885, the troupe made a special appearance before the
Institute for Geography at the University of Halle (<a name="1"
HREF="10.2ames_res.html#1"> 1</a>). Here, Stumpf intended
to conduct his first experiment in the psychology of non-Western music,
beginning the empirical research needed to support an evolutionary theory
of music.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  While his colleagues watched the performers, Stumpf was poised to
  transcribe the music by hand. He would fail. Stumpf describes his
  uneasy sense of drowning in the performance, "swimming" in a turbulent
  sea of unfamiliar sounds.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  The spectacle wrenched this listener from his position of cool
  detachment, immersing him in a sensory riot. "As the actors grew more
  passionate," he remarks, "the musical intervals, whose arrangement
  is in many ways unfamiliar to our ears, became increasingly
  unintelligible" ("LBI," 406). Though Stumpf took Native American
  music seriously, its apparent inscrutability seemed to corroborate the
  absolute distinction between European "art music" (<i>Tonkunst</i>)
  and non-European "natural music" (<i>nat&uuml;rliche Musik</i>) that
  Eduard Hanslick had drawn in 1854: "When South Sea Islanders rattle
  wooden sticks rhythmically, while sounding out an incomprehensible
  howl [<i>ein unfa&szlig;liches Geheul</i>], that is <i>natural</i>
  music, because it is not music at all."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  Stumpf's initial impression of the Bella Coola gave him no obvious
  reason to challenge this received idea; nor did his fragmentary
  transcriptions of their music offer any evidence to the contrary.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  The ethnographic exhibition had issued in a disorienting barrage
  of sensory stimuli that initially resisted transcription. As a
  stenographer, Stumpf had tested his powers of hearing and notation,
  and failed on both accounts.

<b></b>

<p>
Yet the problems of aural perception and acoustic legibility
only served to heighten the scientist's curiosity. After the
performance, Stumpf gained permission from Hagenbeck's agents,
Captain Johan Adrian Jacobsen and his brother Fillip, to have
a private audience with one of the singers, Nuskilusta (see <A
HREF="10.2ames_res.html#1"> 1</a>).
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  They spent four evenings together in the Institute, working for one
  to two hours at a time. While Nuskilusta rehearsed the troupe's
  various songs more than ten times each, Stumpf plodded ahead
  with his hand-written scores ("LBI," 407). These private recitals
  differed in important ways from the public exhibitions; as Stumpf
  noted in his report, "Nuskilusta stopped rattling a piece of wood
  in his hand when he noticed that it disturbed me" ("LBI," 409). Such
  modifications could, he acknowledged, potentially distort the results
  of his experiment. "Nuskilusta kept the tempo slow, perhaps out
  of consideration for me, but also because [the solo performance]
  lacked the same effect that was produced by the collective singing
  and dancing" ("LBI," 408). Problems of this kind could be resolved
  by what he defined as precise means of measurement: "At home, then,
  working from memory, I determined the tempo with a metronome, which one
  can do with great reliability" ("LBI," 408-9). During the day, he also
  attended the Bella Coola's public shows at a local beer garden, where
  he checked his revised transcriptions against the choral performances.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  Hours of intensive listening began to pay off, he observed, for "now
  I could hear more than mere howling; I could hear the melodies just
  as Nuskilusta had sung them <i>solo</i>" ("LBI," 408; italics in
  original). The isolation and repetition of the individual singer's
  voice allowed Stumpf to train and adapt his aural response to the
  unfamiliar texture of Bella Coola music. If a melody

<b></b>

could be picked out from the "howling," then the strict separation
between European art music and natural music must be, Stumpf reasoned,
at once willed and tenuous. "With respect to music, we should not speak
too offhandedly of 'wild, uncultivated' peoples."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<p>
The blatant staginess of Hagenbeck's show did not undermine its
"authenticity" for Stumpf. On the contrary, it shook his faith in
travelogues and scientific studies that relied on acoustic evidence
gathered abroad.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  Claiming the authority of having "been there," travelers often
  presented full scores of non-European music, but consistently elided
  any mention of the methodological problems of transcription. While
  some had little or no training in musical notation, even the most
  gifted or meticulous stenographers, as travelers who were merely
  "passing through," had virtually no opportunity to double-check
  their work. Ironically, ethnographic exhibitions chipped away at
  the legitimacy of travelogues, poking holes in their facade of
  completeness.

<p>
For an expert in psychoacoustics, Stumpf's experiment confirmed
that listening habits were not merely subjective, but culturally
conditioned. Nineteenth-century audiences in Germany (and elsewhere)
heard non-Western music in many and sometimes conflicting ways. Listeners
such as Hanslick dismissed "natural music" as "not music at all"; on
the opposite end of the spectrum, others failed to apprehend its status
as non-Western. Stumpf and his assistants repeatedly cautioned against
what they understood as the common tendency "to hear with European ears,"
that is, to treat non-European music as though it were based on familiar
structures of harmony.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  This tendency was of particular concern for the stenographer, whose
  predicament Stumpf described by way of a visual analogy:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When one leafs through old, illustrated travelogues, one is amazed at
the Europeanized facial features of "savages," as they used to be called
(despite the exaggerated family resemblance to Europeans). It was simply
not possible for draftsmen to see objectively; and, for all of their
naturalism, it remains impossible for them to do so today. The pencil is
guided not by the eye, but by the brain, in which the accustomed facial
features leave a lasting impression. ["BP," 65-6]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The creation of residual images, he suggested, had an acoustic corollary
in what we might call residual sounds, echoes of harmony that faintly
ring in "European ears." If this penchant for hearing diatonically was
an inadvertent effect of subjective perception, however, it was also
a problem that one could correct. "To free oneself from such habits,"
Hornbostel stated in his 1905 report, "requires a special practice,
a training <i>ad hoc</i>" ("PM," 50). Researchers would have to attune
themselves (literally) to musical alterity, while casting away more
familiar ways of listening. Insofar as aural training depended not
on source criticism (e.g., musical transcription), but on extensive
exposure to live music, it also required an unprecedented degree of
access to non-European peoples.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Around 1900, access and availability provided a rationale for making
  repeated visits to local, urban entertainments, where scientists
  could simultaneously recalibrate their sense of hearing and develop
  a corresponding method of "objective" representation ("TMS," 170).

<b></b>

<p>
Rather than speculate on the significance of Bella Coola songs, Stumpf set
out to transcribe them: "It was our intention to provide only phonographic
reproductions of the audible [<i>phonographische Nachbildungen des
Geh&ouml;rten</i>], so to speak, not theoretical observations" ("LBI,"
424). In this instance, "phonographic reproductions" alluded not to
Edison's talking machine (which Stumpf had yet to employ), but to the
idea of nonarbitrary writing, or "phonography," as it was understood
in the mid-nineteenth century. As James Lastra notes, "the very term
'phonography' initially referred to a stenographic system developed
by Isaac Pitman in 1837, which, by transcribing <i>sounds</i> instead
of words, was expected to offer a more direct, almost analogical form
of writing."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  Though Stumpf would use a conventional form of musical notation,
  Pitman's system appealed to him as an ideal mode of acoustic
  representation and shaped his own discourse on non-Western music. The
  search for an objective means of recording, unmediated by the presence
  of the stenographer, would propel Stumpf throughout his career.

<p>
The results of this first experiment augured well for the success of
future research. The ethnographic exhibition provided ample resources for
analyzing the rhythmic organization and melodic texture of Bella Coola
music. Stumpf concluded that Nuskilusta employed a coherent "tone system"
based on a five-step musical scale, which "must have been the result
of a cultural development [<i>eine geistige Entwicklung</i>]." Not
only did this suggest that the Bella Coola possessed a concept of
musical intervals&#8212;a claim, as we have seen, that supported his
critique of Darwin. In addition to its manifest importance for music
psychology, it led Stumpf to assert his project's ethnographic potential:
"In time, such studies will also acquire anthropological significance,
beyond their musicological value, inasmuch as they identify new traits
[<i>Kennzeichen</i>] for establishing the relationship or interaction
between different tribes" ("LBI," 405). Most importantly, this conclusion
brought European and non-European music into calculable proximity. Radical
new comparisons could now be made and even verified. One evening,
after listening to Nuskilusta, Stumpf attended a recital of Bach's High
Mass, where he experienced an epiphany indeed: Perhaps the "expansion"
(<i>Ausdehnung</i>) of different evolutionary stages could be charted
in terms of musical intervals, he proposed, by "measuring the distance
between Bach and Nuskilusta" ("LBI," 426). Thus Stumpf imagined a much
larger and more ambitious project, an evolutionary science of music.

<p>
This evolutionary imaginary, it must be stressed, was entirely a
function of spectatorship, for Hagenbeck's display made no attempt to
construe evolution visually. On the contrary, the Bella Coola show,
like so many of Hagenbeck's ethnographic exhibitions, was modeled on
the variety program, with its "montage" of dance numbers, magic acts,
and musical performances. Rather than organize human displays as visual
corollaries of Darwinian narratives, Hagenbeck choreographed a diverse
series of kinetic and multisensory attractions. He further distinguished
himself as an ethnographic showman by representing "typical" scenes of
everyday life in foreign lands. In the context of urban entertainment,
Hagenbeck's practice of hyperbolic collection&#8212;importing vast
numbers of humans, animals, plants, objects, and entire buildings, all

<b></b>

for the purpose of display&#8212;served mainly to render the exotic
accessible to mass audiences.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  At the same time, his insistence on the "authentic" and the "typical"
  appealed to an elite group of anthropologists (led by Bastian and
  Virchow), whose approval Hagenbeck needed in order to legitimate his
  own ethnographic enterprise. However the entrepreneur excelled at
  "managing" an entire network of discourses on the exotic, these
  discourses would exceed his control. A spectator such as Stumpf,
  who brought with him a different set of goals and expectations,
  would hear the performances as living evidence of evolution.

<p>
Stumpf's "first encounter" with the Bella Coola offers a preview of what
it would take to render evolution audible with the aid of a phonograph
(and a productive analogy to what would later be known as fieldwork).
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  It demonstrates, in particular, how listening functions as a
  scientific technique. In order to render the Bella Coola's music
  legible and comprehensible, Stumpf had to reduce the ensemble to a
  solo singer. Further, the props and stage settings of Hagenbeck's
  show&#8212;the elements that the impresario had used to create a
  convincing expression of exotic space and to immerse spectators in
  the depicted scene&#8212;were deliberately screened out of the private
  recitals. In their place, Stumpf constructed a new performance context,
  one specially designed for inscribing sounds in isolation. But which
  sounds counted as music, and which ones as noise? Distinguishing a melody from "mere howling" required still other acts of
acoustic reduction and selection. On the one hand, noises that "disturbed"
the stenographer (the shaking of rattles and stomping of feet) needed to
be eliminated. On the other hand, the musical rudiments that intrigued
him (melody, rhythm, and intonation) had to be identified, amplified,
and repeated. Only by restaging the musical performance in its entirety
and manipulating the terms of its occasion&#8212;now with the solo
singer repeating particular notes or passages upon request&#8212;could
the stenographer produce the effects of acoustic legibility and
"objectivity" that he would claim for his transcriptions. Acoustic
objectivity was therefore a function not of the distance between science
and entertainment, but of the power to choreograph. As "participant
observer," the scientist became a kind of impresario in his own right.

<p>
In 1887, Stumpf ran a similar experiment at Hagenbeck's Ceylon
Exhibition in Berlin. Not until 1900, when he and his new assistants at
the Psychology Institute equipped themselves with a phonograph, would
they find a writing system that met the standards of a science committed
to positivism. By that time, the crisis of legibility had acquired new
meaning in the context of imperialism and mass culture. The expansion of
the German empire, and particularly its acquisition of colonies between
1884 and 1900, posed an immediate threat to the existence of indigenous
music. The question now was whether sound technology would preserve such
music or, conversely, hasten its demise.


<h3>

Voices of the Dead
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Early mass culture and new technology commonly promised to bring distant
people and places closer together than ever before.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  At the same time, the global logic of

<b></b>

access and connectedness gave rise to new anxieties about the consequences
of too much proximity. Throughout their writings, Stumpf and Hornbostel
would take turns lamenting the "annihilation," "homogenization," and
"modernization" of non-European music. They consistently emphasized
two interrelated forces of transformation, namely, colonialism and
circulation. In so doing, however, comparative musicologists assailed
the infrastructure that made possible not only the ethnographic
exhibition&#8212;their initial source of data&#8212;but also their own
still nascent discipline.

<p>
Paradoxically, Stumpf and his assistants advocated the wide-scale
collection of non-European music in reaction to imperialist
expansion. "The more relentlessly European culture invades foreign parts
of the earth and drives declining forms [of music] if not also their
carriers to the brink of extinction, the more it is time to collect and
study them" ("TMS," 167). The conquest of space rendered time of the
essence. That was precisely the logic that Adolf Bastian had employed
in his 1881 call for an ethnological museum in Berlin:
"The existence of natural peoples is for us only ephemeral; that is, they
exist for us only insofar as our knowledge of them and our relationships
to them are concerned. The moment that they meet us, the angel of death
is upon them. From then on, struck by the angel, they carry the seed of
decline within them."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  Bastian's apocalyptic vision of "first contact" invokes the notion of
  biological contagion; colonialism was the virus within the bloodstream
  of native peoples.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  Thus Bastian and Stumpf each prescribed the antidote of immediate
  collection and preservation. They understood collection not as
  a protest against colonialism, but as a reflection of Germany's
  imperial power, a commitment to the stewardship of its colonies and
  resources. Imperial prestige and custodianship here meant, above all,
  funding and maintaining urban institutions, from the Royal Museum
  of Ethnology, which was established in 1886, to the Berlin Phonogram
  Archive.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Comparative musicologists reacted in equally paradoxical fashion against
modern systems of circulation. In 1908, Stumpf predicted that music
"will in the future belong to the indispensable signs that will inform
us about contacts among the peoples and tribes of the earth&#8212;their
relationships, migrations, and trade connections&#8212;provided that we
do not wait until the expansion of world traffic [<i>Weltverkehr</i>] has
obscured all of their characteristic differences" ("BP," 75-6). Reports
from abroad seemed to verify what Stumpf had surmised in Berlin, where
the networks of circulation had already transformed urban experience in
tangible ways. Shortly before the outbreak of World War I, for instance,
Albert Schweitzer wrote a letter to Stumpf in which he described the
scene in Gabon, Africa: "Motorboats are increasingly replacing rowboats,
as the foreign trading posts prefer them. In the foreseeable future
there will no longer be any day-long journeys by rowboat, with twenty
men in a canoe standing one behind the other, singing in order to keep
time in their rowing, i.e. end of the rowing song."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  For Schweitzer it seemed that the motor of modernity would overpower
  the "natural rhythms" of native life, leaving in its wake traditional
  means of transportation and their corresponding forms of cultural
  expression. The doctor's letter not only confirmed Stumpf's own
  diagnosis; it conveyed urgency to comparative musicology as a
  salvage operation. As Hornbostel quipped in his Vienna lecture:
  "We must rescue what there

<b></b>

is left to rescue, before the airship reaches the automobile and the
electric speed-train, before we hear Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-Der-&Eacute; in all
of Africa and The Beautiful Song of Little Cohn in the South Seas."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  The last vestiges of "original" music had to be collected and
  preserved, he declared, before new technologies of transportation
  and communication delivered mass culture to the colonies.

<p>
As the sardonic references to popular Western music were meant to suggest,
Hornbostel feared that the dissemination of gramophone records in the
colonies would "contaminate" his data at the source. "The coming of
Christianity spreads European church songs everywhere, the introduction of
school lessons our folk songs, the colonial troops our military marches,
and the gramophones of the colonials our worst popular hits. But what,
we ask, gets lost along the way?" ("EM," 91). Part of the problem, he and
his colleagues believed, was that "primitive peoples have a remarkable
talent for imitation and assimilation."
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  This penchant for mimicry, so the argument ran, made colonized peoples
  especially susceptible to losing their own traditions. Paradoxically,
  then, non-European music had to be rescued from the people who
  created it. Imitation and assimilation represented more than a loss of
  "originality," in all senses of the word. They posed a threat to the
  order of things&#8212;the evolution of music&#8212;at precisely the
  moment when comparative musicologists began to chart it. Unless drastic
  measures were taken to preserve non-European music in its "original"
  form, went the logic, it would rapidly and irreversibly mutate beyond
  recognition. The solution was not simply to deploy one mobility system
  (sound technology) against others (planes, trains, and automobiles),
  for the circulation of "canned" music only exacerbated this crisis
  of originality. From the beginning, Emil Berliner's gramophone was
  primarily designed for playback rather than recording. Therefore,
  while sound technology ostensibly offered a solution, its prime
  instrument, the gramophone, promoted mimicry and in so doing threw
  "originality" back into question. The circulation of gramophone
  records in the colonies was simply too effective. In such a context,
  the Deutsche Grammophon Company's famous trademark, "The Recording
  Angel," represented no longer a modern form of transcendence, but in
  Bastian's terms a new "angel of death."

<p>
As key forms of technology and mass culture, the gramophone and the
phonograph participated in the very crisis that comparative musicologists
considered a threat to music's existence. In at once lamenting and
requiring them, Stumpf and Hornbostel held deeply ambivalent attitudes
toward modern techniques of circulation. These attitudes shaped
their project in crucial ways, beginning with their choice of sound
technology. If the gramophone potentially garbled the sound of evolution,
how could the phonograph but do otherwise?

<p>
Unlike the gramophone, Edison's invention permitted every user to record
sound as well as to reproduce it. In his 1878 article "The Phonograph and
Its Future," Edison foresaw "the almost universal applicability of the
[machine's] foundation principle, namely, the gathering up and retaining
of sounds hitherto fugitive, and their reproduction at will."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  In comparative musicology&#8212;a context unavailable to
  Edison&#8212;the principle of recording and reproduction would indeed
  resound. On the most basic level, the phonograph's dual function
  enabled Hornbostel and his colleagues to distinguish

<b></b>

conceptually between playback and recording: Whereas mass reproduction
threatened to "homogenize" non-European music, recording promised to
"fix" or "capture" that music in all its particularity. Thus phonography
offered a unique means of preserving the alterity of "exotic melodies,"
which is to say, a means of constructing it technologically and
discursively.

<p>
To understand how the phonograph could be mobilized "ethnographically," we
must acknowledge its difference as a medium. In one sense, phonography had
a greater impact on late-nineteenth-century audiences than photography,
for the latter medium could be seen, as Mark Sandberg suggests, "as a
refinement of realistic trends in painting and illustration, in which
the displacement of the visually depicted object in space and time was
a common enough phenomenon. But in phonography, the displacement of
the acoustic world through recording technology was truly astounding
and unprecedented."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
  To be sure, its novelty made Edison's invention a source of public
  fascination, if not an instant commercial success.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  From 1878 through the late 1880s, Edison rented the earliest models
  of his talking machine to professional entertainers, who demonstrated
  its wonders at traveling shows and world's fairs.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
  Like Hagenbeck's ethnographic exhibition, Edison's invention teetered
  between science and sensation, and too, in order to be refunctionalized
  for ethnography, the phonograph, like the ethnographic exhibition,
  would have to be stripped of its sensational qualities. By the turn
  of the century, its novelty had waned, to be replaced by new modes
  of curiosity. In 1896, the inaugural issue of <i>The Phonoscope</i>
  would predicate its own novelty on the fact that its subject matter
  was now pass&eacute;, and therefore interesting at a previously
  unimagined level:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The Talking Machines have long since passed the point of novelty,
occupying today a foremost place among the standard inventions of this
progressive age. . . . The curiosity of hearing a machine talk has given
way to a more serious consideration, and today the general public is
convinced of its great possibilities, and is prepared to welcome its
entrance into practical utility in almost any sphere. The Phonograph has
made its way into many institutions, where it is used for educational
and scientific purposes.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Though the phonograph's social function had indeed undergone
transformation, this claim to its universal acceptance was
premature. Stumpf and Hornbostel still had to assure their
audiences&#8212;spanning popular lectures, newspaper articles, and
official correspondences&#8212;that they used the device as not a
mass-cultural source of aesthetic pleasure, but a scientific instrument.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  A German advertisement maintained as late as 1896 that "the best
  display object is and remains a good phonograph."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  Just as the talking machine was leaving the fairground and entering
  the bourgeois household, where it would be domesticated as a piece
  of furniture, comparative musicologists tried to move it into the
  scientific laboratory.

<p>
Retooling the phonograph for the study of "exotic melodies" required a
series of discursive maneuvers, for the talking machine was initially
intended not for music, but the human voice. The late-nineteenth-century
discourse on the phonograph revolved around the medium's claim to give
voice to the dead. As Edison's coworker and publicist

<b></b>

Edward H. Johnson famously stated, "A strip of indented paper travels
through a little machine, the sounds of the latter are magnified,
and our great grandchildren or posterity centuries hence hear us as
plainly as if we were present. Speech has become, as it were, immortal."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
  The phonograph promised to overcome the ephemerality of the body for
  the benefit of future generations. Thus conceived, it functioned as
  a kind of time capsule, preserving the voices of famous individuals
  like Gladstone, Bismarck, and other "immortals." Vienna's Phonogram
  Archive intended, for instance, to "bottle up all the noise of the
  century" by securing "personal statements of distinguished men."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  This fascination with speaking across generations extended into the
  domestic household, fulfilling Edison's prediction that the apparatus
  would become a unique family record: "For the purpose of preserving
  the sayings, the voices, and <i>the last words</i> of the dying
  member of a family&#8212;as of great men&#8212;the phonograph will
  unquestionably outrank the photograph."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
  In 1900, <i>The Phonoscope</i> would concur: "Death has lost some of
  its sting since we are able to forever retain the voices of the dead."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>

<p>
This discourse on the phonograph deeply resonated with Stumpf and
Hornbostel, who selectively modified its key tropes and inflected them
ethnologically. Rather than concentrate on the individual voices of
distinguished men or loved ones, comparative musicologists gathered the
"collective" sounds of non-European music. In so doing, they employed
the metonymic logic of ethnographic exhibition, where the individual body
of the performer represented the larger, absent whole (or "people"). By
virtue of metonymy, "voices of the dead" came to describe the songs of
entire, allegedly vanishing, populations. "Unlike physics or literary
history, archaeology or polar research," wrote Hornbostel, "studies whose
object are so-called natural peoples cannot be put off for decades or
even years. As we know, the last Athapaskan or the last Pueblo Indian
will soon have followed the last of the Mohicans to the eternal hunting
grounds" ("EM," 90-1). Music's ephemeral quality compounded the problem
of studying non-Western peoples. Comparative musicology was thus endowed
with a sense of mimetic urgency unmatched by anthropology. "The tangible
products of non-European cultures are collected in ethnological museums,
as completely as is possible today. But just as rapidly as these products
disappear&#8212;indeed, more rapidly&#8212;word and sound fade away."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
  Hornbostel and his fellow archivists sought the advantages of
  phonography in order to rescue the doubly fugitive: the fleeting
  sounds of vanishing peoples.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Shape of Evolution
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In his 1885 essay "The Scope, Method, and Aim of Musicology," the German
scholar Guido Adler explains the new discipline's analytical approach
in archaeological terms: "When a work of art is under consideration,
it must first of all be defined palaeologically. If it is not written in
our notation, it must be transcribed. Already in this process significant
criteria for determining the work's time of origin may be gained. Then
its structural nature is examined."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  The first step in this procedure is to establish the chronological
  origin of a musical piece, as a natural scientist would determine
  the age of a fossil record or a geological stratum. Adler goes on to
  describe each subsequent

<b></b>

step in anatomical and evolutionary terms. "His style-critical method
begins with an anatomical dissection of a work of art in order to
ascertain its species, and his framing of stylistic laws can, in a sense,
be equated with determining the laws of musical 'natural selection.'"
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
  In his own programmatic statement on "The Problems of Comparative
  Musicology," Hornbostel studiously employs the metaphors of
  archaeology, anatomy, and evolution that Adler had used earlier. The
  comparative orientation itself was, as Hornbostel noted, a "general
  method" adapted from anatomy, zoology, and linguistics in order to
  create a new area of study. "The comparative method came late to
  musicology, because its object, in contrast to that of all other
  fields, had been relatively difficult to collect" ("PM," 41). That
  changed with the introduction of the phonograph. Now one could not
  merely collect non-Western music en masse, but "dissect" a particular
  song, "lay bare" its inner structure, compare it with that of other
  songs, and thereby extrapolate the morphological development of
  music around the world ("PM," 42, 56). In comparative musicology,
  the evolution of music would take shape in and take its shape from
  the act of recording. Its specific conration depended, however,
  upon the kind of narrative that Hornbostel and his colleagues sought
  to construct. Phonography allowed them to speak of a body of music,
  and to shape it discursively into various forms.

<p>
To speak of a body of music was, in this context, to assert its
solidity. Recording technology granted new materiality to sound,
allowing "exotic melodies" to be handled in Hornbostel's words as
"tangible products." In so doing, phonography brought music into
the realm of material culture. In acquiring the status of an object,
non-Western music could be collected, transported, exchanged, and stored
as never before. It seemed too, at least for a moment, that music itself
would warrant&#8212;and indeed be capable of occupying&#8212;a space of
display. In 1903, the Berlin anthropologist Felix von Luschan proposed
that the Royal Museum of Ethnology, where he served as head curator of
the Africa and Oceania sections, install phonographs next to showcases
of musical instruments. Recorded music, he claimed, should supplement
visual displays, amplifying objects that would otherwise remain mute,
and thereby enhancing the museum's sensory appeal to audiences.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
  Stumpf voiced the same idea in his 1908 plea for donations to the sound
  archive: "Without the help of the phonograph, we are left standing
  before the museum showcase, in which instruments are preserved
  silent as the grave, full of wonder but empty of understanding"
  ("BP," 67). The uncanny little machine would transform the displayed
  instruments by bringing them back to life. However much this idea may
  have fascinated the public, Stumpf's call for support went unheeded. In
  contrast to the ethnological museum, the phonogram archive was not
  dedicated to the exhibition of things; rather, it was a laboratory
  and a storehouse that had little to do with the public sphere and
  everything to do with the scientific community.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  Even if recorded music were given a place in the museum (it was not),
  Luschan presumed that its content would immediately dissolve into the
  showcase, to be contained by the visual display of instruments (the
  center of attention). Only at the sound archive would the phonogram
  be handled as a material object in its own right.

<b></b>

<p>
The materiality of the phonogram consisted of grooves engraved in a wax
cylinder. Edison's patented "hill-and-dale recording" technique inscribed
sound vertically into the surface of a rotating cylinder, endowing it
with depth as well as solidity. Scientific interest in phonographic
inscriptions noted their indexical quality, the embodied relationship
between the sound emitted and its material trace. Unlike earlier talking
machines, such as P. T. Barnum's Euphonia, which simulated speech
mechanically, the phonograph registered the <i>physical</i> impressions
of sound vibrations. Rather than inscribe sound in terms of language or
symbolic notation, its stylus etched lines and points into wax; that is,
it did not translate, but transcribe. Edison's device was distinguished
from other "writing systems," as Friedrich Kittler puts it, in that
"only the phonograph can record all the noise produced by the larynx
prior to any semiotic order and linguistic meaning."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
  For Stumpf, the device offered a seemingly impartial method of
  gathering "raw data," unfiltered by "European ears" and unmediated
  by musical notation, thereby fulfilling the search for a nonarbitrary
  writing system he had begun in 1885.

<p>
By the same token, its indexical quality made the phonograph an ideal
technique for recording the music of oral cultures in particular, for
this music had never been set to writing. The absence of documentation
had already served German anthropology as a key criterion for defining
its object as "peoples without writing" (<i>schriftlose V&ouml;lker</i>).
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  The history of oral cultures could not, of course, be found in
  written sources. Instead, anthropologists assumed it was embedded in
  the material traces, such as tribal artifacts, that "peoples without
  writing" did in fact produce.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
  Comparative musicologists made the same assumption of their own object
  of study. That some non-European cultures apparently had no system
  of musical notation only served to justify the discipline's initial
  emphasis on recording as opposed to source criticism, for the latter
  method (advocated by Adler) presupposed the availability of musical
  "compositions."
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
  Sound technology rendered the history of non-Western music
  apprehensible not by supplying the missing manuscripts, but by
  producing a body of music that could be analyzed and measured as a
  physiological fact of the acoustic world. Stumpf and his assistants
  believed that evidence of evolution was hidden in the structure of
  "exotic melodies," which included&#8212;and depended upon&#8212;that
  of contemporary performances. A temporal medium par excellence, the
  phonograph offered a means of accessing the past through the sound
  of the present.

<p>
Abraham and Hornbostel correctly identified the phonograph's "special
advantage" as its capacity to manipulate sound as a function of time. Upon
playback, a record&#8212;indeed a single note&#8212;could be slowed
down, sped up, and endlessly repeated; a fragment of music could thus
be isolated, divided into its constituent parts, measured and analyzed
("BPM," 229). Retooled for the laboratory, the phonograph served as
a kind of surgical instrument. Hornbostel made no bones about it: "By
carefully segmenting and dissecting the melodic strand with a scalpel
[<i>Seziermesser</i>]&#8212;some people fundamentally condemn such
vivisection&#8212;we make the flow clot. The living event must be fixed
as a motionless corpse, and only thus is it possible to recognize the
now visible architecture of the whole."
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
  To <i>listen</i> with the aid of a phonograph was to <i>see</i> a body

<b></b>

of music, just as a doctor would observe a cadaver, splayed and flayed,
its internal structure exposed.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
  Here was a technique for locating and extracting what Hornbostel
  called the primal origins of music. Controlling the flow of sound
  allowed him to examine it in depth.
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
  As a result of recording, that is, the phonograph rendered musical
  performance available to other "physical-acoustic methods" such as
  the tonometer, a device that measured the frequency of an individual
  pitch in "cents" or hundredths of a semitone. In combining analogue
  and digital technologies (the phonograph and the tonometer,
  respectively), Abraham and Hornbostel demonstrated how recorded
  music could be quantified, calculated, and compared. This surgical
  operation made it possible to survey a body of music in its entirety,
  to identify resemblances and differences with other "exotic melodies,"
  and thus to establish a discourse of comparative musicology&#8212;a
  discourse that extended beyond morphology to posit larger, cultural
  and historical connections.

<p>
For all its promise, the phonograph could not speak for itself.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
  Hornbostel and his fellow archivists amassed thousands of records,
  none of which articulated the interpretation of the music it
  contained. Once dissected, the body of music had to be reassembled
  discursively. Representing the evolution of music required comparative
  musicologists to reconre their object once again, now in terms
  of narrative.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
  As a "physical-acoustic method," phonography established an object
  solid enough to meet the demands of scientific positivism, yet
  malleable enough to substantiate a diversity of theoretical claims.

<p>
Stumpf's 1909 public lecture series <i>The Origins of Music</i> offers
a case in point. In the first part, a reprise of his earlier article
on British evolutionism, Stumpf offers up his own, characteristically
"German" theory of origins. With a nod to Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, he
proclaims: "In the beginning was the deed." Music began, in other words,
with the creative act of sending signals (<i>Signalgebung</i>). In order
to make this hypothesis, he posits the existence of "pre-historic humans"
(<i>Urmenschen</i>). "How did they come to employ a fixed musical
interval?" When a single voice failed to be heard, Stumpf speculated,
many voices must have joined in, thereby amplifying the sound and
inadvertently creating the first experience of consonance. While the
chorus of voices presumably included a range of pitches, creating any
number of possible combinations, only one combination produces an effect
that could be taken for a single, unified tone: the octave. The original
chorus must have noticed this apparent unity and eventually come to prefer
it. Stumpf goes on to posit the stepwise development of other consonant
intervals, beginning with the smallest and least complex, fourths and
fifths, which he attributes to non-Western music in particular. "Even
in civilized Europe one can observe that natural peoples produce fifths
when they try to sing in unison."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
  To show how this theory plays out, Stumpf organized his subsequent
  lectures around a series of phonogram demonstrations, offering the
  public a rare chance to hear recordings from the Berlin Phonogram
  Archive. His introduction is worth quoting at length, for it
  complicates the evolutionary assumption on which his theory rested:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We begin the series with the most primitive songs that are available and
known to us, those of the Vedda in Ceylon. We will order what follows,
however, not according to the

<b></b>

principle of progressive development. Instead, we will pursue a
geographical trajectory from Ceylon eastward to the South Seas,
then to America, traversing it from South to North, until we reach
the Eskimos, and finally to Africa. Within the smaller, geographical
areas we will often observe progress in melodic formation. Yet it is
impossible to create a single, unambiguous series out of the collected
musical achievements of humanity, for progress has taken many different
directions. Conversely, we will discover more and more connections between
geographically neighboring or ethnologically related peoples, and thereby
gain a broad, coherent picture of musical practice. [<i>AM,</i> 107]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While organized as such for a popular audience, this "musical journey
around the world" inadvertently demonstrates the archival aporia in
representations of music's evolution (<i>AM,</i> 196). The archive
embodies the dream of objectivity, which, by virtue of the multiplicity
of sounds that it contains, resists any attempt to construct a single
narrative of progress. Therefore, although Stumpf's theory of origins
is predicated on the notion of lineal development, his phonogram
demonstrations are organized geographically, illustrating that musical
"progress" follows many and sometimes divergent paths. To plot these
trajectories did not necessarily mean to construct a linear model of
evolution (such as that posited by E. B. Tylor); in fact, evolutionary
thought assumed various forms.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
  Stumpf's lecture thus made no claims to linearity, continuity, or
  completeness, even as it continued to emphasize evolution.

<p>
In the course of their own professional development, Hornbostel and
his younger colleagues would focus less on origins and more on the
cultural connections among seemingly dissonant musical forms. Rather than
drawing schematic connections as direct lines or developmental series,
they preferred elliptical and discontinuous forms such as parallels
and circles.
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
  In their 1903 address to the Berlin Society for Anthropology, for
  example, Abraham and Hornbostel suggested that "If we may conceive
  of exotic music as primitive, thus situating it parallel to earlier
  developmental stages of European music, it would provide us with clues
  as to how music actually sounded in antiquity" ("BPM," 225). This
  Eurocentric proposal was based on a blatant, temporal fallacy,
  one that fundamentally confused morphology with history. Stumpf too
  would commit this fallacy in <i>The Origins of Music</i>, conflating
  the appearance of formal simplicity in "primitive songs" with the
  chronological beginnings of music itself. Evolutionary thinking
  made this idea compelling, allowing comparative musicologists not
  only to work backwards and forwards in time, and thereby generate
  developmental series, but also to move "diagonally" through space,
  in order to draw cultural parallels or analogies. The temporal
  fallacy was therefore based on the notion of the primitive, but not
  restricted to it. Phonography, in fact, established an object that
  could be imagined as occupying any number of intermediate stages on
  an evolutionary timeline, positioned at select intervals between
  the origins of music and its "modern" manifestations. Abraham and
  Hornbostel thus located "exotic music" not as a point of origin, but
  "parallel to earlier stages of European music."

<p>
Here they were referring to their own "Studies on the Tone System and
Music of the Japanese," based on Berlin recordings of Kawakami Otijoro's
musical theater troupe starring Sada Yakko. While recognizing that this
troupe was an icon of Japanese modernity,

<b></b>

Abraham and Hornbostel interpreted its music in terms of Westernization,
deploring the Japanese government's efforts to import songs, instruments,
and orchestrations from Europe and the United States.
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
  Here, again, they understood the price of modernization to be the loss
  of "charming originality," which the phonograph would nevertheless
  allow them to isolate, extract, and preserve for analysis ("TMJ,"
  67). More specifically, as a result of their studies, Abraham and
  Hornbostel identified "pure tuning [<i>reine Stimmung</i>] as the
  essential basis of contemporary Japanese music" ("TMJ," 33-4). This
  term referred back to Pythagorean intonation, a tuning of the scale
  in which all fourths and fifths are "pure" (untempered), thus making
  thirds sound out of tune to the modern ear. In locating a Pythagorean
  "root" of modern Japanese music, Abraham and Hornbostel felt permitted
  to posit a historical link to ancient Greek melody. This link, in turn,
  provided a basis for comparison by analogy: "It is safe to assume
  the common derivation of modern Europe's harmonic music and modern
  Japan's non-harmonic music; they are late fruits from the same tree"
  ("TMJ," 34-5). As Hornbostel would aver, now with conviction, "Exotic
  music offers astounding analogies to earlier forms of our own music,
  which we know only through a tradition that has gaping holes in it. We
  gain a better idea of how ancient Greek music must have sounded by
  listening to, say, Japanese musicians, than by reading the works of
  Classical authors" ("EM," 93).

<p>
At the turn of the century, the phonograph seemed uniquely equipped to
make evolution audible. The evolution of music would be heard not by
reading old manuscripts, but by listening to contemporary recordings
of exotic melodies. To listen in this way was to travel not simply
across generations, as Edison had imagined the use of his device, but
across the greater expanse of history and geography. In its function as
a scientific instrument, the phonograph established a tangible body of
music that could be dissected, like the re of the Hottentot Venus,
and reconstructed in a variety of forms. It shaped and reshaped the
discourse of comparative musicology, informing a succession of scientific
narratives. In this context, phonography came to serve at once as a
representational strategy for constructing the evolution of music,
and a system for traversing it. Just as the discipline of comparative
musicology would take shape by recasting the terms of evolution, its
prime instrument would render newly material evolution's sound.

"PM," 57; italics in original. Alexander Rehding has recently traced the
search for origins in German musicology around 1900 through the context
of the philosophy of origins (<i>Ursprungsphilosophie</i>). He argues
that origins should be understood not as a chronological category, but
rather as an "ontological" one, from which the temporal aspect has been
evacuated (<i>pace</i> Martin Heidegger). Yet these categories were never
so neatly separated as Rehding would seem to suggest. A wholly appropriate
emphasis on essentialism and ontology cannot adequately account for the
empirical methods and evolutionary theories of comparative musicologists
in particular. Nor can it explain the crucial role that a temporal medium
like the phonograph played as a scientific instrument for the study of
non-European music. At the turn of the century, comparative musicology
co-opted the search for origins in the context of scientific positivism,
and transformed it with the tools of modernity. This transformation can
only be seen if we veer from the center of academic musicology and explore
its periphery&#8212;that is, the discursive contexts in which non-Western
music circulated around 1900. These contexts frame comparative musicology
as a historical project that I understand as an attempt to render
evolution audible. See Alexander Rehding, "The Quest for the Origins of
Music in Germany Circa 1900," <i>Journal of the American Musicological
Society</i> 53, no. 2 : 345-85; hereafter abbreviated as "QO."

While film historians have recently begun to analyze the dynamic
interaction of anthropology and early cinema, they have thus far
paid relatively little attention to ethnomusicology and early sound
technology. (That project has been undertaken, I hasten to add, by
scholars of folklore and ethnomusicology, though mainly in a conventional
mode of disciplinary history.) Facile distinctions between the visual and
the acoustic do not suffice to explain this disparity in film studies,
especially in light of recent attempts to reconceptualize the history of
early cinema in terms of sound technology. Ironically, when seen against
the backdrop of Anglo-American anthropology and its vexed relationship
to the moving image, the case of German comparative musicology appears
extremely compelling. There are at least three reasons for this: First,
comparative musicologists held recording technology to be a necessary
condition for the possibility of conducting their research. Second,
this technology was crucial to the rise of comparative musicology as
an institution, evinced by the Berlin School and its phonogram archive,
which I will discuss in detail. Third, comparative musicologists commonly
affirmed the epistemological status of the phonographic record as
"acoustic evidence." Each of these points suggests that, in contrast to
early cinema's peripheral (if fascinating) relationship to anthropology,
the phonograph occupied a central position in comparative musicology. Even
while engaging the connections between Anglo-American anthropology and
the moving image, Alison Griffiths' important

Difference: Cinema, Anthropology, and Turn-of-the-Century Visual

This analogy is intended to suggest neither that the audible and
the visible were interchangeable, nor that their institutions were
disconnected from one another. In fact, the sound archive needs to be
located adjacent to the museum, the cinema, and even the department
store, for each of these institutions shaped the practical as well as
the imaginary work of comparative musicologists.

"BP," 83. In another context, Thomas Richards has argued that "the
imperial archive was a fantasy of knowledge collected and united in
the service of state and empire." Indeed, Stumpf envisaged the Berlin
Phonogram Archive as uniting disparate imperial agents and activities:
"The new empire is proud of its colonies and does everything in its
power to exploit them materially. It is our duty to combine that with
scientific exploitation, i.e. with research on the nature and the
indigenous culture of the new territories. Other colonial empires
have not neglected this <i>nobile officium</i>. We too have made an
excellent start, but wherever the culture of indigenous peoples is to be
described exactly, comprehensively, and scientifically in scholarly works,
phonographic records should not be lacking. And what then? Should they
be squandered and destroyed? No, they must of course be collected and
stored. Such an institution is a necessary corollary of our colonial
aspirations in the highest sense." Thomas Richards, <i>The Imperial
Archive: Knowledge and the Fantasy of Empire</i> (London: Verso, 1993),
6; hereafter abbreviated as <i>IA</i>; "BP," 83-4. On the imbrication of
technology and empire, see Daniel R. Headrick, <i>The Tools of Empire:

The comparative method and its rich tradition in the German sciences
surely help explain why Stumpf and his assistants conducted their research
in Berlin, whereas their American colleagues more often recorded music "on
location" (e.g., at Indian pueblos). At the same time, I would suggest,
the proliferation of ethnographic entertainments in Berlin represents
another (mass-cultural) context in which this preference for comparison
should be understood. On the comparative method, see Philip V. Bohlman,
"Traditional Music and Cultural Identity: Persistent Paradigm in the
History of Ethnomusicology," <i>Yearbook for Traditional Music</i> 20

1 : 261-349; hereafter abbreviated as "ME." Alexander J. Ellis'
pioneering study from the same year, "On the Musical Scales of Various
Nations," is generally acknowledged as the starting point of comparative
musicology because of its exemplary empirical method (tonometric analysis)
and its influential assumption that many non-Western scales exhibit
equal temperament. Stumpf made this study accessible to German-speaking
scientists by publishing a review of it in <i>Vierteljahrsschrift f&uuml;r
Musikwissenschaft</i> 2 : 511-24. But it was his earlier survey
of "Music Psychology in England" that helped establish evolutionism as
a theoretical framework for ethnomusicology. Here it is worth noting
that Georg Simmel had already offered his own theory of the origins of
music based on a critique of Darwin. Simmel's study is also prescient in
that it combines psychological and ethnological approaches, anticipating
the interdisciplinary strategy of comparative musicology. If Stumpf was
aware of Simmel's precedent, he did not refer to it. See Georg Simmel,
"Psychologische und ethnologische Studien &uuml;ber Musik," <i>Zeitschrift

In 1909, Stumpf distilled the major elements from this critique and
recast them in a popular idiom for a series of public lectures on "The
Origins of Music," an abridged version of which was first published
in <i>Internationale Wochenschrift f&uuml;r Wissenschaft, Kunst und

later reprinted in full as a monograph. I here quote this latter source

Working in the tradition of Hermann von Helmholtz, Stumpf understood
human perception to be embodied, and therefore subject to measurement
and control, but also deeply subjective and contingent. He was
particularly fascinated with the organization of psychology around
sound, with the ways in which sound is saturated with psychological
data. His 1883 monograph <i>Tonpsychologie</i> traces the impact of
sound waves on psychological functions in terms of aural perception,
judgment, and attention. On psychology and its relationship to early
ethnomusicology, see Carl Stumpf and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel,

In 1886, Stumpf received further confirmation of his transcription
from the young Franz Boas, who attended the same troupe's performance
in Berlin, transcribed two of their songs by hand, and published his
own linguistic studies of the Bella Coola. In 1893, Boas made the first
field recordings of Kwakiutl Indians&#8212;recordings that he would later
deposit at the Berlin Phonogram Archive. Boas became, of course, the
preeminent scholar of Northwest Coast Indians and one of the founders of
cultural anthropology in the United States. See "LBI," 408-9; Ira Jacknis,

"LBI," 426. Stumpf and his assistants would employ such terms as "wild"
and "uncivilized" in a self-conscious, strategic manner. Sometimes they
offset the word "primitive" in quotation marks so as to restrict the
range of its meaning. More often they used the (no less problematic)
term "exotic" in order to describe non-Europeans as well as their
musical productions (as in <i>exotische Melodien</i>). In so doing,
comparative musicologists were not quibbling over terminology, but making
an argument about

<b></b>

the legitimacy of their emergent discipline. Their use of "exotic" was
meant to counter the received idea that non-European music was "primitive"
(a term which had recently taken on such pejorative connotations as
"childlike" and "backward"), while stressing the complexity and confirming
the alterity of their object of study. They likewise retained the term
"natural peoples," but inflected it to denote non-Western peoples in
a historical sense. See, for example, Hornbostel's dictionary entry on
the "Musik der Naturv&ouml;lker," in the annual supplement to vol. 24
of <i>Meyers Gro&szlig;es Konversations-Lexikon</i>, 6th ed. (Leipzig:

In fact, comparative musicologists acknowledged that "cultural lands"
(<i>Kulturl&auml;nder</i>) such as India, China, and the Middle East
had their own musical documents (e.g., histories, theories, notation
systems) and experts (such as the Indian scholar S. M. Tagore). Yet
even as Hornbostel and his colleagues consulted some of these sources,
they reaffirmed the priority of phonographic recordings by stressing
the methodological difference between a "philological-literary study"
and a "musical study," such as their own, based on sound recordings. This
emphasis on recording was clearly announced by a series of articles, each
of which was titled "Phonographed [non-Western] Melodies." See, e.g.,
Otto Abraham and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel, "Phonographierte indische
Melodien" , trans. Bonnie Wade, in vol. 1 of <i>Hornbostel Opera

This "medical" mode of perception emerged in comparative musicology
against the backdrop of physical anthropology, which was a medical
science in nineteenth-century Germany. The founder of that discipline,
Rudolf Virchow, was an ardent opponent of evolutionism, as mentioned
earlier. If Abraham and Hornbostel (the one a practicing physician,
the other a trained natural scientist) took their perceptual model from
medical science, they transformed it not only for music, but also for an
evolutionist paradigm of comparative musicology. For more on Virchow and
medical science, see <i>PSC,</i> 51-5; Benoit Massin, "From Virchow to
Fischer: Physical Anthropology and 'Modern Race Theories' in Wilhelmine
Germany," in Stocking, ed., <i>Volksgeist as Method</i>, 79-154. For a

For this reason (among others), it is important not to assign too much
power to recording technologies like the phonograph. See on this point

Darwin was keenly aware of the problems that vision and narrative posed
to representing evolution. See James Krasner, <i>The Entangled Eye:
Visual Perception and the Representation of Nature in Post-Darwinian
Narrative</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992). Tony Bennett
has recently explored such problems in the context of evolutionary
museums. "Evolution and the Politics of Vision" (paper presented at

<p>
<a name="FOOT77" href="#REF77">77</a>.
The key context here was, of course, the "theory of cultural circles"
(or <i>Kulturkreislehre</i>). At a 1904 meeting of the Berlin Society
for Anthropology, the young museum curators Fritz Graebner and Bernhard
Ankermann publicly challenged the discipline's elder statesmen, Bastian
and Virchow, by advocating a "culture-historical method" based no longer
on the "universal" foundations of humanity, but on particular differences
between cultures. The so-called theory of cultural circles aimed to chart
the "diffusion" of particular "cultural traits" as people migrated across
the globe and intermixed with

<b></b>

other groups of people. It also allowed curators such as Graebner
and Ankermann to introduce evolutionary narratives into German
museum exhibits. Woodruff D. Smith has analyzed this shift in
German anthropology as "the diffusionist revolt" (see <i>PSC</i>,
140-61). I would argue that comparative musicologists also heralded
this scientific revolution, while attempting to ride into the
university on the coattails of anthropology. See Albrecht Schneider,
<i>Musikwissenschaft und Kulturkreislehre: Zur Methodik und Geschichte der
vergleichenden Musikwissenschaft</i> (Bonn: Verlag f&uuml;r systematische
Musikwissenschaft, 1976); for a brief summary in English, see "GA," 88-91.
