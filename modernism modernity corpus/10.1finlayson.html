<p>
One of the big questions Adorno's work raises concerns the normative
and evaluative ground of his ethical writings and of his social theory.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 In the major works of his mature philosophy&#8212; <i>Negative
 Dialectics</i> and <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>&#8212;Adorno criticizes the
 elements of social life that threaten the autonomy of the individual
 and that encourage individuals to adopt instrumental relations to
 other people and things.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Adorno's criticisms are unambiguously normative. In <i>Negative
 Dialectics</i><i>,</i> he describes his theory as "the ontology of the
 false state of things" and adds that "a right state of things would
 be free from dialectics: just as little a system as a contradiction."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 The rather puzzling counterposition of the attributes "false" and
 "right" betrays his underlying normative concern. Adorno has an emphatic
 conception of truth/falsity that is both Platonic and Hegelian. Insofar
 as he conceives truth as an aspect of the good, or rather the converse,
 untruth as an aspect of the bad, Adorno is a follower of Plato. Insofar
 as his conception of untruth "aims at bad actuality,"i.e., insofar as
 he maintains that untruth or falsity is embodied in the social world,
 Adorno follows Hegel.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 When Adorno claims that philosophy responds to a "world that is false
 to its innermost reaches," he means that it responds to a corrupt or bad
 world, to a world that ought not to be as it is (<i>ND</i>, 41 [31]).

<p>
That said, <i>Negative Dialectics</i>is not a work of normative ethical
theory, and Adorno's ethical concerns are atypical. He makes no attempt
to answer the central questions of normative ethics such as "What is
goodness?" "How should one live?" "What ought I to do?" etc. Even when
writing about Kant's practical philosophy,

<b></b>

Adorno, as befits someone who believed that "there is no right way to
live in a false world," shows little or no interest in normative ethical
theory (<i>MM</i>, 39; <i>PDM</i>, 9 [1]).
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<i>Negative Dialectics</i>, for example,is concerned rather
with the relation between concepts and objects. It is an immanent
criticism of Kantian epistemology and a qualified rehabilitation of
metaphysics. Ethical concerns arise because, according to Adorno,
universal concepts "violate," "mutilate," "dominate," and even
"liquidate" the particulars they subsume, and because thinking stands
accused of being in league with institutional and social structures of
domination. But it is not clear what normative implications, if any,
this thesis in neo-Kantian epistemology really has. While the normative
force of Adorno's work is open to view, its normative and evaluative
grounds remain obscure.

<p>
One of my aims in this essay is to suggest an answer to the question of
what the normative/evaluative grounds of Adorno's social philosophy are.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 I suggest that an answer is to be found in his metaphysics. An ancillary
 aim, not so obvious from my title, is to situate Adorno's metaphysics
 with respect to Hegel's. This is a necessary, if rather daunting
 preliminary, because Adorno's metaphysics are a kind of knowing
 dialectical inversion of Hegel's. Like Hegel, Adorno scrupulously
 refrains from normative ethical theory, and endorses Hegel's well-known
 criticisms of Kant's moral philosophy. Adorno is faithful to Hegel's
 famous dictum that the task of philosophy is not to "issue instructions
 as to how the world ought to be."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Adorno and Hegel both agree that philosophy aims at truth and that,
 as Hegel puts it in the <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, "what only
 ought to be, without in fact being, has no truth."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 To put it another way, Adorno has no truck with moralising and external
 criticism and expressly forbears from making such criticisms himself.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
This makes Adorno's position even less straightforward. For Hegel's
rejection of Kantian moralising criticism is grounded in, and depends
upon, his own ontotheological understanding of the task of philosophy,
namely to recognize the rational in the actual. But Adorno emphatically
rejects exactly this aspect of Hegel's ontotheology. Whilst Adorno agrees
that it is <i>not</i> the task of philosophy to tell the world how it
ought to be, unlike Hegel he makes very strong normative criticisms of
existing reality. This causes tension between Adorno's philosophical
allegiance to Hegel and his concomitant rejection of moralising criticism
on the one hand and his emphatic criticism of society on the other. How
can Adorno avoid presupposing normative criteria that are "external"
and "moralising," and thus remain a consistent pupil of Hegel, whilst
advancing a social philosophy that is both normative and critical?


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
1 Hegel's Metaphysical Project
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
I shall begin to answer this question by contrasting Hegel's social
philosophy with Adorno's. As already mentioned, in the Preface to the
<i>Elements of the Philosophy of Right</i> Hegel famously warns philosophy
not to set up a world beyond the present. He claims by contrast that
philosophy's task proper lies in comprehending "the present and the
actual," and in "showing how the state, as the ethical universe, should be

<b></b>

recognized." Philosophy's job is not to formulate laws for itself, but
to observe actual laws, to find their "inner-pulse," their rational core
(<i>EPR</i>, 21).
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 This line of thought needs to be understood in the context of Hegel's
 distinction between actuality and existence. "Actuality" (Wirklichkeit),
 which is sometimes translated misleadingly as "reality," is a technical
 term for Hegel, which applies to a much narrower domain than that
 of existence.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Hegel refers to the latter as "lazy (tr&auml;ge) existence" or
 "mere being."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 To understand what is lazy about existence we need to ask what
 makes actuality superior to it. In the domain of objective spirit,
 i.e. among all the institutions, practices, customs and beliefs that
 count as objectifications of the spirit, some, but not all, exist for
 good reasons. The difference is that actuality continues to exist for
 good reason, whilst lazy existence simply continues to exist.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Where an institution exists for good reasons, these reasons as it were
 nourish its existence. Moreover, the good reasons that support the
 actuality of one institution tend to accrete other such institutions:
 actuality spreads out along the axis of its underlying rationale.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 By contrast, where an institution exists for no good reason, there is
 no internal pressure for it to persist. Indeed, when all goes well,
 lazy existence tends to wither and lapse into non-existence. It is,
 though, only under favorable historical and social conditions that lazy
 existence dies out. Given unfavorable historical and social conditions,
 lazy existence stays put. Hegel certainly believed that in the time
 of "ferment" in which he lived, historical and social conditions in
 Germany were favorable for the development of actuality; but he also
 held that this process still had a rather long way to go.

<p>
There are two independently necessary and jointly sufficient conditions
of Hegelian actuality.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 An institution is actual in Hegel's sense if and only if

<p>
a. its existence satisfies the right of "the subject's
<i>particularity</i>," (<i>EPR</i>, 151) i.e. the institution satisfies
or does not thwart the basic interests of each subject, where a subject
is someone who participates in the institutions and practices that make
up the cultural life of a community; and

<p>
b. each subject can accept the institution because it satisfies his or
her basic interests.

<p>
In other words, if an institution or practice <i>does</i> satisfy the
interests of each participating subject, and if it can be accepted by
each subject because it satisfies their interests, then that institution
is actual; and conversely if an institution or practice is actual, it
manifestly satisfies the interests of all participating subjects. In
short, actuality is what is good and what can be known to be good.

<p>
A couple of qualifications are needed. Firstly, this account assumes that
what is good, is necessarily <i>good for</i> a person or persons. This
becomes important when one looks at the second condition, that actuality
can be known to be good. The second condition is that actuality can
be known to be good (for them) by those people for whom it is good,
not by some better knowing leader or elite, and not by some disembodied
impersonal spirit. Secondly, it is very important that there are two
separate conditions, which are only jointly sufficient for actuality. For
Hegel likens his philosophy to a "true theodicy" (<i>W</i>, 20: 455).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 This description is only meaningful if a false theodicy is
 possible. Hegel does not actually talk about false theodicy but he
 implies that one is possible. By implication, a false theodicy would
 be one that convinces us

<b></b>

that the world is good when it is not. A false theodicy would project
the illusion of actuality onto mere existence. It would convince subjects
that what merely exists, which is a bad state of affairs, is really good
(for them). To use a more modern idiom, a false theodicy would be a kind
of ideology.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
The second of these two jointly necessary conditions is indispensable,
because Hegel understands actuality to be an objective correlate of
subjective human freedom or what he calls "<i>the right of the subjective
will</i>" (<i>EPR</i><i>,</i> 158-59). Human beings are free to the extent
that only those things that they can recognize as rational&#8212;and
this applies across the board to institutions, laws, practices, beliefs,
emotions and feelings&#8212;have authority over them. If something claims
authority on the basis of its mere existence, then that authority is,
to use an expression of Hegel's youth, "positive" or dogmatic; it is a
form of domination and unfreedom. Hegel often makes this point in another
way. He contends that human subjectivity (or the "I") is free when it is
"at home" in the world and that, "'I' is at home in the world when it
knows it, and even more so when it has comprehended it" (<i>EPR</i>, 36).
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 That is, the rational human subject is "at home" or most free, where
 it is in its own element, the element of objectified human reason. In
 other words, human subjects are "at home" in actuality. There is a
 lot to be said about Hegel's multifaceted conception of freedom.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Suffice it here to say that, practically and politically speaking,
 Hegel's claim is that subjects are "at home" only when they can
 recognize&#8212;i.e. understand and affirm the underlying rationale
 of&#8212;the laws, customs, practices and institutions under which
 they live. And they can recognize and affirm these laws etc. because
 they in turn are the product of rational human subjects. For Hegel,
 it is historically the case in modern times that the <i>actual</i>
 customs, practices and institutions that shape the lives of subjects
 enjoy authority and deserve respect only in virtue of their underlying
 rationality. Laws, for instance, have to win acceptance insofar as
 they manifestly satisfy the interests of those subject to them.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 "The principle of the modern world requires that whatever is to be
 recognized by everyone must be seen by everyone as entitled to such
 recognition" (<i>EPR</i>, 355).
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
The situation in which we modern (i.e. post French-revolutionary,
post-Kantian) subjects find ourselves, is one in which many good
institutions have already been established through the historical and
cultural labor of spirit, but in which there is still a lot of work to
do, not least the intellectual task of recognizing what has already been
achieved. For the underlying rationality of actual institutions does not
lie on their surface; it is buried within them. This is why Hegel insists
that we modern subjects need not religion, but a Science of Right, the
task of which is to uncover and to make public the implicit rationality
of custom and law.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 "For what matters is to recognize in the semblance (Schein) of the
 temporal and transient the substance which is immanent and the eternal
 which is present" (<i>EPR</i>, 20).

<p>
Thus in Hegel's view philosophical metaphysics&#8212;the recognition of
the rational in the actual and, more broadly, the discrimination between
actuality and mere being&#8212;has an historical and social task to
fulfil. It is the task of perfecting the development of the objective
human spirit towards the ends of freedom and reconciliation&#8212;to
show Hegel's audience (in Berlin of the early 1820s) that they can be
"at home" in their world.

<b></b>

Beyond this, the modes of absolute spirit, art, religion and philosophy,
have the further task of making known that what is thus at home in the
world is spirit or mind, and that in recognizing the rational in the real,
self-knowing spirit recognizes nothing but itself.

2 Negativity and Immanent Criticism:<br />
Adorno's Inverted Hegelianism
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
I now want to locate the fundamental differences between Adorno's
philosophy and Hegel's. The most noticeable and obviously important
difference between Adorno's social philosophy and Hegel's is that Adorno
conceives immanent criticism as radically negative; it aims to condemn
existing unreason rather than to recognize and affirm the rational in
the actual. Typically, Adorno reaches this <i>prima facie</i> un-Hegelian
position not through a rejection of Hegel's ontotheology, but through a
dialectical inversion of it. According to Hegel actuality spreads out
along the axis of its underlying rationality, while "lazy" existence
tends when all goes well to lapse into non-existence. But Adorno realizes
that the fundamentally irrational institutions that in Hegel's eyes are
merely lazy have their own survival mechanisms, including the ability
to cloak themselves in the appearance of rationality. One example is the
institution of free wage labor which, though it serves only the dominant
interests of the capitalist class who exploit the free wage laborers by
appropriating the surplus value they produce, nonetheless appears to serve
the interests of all, including those who only have their labor power
to sell. Moreover, just as one actual institution, according to Hegel,
begets another, so, according to Adorno, one irrational institution tends
to beget another. The illusory reasons for the existence of one irrational
institution encourage other irrational institutions into being. Thus
consumer capitalism begets the leisure industry, which encourages people
to waste their free time pursuing inherently worthless activities, merely
in order to recreate their spent labor power, a process which in turn
fuels the economic system. Whilst Hegel believes that "lazy existence"
at worst hampers the development of actual institutions and hinders
the progress of spirit, Adorno urges that the influence of irrational
institutions is altogether more sinister and damaging.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 They destroy human freedom and erode the capacity to recognize and
 resist the advance of unfreedom. Indeed, Adorno contends that in
 consumer society the depredations of modern capitalism have pushed
 back the frontiers of actuality until virtually none remains. In
 the beginning of <i>Minima Moralia</i>, Adorno describes in horror
 a world in which "people who are no more than component parts of
 machinery act as if they still had the capacity to act as subjects,
 and as if something still depended on their actions" (<i>MM</i>,
 15). This is the reality of living in a "totally administered" and
 "radically evil" world.

<p>
This line of thought has led from a claim about the absence of actuality,
to one about the presence of radical evil, a move that requires some
explanation. Whether in his philosophical, sociological or his more
personal and anecdotal writings, Adorno never hesitates to use terms
like "evil" (das B&ouml;se), "absolute evil" (das B&ouml;se)(<i>DA</i>,
151/168), "the bad" (das Schlechte) (<i>ND</i>, 128 [122]) and "the
radically evil world" (die radikal b&ouml;se [Welt]) (<i>ND</i>, 374
[381]) and thus to take metaphysical (not to say theological) hostages
to fortune.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
There is a rather complicated story to tell here that links Adorno's use
of the term "radical evil" with Kant's in the <i>Religion Within the
Limits of Reason Alone</i>. Kant claims that evil is a metaphysical
property of the will, which explains people's apparently natural
predisposition voluntarily, through weakness, selfishness or wickedness,
to act heteronomously by pursuing ends given by sensible inclinations.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 For Adorno, evil refers to the widespread and systematic tendency for
 people to choose their own unfreedom by adjusting to and accepting
 socially given norms and by pursuing socially given ends.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Although both Kant and Adorno understand evil in terms of heteronomy
 or unfreedom, Adorno tends to attribute evil to the social mechanisms
 which encourage people to engage in heteronomous behavior, whilst
 Kant attributes evil to the deficiency of the individual's will,
 which predisposes him to overlook autonomous morality and to follow
 the promptings of inclination instead.

<p>
In general, Adorno appears to hover between two rather different views
of the endemic evil of the social world. The stronger, more pessimistic
view is that there is no good in the world, apart from the knowledge
that there is no good in the world. The weaker, less pessimistic view,
is that there are fragments of the good in the world&#8212;for example
the experience of pleasure granted by certain works of art, some kinds
of philosophical reflection, and certain spontaneous expressions of
human warmth and love&#8212;but only enough to allow us to notice their
absence from the social totality. They are the exception, not the rule,
of social reality; points of resistance to it, not its basis. Depending
on the context, Adorno slides between these two views. Common to both,
though, is the firm belief that the present situation is parlous.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Under such unpromising historical conditions the metaphysical project
metamorphoses. For Hegel, the task of philosophy was still to recognize
the rationality in the actual. But by Adorno's lights, a philosophy aimed
at recognizing the rational in the actual would be otiose: for there is no
(or virtually no) rational actuality.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Moreover, a philosophy whose task was to recognize the rational in
 present non-actual reality would be worse than otiose; it would be
 a false theodicy or ideological illusion, wholly complicit with the
 structures of domination it analysed. It would be a philosophy that
 offered spurious justifications for the existence of a fundamentally
 irrational reality. In order to avoid that fate, philosophy
 under present conditions must remain content with recognizing the
 irrationality at the heart of an antagonistic society; it must remain
 true to itself by contemplating not the true and the good, but the
 untrue and the bad.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What remains the same as itself, pure identity, is the bad. Mythical
fate is timeless. Philosophy was its slave, insofar as it, right up to
the theodicies of Leibniz and Hegel, interpreted the immutable, with
gargantuan euphemism, as the good. If one were to draw up an ontology
which accorded with the basic fact, which through constant repetition
becomes invariant, then that fact would be horror (das Grauen). (
<i>ND</i>, 128 [122])
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Accordingly, Adorno's philosophy not only has a different object to
Hegel's, it has the opposite social objective. Where Hegel seeks to
reconcile modern subjects to their world, by identifying the rational
in the actual, Adorno's ontology of the false state of things seeks to
alienate modern subjects from a social world that no longer merits

<b></b>

their recognition, by making them consciously unhappy with it. While the
task of Hegel's social philosophy is ultimately affirmative, the task
of Adorno's social philosophy is ultimately negative. Though it remains
within the same general metaphysical or ontotheological framework as
Hegel's, Adorno's social philosophy has the opposite evaluative polarity.

<p>
Now we are in a position to ask whether this most characteristic feature
of Adorno's philosophy&#8212;its negativity&#8212;can throw any light
on the normative basis of his social criticism. It is natural to think
that it might. Consider the view propounded both by Adorno and by many
of his critics that he is doing something called "immanent criticism,"
which needs no moral foundations and which is thus unlike external and
moralising criticism. On this view, what Adorno does is to show the
general and widespread assumption that the institutions and practices
that shape social life are good&#8212;that they in fact satisfy people's
fundamental interests&#8212;to be an illusion. Further, Adorno shows that
this illusion is necessary to the persistence of the social system. In
so doing, Adorno supposedly only measures presently existing society
against its own implicit normative or evaluative claims, but makes none
of his own. Therefore it is claimed that Adorno's criticism is not empty,
and the normative constraints it exerts are not external impositions on
the objects of criticism.

<p>
We can illustrate this minimal conception of immanent criticism with
an example. Adorno, like Marx, aims to show that although capitalist
relations of production appear to be a free and equal exchange of labor
power for wages, this appearance of equality is an illusion, due partly
to the nature of what is exchanged and partly to the circumstances under
which the exchange takes place. Adorno uncovers a kind of discrepancy
between social reality and people's understanding of it. He shows that
the appearance of capitalist exchange relations are deceptive, that both
parties are deceived about their true relation to each other, that they
believe "the lie of equality."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 He adds that neither party realizes the "injustice" of the exchange,
 and that this ongoing mutual deception maintains the practice and
 drives the process of the accumulation of capital, which ultimately
 blights both their lives.

<p>
One difficulty with the minimal conception is that it is vulnerable to
a version of G. E. Moore's open question argument. It leaves unanswered
the question whether or not this deceptive practice is <i>morally</i> bad
or wrong. Because it leaves that question open, the minimal conception
fails to square with Adorno's critical practice. For Adorno's writing
leaves us no doubt that the deceptive practice he criticizes is morally
reprehensible; i.e. that it <i>ought</i> not to be as it is. What this
suggests is that, contrary to widespread opinion, indeed contrary to
Adorno's self-estimation, Adorno's criticism is not wholly negative and
not wholly immanent. At any rate, the negativity of Adorno's conception
of criticism taken on its own, grants him no special dispensation to
draw normative conclusions from non-normative premises. Rather, what
entitles Adorno to the normative conclusions he <i>does</i> draw is the
obvious fact (a fact which is often ignored perhaps because it is so
obvious) that his negative conception of immanent criticism depends on
a metaphysical conception of radical evil.

<p>
This may seem controversial. Many contemporary commentators would
like Adorno to have no truck with any kind of metaphysics, let alone a
metaphysics of good and evil.

<b></b>

This seems to stem from the desire on the part of commentators to
make Adorno relevant to contemporary philosophical concerns by keeping
his metaphysical commitments as low as possible. Unlike Nietzsche and
Heidegger, however, Adorno does not think that metaphysics is something
that can or must be avoided at all costs. In the <i>Dialectic of
Enlightenment</i>, he and Horkheimer criticize Enlightenment thinking
for neutering rationalist metaphysics. They are far more scathing
about contemporary forms of nominalism and scientism. The latter
have abandoned all belief in universals and have lost the capacity to
"betray the injustice of what exists . . . through the incongruence
of concept and reality" (<i>DA</i>, 24, <i>DE</i>, 22-23). Presumably
this is what he thinks that he and Horkheimer are doing&#8212;betraying
present injustice by bringing to light the incongruence of concept and
object. In other words, Adorno admits that, despite the distance between
them, there is an affinity between critical theory and rationalist
metaphysics. Furthermore, the "injustice" of which Adorno speaks has
a normative dimension. The "injustice of what exists" is nothing less
than the failure of the positive concepts "good," "right," "fair,"
etc. to correspond to a reality that is radically evil.

<p>
To see this we need only consider the role that evil plays in Adorno's
qualified rehabilitation of metaphysics at the end of <i>Negative
Dialectics</i>. The "Meditations on Metaphysics" consists in a
contraposition of dialectical opposites: Kant's transcendent metaphysics
on the one hand and the event of Auschwitz on the other. According to
Kant, the ideas of reason correspond to nothing in experience, yet they
provide rational answers to questions that finite beings cannot help
but ask. To cut a long story short, the ideas of reason are like a set
of focal points ideally projected beyond the horizon of experience,
which provide practical orientation for finite beings in the world of
appearances. For Adorno, the significance of Kant's ideas is threefold:
they signify  that metaphysics is ineliminable from theory; 
that complete despair or nihilism is ultimately unthinkable, and 
that practice is prior to theory (<i>ND</i>, 375-77 [381-84]). On the
other hand, Adorno's meditations respond to the historical phenomenon of
Auschwitz. The re of Auschwitz in Adorno's work should be understood
as a synecdoche for the barbaric, inhuman, and ultimately murderous
treatment of millions of people that took place in the ghettos and the
concentration and death camps under the Third Reich. The significance of
Auschwitz, thus understood, is twofold: it represents the simultaneous
culmination and betrayal of enlightenment. Auschwitz is a betrayal
of enlightenment because it violated the humanitarian ideals of the
historical Enlightenment in an abhorrent and devastating manner. It is
the culmination of enlightenment because in that very devastation it
revealed what enlightenment always was: instrumental rationality run
wild, technological domination and social oppression masquerading as
reason and freedom. Adorno's strategy in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>
is to confront Kant's ideas and postulates&#8212;the empty promises
of enlightenment&#8212;with Auschwitz&#8212;the blind unreason of its
content. This confrontation is supposed to undermine Kant's rationalist
metaphysics and simultaneously to release its truth moment (<i>ND</i>,
400 [408]).

<p>
It turns out, then, that the minimal conception of immanent criticism
is both misleading as a picture of what Adorno is doing, and inadequate
as an explanation of the

<b></b>

normative basis of Adorno's own social criticism. The sense in which
Adorno's criticism is indeed negative is inseparable from the claim
that the world is radically evil. I would hesitate to call such a mode
of criticism "immanent." At very least I want to say that this version
of criticism is much richer than the minimal conception of immanent
criticism. For this reason, Adorno's metaphysics of radical evil is a
promising basis for further inquiry into the question of what is the
normative or evaluative basis of his social philosophy.

3 Mimesis, Rationality and Modern Art
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
So far, I have tried to show how in certain respects Adorno's underlying
metaphysics is a dialectical inversion of Hegel's ontotheological
project, but I have said virtually nothing about modern art. The general
discussion of Adorno's metaphysical project has, though, set the stage
for an understanding of Adorno's central thesis about the philosophical
significance of modern art. For Adorno the philosophical significance
of art lies in its capacity to embody and to disclose a certain kind of
metaphysical experience. He calls this capacity "mimesis." Throughout
his work, Adorno appeals to an original mimetic relation between thought
and things. His conception of mimesis is characteristically plastic, and
quite a lot of interpretative work is needed to uncover its philosophical
significance.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Here, rather than focusing on the general concept of mimesis, I want to
 draw attention to one of its particular instantiations, which Adorno
 calls the shudder (Schauder/Schauer), a term which occurs both in
 <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i> and <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>.

<p>
In the crucial opening section of the earlier work Adorno, drawing
heavily on studies in the history of religion and anthropology, develops
a conception of enlightenment thinking from a reconstructed prehistory
of rationality.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 Roughly speaking, Adorno divides human development into five stages,
 although the division is implicit rather than explicit, and the
 boundaries more vague than the following reconstruction suggests:

<p>
1. The first is a pre-animistic stage in which the world is governed by
a principle of mana which is primary and undifferentiated.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 Adorno says little about the structure of preanimistic society,
 apart from the fact that every member participated in the process of
 altering nature. He <i>does</i> say that mana is born from the shudder
 (Schauder) in the face of the unknown, and that it contains the germ
 of the division between subject and object, because according to the
 principle of mana things are not experienced directly as what they are,
 but as the seat of something else, mana.

<p>
2. In the second, <i>animistic</i> stage, human beings begin to populate
the world with named deities. Through language and the mimetic power of
magic they attempt to gain control of their environment. "The cry of fear,
with which the unfamiliar is experienced becomes its name. It fixes the
transcendence of the unknown over against the known, and thereby fixes
the shudder as something sacred" (<i>DA</i>, 17, <i>DE</i>, 15). Primitive
forms of thought thus distance the knower from the known and provide the
first doubling of nature into appearance (or illusion) and essence, which
provides the incipient basis first of myth and then of natural science.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 In so doing, language and magic give the class of priests and magicians
 privileged access to the supernatural

<b></b>

powers, and create a social hierarchy which from now on begins to entwine
itself around the relation of human beings to the world.

<p>
3. In the third stage myth, story-telling and collective memory emerge
as an inchoate form of rationality. Myths attempt to subdue the unknown
external world by imposing a kind of natural order upon its infinite
variety and unpredictability. However, the "repetition of nature"
which mythical symbols represent always turn out to be "the represented
permanence of social coercion"(<i>DA</i>, 23, 28, <i>DE</i>, 20, 27).

<p>
4. In the fourth stage, metaphysics replaces myth as the best means
of coming to understand and exert control over external nature. The
difference is that metaphysics uses universal concepts rather than stories
and images. Nonetheless these universals are just as much concealed
forms of domination as their precursors (<i>DA</i>, 23, <i>DE</i>,
21). But metaphysics retains a vestige of its social origins in so far
as it still aims at discovering a truth that transcends existent reality.

<p>
5. Finally, even metaphysics is overcome as enlightenment triumphs in the
form of an all-encompassing instrumental rationality, which is totally
in thrall to the status quo epistemically and politically. Adorno's
favorite examples are the natural sciences and the logical positivism of
the Vienna School. But almost any kind of formal system of reasoning,
from mathematics to logic, or any kind of technological application of
scientific knowledge, counts as an instance of enlightenment, since
their sole aim, according to Adorno, is to describe existent reality
and not to criticize it. Thus they end up slavishly subservient both
to external nature and to extant socio-economic relations. Ultimately
enlightenment gives up its quest for universal truths and lapses into a
quietistic form of nominalism: it recognizes only the existence of names,
of conceptually identified objects (<i>DA</i>, 24, <i>DE</i>, 23).
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
According to the anthropological story told here, the shudder arises as
the response to an originary imposition of non-identity. As befits the
origin of a dialectic, otherness (das Ungewohnte/Unbekannte) plays a dual
role in Adorno's thought: it is both the danger and the saving power of
modern life, the threat of extinction and the possibility of redemption.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The experience of shudder mirrors this dual structure. On the one
 hand the impulsive response of taking flight is a negative response
 to an unknown and potentially hostile other. It is the origin of
 what Horkheimer (following Weber) calls instrumental reason, and of
 what Adorno later calls identity-thinking. The distancing operation
 of conceptual, reflective thought is the means by which the subject
 attempts to subdue and tame the experience of shudder by controlling
 and mastering what provoked it. On the other hand the shudder is,
 epistemically speaking, a positive experience that is true to what
 is there prior to conceptual identification&#8212;the amorphous, the
 undifferentiated, the strange. It is an impulsive somatic experience
 that momentarily registers the presence of what occasions it. It thus
 stands in a more intimate relation to its other (to the non-identical)
 than concepts and categories do.

<p>
In <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>, Adorno appears to be making an
historical and anthropological claim that the shudder lies at the origins
of human rationality in the practices of magic.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 At the same time, though, he insists that these origins are
 irretrievable. There is no way back to primordial non-differentiation
 once reflection and

<b></b>

rationality have set in. At best, the shudder represents an
acknowledgement of a now lost and quite different relation to nature
than that of the knowing subject to the known object. In his later work,
Adorno extends his conception of the shudder. In <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>,
he claims that works of modernist art, in virtue of their characteristic
autonomy, can successfully capture and impart the shudder.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Here the shudder is not just a response to primal amorphousness and
 non-differentiation; it is the appropriate response to the abstract
 nature of modern life: "The shudder is a reaction to the cryptically
 shut, which is a function of that element of indeterminacy. At the
 same time however, the shudder is a mimetic comportment reacting
 mimetically to abstractness" (<i>AT</i>, 20). As we have seen the
 abstractness of modern life, its invariance, its universality, its
 (virtual) absence of particularity, its characteristic lifelessness,
 is what Adorno calls "the horror" (das Grauen).
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 The shudder is the involuntary and immediate reaction of revulsion,
 which discloses the modern administered world as radically evil.

<p>
This metaphysical claim provides the framework for Adorno's phenomenology
of modern art. In Adorno's view, works of art succeed only to the extent
that they defeat our cosy aesthetic expectations that they should occasion
pleasure. A successful work of modern art survives its assimilation to the
functional totality&#8212;its relegation to mere entertainment&#8212;by
becoming difficult, introverted, dissonant, shocking. At the same time, it
is a work of art and like all works of art has an ineliminable affirmative
moment, which Adorno (citing Baudelaire)calls "the promise of happiness."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 Modern artworks ironically fulfil this promise of happiness precisely
 by delaying and withholding the promised satisfaction. For example,
 Adorno claims, Sch&ouml;nberg's <i>Pierrot Lunaire</i> shows that "there
 is more joy in dissonance than in consonance" (<i>AT</i>, 40). The
 importance of Adorno's argument in <i>Aesthetic Theory</i> is that an
 admittedly rather narrow canon of modernist, avant-guarde works of art
 protect the weak flame of metaphysical experience, the experience of
 an alternative relation to things and to nature of which human beings
 have otherwise been deprived by the depredations of modern life.

4 Metaphysical Experience:<br />
Shudder as Inverted Wonder
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The shudder, then, is not just a mimetic reaction to primary,
undifferentiated otherness. It is also, and more importantly for our
purposes, a spontaneous and somatic response of revulsion at the world of
"universal fungibility," i.e. at a world which has been systematically
denuded of intrinsically valuable ends and activities, and in which
everything of value is only valuable as a means for something else. This
world of "universal fungibility," is the objective counterpart of the
concept of identity. To think conceptually is to subsume particulars under
a general concept. Qua instances of a more general concept, particulars
are made equal to, and infinitely substitutable for, one another.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 In <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, Adorno calls this kind of knowing
 "identity-thinking." All thought is conceptual, and conceptual
 thought is by its very nature identifying. This process of identifying
 particular things as tokens of more general types fixes and stabilizes
 meanings, rendering them more useful for the purpose of predicting
 and controlling nature. Adorno holds that this is the basic process
 behind the process

<b></b>

of reification, i.e. the domination of use-values by exchange-values
that is characteristic of the commodity form.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>

<p>
Even in this second sense the shudder is complex; it is not simply a
negative response of flight from reality. The shudder fulfils a positive
epistemic function. It is the gateway to the path of truth. The shudder
allows what is to disclose itself in truth as radically evil. It is the
form which metaphysical experience assumes under social conditions of
universal fungibility or total identity. Earlier, I argued against the
view that Adorno's social philosophy can be understood as a kind (the
minimal kind) of immanent criticism. There is, though, still a sense in
which Adorno's social criticism deserves to be called "immanent." Insofar
as it is form of normative or evaluative social criticism Adorno's
philosophy is nonetheless internal to what he calls metaphysical
experience, namely to a particular kind of somatic, non-conceptual,
experience of the world. As an experience of horror, of the radically evil
nature of the social world, it is essentially evaluative. It is, then, in
this sense a metaphysical theory, rather than a moral or ethical theory,
that provides the normative basis of his social theory. The relation
between the normative/evaluative and the metaphysical aspects of Adorno's
social philosophy becomes clearer once one understands the way in which
metaphysical experience connects with the conception of radical evil.

<p>
Earlier, I presented Adorno's metaphysics as a dialectical and axiological
inversion of Hegel's ontotheology. If we step back from Adorno's
interpretation of his own work, we can see how it reflects a tradition
of metaphysics much older and broader than the German Idealist tradition.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 For the present purpose I shall call this tradition <i>classical
 metaphysics</i>. I take the deliberately broad and rather vague
 term <i>classical metaphysics</i> to include a whole tradition of
 metaphysical thinking from Aristotle through to Hegel. <i>Classical
 metaphysics</i> understands itself as a philosophical theory of what
 is. Kant's transcendental idealist view of metaphysics as a doctrine
 of categories and of ideas and their relation to the empirical world
 is, on this view, a variant of classical metaphysics. Hegel sits more
 firmly within the tradition of <i>classical metaphysics</i> than does
 Kant, because he understands the dynamic interrelation of categories
 and ideas <i>to be the fundamental structure of reality in itself</i>.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 I shall assume that Aristotle's account of the origins of philosophy
 in book I of the <i>Metaphysics</i> is, in a very general way,
 emblematic of the whole tradition of <i>classical metaphysics</i>. In
 this well-known passage, Aristotle shows that philosophy and science
 originate in the experience of wonder/amazement (thauma) at the
 appearance of the world.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
For it is because of wondering that human beings first began to
philosophize and that they still do now . . . Now one who is perplexed
and amazed supposes that he is ignorant, (whence a lover of myths too
is a kind of philosopher), for myth is composed of wonders, so if they
indeed philosophized in order to avoid ignorance, it is clear that they
pursued knowledge for its own sake and not because of some use.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Classical metaphysics</i> in this account begins in the experience of
wonder and puzzlement at the appearance of the world. This experience
prompts the question "why" and sets in train the inquiry into first
causes and principles, a process of inquiry that traces

<b></b>

a path from ignorance to knowledge, in the course of which wonder and
puzzlement are replaced by the contrary state, understanding.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 It is important that the experience of wonder underlying classical
 metaphysics is not evaluatively innocent. Wonder is appropriately
 occasioned by what is worthy of it, at what is truly wondrous. Classical
 metaphysics is thus not neutral as regards the existence of the world:
 it holds that what exists is good, at least in the sense that it is
 worthy of contemplation.

<p>
When we compare Aristotle's account of the origin of classical metaphysics
with Adorno's account of the origin of rational thought in <i>Dialectic of
Enlightenment</i>, some striking and important parallels emerge. Adorno's
story of the origins of enlightenment thinking is not so much an
historical account of the genesis of rational thought, as an account of
the grounds on which rational thought is based. Like Aristotle, Adorno
holds that philosophy and more broadly conceptual thought arises from
and is based on a kind of originary experience of the world. Adorno's
notion of metaphysical experience resembles Aristotle's also in that
it is also not evaluatively innocent. The significant difference is
that Adorno's philosophy arises from and is based on the metaphysical
experience of a corrupt and debased world: in the aftermath of the Third
Reich, and of the reifying effects of consumer capitalism, the world no
longer gives rise to <i>thauma</i>. On the contrary, as Adorno makes
clear in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, the false ontology, the reality
of a totally administered world, is a kind of horror epitomized by the
death camps. Shudder, then, is a response arising from the metaphysical
experience of a world characterised by horror (das Grauen). Shudder
is the equivalent in the modern, disenchanted, capitalist world of the
classical metaphysical experience of wonder: it is the gateway to the
path of truth; but the truth to which it leads is the awful one that
the social world is radically evil.

<p>
Adorno thinks that the world is not wondrous, but that even if it were,
human beings would not be capable of wondering at it. For human subjects
have been so homogenized and stupified by mass culture, their subjectivity
has been so reified by exchange relations, so stultified by rampant
consumerism, that their capacity to experience wonder has atrophied.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 (Of course, because the world is not wondrous anyway, their incapacity
 for wonder is not a detectable problem.) But the situation is worse
 than that. The modern subject's capacity to shudder has been all but
 eroded. In <i>Aesthetic Theory</i>, Adorno claims that the albeit
 self-inflicted damage to our rational and sensible capacities is so
 extensive that even the human capacity for shudder, the capacity
 to experience the true <i>horror</i> of the world for what it is,
 may disappear.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 In which case our only access to the truth will disappear with it.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If at one time human beings in their powerlessness against nature
feared the shudder as something real, the fear is no less intense,
no less justified, that the shudder will dissipate. All enlightenment
is accompanied by the anxiety that what set enlightenment in motion
in the first place and what enlightenment ever threatens to consume,
may disappear: truth. (
<i>AT</i>, 80)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Fortunately, Adorno thinks that the capacity for shudder has not yet been
<i>completely</i> extinguished from human life. One reason why Adorno
values modern art so highly is that when all goes well it manages to
preserve and to communicate the shudder

<b></b>

even under social conditions that militate against experiences of
truth. Whilst this is so, it is the primary task of philosophy to
interpret that metaphysical experience, and thus to keep alive the
possibility of true social criticism. In this respect the shudder has
a positive epistemic and practical significance for Adorno.

<!--_a-head-->
5 Metaphysical Experience and Bourgeois Coldness
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The metaphysical role of shudder as inverted wonder provides a clue to
the normative/evaluative basis of Adorno's social criticism. Metaphysical
experience is an experience of reality interpreted mimetically into
the appropriate evaluative reaction. The two moments of experience and
interpretation are coeval and reciprocal. In Adorno's view what experience
delivers is always already moralized or evaluated. There are no neutral
facts that are not already morally or evaluatively interpreted. Adorno's
view is very different from the Kantian picture he attacks, in which the
moral will imposes order on an external manifold of sensibility. According
to the Kantian picture, the moral value of an action consists solely in
its being an expression of the pure rational will. A particular action has
value insofar as the maxim on which it is based is universally applicable
and insofar as the maxim is adopted in virtue of its universal form. For
Adorno, by contrast, moral rules are at best ancillary. What is paramount
are the underlying goods the rules protect and the evils they prohibit. At
worst the rules themselves are part of the problem.

<p>
Adorno's chief complaint against Kant is not that his moral theory is
phenomenologically inaccurate. On the contrary, Adorno accepts that
Kant's theory is a correct description of the historical phenomenon
of <i>bourgeois</i> morality, but he thinks that there is something
deeply wrong with that very morality. He thinks that Kantian moral
agents, because they are required (or require themselves) to follow
universalizable rules and to act in conformity with and out of duty,
become detached from and indifferent to the underlying goods the rules
protect and the underlying evils they prohibit.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
 Ultimately, their moral sensibilities are blunted. They become
 insensitive, cold, indifferent to things and to one another. Adorno
 thinks this weakness in Kantian morality is evidenced by the moral
 catastrophe in Germany under the Third Reich. The "coldness" or
 "indifference" of law abiding, middle-class German citizens contributed
 to the collective hemorrhaging of their moral sensibility, and helped
 turn ordinary individuals into Hitler's blind followers and willing
 executioners. As he puts it in <i>Negative Dialectics</i>, coldness is
 "the basic principle of bourgeois subjectivity . . . without which
 Auschwitz would not have been possible" (<i>ND</i>, 356 [363];
 <i>CM</i>, 201).

<p>
In spite of his criticisms and reservations about Kant's conception of
ethics, however, Adorno firmly believes both that Kantianism is true of
<i>bourgeois morality</i>, and that moral theory just is Kantianism. He
does not have any alternative moral outlooks or moral theories clearly in
view. Instead of exploring the resources of alternative moral theories, he
looks for an alternative to moral theory. In <i>Negative Dialectics</i>,
Adorno tries, with limited success, to make a critical engagement
with Kant's epistemology serve as this alternative. He attempts not to
revitalise but to overcome Kantian moral

<b></b>

theory by reconnecting it with somatic and immediate experience:
"One ought not to torture: there ought to be no concentration camps. . . These sentences are only true as impulses, when it is reported that
somewhere torture is taking place. They should not be rationalised. As
abstract principles they lapse into the bad infinity of their derivation
and validity" (<i>ND</i>,281 [285]; <i>CM</i>, 202). For Adorno, these
imperatives <i>only</i> have determinate content as immediate responses to
concrete and particular instances of injustice. As such they lack the kind
of natural-scientific lawlikeness that Kant attributes to moral laws: they
are not valid a priori in the way in which Kant thinks all laws must be.

<p>
It is not entirely clear here what position Adorno is arguing for here. It
could be a kind of Rousseauan revaluation of the sentiments. But if so,
it is surely too much to expect that impulses, feelings, etc., simply by
virtue of being unmediated and untainted by reflection and rationality,
will reliably connect with good and evil. Anyway, as we have seen,
Adorno holds that reflection and rationality bar the route back to
immediate experience, so Rousseauanism is not an option. Still it is in
general correct to see Adorno's project as one of reconnecting human
reason&#8212;via the channels of metaphysical experience, especially
the receptive channels of impulses and feelings&#8212;with the goods
the moral laws were supposed to protect. This is all the more daunting,
given that reason, which is itself deeply implicated in the problem of
coldness, cannot be the guiding force of the educative process. Recall
that the goods that Adorno in his more optimistic moments concedes are
still there&#8212;spontaneity, human warmth and affection, sympathy,
artistic beauty, etc.&#8212;are dwindling as identity-thinking in the
shape of scientific and technological advance, consumer capitalism and the
culture industry increasingly determines patterns of human behavior and
thought. Worse still, if Adorno is right, the ideological manipulation
of human sensibility has damaged our ability to detect and respond to
such goods as remain.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 Thus, the present parlous situation cannot be remedied simply
 by educating people to love and to want those goods. Things have
 deteriorated well past the point at which Schiller's idea of an
 aesthetic re-education of sensibility may still have provided a
 solution.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 In "Education after Auschwitz," Adorno laments people's general
 inability to love as well as their general unworthiness to be loved. In
 particular, he notes the failure of the Christian religion to reform
 the coldness or indifference of the bourgeois social order by preaching
 human love and warmth.

<p>
Adorno appreciates these difficulties. He concludes that "the first thing
therefore is to bring coldness to the consciousness of itself, of the
reasons why it arose" (<i>CM</i>, 202). Given the present, disastrous
circumstances the first and most pressing task for philosophy is to
enable subjects to recognize the underlying context of evil. This is
exactly where the shudder, and modern art's peculiar ability to embody
and express it, becomes relevant. Adorno still clings to the belief that
in spite of ideological distortions and the manipulation of sensibility
human subjects have an intuitive ability to detect evil; they know a bad
thing when they see it. Thus, in <i>Problems of Moral Philosophy</i>, he
claims that the "critique of the administered world" must take the form
of "the concrete denunciation of the inhuman." We are in a position to
make such criticisms, he avers, because, even whilst we have no positive
normative conception of humanity

<b></b>

and no positive conception of "absolute goods" and "absolute norms,"
we nonetheless all can and do know intuitively what inhumanity is
(<i>PDM</i>, 260-61 [175]).
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 The normative aim of his social theory is to make people aware of and
 to respond appropriately to the underlying evil, which they have formed
 and which has formed them.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
6 The Fact of Auschwitz
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Of course, it is all too easy to say that the shudder discloses social
reality as radically evil. The question is how does it do this? What
makes it into a reliable mechanism of disclosure? The shudder faces
the same problem as haunts the impulses, and sentiments. How does one
know one is shuddering at the appropriate actions or situations? What
is the basis of Adorno's confidence in it? If Adorno thought on more
Habermasian lines, he might appeal to the criterion of agreement. On such
a view what makes the act of shuddering, say at a particular instance of
gratuitous cruelty, appropriate is the very fact that other things being
equal everyone shudders at that act. But this is not Adorno's view. Given
the homogenizing effect of the ideological illusions propagated by mass
culture, the mere fact that everyone shudders at certain acts, even if
true, is no reliable indication of evil. It may simply reflect a craven
desire for conformity in judgment&#8212;the simple desire not to be out of
step with everyone else. Besides, there simply is no widespread agreement
about the more recondite and contestable normative judgments of Adorno's
social theory, say, that DIY is a depraved form of pseudo-activity,
or that sport is just covert training for work, or that "light music"
is iniquitous. Mere agreement in judgment cannot vouchsafe the truth of
these particular judgments.

<p>
In fact Adorno holds something much closer to the opposite view, namely
that torture and genocide are appropriate objects of shudder because
they are objectively wrong. The criterion of appropriateness is the very
presence of wrongdoing, the existence of evil. Adorno is, after all,
I think, a kind of moral realist.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 I offer two pieces of evidence for this claim. Firstly, Adorno makes
 frequent gestures towards a "materialist" morality, and he does so
 in part because the experience of shudder is a response to something
 other than and independent of itself, to something real. Secondly,
 Auschwitz is the paradigmatic instance of secular evil and Adorno
 obviously does not think that widespread spontaneous revulsion at
 what happened at Auschwitz is what makes it morally wrong. On the
 contrary the evil that Auschwitz objectively is, is what makes the
 shudder appropriate. In fact the re of Auschwitz is the keystone
 of the normative framework of Adorno's social philosophy. This can be
 seen from his remark in the "Meditations on Metaphysics": "Hitler has
 imposed on humankind in the condition of its unfreedom a new categorical
 imperative: to order their thought and actions such that Auschwitz never
 reoccur, nothing similar ever happen" (<i>ND</i>, 358 [365]). Adorno
 certainly means that Auschwitz is objectively wrong, although this
 feeble categorisation is inadequate to the evil it categorises. Adorno
 denies, however, that what made Auschwitz morally wrong is that it
 violated an antecedent moral law. It would be "heinous," he writes,
 to attempt to justify this imperative conceptually.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 Auschwitz res

<b></b>

in Adorno's work as an historical landmark of secular evil, which,
not least because it exceeds and confounds any attempt to understand
its wrongness as a violation of a law, serves as a memorial and
orientation point for metaphysical contemplation. Auschwitz is the fact
of unreason. It requires neither justification nor explanation. Everyone
<i>ought</i> simply to be able to see that Auschwitz is wrong, to feel
the evil that it is. There is nothing to say to someone who cannot,
apart from that their moral sensibility is defective.

<p>
There are two theses here: that the presence of evil is the criterion for
the appropriateness of the shudder; and that Auschwitz is the paradigm
instance of evil. In my view these two theses support the normative
framework of Adorno's social philosophy.

<p>
But this interpretation seems to leave Adorno open to an obvious
objection. It might be plausible for Adorno to suggest that the objective
wrongness of Auschwitz is simply there to be seen; but it is surely
implausible to say that the wrongness of DIY, light music, television,
spectator sports, or jazz is similarly there to be seen. On what grounds
then does he condemn them? Adorno need not claim that these apparently
trifling and harmless components of modern consumer culture are bad per se
and can be known to be bad per se. Adorno need only claim, and indeed does
claim, that Auschwitz is bad per se and can be known to be bad per se. At
the same time, Auschwitz is the result of the tendency of enlightenment
(or identity-thinking) to instrumentalize all relations to others and to
reduce all forms of thinking to the formal calculation of the efficiency
of means. Auschwitz is the culmination of the functionalization of
the social order that ensues when instrumental modes of behavior and
identifying modes of thinking get out of control. Adorno's strategy is to
show that those aspects of cultural and social life that have adapted to
the functionalized social order, even those which fail to resist it, are
complicit with that order. DIY, spectator sports, light music, television
and jazz all lie somewhere on the slippery slope towards the total
elimination of freedom and individuality; they thus condemn themselves
by analogy to the social mores of the Third Reich and to the culture of
Nazism that failed to prevent and in that sense led to Auschwitz.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
On the interpretation I am offering, Adorno's social philosophy implicitly
relies on this kind of analogical argument to give it the considerable
normative force it has. I take it that such arguments are consistent
with Adorno's theoretical practice, if not with every detail of his
own methodological self-understanding. Adorno's conception of radical
evil can be made intelligible and plausible through the real historical
example of Auschwitz, the perpetration on an unprecedented scale of the
kind of violence and mutilation that matters most, physical violence
to other human beings. The new categorical imperative testifies that
Adorno believed that such secular evil might well reoccur. The same
fear haunts his writings on education. Adorno does not make autonomy
(M&uuml;ndigkeit) into the aim of all education after Auschwitz because he
believes it to be a fundamental good, but because he believes that under
present circumstances it is the only human virtue, the exercise of which
may at least prevent the reoccurrence of such evil. Thus Adorno claims:
"The single genuine power standing against the principle of Auschwitz is
<i>M&uuml;ndigkeit</i>, if I might use the Kantian expression: the power
of self-determination, of not cooperating" (<i>CM</i>, 195). Only those
individuals who can think for themselves and who have the capacity for
critical self-reflection 


<b></b>

stand a chance of resisting integration into
the functional order and of escaping the relapse into barbarism.

<p>
If my interpretation is correct, there is heavy empirical and sociological
burden on Adorno's social philosophy. His analysis of society must
convincingly demonstrate the thoroughgoing similarities between the
microstructure of post-war consumer culture in America and Europe and
the features of bourgeois culture that allowed Auschwitz to happen. It
is hard to see how it can bear that weight. From our present perspective,
three decades after Adorno's death, it seems implausible that he pursues
those analogies right into the apparently trifling and harmless details
of everyday life. This may explain why commentators are so ready
to interpret these analogies as nothing more serious than ingenious
rhetorical exaggerations. In my view, by contrast, when Adorno in his
essay "On the Fetish character in Music and the Regression of Listening"
compares the cult of the conductor to that of the <i>F&uuml;hrer</i>,
when he claims in the <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i> that enlightenment
"behaves towards things as a dictator behaves towards people; it knows
them insofar as it can manipulate them," and when he compares jazz
enthusiasts to the blind followers of totalitarian regimes, he means
it literally.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 The exaggerations are not only meant to be true, they are not strictly
 speaking even exaggerations. The claims of Adorno's social philosophy
 may be outlandish, but he believed its outlandishness to be commensurate
 with and justified by the extremity of the extant evil. Deflationary
 interpretations do Adorno a disservice by interpreting these apparent
 analogies between Nazism and the consumer culture of America and
 later of West Germany as stylistic exaggerations of more modest and
 empirically defensible claims. To my mind, this domesticates and
 trivializes Adorno's real concerns and, instead of making his social
 criticism relevant, robs it of its normative basis.

<p>
I do not deny that Adorno, as a German-Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute;,
may have had very compelling psychological motives for judging Western
capitalist culture in the way he did. Nor do I mean to underestimate
how closely American society may have resembled the Third Reich in
certain respects during the McCarthy era and the Cold War. It is Adorno's
considerable achievement to have paid rigorous critical attention to the
minute, unobvious cultural conditions of political and social catastrophe.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 Nevertheless, I think it obvious that the normative force of Adorno's
 social philosophy relies heavily on an alleged network of subtle and
 sinister analogies between Western consumer culture and the Fascism
 of Nazi Germany, many of which cannot be sustained.

7 Conclusion:<br />
Metaphors of the Absent Good
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The normative basis of Adorno's social philosophy as I have presented
it, depends on two reciprocal and mutually supporting moments: the
re of Auschwitz and the mimetic response of shudder at the horror
of pure identity. These two moments support a framework of arguments
by analogy between the cultural conditions of the elimination of
freedom that ultimately led to the murder of millions of people,
and to cultural conditions of unfreedom in Western consumer culture
that, in Adorno's estimation, threaten to do the same. If I am right,
commentators who attempt to deduce Adorno's 

<b></b>

ethics from his aesthetics,
and critics of Adorno who look for normative ethical assumptions smuggled
in under the cloak of his aesthetics, are looking for the wrong thing
in the wrong place. The answer to the question of the evaluative or
normative basis of Adorno's social philosophy is to be found in his
metaphysical views concerning the existence of secular evil. Moreover,
Adorno's social philosophy, as I have presented it, is consistent with
his philosophical allegiance to Hegel. It is a development of Hegelian
metaphysics. Specifically, it is a dialectical and axiological inversion
of Hegel's thesis that the task of philosophy is to comprehend the
rational in the actual. In turn, this inverted Hegelianism fits within
the broader framework of classical metaphysics which undergoes a further
axiological inversion at Adorno's hands.

<p>
Whilst my interpretation of Adorno here yields a relatively simple
solution to the question of the normative basis of his social philosophy,
it may also be thought to lead to an unpalatable consequence. On
my interpretation, the shudder is the only appropriate response to
Auschwitz. More than that, it is a complex mimetic response in which
negative elements and positive epistemic and practical elements are
intertwined. But this interpretation saddles Adorno with the uncomfortable
implication that Auschwitz&#8212;the paradigm instance of horror&#8212;has
after all some positive, redemptive significance.

<p>
In fact, Adorno can and does face this consequence squarely. Auschwitz is
the historical manifestation of the horror of pure identity. According
to the logic of Adorno's negative dialectic pure identity passes over
into pure non-identity and back again. These two moments, identity and
non-identity stand in perpetual tension. They are not secured within a
more overarching identity as in Hegel's logic. There is then a kind of
non-identity to the re of Auschwitz in Adorno's philosophy, with a
potentially redemptive significance. Auschwitz is a secular evil of such
magnitude that it shatters our moral categories and exceeds our attempts
to comprehend it as the mere violation of antecedent moral laws. This
positive aspect of the shudder consists partly in (but is not exhausted
by) its epistemic significance, namely in the apprehension of the truth
that the world is radically evil. In <i>Minima Moralia</i>, Adorno cites
F. H. Bradley, "Where everything is bad, it must be good to know the
worst" (<i>MM</i>, 83). It is good to know the worst not just because
it is good to have true beliefs. There is a more subtle dialectic in
play. Not even Auschwitz, the ultimate horror, warrants the response of
total despair. Adorno is a brinksman, but he is not a nihilist. So long as
we can know the worst&#8212;that what is, is radically evil&#8212;then not
everything can be irredeemably bad. That is because truth is, in Adorno's
eyes, not just a relation of correspondence to the facts, but, as it is
for Plato, the source of illumination that radiates from the good.

<p>
Adorno does not provide any philosophical discussion of the constellation
of truth, evil and goodness. Instead he has recourse to an intriguing
metaphor in the crucial final section of <i>Negative Dialectics</i>
of a colorless light source, made visible and present only through its
scattered and refracted traces.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Consciousness could not despair over the grey, if it did not harbour the
concept of a different colour whose scattered traces are not absent from
the negative whole. (
<i>ND</i>, 370 [377-78])

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
It is what is possible, never what is immediately actual that blocks
off utopia: thus in the midst of existence what is possible appears to
be abstract. The inextinguishable colour comes from non-being. Thought
serves it, a bit of existence which, negative as always, reaches over
to non-existence. Only the utmost distance would be nearness; philosophy
is the prism which captures its colour. (
<i>ND</i>, 66 [57])
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As metaphors are apt to be, they are more suggestive than conclusive. They
suggest that the good is a source of illumination, invisible apart from
what it falls upon; grey (das Grau) suggests the horror (das Grauen)
of extant evil; philosophy is the prism that scatters the traces of
color; and the colors are the present traces of the absent good. The
suggestion is that philosophical truth is ineliminably related, through
the presence of secular evil, to a good that is at once transcendent and
absent. Here Adorno's criticism decisively departs from Hegel. The color
and the greyness are situated within the existing world. Philosophy,
in its pursuit of truth, tries to think the possibilities that are lit
up by the inextinguishable and invisible light source located on the far
side of the threshold between being and non-being. In this metaphor of
goodness, Adorno is thinking, not with Hegel, but against him, not only in
the manner of his presentation, but in the theological insistence on the
transcendence of the absent good. These metaphors suggest that the evil
we can know always stands in relation to a good that we cannot, and that
the pursuit of truth, even an awful one, is therefore never a worthless
exercise. The irony is that even here, in these metaphors of transcendent
goodness, where Adorno consciously and decisively breaks with Hegel,
there remains an inverse symmetry which testifies that Adorno remains
Hegel's faithful pupil. In his lectures on the history of philosophy
Hegel writes with characteristic provocation that Plato's idea of the
good "is not beyond reality, in heaven . . . the idea is just reality
brought nearer." (<i>W</i> 19: 39) For Adorno, by contrast, the presence
of the evil we can know shows the idea of the good to be remote indeed,
however "only the utmost distance would be nearness" (<i>ND</i>, 66 [57]).

In 1951, Adorno published <i>Minima Moralia: Reflections on a Damaged
Existence</i>, an ensemble of micro-dialectical reflections on the good
life in a post-war consumer society that was, in his view, increasingly
emptied not only of goodness but of vitality. See the Dedication
and the epigraph '"Life does not live' Ferdinand K&uuml;rnberger,"
<i>Minima Moralia</i> (London: Verso 1991), 15-19, hereafter cited
as <i>MM</i>. In 1963, he held a lecture course entitled <i>Probleme
der Moralphilosophie</i>, ed. T. Schr&ouml;der (Frankfurt am Main:
Suhrkamp, 1996), henceforth abbreviated as <i>PDM</i>. This has recently
been translated into English as, <i>Problems of Moral Philosophy</i>,

I do not mean moral "autonomy" in Kant's sense, a concept Adorno subjects
to criticism. I mean something more like <i>M&uuml;ndigkeit</i>,
which is sometimes misleadingly translated as "maturity," but means
the capacity to use one's own reason. Adorno takes the term from Kant's
essay "An Answer to the Question 'What is Enlightenment?'" Immanuel Kant,
<i>Political Writings</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991),
54. See my note no. 18 in "Adorno on the Ethical and the Ineffable,"

of freedom, illuminated by Adorno's interest in psychoanalysis and
social-psychology. Similarly, the 1963 lectures on moral philosophy
contain surprisingly little engagement with the long tradition of moral
philosophy.

<p>
<a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>.
In this essay I shall make no distinction between the normative and
the evaluative. What I say pertains just as much to Adorno's use of
normative moral concepts such as "right" and "wrong" as it does to his
use of evaluative ethical concepts such as "good" and "bad." The same
problem besets Adorno's conception of the good as besets his conception
of the right.

Roughly, we can call a criticism "moralizing" if it presupposes a prior

<a name="FOOT10" href="#REF10">10</a>.
Hegel's immediate targets here are Plato's recommendations on childcare
and Fichte's unnervingly prescient prescription that criminals should
carry a painted likeness of themselves on their passports, so that they
can be identified at all times. Hegel's point is that the science of right
can do without making such particular and determinate prescriptions. Such
details form part of what he deems to be the "brightly coloured covering"
(bunte Rinde) of the appearance of actuality, not its underlying
rationale.

<p>
<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
Shierry Weber Nicholson, translator of Adorno's <i>Hegel: Drei
Studien</i>, refers to Hegel's teaching of the "rationality of the
real." See <i>Hegel: Three Studies</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993),
85. This is an accurate translation of Adorno's very uncharitable
interpretation of Hegel's notorious <i>Doppelsatz</i> as the mere
"justification of what exists" (des Seienden), 82 &amp; 85, but it should
not be mistaken for Hegel's view. Despite Adorno's affinity with Hegel,
he uncritically inherits the conflation of actuality and existence,
along with the conservative and quietistic interpretation of Hegel this
implies. Together they give a very misleading impression of Hegel's
philosophy, albeit one which was widespread among both Old and Young
Hegelians, and which later became more or less standard within Marxism.

To take a recent example from British political life, whilst the House
of Lords may be said to exist for a reason, namely as a check on the
legislation passed by the House of Commons, the hereditary principle
does not. There is no reason at all in the 21st century why occupants
of the second chamber should be born into this office.

<p>
<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
A good example are the cold weather payments which have, due to a decision
of the High Court, found their way into the institution of the British
welfare state. If there is good reason to issue cold weather payments to
women over sixty, there is equally good reason to issue the same payment
to men over sixty, and not only to men over sixty-five.

<p>
<a name="FOOT15" href="#REF15">15</a>.
I have taken up and adapted this way of thinking about Hegel's metaphysics
from Raymond Geuss, whose essays on modern German philosophy in
<i>Morality, Culture, Spirit</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1999) are unrivalled in their perspicuous presentation of difficult ideas.

<p>
<a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>.
The term "theodicy" comes form Leibniz who argues that God's perfection
is such that this world, although it contains evil, is the best world
that it was possible for God to create, because the evil in it is always
accompanied by a greater good. See <i>Leibniz: Selections</i>, ed. Phillip
Wiener (New York: C. Scribner &amp; Sons, 1951), 509-22. This doctrine
is better known for having been mercilessly and unfairly lampooned by
Voltaire in <i>Candide</i> as Dr. Pangloss's panacea that, "all is for
the best in the

<b></b>

best of all possible worlds." (<i>Candide</i>, ed. J. H. Brumfitt,
[Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978, <i>passim</i>]).

<p>
<a name="FOOT17" href="#REF17">17</a>.
In Hegel's eyes, organized religion, predominantly Christianity, has
done most to promulgate this false theodicy. For the Christian religion
has made us think that this world is simply a trial and preparation for
another kingdom, in which our true interests will be satisfied. <i>W</i>,
19: 501. "On the appearance of Christianity it is initially claimed that:
'My kingdom is not of this world.' But the realization of this kingdom
has and ought to transpire in the present world. In other words, laws,
customs, constitutions and everything that belongs to the actuality of
spiritual consciousness should be made rational." See Hegel, <i>History
of Philosophy III</i>, transl. Haldane and Simpson (London: Routledge
and Kegan Paul, 1963 [1892]), 21-22.

Hegel uses the terms "bei sich" and "zu Hause sein." This quotation is
actually taken from theAddition to &#167;4, which is transcribed from the
manuscripts of Hotho and Gans. The words are not by Hegel's own hand,
but they are deemed to be a reliable source. See Translator's Preface,

<p>

Hegel thought that in ancient times by contrast the law commanded respect
and veneration in virtue of its mere existence. To illustrate this, he
adduces lines 456-57 of the <i>Antigone</i> by Sophocles, lines that
are spoken by the eponymous heroine. "The heavenly commands are not
from yesterday or today, no they are eternal and nobody knows whence
they came." Hegel <i>W</i> 12: 56. Sophocles <i>The Theban Plays</i>,
transl. E. F. Watling (London: Penguin 1988), 138. See also Hegel,
<i>W</i> 3: 322. "Thus, Sophocles in his Antigone acknowledges as
the gods of unwritten and infallible right (Recht): 'not just today
and yesterday but forever/ they are there, and no-one knows when they
appeared.'" <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, transl. A. V. Miller (Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 1977), 261. As Hegel saw it, the main problem of
ancient Greek political life was to make good laws and to establish good
institutions. There apart, political life in Ancient Greece was all the
more straightforward because the Greeks implicitly recognized the mere
existence of institutions and laws. However, Socrates interrupts and
corrupts this happy na&iuml;vete of Greek ethical life, by introducing
into it the principle of critical reflection. Indeed, Hegel believes
that, in no small measure because of the modernizing effects of world
historical res like Socrates, the naive recognition of the mere
existence of customs and laws is no longer possible for modern agents,
who, because they are all critical and reflective, recognize only what
conforms to their reason as having authority over them. The lives of
modern subjects are based on recognition of the <i>reasons</i>for the
existence of institutions.

The passage occurs in the addition to &#167;317. See also the interesting
passage in the introduction to Hegel's lectures on fine art. (Hegel,
<i>W</i> 13: 25): "The reflective culture of our life today make it a
necessity for us in respect of our will no less than of our judgment to
adhere to general points of view and to regulate particular matters
according to them, so that universal forms, laws, duties, maxims
are what have validity as grounds of determination and are the chief
regulative force." Hegel, <i>Introductory Lectures on Aesthetics</i>,

<p>
<a name="FOOT22" href="#REF22">22</a>.
Hegel, <i>W</i> 13: 10, 11 &amp; 17. Notice that Hegel does not say
that the task of philosophy is to create good institutions. That is a
matter for concrete historical practice, which precedes the reflective
task of historical comprehension. In his own time, Hegel endorsed the
reforms undertaken by Stein, Hardenberg, Humboldt, and Altenstein, and
identified these relatively liberal institutions as the <i>actuality</i>
of the Prussian State.

<p>
<a name="FOOT23" href="#REF23">23</a>.
Hegel is not unaware of this. He admits that the accumulation of wealth
leads to the impoverishment of a whole class of people. And he concedes
that the inner logic of civil society leads to the establishing of
colonies. Hegel, <i>EPR</i>, 265-67.

<p>
<a name="FOOT27" href="#REF27">27</a>.
Hauke Brunkhorst makes the mistake of not taking Adorno's claim that the
world is radically evil at face value. For example he interprets the
dictum that there is no right way to live a false life to mean "only
that there is no entirely true life in a false life," in other words,
that under present circumstances there is no entirely good way to live a
life. That is an uninteresting and uncontroversial claim, and not what
Adorno is arguing. In the next paragraph, Brunkhorst's interpretation
of Adorno shifts significantly. He attributes to Adorno the claim that
"true life," is not possible "in the case of a completely false life,"
but that a human life that is at least not misspent is nonetheless
still imaginable. This is consistent with the stronger view I have
outlined. Finally, two lines later, Brunkhorst attributes a third
position to Adorno, namley the view that "the damaged life <i>is not
yet</i> the completely false life." This is now more like the weaker
view outlined here. H. Brunkhorst, <i>Adorno and Critical Theory</i>
(Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1999), 64.

<p>
<a name="FOOT28" href="#REF28">28</a>.
For just this reason, Adorno rejects empirical approaches
to sociology. "For the object itself is derivative, secondary,
superficial. Because today the subjects are objects of society, not its
substance." (Adorno, <i>Gesammelte Schriften in zwanzig B&auml;nden</i>,
Vol. 14, ed. R. Tiedemann (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1970-86),
398-99. Henceforth abbreviated as <i>GS</i>. This is an inversion of
Hegel's doctrine in the <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>that "substance is
subject," which is just another way of saying that the world basically
consists in rational actuality.

<p>
<a name="FOOT29" href="#REF29">29</a>.
Michael Theunissen observes that the concept of negativity with which
Adorno constructs his dialectic is not the formal negativity of non-being
but rather "the ontic negativity of what ought not to be," namely "the
bad which can only be addressed as false, because he has a concept of
untruth which picks out bad reality." Theunissen, "Negativit&auml;t bei

The title of the opening fragment, "Begriff der Aufkl&auml;rung," must be

This is implied by the claim that this early principle survives in Greek

<p>
<a name="FOOT36" href="#REF36">36</a>.
Adorno, like Heidegger before him, alludes to H&ouml;lderlin's ode
"Patmos": "Wo aber Gefahr ist, w&auml;chst das Rettende auch" (Where
there is danger, the saving power increases, too), (<i>DA</i>, 45,

I differ from critics like Jay Bernstein who elucidate Adorno's concept
of metaphysical experience with the help of Hegel and Benjamin. Bernstein
interprets metaphysical experience as a relation of self-recognition
in otherness that obtains when one beholds an art-work appropriately,
and which provides an example of a non-instrumental and non-subsumptive
relation to other things and other persons, which has substantive ethical
implications. J. M. Bernstein, "Why Rescue Semblance? Metaphysical
Experience and the Possibility of Ethics," in <i>Adorno's Aesthetic
Theory</i>, ed. Lambert Zuidervaart (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press 1997),
177-212. What worries me about Bernstein's approach, insofar as it is not
just an exposition but an endorsement of Adorno's philosophy, is that,
at bottom, an aesthetic experience is an experience of an object, and
thus does not provide an appropriate model for thinking about ethical
relations, which are essentially relations between persons.

Not for nothing is Hegel sometimes viewed as the Aristotle of the modern
world. I am leaving aside the central scholarly question of whether the
difference between Hegel's and Kant's metaphysics is a difference within
the Kantian paradigm or a difference from it.

Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i> I 2.982b, 10-20. I have altered W. D. Ross's
translation in <i>The Works of Aristotle</i>, Vol. VIII (Oxford:
Clarendon Press, 1928). I cannot begin to offer an adequate exegesis
of this passage, or even attempt to put it into context. I use it here
simply as an illuminating point of comparison between <i>classical
metaphysics</i> and Adorno's metaphysics. Thanks to Niko Strohbach and
Burkhardt Hafeman for help with interpreting this passage.

Aristotle's interesting aside about the <i>philomythos</i> (literally:
the lover of myths) is very interesting and a little puzzling. His point
is that the <i>philomythos</i>, insofar as he too is amazed, is a kind
of <i>philosopher</i><i>.</i> Aristotle is just being respectful of the
mythmaking of the Greek cosmologists who preceded him. He clearly implies
that not just nature but also myths are sources (and appropriate objects)
of wonder. Aristotle shows his metaphysical respect for myth also at
Met. XII, 8 1074b1 where he notes that one ancient myth referred to first
substances as gods. Whilst this subsequently led to a lot of mistaken
anthropological projection, Aristotle claims that the underlying idea
of this myth, that substance is divine, is correct.

Hence, Adorno's judgment that the death camps rendered even the most
basic human fear of death banausic. "Absolute negativity is predictable:
it no longer surprises anyone." (<i>ND</i>, 355 [362]).

Adorno is at this point already reading Kant through his critics
Schiller and Hegel. For Kant, there are no underlying moral goods. There
are conditional goods, which are not yet moral, and there is the one
unconditional moral good, goodwill. But the latter <i>consists in</i>the
subjective act of willing a maxim in accordance with and for the sake of
duty. Hence, the criticism that moral duty is apt to become detached from
the underlying substantive goods and evils, may not in fact apply to Kant.

For example, Adorno interprets the inability of an immigrant he encounters
on the New York subway to return his sympathetic smile as "Hitler's
triumph." "He has not only taken away our country, our language, our
money, but also confiscated that last little smile. The world he has
created will soon make us as evil as he is" (<i>GS</i>, 20: II 585).

He is a moral realist according to Geoffrey Sayre-McCord's definition
of realism, not because he believes that moral properties are located
in the physical world, but because he subscribes to both

meta-ethical cognitivism and success theory. See "The Many Faces of Moral
Realism," in <i>Essays on Moral Realism</i>, ed. Geoffrey Sayre-McCord
(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988), 1-15. Adorno believes that
moral judgments are capable of being true and false, and he believes
that some moral judgments are true.

Adorno may be making the point that the wrongness of Auschwitz is
self-evident and that anyone who needs to be shown by argument why the new
categorical imperative is valid, has a defective moral sensibility. But
I don't think Adorno holds that we don't need the capacity for practical
reason to find out what our obligations are. Such a view is obviously
mistaken. The new categorical imperative implies other obligations, for
example, the obligation not to commit genocide or mass murder. Of course,
that may not be something we need to discover by reason, because genocide
and mass murder are also concepts we already know how to apply. But
eventually we may find that one or other of our intuitively justified
concepts, or a combination of them, has implications or applications to
new situations, which are not immediately obvious. The fact that we have
arrived at these new judgments or norms through reason and reflection
does not itself invalidate them.

For example, Adorno explicitly compares jazz enthusiasts to the blind
followers of totalitarian regimes. "What is common to the jazz enthusiast
of all countries, however, is the moment of compliance, in parodistic
exaggeration. In this respect their play recalls the brutal seriousness
of the masses of the followers in totalitarian states, even though the
difference between play and seriousness amounts to that between life and
death." T. W. Adorno, <i>Prisms</i> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1983), 128.

Of course Adorno was not the only person to make such observations about
the flaws in a culture that made it susceptible to the ideology of the
Third Reich. To take just one example, Viktor Klemperer's diaries are
full of insights that are in many respects close to Adorno's. See in
particular the entries for 18 February and 23 May 1938, and 10 December
1940. Victor Klemperer, <i>Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten:
Tageb&uuml;cher 1933-41</i> (Berlin: Aufbau Verlag, 1996).

See also <i>ND</i>, 396 [404-5]: "No light falls on human beings and
things, in which transcendence does not shine back. In the resistance
against the fungible world of exchange is the indelible resistance of the
eye, which does not want the colors of the world to be obliterated. In
the semblance is the promise of something that is not semblance."
