Narrative does not show, does not imitate; the passion which may excite us in reading a novel is not that of a "vision" (in actual fact, we do not "see" anything). Rather it is that of meaning, that of a higher order of relation which also has its emotions, its hopes, its dangers, its triumphs. "What takes place" in a narrative is from the referential (reality) point of view literally <i>nothing;</i> "what happens" is language alone, the adventure of language, the unceasing celebration of its coming.

<p class="noIndent">
In her review essay in the 1996 special issue of <i>Modern Fiction Studies</i> dedicated to Gertrude Stein, Lisa Ruddick discusses the shortcomings of the "French Feminist" readings of Stein which came to dominate the 1980s. Ruddick argues that such readings "now look . . . utopian, in both the good and the bad senses of the term," because of the degree to which they depended upon ahistorical theorizing about language and <i>jouissance</i>.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In light of this limitation, Ruddick's essay addresses three works that "situate Stein's experimental writing within various larger cultural fields."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  I would argue that the above comments by Stein, Roland Barthes, and Theodor Adorno help us to do something similar with respect to <i>Four Saints in Three Acts,</i> the opera Stein wrote with composer Virgil Thomson. By considering the abstract notions of narrative and lyric, as well as the ideological implications of operatic form, we can better understand this opera's position in the history of its genre and, hence, reevaluate just what kinds of cultural work it might be doing.
</p>

<p>
Setting aside for the moment the familiar hermeticism that haunts Barthes's comment, the sense of discovery he finds in narrative clearly echoes Stein's. For Barthes, the project of narrative language is not one of representation, it is not a matter of some kind of mimesis based upon the referentiality of such textual elements as scene, character, or even plot (though this gets closer to the issue). The act of narration is not a tableau, but gains its energy from structural relations within language itself. The drama is within the text, at the level of the language. This suggests that the drama of the narrative is fundamentally temporal. That is, the text gains its energy and its drama not by its allusive or other referential properties, but by the way language itself consists of these particular words in this particular order. Thus, the prospect of narrative is that of a quest located within language, a persistent and perpetual deferral of language's closure upon itself. Whereas Barthes thus describes the condition of all narrative as that of discovery within language, Stein reserves such a notion as praise for that language which is sufficiently conscious of its own form. It is in this sense that Stein moves away from the narrative prospect of telling stories in her language, and toward the meaningfulness of form more closely associated with lyric.
</p>

<p>
Stein's concern with retaining this sense of discovery within the form of language instead of its content is precisely what makes her opera <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> an unexpectedly apt demonstration of the sense of contradiction insisted upon by Adorno. In <i>Four Saints in Three Acts,</i> Stein's libretto and Thomson's music each take to heart the contradictions inherent in the project of opera. Since the genre's rise out of the debates of the Florentine <i>cameratas,</i> the defining contradiction at the heart of opera has been that between lyric and narrative, music and language. <i>Four Saints</i> is an opera that is exceedingly aware of itself and its place within this operatic tradition, and it reiterates and recalls this history in its own formal qualities. By dwelling in these contradictions instead of glossing them over, <i>Four Saints</i> presents the listener-reader (for it seems fundamental to be both with this text), with an operatic experience intent on dismantling the aesthetic idealism of Wagner and his heirs, thereby articulating quite different visions of art, society, and politics.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The proximity of lyric and narrative in <i>Four Saints</i> becomes evident in Stein's discussions of the opera. While treating an ostensibly lyrical project, we find her profoundly concerned with questions of temporality, representation, and drama in a way that very much resonates with her comments on these issues with respect to narrative. In her essay, "Plays," Stein articulates her theory of drama, periodically making reference to her own work, in particular to <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i>, "an opera to be sung." In this essay, Stein famously defines the opera as a landscape, suggesting that the ideal of drama is a spatialized stasis that would overcome narrative teleology. In fact, Stein describes the experience of theater as that of "nervousness" caused by a kind of syncopation between the time of the events of the drama as performed on stage and the time of the audience's reception of those events. Stein observes, "your emotion concerning that play is always either behind or ahead of the play at which you are looking and to which you are listening. So your emotion as a member of the audience is never going on at the same time as the action of the play."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Recalling her own first experiences of drama, she goes on to say that "the different tempo there is in the play and in yourself and your emotion in having the play go on in front of you . . . the thing seen and the emotion did not go together" ("P," 244-5). Stein discusses this temporal disparity and the resulting affective structure by way of the distance between the audience and the actors, the physical separation established by the curtain, and so on. For Stein, these matters of physical separation structure the kind of temporal disparity that characterizes the work's performance. The net result of all of this is the sense of nervousness in the audience, "and nervousness is the certain proof that the emotion of the one seeing and the emotion of the thing seen do not progress together . . . Nervousness consists in needing to go faster or to go slower so as to get it together" ("P," 245). Ultimately for Stein, this nervousness marks the distinction between the "excitement in real life and excitement on stage," with the former resulting in "culmination" and the latter in "relief."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Stein judges her own opera a success apparently because she sees it alleviating this sense of nervousness amongst the audience members. At one point in the essay, Stein seems to praise the opera for its ability to stand still, to be an atemporal field in which the audience could comfortably reside alongside these attendant saints. As she says,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In <i>Four Saints</i> I made the Saints the landscape. All the things that I made and I made a number of them because after all a great many pieces of things are in a landscape all of these saints together made my landscape. These attendant saints were the landscape and it the play really is a landscape. . . . A landscape does not move nothing really moves in a landscape but things are there, and I put into the play the things that were there.

Stein clearly has her relationship to cubism in mind here. In this sense, <i>Four Saints</i> is understood as a kind of cubist landscape. In fact, many critics have simply cited this passage as defining the opera's relation to temporality and gone on to explore the opera as the achievement of a nonnarrative, atemporal ideal, a drama that does not move. Stein's discussion of drama is not so simple, however, and we would do well to 

<b></b>

keep her insistence on "discovery" in mind when we consider her assertions about landscapes. Stein concludes the essay with another discussion of <i>Four Saints</i>. Here she observes, "Anyway I did write <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> an Opera to be Sung and I think it did almost what I wanted, it made a landscape and the movement in it was like a movement in and out with which anybody looking on can keep in time" ("P," 269). In this passage, Stein still judges the opera a success for its ability to overcome the sense of nervousness caused by drama's usual temporal disparity. However, she here argues that she achieved this sense of "relief" not by somehow holding the opera still, as seems to be the case in the previous comment. Rather, the proposed success of the play here depends upon its articulation of a kind of rhythmic, telescopic action with which the audience can easily keep up. She concludes her comments on <i>Four Saints:</i> "the play as I see it is exciting and it moves but it also stays and that is as I said in the beginning might be what a play should do" ("P," 269). For Stein, the success of the play depends upon its ability to elicit an affective attachment with the audience by way of its articulation of the competing demands of fixity and movement.
</p>

<p>
I would argue that this apparent paradox at the heart of Stein's discussion of drama is a productive aporia that lies at the center of <i>Four Saints</i>. The competing ideals she expresses are not simply moments of characteristic obliqueness, nor is it simply the case that the opera is gauged a <i>relative</i> success, as if it were judged on a kind of continuum from nervous syncopation to peaceful and timeless harmony. Rather, the temporal paradox in Stein's discussion of drama is productive of the opera as a whole. The opera exists, both in its libretto and its score, as a process of articulating these two competing modes. It simultaneously maintains competing drives toward timelessness and toward the temporal progression that is inevitably a part of both music and language. That is, in its degree of remove from the demands of referentiality, the opera becomes concerned above all with the prospects and limitations of temporality. Pushing toward an ideal of landscape within the realms of music and language, the opera does not extinguish temporality, it obsesses about it.
</p>

<p>
In articulating the condition of drama by way of its relation to temporality, Stein seeks a renewal of language that can help assuage what she sees as the pointlessness of telling stories. As she says in "Plays," "everyone knows so many stories and what is the use of telling another story. What is the use of telling a story since there are so many and everybody knows so many and tells so many" ("P," 260). For Stein, the prospect of telling stories seems fundamentally dried up, not because there are no more stories, but because in spite of the mind-boggling abundance of stories in the world, none of them, as a story, is really any different from any other story. Therefore, Stein sees her drama as a place in which to explore what might remain to be told in language if this formal responsibility of telling a story were removed. As she says with respect to her play, "A Curtain Raiser," "I did this last because I wanted still more to tell what could be told if one did not tell anything" ("P," 261). Since "anything that was not a story could be a play," the project of drama is "to make a play the essence of what happened" ("P," 261). Thus, as a landscape, the opera <i>Four Saints</i> would transmit the essence of the lives of the saints, not tell a story about them. And its condition as a dramatic 

<b></b>

experience would depend not upon the conventional worries of narrative, but upon the persistent invocation and withdrawal from those very conventions. With narrative a degree of remove from the opera, the opera takes the prospect of narrative itself as its subject matter instead of its method.
</p>

<p>
By articulating itself as an opera about the possibility of telling the story about these saints, <i>Four Saints</i> confronts head-on the most basic problem of narrative. In "Lecture Three," Stein dwells on the teleology of conventional narrative trajectory. Appropriately enough, the essay bears its own interesting and apt quality of circumlocution. Or rather it does not exactly speak around the subject, but repeatedly approaches and broaches the subject. The essay's particular quality of beginning again and again seems to indicate a worry over establishing the relation to the proposed subject at hand. In the very brief opening paragraphs, Stein repeatedly announces her subject. Then, in the fourth paragraph, she pauses: "But before we begin with anything that does or does not do what it is to do what it says it would if it could do that thing let us think again of narrating anything of beginning anything of ending anything" ("LT," 339). Stein returns to this problem of writing origins later in the essay, arguing that "Beginning and ending in writing anything is always a trouble of its own and it is a great trouble to any one doing any writing" ("LT," 344). This problem of beginning is constitutive of narrative because it implies the inevitable middle and ending.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  For Stein, it is the repetition of this structure that results in stories being uninteresting, no matter how new or compelling their contents may be. In order to overcome this boredom, in <i>Four Saints</i> she presents an opera that remains at the declamatory moment of beginning. This stylistic characteristic of the opera resists the teleological weight of conventional narrative, thus also ultimately articulating the particular relation between the opera and culture.
</p>

<p>
That the prospect of narrative itself might be the concern of this opera is apparent, though little remarked upon, from its opening lines. The opera announces itself with the words: 
</p>

We will return to this prologue later when we address Thomson's music and its relationship to Stein's text. For now, the text bears scrutiny for the way that it frames the issues of lyric and narrative as they will occupy the entirety of the opera. In what Marjorie Perloff might call their referential traces, the opening lines of the prologue give a sense of the "landscape"&#x02014;from the particular adoration of St. Therese which recurs throughout the opera, to the general Christian connotations of fish. These lines also exhibit the rhythm of accumulation and substitution, as well as the punning, that are so characteristic of the opera. That said, they seem more concerned with exploring the materials of language than with telling a story. That is, even at this early stage, the libretto functions not by way of eliciting sympathetic reactions to a character, but by 

<b></b>

way of its relation to its own language. These lines are followed by a single sentence that further elaborates this process of combining sound patterns, and then we get the first of many iterations of a phrase that seems central to our understanding of the opera: "In narrative prepare for saints" (<i>FSTA,</i> 581). This can, of course, be taken several ways: as directions to the cast or admonition to the audience, or even as one of the various apparently self-reflexive moments in the opera. The characteristic undecidability of Stein's text makes each of these readings possible. Further, whichever we choose, the repetition of the line and its prominence in the opening passages of the opera leave no doubt as to the importance of narrative to the text, an importance that is then perhaps most interestingly reflected in the conspicuous absence of narrative development in the opera. The opera seems to invoke the concept of narrative only to avoid it.
</p>

<p>
When considering the temporal experience thus proposed by <i>Four Saints</i>, it seems intriguing to read these lines as literally setting the stage, as putting the reader/listener in the right mental place, the right frame of mind. That is, we are to occupy the standpoint of narrative, we are to bring narrative (and thus teleology) to mind in order to observe this opera that is other than narrative. Such a proposition seems to be sustained by another line repeated in the opera, "A Narrative to Plan an Opera" (<i>FSTA,</i> 584), as well as the instruction to "Enact End of An Act" (<i>FSTA,</i> 587). The opera is about narrative not only in the sense that it concerns the very possibility of narrating the lives of these saints, but also in that it demarcates the elements necessary to the narrative it thus proposes. In this sense, <i>Four Saints</i> might be considered a performance that announces the conditions and materials of an opera that never literally takes its place. As Brad Bucknell has argued, this insistent presentness of the opera weighs in on modernist concerns with the status of knowledge and temporality by "enact[ing] <i>now</i> the opera which will occupy some future present."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  By continuously invoking and withdrawing conventions of narrative and musical progression, the opera endlessly projects itself as a possibility. To borrow from "Composition as Explanation," it never ceases "beginning again and again."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In fact, among its many nonsequential act and scene divisions, the opera contains the instruction to "Repeat First Act," a line which is sung in Thomson's music, but a direction which is not followed. The line comes immediately after a moment in the libretto that seems to pose an unlikely ethical stance for St. Therese. The ominous hypothetical is offered, "If it were possible to kill five thousand chinamen by pressing a button would it be done," with the reply, "St. Therese not interested" (<i>FSTA,</i> 586). Falling immediately as it does before the direction to "Repeat First Act," this line seems to present not so much an ethical problem as it does a reminder of the logic, or, perhaps, the antilogic of the opera. As the conventions of linear development of plot, character, and music do not hold, neither do the teleological underpinnings of cause-and-effect reasoning. St. Therese is not unethical or callous. She occupies here a sort of miniature story to remind us, after all, that the opera is not telling a story. And, in case we don't get it, we are even told to go back to the beginning and come right back to that spot.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
As an aesthetic project historically concerned with the relationship between narrative and lyric, opera in general, and particularly one with the explicit concerns and consequent style of <i>Four Saints,</i> acquires its identity precisely by the way it balances these competing modes. As Lawrence Kramer has argued, such a relation is far from the exception. Rather, the incommensurable interdependence of lyric and narrative is the rule. In <i>Music as Cultural Practice,</i> Kramer deftly illustrates the way in which even "instrumental music seeks narrative as a strategy of its deconstruction."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Adopting the terms and logic of Derrida's early essay, "Force and Signification," Kramer aligns the idealized project of lyric composition with the principles of structure, and argues for narrative as the inevitable force that interrupts and derails these ideals.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  As Kramer defines his terms, "'structure' [is] the concept of an organized totality, modeled implicitly on visual/geometric order and characterized by an interdependency of parts. 'Force,' a deliberately imprecise term, is temporal and dynamic in character and associated with value, beauty, feeling, and is graspable principally as it disrupts structure and compels change" (<i>MCP,</i> 176). Building from this dialectic, Kramer proposes the term "other-voicedness" as a way of naming the process by which lyric ideals are undone by their own desire for the effects of narrative language and their consequent recourse to narrative principles. Instead of proposing this as a self-annihilating drive in lyric, Kramer argues, by analogy, that "both force and structure can invigorate each other" (<i>MCP,</i> 177). It is not the case that narrative interruptions of lyric defeat lyric. Rather, these very interruptions are both desired by lyric and productive of lyric. As the lyric/structure teeters toward its narrative demands, it establishes the conditions of its own necessity, its own energy. Which is to say that only as lyric desires narrative does it make itself possible. Desiring the effects of narrative, lyric both undoes its proposed purity and brings itself into being. 
</p>

<p>
Such a recognition of the interdependence of narrative and lyric suggests the proximity of language and music. In doing so, it implies that we must qualify just what it means to say that music and poetry are the "arts uniquely dependent on the immediate tangible organization of time" (<i>MCP,</i> 4). Discussing the purposefully resistant and generative force of this ordering of time, Kramer argues that "the temporality of music and poetry resists the immediacy of a work just enough to intensify it, to invest it with certain forms of expectation and desire" (<i>MCP,</i> 8). For Kramer, it is the "structural rhythms" of the poem and the musical work that are responsible for their possibilities of affective attachment. This would seem to be precisely the sort of rhythm that functions in <i>Four Saints,</i> accounting for the kind of telescopic quality that Stein described in the opera. However, the opera gains its particular temporal quality not merely by alternating between lyric and narrative, but by simultaneously maintaining these incommensurable ideals. The tension between lyric and narrative in the opera, its persistent invocation and withdrawal from narrative conventions, functions not as a matter of proposition and retreat. Rather, the coexistence of narrative and lyric is the very condition out of which the opera arises. 
</p>

<p>
The primacy of this conflict is evident in the way the libretto resists narrative conventions, even at the level of grammar. Thus, the opera presents us with passages such as this, from Scene X:

And so on; they apparently settle on "ten." Opening with an ambiguous temporal concern and a rhyme, "Scene X / When," the passage proceeds through a playful moment of self-reflexivity, and then into an exercise in rhyming (though it is of course not accidental that the rhymed words indicate the subjects time, counting, and "men"). The point is that the rhyme game exists in contention with the very subject matter proposed by the scene, and is indispensable to it. The "when" that is suspended over this scene announces both the lyrical and the narrative register in which the passage will be written. As indicative of the general condition of the opera, this passage demonstrates the way in which <i>Four Saints</i> privileges neither narrative "force" nor lyrical "structure," to recall Kramer's binary. The two are, instead, incommensurable equals. With respect to the libretto, the opera presents a characteristic Stein text that is primarily interested in the play between language and its conventions, in the sense of the playful discovery that language can allow. This lends the opera what is perhaps its primary temporal quality, its persistent sense of declamation. The proposition of this opera is thus of an aesthetic experience that offers a kind of textual-musical world operating otherwise than according to our expectations of language. As such, its basic characteristic, the one that defines it from the very beginning, is that it is irreducible, that it exceeds conventions of logic, reason and language. Its particularity as an artwork is the very great degree to which it refuses to resolve the conflict between lyric and narrative.

<p>
Virgil Thomson's score for the opera echoes and develops this tension between lyric and narrative that we have so far located primarily within Stein's libretto. In <i>Virgil Thomson: His Life and Music,</i> John Cage recounts his project of systematically studying Thomson's development as a composer. Cage "decided to remake, insofar as possible, the adventure [Thomson] himself had actually experienced."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Describing the project as an "expedition" following "the general plan of beginning at the beginning and going on until [he] got to the present," Cage explores each of Thomson's works from the musicological standpoint of structure and form, as well as with respect to its materials and methods, thereby developing a broader consideration of how generally to characterize the nature of Thomson's music and thus to place him within the contemporary music of 1959 (<i>VT,</i> 117). Cage affectionately describes the opera as a "quantity of quality," and describes Thomson's "new creative method" adopted for the setting of <i>Four Saints:</i> "seated at his piano, text before him, and singing, he improvised an entire act at a time until it became clear to him that the vocal line and the harmony had taken stable form" (<i>VT,</i> 157). When he sets to analyzing the score, Cage observes that "this score stands apart from Thomson's previous Stein settings in that it defies analysis. Scholarly study of it yields nothing but statistics. These give the impression that the materials of music, in contrast to those of poetry, are becoming impoverished. There are 111 tonic-dominants, 178 scale passages, 632 sequences, 38 references to nursery tunes, and one to 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee'" (<i>VT,</i> 157). Cage concludes that "no attempt to grasp <i>Four Saints</i> will take hold of it" (<i>VT,</i> 157). As Cage's comments suggest, however, it is precisely the opera's resistance to conventions of musicological analysis that provides its particularity as a piece of music. Cage appropriately describes this particularity as being both ephemeral and comedic: "to enjoy [the opera], one must leap into the irrational world from which it sprang, the world in which the matter-of-fact and the irrational are one, where mirth and metaphysics marry to beget comedy" (<i>VT,</i> 157). Cage's description of the opera as a comedy is both perfectly apt and surprisingly nearly singular. Most critics take the opera dreadfully seriously, thereby missing at least part of the point&#x02014;what might seem obvious from such ironic details as the opera's opening with a snare drum roll and the oompah-pah of the Midwestern band shell, its purposefully simplistic phrasing and instrumentation, and its use of recitative for a libretto that defies discursivity. The opera's exploration of and investment in the tension between narrative and lyric is not one of crisis or desperation at the failure of language. Rather, as is generally the case with Stein, the opera celebrates the play available at the limits of discursivity.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Literary Modernism and Musical Aesthetics,</i> Brad Bucknell has convincingly articulated the connection between Thomson's music and Stein's language as precisely this play. Bucknell quantifies the ways in which Thomson's score reiterates Stein's linguistic experimentation, arguing that, "Thomson, basically, though not simply, begins again and again. . . . and in doing so really adopts for tonal music a Steinian technique not of the continuous present, but of what might be called continuous presentation" (<i>LMMA,</i> 196). Bucknell's recasting of Stein's "continuous present" draws attention to the insistence of the score, the way the music's form constructs its persistent immanence. As Bucknell analyzes the formal qualities of Thomson's score, he argues that

Thomson's tonality, rich in its teleological tendency, its constant emphasis on reaching, if not some ultimate symbolic goal, at least a series of provisional points of reorientation, establishes not only an ironic interaction with Stein's language which is always in some sense "about to be," but more crucially, it enacts the temporality of movement and stasis which constitutes the Steinian landscape.

As the score consists of phrases, tones, and structures that are largely simple and often eerily familiar, it constantly puts the listener on the brink of identification with the music. At the same time, this potential identification is cut short by the degree to which the phrasing denies the build-up of dramatic tension or other modes of large-scale directionality. For the listener, the resulting effect is to emphasize the experience of hearing the music of the opera in its "nowness," as Bucknell argues. That is, much as Stein's language depends upon the conventions of language as it undercuts them, so does Thomson's music gain its affect and import from the continuous process of invocation of and withdrawal from expected structures of dramatic musical development. 
</p>

<p>
Bucknell's musicological analysis details the "ironic interaction" between Stein's text and Thomson's music, locating the energy of their relationship at the tension between the teleological tendency of Thomson's music and Stein's nondiscursive text. Focusing on Thomson's tonal language, Bucknell argues that his tonal shifts "impl[y], though cannot confirm . . . the <i>course</i> of meaning which could be present if the language would play along" (<i>LMMA,</i> 199). As the music provides an apparent means of relative structure to the opera, this structure is not so much an ordering principle or organizing frame as it is " a kind of simulacrum of teleology" (<i>LMMA,</i> 215). In Bucknell's analysis, the music thus provides not just a neutral background against which Stein's text can be performed, but, much more significantly, an alternate, and in some ways contestatory, aesthetic experience, the presence of which further develops the opera's interest in temporality and knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
Bucknell develops his musicological analysis partly with respect to the prologue in a way that resonates with our present concern with the relationship between narrative and lyric. As we have seen, the prologue introduces us not only to the themes but, more importantly, to the strategies by which the opera will mean, foregrounding linguistic play at the interpenetrated limits of lyric and narrative. As Bucknell describes, Thomson's phrasing in the prologue similarly works at the edges of expectation and recognition. Analyzing Thomson's rhythmic and tonal choices, Bucknell argues that the music "adjusts itself to the language," though it simultaneously articulates an additional level of signification to the libretto. He observes that Thomson's composition bears logical and purposeful relation to Stein's language:

Words falling on the first beat of a bar are emphasized, but against this emphasis the &#x000E6; pulse, even though it is distributed over bars of varying length, remains a strong influence here. Thomson generally places these words on the stronger beat of the bar and gives them a clear prominence in the tonality: 'know' is sung on an F, 'love' is sung on C as part of an arpeggiated descending F major chord sung in the melody, two of the first three 'saints' are sung on a C, the second occurrence falling on a G which finishes the melodic phrase that began on the fourth beat of bar 5. In bars 10, 11, and 14 the word falls on the first beat of the bar and is sung F, C, and F respectively.

Though there is no programmatic connection between the libretto and the music, Thomson's score conscientiously emphasizes words that seem to bear significant semantic weight. However, this apparent structural consistency between the words and the music is only part of the game in the prologue, and, in fact, the music "plays a kind of parodic dance with the language" (<i>LMMA,</i> 185). As Bucknell's analysis demonstrates, the music here "both conceals and reveals the word 'fish'" (<i>LMMA,</i> 185). 
</p>

<p>
As we noted earlier, <i>fish</i> in these opening lines seems to provide one of the early thematic images of this proposed saintly operatic landscape. However, our observation of the connotative significance of this term ignored its grammatical context. Any Christian associations we might make with the term seem to exist in contention with the demands of the phrase in which it repeatedly occurs, "it makes it well fish," presenting a tension between sense and nonsense. Bucknell's analysis demonstrates that Thomson's music focuses on this term and provides it with an "obscure prominence." Thomson everywhere doubles the resonance of "fish," such as when he gives it but "an eighth note's duration" and places it "at the end of a melodic phrase even though it falls on the first beat of the bar" (<i>LMMA,</i> 185). Or, similarly in terms of tonal choices, when it is "sung on an A, and even though this is a relatively strong pitch in F major, it is sung over the C dominant chord which weakens its relationship to F major" (<i>LMMA,</i> 186). Thomson's play with the term both elaborates the tension evident in Stein's text and, in Bucknell's analysis, "overcomes grammatical obscurity, though it does not erase it" (<i>LMMA,</i> 186). The tension between "linguistic-moral progression" and "grammatical obscurity" functions as the "other-voicedness" which Kramer identifies at the heart of all lyric. Thomson's tonally simple, teleologically inclined music resonates with Stein's text not because it provides it with a structural overlay, but because it internalizes the contest between lyric and narrative, force and structure that so defines Stein's language. 
</p>

<p>
If Stein's language moves toward the lyric and away from the narrative by way of its explorations of syntax, grammar, and aurality, Thomson's music moves toward the narrative via its purposeful simplicity and its play upon cultural resonance. As Bucknell argues, "Thomson's very structured tonality and rhythm <i>suggest</i> the image of a syntactical and ordered progression and acceptable <i>social</i> structure. The language, on the other hand, keeps making verbal appeals and creations, assertions it does not care to prove or make clear" (<i>LMMA,</i> 202; italics in original). Daniel Albright similarly recognizes the apparent purpose of the music's simplicity and rightly describes it as a sampling of an American musical consciousness.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  As Albright explains, Thomson's music 

<b></b>

consists largely of phrases lifted from the country's liturgical traditions and the local brass band. Thus, as much as the opera has a religious feel to it, this background also frequently provides it with the anachronistic sounds of the community band shell and the militaristic tones of parades and marches done in the vein of John Philip Sousa. In fact, such gestures are evident from the opera's very beginning. Thomson's music begins with an almost comically regular &#x000E6; beat in which an oompah-pah in F major alternates with one in C major. As such, the music from the beginning sounds more appropriate perhaps to the local carnival than it does to an opera about saints. Emphasizing the humor of Thomson's composition, Albright draws our attention to the way the music in these early measures takes on a kind of sly grin: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
it is harmonically galumphing: the tonic is overdetermined, overweighted, paralyzed by the dominant chords that monitor and define it. . . . Overemphasis leads to a weakening of the thing emphasized, in this case the concept of the tonic. Another oddity is the meter, which keeps shifting, so that the accent of the passage as a whole is as likely to fall on the first or the second pah as on the oom.

<p class="noIndent">
As we have seen, this "overdetermination" and "overemphasis" that Albright identifies in the opening phrases of the opera becomes the doubling that emerges with the text. What's more, as both Albright and Bucknell note, this awkward weightiness is no accident. Thomson's compositional strategy was partly a conscious process of resisting the highly intellectualized practices of musical modernism, especially those of Schoenberg. As Bucknell argues, Thomson's purposefully simple musical vocabulary in <i>Four Saints</i> "becomes the perfect foil for Stein's language in a way which more 'difficult' music might not have succeeded in becoming" (LMMA, 183). The effect of the "other-voicedness" achieved by Thomson's composition, the preponderance of "doubled acoustical images" is that the piece offers meaningful temporal progression as a topic or a problem, not as a technique. 
</p>

<p>
As Albright, Bucknell, and Cage have all noted in their own ways, Thomson's music resists conventions of dramatic musical development and intellectual sophistication even as it plays on the brink of those conventions. We might understand the meaningfulness thus achieved by Thomson's music by way of recourse to the metaphysics of music found in Victor Zuckerkandl's <i>Sound and Symbol.</i> The "continuous presentation" Bucknell demonstrates in Thomson's score strongly resonates with Zuckerkandl's recasting of our commonsense notions of music as the temporal art. Zuckerkandl meticulously quantifies the inherent directionality of music, arguing that the temporal experience of music results from neither the demarcating beats of meter nor the sonic event of musical tones as conventionally understood, but from the desire-laden "dynamic" of tones and rhythm. That is, when we hear music, we hear not simply tones and meter, but, rather, we quite literally hear time in the will to completion that is embedded as an inherent part of those tones and their rhythmic constitution.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Thus music is not temporal art in the pedestrian sense that it consists of notes taking place over a period of time, but, rather, "music is temporal art in the special sense that in it time reveals itself to experience" (SS, 200). For Zuckerkandl, what music thus teaches 

<b></b>

us about time more generally is that it is neither linear nor repetitious, but that it is always simultaneously forward-looking, anticipating the progression of the very structure which it constitutes, and recursive, perpetually throwing the listener back on what has come before. This notion of musical time seems to be emphasized in Thomson's score, with "its propensity to move by sequence or by contiguity rather than by progression" (SS, 202). As Thomson avoids the processes of counterpoint or opposition that would carry senses of intentionality, the musical phrases may be snapshots or musical vignettes, but they thus seem to have no goal. There is no drive for resolution; the opera simply stops or shifts more than it logically concludes. The listener, therefore, is presented with a musical piece that seems irreverent, caring not for its own past at the same time that it defies logical anticipation. Just as the libretto so frequently announces its debut, the music perpetually presents its own beginning. In such a circumstance, the audience is left in a persistent state of uncertain expectation, reaching for its own connections between these various musical and linguistic phrases, or, perhaps more to the point, questioning the tenability of any such connections. The listener is not so much asked to follow the story or the music as encouraged to inquire how, on what grounds and in what way, they proceed. 
</p>

<p>
This structural affinity is also evident in Thomson's use of counting. As in the passage from Scene X, the libretto frequently introduces counting apparently for the sake of counting, or as an opportunity for exploring simple aural possibilities of language. In fact, "much of Stein's text consists of strings of numbers, such as 'One two three four five six seven all good children go to heaven some are good and some are bad one two three four five six seven'" ("ONA," 597). These strings of numbers, however, do not imply direction or progress. Here, the counting seems to be a frame of rhyme and meter in which the opera plays. In a certain sense, this passage, and others like it, seem committed to the sense of counting Stein describes in "Poetry and Grammar," where she asserts, "one and one and one and one and one. That is the natural way to go on counting."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  That is, numerical order, as with narrative progression, is not the substance of meaningful, "natural" engagement with the world for Stein. As Albright observes, Thomson's score exhibits a similar strategy: "when Thomson set this to music, he simply assigned the eight syllables of 'One two three four five six seven' to a descending D-major scale. . . . the text inspires the music to enumerate its fingers, to count along with it&#x02014;but the music-counting soon gets desynchronized from the text-counting, inconspicuously, without a fuss" ("ONA," 597). Though the music slips into a kind of syncopation with the text, this shift does not bear dramatic weight because the two were not bound together in a commonly meaningful direction in the first place. The aptness of their relation is a structural or procedural one, residing at their respective explorations of their own most basic grammars. As the eight-syllable line ending in "seven" provides a simple linguistic frame of rhyme and meter, so does the use of the eight descending notes of a major scale. The libretto and the music adopt these similar frames in which to develop procedures of reduction, interestingly founding their relationship on what Zuckerkandl identifies as the musical experience of time. For Zuckerkandl, music demonstrates to us that we do not hear singular tones, we 

<b></b>

always hear a tone on its way to or from another tone. What's more, even if we hear a series of tones that are identical in pitch and intonation, we will group them, most naturally in clusters of two, three, or four (SS, 167). This counting passage from the opera seems to recognize just this inclination and to construct itself primarily around its insistent iambs, the alternating accents of which then provide a rhythmical tension with both the progress of the numbers and the descent in the music. As the semantic resonance of the passage recedes, its syntactic signification is foregrounded.
</p>

<p>
A similar sense of reduction underscores the common musical exercises that periodically recur throughout the score. Resisting the appearance of a highly refined work of art, the opera frequently presents itself as a kind of music primer. Albright describes an early example of this technique: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
when the accompaniment plays a chord in E-flat major, and Saint Teresa I obligingly sings "She is to meet her" as an ascending perfect triad in E-flat; four bars later, the accompaniment plays an E-major chord, and she sings "Very many go out" as an ascending perfect triad in E; and so on, to F and F-sharp and G. . . . it removes all sense of direction or consequence: the singer begins at a note chosen randomly, near the bottom of her range, and proceeds upward by semitones until she stops, not for any reason of music syntax, but only because her voice has run out of notes. . . . it is a semantic void: there is no expression of emotion, no subtlety of phrasing, only an attempt to instill an exact memory of pitch in the muscles of the larynx.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
At moments such as this, the opera seems to be a mere lesson for the singers. In this sense, the score also presents itself as the most basic materials upon which an opera could be constructed. That is, just as the libretto articulates the constituent elements of a possible narrative, the score projects an opera in the future tense by articulating those materials and procedures upon which any such opera would depend.
</p>

<p>
The declamatory nature of the piece, at the level of both the libretto and the music, is the very strategy by which it means. That is, this lyric's concern with narrative, the particular cohabitation of these two linguistic projects, is the way in which this opera proposes a particularly temporal meaning for itself. From its serial allusions to its self-reflexivity, this lyric reaches toward the possibilities of narrative in such a way that it tells the story of its own telling. What's more, for both Stein and Thomson the temporal experience thus achieved is very particularly American. Accordingly, the most direct allusion in the music matches perfectly with the only readily discernible direct quote in Stein's libretto, the phrase, "My Country 'Tis of Thee." The concern here is clearly not just an experience of history or temporality broadly considered, or even simply of music and language, but a specifically American experience. As such, we can consider the opera's perpetual projection of itself into the future, the way in which it endlessly leaps forward from familiar phrases, as perhaps a comment on the condition and possibility of America. Thus, the declamatory insistence enacted by the opera's form is resonant with Stein and Thomson's perceptions of early twentieth-century American culture. It is in this sense that we might understand the implications of Steven Watson's comment that, "Like Gertrude, <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> was the 

<b></b>

essence of America, embodying not its anecdotes and history but its sound and structure."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This claim about the opera's national particularity was central to its composition for both Stein and Thomson. As Watson and others recount, their original intention was to write an opera about George Washington, but Thomson rejected the idea because he didn't like the lack of individuality that would be caused by all of the actors wearing eighteenth-century wigs. So, they settled on Saint Teresa of Avila. Hardly an obvious choice, but also not an arbitrary one. As Watson argues, "[Stein] repeatedly described <i>Four Saints</i> as an opera about Spain and the Spanish landscape. The opera's geography was not literal, but Spain provided Stein with a field of associations" (<i>PS,</i> 43-4). Thus Stein and Thomson set about writing an American opera with Spanish saints as its characters. Choosing such a subject for an ostensibly nationally specific opera already suggests the relationship <i>Four Saints</i> will bear to the tradition of opera. As Richard Dellamora and Daniel Fischlin have argued in <i>The Work of Opera: Genre, Nationhood, and Sexual Difference,</i> the history of opera is imbued with assertions of national pride and the invocation of nationally specific religious myths. Particularly coming to a head in the nineteenth century in res such as Verdi and Wagner, opera was from its beginnings a matter of developing synecdoches for the fate of the nation. As their introduction puts it,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Opera frames its narratives in a collective imaginary that follows a particular logic dependent upon a vision of nation as the imagination of a collective will yoked to the common goal of production.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Dellamora and Fischlin conclude that "opera produces . . . the public realm of nation, insofar as opera voices an archetypal model of what nation is" (<i>WO,</i> 3). Stein and Thomson's project of writing an American opera clearly echoes this cultural function of the genre. Stein's decision to use sixteenth-century Spanish saints, however, is fundamentally quite different from, say, Wagner's recourse to Germanic myth. As Thomson would later recall, "A Jew and a Protestant turn out a Catholic opera about Spain in the 16<sup>th</sup> century and in the course of writing that music I came into practically total recall of my Southern Baptist upbringing in Missouri."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The playfulness of tone in this passage should not be missed, nor should the notion of gathering a sense of historical identity precisely by virtue of absence. Though Thomson would return to the U.S., at the moment of composition his perspective seems to be an example of an exile's optimism. <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> is an opera full of play, an opera of play, and in such an instance, the notion of a "national aesthetic," to invoke Adorno's discussion of Wagner, is presented as something other than founding the roots of the nation in myth. In this sense, the opera's relation to its own proposed national project echoes the music's relation to structural development. Both fundamentally deny the nostalgia that lies at the base of opera's historical connection with nation.
</p>

<p>
Such a divorce is never quite so easy, of course. In fact, the opera seems to bear many of the marks of Wagnerism, particularly in Stein's commentary from "Plays." 

<b></b>

That Wagner should come into the picture at this point is no accident. It is impossible to account for the general implications of nationalism in opera without confronting him. The case with this opera is even more specific, however. <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> was composed between 1927 and 1929. At the time, Thomson was deeply involved with the compositional music scene of Paris, and this scene was largely defined by the specter of Wagner. Further, it is perhaps instructive to remember that Schoenberg had reached musical maturity and prominence by this point, and that he began his Wagnerian project <i>Moses und Aron</i> only a year later,in 1930, and that Thomson explicitly sought to distinguish himself from Schoenberg in his development as a young composer. 
</p>

<p>
Thomson shed the weight of the Wagnerian heritage by reaching for the legacy of Satie, particularly for his sense of humor. Nevertheless, Stein's assertion that "nothing happens" in <i>Four Saints</i> seems to resonate with the project of mythification that is so central to Wagnerian opera. If Wagner pursues national mythification partly by way of temporal stasis within the music and seamlessness between the acts, then we are inclined to wonder whether Stein's apparently atemporal ideal functions similarly. The question, then, is what elements of <i>Four Saints</i> seem to retain Wagnerian ideals, and what seems to escape their influence. First, it is important to consider precisely why such ideals need escaping in the first place. In his study <i>In Search of Wagner,</i> lamenting what he sees as the hollowness of the Wagnerian legacy, Adorno indicts the <i>Gesamtkunstwerk,</i> arguing that "the very seamlessness of the form of the music drama, the Wagnerian 'style' itself, is what is at fault. Music no longer possesses its decisive power: its ability to transcend imprisonment, in the context of an action."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  For Adorno, the "seamlessness" of Wagnerian opera extends from the unity of the arts to the musical concerns of instrumentation and tonal relation. Adorno's primary critique of Wagner is that he sought to achieve this not by finding an essential unity between the arts, but instead by forcing a kind of top-down unity under the baton of the heroic composer-conductor. As Adorno demonstrates, the ultimate goal of the image of the composer-conductor is "the occultation of production by means of the outward appearance of the product&#x02014;that is the formal law governing the works. . . . The product presents itself as self-presenting; hence too the primacy of chromaticism and the leading note" (<i>ISW,</i> 85).
</p>

<p>
This ideal of the self-producing artwork is what constitutes Wagnerian opera as fundamentally bourgeois. Adorno argues that "The conductor-composer both represents and suppresses the bourgeois individual's demand to be heard. He is the spokesman for all and so encourages an attitude of speechless obedience in all" (<i>ISW,</i> 35). As Wagnerian opera demands capitulation on behalf of the audience, the audience is only all the more pleased. As Dellamora and Fischlin put it, "<i>the work of opera</i> is to stage the pleasure of the false consciousness that is nation, to re and voice the contradictions implicit in any production of imperial order, to display the allure of the heterogeneous, the differend that will not be eradicated, the queer" (<i>WO,</i> 11; italics in original).<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The pleasure of the opera is the pleasure of dissimulation, and, as such, the threat of opera as conceived under the banner of Wagnerism is that it depends upon 

<b></b>

depicting and thus containing those elements of society by which it defines itself as culture. Opera does not pretend to be realistic. Rather, in its very extravagances, both conceptual and in terms of the cost of production, opera proclaims itself as the bourgeois artwork par excellence by insisting on its ability to unify disparity in the common cause of nation. In these terms, the struggles for freedom and individuation that permeate the themes of opera are inevitably struggles between the Enlightenment notion of individual freedom and the power of myth to found community. Of course, the Wagnerian ideal of unity always decides this struggle in favor of myth, even before the struggle has begun. The importance of such opera is not to provide tales of liberation or freedom, but to celebrate the delusion of freedom born out of its own imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
This de facto judgment in favor of myth is what constitutes Wagnerian opera's relationship to time and history. As a process of bourgeois celebration, opera articulates the myth of origins. Adorno demonstrates that this ideal of timelessness has a structural correlative in Wagner's compositional techniques. He argues:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The absence of any real harmonic progression becomes the phantasmagorical emblem for time standing still. . . . The standing-still of time and the complete occultation of nature by means of phantasmagoria are thus brought together in the memory of a pristine age where time is guaranteed only by the stars. Time is the all-important element of production that phantasmagoria, the mirage of eternity, obscures.

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The ideal of the seamless work of art functions both at the level of the composition and in the relationship between the disciplines to present a mythical state of eternity. For Adorno, this also accounts for the sheer duration of Wagnerian opera: the degree of Wagner's success is measurable by the fact that though several hours may pass during a performance, the musical structure and thematic timelessness of the piece so deny temporal progression that they compensate for this extravagance.
</p>

<p>
It is here, at the discussion of the timeless as the ideal of art, that we might locate a disturbing if unexpected similarity between <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> and the project of Wagnerian opera. This risk is precisely why I insist on retaining Stein's more complicated notions about the temporality of drama. If, as Albright claims, "the text defies discursivity and the music defies temporal progression" to the degree that the opera is little more than a "directionless field of pleasant acoustic events," ("ONA," 574) then the opera retains the responsibility of ration and is inevitably, if unintentionally, relegated to the status of bad Wagner. In this sense, Stein's assertion that "nothing happens" in <i>Four Saints</i> approaches a pale version of the fundamental characteristics of Wagnerian opera, as Adorno has them:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The eternity of Wagnerian music . . . is one which proclaims that nothing has happened; it is a state of immutability that refutes all history by confronting it with the silence of nature. . . . Nothing is changed; and it is the dynamics of the individual parts that reinstate the amorphous primal condition.

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
However, I would argue that Stein's insistence on the troubled nature of temporality in the ideal drama suggests that <i>Four Saints</i> functions quite differently. And, appropriately enough for a representative work of modernism, the difference between these perhaps apparently similar goals is evident at the level of style. 
</p>

<p>
Whereas Wagnerism strives toward timelessness by articulating the opera as a process of logically achieved artistic unity, <i>Four Saints</i> conveys the crisis at the center of just such a project. Thomson's score does not present itself as an inviolable unity; nor does it seem to bear any programmatic relation to the text at hand. Rather, what is significant about the relationship between the text and the score is precisely the very great degree to which they "acknowledge the perplexity of the problems and possibilities of their union" (<i>LMMA,</i> 222). The music does not try to lend expression to the words, as Albright notes, it "assists the text&#x02014;not by reinforcing it, not by expressing it, but by providing a pleasant and commodious <i>environment</i> in which the words can achieve their maximum intelligibility" ("ONA," 603; italics in original). This is the importance of the irony of the choice of recitative for Stein's libretto. The result of this irony, and the process of the opera as a whole, is that instead of offering itself as a perfectly integrated, autonomous object, the opera functions as a perpetual act of declamation, an unceasing process of prying open the totalizing effects of conventional musical and narrative development. This structural dimension of the opera is echoed in its thematic elements. The opera does not develop or even describe characters in scenes together. Rather, at those moments when the opera does seem concerned with a notion of scene, it provides the materials for a scene that might occur, which is why those relatively discursive moments of the opera read not like drama but like stage directions for a drama. The opera is not timeless by virtue of being directionless; rather, its resistance to conventions of directionality and development imbues it with the temporal.
</p>

<p>
All of this suggests that the opera functions as a parody of opera itself. <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> invokes the conventions of particularly Wagnerian drama by way of its subject matter and its character as a nationally specific work; it invokes grammatical conventions of narrative and music. And it does so precisely to critique these conventions and explore what persists in language and music aside from such regulations. In this sense, the opera functions not so much as anti-opera (as some might have it), but as the very quintessence of opera. Inasmuch as opera is a celebration and reaffirmation of bourgeois myths of identity and unity, its greatest desire is to "confirm its own pleasure in dissimulation. The closer opera gets to parody of itself, the closer it is to its own most particular element" (<i>SF,</i> 16). For Adorno, it is this fundamental characteristic of opera which is responsible for what he sees as the crisis of modern opera: "the genre cannot dispense with illusion without surrendering itself, and yet it must do so" (<i>SF,</i> 16). This awareness of itself as dissimulation, always a fundamental component of opera, is one way to understand Schoenberg's abandonment of <i>Moses und Aron</i>. As Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe argues in <i>Musica Ficta</i>, <i>Moses und Aron</i>, a consummately Wagnerian piece in conception and intent, is ultimately paralyzed by its identity as "the offering of a work that explicitly thematizes the questions of its own possibility as 

<b></b>

a work&#x02014;modern in this way&#x02014;and that thereby carries in itself, as its most intimate subject, the question of the essence of art."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  For both Adorno and Lacoue-Labarthe, the result of <i>Moses und Aron</i>'s self-awareness is a kind of generic suicide for opera, or, at best, a sophisticated articulation in "the register of the <i>mise-en-abyme</i> and of citation" (<i>MF,</i> 120). That is, as a representative of the condition of high modernism, Schoenberg's opera drives opera to its own death by reducing it to the necessary awareness of its own nature as dissimulation.
</p>

<p>
It is not entirely clear, however, that such a recognition must necessarily result in the death of the genre. It might also be the case that opera's realization of its own identity in self-parody might be reinvigorating. As Lacoue-Labarthe demonstrates, the central reason behind Adorno's interest in Wagner and his declaration of the crisis of modern music is the degree to which Adorno retains the Wagnerian ideal of <i>musica ficta,</i> the rative ideal of music which Lacoue-Labarthe describes as "the aestheticization&#x02014;the ration&#x02014;of the political" (<i>MF,</i> xv). Invoking the primary principles of Adorno's aesthetic, Lacoue-Labarthe argues that "the possibility of a 'structural perception,' the unified (and thus totalizing) nature of music, the adequation of such a unity to the 'idea' of the text (to its metaphysical signification), the 'obligation' itself. These are all incontestably principles that come from Wagnerian aesthetics" (<i>MF,</i> 122). These are, of course, the terms in which Adorno had developed and defended the compositional developments of Schoenberg. Lacoue-Labarthe's argument, thus, is that Adorno critiques Wagner and Wagnerian ideals in Wagnerian terms. In this sense, Schoenberg's reduction of opera to the contemplation of its own possibility is the limit case of opera because there is no further development made available by the laws of bourgeois society. Having articulated its essence as bourgeois self-parody, having laid bare the paradox at the heart of its ideal as <i>musica ficta,</i> opera is made powerless by its own development.
</p>

<p>
This is, of course, another version of the tragic conception of art that underlies much discussion of modernism. In such an understanding of the development of art, the authenticity of an artwork depends upon a kind of self-annihilating critique, in which the artwork "is only itself in the impossibility of effectuating that which founds its authenticity" (<i>MF,</i> 124). Denying the ruse of origins, the modern artwork must proclaim the impossibility of its own authenticity. Inasmuch as opera retains the notion of <i>musica ficta,</i> this remains a paralyzing situation. For Adorno, this implies that "the criterion of social truth of music today is the extent to which it enters into opposition to the society from which it springs and in which it has its being&#x02014;in short, the extent to which it becomes 'critical,' however indirectly" (<i>SF,</i> 12). Music, in this context, is forever confined to the situation of secondary and critical commentary on the society out of which it comes. Thereby, of course, being critical of itself above all else. However, a similar awareness of the flawed ideal of <i>musica ficta</i> might have very different consequences for an artist or composer less committed to the Wagnerian ideal.
</p>

<p>
In Thomson and Stein, we seem to have such artists, and the defining characteristics of the opera demonstrate its distance from the problems of ral music. Accordingly, the irony of the opera's use of recitative is echoed in its other elements. Thomson's 

<b></b>

idiosyncratic compositional technique, as described by Cage, seems purposefully to defy the deification of the composer-conductor characteristic of the Wagnerian tradition. The peculiar energy of the relation between the music and the text, the purposeful lack of conventional strategies of setting text to music, is utterly at odds with the concept of unity at the heart of structural perception. And, perhaps most tellingly, Thomson's experience of regaining and employing the soundscape of his own background demonstrates the importance of personality to this opera. Above all, <i>musica ficta</i> must seek to unify the idiosyncrasies of personality in its reach toward generalizable myths of origin and community. The defining presence of nonintegrated personality, combined with the absence of the authoritarian composer-conductor, which is to say the opera's style, is one means by which this opera avoids the prescriptions of ral music. Embracing the oddities of personality, defying the conventions of <i>musica ficta,</i> and resisting the drives toward structural closure in both lyric and narrative, the opera takes its place in culture in a way quite different from the myth-making and regulatory role of Wagnerian opera.
</p>

<p>
All of which is to say that theopera presents not a Wagnerian ideal of seamlessness, functions not as a cultic object. Rather, it displays its seams, revealing and reveling in its very constructedness, thereby throwing the onus of coherence onto the audience. This resistance to the pretense of unity thus constitutes a different affective structure from that of Wagnerian opera. Instead of identifying with the myth of origin under the baton of the composer-conductor, the audience of <i>Four Saints</i> is given the responsibility of creating order. In this sense, <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> seems to satisfy Adorno's hope for opera in the future. Recalling the importance of the myth of Orpheus to opera, Adorno asserts that in opera, "the audience is called upon as a witness, if not indeed as a court of appeal" (<i>SF,</i> 21). In Wagnerian opera, the success of this appeal constitutes an affirmation of the audience itself, as well as the primacy of the heroic conductor-composer. That is to say, of the ideal of unity emblematized by the opera itself. Adorno's argument suggests that for modern opera, after Wagner and after <i>Moses</i>, this appeal must take a very different form:

The degree to which Thomson's music retains Adorno's demand for "subtlety and complexity," is a matter for consideration beyond the confines of this discussion. Suffice to say that the apparent simplicity of the opera's music is not a matter of na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9;, but the product of a well-trained and highly innovative musical mind exploring the possibilities of musical Americana. Of more immediate interest to our discussion is Adorno's hope that new opera abandon the superstition of origins. In this sense, the opera's parodic invocation of the ral ideal at the heart of Wagnerian opera suggests just such an escape. As such, the opera's denial of conventions of narrative or lyric development, its very thorough insistence on force over structure, throws any possibility of 

<b></b>

coherence into the future and onto the audience. With its parody of ritual and of the resulting cultic quality that historically characterized opera, <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> presents itself not as a unifying gesture of materials upon which a nation might be founded, but as the celebration of the impossibility of such claims of origin.

Culmination and relief, here, might certainly be read by way of the expectation of catharsis. Also, they are ways of articulating temporal experience in life and the text. Life has culmination because it is an accrual of actual events that continues to proceed. The text, as an artwork, has no time outside itself. Completing the text, one achieves relief. In these terms, my argument with respect to this opera is that it resists the teleology that underwrites conventional drives toward relief. The opera's defining characteristic is the way in which it resists moving toward a sense of relief by way of the completion of any dramatic, structural unity, either lyrical or narrative. The result is that the time of the opera, the time in the opera, is utterly other than the sequential time that defines both narrative and traditional notions of lyric structure.

Of course, for Stein this question of beginning and middle and ending resides not just at the level of the story but also at that of grammar. Thus, the famous sentence from this essay, "I love my love with a b because she is peculiar," can be understood as a process of retaining the form of grammar while inserting words as place-holders that resist semantic expectations-a process by which Stein sought to emphasize the drama of discovery at the level of the language instead of its story. We might understand <i>Four Saints</i> as a radicalization of this process in which even the grammar and its commensurate expectations are altered. That is, <i>Four Saints</i> does not retain the grammar of opera but takes that grammar as its problem.

Though productive as a means of considering the ways in which lyric and narrative inform and depend upon one another, Kramer's discussion depends upon a too-easy binary between the two. Further, while Kramer aligns "force" with narrative's interruption of the troubling ideal of lyric unity, Derrida's essay from which Kramer draws these terms is obviously concerned with narrative as a matter of "structure." Partly, this is a matter of the localized histories of the particular disciplines, and Kramer is clearly attempting to problematize the historical ideal of lyrical unity within the tradition of musicology.

Daniel Albright, "An Opera with No Acts: 'Four Saints in Three Acts.'" <i>The Southern Review</i> 33, no. 3 : 574-605; hereafter abbreviated as "ONA." As Albright puts it, "Thomson's music is derived from the scales, triads, and snatches of hymns that constitute the racial unconsciousness of Western music" ("ONA," 592). Obviously, the implication here is that of a particular racial consciousness. Hardly universal, it is a consciousness derived from Thomson's experience and reflects his position as a Harvard-educated, white composer born in Missouri in 1896. As Barbara Webb has argued, the racial implications evident in Albright's characterization of the opera are deeply problematic. As Webb rightly points out, Thomson and Stein both made several racially essentializing comments in their correspondence when discussing the choice to cast African American singers for the opera. What's more, Webb convincingly argues that such casting at least partly accounts for the perhaps unexpected success of the opera. By casting African Americans to sing this speech which approaches "nonsense," Stein, Thomson, and Maurice Grosser, the opera's original designer, whether consciously or not, exploited the conventions of minstrelsy. "The Centrality of Race to the Modernist Aesthetics of Gertrude Stein's <i>Four Saints in Three Acts,</i>"  7 : 447-71.

Bucknell similarly identifies the problem of race in the staging of <i>Four Saints</i>. He argues that "Thomson's music in fact makes the operatic text more socially acceptable, and . . . so too did the black cast of performers and dancers. This is, I would maintain, because they visually solidify the 'otherness' of the text&#x02014;that is, at least for the <i>white</i> viewer/listener, and indeed, for the <i>composer</i> as well. The performers take the edge off any disturbance that could be caused by the language, and in another way, by the music; they manifest it in the image of its otherness" (<i>LMMA,</i> 216).

Though I'm not doing so here, it is certainly conceivable, as Dellamora and Fischlin's comment suggests, to argue the function of <i>Four Saints in Three Acts</i> under the rubric of camp, particularly appropriate in light of the way "its production developed hand in hand with the largely homosexual constellation of Harvard-trained art professionals who would define modernist taste in America" (<i>PS</i>, 7).
