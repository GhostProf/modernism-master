1. Projects of Language Reform
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p id="lead">

The concern of this article is language, and specifically the various projects of linguistic "purification" that were part of literary modernism in Britain. It will explore a range of texts and projects concerned with reforming spoken and written forms of English and will argue that modernist cultural practice can be understood in relation to an aspiration towards linguistic reform, not simply in the sense of aesthetic innovation and experiment, but also in the context of educational, cultural, and political initiatives designed to transform linguistic usage and norms. </p>

<p>Projects of language reform are not, of course, distinctively modernist, though they do have some claim to be distinctively modern. If the development of the printing press from the late fifteenth century is one of the foundations of modernity, it is in its immediate wake that we find the first concerted efforts at language reform, with the period between 1560 and 1630 seeing "an unparalleled amount of activity in the field of spelling reform in English."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  With the decline of Latin as an international language in the seventeenth century, there was then a growing anxiety about the suitability of the English language as a medium for general philosophical and scientific inquiry. Thus, the Royal Society set up a committee for improving the English language 

<b></b>

 in 1664, which was to include among its members Robert Hooke, Sir Isaac Newton and John Dryden. And in the eighteenth century both the acerbic wit of Jonathan Swift and the obsessive scholarship of Samuel Johnson were trained on the target of precise and correct usage of the English language: Johnson's 1755 <i>Dictionary</i> aimed to provide precise definitions of words "in the context of an academic attention to the possibilities of a perfect English language."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Such desires for precision and correctness coupled with fears of linguistic dilution are thus not recent phenomena, but can be found within cultural criticism from the early-modern period.  </p>

<p>The urgency and the perceived importance of linguistic reform in Britain increased markedly, however, as English became a more prominent international language for intellectual argument and for scientific inquiry, and then again as the literate public expanded over the course of the nineteenth century. The extension of compulsory elementary education across the nineteenth century to the point of universal provision brought the challenges of new readers and new modes of writing, but it also created an institutional location, the elementary school, in which projects of reform could be imagined and even realized. By the early years of the twentieth century, the capacity of the English language to enable precise and widespread communication, to articulate forms of national identity, and to sustain intellectual and artistic innovations were all the subject of intense debate. And these political, cultural, and pedagogical questions interact intriguingly with the avant-garde and radical political and artistic projects from this period that we have come to understand under the heading of "modernism." </p>

<p>Concern for and with the English language was expressed by the formation of a wide range of societies and associations in the early twentieth century, which aimed to publicize their anxieties and to advocate possible remedies for the perceived defects of the English language. One of these organizations was the Society for Pure English, whose early membership consisted of prominent writers and literary critics, including Thomas Hardy, Edith Wharton, Robert Bridges, A. C. Bradley, and Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. To quote from their 1913 founding <i>Prospectus</i>: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is therefore proposed that a few men of letters, supported by the scientific alliance of the best linguistic authorities, should form a group or free association, and agree upon a modest and practical scheme for informing popular taste on sound principles, for guiding educational authorities, and for introducing into practice certain slight modifications and advantageous changes.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">"Men of letters" are here understood to have a particular responsibility for the state of English and also to have a specific duty to inform, and to reform, popular taste. The Society for Pure English sought to harness the reforming energies of the "best linguistic authorities," but it was nonetheless committed to a project that was both democratic and popular: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Believing that language is or should be democratic both in character and in origin, and that its best word-makers are the uneducated, and not the educated classes, we would prefer vivid popular terms to the artificial creations of scientists. (â€¦) we shall help to preserve the living and popular character of our speech.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
<b></b>
</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">From these strongly populist beginnings, the Society for Pure English produced a regular series of tracts between the end of the First World War and the 1930s. The membership grew, and the Society continued to attract a range of writers, artists, academics, and "linguistic authorities." By 1919, for example, Roger Fry, Jane Harrison, and Gilbert Murray were all members. The Society's early association of "the people" with linguistic authenticity, expressed so forcefully in their 1913 <i>Prospectus</i> was, however, subjected to increasing pressure, and by 1925, Robert Bridges, who was then Poet Laureate, was arguing that, "the fact that language develops in the common talk of the people is as true as ever, but it is a truth that is nowadays much qualified by the fact that everyone now reads."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Mass literacy here apparently represents some rupture in the association of "the people" with linguistic authenticity, and for Bridges at least popular speech was now no guarantee of the vitality of written English. </p>

<p>Language reform in the early years of the century was driven not only by such anxieties about linguistic impurity, but also by a desire for more effective global communication. Many writers and reformers argued that the variety of languages across the globe represented a barrier to the full achievement of effective international communication that was otherwise implicit in new electronic and print technologies. The aspiration towards an "international language" was manifested in a wide variety of schemes for linguistic reform from the 1890s. Perhaps the most famous of these is Esperanto, an artificial language devised by Lodovic L. Zamenhof at the end of the nineteenth century. Zamenhof grew up in what was then Russian territory, though his hometown of Bialystok is now part of Poland. He witnessed a complex series of violent conflicts between the different ethnic and linguistic groups living in this region, which convinced him of the urgency of developing a new linguistic medium for more effective communication. Zamenhof himself spoke Polish, German, Russian, Lithuanian, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, and English but was nonetheless worried about the time and energy necessarily expended in the mastery of so many languages. As the poet Ciaran Carson notes in a recent article describing his father's close involvement with Esperanto from the 1930s, "from an early age Zamenhof was anguished that men and women everywhere looked much the same, yet spoke differently, and thought themselves to be Poles, or Russians, Germans, Jews, and so on, instead of human beings."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Zamenhof argued that through the establishment of a new international language, "the whole world would be as one family."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  His choice of the pseudonym "Dr Esperanto" stressed the real hope such a world language could bring for those who sought to move beyond the proliferation of national cultures and towards an international alliance of peoples.  </p>

<p>Zamenhof based his language largely on existing Romance languages. He devised a system of root words, with suffixes and prefixes being used to designate modifications. Word endings were used to indicate parts of speech, and by this means Zamenhof significantly reduced the importance of word order within his language. A flavor of the language can be gained from the following translation of the popular nursery rhyme, "Baa Baa Black Sheep": 



 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>"Baa Baa black sheep! Have you any wool?" <br />"Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full! <br />
One for the master, and one for the dame,  <br />
And one for the little boy who lives down the lane." </p>
<p>"Ba, ba safo! Cu hi havas lanon?" <br />
"Jes, tri sakojin: prenu en la manon! <br />
Unu por la mastro, unu por mastrin, <br />
Kaj unu por la eta knabo ce la strata fin."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p>By the time of Zamenhof's death in 1917, Esperanto had attracted significant numbers of supporters and speakers, who worked together in clubs, evening classes, and congresses to advocate the widespread adoption of the language as an aid to mutual understanding. The irony of the death of this proponent of world peace through a common language during an unprecedented period of military conflict is of course considerable. The very destructiveness of the First World War, however, was to generate an urgent desire to avoid a repetition of violence on such a scale that would dominate subsequent discussions of the possibility of an international language. </p>

<p>In the 1920s, Sylvia Pankhurst was also preoccupied by the search for an international language. Sylvia Pankhurst is now best known for her work in the early years of the twentieth century within the suffrage movement, a movement that was an important context for the development of aspects of a modernist cultural project.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  She also played a significant role in a range of socialist movements from around 1912, including the Workers' Socialist Federation, which affiliated to the newly formed Third Communist International, and was thus part of the process of formation of the British Communist Party in 1920. By the 1920s, however, language reform, and in particular the creation of an international language of communication, occupied perhaps a surprising amount of Pankhurst's time and energies. She wrote in 1927 that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Interlanguage will play its part in the making of the future, in which the peoples of the world shall be one people: a people cultivated and kind, and civilized beyond today's conception, speaking a common language.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">We first find evidence of Pankhurst's enthusiasm for the idea of an international language in the journal <i>Germinal</i>, which she cofounded in 1923: the first issue of the journal includes a substantial item on Esperanto, which describes the history and nature of the language, arguing that "by learning Esperanto you acquire Citizenship of the World," and advertising a forthcoming introduction to Esperanto published by Pankhurst's own Dreadnought Press.  </p>

<p>By 1927, Pankhurst's commitment to an international language was more vigorous, though her belief in the viability of Esperanto had considerably slackened. In a study of the future of international language published in that year, Pankhurst acknowledged the achievements of Esperanto, but argued for the superior virtues of an alternative system known as Interlingua, which was developed by Giuseppe Peano in 1904. Pankhurst 

<b></b>

 was keen to stress the progressive and liberatory potential of a commitment to international language, arguing that "the greater share of the first spade-work for Interlanguage was done by Socialists and lovers of popular fraternity."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Pankhurst's advocacy of Interlingua finds further expression in her 1928 volume, <i>Is An International Language Possible?</i>, published on behalf of the British section of the Academia Pro Interlingua. In this text, she insists that a new international language could command widespread acceptance if it were fully supported by schools and by the media, and cites as enthusiastic proponents authorities from Descartes, Pascal, and Leibniz to the more contemporary Nietzsche, who "declared the coming of universal language to be a certain as that of aviation." Pankhurst here describes Interlingua in positive terms as "Latin without inflexions."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The return to linguistic classicism here does, of course, have its modernist literary resonances. But for many commentators such a return to Latin could not possibly address the linguistic challenges of international communication in the early twentieth century. Among the more significant of the various alternative attempts to imagine a linguistic medium for effective international communication is the substantial cultural and linguistic project of "Basic English" as it developed from the early 1920s under the auspices of C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. The idea of BASIC (as well as having the more obvious meanings of plain and simple, it stands for British American Scientific International Commercial) is closely connected to the broader philosophical investigations into the nature of meaning conducted by Ogden and Richards in the early 1920s. In a text such as <i>The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language Upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism,</i> Ogden and Richards lay out a view of the nature of language and in particular of the domains of the symbolic and the emotive in language, which was to provide the intellectual framework for much critical engagement with the developing practice of modernist poetics. Ogden and Richards's work on "the peculiarly difficult borderlands of linguistics and psychology" in <i>The Meaning of Meaning</i> drew on interdisciplinary models derived from philosophy, literary criticism, and ethnography to develop a generalized model of a science of meaning, and to understand "how words work."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  That the legacy of this research should encompass both the development of models of critical close-reading that were to make the canonization of modernist literary writing possible in the 1950s, and also the development of a new simplified pedagogy for the teaching of English as an additional language, is both fascinating and perplexing.  </p>

<p>Looking back on the creation and development of Basic English from the vantage point of the 1940s, Richards indicated its close intellectual relation to the period of <i>The Meaning of Meaning</i>, or of the companion text <i>The Foundation of Aesthetics</i> published in that great year of modernist innovation, 1922: "It [Basic] had its origin, perhaps in 1920 when Ogden and I were considering the analysis and control of the meanings of the word 'meaning'."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Ogden and Richards's aim was to create a simplified version of English, which could nonetheless form the basis of precise and effective communication: 



 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Basic English is English made simple by limiting the number of its words to 850, and by cutting down the rules for using them to the smallest number necessary for the clear statement of ideas.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup></p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>B</i>, 20)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">For Richards, developing and publicizing Basic was part of a broader commitment to a politics of community and of collectivism: "the learning and use of the common language should be symbolic of the learner's participation in the common human political effort, a sign that he recognises the claim upon him of the world community" (<i>B</i>, 10). For Ogden, it was also perceived as a means to avoid further wars: "the absence of a common medium of communication is the chief obstacle to international understanding, and therefore the chief underlying cause of War."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Ogden and Richards were thus committed to the development of a common international language as a means to create a people that would not be bound by frontiers, a global citizenry able to draw on the resources of new communications technologies such as radio, telephone, and cinema to construct a distinctly modern version on community.  </p>

<p>Ogden and Richards's initiative had a significant impact on the literary and political culture of the early 1930s, and the significance and viability of Basic English were widely debated. Ogden interestingly noted the potential shared terrain of Basic English and the contemporary literary innovations of James Joyce in his 1931 study, <i>Debabelization</i>. But he was also quick to point out the distinction between Basic and what he saw as the fruitless project of creating an international language on the basis of widespread borrowings from a range of existing languages, suggesting, however, that "a foretaste of such a language may be found in the later work of James Joyce."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  I will return to this apparent dichotomy between the project of Basic English and Joycean linguistic experimentation a little later.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
2. T. S. Eliot and the Nature of Poetic Language
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The epigraph to this paper contains what is for me a highly resonant phrase from T. S. Eliot's <i>Four Quartets</i>: "to purify the dialect of the tribe." This phrase, borrowed not quite faithfully from MallarmÃ© and containing a homage to Edgar Allan Poe, haunts me as I try to think through the complex relations between modernism and linguistic reform. It embodies the symbolist presence within modernism while also staging an argument about the relations between poetic writing and the people. The power of Eliot's phrase lies in its capacity to evoke histories and texts that stage a poetic argument about the social function and the poetic function of language.  </p>

<p><i>Four Quartets</i> engages consistently with the question of language. In three out of the four sections there are passages that explicitly evoke the struggle of a poet with the raw material of poetry. Thus in the fifth part of 'Burnt Norton' Eliot writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words strain, <br />
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, <br />
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish, 

<b></b>

 <br />
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place, <br />
Will not stay still.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>FQ</i>, 12)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">This follows on from a reflection on the role of form and pattern in creating meanings. Words are expressive, Eliot suggests, because (like music) they exist in time and form a pattern. The pattern, however, is one of "silence" and the movement one of stillness. The conflict generated by such a movement towards stasis or by articulated words reaching towards silence is picked up in the passage above, which insists on "tension," "strain," and "decay" as integral qualities of the linguistic medium. The decay is generated by imprecision, but also by the movement that is a fundamental aspect of language as an expressive form. Again in "East Coker," Eliot returns to examine "the intolerable wrestle with words and with meanings" (<i>FQ</i>, 17) and he asks whether we can expect any significant help in this struggle from the poetic tradition that lies behind and within us. Later, in the fifth part of "East Coker," he returns to the question of linguistic inadequacy in the following terms: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years â€“ <br />
Twenty years largely wasted, the years of <i>l'entre deux guerres</i> â€“ <br />
Trying to learn to use words, and every attempt <br />
Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure <br />
Because one has only learnt to get the better of words <br />
For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which  <br />
One is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture <br />
Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate  <br />
With shabby equipment always deteriorating <br />
In the general mess of imprecision of feeling, <br />
Undisciplined squads of emotion.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>FQ</i>, 21â€“22)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p>By the final section of the poem ("Little Gidding") then, Eliot has already set in play a series of ideas about poetic language that have at their core the dilemma of imprecision and the legacy of poetic tradition. In the second part of this final section, Eliot stages an encounter between the persona of the poem and a mysterious ghostly stranger who offers the poet advice. The ghost talks to the poet about his relation to the past, discloses some of the "gifts reserved for age" and exhorts the poet to remember that final judgement will not be based on worldly successes or secular values. The meeting takes place "In the uncertain hours before the morning" and the encounter is obscure in many senses. The ghostly stranger is uncannily familiar and reminds the poet of "some dead master / Whom I had known, forgotten, half-recalled" (<i>FQ</i>, 38). In her study of the composition of <i>Four Quartets</i>, Helen Gardener has argued that "in the first and second version, the ghost speaks with Eliot's own voice. It is, in a profound sense, a meeting with himself."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In later revisions, the stranger comes increasingly to resemble W. B. Yeats. Eliot was aware of Yeats's interest in the relations between poetic language and the language of popular speech as well as his commitment to transformative reworking of this speech. Eliot himself acknowledged the importance of Yeats for the creation of the ghostly stranger, writing "the visionary re has now become 

<b></b>

 somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  But the episode is also reminiscent of a meeting that takes place in Dante's <i>Inferno</i> XV, where Dante gives a cry of horrified recognition on meeting his old master Brunetto Latini. Given that Eliot had drawn on a verse form in this section of the poem (terza rima) that is so powerfully associated with Dante, his poetic legacy is also very clearly part of the argument being staged.  </p>

<p>The "familiar compound ghost" thus contains elements of Eliot himself, of Dante, and of Yeats. The phrase with which I am most directly concerned in this discussion, however, adds to this mixture the voice of the symbolist MallarmÃ©. MallarmÃ© uses the image of purification in a sonnet called "The Tomb of Edgar Poe," which was published in 1877. In the first four lines of the sonnet MallarmÃ© imagines a reawakened Poe confronting his uncomprehending contemporaries with drawn sword. Then MallarmÃ© writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Eux, comme un vil sursaut d'hydre oyant jadis l'ange <br />
Donner un sens plus pur aux mots de la tribu <br />
ProclamÃ¨rent trÃ¨s haut le sortilÃ¨ge bu <br />
Dans le flot sans honneur de quelque noir mÃ©lange. </p>
<p>They, like a writhing hydra, hearing seraphim <br />
Bestow a purer sense on the language of the horde, <br />
Loudly proclaimed that the magic potion had been poured <br />
From the dregs of some dishonoured mixture of foul slime.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The purification MallarmÃ© evokes here expresses a fundamental separation. The poet, Poe, is despised and misunderstood and the value of his poetic currency is not recognized. Purification is his work, but the sonnet cannot imagine this as in any sense a social or collective act. If MallarmÃ© is fascinated by the kind of poetic purification that Poe seems to enable, then Eliot is markedly more uneasy. Eliot writes disapprovingly that "an irresponsibility towards the meaning of words is not infrequent with Poe," and connects this explicitly to the symbolist desire for "la poÃ©sie pure."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> </p>

<p>So what does this allusion to MallarmÃ©, added, Helen Gardner suggests, at a late stage in the poem's composition, do to Eliot's already complexly layered argument about speech and poetic language?<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  It draws our attention firstly to the fact and then to the importance of the English language as the medium of composition of Eliot's poem. MallarmÃ© himself was in fact interested in the creative and poetic potential of the English language. In his short study, <i>Les mots anglais </i>, MallarmÃ© wrote about the ways in which the English language carried traces of other languages and histories, and FranÃ§oise Meltzer has suggested that he saw its poetic potential as quite distinct from that of French: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>French, on the other hand, underwent a kind of forced cleansing, with the sixteenth-century PlÃ©iade. The PlÃ©iade's insistence on a standardized orthography and on the use only of words with Latinate etymologies was a mixed blessing, since it stripped the French language of the cross-breeding which characterizes English.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup><b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">

 MallarmÃ©'s sense of English as a language that carries echoes of other languages and layers of historical meaning was shared by Eliot. In an essay on Dante, Eliot comments explicitly on the layering of meaning within English and contrasts it with the lucid quality of Dante's Italian: "In English poetry words have a kind of opacity which is part of their beauty."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> </p>

<p>So the presence of a loose translation of MallarmÃ©'s language within this section of <i>Four Quartets</i> reminds us that Eliot's struggle is not simply with language, but specifically with the English language. It also puts the symbolist poetic legacy, and its appropriation of what Eliot sees as Poe's irresponsible relation to language and its meanings, into relation with Eliot's own struggles with language in <i>Four Quartets</i>. The ghostly stranger talks confidently of the fact that "our concern was speech, and speech impelled us / To purify the dialect of the tribe," but the nature and the ethical significance of this impulsion is never fully articulated. MallarmÃ©'s project of poetical purification is invoked but not endorsed in this section of the poem. The relation between speech and language, particularly, remains unresolved. MallarmÃ©, after all, had talked only of "les mots" and had not specified whether these words were written or spoken. In translating this as "speech" Eliot appears to ask a question about the poet's responsibility to popular speech that could never really have been asked by MallarmÃ©, but also that is never fully answered in his own poem. </p>

<p>That this question was of interest to Eliot is in no doubt, as can clearly be seen in two essays Eliot published while working on "Little Gidding." In the first of these, "The Music of Poetry," Eliot explicitly discusses MallarmÃ© as "one of the more obscure modern poets â€¦ of whom the French sometimes say that his language is so peculiar that it can be understood only by foreigners."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The main focus of Eliot's argument, however, is the close relationship between poetry and speech: "it is the poet's business to use the speech which he finds about him" ("Music," 31). He argues that the musicality of poetic language is derived from the music latent in common speech, and also suggests that this constitutes an entirely appropriate limit to forms of poetic innovation, "I do not believe that the task of the poet is primarily and always to effect a revolution in language. It would not be desirable even if it were possible" ("Music," 35). </p>

<p>So the relation between poetic language and common speech would seem for Eliot to constitute a barrier to the project of a pure poetic language. This relation is also the basis on which Eliot imagines a national poetic tradition in his essay on "The Social Function of Poetry": "emotion and feeling, then, are best expressed in the common language of the people â€¦ the structure, the rhythm, the sound, the idiom of a language expresses the personality of the people which speaks it."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  So Eliot imagines a poetic language informed by the rhythms and idioms of popular speech and also capable of giving expression to a specifically national structure of feeling. But still, Eliot argues that the responsibility of the poet is not, primarily, to the people, "his direct duty is to his <i>language</i>, first to preserve, and second to extend and improve" ("SF," 20). Preserving and improving the national language are integral to Eliot's poetic project. Writing during the Second World War, Eliot cannot help but be aware of some of the dangers of intact nationalisms, however, and he discusses the imperative for more effective

 communication between different European nations. He acknowledges that there is "something to be said" for the creation of a lingua franca such as Esperanto or Basic English, but also says, "supposing that all communication between nations was carried on in such an artificial language, how imperfect it would be!" ("SF," 23). Eliot's conviction, finally, is that poetry exists to remind us of the things that can be said only in one language. </p>

3. Lingustic Reform and Poetic Tradition
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The relation between national tradition and poetic language was also important for the work of another modernist writer with an enthusiasm for linguistic innovation, Hugh MacDiarmid, born as Christopher Murray Grieve in Dumfriesshire, Scotland in 1892. After an early career as a journalist he began to publish poetry, and to polemicize for the renewal of Scots language and culture from the early 1920s, adopting his pseudonym in 1922. MacDiarmid's early poetic work was part of the Scottish Renaissance, which drew together an impressive array of literary and cultural historians and critics as well as a range of creative writers. All combined a scholarly passion for Scotland's past with an experimental and innovating commitment to the renewal of early-twentieth-century Scottish literature. Hugh MacDiarmid's first target for linguistic reform was thus, unsurprisingly, the language of the Scots. From an early age he was committed to "adventuring in dictionaries."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In the 1920s, the dictionary in question was Jamieson's <i>Dictionary of the Scottish Language</i>, which MacDiarmid mined for words and phrases that would allow him to construct a version of Scots that combined lyricism and vigor, and would embody what he saw as the enabling precision and robustness of a Medieval Scots associated with the poetic output of William Dunbar. Despairing of what he understood as the linguistic legacy of Sir Walter Scott, and its pernicious impact on Scottish poetry and prose, MacDiarmid worked on the creation of a form of synthetic Scots, which would later be known as "Lallans." MacDiarmid's 1926 collection, <i>A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle</i> is the most powerful expression of this adventure in synthetic Scots, combining a vividly historical imagination with a powerful and bracing lyricism. </p>

<p>MacDiarmid's poetical and political project was both singular and yet collectively enabling, and his writings of the 1920s undoubtedly underpin much subsequent writing in Scots and in Scotland, as well as capturing many of the tensions and contradictions that haunt the modernist project more broadly. The specificity of MacDiarmid's poetical and cultural commitments is well captured by Alan Bold, who writes of him as a nationalist with an often poor opinion of Scotland, a communist with a doubtful enthusiasm for the proletariat, and a social creditor with little knowledge of economics.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The tension between MacDiarmid's assessment of the impoverished state of his contemporary Scottish culture and his confidence in the capacity of Scotland to be the source of cultural and literary renewal can be glimpsed in the following two extracts from his 1943 collection, <i>Lucky Poet</i>: <b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>â€¦ But Glasgow's hordes <br />
Are not even literate save a man or two; <br />
All bogged in words that communicate no thought, <br />
Only mumbo-jumbo, fraudulent clap-trap, ballyhoo. <br />
The idiom of which constructive thought avails itself <br />
Is unintelligible save to a small minority	 <br />
And all the rest wallow in exploded fallacies <br />
			â€”â€”</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->






<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The interests of the real highbrow and the working class are identicalâ€”resistance to any intellectual short-circuiting or stereotyping.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Here it is clear that the referential capacity of language is at the heart of MacDiarmid's engagement with his contemporary culture. He sees a proletariat denied the resources of expressive communication, and consequently mired in delusion. Their words cannot communicate thought and they cannot access the idiom of intellectual engagement. Yet MacDiarmid goes on to argue that the proletariat and the intellectual are in fact united through their objective interests in linguistic precision and the overcoming of the stereotype.  </p>

<p>By the early 1930s, MacDiarmid was turning away from his project of writing in Scots, though certainly not his project of writing in some sense for the Scots. His intellectual and political passions had long tended towards the construction of models of unity and of wholeness (a common enough modernist compensatory passion). Indeed, he defines the common threads of his own writing as lying in a commitment to human wholeness, a critique of poverty, and an openness to the whole world of knowledge.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  He argues at various times that such an engagement with international strands of thought and writing are characteristics of Scottish rather than English modernism, pointing out, for example, that the first translators into English of Nietzsche, Proust, Rilke, and Kafka were all Scots.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Such an inclusive and all-encompassing international reach for the culture of Scotland comes to seem increasingly important to MacDiarmid from the 1930s on, as his own writing tends towards the creation of a new poetic language that will be "an all-embracing language, and interpenetration of all languages."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The significance and the necessity of such a world language is explored in MacDiarmid's long poem <i>In Memoriam James Joyce</i>, conceived and largely written during the Second World War. </p>

<p>This text consists of a challenging collage of citation, polemic, and reflection, which constantly returns to linguistics and to language reform as the intellectual core of MacDiarmid's cultural project. MacDiarmid cites within the poem many particular influences on his writing within the world of letters in Britain, notably John Davidson (the poet and proselytizer for Nietzsche) and Charles Doughty, the author of the curious and in many senses anachronistic poem <i>The Dawn in Britain</i> , which was also to have such an impact on the linguistic thinking of Laura Riding.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  But he also invokes linguisticians from Carnap and Saussure to Alexander Murray and "That heroic genius, Antonio Gramsci / Studying comparative linguistics in prison" (<i>IM</i>, 27). MacDiarmid is explicit in his skepticism concerning the possibility of achieving the linguistic range 

<b></b>

 and reach he desires through any project rooted in the linguistic heritage of English literary culture. He dismisses Basic English as a flawed and limited project (<i>IM</i>, 61) and English literary writing more broadly is condemned because it has severed all connection with the people, or as MacDiarmid writes here, with the masses: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>But the arts, and particularly the written arts <br />
Of Great Britain have been forced <br />
By the "highly refined imaginations  <br />
Of the more select classes" <br />
Have been so forced out of all contact with  <br />
Or inspiration from the masses <br />
That, inasmuch as any human manifestation <br />
That is taken in hand by any coterie <br />
Or class of the more select <br />
Must speedily die, <br />
So literature in Anglo-Saxondom <br />
Has, after growing  <br />
More and more provincial, died.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>IM</i>, 122)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">As opposed to this morbid language of a coterie, MacDiarmid seeks in his poem to create a language that is "quick," "sure," "lucid," and with "a quality of fiery aery light" (<i>IM</i>, 88). Joyce, and particularly the late Joyce of <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, is MacDiarmid's exemplar. MacDiarmid reaches out to different literary and philosophical traditions as a means to capture the real historical experience of globalization: "It is now during the second quarter of the twentieth century that we are aware of the appearance of a literature which assumes that the world is an indivisible unit," and "the differences between languages and cultures begin to grow less marked to one who is accustomed to contemplating the unity of the human spirit" (<i>IM</i>, 14). MacDiarmid is concerned here, in a gesture towards Eliot, with "the living whole of all the poetry that has ever been written" (<i>IM</i>, 20) and also with the "unity of thing and word / Of feeling and its articulation" (<i>IM</i>, 49). He writes with Joyce in the recognition of the diverse myths and languages that might subtend the recognition that "our consciousness is beginning to be planetary" (<i>IM</i>, 14). </p>

<p>But (and this is cruelly to curtail a proper analytic discussion of this poem) despite its commitment to precision, to inclusiveness, and to the "progressive articulation of the world" (<i>IM</i>, 5), MacDiarmid's formidable text remains a daunting interpretative challenge. If Basic English's international aspirations were limited and limiting, MacDiarmid's world language is limitless but ultimately both frustrating and frustrated. The wrestle with language as an expression of a concrete history gives way in MacDiarmid's poem to a more abstract and ultimately solipsistic endeavor to create a world language. But it remains uncertain whether this language can ever really be shared, even with the very particular community of readers of modernist poetry or modernist poetics. Here, perhaps, we reach a limit of modernist linguistic reform in the creation of a poetic language that cannot generate shared meanings and shared histories through the process of reading.
