For most readers, lyric poetry stands on the farthest end of the
literary continuum from politics. On the other hand, feminist and marxist
readers identify all literature as political in the sense that all texts
participate in cultural ideologies and hence in structures of discourse
and power. Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's 1914 publication of <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> (<I>Hebr&auml;ische Balladen</I>) provides an interesting
case for thinking about how both positions function; this volume of
lyric poetry contains no public or social "political" references and
the poet herself claims not to be "political," but its repeated themes
and structure as a volume suggest a radical critique of the assumptions
underlying the political dynamics of Wilhelmine Germany. Because such
a critique is merely suggested and because it is formulated largely
through mythic, religious narrative and love poems, readers who, like
Bauschinger, believe that "Political thought has to be realistic" remain
confirmed in their conviction that the volume's significance is instead
biographical, spiritual, or aesthetic. Like many of her contemporaries,
however, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler

<B></B>

saw no dissonance between the fantastic or utopian and the
political. Expressionist philosopher and essayist Ernst Bloch, in
particular, defends what he calls the "utopian function" inherent in all
great works of art or social visions as being responsible for whatever
humanizing the world has experienced. The intensity of excess or surplus
in utopian creations causes a "mobilization of those contradictions
inherent in the bad existence in order to overcome that existence, in
order to bring it to the point of collapse."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 He argues that the imaginative power of anticipation or consciously
 directed hope is more real than any sociological or bourgeois realism
 and that all great art aspires to such power. While distinctly less
 utopian than Bloch, as well as less grounded in a specific political
 ideology, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler does construct mythical-religious fictions
 that critique early-twentieth-century Wilhelmine culture through their
 celebration of relationships defying its conventions and norms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most poems in <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> portray intimate moments in the
lives of biblical res, but instead of celebrating same-class,
same-nation, heterosexual love or partnership, much of the volume's love
and communication occurs between social unequals and between men. As
a consequence, love appears instructional, not sentimental or weakly
ideal. To use Bloch's terms, these poems display the "unimpaired reason
of a militant optimism," personally, not socially, cast.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Complex responses to dominant gender constructions underlie these
 portraits of intimacy and imply another kind of instruction. All
 the relationships Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler portrays suggest principles and
 practices that stereotypically would have been seen as feminine but that
 in her poetry also partake of a power and expressiveness associated
 with men. Moreover, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler attributes these qualities
 and practices both to women and to the great patriarchs of Jewish and
 Christian tradition--Joseph, David, and even God himself. In an era
 characterized by extreme gender essentialism and misogyny, such portraits
 imply a protest by demonstrating alternative possibilities. Through
 their characterization of rulers and powerful men, these poems also
 implicitly protest the nationalism and militarism characterizing the
 age of Wilhelm II and more generally the ethos of a military-industrial
 state as experienced in Berlin, a city with extensive slums, huge
 factories, and rigid class divisions. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler modifies the
 anticipatory or hopeful aspects of the volume, however, by placing its
 utopian moments in a mythic past that itself also contains treachery,
 death, and isolation. Consequently, <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> seems to mix
 elements of nostalgia and mourning with the sharper edge of its utopian
 social critique.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler was a German Jewish poet born in the industrial
town of Elberfeld (Wuppertal) in 1869; she moved to Berlin in 1894;
and her publications span the years 1902-1943. In 1933, she fled
to Switzerland and in 1939 was forced into further exile in Palestine
where she died in 1945. With her publication of <I>Hebrew Ballads</I>
in 1913, followed by an expanded volume in 1914, she was at the height
of her writing powers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Also by 1914, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler was twice-divorced, impoverished, the
 mother of a (for all purposes) fatherless adolescent son, and strongly
 linked with the Berlin bohemian community.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 In 1932, after three decades

<B></B>

of writing poetry, experimental fiction, and dramas, circulating her
paintings and sketches, and playing an influential role in German
Expressionist circles, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler won the Kleist prize for
outstanding literary achievement in Germany. Her work, however, never
received broad public acclaim, and the bestowal of the prize set off
angry criticism. While the political nature of her other publications
was debated, both the poet's supporters and defamers regarded <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> primarily as a volume of otherworldly spiritual and lyric
expression that distanced its author from modern daily life rather than
constructing her response to it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a 1937 letter from Palestine, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler declared "I am
unpolitical," a statement that would have been believable to many of her
contemporaries. This letter, however, was written under the circumstances
of her wanting desperately to return to Switzerland where she felt less
isolated than in Jerusalem; Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler had an immediate stake
in asserting that her work did not criticize Europe's current political
structures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Her work would soon be banned by the Nazis, and critics already had
 been debating whether it was political for more than two decades.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Typical of one side of this debate was Ernst Lissauer's 1913
 description: "this poetry lives surrounded by Central Europe's machines
 'like a heavenly stranger,'" or Camill Hoffman's 1919 reference to
 Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler as "the absolute poet, completely unbourgeois,
 untroubled, fairy tale being!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Yet others represented her as significantly political. For example,
 Wieland Herzfelde writes that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
did not want to create a new mythology; she strove instead far more
against the widespread myth of the Hohenzollern regime: "One becomes
human at the rank of Lieutenant." Her full elevation of the artist to
self-ruler was a manifestation against the spirit of submission, against
the division of society and of the races into super-
and subhumans,
against the worthlessness not only of artists and poets but no less of
the "common people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a different medium, Hannah H&ouml;ch makes a similar claim; by
placing a picture of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's head directly across from
the wheel of machinery on Wilhelm II's breast in a 1916 photomontage,
H&ouml;ch suggests that the poet stands in opposition to the military
industrialism of the Kaiser's reign. Below her and in the middle of the
montage, K&auml;the Kollwitz's head floats above the headless body of the
famous dancer Nidda Impekoven, suggesting that H&ouml;ch linked these
female artists in opposing Wilhelmine values and life--a battle, as it
were, of art against patriarchal, monarchical militarism. The women's
decapitation suggests the violence of this opposition (and perhaps of
contemporary misogyny), and the title of H&ouml;ch's photomontage, "Cut
with the Kitchen Knife," suggests the disparity in weapons available to
the two genders (and to artists in contrast to the military): kitchen
knives rather than military weaponry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's politics was not merely academic
or internal to the artistic community. The poet was frequently beaten
on account of her bohemian, male-female clothing, her principles, and
her Judaism, a combination that made

<B></B>

her an easy target for the radical right. The <I>Marbacher Magazin</I>
gives evidence of particular beatings in 1923, 1931, 1933, 1934, and
1936, and there is strong evidence that these were not isolated occasions,
even in the 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Closer to the time of <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> on a trip to Munich
 shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler wore
 Arabian pants and a turban (as well as a sash in the colors of the
 German flag), knowing that the "mass hysteria" in the city against the
 Turks could make this dangerous. While it seems unlikely that she was
 indicating direct sympathy with Turkey (her ostensible reason would have
 been her personification as "Tino of Baghdad" or "Prince Yussuf"), such
 clothing also marked her chosen identification with a population that
 at the time was even more marginalized than the Jews.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 According to Wieland Herzfelde, she was heckled constantly in Munich
 because of her clothing and arrested four times.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Throughout her life, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler faced ridicule and physical
 punishment for manifesting her principles openly, but despite bruises
 and even broken bones, she did not modify her dress, behavior, or values
 to fit others' norms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly, the debate about Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's political
positioning has continued to thrive. During the 1960s, Werner Kraft
claimed Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler "was basically an unpolitical being" while
Paul P&ouml;rtner argued that "She was political in the same way she
wrote: spontaneously and with fantasy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Writing in the 1980s, Bauschinger provides evidence for both sides. She
 claims there is no evidence of the poet's protest against the monarchy
 or of her political leanings, but also argues that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
 <I>Der Malik</I> (1919 [The king]) and her poems to friends who died
 in military service did indirectly protest against World War I. She
 also notes that the poet published regularly in <I>Die Aktion,</I>
 a leftist journal critical of the monarchy and the war. Bauschinger
 distinguishes, however, between the poet's revolutionary ideas and acts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Critics who note Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's lack of political involvement argue
on the basis of her writing's content, while those who maintain that her
work was political argue on the basis of her general principles and life
or her prose works. No discussion has focused on Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
critique of the dominant ideologies of her era within her poetry or
considered any aspect of social critique central to <I>Hebrew Ballads.</I>
Generally, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poetry has been read as exceptional,
different in intent as well as form from that of her contemporaries whose
critiques were more pointed or were explicitly theorized in essays. As
stated previously, however, I find that in particular the 1914 <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> constructs an implied social structure pointedly alternative
to that of Wilhelmine Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the opening poem of this volume, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler asserts her
dissatisfaction with the degeneracy and passionlessness of bourgeois
culture through the irregular rhyming, aural echoing, and highly
compressed syntax of a lament "sung" by a poet fleeing her connection
with an unidentified "decaying" people who are referred to in the poem's
title as "My People" (<I>Mein Volk</I>):

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is a poem of both community and alienation; the speaker sings "songs
of God" (<I>Gotteslieder</I>) that stem from and echo the crumbling rock
of "My People" even as she rushes from it and its stream of "blood." At
the end of the poem, it is ambiguous whether the decaying rock cries out
the words "my folk" or whether the rock and the people are analogous
and what they cry remains unspoken. This syntactic ambiguity restates
the poet's ambivalent positioning, since she, like the rock, literally
cries "<I>Mein Volk</I>" (the poem itself) even while the rock serves
primarily as a metaphor for the people the poet flees. Especially in a
period of intense nationalism, the poem suggests the poet's ambivalence
about belonging to that archetypal German body, "<I>das Volk,</I>" at the
same time that it may redefine her "<I>Volk</I>" as Jewish. <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> begins, then, with a speaker singing songs that are her
own but that echo those of a people to whom she both does and does
not belong. The other poems of the volume can be read as representing
these echoes of the tradition she honors and flees, whether it is
Hebrew as indicated by the volume's title or German as suggested by the
language. Despite this echoing, the volume's later poems also construct
an alternative ancestral past, apparently undecayed, to which the poet
can give full allegiance--in this case, a pacifist, creative, loving,
erotic, and German Judaism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless, the first poem's images of decay suggest loss and
 encroaching death rather than the beginning of anything.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Hebrew Ballads</I> ends with a poem similarly lamenting loss, although
this poem is paradoxically called "In the Beginning" (<I>Im Anfang</I>),
which recalls a playfulness that suggests a more vital past, and hence
perhaps a more hopeful future than "My People." In a move that could be
read as a sign either of the degeneracy of the present or of hope for a
progression toward the future different from that of the scriptural past,
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler also contrasts the speaker of her poem to Genesis,
which its title echoes. In her "In the Beginning," no omnipotent,
omniscient God speaks but rather a roguish poet who is coeval with
the creator:

When the world was still a child

And God still a young father.

Swung, hey!

On the ether-ay,

And my wooly hair fluttered in ringel-ray.

Teased the tottering moon Grandpa,

Snacked on gold dust of the sun Mama,
<BR>
I locked Satan into heaven
<BR>
And God in smokey hell.
<BR>
They threatened with their biggest finger
<BR>
And made "klummbumm! klummbumm!"
<BR>
And so raced the whip-winds.
<BR>
But afterwards God laughed two thunders
<BR>
With the devil about my mortal sin.
<BR>
Would give ten thousand times earthly happiness
<BR>
To live once more so god-begotten,
<BR>
So god-protected, so open.

Oh yes,

As when I was still God's rascal. [<I>WB,</I> 167]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This poem is constructed around reversals, primarily the speaker's
locking Satan in heaven and God in hell. And in this childhood of the
world, God enjoys such games. Together, Satan and God shake their finger,
repeat a nonsense sound, and laugh at "mortal sin," but with that word
the tone of the poem changes. The past tense becomes conditional and
playfulness becomes nostalgia for that earlier, protected, rhyming
("<I>gottgeboren</I>"- "<I>gottgeborgen</I>") time of manifest being.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Above all, the speaker seems to look back to a period without strict rules
and authoritarian control where radical reversal is possible. While God
is a father who controls punishing winds and thunder, he is also mutable
and at least temporarily vulnerable: he has an age, can be locked up, and
laughs with both his rascal and the devil. This is no God of punishment,
anger, and jealous control. The reversal of God with Satan, moreover,
is repeated structurally at other levels; the adult female poet (herself
a mother, perhaps in parallel to God the young father) speaks as a male
youth (a <I>Schlingel</I>), and the mythically male sun and female moon
are reversed and familiarized respectively as mama and grandpa, completing
a family in which there is no traditional patriarch.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Clearly not bourgeois, the speaker is hatless, uninhibited, indecorous,
 without fear of reprisal. He is a rogue but was with God "in the
 beginning" and has the freedom to tease God and the planets like a
 favorite son.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both "My People" and "In the Beginning," with their isolated speakers
and historical perspectives of loss or nostalgia, remind readers of
the "decaying" social fabric or "cliff" of the present world and these
speakers's isolation in it, thereby framing the rest of the volume's
representations of the past with this starkly inadequate present. In
some ways the loss expressed in these poems remains the dominant note
of the volume. Both poems are also typical of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
verse in their compression to the point of occasional ungrammaticality
or grammatical coinage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 This effect
of extreme density suggests the shorthand of internal monologue or
speech to a

<B></B>

 familiar audience. In both poems, the compressed sharpness
of the paratactic progressions from one image or aspect of metaphor to
the next, combined with the extravagance of the metaphors themselves,
prevent potentially sentimental images from falling into banality. These
are poems of rich aural resonance, shifting rhythms, and the expressive
density of multiple syntactic deletions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 With none of the looseness or narrative clarity of a traditional
 "ballad," these poems present cryptic pieces of a story, but not the
 story Jewish or Christian readers might expect, given the titles of
 the poems and of the volume. Similarly, the well-known speakers and
 subjects of many other poems in the volume--Abraham, Joseph, Ruth,
 David, Eve--present a moment or aspect of their stories generally quite
 different from the emphasis of the scriptural tales through which they
 are known.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While never in the foreground of <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> gender issues are
central to its unexpected formulations, and it is in the realm of gender
that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler herself fits least into the prescribed categories
of her time. As suggested by her first-person "<I>Schlingel</I>" in
"In the Beginning," Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler is as likely to speak in a
masculine as in a feminine guise and celebrates aspects of what in her
time was considered "feminine" behavior through both male and female
speakers. Gender, for her, was a flexible category while in Wilhelmine
Germany, generally, gender norms were rigidly essentialized. To
take an extreme but influential example, in <I>Sex and Character</I>
(<I>Geschlecht und Charakter</I>), Otto Weininger writes that woman's
entire meaning and purpose (<I>Bedeutung</I> and <I>Zweck</I>) lie in
sexuality, specifically in coupling (<I>in der Kuppelei</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Whereas men are characterized primarily by spirit/mind (<I>Geist</I>),
 women have no free will, no soul, no ego, in fact no consciousness
 at all ("M[an] lives consciously, w[oman] lives unconsciously"
 [<I>M[ann] lebt bewu&szlig;t, W[eib] lebt unbewu&szlig;t</I>])
 (<I>GC,</I> 144). "Genius," Weininger writes, "presents itself as a
 type of higher masculinity, and therefore women cannot be geniuses"
 (<I>GC,</I> 142); moreoever, because the historical sense is linked
 to consciousness and genius, women also do not have the property of
 historical perspective. One sees the broad concern with this topic and
 the significance of Weininger's work in a five-part 1918 essay by Ford
 Madox Ford, "Women and Men," one part of which discusses Weininger's
 claims. Ford finds Weininger's work largely "nonsensical," but he
 states that as early as 1906 it was talked about as a "new gospel" in
 "men's clubs" of England, France, Germany, and the U.S.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ford was critical of this "gospel," but many were not. For example,
Herwarth Walden, one of the most influential editors and supporters
of experimental arts in Berlin and Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's husband from
1903 to 1913, published misogynistic material in <I>The Storm</I>
(<I>Der Sturm</I>), including pieces written by Weininger and by
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's friends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Foremost among these was Karl Kraus, the Austrian satirist, whom
 Bauschinger notes was among the most trusted of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
 friends and whose enthusiastic support of Weininger was key to
 Weininger's popularity among the avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler dedicated both the 1913 and 1914
editions of <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> to Kraus and called his journal <I>The
Torch</I> (<I>Die Fackel</I>) "a

 Bible <I>f&uuml;r sich.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Kraus was an important supporter of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poetry; in
 1911, for example, he called her "An Old Tibetan Rug"

In 1927, Kraus wrote that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler was "the most significant
lyric poet in Germany today."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Yet Kraus also wrote that "the female has as much mind as a mirror
 has body," and Barbara Wright considers Kraus's <I>Die Fackel</I> one
 of the most virulent journals publishing against women's emancipation
 during the 1910s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
According to Wright, especially from 1911 to 1914, Expressionists
wrote enthusiastically about women's "nature"; these essays, she finds,
reveal a "clear perception of the need for reform in numerous areas of
contact between the sexes" but the majority "stand in open or implicit
disagreement with the goals of the women's movement" ("NM," 587).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 In the Expressionist community, which included her (ex)husband and
 friends, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler would have been surrounded by men who
 believed in women's spiritual, mental, and moral inferiority, no matter
 how highly they praised her sketches, painting, and literary production.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The prevailing essentialized attitudes toward gender were reflected in
the legal and social circumstances of women's lives. For example, women
in Germany were prohibited from higher public education for much longer
than in England or the United States: the first girls' <I>Gymnasium,</I>
a high school granting a pre-university degree (<I>Abitur</I>), was not
founded until 1893, and women were not admitted into degree programs at
German universities until 1908.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Similarly, until 1908, women were legally barred from all forms of public
 political activity. Women's daily circulation in the public realm was
 also circumscribed; a much disputed law gave police the right to arrest
 and jail any woman alone on the streets after dark and to examine her
 to determine whether she carried communicable diseases.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler, who spent much of each day and nearly every evening
 in cafes or at gatherings or performances, openly flouted the bourgeois
 conventions underlying such legislation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is no coincidence that such attitudes coincided with a high point
of activity in German women's movements. Yet, while bourgeois and
working class women's leagues had successfully promoted various legal
and educational reforms, even radical leagues tended to maintain the
concept of essential difference, in contrast with similar groups in the
United States and England at the time. The Jewish Women's League, while
more liberal in some respects than Protestant and Catholic leagues,
was also decidedly bourgeois and focused on activities women might
perform to strengthen the Jewish community that were appropriate to
their gender role.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Consequently and paradoxically, while their positions were dramatically
 opposed on particular issues having to do with women's rights and
 sexuality, most women's
leagues, popular culture, and the Expressionist community were in broad
agreement

<B></B>

 about the fact of essential gender differences. No major female
artist wrote essays in support of full psychological and spiritual, as
well as the more frequently debated sexual and civil, equality for women
to counter the din of misogynistic voices.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given her determined rejection of a bourgeois life and values and
her open flexibility about gender boundaries in several aspects
of her behavior and in her artistic self-understanding, it is not
surprising that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler manifested little sympathy for
either Christian or Jewish women's leagues or general bonding with
women as a community. Rather than joining other women in struggling
for education, social reform, and legal rights, she constructed her own
rules for behavior. In the predominantly masculine bohemian spheres, she
appeared as the regal, foreign, adolescent, either androgynous or male
"Prince Yussuf of Thebes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Between 1910 and 1917, this role dominated Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
 fiction and letters, and although Yussuf does not appear in <I>Hebrew
 Ballads,</I> the poet wrote to Jethro Bithell that she was both its
 David and its Joseph.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 At the same time, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler wrote poems celebrating the
 work of female friends, for example the sculptor Milly Steger and
 the painter Marianne von Werefkin, and in many letters she describes
 herself as interchangeably male and female or admires such flexibility
 in others--for example a maid "who used to be a boy."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The increasing nationalism and militarism of the early 1910s was as
pervasive as gender essentialism in determining the social and political
fabric of the time and certainly emphasized that the public realm was
male. Moreover, most liberal German women's groups supported both the
nationalistic prewar enthusiasm for military expansion and the war
itself. The League of Jewish Women participated in such support as did
the Jewish middle and upper classes generally. Before the outbreak of
the war, much of the artistic avant-garde was similarly militaristic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Ernst Bloch, for example, saw war as desirable since it would lead
 to an apocalyptic redemption of German and Jewish society through
 the destruction of the bourgeois mentality; to his mind, chaos and
 fragmentation (whether aesthetic or actual) prompted the viewer to
 "imagine and desire a new utopian future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 In a general study of Expressionist visions of apocalypse, Klaus Vondung
 sees several Expressionists writing before 1914 about their "aesthetic
 desire for power and destruction"; for example, in "Feeling Cramped"
 ("<I>Beengung,</I>" 1910) Johannes R. Becher states that "we . . . laze
 around on high desk chairs / And crumble anxiously into flour dust in
 waiting rooms . . . and wish thereby for a great world war."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 In 1914, Thomas Mann writes, "How the artist, the soldier in the artist,
 would have praised God for the collapse of the peaceful world, with
 which he was so fed up, so utterly fed up. War! We found it cleansing,
 freeing, and a monstrous hope. Of this the poets spoke, only of this."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 This enthusiasm also took pragmatic form; among others, Oskar Kokoschka,
 Rudolf Leonhard, Franz Marc, and Ernst Toller volunteered for military
 service once the war began. Although not isolated in her pacifism while
 writing <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler
was clearly at odds with the prevailing attitudes among fellow artists
and in German and Jewish popular culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once the brutality of the war made itself evident, few Expressionists
continued to support the war. Interestingly, however, both their prewar
militaristic visions and their later opposition assumed a community
of like-minded, implicitly or explicitly male comrades and frequently
used military language. One sees such brotherhood in the quotations
above. Since relatively small numbers of women attended universities
in Germany in 1911, the "we" lazing around on desk chairs in Becher's
poem would most likely be male, just as Mann's "soldier in the artist"
was. Using much the same language, in 1917, Alfred Henschke writes to
"the silver sons" of God, "legionnaires of the holy army" who must bring
"a new humanity" and peace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Whether for peace or war, brotherhoods would both carry out and benefit
 from this sense of purpose and spiritual cleansing in the name of God
 or some other spirit or power higher than their own. In 1917, Ernst
 Wilhelm Lotz coined the term "brother poetry" (<I>Bruderverse</I>) for
 intense poems of masculine comradeship.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Hermann Korte describes the "verse of the 'brother-poetry'" as
 "celebrat[ing] the men's club of sworn cameraderie in the light of
 visions of human and world redemption" ("MH," 28).
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 In contrast, he sees Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's dedication poems and
 poems of male love as opposing "the bloody seriousness of the
 '<I>Bruderverse</I>'" ("MH," 28).
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Eschewing the proclamation style reminiscent of the "all too masculine
 ritual of shoulder slapping," the "ex-cathedra tone," and "grandstanding
 rhetoric," Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's speakers are playful, tender, and
 intimate. Her portraits "strive to be poems, not monuments" ("MH," 29).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly given the widespread Jewish acculturation in Germany,
Jewish writing of the period outside the Expressionist community also
tended towards apocalyptic and monumental brotherhood. Particularly
through Zionism, as promoted by Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau, one saw
the rise of a distinctively masculine re of a "New Jew," created in
part as a counterimage to the anti-Semitic equation of Jewishness with
femininity (<I>GA,</I> 142). According to Hyman, the Zionists promoted
"male solidarity as an essential precondition for nation building"
(<I>GA,</I> 143).
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 While Zionism represented an extreme form of such beliefs, many Jewish
 men constructed similar notions of gender division "through a more
 oblique version of sexual politics" (<I>GA,</I> 150). It is relevant
 to remember in this context that Otto Weininger was Jewish and that his
 notion of the Jew as "feminine" and the "feminine," or woman, as inferior
 stemmed from related cultural beliefs of essentialism and natural
 hierarchy. <I>Bruderverse</I> and Zionist brotherhood were outgrowths
 of and responses to linked ideologies of race, gender, and nationhood.

While the first two decades of the twentieth century were relatively
open to Jewish assimilation, the depression of the 1890s, along with the
extremely rapid modernization and industrialization of the 1870s and
1880s, had occasioned a wave of anti-Semitism in the 1890s, which was
most strongly felt in Berlin and certainly reminded the Jewish community
of its marginal status in Germany. In 1893, Adolf Stoecker's anti-Semitic
political party, centered in Berlin but stemming from Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
 native Westfalia and active during her youth, won several
seats in the legislature.

 As Jakob Hessing writes and as one sees in Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's play
 <I>Arthur</I>
 
<B></B>


 <I>Aronymous</I> and essay "Anti-Semitism," local anti-Semitic
 enthusiasm was a part of her childhood. According to Hessing, it was
 in part for this reason that Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler was more sensitive to
 anti-Semitism and Jewish marginality than many other Jews. At the same
 time, she identified too closely with German culture to be satisfied
 with the boundaries of traditional Judaism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Ironically, then, this greater sensitivity to her Jewishness was one
 of the factors distancing the poet from assimilated Jews as well as
 from the Christian-German community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Situated among these multiple and overlapping communities tolerating or
supporting doctrines of female intellectual and spiritual inferiority,
essentialized gender difference, powerful male bonding, militarism,
nationalism, and anti-Semitism, Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler wrote and
published <I>Hebrew Ballads.</I> With this context in mind, its patterns
of unhierarchical relationships are striking. Immediately following
"My People" in the volume, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler turns to the theme of
human relationships to God depicting three types of blessed being, each
constructing an aspect of her mythologized past. First, in "Abraham und
Isaac," the patriarch "practice[s] talking with God" ("<I>&uuml;bte
sich mit Gott zu reden"</I>) and enjoys regular visits from angels
(<I>WB,</I> 157). When these angels are disturbed by the "bleating of
the tortured rams / With which Isaac played at sacrifice behind the
licorice trees," God admonishes Abraham, who in response readies an
altar and carries Isaac there (<I>WB,</I> 157). At this point the poem
breaks off with a dash, providing only the final cadenced line: "But
God loved his servant" ("-- / <I>Der aber liebte seinen Knecht</I>")
(<I>WB,</I> 158). The presumed ensuing conversation between God and
Abraham at the altar, each "practiced" in communication, is left to
the imagination. Although the hierarchy is preserved (Abraham remains a
"servant"), the poem stresses the love between God and Abraham rather
than that between Abraham and his thoughtless or cruel son.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unlike Abraham, Jacob--in the poem called "Jacob"--is presented wholly
mythically. He is the wild "buffalo of his herd," who "ran to the ancient
forest on the rivers / Stilled there the blood of his monkey bites" and
then, "Through the tired ache in his bones / Sank low before the heavens,
feverish / And his ox-face created the smile" (<I>WB,</I> 158).
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Here the power of both the torment and Jacob's response to it is
 suggested by the significance of his creation--a smile, an expressive
 sign that distinguishes humans from other animals. Jacob gives birth,
 as it were, to the human through his creation of an expression only
 humans can make. "Esther," like "Jacob," describes its protagonist
 in ways only peripherally related to scripture. Unlike the wild and
 primitive Jacob, however, Esther is a social creature, manifesting a
 beauty so intense that wheat and spiritual celebration borrow their
 scent from her presence: "slender like a date palm / Her lips provide
 the scent of the wheat stalks / And the holidays that occur in Judah"
 (<I>WB,</I> 158-9).
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In the poem, Esther's stereotypically feminine distinction is to be
 desired and wondered at, a distinction that gives no sense of her
 courage in requesting that the king take back his order to kill the Jews,
although it does suggest her beauty's power. While Jacob creates the
smile, Esther's approach prompts a smile from the king--as the poet
explains it, "Because God 

<B></B>

watches over Esther everywhere" (<I>WB,</I>
158). These three poems model relationships with God involving various
forms of communication and various levels of independence: as a dutiful
patriarch open to verbal negotiation, as a wild man able to communicate
originally and expressively even in feverish exhaustion, and a woman
embodying a harmony with the natural and spiritual worlds so pervasive
that it lends them her fragrance, perhaps both a cause and result of
her success in saving the Jewish people from slaughter. God honors all
three, suggesting that there is no single model, or gender, of chosenness.

These poems are uncharacteristic of <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> however, since
none presents erotic or passionate love. Moreover, all are written in
the past tense, as though they present a historical backdrop for the
immediacy of more intense relationships. More typical is "Pharaoh und
Joseph," where, in the present tense, Joseph proudly relates that Pharaoh
has sent his women away and "rests [his king's head] on my shoulder /
That smells of grain" (<I>WB,</I> 159). Although "His eyes go and come,"

The lack of concluding question marks contributes to the final lines'
heaviness, suggesting that there is nothing Jonathan can do without
David's heart and songs, and indeed in the biblical story he will soon
die. This death in battle clearly does not result from his loss of David's
songs, but one might conclude that Jonathan's choice to be loyal to
his father Saul (who seeks David's death) rather than to his companion
(in Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poem, his lover) suggests the consequences
of inadequate commitment to the values of loving, friendship, and
creativity: while kissing, one should not also depart for battle. The
poem may challenge its readers to ponder how many Jonathans will soon
be asked to take leave of their Davids.

"Ruth" is a poem of anticipated love. Ruth speaks of herself as

curiously secondary even while she speaks. Yet Ruth presents herself
as desiring and constructing a situation that will make her a symbol of
courage and love. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler also emphasizes Ruth's importance

<I>Hebrew Ballads</I> does not depict women loving women, but the poem
"Eve" contains several elements of socially coded gender reversal. In
explicit contrast to Weininger's <I>Weib,</I> Eve is more conscious and
more historically minded than Adam; she is the "thousand-stemmed memory"
which "lie[s] heavily on your [Adam's] life" (<I>WB,</I> 162). While
referring to exile, Eve's words convey no apology or regret; she
describes herself as having a soul of "sprouting love" and "expelled
desire" and cherishes Adam's beauty and confusion: "your lips are of rosy
silk-softness / As were the blossoms of Eden's trees"; "you tremble in
anticipation / Don't know why your dreams groan // you have bowed your
head low over me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 In "Eden's Voice" (<I>Die Stimme Edens</I>), Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler even
 presents Eve as having "wrested the day" from God and created herself
 and her "Gotteseele" from her own womb (<I>WB,</I> 126). This portrait
 of Eve is entirely sympathetic, which is consonant with Jewish, not
 Christian, tradition. She reasons, keeps the complex historical record
 ("thousand-stemmed memory"), and has a "sprouting" soul. While Adam
 is beautiful, soft, afraid, and unknowing, she is erotically desirous,
 unafraid of the future, and a poet.

Like Esther's blessedness, this speaker's passion transforms her into
a part of the mythic Jewish landscape. To see the fading sunset is to
know Sulamith, to reflect on those erotic "holinesses" she learned, just
as to smell fresh wheat is to know Esther's fragrance. Each experience
is fleeting but will come again. As Eve represents memory and desire so
powerful they have been exiled, or Ruth the courage to choose exile at
a moment of loss, Sulamith represents the power of erotic passion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an era when writers like Otto Weininger and Karl Kraus were denying
even the consciousness of women, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's portrayal of
women as speakers and lovers honored by God and men at least claims an
equality of spirit and will for them, even if the manifestations of that
will remain largely within the realm of stereotypical spheres. Reading
the poems with an unidentifed speaker as if this speaker were the poet
herself (as in "My People" or the poems addressing God), the volume
provides greater evidence of complex female desire, intelligence, and
spirituality. Men and more traditionally depicted women (Esther, Ruth)
come early in the volume while "Eve" and "Sulamith" appear later in
poems addressing or depicting Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's (not the Jewish
tradition's) ideal God who is vital, playful, actively creative, and
approachable. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler makes these women less radical in
their life choices and independence than she herself was but also places
them in a world where there is at least a temporary resonance between
desire, expression, and the physical world. The fact that neither Eve
nor Sulamith addresses her lover by name also creates a strong continuum
between these poems of self-aware women celebrating human love and those
where an ungendered speaker intimately addresses God: "God, I love you,"
("<I>Gott, ich liebe dich</I>") the poet cries in "Zebaoth" (<I>WB,</I>
162) or "I'd like to eavesdrop near your heart" ("<I>Ich m&ouml;chte nah
an deinem Herzen lauschen</I>") in "To God" (<I>An Gott</I>) (<I>WB,</I>
160). Such speakers defy Wilhelmine gender categories of "woman" as the
merely sexual body and "man" as the creative, god-like spirit, just as
poems like "Pharaoh and Joseph" or "Jonathan and David" defy stereotypes
of masculinity by having men manifest and voice dependency and tender
longing and by linking their bodies (as well as women's) with the earth's
food, scent, and beauty.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even more strikingly, given their historical context, many poems involve
the union of foreigners or people of different social classes: Joseph
the Jewish slave lives in
exile in Pharoah's Egypt; David the young shepherd's son was ordered
to live in the palace of Jonathan's father, King Saul; Ruth begs as a
stranger in Boaz's field, as Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler emphasizes by calling her
"the foreign reaper" at the end of "Boaz"; Sulamith learned "holiness
es" from the angel Gabriel; and God is a different order

<B></B>

 of being from
humans even when at His most communicative. Other poems, "Jacob und Esau"
and "Moses und Joshua," present men of equivalent status but different
life choices and opportunities. Related to this communication or love
between those representing difference is a broader pattern of norm
breaking or reversal of expectations: God's mercy to Abraham; Pharoah's
love of Joseph instead of the "sweet scented" women; Boaz's love of the
foreign beggar; the king's smiling at Esther rather than punishing her
for her request; the transformation of Sulamith's sorrow into beauty
that fills the horizon; and the rascal's reversal of God's and Satan's
realms. Here social power expresses itself through love or affection,
generosity, and acceptance, bypassing the hierarchical boundaries it
would conventionally protect.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, social power is secondary to the power of expression in these
poems. Their speakers are the social underlings, the foreigners, the
exiles (Joseph, David, Ruth, the poet in relation to God), and their
words--not the status of their lovers--construct what is of value in the
relationship and the poem. The social hierarchy is not overturned, but
the openness of communication and the egalitarianism of love suggest
that it is of limited importance. Similarly, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler does
not overturn the hierarchy of gender norms, yet the strengths of her
female speakers and her own flexibility in adopting the male gender at
least unsettle them. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's women, like her men, live as
individuals of spirit and feeling.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's volume does not construct a democratic
world. Indeed, as her fantasies of kingship and the "crowning" of friends
in an imagined "Thebes" suggest in her novel <I>The King</I>, the poet
does not oppose the idea of monarchy or social inequality as such. Her
implied protest then is not against Wilhelm II as Kaiser but against
any ruler who (like Wilhelm) practices and promotes uses of power
inconsistent with those she praises in her poems. For example, while
in her volume a God, father, or king may command individual behavior
even to the point of potential sacrifice, he takes no delight in power
for its own sake and practices no wanton aggression. The volume's only
act of destruction (as opposed to the apparently natural decay of the
"rock-bone" of "My People") occurs in "Abel" and stands isolated in the
volume as the poet's protest against all acts of human brutality. The
speaker seems not only to ask Cain "Why did you kill your brother?" but
also to ask how any "you" might choose to destroy life when the rewards
for cherishing it are so rich. Every murder, the poet implies, injures
the world; Abel's "blood deeply stains the heavens" (<I>WB,</I> 164). For
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler, killing brings sorrow, not heroism, material gain,
or apocalyptic possibilities of new and greater life. Hence, while
not explicitly protesting against militarism, <I>Hebrew Ballads</I>
distinguishes itself sharply from the work of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
contemporaries in lamenting any loyalty that leads to war and refusing
to see war as enabling a later utopia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Love is the most powerful concern unifying the poems of <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> and unifying the individuals within poems, whether
between two men, a man and a woman, or an individual and God. This
love is spectacularly free of aggression, jealousy, or possessiveness,
which are among the most frequent themes of biblical and other love
narratives. Instead, it is erotic, tender, at times sorrowful, and
associated with the beauty

<B></B>

 and fecundity of nature. It does not
aggrandize the loving self and does not serve any other purpose or
master. Such bonding, especially in those poems where men love men,
stands in marked contrast to Expressionist <I>Bruderliebe</I> through its
manifestation of affectionate and erotic desire rather than exclusion and
superiority. These lovers do not monumentalize each other (and hence,
indirectly, themselves or the poet) but focus on intimacy. Moreover,
in two cases, these couples link Jew and Gentile, and the heroic
re of every poem, whether the socially powerful one or not, is
always Jewish in an age when Jewishness was broadly seen as weak or
"feminine." Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's heroes play, love, speak with God, and
"sing" poetry. They "practice speaking with" another, that is, engage
in dialogue, not commands, judgment, or manifesto making.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the idea of actual people only writing poetry and loving in
a troubled world--like that of 1914--would be frightening, the fact
that these res are or consort with rulers suggests that they have
constructed states--national and emotional--that make such behavior
appropriate as well as desirable. Hence they presuppose temporary
utopian moments or states. Within such moments, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler
does not portray the psychological complexity of adult love but models
an ideal of tenderness between people of different nations and unequal
power where the ostensibly less powerful is more honored (David, Joseph,
Ruth, and perhaps Eve).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through such depictions of love, Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler also proposes
radically egalitarian communication among unequals in place of the
prevailing hindrances to communication constructed by nationalism,
anti-Semitism, and misogyny. If there is even one exiled Joseph to shelter
the heart of the native Pharaoh in his "blood," both Egypt (or Germany)
and the Jews may survive, she suggests. One Esther can save the Jewish
people from extermination through her courage in speaking with the king
and because of his--and God's--love for her. And every Boaz can save an
alien Ruth from hunger and loneliness, and every Ruth can bring a Boaz
to spiritual and physical delight. The titles alone of several poems,
with their simply paired names, suggest dialogue and relationship rather
than hierarchy or event.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Legalistic judgment bows to affection and mercy in "Abraham und
 Isaac," and in "Jacob und Esau" the latter chooses to abandon his
 birthright rather than being tricked out of it, leaving both brothers
 satisfied. Even in "Abel," where the speaker condemns Cain's murder,
 the tone of the poem is sorrowful bafflement rather than blame or a
 stance suggesting moral superiority. Similarly, rather than a Nietzschian
 despair over a God that is dead, this volume's several poems addressing
 God suggest that divine presence is at worst temporarily withdrawn.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the dominant notes of the volume are erotic longing or
sorrowful loss, play is also an important element of the communication
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler represents in relationships and constructs through
word coinages, rhyme, and metaphor. The poet's participation in the
widespread association of play with youth again may reflect a hopefulness
about the future. Play that torments others (even sheep) is punishable,
while the play of friendship, love, or personal idiosyncratic wildness
marks the players'

<B></B>
 blessedness or creativity. As others have noted,
celebration of play marks several early twentieth-century works.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Most famously, Nietzsche writes in <I>Beyond Good and Evil</I>
 that perhaps we shall discover our inventiveness in "nonsense"
 (<I>Bl&ouml;dsinn</I>), that realm in which "we, too, can still be
 original, say, as parodists of world history and God's buffoons--perhaps
 even if nothing else modern has a future, precisely our <I>laughter</I>
 may yet have a future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 But whereas Nietzsche encourages a minimal hope--we may achieve
 the originality of parody--Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler moves towards greater
 affirmation with her non-parodic rewriting of the Jewish and Christian
 biblical past and her concluding "rascal" (<I>Schlingel</I>) rather
 than Nietszche's "buffoon" (<I>Hanswurst</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Hebrew Ballads</I> challenges cultural norms through repeated modeling
of other, better life choices. In Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poems, unlike
in Wilhelmine Germany, personal love is valued above duty to a state
or political affiliation; women are honored equally with men, and love
as powerfully; poetry and creativity are valued above institutional or
inherited power and destructiveness; and teasing playfulness, including
the ability to laugh at oneself and at others, takes a higher place than
philosophy or intellectual understanding. A people and nation that play,
love, and cherish poetry do not define themselves through territorial
expansion, persecution of "alien" others, or divisive reason. Mikhail
Bakhtin puts theoretically what Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poems imply:

The serious aspects of class culture are official and authoritarian; they
are combined with violence, prohibitions, limitations and always contain
an element of fear and of intimidation. . . . Laughter, on the contrary,
overcomes fear, for it knows no inhibitions, no limitations. Its idiom
is never used by violence and authority.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the volume's emphasis on love and play, readers in
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's time would have understood its values as
"feminine." The crucial distinction, however, is that precisely these
values in Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poetry link the human being with God
and hence constitute human soul (<I>Geist</I>), the highest of the
qualities assumed by her culture to be "masculine" and the single quality
associated most fully with genius and the divine. In this sense, <I>Hebrew
Ballads</I> instructs its readers in values more becoming to a people
claiming divine preference or right, whether that <I>Volk</I> is Jewish
or German, than those of militaristic and masculinist Wilhelmine Germany.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By titling her volume <I>Hebrew Ballads,</I> Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler veils
the poems' contemporary significance. As "ballads" the poems suggest the
romance of an earlier, simpler time. As "Hebrew" ballads, they suggest
both a specificity in relation to traditional
 Judaism that the volume does not deliver and a distance from Christian
 culture that is equally misleading. The speakers and protagonists of
 these poems belong to the most familiar cultural stories for Jewish and
 Christian readers, even though the actual moments portrayed are mostly
 apocryphal. In this sense "Hebrew" functions not to orientalize or
 defamiliarize the tradition but to foreground a common inheritance. The
 form and manner of the poems are misleading as well. More love lyrics
 than ballads
 
<B></B>

 in genre, the poems appear to retreat into the private
 realm even while celebrating a homo-
and heterosexual, male and female
 tenderness and eroticism that were hotly debated along lines of gender,
 morality, and psychology at the time. The fantastic images and (according
 to one's perspective) either inaccurate or revisionary representation of
 biblical res--Jacob as a buffalo, Pharaoh and Joseph as lovers, a
 speaker who swings on clouds and can trick God without punishment--may
 suggest that the volume is pure fantasy with no relation to a world
 careening wildly toward war and revolution. Yet as Peter-Klaus Schuster
 comments in his essay on Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's exchange of drawings
 with Franz Marc, "the pursuit of the miraculous is a gesture of
 defiance, and it is the only way to prevail over reality" (<I>DS,</I>
 49). Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's work is not miraculous, but fantasy is key
 to her inventiveness. <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> does not take an already
 defined side in the political battles of its day, but its patterns of
 alternative modeling are clear. The National Socialists, then, may have
 been more accurate readers than many of Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's friends
 in recognizing that her work was indeed "hostile" to prevailing German
 assumptions, in 1914 as well as in the 1930s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's fantasy in this volume and in her prose is
undeniably utopian, but, for her, no vision of utopia, whether past or
future, can be sustained. In the mythic past of her wild Jews, Cain kills
Abel, Jonathan chooses to follow his father into battle, and Moses dies
in what appears to be heart-wrenching prayer. Moreover, the despair of
"My People" is answered only through representations of this mythic
past, leaving the volume's opening scene of decay and flight intact in
the present. The volume's conclusion can also be read more as a question
than as a response to the questions of the first poem. In the world's
beginning, human mischievousness or disobedience was part of a cosmic
joke that caused laughter. In contrast, now that God has aged and humans
no longer enjoy the status of favored "rascals," the poem may raise the
question of what will happen when humans again get it wrong, for example,
when they again imagine Satan in heaven and God in hell.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most utopian moment of <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> comes in the poem
"Reconciliation" (<I>Vers&ouml;hnung</I>), where the speaker prophesies
at the poem's beginning and end that "A great star will fall in my
lap"--perhaps the star of Judaism itself (<I>WB,</I> 166). This hint
of maternity, however, is contradicted by the poem's representation of
humans as scared, tired children, and the play in the poem's title, which
echoes "<I>Vers&ouml;hnungstag</I>" or Yom Kippur. Perhaps with this
poem Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler wants to suggest that even though suffering,
or having greatly sinned, the Jewish people will again attain a grace
in which "God overflows."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 The poem may also refer to the destructive divisions of prewar Germany
 and the consequent need for "reconciliation"
 or "atonement." This is the strongest utopian moment of the volume, but
 the fact that it is followed by "Moses und Joshua"--a poem ending with
 Moses' death before entering Canaan, "As his tired lion's soul cried out
 to God"--suggests the apocalyptic nature of its prophecy (the speaker
 claims "When we embrace, we do not die") (<I>WB,</I> 167). The "great
 star" may fall only when all Jews return from their wandering to this
 promised land. The future's promise in this sense seems less hopeful
 
<B></B>


 than the idea that the thought of "reconciliation" (or the practice of
 Yom Kippur) can bring humans to overcome their fears and "embrace." In
 her fiction, where Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler is most explicit in constructing
 a fantasy world, utopia also most explicitly cannot be sustained. For
 example, in <I>The King,</I> Prince Jussuf commits suicide at the end,
 unable to face his own loneliness, losses, and mistakes. While there
 is no such final despair in <I>Hebrew Ballads</I>, the poet embeds
 her poems of utopia among others powerfully lamenting isolation and
 loss. The volume's expression of hope and despair suggests how qualified
 her faith is that the world she can imagine might be realized.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The political focus of <I>Hebrew Ballads</I> is a zeitgeist, not a
specific event or person. Hence perhaps the volume is difficult to
place politically. Eavan Boland writes of "the confusion of the public
and the political" in Irish poetry and defines the political poem as
"a continuing action which revises, in some decisive way, the perceived
relation of power between an inner and outer world."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 What Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler writes is simultaneously a public
 (religious) history and a fantasy. Without addressing public issues of
 the social or national sphere, her work revises the perceived relations
 of power in the world it constructs as an alternative to that in which
 the poet lives.

Because Yussuf never grows to manhood and Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler marks
herself as "feminine" through jewelry even when dressed as Yussuf,
as well as celebrating female sexuality in her writing, "androgynous"
seems a more accurate category than "male" for the poet. This idea is
widely circulated among Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler scholars; see <I>DS,</I> 71;
<I>ELS,</I> 118, <I>EW,</I> 117-20, and Kuckart, <I>Im Spiegel der
Bache,</I> passim). According to Kaplan, such bohemian dress would have
been seen as particularly improper within the Jewish bourgeois community,
which encouraged Jewish women to dress moderately in order not to call
anti-Semitic attention to themselves; see Kaplan, <I>Jewish Feminist
Movement,</I> 22, 201.

Becher, quoted in Klaus Vondung, "Mystik und Moderne: Literarische

Lotz had dedication poems from one man to another specifically in mind,
but the term is broadly applicable in this period. See Hermann Korte,

Korte even reads Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's poem "Franz Werfel" as an ironic
commentary on Johannes R. Becher's "hymn" to monumental brotherhood,
"To Franz Werfel" ("MH," 29). Loehner also sees Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler's
distance from what he calls the prevailing "comrades of mankind" strain of
Expressionism ("MH," 116). Retrospectively, one might also note the irony
in Gottfried Benn's dedication of <I>S&ouml;hne</I> [1913, <I>Sons</I>],
which is filled with the language of brotherhood, to Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT47" HREF="#REF47">47</A>.
Notions of brotherhood may also be related to the active public support
for male homosexuality among the German-speaking avant-garde. According
to Wright, for example, Alfred Wolfenstein championed the rights of
male homosexuals, as did Rudolf Leonhard (both were Jewish Expressionist
poets), and in 1910 Kraus published an essay in Walden's <I>Der Sturm</I>
claiming that "'acquired homosexuality' . . . is the right of ethically
and aesthetically superior men" (quoted in "NM," 590). During the teens
and early 1920s, Berlin seems to have provided the kind of center for
gay men that Paris did for lesbians.

In <I>Oldnewland</I> (<I>Altneuland</I>), Herzl gives women
political equality with men but has them choose exclusively
domestic occupations. Nordau popularized the term "muscular Jewry"
(<I>Muskeljudentum</I>) and emphasized physical strength in Zionism's
"manliness"; see <I>GA,</I> 143-5. Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler admired Herzl
and praised him in her <I>Hebr&auml;erland,</I> also reporting there that
he called her an "angel," "one of the thirty-six just ones, holy people
transformed unknowingly on earth" (Herzl, quoted in Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler,
<I>Das Hebr&auml;erland</I> [Zurich: Oprecht, 1937]; reprinted in
