Sometime in the mid-1950s the Guyanese artist Aubrey Williams, a leading
member of Afro-modernism and black abstractionism, was introduced to
Pablo Picasso by Albert Camus during a visit to Paris. Given Williams's
association with various factions of cubism and his attempt to emulate its
style to capture the hybrid cultures of his native Guyana, the meeting
with the great artist was supposed to be a highlight of his career,
perhaps a catalyst for new directions in the troubled relation between
artists of African descent and the international avant-garde. But as it
turned out, the meeting between Williams and Picasso, far from being an
ephiphanic encounter, was to be remembered as anticlimactic:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
There was nothing special about meeting Picasso. It was a meeting like
many others, except that meeting Picasso was a big disappointment. It was
a disappointment for stupid little things: I didn't like how he looked;
I didn't like how he behaved. I never thought I would not like people
like that. But the total of the whole thing is that <i>I did not like
Picasso.</i> He was just an ordinary past-middle-aged man. I remember
the first comment he made when we met. He said that I had a very fine
African head and he would like me to pose for him. I felt terrible. In
spite of the fact that I was introduced to him as an artist, he did not
think of me as another artist. He thought of me only as something he
could use for his own work.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Williams's disappointment may have arisen from a sense of heightened
expectation about the master, or even the hurt that came from not being
recognized as a fellow artist, but what stands

<b></b>

out in this description of the encounter is that what Picasso found
most enchanting about the Guyanese painter was a "fine African head,"
he valued as a model for art. Williams was disappointed that he was
appealing to Picasso merely as an object or subject of art, not as
an artist, not as a body, not even as a human subject. And yet, it is
possible that this disappointment arose because Williams had assumed,
as many historians of art have assumed over a century of modernism, that
because Picasso was the most important re in primitivism, the movement
in art when the Other, often black or brown, became a catalyst for modern
art, that he must have had some respect for the cultures and bodies that
had made modernism possible. How else could one make other cultures and
subjects the sources of art, the agents of the major breakthroughs we
have come to associate with modernism, unless one also valued the people
who produced it? We now know, of course, that the relationship between
Picasso and his African sources was much more complicated than Williams
might have assumed. Indeed, the fascination with the "fine African head"
did not simply reflect the insensitivity of an artist past middle age;
on the contrary, Picasso's relationship to Africa, or his investment in
a certain idea of Africa, which is evident from his early career to his
high cubist period, was a meticulous attempt to separate the African's
art from his or her body, to abstract, as it were, those elements of
the art form that would serve his purpose at crucial moments in his
struggle with established conventions of Western art. This is the gist
of the argument I want to present in this essay.
<p>
Much has been written on Picasso and primitivism but little on his
specific engagement with Africa. Indeed, a major part of the argument I
will be presenting here demands a separation of primitivism, as a now
canonized idea in the history of modernism, from African cultures and
bodies. Picasso loved the idea of the primitive and tribal, but his
relationship with the cultures and peoples of Africa and Oceania was
more ambiguous. We are told, by Andr&eacute; Malraux, among others, that
Picasso was irritated by "the influences that the Negroes had on me" even
as he eloquently discussed the magical influence of those African objects
discovered at the Old Trocad&eacute;ro on that fateful day in 1906.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
In most of his reflections on the "Negro" influence he seemed careful
to make distinctions between the effect or affect of African objects
and cultures. When he talked about the "Negro," he was talking about
the object rather than the person.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The fact that Picasso had an intimate relationship with African objects
is not in doubt; but there is little evidence of an interest in Africans
as human beings and producers of culture beyond his general interest
and involvement in anti-colonial and other radical movements. Indeed,
as Williams discovered in that encounter in Paris in the 1950s, Picasso
seemed to be meticulous in his separation of objects of art from bodies,
and it is my contention that it was in this division of bodies from
artistic models that the African could be cleansed of its danger and thus
be allowed into what Aaran has aptly called "the citadel of modernism."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
It is now claimed that in order for modernism to claim its monumentality,
that is its enshrinement in the very institutions of Western culture and
museum culture that it had set out to defy and deconstruct, it had to
shed the contaminants of the Other as part of what D. A. Miller calls,
in a different context, its "routine maintenance."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
In fact, the debates that have come to define modernism, the custodial
commentaries on

<b></b>

its monumentality, tend to see it as the triumph of endogamy over exogamy,
of internal forces over external ones.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
It is remarkable that except in those instances when the topic at hand
is primitivism, the canonical narrative of modernism has little to say
about African sources.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Now, this absence can be explained in one of two ways: one could argue,
for instance, that the institutions of commentary have been so eager
to secure the purity of modernism, that they have become mechanisms
of surveillance against the danger that engendered it in the first
place. Africa is first acknowledged as a significant episode in the
history of modernism, and then it is quickly dispatched to the space of
primitivism, a place where it poses no danger to the purity of modern
art. However, there is a second, even more interesting explanation,
namely that the practitioners of modernism had themselves started the
process of containment, that they needed the primitive in order to carry
out their representational revolution, but that once this task had been
accomplished, the Other needed to be evacuated from the scene of the
modern so that it could enter the institutions of high art. How else can
we explain the paradox that runs throughout the history of modernism,
the fact that almost without exception the Other is considered to be part
of the narrative of modern art yet not central enough to be considered
constitutive? To put it more specifically, why is it possible to argue
simultaneously that the discovery of African and Oceanic art enabled
the moment of modernism yet claim that these works did not have a
fundamental influence in the shaping of modernism? From Daniel-Henry
Kahnweiler's dismissal of the "Negro influence" in the rise of cubism
to Pierre Daix's famous claim that "there is no 'Negro' in the <i>Les
Demoiselles d'Avignon,</i>" one of the greatest puzzles of modern art
is whether Africa has to be considered a categorical imperative in
the theory and practice of modern artists or just a passing fad in the
ideology of modernism.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
My discussion will proceed in a circuitous way, but it will focus, from
different directions, both on Picasso's entanglement with Africa and the
critics' and art historians' entanglement with this entanglement. My
goal is to show how understanding it&#8212;the entanglement that
is&#8212;is crucial to our rethinking of the aesthetic of modernism and
the schemata&#8212;and stigmata&#8212;of difference that both maintains
and haunts it.

<p>
Let us start with a basic question: is there an Africa in Picasso's
oeuvre? And if so, what form does it take? Is it the Africa of bodies
or art forms, of material culture or abstracted ideals? At first sight
this might appear to be a banal question, especially when we recall
the countless debates surrounding the influence of Africa as the mark
of Picasso's modernist breakthrough and, inevitably, the centrality of
primitivism in his aesthetic practices. But this old question needs to
be posed because with few exceptions, the major studies of the African
influence in Picasso, whether for or against it, are explorations
of the influence of certain African art objects on Picasso's work,
or generalized explorations of how African art objects, discovered at
the Old Trocad&egrave;ro, triggered the "terror" that made modernism
possible. The terms of reference in these studies tend to acknowledge
the African influence and to dispose of it in the same

<b></b>

breath, either by confining "Africanisms" to the realm of psychological
fear or artistic structure. What these approaches seem to do, even in
their detailed and meticulous study of "Africanisms" in Picasso, is also
to minimize what I am calling the constitutive role of Africa in the
making of modernism. In 1948 Kahnweiller would, in a single bold gesture,
testify to the modernist's heavy interest in Negro Art and still proceed
to "dispute the validity of the thesis of a direct influence of African
art on Picasso and Braque."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
In 1984, William Rubin would provide perhaps one of the most detailed
explorations of the influence of primitive art on Picasso's major works
and still conclude that tribal sculpture did not have a constitutive
role in the shaping of his art.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
From the moment Picasso began to be canonized as the most important
painter of the modern period in the 1940s, the institutions of
interpretation have been anxious to minimize or dismiss any direct and
determinative correlation between his works and the tribal objects that
surrounded him as he undertook the project of making art modern. Where
the influences of the tribal seem self-evident, they are redefined
as "convergences" (by Kahnweiller), "affinities" (by Rubin), or
"connotations" (by Bois).
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
My interest here is to probe the reasons for this anxiety of
influence. What threat does the acknowledgement of correlativity between
the modern and its Others pose? What is the basis of the hauntology
that has come to define the moment of modernism and Western high culture
in general?
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Elsewhere I have argued that one of the unifying characteristics of
the aesthetic ideology that has emerged in Europe since the eighteenth
century, is its concern with Others as the enabling conditions of
beauty, taste, and judgment and, simultaneously, with the counterpoints
or opposites of these conditions. If art has come to function as the
defining point of cultural achievement and civilization, it is only
because it functions within economies of desires and ideals&#8212;of
purity and a chaste culture&#8212;clearly distinct from the danger and
defilement represented by the Other and in need of defense from the
barbarism that necessitates taste.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Modernism presents an immediate challenge to this thesis because, its
overall economy, especially its adulation of primitivism, would seem to
posit the Other not as a threat that must be contained but as the source
of new energies. In 1919, T. S. Eliot declared that one could no longer
understand culture without knowing "something about the medicine-man and
his works": "As it is certain that some study of primitive man furthers
our understanding of civilized man, so it is certain that primitive
man and poetry help our understanding of civilized art and poetry."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
What is easy to miss in declarations such as this one is that the
primitive was a conduit to understanding "civilized" man, art,
and poetry, not an endpoint in itself; there was no incentive to
understand the Other unless it would lead to an understanding of Western
civilization either in its "childhood" or moments of crisis. Thus, Eliot
wanted his readers to comprehend something about the medicine-man so
that they could recognize the sensibility of the poet, "the most able
of men to learn from the savage."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Savagery and the artistic sensibility would intimately be connected
in the aesthetic of modernism; however, it did not follow that the
moderns were willing to give up civilization to become one with the
savage. Indeed, the relation between the modern and the savage was
defined by a dialectic of love and loathing, identity and difference. So
it is with Picasso and Africa.

<b></b>

Even in his "Negro" period, Picasso seemed to prefer the African art
object to the "uncultured" African body. Nevertheless, this preference
for the art object over the body was something that Picasso arrived
at in the process of working through his aesthetic ideology at certain
crucial phases of his career, beginning with his troubled relation to
academic art during his youth, his subsequent flirtation with "soft"
modernism, and culminating in the cubism that marked the revolution
in modern art. His oscillation between the African body and artwork
appears to be the symptom of a deep and continuous engagement with the
continent, the mythologies surrounding it, the fantasies it generated,
and ultimately the threat it posed to the idea of civilization that the
modernists both wanted to deconstruct and yet secure as the insignia of
white, European, cultural achievement.
<p>
Under these circumstances, it is best to begin a rethinking of Picasso
and the haunting of Africa by comparing his ration of the continent
in the years before his "Negro Period" (1906-1908) and the irruption of
modernism. It is useful to recall here that in the early years of his
career, Picasso was preoccupied with what Marilyn McCully has called
"classicizing subjects and forms"; he was primarily attracted to the
art forms of what he construed to be classical cultures, mostly Iberian
and Egyptian.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
It is important to note at the outset that he did not consider
"Negro Africa" to be part of this classical heritage or classicizing
impulse. The absence of Africa from Picasso's classicism suggests an
early awareness, on the artist's part, that the value of "Negro Africa"
as a model or source of art lay elsewhere; it could not be relegated
to antiquity nor could it be considered modern; rather it occupied a
middle space temporally located both in the childhood of mankind and
yet very much part of the living world. This understanding of Africa was
determined&#8212;and explained&#8212;by Picasso's Andalusian background
much more than his French sojourn. Indeed, as Natasha Staller has
shown, Picasso's engagement with the myth of Africa predates his 1904
move to Paris or his 1907 discovery of African art objects at the Old
Tr&oacute;cadero (<i>SOD,</i> 269-301).
<p>
My concern here, then, is the meaning of Africa in Picasso's
pre-primitivism period, especially the often forgotten fact that he was
the product of an Andalusia whose identity had historically been defined
against an African cartography, disconnected from the "dark" continent
by the Strait of Gibraltar but connected to it by history. This ambiguous
connection led to "a series of complex and ambivalent racial, religious,
and sexual stereotypes, and [to] the Malagueno myth of Africa, including
the belief that the defeat of Africa made one modern" (<i>SOD,</i>
269). Staller informs us that the defeat of the Moors entered Andalusian
consciousness as an epochal moment: "the middle ages ended on 18 August
1487"; it was understood "in terms of apocalyptic rupture&#8212;a
rupture explicitly understood in terms of modernity" (<i>SOD,</i>
271). The myth that Picasso inherited from this history was one in
which Africa was posited as the unmodern antithesis of the new Malaga:
to become modern was to break away from Africa. Modernity, rather than
classicism, defined what Picasso inherited&#8212;and resisted&#8212;as
tradition. Where does resistence fit into this narrative? Since Picasso
had to reject tradition in order to become an artist, or at least to
break away from the artistic traditions associated with his father, he
needed, paradoxically, to discover and valorize a counterpoint to the
modernity of Andalusia by inventing his own version of the unmodern. He

<b></b>

could seek this unmodern, first, in the classical tradition. But it
also seems, as scholars of his early works have noted, that a mastery
of classical models of painting, especially those concerning the human
form, would not enable a rupture in Western systems of representation;
after all, one of the uncanny moves of modernity was to embrace the
classical itself as the source of its civilizational authority.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
In this sense, it was significant that the Malagueno myth of the
modern was predicated not on a break from antiquity, but from the
Middle Ages, clearly associated with the Arabic, Moorish, and hence
African influences.
<p>
Aware, then, that the classical alone could not be valorized as the
alternative to the modern, Picasso's work in the early years turned to
the painting of the body in order to appropriate its classical form but
also to mark his difference from the inherited tradition. What stands
out in his transitional works from 1906 such as the <i>Two Nudes</i> (<A
NAME="1" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#1"> 1</a>)<b>,</b>
is what Margaret Werth has aptly described as a historical and formal
liminality.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Werth argues that the <i>Two Nudes</i> is liminal "in that it situates
itself between formal investigation and the archaic of primitive;
between materialization and dematerialization of the body; between
ration and disration; and between masculine and feminine."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
But I think this liminality is also the reflection of a deep
anxiety about tradition. On one hand, Picasso wanted to re
the body in the classical style, on the other hand, he wanted his
representation to be in excess of the conventions he had inherited;
and this excess is marked by his drawing of the human form out of
proportion and, more significantly, by his conversion of the face
to a mask. As the <i>Portrait of Gertrude Stein</i> (<a name="2"
href="10.3gikandi_res.html#2"> 2</a>), also painted in 1906,
was to illustrate, Picasso would turn to masking when he felt he had
failed to capture the human face even after numerous sittings.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
But if Picasso's goal was to break away from inherited
conventions&#8212;and the distortion of classical forms in the early works
seems to enforce this view&#8212;then there was an even more radical way
in which he could achieve the task of disration, that is, by turning
to Africa. We know, for example, that the artist inscribed his youthful
rebellion by claiming a Moorish identity. We also know that his adolescent
drawings are populated by Moorish res and subjects, representing the
danger of what I have called the "unmodern." These drawings represent
juvenile fantasies about the Moorish Other. In the late 1890s, however,
Picasso embarked on some academic paintings of the African body (<A
NAME="3" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#3"> 3</a>).
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
These paintings are important for two reasons. First, they represent
the first and only time that Picasso was interested in the corporeal
form of the African. After that, as I will show later, Picasso's
interest in things African, even during his so-called "Negro Period,"
was limited solely to art objects which came to stand in for Africa
itself. Second, in his academic paintings, Picasso perceived Africans
in a twofold relation: the African nude represented the body in its
"natural" state, one which was, nevertheless, out of proportion with the
"ideal" in long-established European notions about ways of representing
the human form in art. (These paintings reflected stereotypical notions
of the black's excessive sexuality; indeed, what made the black body, in
the form of the models Picasso was painting, compelling was its unusual
distortion.) In order to defy convention&#8212;in the <i>Two Nudes,</i>
for example&#8212;Picasso could draw the white body by drawing it out
of proportion. Now, it seemed, the black body

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 462]</b>

represented the corporal form out of order, even in nature, and hence
already in defiance of the laws of proportion and symmetry. In these early
paintings, the African's body, in its disproportional form and primitive
sexuality, would allow Picasso to kill two birds with one stone, both
classicism(which favored idealized bodies) and modern culture (which
was coy about male sexuality). Consequently, in this early phase of his
career, Picasso adopted African forms as a way of thinking through the
limitations of the forms of representation favored by the art academy,
namely a sense of order, proportionality, and idealization. The African
body formed the embodiment of disorder.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
There is, of course, great irony in this narrative of Picasso's early
relationship with the African: he was obsessed with African imageries
and bodies before he ever laid his eyes on any real Africans; while
when he first visited Paris in the year of the Universal Exhibition
of 1900 and encountered colonial Africans on display, blacks seemed, in
Staller's apt phrase, to slip off his "mental map" (<i>SOD,</i> 303). What
banished African's and Moors from Picasso's consciousness? Where did they
go? And why and how did they reappear in 1906? Behind these questions
lies the larger problem of the repressed in representation, for, to
twist the words of Fredric Jameson, it is precisely at the moment that
the object of analysis (reality, history, or even Africa) is repressed,
or its influence is denied, that "by a wondrous dialectical transfer the
historical "object" [Africa for my purposes] itself becomes inscribed
in the very form."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
But a probing of Picasso's political unconscious must be prefaced by two
additional factors. The first one is basic, namely that irrespective of
the form they would take in Picasso's work, from the phantasm in the
juvenile sketches to the abstractness of high cubism, African objects
were what he was later to call "<i>intercessors,</i>" instruments for
mediating the

<b></b>

kinds of forces, often unspoken and unlicensed, which he needed
in order to break through the edifice of modernity (<i>PM,</i>
11). Apparently, Africa was most useful to Picasso when it was confined
to the unconscious&#8212;there but not there&#8212;mediating other needs
and desires, while not serving as a primary faction in itself. From this
perspective, it would seem that when he was encountering real Africans
in Paris at the beginning of the twentieth century, they had nothing
useful to perform in his artistic project in their embodied form.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
The second factor to consider when probing Picasso's political unconscious
recalls what happened during his sojourn in G&oacute;sol in the summer
of 1906. Here I am interested not so much in what has been referred to
as Picasso's "regression to ethnic and primitive roots," or even in his
turn to female res as the intercessors of the primitive, but in his
valorization of this distortion and dissymmetry as part of his method
and signature.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
If the paintings at G&oacute;sol have one thing in common, it is
their intertextual and contrapuntal relation to previous works which
they acknowledge as part of their schema and yet displace in terms
of form and meaning. Picasso's primary goal in the "Blue Period"
(of which the stay at G&oacute;sol is exemplary) was the artistic
deformation of the European canon of painting. This goal could
best be achieved through the distortion of the white female form,
a subject or re whose ideality represented the classicism he was
ting against. This point is easily made through a comparison
of Picasso's The <i>Harem</i> and Ingres's <i>Turkish Bath</i>
(. <a name="4" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#4">4</a>
and <a name="5" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#5">5</a>)
and of his <i>Reclining Nude</i> and Goya's The <i>Naked Maja</i>
(. <a name="6" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#6">6</a> and
<a name="7" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#7">7</a>). What we
see in these repaintings of significant works in the European canon is
a reinstallation of established conventions of painting, a distillation
of formalized artistic subjects, and a transmutation of genres.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
But what does this repainting of European works have to do with
Africa? If we were to read <i>The Harem</i> in itself, as an isolated
object of reflection, or even in relation to Ingres's <i>Turkish
Bath,</i> perhaps nothing, for there is little in the painting that
points to Africa or the "Orient" as the primary referent. Treated
as autonomous objects what we have in front of us is one painting
(<i>Turkish Bath</i>) functioning as the intertext of another (<i>The
Harem)</i>. And yet from its title and implicit motif Picasso's
<i>Harem</i> does seem to echo the odalisque and this has led
commentators to read it in explicitly Orientalist terms.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Picasso encouraged this kind of reading by describing the quality of
the picture as that of "L'humanit&eacute; f&eacute;minin, la femme
d'Afrique."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Still, one wonders whether, this kind of strong Orientalist reading
is supported by the painting itself. One could argue that Picasso has
modernized the odalisque and thus distorted its terms of reference and
this may well have been his intention; nevertheless, compared to the
modernist Orientalism of, lets say Matisse, the "Eastern" referent is
weak and displaced.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
It could be said that in comparison to Matisse, Africanisms or
Orientalisms would be notable in Picasso's painting simply because
they were absent where they should have been present, or rather,
absent where we are encouraged to look for them. However, Africa was
not entirely absent from Picasso's "mental map" in the G&oacute;sol
period&#8212;it had just become confined to his artistic unconscious,
where it would re-emerge forcefully in <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>
(<a name="8" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#8"> 8</a>)
in ways that are still being contested.

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 466]</b>

<p>
African art objects are, of course, part of the thick description of
<i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> and also its enigma. According to
Malraux, Picasso was unwavering in his view that <i>Les Demoiselles
d'Avignon</i> came to him unconsciously during the visit to the Old
Trocad&eacute;ro and that it came to him not because of the enchantment
of the forms of the African art he encountered&#8212;he doesn't seem to
have paid much attention to these&#8212;but because what he recognized
in this art was a force, or spirit, that was hard to describe or
objectify. In other words, he was attracted by what he considered to
be the unconsciousness and inexpressible. The discovery of African art
was unique for Picasso because "for the first time the discovery of an
art was not the discovery of a style. African art was discovered, not
<i>an</i> African style" (<i>PM,</i> 171). In this context, the contrast
Picasso was to make between himself and Braque was revealing. For Picasso,
African objects were agents of exorcism (magical wards to be used against
the economy of symbolic form); for Braque, African art was valued because
of its form:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
That's also what separated me from Braque. He loved the Negro pieces,
but as I told you: because they were good sculptures. He was never at
all afraid of them. Exorcism didn't interest him. Because he wasn't
affected by what I called 'the whole of it,' or life, or&#8212;I don't
know&#8212;the earth?&#8212;everything that surrounds us, everything that
is not us&#8212;he didn't find all of that hostile. And imagine&#8212;not
even foreign to him! He was always at home . . . Even now . . . He
doesn't understand these things at all: he's not superstitious!
<p>
Then, there was another matter. Braque reflects when he works on his
paintings. Personally, when I want to prepare for a painting, I need
things, people. He's lucky: he never knew what curiosity was. People
stupidly mistake it for indiscretion. It's a disease. Also a passion,
because it has its advantages. He doesn't know a thing about life;
he never felt like doing everything with everything. [<i>PM,</i> 11,13]

<p>
Now, one of the reasons why reading Africanisms in Picasso has
continuously generated conflicts of interpretation is because many
attempts to read his "Negro Period"&#8212;and even cubist phase&#8212;as
both inside and outside European cultural history are imprisoned by
what Jameson has aptly called the ideology of modernism, which "imposes
its conceptual limitations on our aesthetic thinking and our taste and
judgment, and in its own way projects an utterly distorted model of
[literary or art] history."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
The struggle for a pure Picasso, one uncontaminated by Africa,
is ultimately a struggle to secure the aesthetic ideology of high
modernism, especially the privileging of form as the mark of its
breakthrough. It is not accidental, then, that many discussions of the
influence of African in the making of Picasso's major works tend to
revolve around the absence of a formal influence, or a style. And yet
in their concern with substantive formal influence, these discussions
start with a logic that is bound to fail because form is not what
Africa had given Picasso. Indeed, one could argue that what made the
African fetish attractive was that it would lead one away from forms
of representation modeled on observable experience or reality. After
all, as David Simpson has argued, what makes fetishism dangerous "in
all perception and representation" is that "reality itself is open
to construction."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
My contention is that it is precisely the doubleness of the
fetish&#8212;as a re that is located at the heart of culture and
ritual and yet seems to appear to us only in its perceptual nature,
against reality&#8212;that explains Picasso's enigmatic relationship

<b></b>

to the African res he discovered at the beginning of the twentieth
century. This doubleness is worth closer consideration because it haunts
some of the most influential attempts at both connecting Picasso to,
and disconnecting him from, the primitive.

<p>
In "Picasso," an essay written for the catalogue for MOMA's controversial
exhibition <i>Primitivism in 20th Century Art,</i> William Rubin
provided students of modern art with one of the most meticulous and
detailed examinations of Picasso's engagement with tribal arts and more
specifically African objects. Employing a combination of historical
documentation and a systematic comparison of some of Picasso's major
works and African art objects, Rubin establishes the centrality of the
artist's turn to primitivism and his empathy for the artworks of the
Other as one of the turning points in the emergence of modernism. He
shows, convincingly, that Picasso's turn to the primitive

<b></b>

had provided a way around artistic conventions that "had degenerated into
a rhetorical and sentimental art": "By embracing primitivism in 1906,
Picasso short-circuited the continuity of these inherited conventions,
and his year-long exploration of increasingly remote and alien aesthetic
correlatives permitted him to rediscover pictorial authenticity for
himself" ("PIC," 241). In Rubin's account, the discovery of the tribal was
an important bridge between the "soft modernism" that had characterized
Picasso's art before 1906 and the "hard modernism" of his cubist period.
<p>
But underneath his acknowledgement of the affinity between the tribal
and the modern, Rubin's project is also underwritten by a troubling
surreptitious intention: the need to minimize the role of the Other in the
emergence of modernism as a style and, in particular, the significance
of Africa as an artistic model, even when acknowledging their overall
affect. In other words, the majestic reconstructive effort in Rubin's
essay was driven by the desire to acknowledge the role of Africa as the
source of certain powerful unconscious forces while, at the same time,
minimizing the significance of the continent as the source of emulous
art forms, rather than simple spiritual objects. Thus in his reading of
Africanisms in <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,</i> Rubin sees the African
masks on the <i>demoiselles</i> as instruments for accentuating the
themes of sexuality and death rather than as models. His primary thesis
is that the invocation of African res and women (both subjects of
love and loathing in Picasso's psychic economy and behavior) enabled the
"cohabitation of Eros and Thanatos" ("PIC," 253). More specifically,
Rubin argues, the African faces would "finally conjure something that
transcends our sense of civilized experience, something ominous and
monstrous such as Conrad's Kurtz discovered in the heart of darkness"
("PIC," 254). Rubin acknowledged that Picasso's turn to the tribal was
prompted by the absence of a "Western precedent" for mask-like heads and
other forms of representing the human body in distortion, but he was
insistent that the precedence of primitivism lay not in the models it
provided but its psychological connotations; the word "African," for
example, evoked "something more fetishistic, magical, and above all,
potentially malefic" ("PIC," 259).
<p>
From this interpretation we can discern two immediate issues, which,
lie at the heart of the schemata of difference in modernism. The first
one is how the psychologizing of the relationship between the artist
and his primitive art forms depended on, or ended in, the sublimation of
the perceptual in the conceptual. Building on Picasso's own claim that
the tribal objects in his studio were "more witnesses than models,"
Rubin makes a crucial distinction between the kind of intertextuality
that characterized Picasso's relationship to the works of other European
artists such as C&eacute;zanne and tribal sculpture. In this scenario,
tribal sculpture could function as a point of departure for Picasso,
but its significance as an artistic source&#8212;a model&#8212;was
militated by the fact that Picasso "metamorphosized" his objects of
reference: "Picasso was impressed by aspects of its conceptual structure,
principles that he could abstract from their sources and use to his own
end" ("PIC," 260-2). It would appear that Rubin's goal here is to confer
the power of psychological affect on Africa while, at the same time,
denying it a formal influence in the making of modernism. But perhaps
more important is the distinction he draws between Picasso's intertextual
relation to tribal,

<b></b>

as opposed to, European art. Why is it that Picasso's intertextual
relation to Gauguin or C&eacute;zanne was considered constitutive (hence
conceptual) while his relationship to African objects was perceptual,
a mere starting point to something more profound than its degree zero?
<p>
We can clarify the issue at hand here by recalling that Picasso was one
of the most intertextual of modern artists. Indeed, the moments in his
career that have come to be considered epiphanic, such as the sojourn
to G&oacute;sol, are marked by powerful repaintings of the works of
other artists. It is in his distortion of the works of his precursors
that Picasso established his difference and thus his modernism. When
we consider Picasso's relation to, let's say Ingres or Goya during his
G&oacute;sol sojourn, Gauguin during the "Blue Period" or C&eacute;zanne
during the cubist phase, we are left in no doubt about the centrality of
intertextuality in his project. It can easily be said that his paintings
are, to borrow Jonathan Culler's words "intelligible only in terms of
a prior body of discourse&#8212;other projects and thoughts, which it
implicitly or explicitly takes up, prolongs, cites, refutes, transforms."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Nevertheless, in his study of the intertextual relation between the
European modern and the African or Oceanic primitive, Rubin's categorical
claim is that Picasso transformed the tribal masks in <i>Les Demoiselles
d'Avignon</i> so radically that nothing on the canvass resembled
"any African or Oceanic mask Picasso could have seen in Paris in
1907 in the studios of his friends or at the Trocad&egrave;ro museum"
("PIC," 262). What makes this claim puzzling, however, is that it is not
clear that a reading of Picasso's transformation of the masked res
from African or Oceanic traditions was radically different from the
transformation that the works of other European artists underwent in
his hands. Indeed, the transformation of res and forms so that they
could retain only a minimal relation to their artistic precursors was
one of the hallmarks of the method that we now call abstraction. And
as the structuralists used to argue in the 1960s and 1970s, one of the
signatures of a strong, as opposed to a weak, intertextuality was the
extent of the deviation from the original model. Strong intertextuality is
evident when the "borrowed" textual unit is "abstracted from its context
and inserted as if in a new textual syntagm as a paradigmatic element."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
A second problem in Rubin's psychological reading of Picasso's Africanism
is the emphasis he places on the subliminal and subconscious or
unconscious. It is, of course, true that in foregrounding the perceptual
dimension of the African connection, Rubin follows a long tradition (one
encouraged by Picasso himself) in which the encounter with the primitive
is defined by fear and repulsion and is hence connected to the forces that
modern civilization repressed. This is, of course, the familiar narrative
of primitivism in modernism. But to argue that the primitive art object
appealed to the modernists because of its association with repressed
psychological forces, and that those forces were the triggers for the
revolutionary works of modernism, should not necessarily lead to a de
facto negation of the more formal, conscious, conceptual influences
tribal art had on Picasso and his contemporaries. The problem with
Rubin's valorization of the psychological impact of the primitive on
Picasso's artistic consciousness is that it is built on the rather dubious
presupposition that subconscious or unconscious influences negate formal
ones; hence his expenditure of much energy trying to

<b></b>

show that the objects that were supposed to have influenced Picasso's
revision of <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>&#8212;Dan masks, for
example&#8212;were not accessible to the artist at a particular phase
in his career.
<p>
Rubin's theoretical stratagem&#8212;the claim that African art objects
had entered Picasso's subconscious but never rose to the level of
formal models&#8212;reflects, perhaps more boldly than that of others',
a significant feature of the conundrum of modernism in its relation
to the Others that it considered part of its schema. Simply put, if we
deny the Other as a model for new forms of art, how do we explain the
resemblances between Picasso and African masks that he was not supposed
to have seen? It is in response to this question that Rubin developed
his influential&#8212;and quite controversial&#8212;theory of affinities:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The resemblances between the heads in the <i>Demoiselles</i> and the
masks that have been compared to them in art-historical studies are
thus all fortuitous&#8212;reflections of affinities between arts that
communicate through conceptual signs, rather than through pictorial
conventions directly derived from seeing. Yet the fact that so many
more such affinities may be found between Picasso's art and that of
the tribal peoples than is the case with the work of other pioneer
modernists reflects, on Picasso's part, a profound identity of spirit
with the tribal peoples as well as a generalized assimilation of the
principles and character of their art. ["PIC," 265]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Rubin's argument depends on a fundamental distinction between
influence and affinity. In influence (Ingres, Gauguin, or C&eacute;zanne
on Picasso, for example) the relationship between the work of art and
its model takes place on the conceptual level in terms of observed formal
conventions. In affinity, the influence is perceptual, almost unconscious,
functioning on "an invented projection of an internal, psychological
state" (ibid). Rubin would simply not allow for "tribal" influences on
the formal, artistic level so central to the identity of modernism. It
was only through the unconscious that the Other would be allowed into a
now canonized modernism. An unconscious influence would not be allowed
to enter the surface where form is discernible. Thus, to describe or
posit an influence as unconscious is to simultaneously acknowledge its
constitutive presence in the making of the object under discussion but
also to deny it visibility. Apprehended in its absence and read solely
in terms of its perceptual, sensual influence, the African Other would
be contained and then evacuated from the edifice of high modernism.
<p>
But what are we to do with those instances where Picasso visibly modeled
his works on African objects and where the relationship between the two
was quite formal, as in the case of the <i>Guitar</i> and a Grebo mask
(. <a name="9" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#9">9</a> and
<a name="0" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#0">10</a>)? Rubin
documents many instances of what appear to be conceptual African
influences in Picasso's work, especially in 1907 and 1908, including
<i>Woman's Head</i> and a Fang sculpture (. <a name="1"
HREF="10.3gikandi_res.html#1">11</a> and <a name="2"
HREF="10.3gikandi_res.html#2">12</a>), but not even his own
evidence was enough to convince him that these works constituted
real models, sources of formal borrowings, rather than launching pads
towards a cubism detached from its influences. Clearly, Rubin was not
willing to concede African art forms the distinctive status of art;
they remained&#8212;had to remain&#8212;artifacts (ritual objects)
with the capacity for psychological influence, but not sources

<b></b>

of a formalized aesthetic. And in a curious way, this confinement of
African works of art to artifacts or ritual objects seems to ignore the
fact that in his own relationship with African objects, Picasso tended
to prefer those works which seemed to fit his <i>aesthetic</i> interests
and sensibilities rather than simple affect. Indeed, if Picasso seemed
to value African art objects over bodies, and quite often to privilege
the former over the latter, as I argued at the beginning of this essay,
it was because he was, in a very strict aesthetic sense, self-conscious
and selective about the objects he found worthy of incorporation in his
art. In short, Picasso had a clear idea about which objects, among his
vast African collection, could be considered worthy of formal emulation
and which could be consigned to the spectatorship of ritual.
<p>
It is now common to argue that Picasso was attracted to African art
because of its capacity to generate terror or that he sought those
subjects who would serve as what Bois calls "models for anatomical forms."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
And yet the Africanist elements in Picasso's paintings only appear
deforming to the extent that they call previous conventions of painting
into question, not merely because they duplicate the syphilitics that he
had encountered in French hospitals. In this sense it is striking that
while he had in front of him some of the most deformed and terrifying
res in the African pantheon, real fetishes as it were, Picasso
chose as models those masks that seemed to be closer to a familiar
European grammar about form and symmetry even when they challenged some
established notions of representation. Consequently, Picasso's version of
tribal art is one cleansed of the terror he seemed to have experienced
in his first encounter with it, streamlined in such a way that they are
no longer images of the deformity we are eager to ascribe to African
ritual objects. Once we recognize that Picasso modeled some of his works
on African objects but also departed from them significantly, once we
reject the model or no model option, we can shift the significance of
his relationship with Others elsewhere.

<p>
Now, one of the major criticisms leveled against the notion of affinity,
the reigning paradigm in the study of modernism and primitivism,
has centered on the implication that the tribal and the modern were
bound together by what James Clifford called "a deeper or more natural
relationship than mere resemblance or juxtaposition."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Clifford's major difficulty with affinity as "an allegory of kinship" is
that in its universalizing claims it excludes the stories and experiences
of the Others that modernism seeks to re-appropriate in its own image,
that scholars of modernism are primarily interested in tribal art for
its "informing principles" or its "elemental expressive modes."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
True enough. But it is important to underline the point that if
the proponents of affinity seem to have no difficulties mounting an
exhibition built on allegories of kinship, it is precisely because the
aesthetic ideology of modernism was itself driven by the same impulse,
the desire to encounter the Other in its ugliness and terror and then
purify it so that it could enter the modern art world as part of its
symmetrical economy. The major difference between modern artists and
their posthumous patrons is simply that the former were also interested
in "conceptual displacement" while the latter were

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 474]</b>

invested solely in "morphological coincidence."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
What makes Picasso such a central re in the history of modernism's
relationship to its Others was his ability to make the primitive central
to the aesthetic ideology of modern art while also transforming tribal
art objects in such a way that they were no longer recognizable as
models. This is how <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> has come to
be read, in Hal Forster's majestic phrase, as both the primal scene
of primitivism&#8212;" one in which its structure of narcissism and
aggressivity is revealed"&#8212;and also the site of disavowal of the
very difference it considers a condition of possibility.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
So, where exactly is Africa in Picasso's schemata? This question
returns us to the problem that opened my discussion, namely the strict
separation of African peoples and art objects in the artist's notion of
the primitive. However, a set of more complicated questions needs to be
posed: how could Picasso turn to Africa for its magic and art and yet
avoid being entangled in its endangered cultures or the problems of its
colonized peoples? How do we reconcile the terror and danger he felt when
he first encountered African objects at the ethnographic museum with the
symmetrical relationship he established between the tribal art work and
abstract modernism so that the two seem almost to have been made for one
another? The complaint that curators of modernism and primitivism seem
to avoid tribal artworks that seem impure and asymmetrical in relation to
the structures of Picasso's art is a familiar one, but I have been arguing
that the failure of such curatorial endeavors as the 1984 MOMA exhibition
does not simply arise from a yearning to rescue modern works from the
aesthetic influence of the primitive, or even from the institutional
necessity to wink at, yet displace, tribal works from their context. A
larger problem concerns the imprisonment of curators and historians
in the logic of coherence and symmetry favored by the practitioners of
modern art. In the end, this logic ignores two major problems which need
to be at the center of any discussion of the relationship between modern
painters and their African sources, especially when we are discussing
those crucial years between 1895 and 1922 when modernism emerged: the
question of African definition and authority of sources.
<p>
The question of definition was raised most poignantly by Robert Farris
Thompson in 1988: "what are the indigenous <i>African</i> definitions of
the impact of African art forms on the artists of the cities of Europe
(like Fang masks in Paris) at the beginning of this century?"
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Berating the arrogance of Western art historians who never once consider
that "the African priests and traditional leaders might have something of
intellectual substance to contribute to this most important argument,"
Thompson concludes that "the final definition of the impact of African
and Oceania upon modern art remains incomplete until we take large
photographs of the Africanizing works of Picasso, Braque, <i>et al</i>
to traditional Africa . . . and listen to indigenous comments and
critical reaction."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
We still do not have "indigenous" commentaries on works of modernism. In
the few instances where indigenous artists have been given access to
the institutions of commentary, they have been denied the authority
of criticism.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Even the works of African art historians produced in the most prestigious
institutions in the West, are not heard across the temporal and
cartographic divide that separates the study of expressive and other
cultural forms between the modern and everything before or after it.

<b></b>

<p>
But what lessons could we learn from African art historians that would
be useful to modernism, to the relation between Picasso and Africa? For
one, we could learn that Picasso has had a significant, though perhaps
surreptitious, influence on the field of African art studies. Otherwise
how can one explain the almost unquestioning assumption that the mask is
the primary medium of traditional African visual expression? On the other
side of the debate, however, a shift in contexts of reading&#8212;from
seeing Africa from Picasso's perspective to seeing the modern artist's
from the Other's angle of vision &#8212;can yield even more useful
results. Consider the fact that in a large measure, the literature on
Picasso and his African sources assumes that the mask in Africa was
part of a unified and intelligible tradition and that its value lay
in its ritualized form and function. Yet, the most detailed studies of
African masks, their cultural contexts, and the views of their producers,
recognize the intersection between the ritual fields in which they are
produced (and out of which they perhaps cannot be understood) and the
centrality of the meaning of the mask in motion.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Indeed, contemporary African writers and artists who have deployed the
mask in their works recognize the significance of movement in determining
the form of the mask and its interpretation.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
A final enigma must be confronted if we are to rethink the role of the
Other in the making of modern art outside the ideology of modernism: how
do we transcend the established doxa that it was through the acquisition
of the "mythical method" or "mystical mentality" inherent in primitivism
that, to paraphrase T. S. Eliot, art was made possible for the modern
world?
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
What is the source of this idea, the unquestioned notion that the art of
the primitive emerged from a mystical, preconscious mentality and found
its ideal form in myth? Why, indeed, did the idea of the African fetish
dominate Picasso's understanding of the African primitive in that initial
encounter at the Trocad&eacute;ro in 1906? We are, of course, familiar
with the ethnographers of the primitive mentality and the mythical
method, most notably Levi-Bruhl and Sir William Fraser, and countless
studies have been devoted to the influence of their ethnography on the
ideology of modernism; but we have not often paid enough attention to
the ethnographers' sources. As a matter of fact, we seem to take it
for granted that the ethnographers of modernism conducted field work
among the primitives and that their powerful ideas on the cultures and
myths of the other came from native sources. The real story, however, is
different. The primary sources behind the idea of the African primitive
were not the academic ethnographers but a group of what I will call
the surrogate native informants: European adventurers such as Leo
Frobenius, Emily Torday, and Mary Kingsley; missionary ethnographers
such as Robert Nassau, John Roscoe, and G. T. Basden; and colonial
administrative officers such as R. S. Rattray in Ashanti and Amaury
Talbot in South Eastern Nigeria. These were the first Europeans to
write about African cultures and to make art central to understanding
the primitive mentality. They also produced their most important work
in the foundational years of modernism.
<p>
Briefly, there are three reasons why these surrogate informants
are central to any rethinking of modernism and its ideas of the
primitive. First, while academic ethnographers were generally critical of
the colonial enterprise, most often its methods rather than objectives,
the surrogate informants conceived their work in the field as crucial to

<b></b>

colonial governmentality and as a practical contribution to the
theoretical work of the intellectuals of modernism. They assumed that the
work of ethnographers at major European universities needed the authority
of observations made first hand in the theater of colonialism. Indeed,
surrogate informants cultivated close relations with the leading
ethnographers of primitive cultures. Thus, John Roscoe, who wrote the
first ethnography of the Baganda, was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Fraser
at Cambridge, and Rattray who wrote on the Ashanti, was a collaborator
of E. G. Selignman at Oxford. As agents in the field of colonialism,
the informants premised their authority on their contact with those
Africans who, in Roscoe's words, were "uninfluenced by foreign ideas."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Second, the surrogate informants were the first, in those crucial years
between 1905 and 1922, to promulgate the notion that the mentality of the
primitive was mystical and mythical, outside modern forms of rationality,
and under the hold of fetishism. One could not understand the native
mind or indeed any aspect of native religion and social organization
without understanding the role of the fetish, the explanatory code that
connected everything. Third, as is evident from the sheer amount of
cross-reference, the surrogate informants existed in a cohesive field
of discourse, and thus reinforced the idea of a core set of beliefs
that were uniform across Africa.
<p>
As part of a generational project, adventurers, colonial officers, and
missionaries referred to each others' work and used the parallels they
saw in their respective fields of operation to reinforce the power of
their ideas, to provide the thick description that made their evidence
unassailable. This is why even when artists such as Picasso questioned
colonial practices, they seemed to reproduce the colonialist model
of African societies; they questioned the practice but not the theory
of colonialism. This structure&#8212;the questioning of the practice
and the acceptance of the theory&#8212;tends to be reproduced when we
don't interrogate the idea of Africa in modern art, when, for example,
we forget the brutality that accompanied the arrival of the African art
object to the West, the amount of African bodies that had to be destroyed
so that the objects would arrive safely at the art museum
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Finally, three challenges remain to be addressed in greater detail. The
first one is how to restore the intimate relationship between the
brutality of late colonialism and the emergence of the ideology of
modernism and, the second, to consider more closely the role the surrogate
informants played in making Africa accessible to modernism. The third
one is how to displace Picasso&#8212;as the representative custodian of
high modernism in art&#8212;from the ritualized place that he occupies
in the modern museum.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
It is my contention that we cannot undertake the work
of displacement and de-ritualization without changing the
language of commentary, the allegory of affinity, the contexts
for reading and&#8212;eventually&#8212;our understanding of
perspective and spectatorship. What were to happen, for example,
if one were to exhibit <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> next to
Faith Ringgold's quilt, <i>Picasso's Studio</i> (<a name="3"
href="10.3gikandi_res.html#3"> 13</a>), instead of
traditional Pende Mbuya masks? Or if we examined <i>Woman's Head</i> not
in relation to an indigenous Fang mask but next to <i>Mina ya Nnom</i>
(<a name="4" href="10.3gikandi_res.html#4"> 14</a>),
a bronze sculpture by Leandro Mbomio Nsue, the contemporary Equatorial
Guinean artist, a modern representation of the Fang perspective on form?

My assumption here is that while the literature on black bodies
and modernism has grown in recent years, as has that on race and
modernism, most of it takes the African American, not the African, to
be the representative black subject. See, for example, Michael North,
<i>The Dialectic of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth Century
Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994) and the essays
collected in <i>Race and the Modern Artist,</i> ed. Heather Hathaway,
Josef JaYab, and Jeffrey Melnick (New York: Oxford University Press,
2003).

I pursue these questions in greater detail in <i>Unmodern Subjects:
Race, Art, and African Difference</i> from which this discussion is
excerpted. Discussing the way the "ghostly" makes its way into the
movement of European history, Jacques Derrida observes that "Haunting
would mark the very existence of Europe. It would open the space and
the relation to self of what is called by this name, at least since the
Middle Ages. See Jacques Derrida, <i>Specters of Marx: The State of Debt,
the Work of Mourning, and the New International,</i> trans. Peggy Kamuf
(New York: Routledge, 1994), 4.

After eighty sittings, Picasso gave up "seeing" Gertrude Stein and turned
to the mask as an alternative way of viewing. The significance of this
turn from the human model to the mask is discussed by Michael North in
<i>The Dialectic of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth Century
Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 59-76. For a
feminist reading of the <i>Portrait of Gertrude Stein</i>, see Tamar Darb,

and Pablo," in <i>Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,</i> ed. Christopher
Green (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 55-76.

But in discussing notions of disorder, we need to keep Mary Douglas's
dictum in mind: "Reflections on dirt involves reflection on the relation
of order to disorder, being to non-being, form to formlessness, life to
death." <i>See Purity and Danger,</i> 6.

This is not to deny Picasso's interested radical anti-colonial politics;
merely to raise the possibility that radical anti-colonialism might have
needed the valorization of the primitive as part of its maintenance, a
point that was to become more apparent with the rise of surrealism. For
Picasso and French colonialism in Africa, see "Colonialism, <i>l'art
n&eacute;gre</i> and <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>," in <i>Picasso's
Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i>, 77-103.

The most notorious instance of this exclusion concerns the Baule artist,
Lela Kouakou, who was invited to participate in a forum on African art
but was allowed to comment only on works from his ethnic region because
he was deemed incapable of providing "objective" aesthetic judgments,
that is, those not bound by his "traditional criteria." See Susan Vogel,
"Introduction" to <i>Perspectives: Angles on African Art,</i> 11. For
a subtle discussion of this criterion of inclusion and exclusion see

of Culture</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), 137-9.

What, for example, is the structural relationship between the destruction
of the Kingdom of Benin by a British Expeditionary Force in 1897 and
the availability of Benin sculpture to the British Museum? Should it
surprise us that the rooted sculpture is now housed in a modern wing
of the British Museum, paid for by a family that made its fortunes in
the confectionaries of empire, and named after Henry Moore, a leading
modernist and connoisseur of African art? For the Benin Expedition,

and Popular Imagination</i> (New Haven, Conn. : Yale University Press,

I had suggested a similar act of deritualization, albeit too briefly,
for T. S. Eliot in <i>Maps of Englishness: Writing Identity in the
Culture of Colonialism</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996),
