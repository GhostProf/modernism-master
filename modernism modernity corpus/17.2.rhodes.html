<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>
	  “Forms of Havoc: The Malatesta Cantos and The Battler” demonstrates Ezra Pound’s exploration of boxing as an aesthetic practice through the use of boxing terminology and images in The Malatesta Cantos , reframing the text as a meditation on the constituent properties of aestheticized violence, and suggesting boxing’s impact on the formal features of the text itself. The article recovers Pound’s circulation in Parisian boxing subculture during the early 1920’s, and argues that the hectic style of boxing Pound practiced, known as battling, provided a contemporary vocabulary to make legible Malatesta’s life as a <span style="font-style:italic;">condotierro</span>, as well as the conceptual terminology for aesthetic violence in The Malatesta Cantos.

<p>
	  In his 1967 memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blasting and Bombardiering</span>, Wyndham Lewis offers a rare glimpse into the boxing of Ezra Pound and Ernest Hemingway:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Having found [Pound’s] abode, I rang the bell. A great deal of noise was to be heard but no one answered: therefore I pushed open the door, which opened practically into the studio. A splendidly built young man, stripped to the waist, and with a torso of dazzling white, was standing not far from me. He was tall, handsome, and serene, and was repelling with his boxing gloves a hectic assault of Ezra’s. After a final swing at the solar plexus Pound fell back upon his settee. That man was Hemingway.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  At first blush, Lewis’s anecdote seems to confirm many of the qualities associated with Pound and Hemingway as writers and literary res: Hemingway as uber-masculine and highly disciplined, Pound as comfortably frenetic, on the razor’s edge between collapse and creation. As this essay will make clear, a more acute synthesis of boxing and aesthetics can be seen in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the text Pound was drafting at the time of Lewis’s visit: the Malatesta Cantos. Lewis’s account, however, offers only a partial reconstruction of what these sparring sessions might have been like, and Hemingway’s description in a 1922 letter to Sherwood Anderson paints a fuller portrait:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    I’ve been teaching Pound to box wit [sic] little success. He habitually leads wit his chin and has the general grace of the crayfish or crawfish. He’s willing but short winded. Going over there this afternoon for another session but there aint much job in it as I have to shadow box between rounds to get up a sweat.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Three weeks later, Hemingway wrote to Howell Jenkins,
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    I’m boxing regular with Ezra Pound, and he has developed a terrific wallop. I can usually cross myself though before he lands them and when he gets too tough I dump him on the floor. He is a good game guy and has come along to beat hell wit [sic] the gloves—someday I will get careless and he will knock me for a row of latrines.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Hemingway echoes Lewis’s impression of his own athletic superiority and Pound’s lack of stamina. He also diagnoses Pound’s lack of technique in leading “wit his chin,” that is, attacking with his head out in front of his body rather than squarely balanced over his feet in a way that corroborates Pound’s self-inflicted fall. In another letter Hemingway suggested that the pedagogy was reciprocal, “I’m teaching Pound how to box and he’s helping me with my writing.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> What Lewis experiences as a display of crude will against athletic prowess, Hemingway glosses as an act of instruction corollary to Pound’s aesthetic tutelage.
	</p>
<p>
	  Critics have been keen to sketch the parameters of the Pound/Hemingway friendship, often stressing the influence Pound had on Hemingway’s early writing, both materially, as the animating force behind Hemingway’s publishing connections in Paris, London, and New York, and artistically, as someone who encouraged particular aesthetic values in Hemingway.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Hemingway’s debt to imagism—his use of concrete language, rigorous precision, and stress on the reservoirs of significance in the objective world—are often attributed to his relationship with Pound, though critics debate whether Pound’s ideas about literature provided a program for the young Hemingway to model, or strengthened lines of aesthetic development that Hemingway was already pursuing.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Hemingway’s letter frames boxing and writing as reciprocal practices, the other half of the literary pedagogy we commonly take to be so integral to their relationship.
	</p>
<p>
	  Yet an interest in the Pound/Hemingway literary friendship has failed to account for its sustained interest in boxing. Noted by biographers but unregarded as a point of critical interest, Pound’s journey through Paris’s boxing subculture from 1920 to 1924 involved more than sparring sessions with Hemingway; he also frequented bouts at stadiums such as the Velodrome d’Hiver and the Cirque du Paris. Yet boxing is not merely a biographical curiosity, but also a neglected constituent of Pound’s literary aesthetic, particularly in the fruitfully troubled confluence of aesthetics and antagonism.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Pound’s early correspondence from his years in London often employs a slugging  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> persona, full of knockouts and bravado, as a way of ring literary debate. In a 1912 letter to Harriet Monroe, Pound insists, “It’s only when a few men who know, get together and <span style="font-style:italic;">disagree</span> that any sort of criticism is born . . . I’ve got a right to be severe. For one man I strike there are ten to strike back at me. I stand exposed. It hits me in my dinner invitations, in my weekends, in reviews of my own work. Nevertheless it’s a good t.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Battling against a literary orthodoxy, the idea of a fistt is a metaphor for struggling against “people who don’t care for the master-work . . . who make no effort toward the best, who are content with publicity and the praise of reviewers.” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 46). Pound’s sense of valuing a “good t” in literary circles is also expressed in a 1909 letter to William Carlos Williams:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    If you have saved any pennies during your stay in Nueva York, you’d better come across and broaden your mind. American doctors are in great demand in Italy, especially during the touring season. Besides, you’d much prefer to <span style="font-style:italic;">scrap</span> with an intelligent person like myself than with a board of directing idiots (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 41; my emphasis).
	  </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  In 1917 Pound would offer his head to Williams as a speed bag during an epistolary argument, “Or will you carry my head on a platter? Or would you like it brought over to be punched??” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 181). Later, in a 1928 letter to James Vogel, Pound continues to re literary debate in boxing terms, writing that, “The ones with nothing to say get scared, are afraid to recognize the qualities of others for fear there won’t be a place on the bandwagon for themselves, etc. NO GOOD WORK EVER KNOCKED OUT ANY OTHER GOOD WORK” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 221).
	</p>
<p>
	  Shot through with a related kind of aestheticized antagonism, the Malatesta Cantos are intricately webbed in this nexus of boxing and literary friendship. Like Hemingway’s <span style="font-style:italic;">in our time</span>, Henry Strater’s illustrations inform the deluxe edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Draft of XVI Cantos</span>, in which the Malatesta Cantos first appeared in book form. Hemingway himself might be said to be equally important to the Malatesta Cantos in a less apparent way. In 1923 Hemingway accompanied Pound on a walking tour of southern France and Italy which composed part of his research efforts from May 1922 to April 1923 for this section of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>, offering Pound logistical help with many of the battles incorporated into the Malatesta Cantos.
	</p>
<p>
	  Critics have drawn due attention to the Tempio Malatestiano, the sepulcher built by Malatesta which contains the remains of Isotta degli Atti, his mistress and later third wife, as a model for, or expression of, the artistic vision of the Malatesta Cantos. Lawrence Rainey’s authoritative study of the Malatesta Cantos, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ezra Pound and the Monument of Culture</span>, confirms in its title a preference for the Tempio Malatestiano as an aesthetic ideal “which shaped [Pound’s] thinking at the outset of his work in 1922 and, indeed, for the rest of his life.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Through meticulous historical research, Rainey crystallizes a long-established strain of thinking about the Tempio’s importance for the Malatesta Cantos. In an early appraisal, Thomas Jackson suggests that “the image of successful direction voluntatis is the Temple, not Malatesta’s entire personality.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> As Christine Brooke-Rose puts it, “What [Pound] is really interested in is the building of the Temple, Sigismondo’s tribute to Isotta and the manifestation of his wholeness as a man,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as a patron of the arts and a true representative of the Renaissance.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Michael André Bernstein makes a more explicit comparison when he suggests, “Just as Sigismondo Malatesta constructs his Tempio out of whatever material is at hand and whatever artists he can employ, so Pound builds his presentation not just of Sigismondo himself, but of the entire era, out of a series of brief, memorable incidents.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The Tempio’s palimpsest of Renaissance architecture over an existing gothic church, it’s blending of pagan and sacred iconography, its sheer heterogeneity and permanence, it is argued, all lend themselves to the formal features of Pound’s sprawling epic.
	</p>
<p>
	  Without taking away from the importance of the Tempio as a cultural product that Pound thinks seriously about, I wish to point out what is perhaps all too obvious about the Malatesta Cantos. That is, their preoccupation with the often violent process surrounding the Tempio’s production, indeed, with the very battles that Hemingway was logistically ring for Pound in 1923. Throughout Cantos VIII–XI, Malatesta ts—“And he fought in Fano,” “And he fought like ten devils at Monteluro,” “And we beat the papishes and fought/ them back through the tents,” “And he came up to the dyke-gate/ And fought through the dyke-gate”—as a contracted, professional warrior whose great aesthetic work is produced in, and often because of, a swirl of incessant violence.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> In focusing on the formal properties of the Tempio, we miss the ways in which the Malatesta sequence puts these acts of violence and warfare at the core of Malatesta’s enduring cultural relevance.
	</p>
<p>
	  If a focus on the Tempio overlooks the Malatesta Cantos’ insistence on the historical record of Malatesta’s ting, its consequences are twofold. First, it has occluded the ways in which the Malatesta Cantos are an explicit meditation on the efficacy of violence in cultural production. Second, the legacy of Malatesta’s battles is doubly important for the ways that the working through of this idea involves the informing aesthetic of modern boxing. Kasia Boddy and David Scott have both recently suggested, though in very different ways, that boxing in the early twentieth century is a mass cultural sport with aesthetic valences, and the Malatesta Cantos belong very much in any conversation about the aesthetic potential of boxing or modern sport more generally.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  That said, the mass appeal associated with boxing was the furthest thing from Pound’s aim with the Malatesta Cantos. Pound followed the completion of the Malatesta sequence in 1923 with a letter to Kate Buss, in which he describes their publication in “a dee looks edtn of my Cantos (about 16 of ‘em, I think) of UNRIVALLED magnificence. Price 25 dollars per copy, and 50 and 100 bones for Vellum and illuminateds . . . Not for the Vulgus” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LEP</span>, 187). Still, the Malatesta Cantos are an important stitch historically in Pound’s triangulated relationship with Hemingway and boxing during these years, and as will become clear shortly, Pound’s first extended meditation on the constituent properties of artistic and cultural production. In this essay I will recover the deep situation of the Malatesta Cantos in boxing discourse through their appropriation of the re of the battler: an untrained, exceedingly rough type of ter who articulated concerns in contemporaneous boxing discourse regarding the possibilities of recklessness and violence being undergirded by technical maxims. I will show how the formal developments most associated with the Malatesta Cantos internalize and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> project the imperatives of battling, and argue that a battling aesthetic pivots the notions of technique and form—so central to the aesthetic importance of the Malatesta Cantos, and whatever we may term the shared aesthetic of Pound and Hemingway—toward their formulation at sites of popular culture.
	</p>
<p>
	  Because few would argue with the importance of the Malatesta Cantos for both the fate of the Cantos as a whole and for the formal possibilities of modernist poetry, its relationship to boxing is a question of particular importance for modernist studies more generally. As Myles Slatin insightfully put it some time ago, “the design of [The Cantos] suddenly crystallized . . . as a result of the long and intensive labor which went into the Malatesta group.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Critics who differ on the salient implications of the Malatesta Cantos, for instance Lawrence Rainey, Marjorie Perloff, Richard Sieburth, and Michael André Bernstein, all agree on the transformative nature of the Malatesta Cantos for poetic form. Cantos VIII–XI mark Pound’s use of collage—the wholesale incorporation of blocks of quoted text—and his challenge to cherished distinctions between prose and poetry, poetry and history, high art and everyday culture.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> To revisit the Malatesta Cantos through the lens of modern boxing is to recognize the text’s assertion of the contingency of cultural production on a particular kind of violence, but simultaneously on a mass cultural discourse with a similar vocabulary for formal and technical violence. In this way, I will open up avenues for talking about modernist aesthetics in a way that depends on the dialectical relationship between modernist literature and popular culture, and which reconsiders the perceived antipathy of the Malatesta Cantos to mass cultural forms. The Malatesta Cantos demonstrate not only a delight in boxing, but a recognition of the aesthetic affinities between boxing and the innovations of modernist literary practice.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II</h1>
<p>
	  Rather than school Pound in the kind of scientific boxing which he knew well, Hemingway’s letters suggest that he encouraged Pound to box wildly, “to beat hell wit the gloves.” What Pound cultivated during those sessions was not the calculated precision of technical strategy, but a “terrific wallop,” and the capacity to “knock [one] for a row of latrines.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> While Lewis undoubtedly focuses more on Hemingway in his description of Pound and Hemingway sparring, the kind of ter embodied by Pound—rough, unskilled, excessively violent—was actually more integral for Pound’s literary production. In the early decades of the twentieth century, this description could have applied to any number of professional ters—Ad Wolgast, Battling Siki, Luis Ángel Firpo, Jack Dempsey, Oscar “Battling” Nelson, Jess Willard—all of whom were understood to be the kind of ter known as a “battler.” Hemingway’s most extended meditation on this re is the 1925 short story, “The Battler”; since the Malatesta Cantos lack such an eponymous connection, some identification of the key issues and ideas drawn together by the battler in boxing discourse will be necessary to secure their own link. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> magazine, the battler is a ter who “absolutely lacks science, makes no pretense at skillful boxing, but who depends wholly upon his terrific punching  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> powers to bring an opponent into submission.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> As ters of mesmerizing brutality and punching power, battlers were thought to be excessively violent and devoid of the ring tactics used by more cagey boxers. Their lack of “scientific” skill amounted to a form of savagery, and were often animalized or referred to as “cave-men” or “primitives.” For example, Jack London, who wrote boxing reportage for <span style="font-style:italic;">The San Francisco Examiner</span> from 1901–1910, said of heavyweight Jim Jeffries before his 1910 title t with Jack Johnson (which Johnson won) that, “Old mother nature in him is still red of fang and claw. He is more a Germanic tribesman and warrior of two thousand years ago than a civilized man of the twentieth century.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> first appeared on newsstands in 1922—the <span style="font-style:italic;">annus mirabilis</span> of modernism—and was the first transatlantic periodical dedicated to boxing. Intended to extricate boxiana from the salacious pages of publications such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Police Gazette</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Boxing</span>, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Clipper</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> soon became boxing’s most important source of expert commentary and exchange about the emerging technical points of the sport. While <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> made available for public consumption stores of oral knowledge passed down in gyms, backrooms, and training camps, it also red that technical knowledge explicitly as boxing’s calling card in circuits of middle-class respectability: “Take for example,” <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> asked in 1928, “the great ts between Joe Walcott and Kid Lavigne, Joe Gans and Battling Nelson, Ad Wolgast and Battling Nelson [all noted battlers] and a horde of others. There will never be such combats as these under our present system of boxing rules and training. If gladiators were to present the condition in which Walcott and Lavigne found themselves, modern rules would probably call a halt by the referee.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  More importantly, the terms in which this appeal was made—decency established through new techniques and rules—successfully inscribed a particular conception of boxing that marginalized prizeters who relied instead on brute physicality and toughness instead of well-honed skills. In June 1922, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span> published “Modern Pugilists Divided into Three Types,” an article in which it divided modern boxers into: “1: Light hitters, but clever boxers. 2: Fairly good boxers, but knockout hitters. 3: Sluggers without boxing skill—the equivalent of a bruiser type of ter.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The “slugger” type would have been synonymous with “battler,” and in fact recalled a cluster of similar epithets—mauler, bruiser, killer, etc. I use the term battler because the word evokes a sense of giving and receiving punishment, but also because it was the single term conjugated into a gerund and used as a moniker for certain ters: Battling Nelson, Battling Levinsky, Battling Siki, among others. Of all the possible names for this particular type of ter, the battler is the one most closely associated by virtue of grammatical flexibility with the conflation of praxis and character which allowed battlers, both black and white, to be labeled “savage” or “primitive.”
	</p>
<p>
	  The battler came to compartmentalize the more “primitive” aspects of boxing—its brutality, instinct, and carnality—during a period in which those qualities were quickly being downplayed. Insofar as there was a logic to battling, the battler was thought to work by instinct, ting without intellection or strategy. Battling Siki, for example, explained his victory over Georges Carpentier thusly, “When I got into the ring I shut  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> both my eyes and swung. I knocked my opponent out. How I did it I do not know.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> That Siki’s answer undercuts the premise of the question (how does one, after all, knock an opponent out without swinging?) suggests a tacit critique of the need for an explanation in the first place. Similarly, in a 1924 interview with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ring</span>, Jack Dempsey rejected technical explanations for his own success, “I’ve never tried to be clever . . . I have only one thought in my head as I sit in the corner waiting for the t to start: ‘Where am I going to hit him? . . . t in the ring just as you would t on the street. If you’re in a street t you don’t stop to feint and to be clever—you hit! I know only one kind of footwork—the kind that brings me in close enough to sock.’”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  While the battler represented a form of ting at odds with orthodox boxing, the efficacy of battling attracted considerable attention and respect. As one reporter claimed, “Speed, cleverness and strategy are all subordinate to the wallop.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Commentators often foregrounded the battler’s ability to expose the fallacy of conflating sophistication with success, such as when covering Luis Firpo, an Argentinean boxer who briefly contended for the world heavyweight championship: “Firpo reminds the writer of the raw Jim Jeffries he encountered at Corbett’s camp, the Jeffries who bored such a wise handler of boxers as Billy Delaney because he was so ‘awkward’ and knew ‘so little’ about the game.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Ford Madox Ford, with a similar kind of ironic distance, spoke to this idea as well through a fictionalized narrator in <span style="font-style:italic;">Provence: From Minstrels to the Machine</span>:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    A boxer’s brain should be completely empty of every thought—of every desire even, except that for slaughter. Thought is heavy; it adds to the fatigue of combat; thought is relaxing, it slows down the speed of blows; thought softens, it leads you to think that you have punished your adversary sufficiently . . . That is true. As a former judge at I do not know how many Army boxing contests I confirm every word of it.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  This interest in complicating assumptions about the processes and mechanics of battling—for in Ford’s novel the move to extinguish thought is a form of willed ratiocination—reflected a similar desire among boxing’s cognoscenti. Trainers and ters began diagramming technical explanations of particularly powerful, “savage” punches, such as the “Rabbit Punch,” or the “Sling Shot.” Advertisements soon appeared in boxing magazines promising “Knockout Punches of Champions, explained by Jimmy DeForest, World-Famous trainer and boxing instructor.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Since battling embodied an unorthodoxy of technique that was so effective, a formal logic was often mapped onto battlers’ seeming randomness of style; boxing experts became ciphers for the battler’s illegible axioms of skill and technique.
	</p>
<p>
	  Thus a tension emerges in the re of the battler regarding the seemingly disjunct concepts of form and recklessness. On the one hand, the battler functions as a kind of proximal antithesis to the discourses of scientific boxing, encapsulating all the particularly violent or reckless facets of the sport that “scientific boxing” excluded. On the other, the battler was also very much a re probed by questions of technique and form invited by the efficacy of precisely this perceived recklessness or instinct. In this way, the battler might be said to displace and locate anxieties about the violence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of boxing onto particular ters (or, more accurately, a particular style which ters could embody), but also to raise a related proposition about the possibilities of giving logic to the seemingly illogical, of formalizing a style of ting which at first glance seems to utterly resist any kind of formal scheme. As a ter who made little sense within the highly methodical style of scientific boxing, the battler offered the possibility for formal and technical sense-making to be consistent with, and not anathema to, excessive and unremitting violence. In this way, the battler tests the limits of modern boxing’s commitment to the discourses of form and technique because it understands those qualities to be operative at its most extreme margins. Yet it would also offer a model for modernist literary practice regarding the possibilities of a formalized recklessness.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">III</h1>
<p>
	  Born into the ruling family of Rimini in 1418, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta’s life reads like a rap sheet of genealogical and personal violence. Commentators both in Malatesta’s time and after have been quick to emphasize the centrality of violence and depravity to Malatesta’s life and legacy, and indeed even the briefest account of Malatesta’s life finds these characteristics inescapable.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> In the midst of this perpetual ting, Malatesta commissioned the construction of the Tempio. As Rainey notes, romantic interpretations of the Tempio prevalent in the nineteenth century, which Pound both mimicked and fundamentally rebuked in the Malatesta Cantos, often framed its construction as a testament to dual depravities: on the one hand, Malatesta’s love for his mistress-then-wife, Ixotta, and on the other, paganism over Church beliefs.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The Tempio has stood as a testament to these two forms of illegitimacy at various points in history, but the Tempio is of particular importance in the Malatesta Cantos for its position within the historical legacies of rape, pillage, and murder which accounted for its construction. For instance, in Canto IX, Pound excerpts from a letter “found in the post-bag” of Malatesta, addressed to Leon Battista Alberti, the Tempio’s chief architect, for:

	The exactitude of these orders makes them an awkward fit within the harried and often improvised scheme of Malatesta’s personal history evidenced elsewhere in the Malatesta Cantos: hiding neck deep in marsh water at the opening of Canto IX, caught “like a hen in a coop” in Ancona, and wriggling between the shifting alliances of Italian city states. Their made-to-order precision is, moreover, out of step with either the poetic form of the Malatesta Cantos or the post-bag which serves as its <span style="font-style:italic;">mise en abyme</span> in Canto IX,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as a collection of cobbled fragments. Thus the Tempio stands in unnatural relationship to the historical circumstances of its production: part of the violent and unpredictable Malatestan chronicle, yet also exceptional due to its precision and permanence. As Reed Dasenbrock puts it, “what [Pound] wanted Malatesta to show is precisely the tension or ambivalence between creativity and violence.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Yet to see nothing ambivalent or tense about the connection between creativity and violence is to see Malatesta as a kind of Renaissance battler: stigmatized as the embodiment of unrestrained vice, outside the accepted and acceptable narratives of Renaissance humanism, and seemingly bereft of method or scheme in his rape, plunder, and killing, in other words, analogous to boxing’s own threat to its social and legal legitimation narrative by being crude, violent, and exceedingly reckless. Malatesta’s violent and disreputable acts received extended attention in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries</span> of Pius II, the most enduring Renaissance record of Malatesta’s life, and persisted as the core element of his reputation up to the time Pound began writing the Malatesta Cantos. Jakob Burkhardt, in his exemplary <span style="font-style:italic;">The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy</span> , dismisses Malatesta with a single line, remarking on his “disinterested love of evil.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> One of the more damning passages from Pius II’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries</span>, often quoted in discussions of the Malatesta Cantos, is worth reproducing at some length for the specific character of its attack:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  He was such a slave to avarice that he was ready not only to plunder but to steal. His lust was so unbridled that he violated his daughters and his sons-in-law. When he was a lad he often played the bride and after taking the woman’s part debauched men. No marriage was sacred to him. He ravished nuns and out-raged Jewesses; boys and girls who would not submit to him he had murdered or savagely beaten. He committed adultery with many women to whose children he had been godfather and murdered their husbands. He outdid all barbarians in cruelty. His bloody hand inflicted terrible punishments on innocent and guilty alike. He oppressed the poor, plundered the rich, spared neither widows nor orphans. No one felt safe under his rule.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	As Michael F. Harper has observed, Pound’s perceived omission of this legacy had led to the dismissal for many years of the Malatesta Cantos as poor historicism, the willfully rosy portrait of a depraved power-glutton.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>
	It is indeed a peculiar appraisal of the Malatesta Cantos, particularly as Canto X neither omits this legacy nor downplays it, but rather reproduces exactly the crucial charges of this passage from the original Latin.

<p class="continued">
	  Following the authority of Giovanni Soranzo, a contemporaneous Malatesta scholar whose work did much to challenge Romantic interpretations of the Tempio, Pound suggests that Andrea del Benzi’s 1461 speech to the consistatory of Cardinals was in fact written by Pius II, and that the charges are trumped up and false. A cursory comparison between the two invectives corroborates more detailed historical scholarship that substantiates Pound’s claim: both emphasize murder, lechery, incest, and rape.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Pound’s suspicion of Benzi and Pius’s collusion isn’t identical to a rebuke of the charges, however. Rather than shying away from Malatesta’s identification with unheeded violence and lust, the Malatesta Cantos imagine them as crucial to, and at times constituting his contributions to Western culture. The presentation of these charges in Canto X is particularly significant, as it foregrounds the terms in which violence and degradation become cultural catalysts. Of the fourteen Latin epithets used to denigrate Malatesta, the middle term numerically and visually is <span style="font-style:italic;">audax</span>, “reckless one.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Audax</span> is not only the term at the numerical and visual center of the passage, but also of Malatesta himself, indicating a more abstracted idea of character than the rest of the epithets which all tie specifically to a particular act—rape, patricide, perjury, murder, etc. The passage thus confronts head-on the principal charges against Malatesta, but also identifies a core quality that organizes them into something more than a laundry list of depravity; <span style="font-style:italic;">audax</span>, in other words, proposes a rubric under which Malatesta’s personal atrocities both retain their undertones of unrepentant hedonism, and also fall under a more commodious concept of recklessness which opens a space for talking about such qualities as positive or progressive forces. For instance, after concluding the treatment of Malatesta’s indictment before the consistatory of cardinals and subsequent <span style="font-style:italic;">auto-da-fé</span>, complete with Pius’s praise of Benzi’s speech and burning ef, Pound quotes Borso d’Este as saying “the time was ill-suited / to <span style="font-style:italic;">tanta novita</span>, such doings or innovations” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 45). Again, Pound performs a similar move of translating <span style="font-style:italic;">tanta novita</span>—“such oddities”—with an emphasis on the newness and innovative nature of Malatesta’s character, its illegibility to those who would see his actions as an unregenerate cycle of illegitimate violence.
	</p>
<p>
	  One possible contention regarding the relationship between Malatesta’s scandalous biographical details and the aesthetic value of the Tempio is that Malatesta’s violence, for all its seeming insensibility, is organized, made sense of, and validated by the achievement of the Tempio. Yet the Malatesta Cantos resist this assertion, in part because violence, practiced in a certain way, can be an aesthetic in its own right. As the practical arm of building the Tempio, incessant and indiscriminate battling paradoxically restores a kind of coherence, if not connectivity, to a cultural matrix freckled by deceit, lies, and petty struggle for personal gain. In a letter to John Quinn, Pound spoke  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to the organizing power of portraying Malatesta as a seemingly disorderly individual, “I suppose one has to ‘select.’ If I find [Malatesta] was TOO bloody quiet and orderly it will ruin the canto. Which needs a certain boisterousness and disorder to contrast with his constructive work.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> As Pound’s letter suggests, his portrait of Malatesta self-consciously foregrounds his “disorderly” qualities and biographical details. It is, in other words, a disorder that registers coherently. Though Pound suggests that this “boisterousness” is antithetical to Malatesta’s more “constructive” work, the Malatesta Cantos ultimately offer a very different understanding of the relationship between disorder and aesthetic construction, one inchoate in the very form of the Malatesta Cantos themselves.
	</p>
<p>
	  Part of the boisterousness Pound discovered while doing the extensive research for the Malatesta Cantos was no doubt Malatesta’s reckless authority, which Rainey describes as “unchecked and arbitrary, his decisions ratified by no one, his choices subject to no identifiable norms or criteria.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> But part of it, as well, can be attributed to the nature of Malatesta’s chosen profession: condottiere. Though a fixture of medieval Italian warfare in certain respects, as Michael Mallett notes, “the tendency of the larger Italian state to expand and develop a more coherent and centralized political organization inevitably led to a greater emphasis on permanent defence.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> With resources traditionally oriented towards trade and finance, not war, Italian cities and provinces reckoned with the problem of a sudden need for protection by contracting armies led by condottieri. Because the relationship between warrior and city was contractually made, as opposed to feudally, the condottieri emerged as a newly professionalized kind of warrior-general, battling without specific allegiance. In the Malatesta Cantos, Pound records Malatesta’s warring in precisely these contractual terms—“Venice has taken me on again / At 7,000 a month”; “Sforza did bestialmente / as he had promised him, Sigismundo, per capitoli / to see that he, Malatesta, should have Pesaro” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 30). As a condottiere, Malatesta’s lack of intrinsic allegiance to any one ruler or city state, and indeed exploitation of this fact, meant that his ting could be the means as well as the ends of personal glory, a way of creating socio-political havoc within the very institution set up to control, order, and regulate the balance of power among Italy’s different local authorities.
	</p>
<p>
	  The similarities between the condottiere and the modern athlete have not gone unnoticed. In the introduction to his authoritative study, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Condottieri: Soldiers of Fortune</span>, Geoffrey Trease suggests,
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    If we are to attempt an analogy with modern professions, however, it might be better to compare the condottiere with the lawyer or the football-player. Each earns his livelihood by engaging in a succession of contests . . . the footballer transfers from club to club. In court or on the playing field, he faces adversaries who may have been his friends and colleagues a little while before—and who may be so again in the near future.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  As Jeffrey Sammonds and Dan Streible have each shown, by the 1920s a number of social and economic factors contributed to the emergence of boxing as an internationally popular sport, and concomitantly to the emergence of a group of professional boxers  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> who could rely solely on prizets and boxing exhibitions for a sizeable income.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> As an emergent class of professionalized ters, modern boxers embodied the condottiere’s disinterested and highly prowessed relationship to military warfare and violence.
	</p>
<p>
	  Indeed, it was Malatesta’s disorderly agitation of Renaissance Italy’s network of alliances, marriage, and religious authority through warfare which the Malatesta Cantos often re through battling terminology and images. At times, this means the use of sporting language to describe Malatesta’s military campaigns, “and he nearly died out in Sparta, / Morea, Lakedaemon, / and came back with no pep in him” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 50). But more often Malatesta is explicitly red as a battler. Canto IX, for example, records that “And [Malatesta] fought in Fano, in a street t, / and that was nearly the end of him.” Likewise, in Canto X, Pound translates a letter of advice from Count Pitigliano, “on the 17<sup>th</sup> of November, ‘Siggy darlint, wd. you not stop making war on / ‘insensible objects, such as trees and domestic vines, that have / ‘no means to hit back . . .” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 42). These are two similar kinds of indecorousness, the first is a t at the outer limits of proper combat (both in military battles and boxing), the second an understanding of war as lacking the decency which creates boundaries between street ts and battles, men and plants. But what both testify to most loudly is the ubiquity of violence and warfare in renaissance Italy, its almost quotidian quality. The double negative in Pitigliano’s letter suggests that Malatesta’s “making war” belongs to a larger complex of militarism’s complicity in the maintenance and production of aristocratic power. In this context, the documentation of Malatesta’s violence is not about violence <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span>, but about the efficacy of violence to achieve particular aesthetic effects.
	</p>
<p>
	  The connection between aesthetic language and violence is one of the Malatesta Cantos’ abiding themes, and one the text approaches in different ways. It is evident in the emergence of obscenity as a constituent force in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span> which the Malatesta sequence marks—opening Canto VIII by putting “Slut” and “Bitch” in the mouths of Truth and Calliope, respectively, and labeling the Pope a son of a bitch in Canto X. As Biographer Charles Norman notes, Pound was so insistent on his epithet for Pius II that when Richard Aldington, acting as part-time editor for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>, cut it out of the proofs for the periodical publication of the Malatesta Cantos, Pound “transferred the epithet to [Aldington] by mail.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> But a more direct connection between linguistic utterance and violence is encoded by athletics, and concerns their confluence in the space of performance. In Canto IX, Pound recalls a poetic contest between Basinio and Porcellio, the proposition of which is whether one can write good Latin verse without having studied Greek:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  And one year Basinio went out into the courtyard
	<br>
	    Where the lists were, and the palisades
	<br>
	    had been set for the tourneys,
	<br>
	  And he talked down the anti-Hellene
	<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 34).
	</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The “tourneys” would have been a series of athletic contests typically held in conjunction with feasts or ritual holidays, abstractions of the more real practices of early modern warfare such as jousting, archery, and wrestling, which recommend the skills  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of battle while minimizing their inherent danger. Pound’s line breaks privilege spatial awareness, enjambing its sense units such that “courtyard” and “palisades” form clear and successively clarifying visions of the location of Basinio and Porcellio, the anti-Hellene. Culminating in the image of the palisaded courtyard, such a spatial awareness emphasizes the connection between this poetic battle and Renaissance athletic tournaments. The layout of the passage on the page further foregrounds this common sense of squared enclosure, an elemental theater of contest that mimics in size and number of combatants a modern boxing match. Likewise, Basinio’s “talk[ing] down the anti-Hellene” should be recovered from the more modern sense of “talk down” as reasoning with an agitated individual, which the OED first records in 1946. Rather, Basinio’s words literally fell Porcellio, echoing aurally two more contemporaneously commonplace expressions: “takedown” and “knockdown.” In the battle of poets within the palisades, Pound envisions a more than analogical relationship between literary intellection and ting, more closely fusing the cultural function of poetic utterance and the play of violence in athletic contest: the performance of a culturally useful skill purely for the demonstration of technical merit.
      </p>
<p>
	In part, the possibility for aesthetics to be “disinterested” or purely concerned with technical merit is precisely what the re of Malatesta obliterates. One of the more familiar narratives of Pound’s career, articulated most clearly by Peter Nicholls, suggests that an early aestheticism was severely checked or repudiated by Pound amidst the confluence of personal and historical circumstances surrounding the First World War.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Hugh Selwyn Mauberly</span>, Pound’s “farewell to London” poem, marks most clearly the death of this aesthete-poet. Though Pound’s relationship to aestheticism throughout his career was complex, the Malatesta Cantos answer <span style="font-style:italic;">Mauberly</span>’s death of aestheticism with a re and aesthetic imbricated with the best and worst of the culture around it. The episode with which the battle of poets rhymes, Malatesta’s near fistt with Count Urbino in Canto X, speaks to the partial and the personal as violence’s most harnessed aesthetic valences:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	And Borso had the pair up to Bel Fiore,
      <br>
	The pair of them, Sigismundo and Federico Urbino,
      <br>
	Or perhaps in the palace, Ferrara, Sigismund upstairs
      <br>
	And Urbino’s gang in the basement,
      <br>
	And a regiment to keep the guards in, to keep order,
      <br>
	  For all the good that did:
      <br>
	“<span style="font-style:italic;">Te cavero la budella del corpo!”</span><br><span style="font-style:italic;">El conte levatosi</span>:
      <br>
	  “<span style="font-style:italic;">Io te cavero la corata a te!</span>”
      <div class="attrib">
	(<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 43)
      </div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Malatesta’s possible fistt remains, even in Pound’s account, shrouded in an indeterminacy which aligns it with the battle of the poets in that language similarly inhabits the space of physical combat. The details of this encounter are obscured in particular ways; Pound cannot conclude definitely whether the exchange between Malatesta and Urbino happened in Ferrara or Bel Fiore. (Furthermore, as it happens, Bel Fiore is in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> fact not the name of Borso’s castle.) Nor can he keep straight the physical logistics of their t, whether upstairs or in the basement, with spectators or without. Yet in this way, violent language itself becomes the orienting device of the exchange; Malatesta’s threat to tear out the Count’s guts restores to this dislocated scene the embodiment it lacks, Urbino’s guts wrested out of his body and into the texture of the poem. The effect is to double the very work this scene does for the Malatesta Cantos at large, which shows Malatesta’s military acumen to be Malatesta’s bilious personality writ large, to be, in other words, as integral to his being as his guts. In an early appraisal of the Malatesta Cantos, Thomas Jackson suggests that “Sigismondo himself is not—cannot be—free of the disorder against which he asserts his ‘factive intellect.’”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Malatesta’s lack of “freedom” from disorder, I would submit, is as crucial as Jackson understands it to be, though substantially less vexed. Rather, the continuity between public and private personalities strengthens the place of disorder as an organizing principle for Malatesta’s actions.
    </p>
<p>
      The battle of the poets; Malatesta versus Urbino. These contrary visions of what place violence can have in an aesthetic are unified in their preference for an elemental theater of battle, a one-on-one contest that dramatizes a larger historical reality. They are indicative of a preference in the Malatesta Cantos for thinking about historical record in wholly embodied terms as the contest between two battling personae. The Malatesta Cantos demonstrate a real obliqueness about the logistics of war, such that so-and-so will “t” at such-and-such a “place,” and this kind of description suffices for what oftentimes is a major battle involving complex military formations. In Canto VIII, for example, a letter from Malatesta’s war camp, dated “<span style="font-style:italic;">aprilis 1449 contra Cremonam</span>,” stands as an historical record of a battle comprised of thousands of individuals and multiple city-state alliances. Rather than falling victim to a poor or obscurantist brand of historiography, the Malatesta Cantos suggest that history itself is this kind of essentialized narrative, an argumentative vision of what is worth cultural record.
    </p>
<p>
      The utility of violence in the life of Sigismondo Malatesta make the Malatesta Cantos not only a biting revision of accepted notions of Renaissance humanism, but also a comment on the status of the arts in post-First World War Europe. At points, this sequence about the relationship between war, violence, and cultural production comes close to the elegiac mood of certain passages in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hugh Selwyn Mauberly</span>, Pound’s most explicit meditation—though even this is an ironic ode—on the ravages of a war on those who “walked eye deep in hell / believing old men’s lies, then unbelieving / came home.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> As Canto XI moves swiftly through a series of battles conducted at Vitelleschi and Fano in which Malatesta fought papal armies for control of the region, for example, Pound records,
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
      And he went by ship to Tarentum,
    <br>
      I mean Sidg went to Tarentum
    <br>
      And he found ‘em, the anti-Aragons
    <br>
        busted and weeping into their beards
    <div class="attrib">
      (<span style="font-style:italic;">CEP</span>, 49).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      If Malatesta, as a rewriting of Mauberly’s dead aestheticism, represents the potential for aestheticism to be constituted by the materiality of contemporary life, it is compelling to see here the case of Pound’s own contemporaneity coloring an instance of that materiality. The lines directly incorporate battling slang into its description of these defeated soldiers. They also anticipate “the busted down pug” Ad Francis at the beginning of Hemingway’s “The Battler,” creating a similar tension through the contrast of such stasis with clear emotional turbulence: “The man looked to be alone. He was sitting there with his head in his hands looking at the fire.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Nevertheless, the pathos of this image is hardly the endpoint for either Malatesta or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>; the near-ceaseless anaphoric use of “and” in Canto XII denies any sort of pause at these moments. In calling attention to these ravages, the Malatesta Cantos offers an historical moment in which artistic and cultural production begin and end in violence, both bound up with and resistant to its obviously lethal effects. Indeed, the attempt to push dizzyingly forward in spite of social agitation is perhaps the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>’ most legible incorporation—at the level of sheer bulk—of Malatesta’s incessant urge to create.
    </p>
<p>
      The implications of this battling aesthetic for the formal features of the Malatesta Cantos—long considered the lodestone of their construction as a modernist achievement— lie in their unrelenting deployment of raw documents without apparent logic or principle, and the explicit threat which this strategy had for the idea of poetry itself. For all of Malatesta’s radical and problematic violence—conquering cities, raping children, murdering friends and enemies alike—Pound’s poetics are charged with a similar violent energy within the realm of literary discourse, an immediately registered attack on the terms and stakes of modern poetry. As Rainey notes,
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	The citation of historical documents, a procedure first adopted in the Malatesta Cantos, seems an especially intransigent form of this practice. The source texts are aggressively quotidian and antiliterary, invoking materials so alien to conventional notions of the ‘poetic’ as to reconstitute the boundaries of subject matter acceptable in poetic discourse.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Indeed, if there is one thing to note about the Malatesta Cantos it is how they amplify a tone of antagonism against existing historico-cultural records, which resonates at a sustained volume throughout the rest of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>.
    </p>
<p>
      Ironically, the major component of this antagonism is not the physical violence or obscenity recorded in the Malatesta Cantos, but the formal arrangement of its sense units. If the re of the battler raises the proposition in boxing discourse that a seemingly chaotic, reckless aesthetic can, in fact, display logical coherence and method when properly looked for, the collage of the Malatesta Cantos reconceives of this proposition in literary terms. Like the courtyard of the battle of the poets in Canto IX, the Cantos are “where the lists were,” and where listing suddenly becomes an act of antagonism. Composed of the prosaic fragments of quotation from historical documents, breaking in its opening lines with high modernism’s poet most <span style="font-style:italic;">en vogue</span>, and written in a creole of Latin, English, American slang, Italian, and nonsense phrases, the Malatesta Cantos announce at every turn the newness and singularity for which literary criticism has prized  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> them. Moreover, they re this newness in the terms which Pound articulated to John Quinn in 1922, as disorder and boisterousness, the selection of quotidian fragments made raucous through their seemingly chaotic deployment. Of course, the Malatesta Cantos attest quite soundly to the organizational logic of these discrete units. Yet to return to the material conditions of their production and the cultural milieu out of which they emerge is to recognize the affinity between these literarily reckless Cantos and the battlers with whom they shadowbox.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">IV</h1>
<p>
      On June 17, 1923, approximately one month after the Malatesta Cantos landed on T. S. Eliot’s desk for publication in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>, Pound saw his sparring style reanimated professionally in a t between Battling Siki and Émile Morelle at the Velodrome d’Hiver in Paris. A Senegalese ter who six months earlier had controversially beaten Georges Carpentier for the light heavyweight world championship, Siki was a trademark battler in style: wild, unorthodox, and reckless. As biographer Peter Benson notes, depictions of him in the Parisian press often shaded these qualities with more overtly racist terminology such as “savage” or “primitive.”<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The t, which Pound attended with Henry Strater, Jane Heap, Robert McAlmon, and Ernest Hemingway, is a fitting capstone to the composition of the Malatesta Cantos in that Siki’s performance suggested both the creativity and the danger of boxing at its stylistic limits. In the fifth round, in defiance of the perceived one-sidedness of the officiating, Siki turned his back to Morelle, refusing to t. Siki would be disqualified in the sixth round for a low blow. Pound would later invoke the match twice in his published writing; in an unpublished letter to his father, dated June 20, 1923, Pound showcases a battler at odds with the institutional structures of ting:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	Saw Siki done out of a decision last Saturday; then a very grave polite and gentlemanly coon so determined not to let the umpire call him on a foul that he simply refrained from hitting his opponent.
      </p>
<p>
	Hem [Hemingway] had his opera glasses on Siki, s’oiseau [Bill Bird] was on the other side of the ring, and we all three had good seats, and could see NO foul. Siki very amusing, and perfectly aware that the cards were stacked.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      It is difficult to overlook the racism of Pound’s language here, though recent work by Michael Coyle and Michael North, among others, has done much to texture our sense of the origins and implications of Pound’s racial views.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> What I wish to point out here, in closing, is the way that Siki’s disqualification against Morelle, with its pervasive fatalism, throws into relief what we might call the implications of this battling aesthetic as practiced in the Malatesta Cantos for Anglo-American modernism. Part of the significance of the Morelle t for Siki’s career was that it effectively labeled him too “dangerous” or “reckless” for French boxing authorities, and led to his banishment by French boxing’s governing bodies. Thereafter, Siki’s career quickly went into a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> tailspin, and in three years he would be murdered in New York over a gambling debt, penniless, drunk, and anonymous. It was, in short, the apotheosis of a career which effectively ended with that low blow in the sixth round. The Malatesta Cantos might be said to share with Siki’s 1923 t a similar sense of climax in Pound’s writing as a touchstone of significance, but their after-effect has been to solidify the importance of formal innovation in definitions of high modernism, indeed, to stake the very ground on which high modernism, unlike Siki’s career, comfortably persisted as a force in Anglo-American letters.
    </p>
<p>
      When seen for their commitments to battling discourse, however, the Malatesta Cantos belie an antagonism and disorder in their formal strategies which challenge such an instantiation, or at the very least alter the terms with which their importance can be evoked. Driven by its logic of oppositional resistance, the Malatesta Cantos dramatize the moment in which modernism’s characteristically self-conscious sense of rupture, couched in terms of formal discipline and rigor, turns inward on the fact that such an ideology had finally found itself at odds with the notions of revolt and the “new” with which it had once been freighted. In other words, the formal innovation of the Malatesta Cantos calls attention to the point at which a commitment to self-reflexivity, as practiced by other modernists, could be prioritized over the rupture and rebellion which formal commitments once represented. Pound’s adversary here, of course, is the poet with whom Pound in 1923 was most closely associated, who first published the Malatesta Cantos, and who is directly provoked in the sequence’s first line: T. S. Eliot. The Malatesta Cantos are important for literary modernism precisely for this prioritizing of havoc, rebelliousness, and superabundance over the precision, traditionalism, and careful tact which Eliot was increasingly beginning to espouse around the same time. In battling with Eliot in the pages of Cantos VIII–XI, Pound casts the lot of literary modernism not with its formal rigor and precision, but with the resonant energy of a ceaseless disruption, and an aesthetic of violence.
    </p>
<p>
      Part of the legacy of this position for Pound’s place in literary modernism, of course, has been his own marginalization, a queasy handwringing over his post-Malatesta textual output precisely because its imperatives both historically and ideologically align with Italian fascism.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Efficacy over nuance, violence over conciliation, antagonism over dialogue: these critical choices which the Malatesta Cantos signify can and have been read as an aesthetics of fascism. And while the Malatesta Cantos very much reflect this proposition, what the battler does is begin to take seriously the way that these aesthetic possibilities are very much in the air in the years after the First World War at a moment when they need not seem wholly fascist, indeed, when they might seem to be—in the fullest sense of the idiom—all the rage. The Malatesta Cantos’ absorption of battler discourse, their deployment of battling terminology and images, and the mediation of the aesthetic valences of violence by this commitment, recovers an interesting moment in Pound’s career because the qualities which later become so associated with fascism in Pound’s writing are revealed to have an alternative genealogy. But the Malatesta Cantos also have implications for literary modernism more generally for the ways that, as glimpsed in the snippet of boxing discourse covered in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this essay, they share an interest in the productively fuzzy line between literary and boxing discourses reflected in the work of other modernists such as Wyndham Lewis, Ford Madox Ford, and Jack London. As the informing aesthetic of the Malatesta Cantos, boxing does not negate the text’s commitments to fascism, but rather suggests ways of talking about those shared aesthetic valences as part of a larger conversation in Anglo-American modernism about the constellation of violence and form, disorder and revitalization, aesthetics and mass appeal, for which fascism has perhaps too long functioned as a tropological default.
    </p>
<p>
      In the Malatesta Cantos, Pound envisions a moment in which reckless violence and the creative environment of chaos are the constituent fabric of the arts, both Malatesta’s Tempio and his own. Years later, in 1945, in the qualitatively different chaos of an open-air, six-by-six foot steel cage at the Detention Training Center at Pisa, Pound scribbled the drafts of Canto 74, and shadowboxed for exercise. As the Malatesta Cantos suggest, the link between these two practices had been formulated far earlier, a matter of ideological import as well as practical necessity for the fate of literary modernism.
