Historians of American music have vigorously acclaimed the rising
young composers of the 1920s. As the legend goes, that decade saw
something special happen, and New York City was the central place
where it occurred. Challenging a conservative and inhospitable music
establishment, res such as Aaron Copland, Henry Cowell, and Edgard
Var&egrave;se struck out on their own to form performance societies and
publishing enterprises that would promote the newest compositions. In
a few short years New York was transformed from a remote outpost of
modernism, a city whose concert life had been suffocated by "the grey
musty presence" of the traditional European repertory (as the critic
Paul Rosenfeld rued in 1920), into "the capital of the musical world,"
as contemporary commentators repeatedly boasted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The composers at the center of these changes deliberately cultivated
 an image of autonomy and iconoclasm. While such a stance was basic to
 modernists throughout the Western world, it assumed particular contours
 in the United States, where the battle for recognition and respect was
 especially intense. Leaders among America's young composers, perhaps
 by necessity, became deft spin artists who shaped gritty images of
 self-sufficiency, often tapping into cherished American myths of
 the pioneer and the inventor. Henry Cowell, for example, described
 his colleagues from this period as "experimental," "uninhibited," and
 "untamed," characterizations that have been repeated over the years by
 subsequent historians. The British critic Wilfrid Mellers, in a survey
 of American music history, titles his chapter on composers since World
 War I, "The Pioneer and the Wilderness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>


<B></B>

<P>
While notions of iconclasm and aesthetic autonomy can account for some
features of the modern-music movement in New York during the 1920s,
they obscure the complexity of the community that brought it into
being. Composers certainly dominated the foreground, but they did not
attain success alone. Theirs was a collective effort rather than one of
isolated trailblazers, and it succeeded because of an intricate network
of publishers, promoters, performers, editors, and patrons. At its core
were women. They often worked behind the scenes, devising strategies to
give the new music viability on the American cultural scene. As Walter
Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony Society, wrote in 1923,
"I do not think there has ever been a country whose musical development
has been fostered so almost exclusively by women as America."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Damrosch was not just reflecting on the recent past, when women had
 worked to establish prominent musical institutions such as the New York
 Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera, but also revealing much about
 the scene in which the avant-garde was taking hold.

<P>
Simultaneously, however, Damrosch's comment also pinpointed the
limitations of women's involvement in modern music: they "fostered" its
growth. Among American modernist composers, few were female--only Marion
Bauer, whose work as composer, critic, and teacher remains insufficiently
appreciated, and Ruth Crawford Seeger, a much more widely acclaimed
re, especially for her innovative <I>String Quartet 1931</I>. Some
women specialized in performing new repertory, most notably the singers
Eva Gauthier, Greta Torpadie, and Radiana Pazmor. Others edited New
York's composer magazines. Minna Lederman was the best known among them
for her work at the helm of <I>Modern Music, </I>a "little magazine"
published in New York from 1924 to 1946; Louise Var&egrave;se, wife of
the composer and noted translator in her own right, worked with Carlos
Salzedo to edit <I>Eolian Review, </I>a harp journal that became a forum
for Edgard Var&egrave;se's International Composers' Guild; and Ely Jade,
a pseudonym for Germaine Schmitz, edited <I>Pro Musica Quarterly, </I>the
publication of yet another modern-music organization, Pro Musica, that
was directed by her husband E. Robert Schmitz.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 While a complete account of the impact of women on New York's new-music
 movement would treat all these res, the focus here will be on a
 sector of female activity that was crucial to shaping the institutional
 network in which modernist composers emerged--the patronage of Gertrude
 Vanderbilt Whitney, Alma Morgenthau Wertheim, and Blanche Walton, and
 the patronage and organizational skill of Claire Reis. These women
 have been largely absent from accounts of the period, partly because
 they chose to keep a low profile and documentation of their work is
 sparse, but partly because of lingering if unacknowledged attitudes
 about gender and the writing of music history. A broader account of the
 new-music movement that explores their contribution can offer striking
 perspectives on this critical decade, revealing close connections to
 patterns of patronage in literature and art; suggesting what might
 on the surface seem an unlikely alliance between social feminism and
 the American avant-garde; and raising questions about the interaction
 between patronage and commercialization in the growth of modernism.

<P>
In 1925 George Antheil, a brash young American who two years later was
to achieve notoriety for the premiere of his <I>Ballet M&eacute;canique
</I>in Carnegie Hall, wrote to Mary Louise Curtis Bok, the woman who was
generously financing his work. While his outcry was typically histrionic,
it articulated the central economic issue for his generation:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If you want composers like Beethoven or Chopin, you shall have to be
prepared to do what the princes of other days did for these people. The
joke of it is that the rich and wealthy people of our States want
these thing[s] <I>without paying for them </I>[underlined twice]. For
<I>nothing! </I>The princes of other days had to pay for them. So will
the princes of today.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Antheil made his appeal, of course, not to the American equivalent of
a prince, but a princess, as did so many of his contemporaries. More
than men, women stepped forward as patrons of the American musical
avant-garde. Whether Mary Louise Curtis Bok in Philadelphia, Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., or Alma Morgenthau
Wertheim in New York City, women of means put their energy and dollars
behind young, often experimental, composers. This was not just a musical
phenomenon or an American one: wealthy European women subsidized the
avant-garde in music, and women on both sides of the Atlantic supported
writers and visual artists. Private patronage experienced a major revival
during the 1920s. In Paris, for example, the Princesse de Polignac
(an American from the Singer sewing machine family) supported Igor
Stravinsky; he dedicated his Piano Sonata of 1924 to her, and many of
his new compositions received private auditions in her salon. She also
subsidized Ravel and Satie, among others.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Well-to-do women also supported writers and painters of the period,
 for example Lady Gregory, who financed Yeats; Harriet Shaw Weaver, who
 subsidized Joyce; or Mabel Dodge Luhan, who supported D. H. Lawrence
 and others. In discussing early twentieth-century modernist writers,
 both European and American, the literary critics Sandra Gilbert and
 Susan Gubar have observed:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A striking characteristic of the twentieth-century avant-garde, after
all, was its determinedly anti-commercial cast. Perhaps there has been
no circle of writers since the sixteenth century which was more dependent
on private patronage, and, like such sixteenth-century res as Sidney
and Spenser, many prominent modernists were subsidized by a series of
wealthy women or publicized by a set of powerful women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Patronage during the 1920s, writes historian Dorothy Brown, was a
"feminized" area, similar to teaching, social work, nursing, and
librarianship; while Minna Lederman, longtime editor of <I>Modern Music,
</I>later observed that the rich felt a deep responsibility to support
the arts during the 1920s, that being a patron then was "like tithing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>


<B></B>

<P>
Such was certainly the case with Whitney, Wertheim, and Walton, who
provided essential financial help and moral support to New York's
concert-music composers during the 1920s. Yet for Americans, private
patronage of composers was a relatively new concept. In the late
nineteenth century, as an American wealthy class rose to prominence
through expanding railroads, mines, and industry, it became involved
in supporting cultural improvement. In music, however, support most
often went toward performance, not composition, and its focus was on
the European repertory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
Just as the notion of being a patron followed European models, so too did
the choice of music to support. The same occurred with American museums:
underwriting the purchase and exhibition of European masterworks brought
a cachet of sophistication and cultivation that local art could not
match. America's wealthy citizens munificently funded the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, and
Carnegie Hall, but with the exception of Isabella Stewart Gardner, who
in Boston at the turn of the century subsidized Charles Martin Loeffler,
they paid little attention to native composers.

<P>
Things began changing in the late 1910s, especially with the work
of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, and by the early 1920s patronage
of composers was becoming more frequent. Though many continued
to support the performance of European masterworks, other patrons
reached out to contemporary American composers, and they made quite a
difference. Suddenly an ambitious group of young musicians did not need
to spend time earning a living outside of composition, as had William
Billings who worked as a tanner in late eighteenth-century Boston,
or Charles Ives who built a successful insurance business in early
twentieth-century New York. Instead they could devote themselves fully
to practicing their art.

<P>
Gertrude Whitney, Alma Wertheim, and Blanche Walton, then, were continuing
an old tradition but giving it a new twist. Each allied herself with
a different faction of the avant-garde, and each shaped her giving
in an individual way. In biographical terms, they sought personal
satisfaction by contributing to a cause that seemed both adventuresome
and important. In an institutional sense, they established a fragile
but crucial network for the early performance and reception of the
avant-garde in New York.

<P>
Although remembered primarily as a patron of visual artists, Gertrude
Vanderbilt Whitney (1875-1942) advanced modernism in America in a
variety of art forms, including music. An accomplished sculptor, she
was a major benefactor of the famous 1913 Armory Show, through which
European modernist painting first reached New York, and her Whitney
Studio Club, located on West Eighth Street in Greenwich Village, led
to the founding of the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1931. Her
involvement in music, while less celebrated, had a similar purpose:
to promote modernism in a society reluctant to accept it. The focus of
her support was the Franco-American composer Edgard Var&egrave;se and
others within the so-called "ultra-modern" camp ("ultra-modern" being
a designation during the 1910s and 1920s for a range of new styles that
seemed either especially experimental or notably distinct


<B></B>


from the music of Western Europe). Whitney's patronage of Var&egrave;se
began in 1917, when she helped underwrite his performance of Hector
Berlioz's <I>Requiem </I>at the Hippodrome, and continued two years later
with his New Symphony Orchestra, a group that in retrospect seems like
a musical response to the Armory Show. Whitney was among a group of four
women who formed the orchestra's "executive committee."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In April 1919 the New Symphony Orchestra gave a concert conducted by
 Var&egrave;se, which included American premieres of works by the European
 modernists Alfredo Casella and B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k. Afterwards,
 in the wake of a harsh critical response, the venture ended abruptly
 with Var&egrave;se's resignation.

<P>
More important was Whitney's position as "one of the principal sponsors"
of Var&egrave;se's International Composers' Guild, founded in 1921 as
an early organization devoted to promoting modernist music in New York
(<I>VLD,</I> 154). Whitney provided the group with direct financial
support and housed its office at the Whitney Studio Club from mid-1923
to late 1925.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 During its six-season existence, the Guild gave a series of important
 premieres, including those of Var&egrave;se's own music and compositions
 by Carl Ruggles, an American composer renowned for writing "dissonant
 counterpoint." Its main activity, however, was directed toward bringing
 the newest European compositions to New York. The Guild sponsored
 American premieres of Stravinsky's <I>Renard </I> and <I>Les
 Noces </I>, Satie's <I>Sports et divertissements </I>, and
 Milhaud's <I>Saudades do Brasil </I>, and its most illustrious
 moment came with the presentation of Arnold Schoenberg's <I>Pierrot
 lunaire </I>on 4 February 1923, eleven years after its world premiere in
 Europe. By then <I>Pierrot </I>was a middle-aged icon of modernism. Yet
 its belated American premiere was more than an example of American
 cultural lag, as historians have often claimed in connection with
 such events. The New York debut of <I>Pierrot </I>occurred at a
 time when the work was being revived elsewhere as well, following a
 break in performances during World War I. Beginning April 1921, the
 Society for Private Performances in Vienna--in many ways the model for
 Var&egrave;se's International Composers' Guild--presented <I>Pierrot
 </I>in both Vienna and Prague.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In January 1922 Darius Milhaud conducted it in Paris (he also attended
 the New York premiere), and shortly after its New York debut Alfredo
 Casella introduced it to Italy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 World War I inhibited the dissemination of other European modernist
 compositions as well.

<P>
In supporting the International Composers' Guild, Gertrude Whitney
was following the example of older members of her family, most of
whom were male, but she did so in her own way. Among the heirs of the
Vanderbilt family fortune, built on ships and railroads, she expanded
her financial base by marrying Harry Payne Whitney, whose money lay
largely in oil and tobacco. Yet the Whitneys and Vanderbilts had focused
their philanthropy on major institutions such as Columbia University and
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gertrude, instead, directed her gifts
to living artists. For her, patronage became a way of relieving what
historian Ann Firor Scott has termed "the inchoate sense of uselessness
which afflicted young women of leisure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 It also helped her cope with an unhappy marriage. After bearing children
 and submitting to the constraints of New York's high society, Whitney


<B></B>


seemed like a wealthy counterpart of Lily Bart in Edith Wharton's <I>House
of Mirth, </I>whom Wharton characterized as "so evidently the victim of
the civilization which had produced her that the links of her bracelet
seemed like manacles chaining her to her fate."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Whitney, in a similar fashion, confessed to her journal in 1901 a
 feeling of uselessness: "I pity, I pity above all that class of people
 who have no necessity to work. . . . [The wealthy are] the great and
 grand unemployed--the dregs of humanity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Patronage, like sculpture, provided Whitney with a means of attaining
 fulfillment.

<P>
Whitney's support of Var&egrave;se appears to have been her primary
activity in new music. Besides helping to underwrite his performance
organizations, in 1921 she gave him what his wife Louise later described
as "an adequate allowance" so that he would not have to take a job
(<I>VLD,</I> 155). It is unclear how long her subsidies lasted. She also
hosted post-concert parties and lectures. After the Guild's first concert
in February 1922, she threw a party at the Whitney Club that was attended
"by practically the entire audience," as Louise Var&egrave;se later
recalled, and in subsequent years there were social events for composers
at the Club and at the home of Juliana Force, Whitney's secretary
and active liaison to artists (<I>VLD,</I> 172). But details about her
substantial support of the International Composers' Guild remain obscure,
in part because Var&egrave;se's papers are inaccessible to scholars and
little about this facet of Whitney's work survives among her papers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 There is a broader reason as well. Looking back on her patronage of
 visual artists, the painter John Sloan observed: "No one will ever know
 the extent of the private benefactions Mrs. Whitney performed through
 Mrs. Force. The records have been destroyed, probably at Mrs. Whitney's
 request. But . . . I know of innumerable artists whose studio rent
 was paid, or pictures purchased just at the right time to keep the
 wolf from the door, or hospital expenses covered, or a trip to Europe
 made possible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P>
Because information about Whitney's music patronage is so sparse, her
importance can easily be slighted. Yet her assistance in launching the
first major organization for American modernist composers made her one
of the earliest patrons to subsidize new music in New York. By extending
the kind of support already being given visual artists to those who wrote
music, Whitney's efforts in the late 1910s and early 1920s helped turn the
attention of American patrons away from performances of European classics,
which were a safe investment with high cultural prestige, and towards
American composers. A kind of venture capitalist for new music, she
supported a key modernist and his institutional forum, confident that her
investment would yield a more vital and imaginative creative environment.

<P>
Alma Morgenthau Wertheim (1887-1953) expanded on the work begun by
Whitney. A decade younger than Whitney and a child of Jewish financiers
rather than Protestant industrialists, Wertheim began her support for
new music within Whitney's orbit, becoming one of several subsidiary
financiers of the International Composers' Guild.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 But Wertheim soon went her own way, largely focusing her support on the
 League of Composers, a rival organization within New York's modern-music
 movement. There were other revealing differences between the two women.


<B></B>


While Whitney's deepest connection had been to the visual arts and her
direct participation in new music had been slight, Wertheim took much more
of a composer-focused, hands-on approach. She was among the dissenters
who broke from the Guild in 1923 to form the League of Composers, she
became an active member of the new organization's board, and she founded
her own publishing firm for issuing new scores.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Wertheim helped turn the League of Composers into a major force in
 American music. Although initially modeling itself on the Guild by
 featuring new European compositions, the League went on to nurture
 native talent, becoming an important sponsor of Aaron Copland and other
 Americans who had studied in France with Nadia Boulanger.

<P>
In yet another contrast to Whitney, Wertheim's work as a music patron
has been better documented, though its sources are still scattered. The
Morgenthau archive at the Library of Congress contains materials mostly
about male family members, especially Alma's father, the financier and
ambassador Henry Morgenthau, and her brother Henry Morgenthau, Jr., who
was secretary of the treasury under Franklin Roosevelt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Her first husband, Maurice Wertheim, owned a Wall Street investment
 firm and was a major patron of the Theater Guild. (Their marriage ended
 in 1929.) Thus information about Alma's legacy largely comes from the
 files of composers--especially Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, and Louis
 Gruenberg--and from interviews with Claire Reis and Minna Lederman,
 two women with whom she worked at the League. Even her daughters (who
 included the late historian Barbara Tuchman) saved few of her papers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P>
Wertheim's efforts took several forms. One involved contributions to
new-music organizations. In addition to providing cash to both the
Guild and the League, she underwrote the League's journal <I>Modern
Music </I>for its first few years, contributing $1500 annually to its
publication costs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 She also gave stipends to individual composers, most of whom fell within
 the League's orbit. Copland was a chief recipient of her help and became
 a kind of hub around which her patronage spun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Ironically, considering that the modern-music movement focused on
 breaking with the past, Copland's link to Wertheim began within the
 social conventions of old New York. In 1925 he made at least two
 pilgrimages to her Upper East Side apartment for tea; both times he
 played some of his music, and as a result she handed him a check for
 $1000. Copland later recalled, "I don't know how, without that, I would
 have managed in the year that followed while I was composing Music
 for the Theatre," recounting a key example of how support networks
 were formed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Copland wrote this jazz-inflected composition for chamber orchestra while
 subsidized by Wertheim; at the same time he had a commission for it from
 the League of Composers. Wertheim also helped others. She presented Roy
 Harris with at least $1800 so he could study with Nadia Boulanger, and
 she provided smaller cash stipends to Israel Citkowitz, among others.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P>
<A NAME="1" HREF="4.1oja_1.html">
<IMG
ALT=""#660066" 1. "
ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/4.1oja_1b.gif"></A>
Another aspect of Wertheim's work was by far the boldest and ultimately
the most monumental: the founding of Cos Cob Press in 1929, which in
the next nine years published some thirty-five volumes of music by young
Americans. These were scores


<B></B>


that commercial houses of the period would never have released. Cos Cob
Press gained distinction as Copland's first major American publisher, and
it also gave publication premieres to Roy Harris, Walter Piston, Roger
Sessions, and Virgil Thomson (see <A HREF="4.1oja_1.html"> 1</A>),
most of whom had some link to Nadia Boulanger or the neoclassical style
then in vogue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Wertheim underwrote all the expenses of the press, and through it
 she joined other women, especially in Paris, who were publishing the
 work of young writers. For example, Nancy Cunard ran The Hours Press
 in the late 1920s and counted Samuel Beckett among her major literary
 discoveries, and Caresse Crosby started Black Sun Press with her husband
 Harry, managing it singlehandedly after his death.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Wertheim was also involved in the firm's operation. She designed the
 cover used for the scores and helped select pieces to issue.

<P>
Yet Wertheim's relationship to composers was volatile. Minna Lederman,
a member with Wertheim of the League's board, described her as "a very
special re in her own circle . . . with beautiful taste for decor,
personal and otherwise, and a very hot, passionate temperament."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Her passion also affected her patronage: just as her tenure with
 the Guild ended explosively, so it did with the League. In the
 November-December 1928 issue of <I>Modern Music, </I>Wertheim's
 name did not appear on the League's Executive Board. It never turned up
 there again. According to Claire Reis, Wertheim resigned because of a
 confrontation over the design of <I>Modern Music </I>and a belief that
 her opinions were not being taken seriously by the board.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The next year she struck out on her own and founded Cos Cob Press.

<P>
Blanche Wetherill Walton (1871-1963) presents an altogether
different case. While Whitney allied herself with Var&egrave;se and the
International Composers' Guild and Wertheim focused on Copland and the
League of Composers, Walton took on


<B></B>


another faction of the new-music community: she became a close friend
of Henry Cowell and some of his colleagues among the "ultra-moderns,"
including Ruth Crawford, Carl Ruggles, and Charles Seeger. All stylistic
experimentalists and mostly hailing from outside New York, although
spending large blocks of time there during the 1920s, these composers
produced some of the more radical compositions of the decade. Walton
was by no means as wealthy as Whitney or Wertheim, and the cash stipends
that she gave were modest. But her big contribution came through offering
housing and hospitality to composers and presiding over a kind of salon
for the ultra-moderns. In other words, she exploited the traditional
female domain of the home to help the struggling avant-garde, becoming
a kind of domestic impresario. Carl Ruggles, an irascible Vermonter
who often stayed in her apartment when in the city, acknowledged her
importance in a 1928 letter: "Keep on, and you will become such a power in
musical circles that all we poor, damned composers will have to do is to
take our scores and our troubles to you and everything will be 'velvet.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P>
Like Whitney and Wertheim, Walton took up her work as part of a search for
personal satisfaction. Unlike them, she had professional potential as a
musician. A gifted pianist who had studied with Edward MacDowell, she was
later described by Henry Cowell as "a pianist of professional calibre in
the days when a public career was unthinkable for a girl of good family."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P>
Instead, after raising two children, she sought a new life in contemporary
music, and her various New York apartments--in Bronxville, at West 68th
Street and Central Park West, and in Washington Square--became havens
for experimentalists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Walton later recalled:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The one contribution I could make to the gifted and struggling pioneer
composer was to turn my apartment on Central Park West into a meeting
place. It was then a shabby elderly house which had a large corner room
which proved to be excellent for a music room with Steinway piano. My
rooms were comfortably apart which left other rooms for visiting composers
of whom Cowell was a frequent one.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Walton's patronage may have been inspired by the work of Edward De Coppet,
for whom her husband had worked. De Coppet was a major music patron in
New York early in the century, noted for having founded and supported
the Flonzaley Quartet, an ensemble holding the status of the Juilliard
Quartet today. And Cowell was most likely responsible for directing her
attention toward composers in his orbit. She met him through the singer
Radiana Pazmor during a visit to California in the early 1920s.

<P>
Walton was involved in the American modernist movement from the very
beginning of the decade. A few remaining letters, housed within a small
collection of her papers at the New York Public Library, suggest the
dimensions of her efforts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 She gave money to the International Composers' Guild.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 More important, she helped support Cowell's New Music Society, founded
 in California in 1925 as a West-Coast counterpart to the Guild. Like
 Var&egrave;se, Cowell initially focused on music by European modernists,
 but he soon became an activist for his American contemporaries,


<B></B>


 most notably through <I>New Music, </I>"a quarterly of modern
 compositions" that he began in 1927 and distributed nationally. Walton
 also supported that enterprise. Principally, though, she gave composers
 free housing in New York. B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k used her West 68th
 Street apartment as a base during his 1927 tour of the United States;
 Carl Ruggles and Henry Cowell stayed with her for long periods; and
 during the winter of 1929-1930 Ruth Crawford lived with Walton
 while she began studying with Charles Seeger. Also, the first meeting
 of what would become the American Musicological Society was held at
 her apartment in 1930.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P>
Walton's private musicales also served an important function for young
modernists. In early December 1929, for example, she arranged an informal
concert in her apartment for Ruth Crawford, which featured the premiere
of Crawford's <I>Suite No. 2 for Four Strings and Piano.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Another musicale, probably scheduled that same year, centered on Aaron
 Copland's work, suggesting that Walton's generosity extended beyond
 the circle surrounding Henry Cowell.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P>
Because Walton did not take on huge financial responsibilities with
new music, like Whitney and Wertheim, or step forward as an outspoken
activist, as will be seen with Claire Reis, her legacy is more difficult
to assess. Measured against today's standards of feminine achievement,
her work could easily be devalued because of its domestic nature. Yet
by establishing a base of operation for struggling young composers
and by hosting musicales, as well as after-concert parties, she gave
essential assistance. The ultra-modern wing of the American composers'
movement was not as well organized in the 1920s as that of the so-called
"neoclassicists." Cowell began the Pan American Association of Compoers
in New York in 1928, which established a crucial forum, but it was
a small organization that had only limited activities its first few
years. By offering up her apartment, Walton gave these composers a
much-needed headquarters for their work--a kind of private club for
radical thinkers. In 1959, Henry Cowell paid tribute to Walton, calling
her "one of the most important and best beloved sponsors that modern music
has had here." He went on to pinpoint the substance of her contribution:
"Much of the activity of composers of modern music was centered in her
home, and we owe to her hospitality an early focusing of modern musical
thought in New York. She created a stimulating atmosphere where nothing
but generosity toward divergent ideas was possible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P>
As patrons, then, these women provided the support necessary for composers
to write, publish, and perform new works. While their gifts took different
forms--whether giving stipends to individual composers, subsidizing
performance organizations, underwriting the publication of music and
journals, hosting social functions after concerts, presenting musicales,
or housing composers--they shared a commitment to advancing modernism
in America. Yet an important part of their role as patrons was to stay
modestly in the background. Louise Var&egrave;se called Gertrude Whitney
"self-effacing," and the same adjective could be applied in varying
degrees to all three (<I>VLD,</I> 153). A woman's place as patron was to
be selfless as well as generous. Her creative energy went into discovering
and encouraging others, not into drawing attention to her own work.


<B></B>

2. Volunteering for the Cause
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
While women patrons stood discreetly behind the scenes, Claire Raphael
Reis (1888-1978), perhaps the most indispensable woman to modernist
musicians in New York, was much more visible, first as executive
director of the International Composers' Guild and later of the League
of Composers. Her "luminous, nourishing energy," as the writer Waldo
Frank once characterized it, became legendary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P>
Diverse ideologies converged to inspire Reis. Ironically, given modern
music's small, elite audience, she approached her task with the tools
and ideals of a settlement-house volunteer. If Gertrude Whitney embodied
the high-society ambivalence of an Edith Wharton character, Claire Reis
reflected the social mission of Jane Addams or Lillian Wald. A consummate
organizer, she had deep roots in important feminized spheres--social
service and the woman's club--and she embraced the goals of social
feminism: to promote reform through vigorous action. While her female
contemporaries labored for the rights of children, new immigrants, and
the poor, Reis took on another of society's underdogs, the composer. Her
activism and progressive roots closely paralleled those of Katherine
Dreier, one of the founders and driving forces behind New York's
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme, an organization begun in 1920 to exhibit
contemporary art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Like the International Composers' Guild, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
 Anonyme came about through the alliance of a French modernist residing
 in New York--in this case Marcel Duchamp--and a high-energy woman.

<P>
Reis's career also reveals much about early musical modernism in New York,
especially the years between 1910 and 1920, a decade that remains largely
overlooked by music historians. Like Blanche Walton, Claire Reis was a
gifted pianist inhibited from becoming a professional by the conventions
of her time and class. While Reis later claimed that her teachers had
encouraged a concert career, "playing for charity was my mother's idea
of bringing up a musical daughter."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 And musical charity became her principal pursuit. But she also happened
 upon modernism while both she and it were young, especially through
 piano studies with Bertha Fiering Tapper at the New York Institute of
 Musical Art (now The Juilliard School).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Tapper held Saturday afternoon musicales at her home, and it was there
 that she presented Leo Ornstein, another of her students, whose career
 she helped promote. While New Yorkers were still concentraing on Brahms
 and Mahler, Ornstein began giving concerts of his own tone-cluster based
 compositions, earning instant notoriety as an "American Futurist." Reis
 later recalled bringing both the writer Waldo Frank and another of
 her good friends, the future critic Paul Rosenfeld, to hear Ornstein
 at one of Tapper's concerts (IVP). For all three, as for others, these
 musicales gave a valuable introduction to music that was just beginning
 to reach America, including recent compositions by Schoenberg, Satie,
 and Stravinsky. Frank vividly recalled an afternoon that probably took
 place in 1914:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The long room [in Tapper's home on Riverside Drive] with a fa&ccedil;ade
of windows giving on the Hudson was astir like a convention of
birds with the elegant gentlemen and ladies perched on their camp
stools. . . . [After Ornstein played some Debussy, Ravel,


<B></B>


 and Alb&eacute;niz], Mrs. Tapper stood up and announced to her guests
 that Leo would now play some of his own music. Leo responded with a
 voluminous, cacophonous broadside of chords that seemed about to blow the
 instrument in the air and break the windows. Chaos spoke [<I>sic</I>].
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Ornstein may have regaled them with his <I>Wild Men's Dance </I>of 1913
or <I>Three Moods </I>of the next year, both of which combined percussive
tone clusters with washes of impressionistic pentatonicism.

<P>
For Reis, encountering Ornstein "was really the beginning, the ear
opening, if not the eye opener for me" (IVP). In the spring of 1916,
eight months after Tapper's death, Reis took up her teacher's mission,
presenting Ornstein in a series of "Four Informal Recitals" at her home
on Madison Avenue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Those events were an important harbinger of the 1920s, as much for giving
 new directions to Reis's work in music as for laying crucial groundwork
 for the composer societies that would make modern music flourish in New
 York. Paul Rosenfeld had proposed the concerts in letters to Reis, and
 as he wrote, a glimpse of her future unfolded:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The point is, that in the back of my mind there is adesire to help
organize a modern music club . . . and I wonder whether an audience
gotten together for Leo's recital couldn't help form a nucleus for such
a society? There's really a crying need for such an organization to make
headway against the sluggish conservatism in musical circles.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
No such organization materialized immediately, but Rosenfeld's letter
shows that the idea for the International Composers' Guild and the League
of Composers was germinating in the mid-1910s, long before either came
into being.

<P>
Significantly, Reis was at the same time helping the poor. In 1911, she
had fulfilled her mother's vision of musical charity by establishing the
People's Music League, an organization that offered recent immigrants
some two hundred free concerts each year in New York schools.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 It was an extension of the settlement house, places such as the Henry
 Street Settlement House in New York or Hull House in Chicago where
 recent immigrants could obtain education and social services. Reis
 later called the concerts her "first satisfying experience combining
 music and social service in a civic project. . . . [It] stirred great
 sympathy [for] people poor and hungry for music."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 For the League's tenth anniversary in 1922 Reis staged a concert of
 contemporary music, which included works by Rebecca Clarke, Louis
 Gruenberg, Frederick Jacobi, A. Walter Kramer, Lazare Saminsky, and
 Deems Taylor, almost all of whom would become prominent in the League
 of Composers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 For Reis, it was a pivotal event:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
My reputation with the Cooper Union Composers' concert led me into

<I>composers</I>.<I> </I>. . . My sympathy for the masses and for music

<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
That fall, after the People's Music League ended, Reis became Executive
Director of the International Composers' Guild. It was a productive
but unhappy


<B></B>


appointment. She moved the concerts uptown to the Klaw Theater, which she
had obtained from a family friend at low rent; she put Alma Wertheim and
the art dealer Stephan Bourgeois, well known for his exhibits of modernist
painting, on the board; and she brought the Guild out of debt. Yet
Edgard Var&egrave;se felt that Reis had "[taken] over" the Guild, and he
disdained her after-concert receptions as "those delicatessen parties"
(<I>VLD,</I> 177, 186). His choice of words, coupled with the extent to
which anti-Semitism has surfaced in speculations about why the League
split from the Guild, may support the view that bigotry did play a rule
in severing the two groups. The anti-Semitism of one member of the Guild,
Carl Ruggles, was well-known at the time; and Virgil Thomson later called
the group the "League of Jewish Composers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 (He had felt ignored by its leaders in the 1920s--the League did
 not sponsor a performance of his work until February 1933--and he
 never forgot his sense of being excluded from the League's inner
 circle.) Claire Reis, however, vehemently denied that anti-Semitism had
 provoked the split, even though a substantial majority of the League's
 members were Jewish: "No, I definitely don't think there was any
 anti-Semitism at all. Salzedo was a Jew, Var&egrave;se's best friend."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P>
Reis's account of the schism focused on two points: the "great disorder"
at the Guild's board meetings and the degree to which some members
took pride in obscurity: "People like Ruggles would loudly voice their
opinions. His was, if more than a dozen people [were] in [the] hall they
were catering to the public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 While Ruggles and others believed that broad audience appeal threatened
 artistic corruption, Reis adopted a more populist perspective. In a
 1923 essay titled "Contemporary Music and 'the Man on the Street'"
 (published in the Guild's unofficial journal, <I>Eolian Review</I>),
 Reis urged that the ideal audience for new music might stem not from
 the "so-called musically educated class," as she put it, but from those
 less committed to the European classics. She went on:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
'The man on the street,' as signified by the average person without
esthetic standards which belong to the past, this man can hear, can
see, can sense an art belonging to his age because it is part of his
life, because he has not been educated to accept<I> definite laws based
upon tradition</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Modernist composers, in other words, might circumvent the audience that
attended performances by the Philharmonic or the Metropolitan Opera,
instead building a congregation of modernists from average lovers
of music whose aesthetic boundaries had not yet been firmly set in
place. Reis never spelled out who would make up this new constituency,
but it seems likely that she had in mind the same working class audience
who had participated in the People's Music League. Social feminism could
benefit modernist composers.

<P>
Not surprisingly, Reis's article was greeted with charges hurled at
other social feminists of the day. Jerome Hart, a conservative music
critic, dismissed her theory as evidence of the depths to which modernism
had plunged:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Of course, this is but a phase of present-day unrestand revolutionism,
which finds its extreme expression in Bolshevism, under which anarchists
are elevated into prime ministers,


<B></B>


 incendiaries and criminals into judges, and all the rules of decent and
 orderly living are thrown into the discard. It is a passing phase, in
 which ugliness, both moral and physical, boldly asserts itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Hart published this not long after the Red Scare of 1919-1920, when
the epithet "Bolshevist" had been hurled at many espousing new ideas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 It hit social feminists especially hard. The pioneering Sheppard-Towner
 Maternity and Infancy Protection Act of 1921, for which women had
 campaigned vigorously, was dubbed "Bolshevist" by its opponents, and
 four years later such name-calling defeated a child-labor initiative in
 Congress. Hart, in short, viewed both the music that Reis supported and
 the audience that she anticipated as subversive, a charge also leveled
 by the composer and critic Daniel Gregory Mason, a professor of music at
 Columbia University and a notorious reactionary against both modernism
 and jazz.

<P>
Reis's work in social service had prepared her for activism in new
music. As leader of the group that seceded from the International
Composers' Guild in 1923 to form the League of Composers, she became
Executive Director of the new organization, a successor in name as well
as spirit to the People's Music League.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 The League of Composers instantly offered a major forum in New York for
 the presentation of both European and American new music, and unlike the
 Guild, which collapsed in 1927, it remains active today. Reis conceived
 the organization in a democratic spirit, similar to other leagues founded
 at the same time, such as the Women's International League for Peace and
 Freedom or the National League of Women Voters. And she was tireless in
 mobilizing its resources. She organized its concerts, staged publicity
 campaigns, negotiated with conductors and performers, hosted social
 functions, raised money, provided office space in her home, and made
 her car and chauffeur available for conducting business. Directing
 the League became a full-time job, though her position was never
 salaried. Aaron Copland later characterized her as "a pro. Her day was
 as highly organized as that of any modern career woman," and his words
 provide an important clue to the context in which she should be viewed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 By no means a radical feminist, Reis fit into a particular breed of
 "modern" woman. Proud to have marched with the suffragists--or so her
 daughter, Hilda Bijur, recalls--she embraced a feminist ideal that
 combined activism with a Victorian sense of womanly duty.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 As one historian has observed, social feminists did not campaign
 for suffrage to advance themselves but "to win the power to clean up
 America. Social feminism was serviceable and safe."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Reis later acknowledged her model to be one of social feminism's great
 architects, Jane Addams, who advocated combining home and family with
 public service. Addams also supported volunteerism for women, and Reis
 later articulated the same philosophy: "In those days if a girl did
 not need to earn money, neither Jane Addams nor Lillian Wald--both very
 modern, liberal women--[did. They] were adamant that girls should not
 work for money" (IVP). To Reis and others of her generation, social
 service was modern, and volunteering provided an acceptable way of
 accomplishing it.


<B></B>

<P>
Also striking was Reis's connection to the Women's City Club of New York,
which was begun in 1916 by a group of suffragists, and, more importantly,
to the Auxiliary of the New York Philharmonic, both of which provided her
with well-tested strategies for running organizations and raising money.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 The Auxiliary had been formed during the 1921-1922 season, though
 its roots went back to 1909, and Reis had joined it the next season.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 She formed her own Auxiliary within the League of Composers in 1927
 and modeled it on the Philharmonic's, using it to finance special
 staged productions, such as those of Igor Stravinsky's <I>L'Histoire
 du Soldat </I>in 1928, his <I>Les Noces </I>in 1929, or Schoenberg's
 <I>Die gl&uuml;ckliche Hand </I>in 1930. The group had a membership
 of around thirty-five, mostly women, each of whom gave a small gift
 of approximately one or two hundred dollars for individual stage
 presentations. Some were recruited from the ranks of the Philharmonic's
 Auxiliary, notably the Countess Mercati, who chaired the League's
 Auxiliary and had served on the executive committee for Var&egrave;se's
 New Symphony Orchestra, and Mrs. Charles (Minnie) Guggenheimer, who
 had also helped with Var&egrave;se's orchestra and founded the famous
 Lewisohn Stadium Concerns in 1918 (an inexpensive popular summer series
 by the Philharmonic).
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Reis, in effect, was transporting the cultivated cachet of the New
 York Philharmonic to the new music supported by the League. Her donors
 supported appearances at the league by world-renowned conductors such
 as Pierre Monteux, Leopold Stokowski, and Tullio Serafin, performing
 well-established compositions by European titans. Yet this procedure also
 had limitations. When Reis asked the Auxiliary members to contribute
 to a composers' fund that would commission new works by Americans, she
 met with flat refusal: "We were keenly disappointed when not a single
 response came from any of the hundred-odd 'pillars of art,' although
 they had gladly spent $250 for a box from which to see and be seen for
 one evening. . . . They seemed little aware of the composer as a fellow
 human being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

<P>
Although the Auxiliary Board made it possible for the League to produce a
series of high-profile American stage premieres, its members often faced
criticism. Minna Lederman recalled that members were often referred to
as "the ladies." But she added: "I don't think they gave money except
when there was an opera coming on. . . . They did so then because of
the glamour of the conductor."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Others felt the same way about analogous groups. Louise Var&egrave;se,
 for example, recalled somewhat disparagingly that Var&egrave;se's New
 Symphony Orchestra had a "large Ladies' Committee" that did "whatever
 ladies' committees do" (<I>VLD,</I> 140).

<P>
Among Reis's many other achievements, a final item deserves attention:
her publication in 1930 of <I>American Composers of Today, </I>the first
catalogue of music by American modernists. While today the compilation of
bibliographies and work lists has become almost commonplace, in 1930, for
these composers, such a source was unique. It served as an invaluable and
highly practical means of giving conductors, performers, publishers, and
critics a sense of existing contemporary literature, and it made access
to these works possible. Two years later Reis produced a revision of
the catalogue with two-and-a-half times as many entries (expanding


<B></B>


from fifty-five names to one hundred and thirty-five), with subsequent
editions in 1938 and 1947.

</H3>

<P>
The involvement of Reis, Whitney, Wertheim, and Walton in new
music during the 1920s has been obscured in subsequent accounts of
modernism, but attitudes already in place at the time helped prepare
the way. Female leaders of composer organizations may have disparaged
the social pretensions of "the ladies" on their auxiliary boards, but
men who viewed these same groups often evinced even broader disdain that
also included women organizers and patrons. Some composers, it is true,
expressed gratitude for the help they had received; Copland and Cowell
publicly acknowledged their debts to Reis and Walton.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 But others all but demonized their benefactors, expressing gendered
 bigotry. Music critics tended to be the most outspoken, often attacking
 women as a group rather than singling out individuals, exposing a
 deep-seated misogyny with many sources.

<P>
On the one hand, the 1920s not only witnessed the birth of a new American
art, straining to free itself from ties to the past and to Europe, but
the continuing struggle of the "New Woman," whose desire for freedom was
equally as intense and ambitious. She threatened cherished traditions,
especially in the first decade after the nineteenth amendment, when
women gained the right to vote. As Minna Lederman put it, "We thought
we could do anything."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>

<P>
That was the "modern" side of the issue. For musicians, however, there
was an even stronger attitude that had roots in the nineteenth-century
notion of music as a feminized sphere. As stewards of the parlor, as
supporters of opera and symphony orchestras, as teachers, and as local
activists through music clubs, women had increasingly gained control
over certain aspects of music-making in the United States. For many men,
this gave music a disturbing air of effeminacy, leading musicians to a
"manliness complex," as a 1924 editorial in <I>Musical America </I>put it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
Women had become associated with the genteel tradition of the late
nineteenth century, and when that tradition faced rejection women
suffered accordingly. This was a major issue in early modernism, and
it remained strong throughout the 1920s. Further, women were viewed as
agents of "conspicuous consumption," to use Thorstein Veblin's famous
term, and so became an easy target in the complex of anti-commercialism
and anti-traditionalism fundamental to American modernism. Increasingly,
consonant music, and especially the pretty sort representing longstanding
European traditions, became linked with effeminacy, while strong
dissonance was labeled "manly" or "virile." Witness a review of one of the
Copland-Sessions Concerts, a series that from 1928 to 1931 was dedicated
to promoting the music of young American composers, in which a compliment
is paid in sharply gendered language: "But there is a pretty high average
in ideas and workmanship, and an an especially high one in virility."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>


<B></B>

<P>
Gender dichotomies frequently overlapped with distinctions between new
and old, highbrow and lowbrow. In an essay published in 1929, Nicolas
Slonimsky, a member of the young generation of composers, illustrated
this process at work. "Yes, we want our musical tastes to be governed
by the young sophisticates rather than by Mrs. Carrie Jacobs Bond"
(a turn-of-the-century composer of popular songs, most notably "I Love
You Truly").
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 Similarly, the composer George Antheil attacked popular tunes of the
 recent past with an obscene and gendered slur.

Women patrons, as highly visible focal points for the tensions
within modernism, were often criticized. In 1920 the critic Paul
Rosenfeld--the same Rosenfeld who was a close friend of Claire Reis and
would become one of the most enlightened voices of the decade (at least
in his concert-music tastes)--wrote an article for <I>The Dial </I>that
discussed the demise of Var&egrave;se's tenure with the New Symphony
Orchestra (the group subsidized primarily by Gertrude Whitney). The
orchestra's failure to succeed in performing contemporary music was
"one of the innumerable consequences of the fact that in America musical
organizations have patronesses more often than they have patrons."

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Great musical bodies cannot exist in America today, it is a commonplace,
without subsidies. . . . But in our civilization, the man is not
interested in art. . . . The control of the purer forms of music are
almost entirely left to the distaff side. . . . But, unfortunately, the
control by women of art is not the health of art. . . . In consequence,
artistic activity remains, for the majority of those who engage in it,
a lightly social expression.

<P>
In the same vein are the remarks of Deems Taylor, a stylistically
conservative composer and well-known critic of the 1920s, who presented
his survey of contemporary music in <I>Civilization in the United
States, </I>a collection of essays that assessed the state of American
culture. "Women," wrote Taylor, "constitute ninety per cent of those who
support music in this country. . . . It is no disparagement of their
activities to say that such a state of affairs is unhealthy." Rather
than being lightweight, as Rosenfeld had charged, women were prone to
"demand that art be edifying" and to encourage chauvinism among American
composers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>

<P>
In 1928, a year after Var&egrave;se's next organizational effort, the
International Composers' Guild, had come to an end, Rosenfeld hailed
the group for its achievements and compared it with its principal rival,
the League of Composers--again in gendered terms. The League, which was
dominated by women, fulfilled "a social function where the performance
of music served the ambitions of mediocrities;


<B></B>


handsomely dressed people conversed up and down the aisles; and music

As critics increasingly connected women to the new-musci movement,
they questioned whether those on the "distaff side" were capable
of intellectual engagement with the bold new sounds they were
fostering. Satire became a frequent weapon. In 1926, the critic
W. J. Henderson published an article in <I>The New Yorker, </I>titled
"The Modern Music Jag," in which he sarcastically pointed out that women
were giving up the Charleston for another fad: new music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 Three years later <I>Vanity Fair </I>published a
 caricature by the famed artist Miguel Covarrubias (see <A
 HREF="4.1oja_2.html"> 2</A>). Captioned "A Salon Recital of
 Modern Music: One of Those Awesomely Elegant Evenings Which Society
 Has to Suffer," it ridiculed wealthy women who presented musicales of
 new compositions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>

 Even in the socially conscious 1930s, when Marc Blitzstein composed
 his leftist work for musical theater, <I>The Cradle Will Rock, </I>he
 depicted a painter and composer who mock their patron as "a stupid woman
 . . . what she doesn't know about music would put Heifetz back on his
 feet again"--and who then eagerly accept an invitation to visit her
 country home for the weekend (scene 6). Blitzstein was saying as much
 about the hypocrisy of artists who accepted support as he was about the
 women who gave it, but he was also drawing on a cultural stereotype now
 firmly established. As late as 1981 the composer Jerome Moross dimsissed
 the League of Composers as not being "a dues paying organization, but
 . . . a pet project of two rich ladies who were constantly struggling
 over the leadership."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>

<P>
Such charges, now and then, have overlooked the importance of the social
functions hosted by women, occasions that made it possible for composers
to integrate themselves into a network of publishers, performers, and
concert managers. Var&egrave;se himself benefited from such events,
whether hosted by Gertrude Whitney or Juliana Force, as did composers
associated with the League. A particularly revealing document in this
regard is an annotated guest list drawn up by Aaron Copland in the spring
of 1930 for a party given by Blanche Walton, probably after one of the
Copland-Sessions Concerts on 13 April.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 Some of the guests were plainly invited for their topicality. The
 program that evening had included three new Hungarian works, Istvan
 Szelenyi's <I>Recitative, </I>P&aacute;l Kadosa's <I>Sonatina, </I>and
 Imre Weisshaus's <I>Piano Study, </I>and a number of Hungarians were
 among the invitees (the Hungarian Consulate General, the violinist
 Leopold Auer, the composer and violinist Sandor Harmati), most likely a
 reflection of Walton's association with B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k. There
 is also a small Polish contingent, in deference to a work by a Polish
 composer that had been performed. But the other invitees show that
 Copland was staging an event that brought together the many powerful
 res associated with modern music. They included leaders of the League
 of Composers, such as Claire Reis and her husband Arthur, as well as
 cofounders Emerson Whithorne and Federick Jacobi; concert managers,
 especially Arthur Judson and F. C. Coppicus, two of the most important
 of the day; and members of the press, especially the British critic
 and composer Leigh Henry and Robert Simon of the <I>New Yorker.</I>

<P>
It was through these mundane yet effective means that women patrons
and supporters played such a crucial role in the rapid acceptance and
institutionalization of modernist music. Yet their role in the new-music
movement in America during the 1920s also raises questions with ongoing
implications. Did women support a musical and cultural form that was
deeply implicated with misogyny? And if so, how did they view themselves
within it? Was the American modernist movement much more elitist and much
less based in counter-cultural impulses than we have often imagined it
to be? Was modernism's "traffic with the emerging world of consumerism
and fashion," as the literary critic Lawrence Rainey has urged, "more
complicated, more ambiguous" that we have often assumed?
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>

<P>
Modernist composers, in many respects, tried to have it both ways. They
constructed an autonomous profile and often took pride in the elitist
constituency to


<B></B>


which their music appealed. Deeply suspicious of the pressures brought
to bear by a mass market, they consciously distinguished themselves from
"commercial" musicians--a designation that was increasingly applied not
only to composers of popular songs, such as George Gershwin or Jerome
Kern, but to conductors of the standard European repertory, such as
Damrosch and Arturo Toscanini, who vigorously marketed the music of
Beethoven and Brahms through the newer media of radio and recordings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 At the same time, though, they sought recognition and success, and they
 were not above using techniques derived from the realm of commercial
 advertising to promote their work. Cowell staged a press conference--or
 as <I>Musical America </I>put it, "an impromptu recital for the benefit
 of the cameramen"--on the roof of the Knabe Building on Fifth Avenue a
 week after his Carnegie Hall debut in February 1924, and George Antheil
 hired a professional agent to promote the New York premiere of his
 <I>Ballet M&eacute;canique </I>three years later.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 Further, composers increasingly sought concert venues that would attract
 widespread publicity. In December 1924 the International Composers'
 Guild moved its concerts to Aeolian Hall, the same spacious facility
 where Gershwin's <I>Rhapsody in Blue </I>had premiered that February,
 and increasingly the Guild's programs featured conductor-celebrities,
 most notably Leopold Stokowski and Fritz Reiner. Even its premiere of
 <I>Pierrot lunaire </I>in 1923 had created a kind of popular sensation:
 the Klaw Theater had been packed, and the audience had included no less
 than the movie star John Barrymore, whom Minna Lederman later recalled
 meeting there.
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 And as already noted, productions of the League of Composers became
 increasingly splashy throughout the course of the decade.

<P>
But what of the women who funded and organized many of these events? Did
they willfilly submit to becoming scapegoats for composers' ambivalence
about success and commercialism? Little evidence survives to indicate
their reaction. Yet Minna Lederman, whom I knew during the final fifteen
years of her life, may provide a revealing example. Although a tough
professional, shrewd political strategist, and brilliant editor, she
never questioned the degree to which she helped build a world that was
largely male. She saw criticisms of wealthy female patrons, the League's
Auxiliary, or even Claire Reis, as being directed at another species. To
some degree, she saw herself as one of the guys, and her sense of being
exceptional may have been more common than we now imagine; some, perhaps
most, of the women attacked by composers and critics may have believed
that the bigotry they witnessed was directed elsewhere. Seeing themselves
as strong intellectuals and gifted administrators, not as representatives
of unpleasant stereotypes, they may have floated above the misogynist
comments that surrounded them.

<P>
However they rationalized their ambiguous status, women patrons were
collaborating with male composers who seemed to be as living in a state
of cultural paranoia. They feared their European contemporaries, who
they felt were viewed as the real thing, while they struggled for crumbs
of credibility. They feared jazz because it posed stiff competition,
especially among continental critics. "American music is not jazz. Jazz
is not music," declared Rosenfeld in the opening salvo of his <I>An Hour
with American Music, </I>essentially a treatise on behalf of American
modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 If they


<B></B>


were descendants of America's Protestant past, they feared Jews, who
were gaining prominence in many arenas of American musical life. And they
feared the women whose patronage and social networks were indispensable
to their careers. "Political, psychological, and aesthetic discourse
around the turn of the century," writes Andreas Huyssen, "consistently
and obsessively genders mass culture as feminine, while high culture,
whether traditional or modern, clearly remains the privileged realm of
male activities."

<P>
Male apprehension about "the 'wrong' kind of success," meaning
commodification, went hand in hand with "the persistent gendering as
feminine of that which is devalued."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 Women patrons and activists, in short, may have symbolized much more
 than the sum of their monetary contributions or hours volunteered. They
 represented gender change and shifting power relations. They highlighted
 the deep dependency of composers on a complex modernist community. They
 also reminded them of the degree to which new technologies were
 abetting the commodification of art. And they were easy targets, in
 part because they seldom struck back, preferring to position themselves
 above misogyny. Of the many paradoxes that characterized New York's
 modern-music community in the 1920s, one of the most vexing is how
 an aesthetic ideal so deeply committed to openness and free-wheeling
 experimentation should have been beset by so many self-constructed
 limitations. If we continue to accept the received account of this
 period, then the stories of Whitney, Walton, Wertheim, Reis, and other
 women who labored for modernism will stay safely within the realm of
 "women's history." If not, we may move closer to a more integrated
 assessment of the American musical past--one that honors all voices
 while keeping in plain view the tensions and paradoxes of the contexts
 in which they were first heard.

Another of the Guild's patrons was Mrs. Christian Holmes, born Betti
Fleischmann and heir to the yeast fortune, who came to New York from
Cincinnati around 1920. She had been head of the board of directors of
the Cincinnati Orchestra (it was she who hired Leopold Stokowski as the
Cincinnati Orchestra's conductor in 1909). An article published in the
Cincinnati <I>Times Star</I> after her estate was settled, gives a rare
view into the dimensions of one person's patronage. Among the reported $20
million that Holmes gave away during her lifetime, $222,812 went to the
Philharmonic Symphony Society of New York, $158,118 to the National Music
League, and $36,500 to the American National Opera Company. By contrast,
her gifts to the Guild must have been too small to be reported ("Holmes
Estate Is $7,836,623," [Cincinnati] <I>Times Star,</I> 23 December 1947;
clippings, Cincinnati Historical Society). Other information about Holmes
comes from: Oliver Daniel, <I>Stokowski: A Counterpoint of View</I>

The split between the Guild and the League ostensibly came over whether or
not the performance of <I>Pierrot lunaire</I> should be repeated after its
American premiere (Var&egrave;se opposed repeat performances, while those
who eventually formed the League favored them). But there was also a power
struggle going on between Var&egrave;se and Claire Reis, and it left hard
feelings on both sides. Probably because of this, Louise Var&egrave;se
gives little credit to Wertheim in writing the Guild's history. She
mentions Wertheim only twice: as one of Claire Reis's appointments to
the Guild's executive board and as a host of Guild meetings (<I>VLD,</I>
177, 185). In addition to her financial and administrative involvement
in the Guild, Wertheim wrote at least one article promoting its work,

17 December 1922.

that "a musical career was the last thing in the world [his father]

girls. Alma, one of my father's three sisters, trained her voice to the
edge of professionalism; later she became a discriminating and demanding
patron of avant garde composers like Arnold Schoenberg and Aaron Copland"

While New York composers tended to fall into separate ideological
camps after the split between the Guild and League, there was some
overlap. For example, a letter from Carl Ruggles to Blanche Walton,
written in 1926, shows that Wertheim continued to reach out to Ruggles,
one of the ICG's principal res: "Curious: Dr. Bartlett forwarded
a note from Mrs. Wertheim asking about me, and what I was doing, and I
answered her a fortnight ago, but have received no reply" (Ruggles to

Collection, Box 1a. Tapper (1859-1915) was an interesting re
in her own right. Born in Norway, she had studied in Leipzig with Carl
Reinecke and Louis Maas, and was friends with Edvard Grieg, for whom
she edited two volumes of piano compositions. Like many women, Tapper
focused her career on nurturing others. A. Walter Kramer, editor of
<I>Musical America</I> and another member of the circle that included
Tapper and Reis, noted this trait: "And so she lived, for others, never
for herself . . . I know that she composed much and that she destroyed
it, never wishing to have her music appear in print" (A. Walter Kramer,
"Bertha Fiering Tapper: Altruist [obituary]," <I>Musical America</I> 22
[25 September 1915]: 9).

<I>Memoirs of Waldo Frank,</I> ed. Alan Trachtenberg (Amherst: The
University of Massachusetts Press, 1973), 65. Since Frank describes
Ornstein as "just back from overseas successes," 1914 is a likely year
for this event left undated by Frank; Ornstein had just returned to
New York then after a highly acclaimed recital in London. There were
other connections between Frank and Reis. His first wife was Margaret
Naumburg, with whom Reis started the Walden School; and Reis's husband
Arthur, whom she married in 1915, was business adviser to Frank's little
magazine, <I>The Seven Arts,</I> which ran from 1916 to 1917. Arthur
Reis was president of Robert Reis and Company, a firm established by
his father that manufactured men's underwear.

Reis, typescript resume, dated 6 January 1952, NYMD, Reis Collection, Box
1. The date of the inception of the People's Music League appears to be
1911. In Reis's biography (included in "Notes on Contributors," <I>Eolian
Review</I> 2 [March 1923]: 28), it is given as that, also in several sets
of typescript notes at NYMD, Reis Collection, Box 1. However, in one of
her interviews with Vivian Perlis, Reis stated 1912 (21 January 1976),
and Perlis gives that year in her article about Reis for <I>The New Grove
Dictionary of American</I> <I>Music,</I> vol. 4, 28. As Reis tells it,
her founding of the People's Music League came about under the aegis of
Maurice Wertheim, husband of Alma Morgenthau, who gave her a letter of
introduction to Frederic Howe of the People's Institute. Mrs. Maurice
Wertheim (Alma Morgenthau) became a member of the advisory council of
the People's Music League.

Jerome Hart, "Modern Music: Its Appreciators and Depreciators," <I>The
Sackbut</I> 4 (November 1923): 102. Hart was a frequent contributor to
<I>The Freeman,</I> a journal for which Daniel Gregory Mason also wrote
(in fact he also discusses a contemporaneous article by Mason in this same
piece), and his language in <I>The Sackbut</I> sounds similar to that of
the critic Henry T. Finck, suggesting a pattern of linking revolution,
feminism, and modernist music: "Sch&ouml;nberg learned a lesson
from the militant suffragettes. He was ignored till he began to smash
parlor furniture [and] throw bombs" ("Schoenberg and the Suffragettes,"
<I>Musical Progress</I> [New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1923], 393). The
text of this excerpt is in turn very close to that of an unsigned review
in the New York <I>Post</I> on 27 January 1914; Finck was then music
critic for that paper. Connections between misogyny and modernist music
are explored in Catherine Parsons Smith, "'A Distinguishing Virility':
Feminism and Modernism in American Art Music," in <I>Cecilia Reclaimed:
Feminist Perspectives on Gender and</I> Music, ed Susan C. Cook and Judy

composers of the 1920s were homosexual, women were not the only threat
to "manliness." Decades later Louis Gruenberg would rue, to Claire
