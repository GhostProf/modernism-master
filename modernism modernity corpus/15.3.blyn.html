<p>
      In the first chapter of Djuna Barnes’ <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, Baron Felix Volkbein “owe[s] his first audience with a ‘gentleman of quality’” to the Duchess of Broadback, the trapeze artist otherwise known as Frau Mann.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Like the “Duchess” and the “Baron,” Count Ontario Altamonte’s claim to aristocracy is suspect, and among the “impossible people” who gather to receive him, only Felix, devoted as he is to the “great past,” seeks to pay him homage (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 13, 9). When Felix arrives, however, he finds that instead of the Count, it is Dr. Matthew O’Connor who is holding court. Rather than being received by royalty, Felix becomes part of an “audience” for an entirely different performance: the discursive dexterity of the putative doctor. The centerpiece of that performance is O’Connor’s account of Nikka, “the nigger who used to t the bear in the Cirque de Paris” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 16). “Tattooed head to heel with all the <span style="font-style:italic;">ameublement</span> of depravity” (ibid), Nikka’s body brings together the tattooed man and the African savage, two standard exhibits of the American freak show stage. Like O’Connor, Nikka is a performer, and O’Connor’s account of him is thus a meta-performance in which the Coney Island freak shows that Barnes knew so well converge with the decadent aesthetic which informs virtually everything she wrote.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
      As embodied in Nikka, the freak show performer becomes heir to the Decadent Aesthetics of the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> as read through the historical context of the 1930s, the decade in which avant-garde modernists witnessed the simultaneous consolidation of fascism in Europe and the culture industry on both sides of the Atlantic.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Like Nikka, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s neo-Decadent performance is inseparable from the discursive and material effects that attend  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> both of these historical events. For if, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, a critically appropriated version of the Decadence of the 1890s paradoxically registers the novel’s protest against fascism, its debt to the traditions of the American freak show underscores the extent to which the novel recognizes the famed aesthetic autonomy of the Decadent subject as dependent upon the liberal capitalism from which it emerged. Despite the fact that writers associated with Decadence in the last decades of the nineteenth century variously negotiated commodity culture, as Walter Adamson has recently argued, avantgarde modernists, particularly throughout the interwar period, came to understand their own projects as breaking with Aestheticist “religions of art” dependent upon “the illusion of autonomous control over culture by intellectuals.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Equally informed by the changes in the American culture industry observed by Barnes in her journalism and by a Decadent Aesthetic borrowed from abroad, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> presents a dandy that is always and inevitably a freak.
    </p>
<p>
      Celebrating Nikka as a “depraved” savage, O’Connor complicates the discourse of the “noble savage” particular to the modernist avant-garde, its appropriation of the “primitive” as an alternative to the ossified forms of Western art and subjectivity, and he does so by rendering Nikka not only the object of his art, but a decadent performer in his own right. A juxtaposition of eclectic quotation, Nikka’s tattooed body can surely be seen as a “mimesis of subjection,” for written on his body is “an iconography of Western racist and colonial discourses.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> In addition to the Shakespearean “Desdemona” tattooed on his penis and the words “I can” tattooed across his knees, O’Connor reveals that Nikka has adorned his body with an angel from Chartres, a Jansenist quotation from a book of magic, two “arrow-speared hearts” dripping blood, a trade ship, and references to both the Houses of Tudor and Rothschild (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 16). Yet while Nikka’s subjection is written on his racialized and sexualized body, as a textual performance his body can also be seen as a parodic resignification of Church and State in which the borders between the spiritual, the erotic, and the aesthetic are themselves subject to decay.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> With Jansenist allusions across his buttocks, the angel of Chartres on his belly, Desdemona on his penis, and the “swart rambler rose copied from the Hamburg house of Rothschild” along his legs, Nikka’s body spiritualizes the erotic, eroticizes the spiritual, and renders both aesthetic.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Heir to the aesthetics of Joris-Karl Huysmans, Oscar Wilde, and Aubrey Beardsley, Nikka performs a Decadent art that serves as an immanent critique of the hegemonic order that would delimit and circumscribe his self-making. Inseparable from the fascism of the 1930s, it is an order prone to the conflation of Decadence with degeneracy. Challenging the discourses that would identify him as degenerate specifically through his Decadent embodiment of them, Nikka’s performance locates the political stakes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s privileged performative subject: its Decadent resistance to fascist instrumentalization.
    </p>
<p>
      In so far as Nikka turns himself into an aesthetic object because he “loved beauty and would have it about him” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 17), he is the inheritor of a Decadent Aesthetic practice whose resurrection in the 1930s represents a critical appropriation tailored to, and reflective of, its own historical moment. Distinguishing Nikka and <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> from their dandified precursors of the 1890s, and even from their <span style="font-style:italic;">flaneur</span> ancestors  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the mid-nineteenth century, is neither their commodification nor their awareness of that commodification. Rather, what marks <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> and its freak dandies as <span style="font-style:italic;">neo</span>-Decadent is the extent to which their Decadence requires an overt disavowal of aesthetic autonomy, a disavowal made requisite by the construction of desire under liberal capitalism in the post-Keynesian era and by the illusion of autonomy propagated by culture industries on both sides of the Atlantic. A pastiche of “improbable juxtapositions” advertising their “perverse irony,” paradox, and “enigmatic symbolism,” Nikka’s body is a paradigmatic Decadent text put in the service of the culture industry.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> With Nikka, the dandy has become a freak, a spectacular commodity fetish and the subject/object of what the Nazis would name degenerate art. In Barnes’ novel, the only way to counter fascism will be within the terms of the commodity fetishism perfected in the marketplace of the liberal capitalism contemporaneous with it.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>
      It is in the 1930s, after all, that Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer famously identify the commodity fetish as the product of the American culture industry and associate it with the provocation of a desire that is “endlessly prolonged,” immune to satisfaction.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, the notion of economic health premised on the production and prolongation of desire was considerably more widespread, pervading sexual theory, economic theory, the advertising industry, and business strategies of the decade. As critics such as Walter Sussman, Rita Barnard, and Michael Tratner have detailed, the 1930s is <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> decade in which the production of desire becomes an essential activity of a capitalist economy premised, on the tide of the Keynesian revolution, on expenditure.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> As Tratner writes, it is in the context of Keynesian economics that “[s]timulating consumption involved increasing desires and, what is more important, creating them.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Desire is the watchword of the discourses of political and libidinal economies in the 1930s, Tratner maintains, at once a civic duty and the road to economic and sexual health. At the center of these overlapping economies, then, is the commodity fetish, charged as it is with the production, stimulation, and prolongation of desire. Hence, as <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s freak dandies prolong and suspend desire, they perform the very “ritual of Tantalus” that Adorno and Horkheimer attribute to the commodity fetish.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Rather than aesthetic or individual autonomy, Barnes’ novel presents a subject/object whose Decadence is defined by an explicit rejection of both. In the form of its freak dandies, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> makes subjectivity and art the stuff of the commodity fetish, for it is only by soliciting and prolonging desire, the very work of the commodity fetish as it was conceived in the 1930s, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s freak dandies can remain disowned.
    </p>
<p>
      As it argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s resistance to fascism within and without the fascist state lies specifically in its revival and revision of the Decadent Aesthetics of the 1890s, this essay offers an alternative to the two most important studies of the novel’s relationship to fascism, Jane Marcus’ “Laughing at Leviticus: <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> as Women’s Circus Epic”  and Erin Carlston’s “‘The Learned Corruption of Language’: <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Failed Flirtation with Fascism” .<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Written amid and for the invaluable “reevaluation of Djuna Barnes” undertaken in the 1980s, Marcus’ essay reflects both the feminist perspective that informs much of that work and the enormous impact of the translation of the work of Mikhail Bakhtin on the literary scholarship of that decade. Bringing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> together Julia Kristeva’s theorization of the abject and Bakhtin’s construction of the “carnivalesque,” Marcus’ argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is a “feminist-anarchist call for freedom from fascism,” a “book of communal resistances of underworld outsiders to domination [whose] weapon is its laughter, a form of folk grotesque derived from Rabelais and surviving in the circus”(“LL,” 221). Political and liberating, the carnivalesque reversals and transgressions Marcus identifies in the text allow her to celebrate <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> as a collective rebellion of “outsiders” against the rise of fascism. She writes, “I believe <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is the representative modernist text, a prose poem of abjection, tracing the political unconscious of the rise of fascism, as lesbians, blacks, circus people, Jews, and transvestites—outsiders all—bow down before Hitler’s truly perverted Levitical prescriptions for racial purity”(“LL,” 231). In Marcus’ hands, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> prophesies the Holocaust and rebels against it, and it does so specifically through its carnivalesque transgressions of “Levitical prescriptions.” Marcus’ carnival, equated with the circus, becomes “redemptive.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The differences between Marcus’ position and my own reveal themselves in a critical reframing that requires a paradigmatic shift from the “carnival” to the “freak show,” for in its deployment of the carnivalesque, “Laughing with Leviticus” implicitly denies both the emphasis on spectacular performance that informs the art of the novel and the context of the liberal capitalism in which those performances take place.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> By identifying the novel with the freak show rather than the carnival, I am insisting that in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> there is no utopian, pre-capitalist democratic space outside of “the society of the spectacle” or the instantiation of liberal capitalism that Guy Debord rightly identifies with it in postwar France.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> As “the opposite of dialogue,” Debord argues, “the spectacle subjects living human beings to its will to the extent that the economy has brought them under its sway. For the spectacle is simply the economic realm developing for itself—at once a faithful mirror held up to the production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Here, Debord very nearly defines the spectacle as a freak show, the realm of “distorting objectification” that proponents of the carnivalesque, like Marcus, seek to evade. The carnivalesque aesthetic Marcus identifies in the novel would presumably destabilize the subject-object divide upon which spectacle depends, thereby contesting the objectifying power of the economic realm that produced it. Yet, to make such an argument is to evade the historical and economic transformations that render Bakhtin’s carnival necessarily obsolete. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> does not conjure a pre-capitalist utopia any more than it voices “the struggle of an emerging subculture,” and its appropriation of an aesthetics of spectacle indexes its complicity with capitalism and the immanence of its critique of bourgeois rationalism.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> If Debord’s “society of the spectacle” had not yet emerged in France in the 1930s, Barnes’ novel, informed as it is by the American culture industry, offers a prescient representation of it.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In rejecting Marcus’ utopian claims, my argument follows in the footsteps of Erin Carlston, to arrive, however, at different conclusions. “The Learned Corruption of Language” explores what Carlston sees as the overlapping ideological traces of decadence and fascism in Barnes’ novel. Her work implicitly poses the central question animating  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> my own study: What does it mean to be decadent in 1936? Carlston answers this question by way of Walter Benjamin, concluding that the Decadence of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is the mark of its engagement with fascist ideology. Citing Benjamin’s famous contention that fascism is “the consummation of <span style="font-style:italic;">l’art pour l’art</span>,” she contends that the aestheticization of life intrinsic to Decadence becomes the pre-condition of its aestheticization of politics, and it is precisely this aestheticization of politics that Benjamin identifies as the signature accomplishment of fascism.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Carlston, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence thus becomes an index of its ambivalent alliance with fascism. “It is only with regret,” she concludes, “that Barnes finally dismisses fascism’s utopian fantasies of immediacy and fusion with the mother/tongue at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>.” “[W]hile decadence is neither equivalent to nor totally assimilable to fascism,” she insists that the two are genealogically and ideologically linked.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> It is on this point that my argument definitively diverges from Carlston’s own: I contend that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> reveals the logical and historical problems inherent in reading Decadence as an indexical sign pointing inexorably to fascism.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In the following pages, I suggest that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> represents neither an ill-fated romance with fascism nor a revolutionary protest against it. Rather, as a Decadent freak show, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> performs an immanent critique of fascist instrumentality, one that challenges the equation of Decadence with degeneracy performed under the aegis of fascism. In the process the novel offers an implicit critique of a significant body of critical theory that has established Decadence as the unwitting progenitor of fascism. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s neo-Decadence thus makes visible the critical limits that attend the claim that Decadence leads inevitably and necessarily to fascism, even as the novel reveals the aesthetic autonomy associated with the Decadence of the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> as an illusion with its own potential for instrumentalization.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Between Decadence and Fascism: Imagined Pasts</h1>
<p>
	The title of Andrew Hewitt’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Modernism: Aesthetics, Politics, and the Avant-Garde,</span> published in 1993, speaks forcefully to the growing awareness among cultural critics that the well-policed borders separating fascism from modernism, so firmly established in the aftermath of World War II, could no longer be maintained. As Hewitt writes, “Fascist modernism is not just a branch of modernism, not a quirk nor an exception; it is instead—theoretically if not empirically—<span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> single most pressing issue for theories of the avant-garde.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> If we accept Peter Bürger’s contention that the avant-garde is defined as an attempt to reintegrate art with the praxis of life, Hewitt demonstrates, fascism is as central to the historical avant-garde as dada, surrealism, and Russian constructivism.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> It is only because of his own leftist proclivities, his refusal to see the implications of his own definition of the avant-garde, that Bürger fails to admit either futurism or fascism into the hallowed, if compromised, halls of the avant-garde. Carlston’s study of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is informed precisely by her recognition of the intercourse between fascism and modernism charted by writers like Hewitt. Yet, following Hewitt, I would contend that the numerous correlations she adeptly draws between  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s neo-Decadence and the fascism of the 1930s actually convey their mutual place in the historical avant-garde, rather than their ideological or political affinities. From this perspective, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s neo-Decadence is no more or less fascistic than any other avant-garde practice contemporary with it.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Admittedly, posing the Decadent, half-Jewish, and falsely titled Baron Felix Volkbein next to Nikka apparently invites a contrary conclusion, for one could well argue that it is in precisely in their Decadence that they confirm the two most influential theories linking fascism to Decadence. As it combines Shakespearean allusion with Jansenism, the Houses of Tudor and Rothschild, the “indecent” and the “Gothic,” Nikka’s tattooed body pays tribute to the Decadents’ tendency to “seek out the aristocratic and spiritual trappings in an imagined old regime,” the very project most explicitly undertaken by Felix Volkbein in his quest for “the great past.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> It is hence not surprising that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> enmeshes Felix in a Decadent genealogy. If his father is a “gourmet and a dandy” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 1), his son is “born to holy decay”: “emotionally excessive, an addict to death” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 119), the embodiment of Decadence at the end of the line. Inheritor and progenitor of a decadent tradition, it is Felix who worships the past, “what he termed ‘Old Europe’: aristocracy, nobility, royalty,” searching “for the correct thing to which to pay tribute” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 9). It is precisely because of his desire to revive his “imagined old regime” that Felix pursues and marries Robin Vote, for he views her as “newly ancient” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 42), carrying “a sort of odour of memory, like a person who has come from some place that we have forgotten and would give our life to recall” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 118). Searching for something to bow down to, seduced by an enigmatic embodiment of the archaic past, Felix seems to be waiting with uncanny precision for nothing so much as for fascism. In Felix, Decadence not only resembles fascism; it seems to be the very condition for its emergence.
      </p>
<p>
	The fact that both Felix and fascism define themselves through the project of reviving “an imaginary old regime” suggests that Decadence paves the way for fascism for the very reasons asserted by Georg Lukács and Walter Benjamin.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Yet, while both Lukács and Benjamin would allow for provocative readings of Felix and the novel in which he appears, neither reading will ultimately suffice, for in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, Decadence is neither a sentimental education (Lukács) nor an aesthetic training ground (Benjamin) for fascism. Even if Felix’s seduction by the archaically-coded Robin Vote in some way represents the conversion of the Decadent subject to fascism, it is a seduction that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> subjects to relentless critique. The marriage between the two is a short-lived disaster that results only in the birth of a child whose “sanity is an unknown room” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 120). Thus, if in his longing for the imagined past Felix displays a structure of feeling and/or a will to aestheticization that fascism exploits in its own ideological constitution, it is because, as incarnations of the historical avant-garde, Decadence and fascism respond to similar perceptions about modernity, that is, to the dislocations, alienations, and rationalizations that might encourage a desire to revive a prior (a)historical moment. Because they respond to similar circumstances, however, in no way suggests that Decadence is equivalent to fascism or the reverse, that fascism is inherently Decadent in the literary/aesthetic sense of the term.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Moreover, neither the Aestheticism of Felix nor of the novel in which he appears can be identified with a fascist aesthetic. Obsessed by “Old Europe,” its ruins and its aristocracies, Felix would be anathema to the cult of youthful masculinity, populism and vitalism central to fascism, especially as promulgated in Italy. If, as Jeffrey T. Schnapp writes, fascist modernity is defined by the tensions between a “revolutionary activism and institutional conservativism, between the celebration of heroic individualism and corporate conformity, between elitist and populist values, between cultural internationalism and nationalism, between antihistoricism and historicism,” Felix’s arch-conservativism hardly fits the bill.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> So, too, in 1936, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> appears as a compendium of the features that the Nazis would denounce in their massive “Degenerate Art” exhibition the following year. It is not simply that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> revolves around Jews, lesbians, and a homosexual man given to transvestism and liturgical heresy; rather, the very stylistic features that make <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> such an exemplary Decadent text are the features that ensure its status as fascism’s aesthetic other, “degenerate art.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s “elaborate, highly artificial, highly ornamented, often tortuous style”; its tendency to “disruption, fragmentation, and paradox”; its delight in “perverse irony” and subjectivism, all make it as stylistically unassimilable to fascist mimesis as to the normative agenda of fascist idealism.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Thus to suggest, as readers of Benjamin are especially tempted to do, that there is a simple teleological link between Decadent art and fascism, is to deny the dialectical nature of Benjamin’s thinking, for it is a conclusion that requires the critic to assert the independence of ideological and aesthetic domains. To thus separate ideology and aesthetics is an admittedly serious temptation for critics, given that Decadents themselves often made that claim. Yet it is precisely as Decadence revalues the uselessness of the Aesthetic, its resistance to assimilation by rationalizing forces of modernity, that it reveals its ideological and political investments. If, as Andrew Hewitt writes, a decadent praxis results only in a “decadent decadence,” one that negates itself in its very assertion, the conundrum is in no way specific to the fascist moment; Decadence has always been Decadent, in the sense that <span style="font-style:italic;">l’art pour l’art</span> has always been a dissent against ideological hegemony.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Art for art’s sake, in other words, has always been <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> something else.
      </p>
<p>
	As an exemplary neo-Decadent text written against the background of Mussolini’s consolidation of power and Hitler’s rise to dominance, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> testifies to the fact that it is simply not possible to give Decadent Aesthetic form to the fascism of the 1930s without altering its ideological content. That is not to deny that Decadence shares with fascism the currents of thought common to their historical moment, or that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> engages with the same discourses of biological racism and degeneration as did the Nazis. Rather, it suggests that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence cannot suffice as an index of the text’s fascist sympathies. On the contrary, in the face of fascist instrumentalization within and without the fascist state, Aesthetic Decadence in the 1930s inevitably constitutes a praxis.
      </p>
<p>
	What <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence does index, however, is the novel’s debt to liberal capitalism, a fact made visible in a comparison of the novel with Matei Calinescu’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> distinctly liberal reading of Decadence. In contrast to Lukács and Benjamin, Calinescu offers an analysis in which Decadent Aestheticism implicitly holds the potential to negate, if not to subvert, fascism. In his conclusion to an analysis of Paul Bourget’s seminal <span style="font-style:italic;">Theorie de la decadence</span>, Calinescu seems to celebrate the individualism and anarchism Bourget attributes to decadence. “To prefer decadence to its radical opposite (that is, barbarism) appears, at least culturally, to be a legitimate choice,” Calinescu writes, for “a style of decadence is simply a style favorable to the unrestricted manifestation of aesthetic individualism, a style that has done away with traditional authoritarian requirements such as unity, hierarchy objectivity, etc.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Thus Calinescu offers “aesthetic individualism,” as personified in the Decadent dandy, as both an extension of liberal individualism and an alternative to a “barbarism” he associates with “nationalism and militarism,” that is, with fascism. Decadence thus not only rejects “the tyranny of tradition,” but the tradition of tyranny, and it is an unmistakably bourgeois dandy who saves the day.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

	As in Calinescu’s assessment, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadent freak show effectively counters fascism’s instrumental subject, along with its aesthetic. However, the freak dandies it exhibits as aesthetic subject/objects emerge from no space prior to or outside of the scene of their aestheticization, the capitalist marketplace; it is only by exploiting the very structure of desire intrinsic to liberal capitalism, as it was conceived in the 1930s, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s freak dandies resist rationalization—whether that rationalization be conducted under the aegis of national socialism or liberal capitalism. Barnes’ novel thus reveals the anarchic, subversive individualism that Bourget and Calinescu celebrate in Decadence as a product of liberal capitalism; from the perspective of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, the subject of “aesthetic individualism” is, inevitably, the commodity fetish.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Between the “Invert” and the “Jew”:The Missing Link</h1>
<p>
	Any interpretation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s relationship to the fascism contemporaneous with it turns inevitably to the problem of the novel’s portrayal of the Jew, for there is no doubt that the language used by the narrator and by O’Connor to characterize Jews partakes of the same essentialist and anti-Semitic language employed by the Nazis.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> “What had formed Felix from the date of his birth to his coming to thirty was unknown to the world,” the narrator writes, “for the step of the wandering Jew is in every son. No matter where and when you meet him you feel that he has come from some place—no matter from what place he has come—some country that he has devoured rather than resided in, some secret land that he has been nourished on but cannot inherit, for the Jew seems to be everywhere from nowhere” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 7). Nomadic, voracious, mystically disinherited, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> every Jew is a “Wandering Jew,” the threatening and denigrated other required by a fascist subject defined ideologically in terms of the entitlements of “blood and soil.”
      </p>
<p>
	Yet as <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> constructs its Wandering Jew as a freak dandy, it also creates the Decadent subject/object of desire that resists rationalization. Mobilizing a freak show aesthetic of indeterminacy accomplished in the interplay of the visual art of tableau and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the verbal art of spiel, Barnes’ novel turns the Wandering Jew into a privileged re for the “stylized irresolution” that characterized the Decadent art of the 1890s.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Forty years later, that signature irresolution performs an immanent critique of instrumental reason as promoted within and without the fascist state. By turning the Wandering Jew into an exhibit for the freak show stage of the 1930s, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> allows him to escape, to wander away from the discourses of eugenics and degeneration theory that would hold him in place.
      </p>
<p>
	While the practices of freak show exhibition have varied considerably even within a given historical moment, archival research and the collection of personal testimony has made it possible to identify the main elements of freak show display as they were conventionalized in the U.S. in the nineteenth century. Following Robert Bogdan’s groundbreaking research into “the social construction of freaks,” a body of criticism emerged that details the historically specific ways that, as Rosemarie Garland Thomson writes, unusual bodies were fashioned into freaks.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Within this “freak discourse,” she contends, are “four entwined narrative forms”:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  [F] irst, the oral spiel—often called the “lecture”—that was delivered by the showman or “professor” who usually managed the exhibited person; second the often fabricated or fantastic textual accounts—both long pamphlets and broadside or newspaper advertisements—of the freak’s always extraordinary life and identity; third, the staging, which included costuming, choreography, performance, and the spatial relation to the audience; and fourth, drawings or photographs that disseminated the iterable, fixed, collectible visual image of staged freakishness that penetrated into the Victorian parlor and family album.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Garland Thomson thus describes the freak show as a multimedia spectacle including two verbal components, oral performance and written discourse, and two visual components, the live freak on display and the photographic portrait. I call the verbal components <span style="font-style:italic;">spiel</span>, in order to emphasize the performative character and the play intrinsic to both the impresario’s address and promotional materials such as the “true life” pamphlet.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> The visual components, by contrast, I call <span style="font-style:italic;">tableau</span> in order to emphasize the silence and stasis that traditionally marks the freak performer in his or her live and photographic exhibition.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> All accounts of the aesthetic legacies of the nineteenth-century freak show depend upon the relationship they assert, however implicitly, between spiel and tableau.
      </p>
<p>
	Most often approached from the perspective of sociology or cultural studies, scholarly explorations of the freak show generally have not explicitly taken up the issue of aesthetics, and thus the relationship between spiel and tableau has received only passing attention. A survey of the field, however, reveals that studies almost always subscribe to one of two theories, one premised on an aesthetic of coherence and the other on containment. In his sociology of the freak show, for example, Bogdan contends that the visual presentation of the freak—on the stage or on the <span style="font-style:italic;">carte de visite</span>—confirms the verbal spiel of the lecturer and the “true life” pamphlet: “dressed in a style that was compatible with the story, the exhibit would behave consistently with the front,”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> he maintains.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Bogdan implies that the “story” precedes and dictates the terms of the visual consumption of the freak on display. Moreover, he suggests that the verbal and visual components of the display are allied in the production of a consistent object. The cultural studies collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">Freakery</span> tend to favor a second alternative, one implied in Garland Thomson’s description of the “narratives” of the freak show.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> By naming the four elements of the freak show “narratives” or “discourse,” she suggests that even the visual image and display of the freak were ultimately narrativized and that the containment of the freak’s transgression lies in this narrativization. Both Bogdan’s sociological method and Garland Thomson’s cultural studies approach privilege the narrative elements of freak show display, identifying narrative as that which delimits the signification of the exhibition.
      </p>
<p>
	Yet, as Rachel Adams writes, the narrative components of the freak show did not consistently “give coherence to bodies that otherwise suggested an intolerable fragmentation and dissolution of meaning.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> On the contrary, a study of the extant verbal and visual artifacts of the freak show suggest that, in the name of curiosity and the profits that could be derived from it, freak display often developed as a contest between visual and verbal assertions, between spiel and tableau. In that contest, narrative did not necessarily provide the viewer with the comfort of mastery, resolution, or the confirmation of “a permanent, qualitative difference between normality and deviance.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Rather than comforting certainties, freak show exhibits functioned as provocations to a state of suspense in which the incommensurability of word and image threaten to reveal the authorizing discourses of “the real” and “the true” as radically insufficient. Hence, one of the most popular freak performers of the nineteenth century was William Henry Johnson, a microcephalic African American billed as “Zip, the What is it?” Dressed in a monkey suit, Johnson posed as a “missing link,” and his exhibition exploited questions both about the Darwinian descent of man and the humanity of African Americans that preoccupied his Victorian American audience.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Contrary to the aesthetics of coherence or containment at which Bogdan and Garland Thomson arrive through their respective emphases on narrative, Johnson’s exhibition depended on an aesthetic of indeterminacy arrived at through the competing claims of spiel and tableau.
      </p>
<p>
	In his role as “the missing link,” the exhibition of William Henry Johnson is no exceptional case; alongside the aesthetics of the “coherent front” and “narrative containment” a nascent aesthetic of indeterminacy emerges, one in which the hyperbolic and contradictory art of verbal spiel repeatedly points its audience to a visual tableau that refuses to confirm its claims. The result is desire—epistemological, semiotic, and often, libidinal. These freak show exhibitions are themselves premised on a “missing link” between verbal and visual assertions. So, too, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s freak dandies all the beg the question “What is it?” and, as they do so, specifically reveal the missing links between and within discourses of “the invert” and “the Jew” forged as part and parcel of fascist instrumentalization.
      </p>
<p>
	The narrative presentation of Hedvig and Guido Volkbein that opens the novel demonstrates <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s appropriation of a freak show aesthetic of indeterminacy and the discursive intercourse between the “invert” and the “Jew” that informs the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> novel’s consequent parade of decadent and transgendered freaks. Like Nikka, these freak dandies embody the slippage between racial and sexual discursive registers. Just as Nikka’s performance serves as an immanent critique of Western colonial discourses, the novel’s narrative exhibition of Hedvig and Guido represents an immanent critique of a fascist discourse that would conflate decadence with degeneracy. As a freak show, the novel begins, we can say, with what Robert Bogdan has named the “aggrandized mode” of freak display. As Bogdan explains, “with the aggrandized mode the presentation emphasized how, with the exception of the particular physical, mental, or behavioral condition, the freak was an upstanding, high-status person with talents of a conventional and socially prestigious nature. . . . One, some, or all of the following attributes were fabricated, elevated or exaggerated, and then flaunted: social position, achievements, talents, family, and physiology.”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In its presentation of Hedvig and Guido Volkbein, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> translates the aggrandized mode into a Decadent register. As the characters aggrandize themselves, they create the theatrical sets of their own freak tableau, and their will to Aestheticism becomes the measure of their freakishness.
      </p>
<p>
	Like Nikka, Hedvig and Guido’s enfreakment depends upon a highly stylized Decadence. As the narrator tells us, they live in a home that has become “a fantastic museum of their encounter” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 5), a theatrical set, recalling Des Esseintes’ elaborate hermitage in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Rebours</span>, against which they perform their false aristocracy. Moreover, the narrator describes this theatrical set in the torturous syntax and digressive sentences typical of the decadent novel, as in: “The long rococo halls, giddy with plush and whorled designs in gold, were peopled with Roman fragments, white and dissociated; a runner’s leg, the chilly half-turned head of a matron stricken in the bosom, the blind bold sockets of the eyes given a pupil by every shifting shadow so that what they looked upon was an act of the sun” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 5). In its own “whorled design,” the sentence reproduces the baroque aggrandizement it describes, revealing the practice of a Decadent art of which Guido and Hedvig remain, ironically, unaware. Together with the French windows, Venetian blinds, a “thick dragon’s-blood pile of rugs from Madrid,” and “stuffs from Tunis,” the Volkbein home is a pastiche of “dissociated” historical, national, and aesthetic styles (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 5). Rather than a monument to the “blood and soil” of fascist nationalism, it is a Decadent cabinet of curiosities that monumentalizes nothing so much as the rootlessness it ostensibly veils. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, Decadence thus first emerges as the compensatory aesthetic of the Wandering Jew.
      </p>
<p>
	Against this theatricalized set, the narrator presents Hedvig and Guido in a pair of displays that mirror the portraits of the prevaricated Volkbein ancestors that adorn their study and emphasize the freak show art of tableau. In these portraits, “reproductions of two intrepid and ancient actors,” the res are captured in arrested action: the lady is posed “expecting a bird” and the gentleman is seated on a charger and captured in “the execution of a falling arc” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 6). So, too, the novel opens with Hedvig, captured in tableau:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  Early in 1880, in spite of a well-founded suspicion as to the advisability of perpetuating that race which has the sanction of the Lord and the disapproval of the people, Hedvig  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Volkbein—a Viennese woman of great strength and military beauty, lying upon a canopied bed of a rich spectacular crimson, the valance stamped with the bifurcated wings of the House of Hapsburg, the feather coverlet an envelope of satin on which, in massive and tarnished gold threads, stood the Volkbein arms—gave birth, at the age of forty-five, to an only child, a son, seven days after her physician predicted that she would be taken.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  [<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 1]
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Once again the excess of detail in this description reflects the excess of the decor and adds to the aggrandizement of the social position and lineage of the freak on display. Moreover, Hedvig’s description is clearly an exaggeration of a decadent and disappearing royalty, characterized by its “massive and tarnished gold threads.” In the last gasp of royal privilege, under the “bifurcated wings of the House of Hapsburg,” Hedvig offers her biracial offspring to the disapproving people. Underscoring the tableau quality of the description, the narrator freezes Hedvig in the act of thrusting her child from her “with the gross splendour of a general saluting the flag” (ibid). Thus, Hedvig’s freakishness is twofold; she is at once the aggrandized “Baroness” in an age that has de-legitimated its royalty, and a masculinized re giving birth.
	</p>
<p>
	  Hedvig’s freakishness is constructed around her false title and aggrandized stature, but her physiology is the center of the display. In the narrative spiel that accompanies her tableau, Hedvig is the embodiment of fascist masculinity. She is the possessor of “great strength and military beauty,” as well as a “massive chic” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 4). She even plays the piano “with the masterly stroke of a man in the tempo of her blood” and turns the dance floor into “a tactical maneuver” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 9, 4). If, as Marcus suggests, Hedvig is the re for the Aryan in the novel (“LL,” 230), her place in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is undoubtedly parodic. Not only does the Aryan sacrifice her life to give birth to a half-Jewish child, but the novel’s insistence on her as the embodiment of a masculinity defined by “great strength and military beauty” reveals the privileged fascist subject—the male soldier—as a transgendered woman. In addition to Felix, her half-Jewish son, Hedvig is the narrative progenitor of a host of sexually ambiguous and transgendered freaks, including Frau Mann, Nikka, Matthew O’Connor (who calls himself “The Bearded Lady”) and Robin Vote, “The Missing Link.”
	</p>
<p>
	  Guido’s tableau foregrounds the traffic between gender and race that plays such a central role in the novel. As in the case of Hedvig, the narrator similarly emphasizes Guido’s physical freakishness within a tableau that flaunts his self-aggrandizement, his wealth, and his transgression of pre-established boundaries, but if Hedvig is freakish as a transgressor of the categorical imperatives of gender, Guido’s freakishness comes ostensibly from his transgression of racial boundaries:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    Guido Volkbein, a Jew of Italian descent, had been both a gourmet and a dandy, never appearing in public without the ribbon of some quite unknown distinction tinging his buttonhole with a faint thread. He had been small, rotund, and haughtily timid, his stomache protruding slightly in an upward jutting slope that brought into prominence the buttons of his waistcoat and trousers, marking the exact center of his body with the obstetric line seen on fruits—the inevitable arc produced by heavy rounds of burgundy, schlagsahne, and beer.
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    [<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 1]  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Since, in the contemporary discourse of eugenics and degeneration, “the Christian” and “the Jew” represent racial categories, Guido is guilty of miscegenation, and yet his illicit union is made manifest in a physiological description that confuses his gender. His racial degeneracy is red as feminization. Guido’s body becomes visible as the comic bulging of the buttons on his waistcoat “marking the exact center of his body with the obstetric line seen on fruits.” The obstetric line separates him into symmetrical halves, making visible their unnatural union and, simultaneously emasculates the Jew in terms typical of fascist anti-Semitism. While the military and mannish Hedvig gives birth in the first paragraph of the novel, in the second it is her husband, Guido, who carries the pregnant physique, the “obstetric line” revealing the false lineage of the Volkbeins he has conceived. Guido, like Felix, is “heavy with impermissible blood.”
	    </p>
<p>
	      As their traditional genders are transposed onto one another, Guido and Hedvig remind us not only that degeneration theory produced a feminized Jew, but also, as Dana Seitler writes, “that twentieth century conceptions of sexual degeneracy, promiscuity, and desire surfaced out of a racial and racializing context that shaped and disred the human body according to its logic.”<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Hence, the marriage between Hedvig and Guido preres the discursive intercourse between the queer subject and the Jew in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, an intercourse that not only renders the racial subject a pervert, but also renders the queer subject a “Jew.” In becoming Jew, the queer subject becomes a member of a rootless, degenerate race of miscegenated subjects motivated by monstrous, unnatural appetites. In becoming Jew, in other words, the queer subject becomes Decadent, an ideological stance that, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, produces the subject/object of desire.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In keeping with a freak show aesthetic that is designed to exploit the epistemological stance of indeterminacy, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> accompanies its tableau of the Wandering Jew as a pregnant man with a series of conflicting explanations that work with and against the scientific racism of the 1930s.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> In the spiel surrounding Guido and Felix, Decadence is apparently equated with degeneration, and it is by dint of this equation that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s narrator seems to ventriloquize the contemporary racial discourse of Nazi fascism. As Carlston writes, “Barnes undoubtedly understood what her symbols, particularly the image of the Jew, meant to the (fascist) age.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Regardless of what Barnes did or did not understand, as the Jew is nonetheless submitted to the freak show aesthetic of indeterminacy accomplished in the play between spiel and tableau, he becomes a model not only for otherness as such, but also for the freak dandy’s resistance to rationalization. At different turns and even, at times, in the space of the same sentence, Jewishness becomes a function of biology, an effect of history, and an aesthetic style and subjective stance vis-à-vis the hegemony of bourgeois rationalism.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The instability of the term “Jew” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> ironically manifests itself in its relation to “blood,” for in yoking the two terms together the novel only ostensibly confirms the biologically-based anti-Semitism of Nazi discourse. As it turns out, “blood” is as unstable a signifier in the novel as is “Jew.” Certainly, the assertions that Guido and Felix are “heavy with impermissible blood” and that their counterfeit ancestors are an “alibi for [that] blood” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 7), suggest that Jewishness is inescapably biological, yet the narrator radically complicates this equation directly before introducing the decadent circus freaks with whom the Jew identifies:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		It takes a Christian, standing eternally in the Jew’s salvation, to blame himself and to bring up from that depth charming and fantastic superstitions through which the slowly and tirelessly milling Jew once more becomes “collector” of his own past. His undoing is never profitable until some <span style="font-style:italic;">goy</span> has put it back into such shape that it can again be offered as a “sign.” A Jew’s undoing is never his own, it is God’s; his rehabilitation is never his own, it is a Christian’s. The Christian traffic in retribution has made the Jew’s history a commodity; it is a medium through which he receives, at the necessary moment, the serum of his own past that he may offer it again as his blood.

<p class="continued">
		Both the Christian and the Jew in this passage are ostensibly defined biologically—by their bloodlines. Yet, as the paragraph asserts the commodification of Jewish history, the Jewish subject becomes reliant on a re-collected past, that is, on culture. The confusion between biological determinism and cultural construction is further evident in the final sentence of the passage. Jewish history is here likened to blood metaphorically as the “serum” of the past, but it is manipulated so that the Jew may present this culturally constructed and commodified past as “his blood,” the biological signifier. As a kind of reverse Darwinism, history is passed off as biology.
	      </p>
<p>
		Anti-Semitic and relentlessly essentializing, the narrator’s spiel is filled with assertions, with claims to knowledge and understanding of the aestheticized objects on display. And yet, as in the case of typical freak show spiel, the contradictions and hyperbolic quality of those claims create suspicions. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s spiels exoticize and mystify their objects. Rather than granting the readers an appropriating gaze of the tableaux placed before them, Hedvig and Guido are rendered unassimilable to contemporary sciences of race. Hence, while Carlston sees their resistance to rationalism as an example of the novel’s kinship with fascism, it is, rather, part and parcel of the novel’s immanent critique of degeneration theory as it thrived within and without the fascist state.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>
		The essence of Jewishness for Guido is persecution and humiliation, but the essence of Jewishness for <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is the Aesthetic Decadence through which Guido’s identification is forged. As Lara Trubowitz has emphasized, Guido’s “racial memory” of the ordinance of 1468 which demanded that “with a rope about its neck, Guido’s race should run in the Corso for the amusement of the Christian populace” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 2) is only apparently the key to his interpellation as a Jewish subject.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Rather, the moment of ideological interpellation is offered in a sentence interrupted by a similitude that likens the “racial memory” to Aesthetic Decadence: “this memory and the handkerchief that accompanied it had wrought in Guido (as certain flowers brought to a pitch of florid ecstasy no sooner attain their specific type than they fall into its decay) the sum total of what is the Jew” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 2). As this <span style="font-style:italic;">fleur du mal</span> de-historicizes “the sum total of what is the Jew,” Trubowitz demonstrates, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> transforms the Wandering Jew into a wandering trope. For Trubowitz, it is a trope for the style of the text itself, a mode of storytelling dependent upon self-erasure. While I concur that Jewishness in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> detaches itself from the re of the Jew himself, in my reading the “Wandering Jew” res not as self-erasure but as the “florid” Decadence of the freak dandy, a spectacular subject/object of unrequited desire. For this reason, I affirm Trubowitz’s conclusion  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that “Robin finally is the principal Jew of the novel” .<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Nomadic, voracious, and ultimately unassimilable to the rationalist discourses that would explain her, Robin not only marries a Jew; she becomes more Jewish and more decadent than the Jew from whom she wanders away. If, as Seitler asserts, in Robin “<span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> makes visible a model of sexual personhood that is constitutively homeless, irrational, and perpetually mobile,” it is precisely because she assumes the decadence of the Wandering Jew.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Like Guido, Hedvig, and Nikka, Robin enters the novel in a tableau that emphasizes the artificiality and excess of decadence, along with the showmanship and physical anomaly of the freak show. Yet where the exhibition of Guido and Hedvig partakes of the aggrandized mode of freak display, Robin’s is relentlessly exotic. In the exotic mode, Bogdan tells us, “showmen presented the exhibit so as to appeal to people’s interest in the culturally strange, the primitive, the bestial, the exotic.”<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Unlike the “aggrandized mode,” which invited the audience to identify with the exhibit, the exotic mode emphasized the exhibit’s difference. Recalling Hedvig’s tableau and foreshadowing O’Connor’s, Robin is placed on a bed and in a highly detailed set. In keeping with an exotic mode of freak show display, her head is “surrounded by a confusion of potted plants, exotic palms and cut flowers, faintly oversung by the notes of unseen birds” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 34), all of which aid in the conveyance of Robin’s specific form of freakishness: atavism. In a passage that seductively pairs Decadence with degeneracy, Robin emerges as a romanticized version of an old freak show standard, the “missing link”:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

		  The perfume that her body exhaled was of the quality of the earth-flesh, fungi, which smells of captured dampness and yet is so dry, overcast with the odour of oil of amber, which is an inner malady of the sea, making her seem as if she had invaded a sleep incautious and entire. Her flesh was the texture of plant life, and underneath it one sensed a frame, broad, porous, and sleep-worn, as if sleep were a decay fishing her beneath the visible surface. About her head there was an effulgence as of phosphorous glowing about the circumference of a body of water—as if her life lay through her in ungainly luminous deteriorations—the troubling structure of the born somnambule, who lives in two worlds—meet of child and desperado.

<p class="continued">
		  Like the “florid ecstasy” of the flower that turns immediately from effulgence to decay, the “phosphorous glowing” around Robin’s head is a function of “luminous deteriorations,” and hence, like the Jew, Robin res both degeneration and Aesthetic Decadence. Moreover, like Felix, Robin embodies the transgression of racial boundaries such that her very humanity is questionable. She is not only the “meet of child and desperado”; she is also an evolutionary throwback to the momentary hybridity of plant life and animal life and, finally, as the “beast turning human” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 37), to the convergence of animal and human life forms. Robin is atavistic, uncanny, the insinuation of the archaic and pre-historic in the twentieth century. Because the throwback has historically threatened the reversal of human development, Robin is a re for degeneration and devolution. Only apparently anomaly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">frisson</span> of the “missing link” lies in the possibility that evolution at any time may reverse its course. Robin is “the infected carrier of the past” who attracts by soliciting the desire for consumption:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> “before her the structure of our head and jaws ache—we feel that we could eat her” and in so doing, gain access to the archaic past, to press, as the narrator puts it, “our face close to the blood on the lips of our forefathers” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 37). Robin’s degeneration is our Decadent seduction.
		</p>
<p>
		  Yet between the two extended passages that lyrically introduce Robin as the conflation of the Decadent with the degenerate, a freak show aesthetic of indeterminacy intervenes. It is, as we have already seen in the novel’s treatment of the “Wandering Jew,” an aesthetic that provokes and prolongs desire through the contest it stages between the verbal art of spiel and the visual art of tableau, and its result is curiosity, desire held in suspense. It is an aesthetic that simultaneously renders the human curiosity indeterminate and, at the same time, reveals its identification with the commodity fetish. Without this aesthetic intervention, it might be possible to conclude, along with Carlston, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence reveals its alliance with fascism, for tasting the blood on the “lips of our forefathers” sounds a great deal like the fascist fantasy of immediate fusion with a primitive past. The revival of the archaic past for fascism, however, was marshaled in the name of regeneration, not degeneration. At least in the eugenic version of fascism promulgated by the Nazis, the degenerate and the Decadent were embodied most forcefully in the re of the Jew, whose elimination was the guarantee against racial decay. Thus, if <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> conveys a desire for an archaic past similar to that of fascism, it does so for utterly different reasons. In the spiel surrounding Robin, the desire is for regression, not regeneration. Moreover, the extended spiel is interrupted by allusions to freak show conventions that undermine the romance with regression so hyperbolically voiced by the narrator.
		</p>
<p>
		  More than either the exhibition of Hedvig or Guido, Robin’s tableau emphasizes the artificiality and theatricality of her display, playing havoc with the lyrically-tuned assertions of the “missing link” spiel:

		    In this tableau, the evolutionary discourse and degeneration theory exploited by the narrative to construct Robin as atavistic are both revealed as accoutrements to a public performance designed for mass consumption. Her stage, promoter, sound track, and the artificiality of the “jungle trapped in the drawing room,” all emphasize the freak show sleight of hand, the constructedness of the freak on display. Rather than the embodiment of the archaic, pre-historic, and pre-human past, Robin represents the desire for that past, the fantasy of regression, that experience of the uncanny exploited by Rousseau, the avant-garde, and fascism alike. Here it is demystified as the canny art of show business, the decadent commitment to artificiality put in the service of “the society of the spectacle.” If Robin is “thrown in among the carnivorous flowers as their ration,” it is part and parcel of a spectacular exhibition aimed at producing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> curiosity as an object and as an epistemological stance, aimed, that is, against fascist instrumentalization.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Underscoring the demystification of Robin as a freak of nature, the text offers Robin’s exhibition as the site of O’Connor’s double hoax. “Half dompteur” and “half promoter,” he awakens the “sleeping beauty” by throwing water on her face, passing himself off as a doctor all the while (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 35). Second, he “prepares his audience for a miracle” that they entirely miss. While adorning his face with Robin’s makeup, he distracts the audience with a series of “honesties” and “reache[s] out and cover[s] a loose hundred franc note lying on the table” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 36). Robin’s exhibit, then, is a performance space for the hoax of authenticity, a site in which Aesthetic Decadence joins hands with degeneration theory in the production of a myth as fantastical as the unicorn or Sleeping Beauty. If Robin references the fascist goal of fusion with an archaic past, then <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> conveys that ideology as a popular myth passed off as science by a charlatan scam artist after a quick buck, or, as it were, “a hundred franc note lying on the table.” As the narrator makes clear two pages later when she asserts that “we feel we could eat her,” the carnivorous flowers reflect the voracious desires of the viewers themselves, desires to consume, to incorporate, to make Robin their own. Such, of course, is the desire of Felix, Nora, and Jenny, and it is through their attempts to rationalize—and thus possess—Robin that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> conveys a fascistic impulse detached from the fascist state.
		  </p>
<p>
		    As its protection against the threat of incorporation, competing explanations of Robin vie against one another in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, thanks largely to the strategic and protracted interventions of O’Connor, contradicting one another and casting each other into doubt. Originally exhibited as a “missing link,” Robin’s racial ambiguity in the first set of tableaux emerges as a function of her sexual ambiguity, her queerness. In addition to the science of degeneration that attends her earliest display, the discourses of contemporary sexology and Freudian psychoanalysis attempt, as O’Connor charges, “to dress the unknowable in the garments of the known” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 136). Playing the contrary assertions of these discourses against one another, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> ultimately refuses to explain Robin or her desires, and instead offers an immanent critique of bourgeois rationalism and its instrumental subject. As a Wandering Jew, Robin evades the grasp of those who would claim her and persists, to the end, as a freak dandy, a decadent subject/object of unrequited desire.
		  </p>
<p>
		    While critics have often identified O’Connor as the authoritative voice of the novel, a closer look at the context of O’Connor’s claims about Robin reveals the strategic ways he marshals degeneration theory and psychoanalysis against the claims of the two characters whose libidinal and epistemological desires are most dangerously directed at Robin: Nora Flood and Felix Volkbein. That is, rather than defining Robin, O’Connor’s hyperbolic assertions and elusive digressions work to un-fix Robin from the appropriations of Nora and Felix. O’Connor’s construction of her as a “missing link” thus represents not the novel’s commitment to fascist ideology or degeneration theory, but, rather, his effort to render Robin indeterminate and, hence, free. Thus, in the chapter entitled “Where the Tree Falls,” when faced with Felix’s own exotic portrayal of Robin’s uncanny embodiment of the archaic past, O’Connor responds with  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the parable of “the horse who knew too much” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 113), materializing Robin’s elusive affect as a function of wartime trauma.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Only when Nora presents her love for Robin, and lesbian desire as such, as narcissism, does O’Connor exoticize Robin in terms that reproduce her initial display, as “outside the ‘human type’—a wild thing caught in a woman’s skin, monstrously alone, monstrously vain; like the paralyzed man in Coney Island . . .” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 146). Degeneration theory becomes a strategic mystification marshaled against the rationalization of psychoanalysis.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Although Nora confesses that she has “dressed the unknowable in the garments of the known” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 136), her confession does not stop her from continuing to discursively devour Robin. Each version of love she develops is a love defined as narcissistic incorporation, a love that destroys subject and object relations and hence allows Nora to “possess” Robin as part of herself. “Robin is incest,” she tells O’Connor, “I can’t live without my heart” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 156). “On her mouth,” she insists, “you kiss your own” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 143), and her final fantasy of eternal love is for the two of them to have “moulted our parts, as res in the waxworks are moulted down to their story” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 158). Within this context, O’Connor’s insistence on Robin’s otherness, her monstrosity, represents a counter-discourse both to the violence implicit in Nora’s account of love and to Freudian accounts of homosexual desire as a pathological manifestation of narcissism.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Yet, O’Connor himself turns to Freud in “Go Down, Moses,” the very same chapter in which he portrays Robin as an uncanny beast-turning-human. For those with samesex desire, O’Connor turns to the language of the “invert” and “the third sex,” terms he manipulates, like the evolutionary discourse of degeneration theory, to counter Nora’s account of same-sex desire. It is precisely when Nora characterizes same-sex desire as a will to power that O’Connor turns to his fairytale account of “this love we have for the invert” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 136). “And I, who want power,” Nora temporarily concludes, “chose a girl who resembles a boy,” a pathological explanation to which the doctor responds by asserting the essential and natural bisexuality of the child: “for in the girl it is the prince, and in the boy it is the girl that makes a prince a prince—and not a man” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 136). In the context of the conversation, O’Connor’s use of a Freudian vocabulary bespeaks neither his nor the novel’s conviction in psychoanalytic constructions of inversion so much as his efforts to counter Nora’s instrumental logic and thus to repair Robin and the same-sex desire she embodies to the realm of uncertainty.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“A Fixed Dismay”</h1>
<p>
		    It is precisely because Robin is the subject/object of desire that she can and must remain disowned. In the pages of “The Possessed,” the novel’s final chapter, Decadence and degeneration apparently join hands to present a scene of gothic devolution. Robin wanders through the countryside and into churches, eventually arriving, as if drawn by supernatural forces, to the “decaying chapel” on the grounds of Nora’s farmhouse. There she arranges a “contrived altar,” placing flowers and toys before a Madonna and two candles. On the fateful night that closes the novel, Nora’s agitated dog leads Nora to the chapel door. Nora “plunges into the jamb” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 169), but as if from her point of view, the narrator reports:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

		      Standing before them in her boy’s trousers was Robin. Her pose, startled and broken, was caught at the point where her hand had reached almost to the shoulder, and at the moment Nora’s body struck the wood, Robin began going down. Sliding down she went; down, her hair swinging, her arms held out, and the dog stood there, rearing back, his forelegs slanting; his paws trembling under the trembling of his rump, his hackle standing; his mouth open, his tongue slung sideways over his sharp bright teeth; whining and waiting. And down she went, until her head swung against his; on all fours now, dragging her knees. The veins stood out in her neck, under her ears, swelled in her arms, and wide and throbbing rose up on her fingers as she moved forward.

<p class="continued">
		      Here, the beast-turning-human apparently makes good on its threat to reverse course; Robin seems to become a beast, and according to some critics, engages sexually with the dog she terrorizes. Down on all fours, she is the fantasy of sexual personhood beyond the reach of psychoanalysis and sexology, an obscene wish fulfillment that is also, at the same time, the brutal fantasy of return to an archaic past or to the imaginary realm of the mother. Equally brutal, however, the novel indicates its own awareness of the scene as a desperate fantasy. “Grinning and whimpering” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 170), Robin doesn’t turn into a dog; she <span style="font-style:italic;">acts like a dog</span>, and it is a performance that she cannot sustain. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, there will be no escape, no romantic return to nature, no feminist return to the mother or fascist return to the archaic past, not even a decadent return to the aestheticized cloister of the Catholic Church. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, there is no refuge, no place outside of the symbolic order of the “society of the spectacle,” and the only place from which to resist rationalization is from within that society. It is thus not surprising, then, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> ends with a scene that tempts the reader to turn to the very discourses of rationalization thwarted in the preceding chapters as a basis for interpretation: psychoanalysis and degeneration theory. “Lying out, her hands beside her” and the dog’s head “flat along her knees” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 170), Robin is a study in stylized irresolution; her indeterminacy is her saving grace, that which allows her to remain dis-possessed.
		    </p>
<p>
		      As freak dandy, Robin solicits epistemological and libidinal desire, desire that, I have argued, remains unrequited to the end. For from the moment she is introduced, Robin functions as the absent center of a narrative devoted to the failed efforts of its characters to explain her, to claim her by way of asserting an understanding of her desires and the desires she provokes. Against eugenic and psychosexual discourses that would fix the subject, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> offers a decadent freak show that moves toward a state of “fixed dismay” (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>, 157), reproducing in verbal form the “stylized irresolution” emblematized in the work of Aubrey Beardsley and representative of the Decadent art of the “Yellow Nineties.”
		    </p>
<p>
		      At the same time, Barnes’ neo-Decadent novel critically transforms that earlier aesthetic by explicitly identifying its privileged subject, the dandy, with the commodity fetish. In so doing, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> suggests that the aesthetic autonomy and the aesthetic individualism associated with Decadence at the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> are illusory conceits no longer possible in the context of contemporary liberal capitalism. Precisely because <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> takes “the society of the spectacle” as the ontological condition of subjectivity, it regards aesthetic autonomy as warily as the fascism that would absorb Decadence into degeneration theory. Rather than asserting aesthetic autonomy, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s immanent  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> critique works toward a state of doubt and uncertainty, a decadent state of arrested desire. And in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> it is the privileged state of resistance to instrumental reason and <span style="font-style:italic;">embourgeoisment</span>, the only place, as it were, left to go.

			  I am contesting a commonplace in the criticism contending that Barnes outgrows Decadence by the time she writes <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>. See especially Carolyn Burke’s “‘Accidental Aloofness’: Barnes, Loy, and Modernism” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Silence and Power: A Reevaluation of Djuna Barnes</span>, ed.

Shari Benstock (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986), 230–267. Burke is perhaps the most insistent on this point. She suggests that Barnes published the Beardsley-esque verbal and visual images of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Book of Repulsive Women</span> “as if it were necessary to kill off the old images of women before a different vision might become possible” . As Erin Carlston aptly concludes, the problem with Decadence for Burke, as for Benstock, is what they perceive to be its “internalized misogyny and homophobia.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Thinking Fascism: Sapphic Modernism and Fascist Modernity</span> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), 49). I contend, along with Carlston, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> exemplifies the extent to which Decadence continued to inform Barnes’ art, and that to the extent that its art is no longer misogynist or homophobic, it bespeaks a revision of Decadent Aesthetics, rather than an outright rejection of them.

			Just as fascism developed without uniformity in the many countries in which it traveled, so, too, did the culture industry evolve variously. It was not until the postwar period, for example, that French Marxists like Guy Debord and Henri Lefebvre responded against the rapid socioeconomic changes they identified with “Americanization” and its culture industry. On the other hand, even under Nazi control, Germany could boast a lively culture industry that the Nazis used to foster the illusion of individual and cultural autonomy. As Lutz Koepnick writes, “unlike the homogenizing rituals of the Nuremberg rally grounds, the commodity spectacles of Nazi mass culture entertained the individual with the utopian illusion that certain spaces remained beyond control, beyond politics, beyond the effects of coordination.” “Fascist Aesthetics Revisited,” <span style="font-style:italic;"></span> 6, no. 1 : 52. My point is that in the 1930s, avant-garde modernists necessarily and simultaneously confronted fascism and the culture industry as inescapable threats equally capable of instrumentalization.

In other words, until Marcus came along, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> had been celebrated as an illustration of an apolitical “high modernist decadence” (ibid.). In arguing that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> is actually a protest against “sexual and political fascists” (“LL,” 221), Marcus not only makes a compelling case, but opens the door to serious study of the political implications of the text.

			  Writers like Susan Stewart and Mary Russo have demonstrated that the freak show is antithetical to the carnival in precisely the same way that spectacle is to Bakhtin’s carnivalesque novel: the freak show relies on the distance and distinction between actors and spectators that the carnival so aggressively denies. Stewart draws this distinction succinctly: “While the grotesque body of carnival engages in this structure of democratic reciprocity, the spectacle of the grotesque involves a distancing of the object and a corresponding ‘aestheticization’ of it. . . . On display, the freak represents the naming of the frontier and the assurance that the wilderness, the outside, is now territory.” <span style="font-style:italic;">On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection</span> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> University Press, 1993), 107, 110. Unlike the carnival, it is not laughter that overcomes terror in the freak show, but the distance imposed by spectacle, negotiated in the interaction of the barker’s spiel with the freak’s tableau.

			My approach here follows closely that of Diane Chisholm, who sees the novel as a “final front against rationalization and <span style="font-style:italic;">embourgeoisment</span>” (OM, 195), but identifies its aesthetic not with Decadence, but with the “profane illumination” Walter Benjamin attributes to surrealism. “Obscene Modernism: Eros Noir and the Profane Illumination of Djuna Barnes” in <span style="font-style:italic;">American Literature</span> 69, no. 1 (March 1997): 167–206. I would contend that if the novel’s celebration of the détraqué and his “intoxication with all the processes of degradation” are part of its surrealism, then they point as well to surrealism’s debt to Decadence. Chisholm, “Obscene Modernism,” 189. The same is true for the works of the Marquis de Sade that Robin “sleeps with” , according to Chisholm, and which were revived not only by the surrealists but by the Decadents of the 1890s.

			Invaluable for its insistence on <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>’s Decadence, Carlston’s study overlooks the fact that fascism and the neo-Decadence of the 1930s are both informed by the larger historical context of modernity, and that context in large part explains their common ground. Moreover, Carlston’s conclusions seem to miss the extent to which <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> critiques what her study takes to be the most important commonality between fascism and <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, its characters’ fantasies of immediacy and fusion. “The Learned Corruption of Language” thus stumbles as it tries to negotiate its recognition that immediacy and escape from the symbolic order are utterly undermined by the style of the novel, which luxuriates in the semiotic thrall so typical of the decadent text. As Carlston concedes, “Barnes’ language, in defiance of the central aesthetic principle of fascism, has ‘ceased to be organic.’ Her artifice, that antagonism to ‘Nature’ which makes her so inimical to Marxist criticism, is, equally, a rejection of the fascist literary ideal of mimesis” . Carlston is thus forced into separating the text’s ideological implications from its aesthetic such that it becomes impossible to say that decadence is the precondition of fascism. Her compromise is to make the novel’s “flirtation” with fascism a failure. The romance ends on aesthetic grounds; ideologically, they can still be friends.

To my mind, there is no re that more explicitly embodies the integration of “art” and “life” than the dandy and, as I demonstrate in the following pages, that integration represents a critical praxis, a resistance to bourgeois rationalism and its repressive institutions.

			  Tracing Decadence back to Romanticism, Lukács sees it as a symptom of liberal capitalism that reaches a twin apotheosis in bourgeois modernism and in fascism, for, in Lukács’ eyes, fascism is the logical end of capitalism. Lukács suggests that if Decadent literature does not exactly produce a fascist ideology, it does “cultivate feelings” and “awaken instincts” vulnerable to fascist seduction. “Marx and the Problem of Ideological Decay,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Essays on Realism</span>, trans. David Fernbach, ed. Rodney Livingstone (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1980), 131. However unwittingly, decadent literature implicitly offers the model of subjectivity to the petty bourgeoisie that fascism would so effectively exploit. If literary Decadence is the precondition of fascism, then Felix’s father, the decadent Jewish  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> dandy who aesthetically produces a false past for his son to worship, unwittingly and ironically prepares the sentimental ground for his progeny’s seduction to fascism.
			
			  Whereas Lukács largely charges Decadent literature with a sentimental education for fascism, Benjamin suggests that in its attempt to make an art of life, Aestheticism lays the ground for the aestheticization of politics and, as Andrew Hewitt maintains, the “aesthetic in which politics is aestheticized is assumed to be decadent and reactionary.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Modernism: Aesthetics, Politics, and the Avant-Garde</span> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1993), 24. Thus, it is not simply that in Felix’s Decadence lies the will to aestheticization that fascism will take to its logical conclusion. Rather, in Felix, the aura of autonomous art has already transferred to politics and with it, what Russell Berman calls the “modes of behavior—silence, inaction, submission”—that Benjamin identifies with the auratic work of art. See Berman, “The Aestheticization of Politics: Walter Benjamin on Fascism and the Avant-garde,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Culture and Critical Theory: Art, Politics, and the Legacy of the Frankfurt School</span> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), 38. In Felix, Decadence has already aestheticized politics; Felix worships royalty for royalty’s sake.

			In her celebration of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> as an antifascist call to freedom, Marcus contends that the novel’s “antifascism is apparent only when it triumphs over its own anti-Semitism, when we realize that its characters—Jews, homosexuals, lesbians, transvestites, gypsies, blacks, and circus performers—were all to perish in the Holocaust” (“LL,” 229). In other words, for Marcus, the first chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, which features the strongest anti-Semitic language, is anomalous and naïve, a fact that the rest of the text evinces as it includes the Jew in the sisterhood and brotherhood of outsiders it celebrates as the other of fascism.

			  Critics have interpreted differently the conflicting constructions of the Jew. For example, while Karen Kaviola sees them as part and parcel of the narrative’s ambivalence toward fascist ideology and discourse, Seitler argues that they register the extent to which <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> exploits “the polysemic renditions within degeneration theory”  or, in other words, that it plays with the contemporary instability of degeneration theory. See Kaviola, <span style="font-style:italic;">All Contraries Confounded: The Lyrical Fiction of Virginia Woolf, Djuna Barnes, and Maguerite Duras</span> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991), 69–72, and Seitler, “Down on All Fours,” 525–562.

			Here my argument both parallels and diverges from Seitler’s. She argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> “play[s] with the uncertainties of scientific doctrine” and thereby “willfully reimagines the terms of sexual inversion at the same time that it redeploys them in yet another drama of degeneration.” “Down on All Fours,” 545. While “scientific doctrine” regarding sexual inversion in 1936 may well be uncertain and unresolved, the same cannot really be said of the racial degenerate.
