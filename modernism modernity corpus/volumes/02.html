There were, as nearly everybody knows by now, two

Kurt Weills . . . . The first Weill, it has been

said, wrote "authentic" works with a claim on the

art music world; the second "sold out" for popular

success.

<p>
In September 1942, Kurt Weill reported to Lotte Lenya on his
six-hour
meeting
with Marlene Dietrich, during which he had tried to persuade
her to play
the
title role in <I>One Touch of Venus: </I>"Marlene liked the
music, but
started
that old business about the different quality of my music
here in America.
I cut
it short by saying, 'Never mind those old German songs. --We're in
America now and Broadway is tougher than the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm.'
That stopped her."
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
But it hasn't stopped others. In the
subsequent
five decades, that familiar theme, the "different quality"
of Weill's
American
music, has become evermore an evergreen, subject to
countless variations,
most of
which have deftly shifted accentuation from <I>"different
</I>quality" to
"different <I>quality." </I>Meanwhile, posthumous
professional productions
of
Weill's American stage works have been infrequent and access
to them at
best only
partial (through vocal scores and recordings) and at worst
entirely
misrepresentative (through film adaptations). The perceived
stylistic and
qualitative differences between Weill's American and
European
music--already "old
business" in 1942--have become so pronounced that today it
is commonplace
to
speak of "two Weills." 

<B></B>

<p>
This critical construct has even been institutionalized in
<I>The New Grove
Dictionary of Music and Musicians, </I>where the final
section of David
Drew's
Weill entry is actually entitled "The Two Weills." Drew
asserts that
"while some
notable artists have simply stopped creating at a certain
stage in their
careers
and a few have put an end to their lives, Weill is perhaps
the only one to
have
done away with his old creative self in order to make way
for a new one .
. . .
With <I>Lady in the Dark </I>a new Weill was born, to the
horror of the
handful
of old admirers who were waiting for an American
<I>Dreigroschenoper.</I>"
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Drew infers the genuine composer's
suicide from the circumstantial evidence of an alleged sea
change in the
music
Weill composed in America. "This has nothing to do with
normal evolutionary
processes," he explained in 1969. "It is . . . a
psychological and indeed
historical phenomenon for which there is no parallel in
music. It means
that in
Weill we have not one, but two composers. The first and
important one can
and
should be evaluated without reference to the second."
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Today such an opinion cannot be dismissed out of hand as
merely
Eurocentric, for
the "two-Weill" conceit was, in fact, coined in America amid
shadows cast
by the
critical response of French-connected musical modernists to
<I>Lady in the
Dark</I>'s triumphant premiere in January 1941. Weill's
erstwhile admirer
Virgil
Thomson, who five years earlier had claimed in <I>Modern
Music </I>that
"Weill
has almost created style," lamented in the <I>New York
Herald Tribune
</I>that
the &eacute;migr&eacute; composer's effort to master a
distinctively
American and
populist Broadway idiom had failed: "All is monotonous,
heavy, ponderously
German. It reminds one of Berlinese jazz from the early
1920s, of revues
called
'Die Schokoladen Kiddies,' of sentimental ditties called
'Ein kleiner
Slow-Fox
mit Mary.' . . . His music is just as banal as before; but
its banality
expresses
nothing."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Samuel L. M. Barlow, whom Thomson had recommended
to the
editorial staff of <I>Modern Music, </I>echoed Thomson's
views and
invoked, for
possibly the first time, the notion of a "true Weill" in
contrast to the
one who
had composed <I>Lady in the Dark: </I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In this long score, there are not three minutes of the true
Weill. And in
this
new medium, this new life, this new success, the promise has
been buried
under a
branch of expensive but imitation laurel. This is sad, and
no joking
matter.
Something first-rate has gone third-rate, which is a loss
for everyone who
cares
deeply for an art, beyond any prejudice or timeliness or
mode."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Shortly before Weill's death, the distinguished New York
drama critic
Harold
Clurman, one of the founders of the Group Theatre, provided
a
retrospective of
the composer's American career:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Weill's career since <I>Johnny Johnson, </I>despite
excellent work now and
again--always on a high level of craftsmanship--has been an
adaptation
toward an
increasingly facile, I might say, artistically nondescript
goal. The
result has
been--not unnaturally--an ever more conventional musicality,
a decline in
real
quality, and an increase in journalistic praise, as well as
box office
receipts .
. . . There is nothing wrong in adapting oneself to 

<B></B>

 a new
environment, but
one
must adapt oneself upward rather than downward, that is, to
the more
challenging
and difficult as well as to the simpler and safer.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
A year later, in a review of a memorial concert for Weill in
Town Hall,
Virgil
Thomson agreed that the aesthetic shift differentiating the
two Weills had
indeed
coincided with the biographical dislocation at the midpoint
of his career
and
succinctly formulated the indictment: "After Weill came to
live in
America, he
ceased to work as a modernist."
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
As musicology now begins to take the historical measure of
various strains
of
high modernism and deconstruct its mythology, Weill emerges
as a key
re.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Although in the introductory statement to the first
<I>Ferienkurse f&uuml;r internationale neue Musik </I>in
Darmstadt in 1946
Weill
was one of the ten composers mentioned by name for European
post-War
reclamation
(curiously Webern and Berg were not), sustainable interest
in his
post-1933 music
did not outlive him there. Weill himself had well recognized
the
precarious state
of his post-war reputation in Germany and did not
underestimate the
cultural
barriers that would prevent a fair hearing of his American
works. In 1949,
for
example, he discouraged the notion of a German production of
<I>One Touch
of
Venus, </I>his Broadway piece most closely resembling
conventional musical
comedy: "From all I know about the present status of the
German theatres my
impression is that they are in no way equipped to do justice
to a piece
like
<I>Venus, </I>and a bad production would do a lot of harm to
me. My
European
reputation is worth more to me than the very negligible
amount of money I
can
make with this production."
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Weill's misgivings were
confirmed by
Berlin theater critic Friedrich Luft, who marvelled at
Weill's and Lerner's
"vaudeville" <I>Love Life, </I>the "most beautiful and most
powerful
evening of
theater" he had encountered in New York in 1949: "Such a
combination of
music,
lighting, dance, and wit could hardly be produced with such
nonchalant
precision
by us at home, today or in the foreseeable future."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
But those European critics who could know Weill's American
work only by
reputation, popular arrangements of individual songs, or
grossly disred
screen adaptations of his stage works, tended to concur with
Otto
Klemperer's
assessment: "Weill's last pieces I find awful."
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The
vehemence with
which Weill's American work was repudiated in the post-War
European musical
environment is indicative less of its intrinsic value than
of the
challenge it
seemed to pose to prevailing canons and hierarchies.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
For
example,
in the opening line of his obituary of Weill, T. W. Adorno
suggested that
"the
profile of this composer, who died in America, can hardly be
encompassed
by the
concept of a composer at all." Thereby, Adorno implied that
Weill's
individual
works, his total output, and his compositional evolution
lacked the organic
unity, stylistic progression, and internal consistency
expected of a
genuine
composer.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
Adorno, of course, had long been a, if not <I>the, </I>key
re in
Weill-reception, at least in Central Europe. A virtuoso
display of
dialectical
gymnastics had initially allowed him to defend <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper,
</I>and
consequently Brecht and Weill, 

<B></B>

 from
that work's popular
success. Squeezed
into an
almost unmaneuverable space between an idiosyncratic Marxist
world view
and his
modernist dictum that "all good music since 1850 has
renounced
commercialism
altogether," Adorno declared <I>Dreigroschenoper</I>'s
popularity to have
been a
misunderstanding. The music's parodistic surface is so
appealing, he
noted, that
"those who don't observe sharply enough might think it's all
fun" rather
than a
negative example, a warning against "the demonic abyss of
inanity."
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Although themselves assembled from "the debris of old,
atrophied material,"
<I>Dreigroschenoper </I>and <I>Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt
Mahagonny
</I>brilliantly exposed the folly, in Adorno's view, of
attempting to
revive dead
(read tonal) music. But Weill was unwilling to follow the
implicit agenda
that
Adorno was thus setting out for him under the label
"surrealism."
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
After writing an enthusiastic essay about the Berlin
production of the
<I>Mahagonny </I>opera at the Theater am
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, Adorno
predictably
reneged on his commitment to review <I>Der Jasager </I>and
<I>Die
B&uuml;rgschaft, </I>whose path led away from the parts of
<I>Mahagonny
</I>that
had attracted him. Erstwhile praise for the composer he had
constructed was
becoming something of an embarrassment. Weill had left
Brecht behind, and,
with
him, what had been the basis for Adorno's defense. Further
comment would
require
disavowal, as Weill had renounced the values Adorno
considered to be
absolute:
subjective expression's exclusive claim to authenticity, the
historical
necessity
of atonality, and the existence of objective, integral laws
of musical
structure.
In contrast, long before he would arrive in America, Weill
claimed that the
European tradition of autonomous art music had reached its
appointed
historical
end and was thus doomed to extinction.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
In his works composed
after
1925, Weill had tried to break out of New Music's splendid
isolation, to
attract
a non-specialist audience, to dismantle the barricades that
the
"art-for-art's-sake" wing of modernism had erected against
mass culture. He
suggested that an art work must arise from some sort of
social
consciousness.

<p>
By 1940 Adorno and Weill were both in New York. They had
very little, if
any,
direct social or professional contact.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
As Weill was composing
<I>Lady in the Dark, </I>Adorno was writing his Schoenberg
study,
"Schoenberg and
Progress," later to be published as part of his
<I>Philosophie der neuen
Musik
</I>(philosophy of modern music).
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Therein Adorno insists
that "even
the loneliest language of the artist" communicates by
renouncing
communication,
and that this lonely discourse "reveals more about social
tendencies than
does
communicative discourse." In an interview the same year,
Weill
categorically
rejected <I>"Einsamkeit" </I>(loneliness) and once again
affirmed his
commitment
to accessibility over autonomy: "I do not feel that I
compromise my
integrity as
a musician by working for the theater, the radio, the motion
pictures or
any
other medium which can reach the public which wants to
listen to my
music."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
After Adorno moved to Los Angeles in 1941, he corresponded
with Weill only
once,
at Brecht's instigation, concerning a proposed all-Black
production of
<I>The
Threepenny Opera.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<I> </I>Adorno returned to Frankfurt in
1949,
and the occasion of his next public statement on Weill was
the obituary,
which,
although it evinces no firsthand 

<B></B>

knowledge of Weill's stage
works after
<I>Lady
in the Dark, </I>nevertheless dismisses them all as
concessions to the
American
culture industry: "He had tried to write grand opera. The
most pretentious
was
<I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft. </I>But he no doubt realized the
inadequacy of
that."
Then, modelling himself on Cole Porter, "Weill yielded,"
Adorno claimed,
"to the
pressures and enticements of exile, without fully counting
the cost." But
critic
and Schoenberg-biographer H. H. Stuckenschmidt soon did and
tallied the
balance
sheet: Weill's success in America "was dearly bought by loss
of
quality."
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
"Success" is almost an id&eacute;e fixe within the two-Weill
debate, and
it has
already become something of a leitmotif in this discussion.
Although most
modernist critics have tended to date Weill's purported
"sellout" for
popular
success as roughly coinciding with his arrival in America,
his search for
a wider
audience in commercial venues had begun in Berlin. Already
in the cultural
setting of 1928, success and <I>Amerikanismus</I>--and in
Siegfried
Kracauer's
formulation, also "mass ornaments" and <I>neue Sachlichkeit
</I>(new
matter-of-factness)--were widely seen to be linked: "The
content of
Americanism
reaches its peak not in cultural values but in the idea of
success. Work
only
rarely means something for its own sake to Americans . . .
while pure
creativity
in all forms not immediately concerned with success assumes
the status of a
social wallflower."
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
After the worldwide success of <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper, </I>even Hans Heinsheimer, representing
Weill's
publisher,
Universal Edition, expressed concern over Weill's most
recent
"commercialized
artistic activity," the score for Brecht's and Elisabeth
Hauptmann's slight
<I>Amerikanismus-St&uuml;ck, Happy End: </I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
You should and must free yourself once and for all from
Berlin's
commercialized
artistic activity now that the success of your recent works
has given you
complete independence and freedom, not only financially, but
also
artistically. .
. . You must once again create works which can truly endure,
works which
aren't
just created for the moment as accompaniment for plays, but
which follow
the
great path of development I have always perceived in all
your
works.

<p>
Two decades later, having just seen Weill's and Maxwell
Anderson's
anti-apartheid
"musical tragedy" <I>Lost in the Stars, New York Times
</I>music critic
Olin
Downes wrote to the composer to express opinions similar to
Heinsheimer's:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In many respects I think <I>Lost in the Stars </I>is the
best thing you
have done
yet for the theater . . . . But I am still waiting for the
day when you get
exactly the subject which you can treat without the faintest
consideration
of
public taste or expediency of any sort, while in the
meantime you are
constantly
developing a reputation for making it more and more possible
for you to do
exactly what you want to do ultimately.
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In attempting to persuade Weill to abandon the more
"accessible" path and
turn
back onto a "higher," albeit more difficult road, without
regard for an
audience,
both Heinsheimer and Downes seemed unable to perceive or
accept the central
thread linking the two halves of Weill's career. The
composer's responses
to each
of them, 

<B></B>

 though formulated in different
languages and under
drastically
different
circumstances, are remarkably alike in content and even
diction. Weill
wrote to
Heinsheimer:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The fact that my <I>Dreigroschenoper </I>music has been
commercialized
doesn't
speak against it, but for it, and we would be falling back
into our old
mistakes
if we were to deny some music its importance and artistic
value simply
because it
found its way to the masses . . . . I am the only creative
musician who
for years
has worked consistently and uncompromisingly in the face of
opposition
from the
snobs and aesthetes toward the creation of fundamental forms
of a new,
simple,
popular musical theater. Even my least significant music
theater works
during
this time have been written with this sense of
responsibility and have
grown out
of a constant effort to further a development which seems to
me the only
one
possible. Is that commercialized artistic activity?
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
And to Downes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It must be somewhat surprising indeed to find a serious
subject treated in
a form
which (in this country at least) has been used so far only
for a lighter
form of
entertainment. But that was exactly the nature of my
experiment--to do a
"musical
tragedy" for the American theater so that the typical
American audience
(not a
specialized audience) can accept it, and the real success of
the piece to
me is
the fact that the audience did accept it without hesitation,
that they
accepted a
lot of very serious, tragic, quite un-Broadway-ish music of
operatic
dimensions,
together with some songs written in a more familiar style.
Personally I
don't
feel that this represents a compromise.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Weill's expulsion from Germany and subsequent emigration
certainly
complicated
the issue of "success," for theories of assimilation or
resistance in
exile are
closely intertwined with certain aesthetic precepts of
modernism. In
Adorno's
words, "every intellectual in emigration is, without
exception, mutilated
and
does well to acknowledge it to himself, if he wishes to
avoid being cruelly
apprised of it behind the tightly closed doors of his
self-esteem."
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
As might be expected, Weill felt just the opposite. In 1949,
he wrote (in
English) to one of his old friends in Germany:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
My success here (which people usually ascribe to "luck") is
mostly due to
the
fact that I took a very positive and constructive attitude
towards the
American
way of life and the cultural possibilities in this country
of which most
of the
German intellectuals who came here at the same time, were
critical and
doubtful.
I found enormous latent possibilities in my special field,
the musical
theatre .
. . . Of the ten theatre pieces I've written since I came
here, about half
were
successes, the other half failures.

<p>
Success of the collaborative venture of Broadway musical
theater entailed
high
stakes and was unambiguously defined: if a musical play
failed to find an
audience, it disappeared, sometimes after only a single
performance. And
after a
flop in New York, rarely was there the possibility of a
second chance for
revision and restaging that Rossini and Verdi had taken for
granted, or
even
<I>Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny </I>had eventually
managed. The
intertwined processes of creation and production 

<B></B>

 of American
musical
theater
blurred the boundaries between "work" and "event,"
composition and
performance,
with out-of-town previews serving as a lower-stakes
opportunity for the
collaborators to proof the pudding and refine its recipe
before a paying
audience, which on Broadway would function as final arbiter,
an
all-powerful,
democratically constituted collective critic. Predictably
Adorno
considered such
an approach to the creative process a capitulation to
cultural
commercialism:
"Popularity is psychologically calculated down to the last
note for its
effect on
the listener."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Weill disagreed; "It wouldn't be so much fun
if it
weren't so dangerous, so unpredictable," he told Lenya. "It
is safer to
work in
the movies. But how dull, how uninspiring!"
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Whereas "the
enormous
amounts of money involved" in radio, television, and film
forced the
"creative
artist to adapt himself to the requirements of that
industry," in the
theater
"investments are smaller so one is much freer."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
The 1930s were a grim decade for the Broadway musical, and
not just
because of
the Great Depression. Competing with radio and movie
musicals that had
lured away
many of its creative teams and performers, the stage musical
was searching
for
both new form and function. To envision Broadway in 1936 as
"a perfect
place to
develop a musical theater which, in time, will become to
[America] what
opera was
to Europe" required considerable imagination, especially
after the
financial
failure of <I>Porgy and Bess, </I>Weill's misleading
initiation to the
American
musical theater.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
In an essay published in 1937, Weill
appended "in
America" to a title--"The Future of Opera,"--that Schoenberg
had used a
decade
earlier (and Busoni two decades previous), and set out an
ambitious agenda
for a
"music theater which would develop on a new plane fixed by
the conditions
in the
United States." Whereas Schoenberg had insisted that "art
and success have
to
part company," Weill critiqued the moribund European
operatic tradition
that had
lost its way with "an almost diseased passion for musical
originality."
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
He asserted that "it would be much healthier
for an
American musical theater to make certain concessions to
Broadway
showmanship than
to cater to a traditional opera form which is European in
concept and
purpose."
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Adorno scoffed at what he considered to be self-deception:
"Weill talked
as if
concession to the commercial field were no concession, but
only a pure
test of
'skill' which made everything possible even within
standardized
boundaries." Yet,
the substance and manner of Weill's Broadway works (with one
or two
exceptions,
perhaps) virtually guaranteed that they would not be the box
office
successes of
his competitors. As Stephen Hinton has observed, "Weill's
American
works--each
breaking new ground, each laying claim to the status <I>sui
generis</I>--are no
less <I>Urformen </I>than the European."
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Weill's emigration
had
unexpectedly given him the freedom to explore new hybrid
forms of musical
theater
which the state-subsidized theatrical system in Germany had
largely failed
to
accommodate. The composer described his own <I>Linie
</I>from 1927 to
1947, from
the <I>Songspiel Mahagonny </I>through <I>Street Scene,
</I>as continuous,
a
striving toward "a special brand of musical theater" ("CT").

<p>
Most critics, however, have disagreed. Ernst Krenek, in his
essay
"America's
Influence On Its Emigre Composers," included Weill among
those colleagues
who
took "great pains, against their better judgment, to
cultivate modes of
writing
conditioned 

<B></B>

 by their surroundings" and
"whose American works
point up new
characteristics unknown to their earlier works." Weill, with
his
"irrepressible
urge to communicate via the musical theater," Krenek
observed, "adapted
this
communication to the only vehicle at his disposal, namely
the Broadway
stage."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Adorno was less empathetic: "He could no longer do
what he
knew how to do. He had to renounce all those elements in his
musical
language
which once had created a Weillian atmosphere."
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Decades
later, even
the composer's staunchest champion positioned one Weill at
the greatest
possible
distance from the other: "In all principles--of composition,
of direction,
of
character--everything Weill wrote in America is

from the
way that was Weill's in Europe."

<p>
But is it? By what criteria? Aesthetic, technical,
sociological,
dramaturgical,
or ideological? This represents the central question in
Weill scholarship
today,
and it impinges upon many wider issues about the nature,
function, and
reception
of music in the twentieth century. In addressing it, we are
immediately
thrust
into an ongoing postmodern debate where contextualists and
relativists
battle
against culture-specific assumptions, which have long
purported themselves
to be
universals. If, as Weill consistently maintained in private
and public,
all his
works were stepping stones along the same path toward an
accessible modern
musical theater, that accessibility demanded that he take
into account his
audience, his "reader." "Being a theatrical composer," he
believed, "I
have to
present my music in a manner which would be accepted by a
realistic
public."
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Therefore, as his public changed, from Berlin to
Paris to
London to New York, his manner would also have to change. It
is in this
sense
that Harold Clurman's description of Weill as a musical
Gulliver,
"characteristically twentieth-century" in his adaptability,
gains meaning:
"He
could write music in any country so that it would seem as if
he were a
native. If
he had landed among the Hottentots, he would have become the
outstanding
Hottentot composer of the Hottentot theater. Weill was all
theater and all
'mask.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
If, in Weill's case, style is defined as neither
"idea"
nor <I>the </I>immutable essence that encodes its composer's
identity, but
as
<I>a </I>manner in which he chooses to communicate a
particular musical
thought,
then his style indeed changed. But not once, in America, but
rather, again
and
again. That this stylistic diversity does not follow a
linear biographical
progression becomes obvious in a sample of works composed
almost
simultaneously
in France in 1933-34: the second symphony, the biblical
spectacle <I>Der
Weg der
Verheissung, </I>the satirical operetta <I>Der Kuhhandel,
</I>the
quintessentially French incidental score for <I>Marie
galante, </I>as well
as
cabaret songs for Marlene Dietrich and chansons for Lys
Gauty. The variety
here--of composition, direction, character--would seem to
exceed that
between
<I>Die Dreigroschenoper </I>and <I>Love Life </I>or between
<I>Der
Silbersee
</I>and <I>Street Scene. </I>

<p>
Rather than attempting to sort and classify Weill's various
stylistic
masks as
either "European" or "American" in origin and design, it may
be instructive
instead to identify 

<B></B>

 those features
which remained invariable
throughout his
career. "I need poetry to set my imagination in motion, for
my imagination
is not
a bird but an airplane," Weill had admitted to his sister in
1919, the
year he
determined "that his special field of activity would be the
theater."
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Thirty years later he proudly observed:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
One of the first decisions I made was to get the leading
dramatists of my
time
interested in the problems of the musical theater . . . .
The list of my
collaborators reads like a good selection of contemporary
playwrights from
different countries.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In private, however, he continually lamented how big a role
he always had
to play
in writing a libretto and how difficult it was to find a
qualified
librettist. In
New York, Weill avoided working with the practitioners of
formulaic musical
comedy; his distinguished list of near-collaborators
included such unlikely
librettists as John Steinbeck, Thornton Wilder, Herman Wouk,
William
Saroyan, and
Tennessee Williams. And the failure of Weill's and Brecht's
attempt to
renew
their partnership in the mid-forties for musical versions of
<I>Schweyk
</I>and
<I>Sezuan </I>must be imputed largely to Brecht's refusal to
deal with the
realities of the American producing system rather than any
artistic or
political
reticence on Weill's part. When Weill joined the Playwrights
Producing
Company so
that "things [could be] handled with more courage and
imagination"
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
than could be expected from most commercial producers, he
found little
altered
from the modus operandi of the Brecht or Piscator
collectives in Berlin,
except,
as Weill told Adorno, that "there exist certain rules of
'fair play' in the
American Theatre."
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>

<p>
Weill's working methods were at odds with the Broadway norm
in other ways,
as
well. For example, his collaboration with Ira Gershwin was
initially
problematic,
because Ira was accustomed to fitting lyrics to George's
preexistent
tunes, the
usual procedure for popular songwriting teams. Weill, on the
other hand,
found it
virtually impossible to compose without a text in hand. As a
compromise,
at first
they worked in the same room, creating text and music almost
simultaneously;
later Gershwin would give Weill a quatrain to set before
writing the
remainder of
the lyric. Weill also insisted on orchestrating the bulk of
his own
Broadway
music, something few others after Victor Herbert have
attempted, either
because
they lacked the requisite expertise or the production
schedule imposed
deadlines
that could be met without heroic efforts only by a team of
orchestrators
and
copyists. Willingly turning over to specialists just a very
few "hot" jazz
or
dance numbers with which he was uncomfortable, Weill often
wrote full
score as he
watched rehearsals and stayed up all night during tryouts to
accommodate
new
material and changes. Because orchestration was such a key
stage in his
compositional process, he risked his health rather than
compromise this
dimension
of his artistic vision. He sought dispensation from union
rules and
agreements
specifying a minimum number of players in order to outfit
each Broadway
work with
its own characteristic orchestral palette and texture.
Therefore, the ad
hoc
mixed ensembles of his American works seldom conformed to
the standard
twenty-odd
piece Broadway pit orchestra of the forties. <I>Street
Scene</I> 

<B></B>

 used the
largest
orchestra, approximately thirty-five; <I>Lost in the Stars,
</I>the
smallest,
only twelve. He considered the latter the most ingenious
orchestral effort
of his
career, and a detailed study of Weill's Broadway
orchestrations would
reveal
subtlety and skill unsurpassed in any of his European
scores. But to date
none of
his American theater works has been published in orchestral
score, and
they have
seldom been heard. Only two have been recorded in their
entirety; and
Weill's
instrumentation rarely survived in the well-known pop song
versions and
film
adaptations of his stage works.

<p>
Weill finished no independent instrumental compositions in
America. After
the
opening of <I>Lady in the Dark, </I>he reported to Ira
Gershwin, "I've
written
some orchester [sic] music, but I threw it away. It seems so
silly just to
write
music at a time like this."
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
His attitude was consistent with
his
lifelong desire to write "committed" music that would have
demonstrable
impact on
the culture and society for which it was intended. To
appreciate the
historical
and sociological context for his work, one must recall that
the African
American
lyricist of <I>Street Scene, </I>Langston Hughes, was not
permitted to
stay in
the same hotel as the rest of the company in Philadelphia,
and the tour of
<I>Lost in the Stars </I>was cancelled for the same reason
of enforced
racial
segregation. If Adorno had experienced Weill's American
scores as
performed in
their original Broadway productions, he would not have found
the music
"hard to
distinguish from Cole Porter."
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Rather he would have
encountered
(and surely recognized) familiar Weillian elements:
melodies, harmonic
procedures, formal structures, text-music relationships,
tonal
language--even
movements taken over intact from the European works. The
most obvious
carryovers,
of course, were literal self-borrowings, often resurrecting
material from
pieces
unlikely to be resuscitated as a whole. Something from
<I>Der Kuhhandel
</I>,<I> </I>for example, turns up in virtually every
score prior to
<I>Street Scene </I>(including both <I>Lady in the Dark
</I>and <I>One
Touch of
Venus</I>).
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
A memorable contrafactum from a tenor aria in
<I>Der
Kuhhandel </I>accompanied Maxwell Anderson's lyric "Oh, it's
a long, long
way
from May to September" in <I>Knickerbocker Holiday
</I> and thus was
transformed into Weill's most famous American song. Some
"Salvation Army
material" from <I>Happy End </I> was interpolated into
<I>Johnny
Johnson</I>  and <I>One Touch of Venus</I> ,
without any tinge
of
exoticism. Finding the war music of <I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft
</I> in
the
"Divorce Ballet" of <I>Love Life</I> , however, is
more surprising.

<p>
Sometimes literal quotation of earlier material was
motivated by textual
correspondence. For example, in the <I>Ballad of Magna
Carta</I> ,
as King
John strikes down the Seneschal with his mailed fist, Weill
composed music
virtually identical to the end of the boxing scene in Act II
of
<I>Aufstieg und
Fall der Stadt Mahagonny </I>,<I> </I>when Joe sinks
to the ground
and
Fatty calls it a knockout. By far the lengthiest
self-borrowing is the
instrumental introduction ("Nocturne") to Act II of
<I>Street Scene,
</I>lifted
with only slight modification from the "Nachtszene" of
Weill's incidental
music
for Piscator's 1928 production of Leo Lania's
<I>Konjunktur.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
What is significant about passages such as these is <I>not
</I>that Weill
has
reused music from his European works; self-borrowing, only
rarely intended
to be
heard as allusive, had 

<B></B>

 long red in
his compositional
process: <I>Die
sieben
Tods&uuml;nden </I>appropriated portions of <I>Der
Silbersee, </I>for
example,
and the Second Symphony borrowed material from both <I>Die
B&uuml;rgschaft
</I>and <I>Silbersee. </I>Rather, it is that these passages
could be taken
over
with little or no alteration without seeming "foreign" or
borrowed. They
seldom
needed translation in their new contexts.

<p>
Such occurrences, however, remain only superficial echoes of
specific
passages
from Weill's European music. More telling are deeper
resonances within his
musical language: the treatment of strophic and
verse-refrain structures
(cf.,
for example, the form and function of the 16-measure,
strophic "Moritat vom
Mackie Messer" and "The Saga of Jenny"); characteristically
"Weillian"
harmonic
progressions (cf. the refrain of "Das sch&ouml;ne Kind"
[1917] and the
climax of
Maurrant's Aria from <I>Street Scene </I>[1947]); the
unfolding of
large-scale
double-tonic structural units with explicit non-triadic
cadential
resolutions
(cf. Sonata for Cello and Piano [1920] and "My Ship" from
<I>Lady in the
Dark
</I>[1940]); fifth-generated harmonies and pentatonic
melodies (cf. Mvt.
IV of
<I>Frauentanz </I>[1923] and "What Good Would the Moon Be?"
from<I> Street
Scene</I>); and ubiquitous semitone vacillations between
major and minor
within
melodic and harmonic structures. While such examples put the
lie to
Adorno's
assertion that in America Weill "could no longer do what he
knew how to
do,"
generalizations of any sort are inadequate with respect to
Weill, European
or
American. Unmasking one work reveals little about the
stylistic identity of
another. Each aspires to its own manner and form: in Weill's
words, "each
show of
this type has to create its own style. its own texture, its
own
relationship
between text and music."
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
Thus, even contiguous pieces such as
<I>Street Scene, Down in the Valley, </I>and <I>Love Life
</I>differ from
each
other as fundamentally in "composition, direction, and
character" as they
do from
any European predecessors in Weill's oeuvre.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
For a number of reasons, <I>Street Scene </I>may be the most
compelling
case
study for testing the two-Weill hypothesis.
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
As he was
composing it,
Weill told his brother Hans that "it is without doubt the
most important
piece
I've written since <I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft, </I>and it might
turn out to be
the
best of all my works."
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
Shortly before his death, Weill
affirmed that
appraisal and prophesied that "Seventy-five years from now,
<I>Street Scene
</I>will be remembered as my major work."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
It represented, he
said,
the culmination of two dreams: 1. the dream of "a special
brand of musical
theater that would completely integrate drama and music,
spoken word, song
and
movement," toward which all his previous works had aspired;
2. the dream
of an
American opera on Broadway.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Thus, if Weill privately
acknowledged
any split in his musical personality, in <I>Street Scene
</I>the two
personas met
and merged again. As a self-consciously American
opera--written <I>about
</I>America, intended <I>for </I>America, idiomatically
<I>of
</I>America--there
is no Broadway score of Weill's, before or after, that seems
to David Drew
"so
remote from his European experience."
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
And during the first
three
decades after Weill's death, <I>Street Scene </I>was
virtually the only
Broadway
work 

<B></B>

 by Weill to be produced in
recognizable form in Europe
and thus impact
directly upon the "two-Weill" debate there. Thirty-five
years after its
European
premiere in D&uuml;sseldorf in 1955, release of the first
two complete
recordings
of the opera and subsequent productions in Bielefeld and
Munich--as well
as an
influential co-production with the Houston Grand Opera in
1994 by the
Theater im
Pfalzbau in Ludwigshafen and the Theater des Westens in
Berlin--have
rekindled
the controversy that now seems to center on <I>Street Scene
</I>rather than
<I>Lady in the Dark.</I>

<p>
Weill said that he had first experienced Elmer Rice's 1929
Pultizer
Prize-winning
play <I>Street Scene </I>when it was produced as <I>Die
Stra&szlig;e </I>in
Berlin in 1930.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
He met the playwright in New York during
rehearsals
of <I>Johnny Johnson </I>in 1936 and told him that "he had
thought of it
many
times as a perfect vehicle for a musical play" ("SP"). But
Rice, having
been
approached by a number of other composers, including Deems
Taylor and
William
Schuman, thought it was too early for such a musical
adaptation. After the
end of
the war in 1945, however, it again seemed feasible to
consider producing a
play
about the urban American melting pot, in which outsiders
strove to be
insiders.
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Weill and Maxwell Anderson had already started
work on an
outline of a musical version, when Rice insisted that he
would have to
adapt the
play himself. He did agree to bring in a poet to write the
lyrics, which
were to
have none of what Weill called the slickness of typical
Broadway lyrics,
but
rather would "attempt to lift the everyday language of the
people into a
simple,
unsophisticated poetry" ("SP"). After submitting several
audition drafts,
one of
the leading poets of the Harlem Renaissance, Langston
Hughes, landed the
commission, even though he had never worked in the musical
theater before.
The
subsequent collaboration only barely accommodated the team's
conflicting
agendas.
Rice resisted changes to his veristic play, so that after a
year of work
what
emerged was far closer to <I>Literaturoper </I>than Weill
had originally
hoped.
The first number Weill is known to have composed in January
1946 was,
appropriately, "Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?"
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Rice later described <I>Street Scene </I>as the "most
experimental" play
he ever
attempted, in that the apparent classical unities of time
and place were
overwhelmed by a "multitude of varied and seemingly
irrelevant incidents,"
which
somehow had to be arranged into "a patterned mosaic" whose
construction
would
depend upon "concealed architectonics." Rice recalled:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I was helped by concert-going, as well as picture-gazing. No
musician, I
yet had
some grasp of the structure of symphonic music: the
statement,
restatement, and
development of themes . . . . I had been strongly influenced
by the work
of the
17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain, in most of whose
pictures
there was a
dominant architectural unit; . . . in the foreground were
groups of
res, seen
always in relation to the pervasive structure . . . . I was
excited by the
concept of a large number of diverse individuals whose
behavior and
relationships
were largely conditioned by their accidental common
occupancy of a looming
architectural pile. In keeping with this plastic approach, I
thought of
calling
the play "Landscape with res."

Thus the apartment
building,
modelled on an actual one on West 65th Street, served as a
microcosmic
melting
pot, in which working class characters of diverse ethnic and

experienced, within a single twenty-four-hour period, birth,

<p>
Rice's naturalistic drama now seems a most unlikely source
for a libretto.
Despite Weill's <I>post facto </I>insistence that it was a
"perfect
vehicle for
the sort of popular opera" he wanted to write, he wrote to
his parents
that "it
was the riskiest project" 

<B></B>

 he'd yet
undertaken.
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
Although
foreign to
the naturalism of the play, traditional operatic discourse
could certainly
articulate the principal characters's aspirations, dashed
hopes, and
unfulfilled
dreams. But finding a musical analogue for the "urban
landscape with
res"
represented by the house, the "musicodramatic agent" that
Weill described
as "a
prison for the human spirit," presented more of a challenge:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
As soon as I began to think about the music for <I>Street
Scene </I>I
discovered
that the play lent itself to a great variety of music, just
as the streets
of New
York themselves embrace the music of many lands and many
people. I had an
opportunity to use different forms of musical expression,
from popular
songs to
operatic arias and ensembles, music of mood and dramatic
music, music of
young
love, music of passion and death.
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>

<p>
Thus Weill was inspired to invent an equivalent for the
Melting Pot: he
planned
to precede Sam's arietta, "Lonely House," with a huge
five-section
scene-complex
entitled "A Nation of Nations," which would serve as the
central metaphor
for the
opera's pluralistic subject matter and manner. He instructed
Hughes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
The Melting Pot scene we have worked out somewhat on the
following line: it
should start out with a very funny description of Columbus's
trip by Lippo,
always at the end of stanza interrupted by Olsen's dry
remark "But
Erickson was
first." Then we'll have a number of rather short songs of
the different
nationalities, built on a refrain "if it weren't for the
Irish (Germans,
Negros,
etc.), where would America be?" This would lead into a short
t. Then we
decided, Sam should come in and should give them the Melting
Pot idea, and
this
leads into a big ensemble.

Sam, the shy Jewish intellectual, with palpable
autobiographical resonance
for
both Rice and Weill, would seem, in comparison, an isolated
re, the
genuine
outsider of the play. Standing on the street in front of the
house, Sam
would
then sing a "blues," what Weill called the "theme song" of
the show.
("Funny, you
can be so lonely with all these folks around," the first
verse of its
refrain,
ironically corresponds to Adorno's definition of
Expressionist
"Einsamkeit": "the
loneliness of city dwellers who are totally unaware of each
other.")
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
Eventually the entire "Melting Pot" ensemble had to
be
dropped because of its length (it survives in an incomplete
twenty-page
piano
draft), but the relationship it bore to Sam's arietta was
extrapolated to
all of
Act I. (See <a href=2.1kowalke_2.html> 2</a> for the
Musical Design of <I>Street
Scene.</I>)

<p>
The musical design of Act I corresponds to what Rice called
the "patterned
mosaic" structure of the original play and is also
suggestive of the
res
foregrounded in Lorrain's landscapes.
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
The private drama of
the
Maurrant family is set in relief against a broader musical
backdrop of the
community living in Number 346. After the introductory unit
of the first
four
numbers, successive "I am . . ." musical monologues by each
of the four
principal
characters in the Maurrant drama (Anna, Frank, Sam, and
Rose) alternate
with
pieces of the collective facade, presented by an ensemble
populated by
people
with different dialects and ethnic backgrounds: the "Gossip
Quartet," the
"Ice
Cream Sextet," "Wrapped in a Ribbon," "Wouldn't You 

<B></B>

 [<a name="2" href="2.1kowalke_2.html">re
2</a>] <b>[Begin Page 42]</B>

 Like to Be On
Broadway," and
"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed." In the space of these nine
numbers, the
audience is
confronted with two full-blown arias, a parody of a
nineteenth-century
Italian
opera ensemble, a gloss on the Gossip Trio in d'Albert's
<I>Tiefland,
</I>a charm
song <I>&agrave; la </I>Rodgers and Hammerstein, a seductive
soft-shoe, a
jitterbug, a blues, and a slow fox torch song. Note,
however, that the only
musical numbers to receive overtly operatic generic labels
(arias for the
elder
Maurrants, cavatina and arietta for Rose and Sam) are sung
by the four
principals, and minor mode is reserved almost exclusively
for their use.

<p>
The centripetal force of so many diverse idioms packed into
less than an
hour
might threaten musical coherence, had Weill not counteracted
this stylistic
plurality with an analogue for the symphonic technique Rice
had utilized
to hold
his text together, by which words and images (especially
celestial ones
relating
the moon, stars, and dreams) recur, interact, and evolve
when presented by
various characters at different points in the drama. Despite
its
collage-like
surface, there is no score of Weill more tightly interwoven
motivically and
thematically than <I>Street Scene; </I>this is especially
remarkable given
how
much material from his original conception was ultimately
deleted. He uses
all
manner and scale of musical repetition, development, and
transformation to
unify
seemingly un-unifiable elements: reprise of large sections
of numbers;
refrains
within musical scenes; motivic generation and thematic
reminiscence,
transformation, and development. The resulting integration
of diverse
idioms and
sources within a single distinctive voice and coherent
musical structure
was
virtually unique in the Broadway musical theater of Weill's
time. Many of
the
associative relationships are too subtle and complex to be
diagrammed, but
some
of the most significant large-scale thematic correspondences
are indicated
in a
primitive chart on the right side of <a
href=2.1kowalke_2.html> 2</a>.
(Note also that
the opera
begins and
ends in <I>D</I>, with the minor mode of that key recurring
at key tragic
moments
of the drama.)
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
The cumulative effect of such highly
self-referential construction draws the audience into the
scene and rivets
attention on the domestic drama unfolding within the house.

<p>
Some instances are entirely traditional in technique and
function: a
four-measure
orchestral reprise of "Lonely House" closes Act I to
recapitulate the
central
theme of the drama as Sam is left alone on stage, dwarfed by
the building;
the
orchestra plays the melody associated with Mrs. Maurrant's
words "Somehow
I never
could believe" at the climax of the Choral Lament as she is
carried off on
a
stretcher, never to regain consciousness; the reprise at the
end of the
opera of
the opening number "Ain't It Awful, the Heat" brings the
drama full circle
to
emphasize the ultimate futility of individual human
endeavor; with
characteristic
Weillian irony in the final two-bar cadence of the work the
orchestra
blares the
principal melodic re associated with Mr. Maurrant's "Let
Things Be
Like They
Always Was." The densest web of associative material occurs
in the
underscoring,
which Weill uses not only to reinforce the illusion of
naturalism by
mediating
between what is spoken and what is sung, but also to comment
on the stage
action,
usually from an omniscient authorial point of view--a
familiar technique
in film,
which it in turn had appropriated from opera and operetta.
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
"The results are something like <I>Carmen," </I>Weill said.
"The entire
musical
score thus becomes a form of storytelling."
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
The impetus
toward
"narrativizing" orchestral discourse is apparent at the very
outset of the
opera:
in the verse section of Number 10 "Lonely House" a static,
chromatic
ostinato
re is repeated nineteen times in the bass line; its
laconic surface is
agitated by a secco vertical presentation of a minor second.
When Weill
later
composed the Introduction to Act I, he started the opera
with the first
four
measures of the refrain from "Lonely House," brutally scored
and
symmetrically
harmonized for maximum distortion. Then, over a pentatonic
ostinato
invoking a
cinematic clich&eacute; for a bustling metropolis, the minor
second unfolds
linearly, before stretto entries by the violas and cellos
double the
motion of
the "molto agitato." Thus what Weill called the "theme song"
of the opera
also
generated the principal musical material of its
introduction. Both
elements of
that opening are then recalled at the moment of greatest
tension
immediately
preceding the double murder in Act II.

<p>
Clues to the function or meaning of such<I> intra</I>textual
references are
encoded entirely within <I>Street Scene. </I>But what Weill
termed the
"great
variety of musical idioms" in the score was not intended to
work merely on
a
"phenomenal" level as the vernacular music one might hear
"on a hot summer
evening in New York" ("SP"). (He and Hughes had spent
several evenings
observing
children at play so that the Children's Game at the opening
of Act II
would sound
authentic, and he used an actual school song of the Julia
Richman School
to lead
into "Wrapped in a Ribbon.") Rather, with <I>Street
Scene</I>'s collage of
styles
Weill has constructed a matrix of<I> inter-</I>textual
allusions, as large
and
complex as the<I> intra</I>textual one. They invite
associations with
specific
works, musical idioms, or stylistic conventions external to
<I>Street Scene
</I>and thereby force the audience to pull back from the
proscenium into a
larger
world.

<p>
Weill was thus still doing what he knew how to do:
defamiliarizing the
conventional, distancing musical content from function,
estranging music
from its
text, allowing well-known musical icons to become
particularized within the
unfolding drama at hand. As he had formulated it in 1933,
"Everyone who
knows
something about me knows that a text is merely a starting
point for
me--that
every text I've composed looks entirely different once it's
been filtered
through
my music."
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
At its most blatant, Weill paraphrases the "fate
motive"
from <I>Carmen, </I>as well as the melody associated with
the words "I
Pagliacci," at appropriate points in the stage action,
thereby
foreshadowing the
inevitability of the tragic outcome of the love triangle in
<I>Street Scene
</I>and aligning his everyday characters with their grander
operatic
predecessors. And what Adorno had admired in <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper,
</I>refunctioning old conventions by "transferring the
'estranging effect'
into
the musical realm" ("VA"), is also characteristic of
sections of <I>Street
Scene.
</I>The parodic references to the <I>Rigoletto </I>Quartet
and the
<I>Lucia di
Lammermoor </I>Sextet in <I>Street Scene</I>'s "Ice Cream
Sextet" recall
the
technique of the Handelian Third Dreigroschenfinale. In
furnishing Hughes
with a
blueprint for Nurses' Lullaby in Act II, Weill allows us a
glimpse into the
workshop where its "Brechtian irony" was crafted: 

<B></B>

Whatever we will do with the last scene, I am sure the
nursemaids will be
in, and
they need badly an amusing song. As you remember, it should
be a sort of
waltz
song about the newspaper reports and pictures, using the
whole Daily News
terminology which is typical of fifty million women in
America who are more
interested in murder stories than anything else. If you want
to, the
number could
also talk about their Park Avenue employers, maybe they
could indicate
their wish
that a murder like this should happen to their mistresses.
This part
should be a
regular little waltz chorus, then it would be interrupted by
a little
ditty in a
different rhythm (short lines) where they are scolding the
babies in the
carriages to be quiet . . . I know that this kind of lyric
which should be
gay
and funny and bitter at the same time is not easy to write
and that's why
I am
anxious for you to get started so that we won't get into
trouble.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Whereas epic <I>Verfremdung </I>had relied almost
exclusively on parody and
irony, fifteen years later Weill had at his disposal a
number of different,
sometimes more subtle, metadramatic devices for aesthetic
distancing.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
Precisely because of this subtlety, however,
<I>Street
Scene</I>'s audiences<I> </I>were even more likely than
<I>Die
Dreigroschenoper</I>'s to mistake its surface for its
substance. Invited
rather
than required to adopt a critical stance, the "strong
reader" was
challenged to
decode the musical text while others in the audience could
simply enjoy it
without bother. In many cases Weill's intentions remained
ambiguous,
concealed
behind his proverbial theatrical mask. Intertextual
references could be
recognized and interpreted only if the listener were
equipped to
differentiate
them from the conventional backgrounds from which they
emerged. In this
sense,
the original title I had envisioned for this essay,
<I>"&Ouml;ffentlichkeit als
Stil: </I>Musical Experiences of a European Composer in
America," and the
music
of <I>Street Scene </I>(and most of Weill's other American
works,
especially
<I>Love Life</I>) are comparable: "readers" must apprehend
their
intertextuality
if they wish to place the particular within a larger
universe. To be
understood
fully, my abandoned title would have required not only
familiarity with two
languages but recognition of the titles and content of the
two essays by
Adorno
being troped: <I>"Einsamkeit als Stil" (</I>loneliness as
style), a key
section
from "Schoenberg and Progress," and "Scientific Experiences
of a European
Scholar
in America," Adorno's retrospective on his own years of
"exile" in the
United
States. The incongruities between the title and subtitle
prevent the astute
reader from mistaking Adorno himself for the "European
Composer in
America" whose
stylistic credo was accessibility.

<p>
Those referents would have been as foreign to <I>Street
Scene</I>'s
American
"readership" as many of <I>Street Scene</I>'s were to Adorno
and most of
the
European audience. While he could never have taken at face
value the
treakly
operetta idiom parodied in Polly and Macheath's "Liebeslied"
in <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper, </I>only someone more familiar with the
traditions and
repertory of the American musical theater might be expected
to see
something
standing behind the polyanna sentimentality of "We'll Go
Away Together" or
"Wrapped in a Ribbon." With these pointed allusions to two
generations of
American operetta--Romberg/Kern and Hammerstein and Rodgers
and Hammerstein
respectively--Weill manages both to relish and to critique,
while locating
<I>Street Scene </I>within a larger theatrical environment
and its
inhabitants
within 

<B></B>

 a wider sociological landscape.
In the end, however, meaning of such
intertextuality--even multiple layers of meaning--depends
less on attempts
to
fathom the composer's intentions than on the spectator's
independent
interrogation and interpretation of an often ambiguous text.

<p>
That the most "conventional" and seductive music in
<I>Street Scene</I> is
reserved for its shallowest, least mature characters is
discernible from
the
Musical Design outlined in <a
href=2.1kowalke_2.html> 2</a>.
The items marked by
asterisks are the
only
musical numbers that utilize one of the two standard forms
of American
popular
songs, with the 32-bar refrain or chorus generally
comprising four 8-bar
phrases
in either AABA or ABAB patterns. There are five such songs
in a row in Act
I,
Numbers 9-13, four of which are sung naively or impetuously
by youthful
characters, the fifth seductively by Harry Easter, <I>Street
Scene</I>'s
counterpart to<I> Porgy and Bess</I>'s Sportin' Life. The
two popular song
forms
in Act II, Numbers 18 and 20, frame the great choral lament,
and thus
serve a
double function. The extent to which each of these seven
numbers departs
from or
distorts the 32-bar conventional form indicates the degree
of independence
and
spontaneity of thought expressed by the character who is
singing.

<a name=3 href=2.1kowalke_3.html>
<img align=right hspace=5 height=125

Of the seven, the most conventional in form and content is
"Moon-Faced,
Starry-Eyed," but it invites the closest reading. It first
appears at the
end of
the orchestral introduction to Act I, immediately preceding
"Ain't It
Awful, the
Heat," itself an allusion to "Summertime" in <I>Porgy and
Bess. </I>Just
as that
work's overture had originally dovetailed into Jazzbo
Brown's on-stage
piano
solo, in <I>Street Scene </I>the orchestra drops out two
bars after the
curtain
goes up, leaving an on-stage radio playing a bebop
arrangement of the
first part
of "Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed." Obviously to be interpreted as
an actual
popular
song of the day, it simultaneously fixes the time period of
the opera as
the
forties (as opposed to the original play's twenties) and
draws the
audience into
the setting prior to the first rhythmically spoken lines of
dialogue, when
the
orchestra once again enters and takes control. Seventy-five
minutes later,
the
recklessly youthful Mae Jones and her date Dick McGann each
sing, in the
penultimate number of Act I, a full 32-bar chorus of the
song, interrupted
by
melodrama, i.e. diaglogue with musical underscoring,
particular to their
own
immediate situation. Here "Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed" is
presented as a
popular
song they both know, thereby allowing the audience to
suspend disbelief as
the
characters break into virtuoso jitterbugging which seldom
fails to bring
down the
house (<a href=2.1kowalke_3.html> 3</a>). The lyrics
of the song convert into the
most inane
clich&eacute;s the celestial imagery that had previously
conveyed central
characters's personal visions of the American dream.
<sup><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
Taken at
face
value, the number would indeed have placed Weill in the hit
parade down
Tin Pan
Alley with the popular tunesmiths and jitterbuggers who
symbolized for
Adorno
everything that was mindless and sick about American
culture. But the
musical
moment demands to be "defamiliarized," without assistance
from so blatant a
distancing device as Jack O'Brien provides in <I>Mahagonny
</I>by
proclaiming the
"Maiden's Prayer" to be "die ewige Kunst" (eternal art).

<p>
To make sure that the audience for <I>Street Scene
</I>understood the most
important intertextual reference in the opera, the inside
front and back
covers
of the souvenir 

<B></B>

 program book for the
Broadway production featured decidedly
kitschy photographs of lilac sprigs illustrating two stanzas
of "When
Lilacs Last
in the Dooryard Bloom'd," Walt Whitman's famous elegy in
memory of Abraham
Lincoln, which is recited, but only in small part, by Sam to
Rose at the
climax
of Act I in the 1929 play. Langston Hughes may have been a
Broadway novice
at the
time, but he was widely recognized as the foremost Whitman
disciple of his
generation, going beyond Carl Sandburg to embrace Whitman as
not only
<I>the
</I>American nationalist poet, but also a visionary
"outsider," a champion
of
social justice. During the two years he worked on <I>Street
Scene,
</I>Hughes
edited and introduced two collections of Whitman's poetry
and proposed to a
publisher an anthology of recent Negro and Indian poetry
entitled "Walt
Whitman's
Darker Brothers." In his introduction to the Whitman
collection published
by
Young World Books, Hughes articulated what might be
construed as the
principal
theme of <I>Street Scene: </I>"Singing the greatness of the
individual,
Whitman
also sings the greatness of unity, cooperation, and
understanding."
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
Soon after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941,
Weill, too, had
turned
to a volume of Whitman's <I>Leaves of Grass, </I>which Paul
Green had
given him
in 1938. Weill 

<B></B>

 marked a number of poems
from the Civil War collection
<I>Drum
Taps, </I>set three of them as songs for voice and piano,
and then
orchestrated
them for a recording that never materialized. Thus Whitman
had helped to
shape
all three collaborators's impressions of the American scene
and by the
time the
opera opened, a web of Whitmanesque imagery saturated
dialogue, lyrics, and
music, stretching from the black janitor's "Marble and a
Star" to the final
strains of Act II.

The musical adaptation of Rice's play preserved its
intertextual reference
to
Whitman's "Lilacs" as the conclusion to Act I, the duet
"Remember That I
Care."
Comparison of the corresponding scenes in the 1929 script
and the 1946
libretto
(see <a href=2.1kowalke_4.html> 4</a>) demonstrates
how closely the libretto adhered
to the text of
the
original play, although this duet was not among the ten
numbers for which
Elmer
Rice ultimately received credit as co-lyricist with Hughes.
In both play
and
opera, the scene containing the Whitman recitation serves a
pastoral
function
within <I>"verismo" </I>surroundings, as Sam and Rose enact
a ritual of
innocence
prior to their elders's ritual of violence.

<p>
Weill began his musical scene with melodrama, underscoring
Rose's and Sam's
conversation in response to Sam's rhetorical question, "What
good does
[graduating from college with honors] do you when nobody
ever looks at
you--when
nobody cares whether you exist or not?" Anticipating Rose's
answer, "I
care,
Sam," Weill reprises, with muted strings, the refrain of
Rose's ballad
"What Good
Would the Moon Be?" in which she had asked herself similar
questions. When
the
topic of their dialogue turns to rumors about Rose's mother
and her affair
with
the milk collector, the orchestra presents chromatically
twisted
variations on
Mrs. Maurrant's aria, "Somehow I Never Could Believe." Mrs.
Buchanan's
scream of
labor pain precipitates Sam's monologue on the subject of
his own
existential
torment and wrenches the musical idiom out of melodrama and
onto a highly
charged
operatic plane, accompanied by full orchestra and
characterized by the
greatest
density of chromaticism, dissonance, and asymmetries in Act
I. At the
fortissimo
climax of this expressionistic outburst--as close as one
comes to <I>Der
Protagonist </I> in Weill's Broadway works--"the
scream of birth,
the moan
of death" give way to a dejected reformulation of Sam's
question, "What
else has
life got to give?" The orchestra dwindles to only the lowest
members of the
woodwind, brass, and string choirs, thereby providing
maximum timbral
contrast
with Rose's response.

<p>
Her answer, now sung rather than spoken, is once again
anticipated
orchestrally,
with a reprise of the instrumental introduction to "What
Good Would the
Moon Be?"
Marked "tranquillo" in its original appearance in Number 12,
the recalled
music
opens up a pastoral space, a folk-like realm suffused with
pentatonicism,
where
urban musical intrusions are banished by almost magically
transcendent
instrumental textures and fifth-generated harmonies which
coalesce from
celeste,
bells, harp, strings, and solo woodwinds. Here the
intratextual reference
to
Rose's cavatina articulates the scene's (and the opera's)
central visual
and
poetic image, "the lilac bush flow'ring bright." Her
recollection of
seeing the
lilac bush in the park is accompanied in the orchestra by
the melody to
which Sam
will soon recite the third 

<B></B>

 [<a
href="2.1kowalke_4.html">re 4</a>] <b>[Begin Page 49]</B>

 stanza of Whitman's "When Lilacs Last in the
Dooryard
Bloom'd." A single stanza stands in for that entire elegy,
because Weill
omitted
the first strophe, the "false start" of the poem in the
play. The remaining
fragment seems self-contained in its imagery: Sam and Rose,
two
first-generation
children of immigrants, yearn for a small parcel of the
utopian America
symbolized by lilacs in Whitman's pastoral vision and denied
those trapped
in the
city's prisons for the human spirit. With the first stanza
omitted, the
referent
of "the great star early droop'd in the western sky" is no
longer
explicit, and
thus available only to those in the audience already
familiar with the
entire
poem. Similarly, the lilac sprigs are not associated
explicitly with
President
Lincoln's casket, so they can function as a symbol of hope
rather than
mourning.
Weill thereby transforms Whitman's memorial for Lincoln into
a
universalized
expression of mutual affection, a bond between individuals
that must be
the basis
for any honest relationship or just society. And yet, this
diatonic
respite from
Sam's existential despair can be only temporary; those in
the audience who
know
their Whitman already intuit that the thrush's death carol
must soon be
tallied.

Weill's reading makes Whitman's text seem both more and less
than it was
originally and as quoted in Rice's play. As soon as Sam
begins to recite
the
poem, to luxuriant, <I>cantabile </I>orchestral sonorities,
<I>intra</I>textual
references to Rose's cavatina give way to an<I>
inter</I>textual allusion
to the
last vocal utterance in Act II of Puccini's <I>Madama
Butterfly, </I>the
"sostenuto dolcemente" at rehearsal Number 84: "Dammi sul
viso un tocco di
carmino," (put on a touch of rouge).
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
Puccini's and Weill's
melodies
are nearly identical for three measures, yet there seem to
be no directly
congruent textual parallels that might account for the
musical reference
(<a href=2.1kowalke_5a.html>5</a>). However, the
moment in Puccini follows immediately upon
Butterfly's and
Suzuki's famous "flower duet," where images of fragrant
cherry blossoms,
lilies,
jasmine, and violets from the spring garden give Butterfly
new hope as she
decorates the house in anticipation of Pinkerton's arrival:
"diedi pianto
alla
zolla, essa i suoi fior mi da" (I have given tears to the
earth and she
gives her
flowers to me). Suspicions, voiced by numerous critics ever
since <I>Street
Scene</I>'s premiere, that the allusion might be fortuitous
or the musical
idiom
merely "secondhand Puccini" in a more general sense may be
dispelled if one
recalls that the corresponding pastoral moment in <I>Madama
Butterfly
</I>is
prompted by the appearance of an American warship in port:
"Hold my
trembling
hand so that I may read the name: ABRAHAM LINCOLN!"

<p>
For those in <I>Street Scene</I>'s audience who really knew
their Puccini,
this
must have seemed the quintessential musical pun; on
reflection, however,
the
allusion is characteristically ambiguous. Because it both
"distances" and
"affects," its reading presents a challenge. In their duet,
Butterfly and
Suzuki
sing ecstatically of anticipated happiness now that
Butterfly's
long-suffering
faith and hope appear to have been vindicated. They decorate
the house with
flowers; then Suzuki applies makeup to both Butterfly and
her son, in
anticipation of Butterfly's reunion with his father. Soon,
of course, her
"American dream" will be dashed; Pinkerton, incapable of
bridging the
ethnic/cultural gulf that separates them, has married
someone else in
America.
Butterfly's pastoral respite is now recognized to have been
false hope.

 In
Act II
of <I>Street Scene, </I>Sam's sister Shirley tries to
protect her younger
brother
and gives Rose advice that could have been lifted from the
libretto of
<I>Madama
Butterfly: </I>"It's better to marry with your own kind. You
can't mix oil
and
water." The cultural chasm between first-generation Russian
Jewish and
Irish
Catholic immigrants living within the same apartment
building seems even
more
forbidding than that separating Puccini's couple: the
allusion tells us
that Sam
and Rose's relationship is doomed, before it has a chance to
blossom.
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>

<p>
As Rose echoes Sam's recitation of Whitman, she gets carried
away by his
rapturous personalization of the poem. Sam then builds to a
climax as he
sings of
breaking off a sprig of lilac, and Rose joins him in
claiming their fair
share of
the American dream. Immediately, however, Rose retreats from
the emotional
heights she had briefly scaled with Sam and recounts the
reality she had
encountered in the park earlier in the day. Here the
libretto again
paraphrases
dialogue from the play, and all inter- and intratextual
references are left
behind. But Buchanan does not enter at this point, as he did
in the play.
Instead
Sam regains the emotional pitch of his "pain" monologue as
he rails
against the
obstacles standing between him and the lilac bush. Weill had
explained to
Hughes
how he wanted the borders of the finale's lyrical space
extended at this
moment,
compensating for the omission of the first stanza of
Whitman:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
When Rose sings about the policeman in the park she should
continue but
the lilac
bush is there, it is ours, nobody can take it from us--and
that should
build into
a beutiful [sic] duet which reaches its climax (after a
short interruption
with
Buchanan) when he asks her to kiss him, and here, the
lilac-bush theme
should
sing out in the orchestra.
<sup><a NAME="REF76"
HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></sup><!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Indeed, Rose's reminder that the
lilac
bush is theirs--at least in their dreams--allows them to
regain, for the
first
time singing in unison, the ecstatic heights of "A sprig
with its flower we
break." Then, with Rose leading the way, they finally arrive
at a
"tranquillo"
plateau: "And when you see the lilac bush, Bright in the
morning air,
Remember,
always remember, Remember that I care." Singing as if with
one voice, Sam
and
Rose sustain <I>fortissimo </I>high A's for three measures
on the word
"remember," while the orchestra creates an overwhelming
Puccinian climax
with a
tutti recall of the Butterfly-related melodic material--in
the manner of a
parallel <I>fortississimo </I>moment when Puccini's heroine
sings "Trionfa
il mio
amor! La mia f&egrave; trionfa intera" (My love triumphs! My
faith
triumphs over
everything!), also climaxing on a high A (rehearsal Number
70).

<p>
As Weill had suggested to Hughes, Buchanan's entry then cuts
off the final
cadence of the Whitman Duet, and underscoring abruptly
disrupts the idyll.
Maurrant calls Rose into the house, but before she goes
upstairs Sam asks
awkwardly, "Rose, will you kiss me?" She responds as she had
in the play,
"Why,
of course I will, Sam." But after the Whitman text had been
filtered
through
Weill's passionate music, the stage directions from the
original play
proved
unsuitable for the kiss: "She offers him her lips. He clasps
her in a
fervent
embrace, to which she submits but does not respond. Freeing
herself gently
. . ."
Instead the opera's libretto indicates only that "she kisses
him," and the
orchestra accompanies the embrace with a "molto 

<B></B>

 crescendo" of the lilac
theme.
Weill knew the power of his own music; the same day he had
outlined the
Whitman
Duet for Hughes, he wrote to Rouben Mamoulian, whom he hoped
to persuade to
direct the production, and summarized the differences
between the original
play
and his plans for the opera: "The love story between Sam and
Rose will be
made
more important and more passionate." Indeed, in the musical
adaptation, it
is
Rose who initiates the reprise of the Whitman duet after the
kiss. This
time,
however, any associations of the orchestral flourish with
Butterfly are
sublimated to the fresher memory of the "lilac bush, Bright
in the morning
air,"
as the intratextual reminiscence overwhelms the intertextual
allusion. Sam
rejoins the reverie, but Henry, the black janitor, cuts
short any
possibility of
prolonged rhapsody, as he reiterates a shred of his own
utopic credo, the
blues-tempo "I got a marble and a star," code words for his
less-than-cosmic game
of craps.

<p>
This was again Weill doing what he knew how to do, although
"love duets"
are as
rare in his American works as in his European ones. The
Whitman duet calls
to
mind, both textually and musically, another which serves as
an act finale,
"Auf
jener Stra&szlig;e," the ending of Act II of <I>Der
Silbersee </I>.
Here
too the soprano and tenor, Fennimore and Severin, sing with
unveiled
idealism,
eschewing avowals of erotic love in favor of another
pastoral vision, not
of a
lilac bush but of a magical frozen lake that "will carry
whoever must go
further"
(Wer weiter mu&szlig;, den tr&auml;gt der Silbersee). On the
eve of
Germany's
darkest decade, Weill had responded in his unguarded lyrical
mode to Georg
Kaiser's glimpse of a socialist utopia, with exquisite
pentatonic
orchestral
filigree embellishing a diatonic vocal line.
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
Perhaps the
earliest
manifestation in one of Weill's dramatic works of what Horst
Koegler would
describe as "a sincerity of feeling that is not afraid to
reveal itself as
such"
was the so-called "Kraniche Duett," composed in 1929 as a
substitute for
the
censored "Liebe" brothel scene in Act II of <I>Aufstieg und
Fall der Stadt
Mahagonny.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
There, too, uncensored expression of
affection by
another decidedly non-stereotypical couple stands near the
center of the
drama in
sharp relief against highly intertextual and estranging
musical
surroundings. The
head of Universal Edition's opera department, Hans
Heinsheimer, recognized
the
"Crane Duet" as a stylistic breakthrough:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
This is the reason I consider this scene in <I>Mahagonny
</I>so especially
important: here you bring the style of 1928 to a close, here
the new sound
of the
coming years becomes audible, that sound which I believe is

a new
romanticism, a new longing, a new search for the

Agreeing that the music of <I>Mahagonny
</I>far
surpassed that of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper, </I>Adorno too
singled out the
<I>"carmenhaft" </I>duet of Jimmy and Jenny: like Carmen, it
is at once
"captivating and enigmatic."

But when Heinsheimer's prediction for Weill's future path
was validated in
<I>Der
Jasager, Die B&uuml;rgschaft, </I>and <I>Der Silbersee,
</I>such lyrical
passages
of direct emotional expression challenged the prescription
for "surrealist
music"
Adorno had extrapolated from <I>Mahagonny:</I> 

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
The surrealistic intentions of <I>Mahagonny </I>are borne
out by the music,
which, from the first note to the last, is dedicated to the
shock which the
sudden representation of the disintegrated bourgeois world
engenders . . .
. This
music, pieced together from triads and off-notes with the
steady beat of
old
music hall songs, which we hardly recognize any more but are
nonetheless
remembered like an heirloom, is hammered and glued together
with the fetid
mucilage of a soggy potpourri of operas. This music, made up
of the debris
of
past music, is completely contemporary . . . . The music is
allowed to
make use
of triads because it doesn't believe in them; rather, it
destroys them
through
the very manner in which they are used.

<p>
When, therefore, Weill's post-<I>Mahagonny </I>European
music failed to
"shy away
from direct expression," "superimpose its own criticism," or
"electrify its
audiences while slapping them in the face," Adorno turned
his back on it,
and
Weill.
<sup><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
Weill himself recognized that he had left the
<I>Mahagonny</I>-manner behind. After the war, in December
1948, he wrote
to La
Scala in Milan: <I>"Mahagonny </I>is very much an expression
of the decade
after
the First World War." He suggested that instead the famous
opera house
should
consider <I>Street Scene, </I>"an American opera in the true
sense of the
word,
probably the only opera in the vernacular of the large
American
city."
<sup><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>

<p>
Shortly before <I>Street Scene </I>had closed its Broadway
run after 148
performances attended by nearly a quarter of a million
people (but at a
loss of
the producers' entire investment of $148,000), Weill
received a letter
from Georg
Kaiser's widow, with the news that the Hebbel Theater in
Berlin intended to
produce <I>Der Silbersee. </I>Weill did not object, but
could supply no
music: "I
had a letter from Universal Edition with the laconic
notification that all
my
full scores had been confiscated by the Gestapo . . . . I
don't have a
single
partitur of my European works and therefore at the moment I
can't say if
one can
procure them anywhere."
<sup><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
Thus he devoted his energies toward
interesting European opera houses and publishers in what had
been a
Broadway
"flop." He wrote to Langston Hughes: "It is no use fooling
ourselves that
the
songs we have written are hit-parade material, because they
are
not."
<sup><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
When discussing European representation of the work
with
Boosey and Hawkes and Universal Edition, he offered to
expand the
orchestration
from 33 to the standard opera orchestra and to effect
several other musical
changes that would make the piece less "Broadway" and more
"opera."
<sup><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>
During his only trip back to Europe (in 1947), he personally
promoted
<I>Street
Scene </I>in London, Paris, and Z&uuml;rich. He avoided
Germany. Upon his
return,
he told Maxwell Anderson that he was planning a symphonic
suite from
<I>Street
Scene </I>and several more Whitman songs. But Weill
completed only "Come
Up From
the Fields, Father" and did not live to see the stage work
that he deemed
his
most significant performed in the Old World.

<p>
The posthumous European premiere of <I>Street Scene </I>in
D&uuml;sseldorf
during
the 1955-56 season promised to be an auspicious occasion:
the cast would
include
Randolph Symonette (who had played the role of Mr. Maurrant
for most of the 

<B></B>

Broadway run), two numbers cut from the opera during
Philadelphia tryouts
were to
be restored, Lenya would attend, and, not least, Adorno--of
all
people--would
write an essay for the program book. But his essay, "Nach
einem
Vierteljahrhundert" (after a quarter-century), turned out to
be little
more than
a refunctioning of his obituary of Weill in the guise of a
retrospective on
<I>Die Dreigroschenoper </I>and <I>Mahagonny. </I>Although
Adorno
dismissed the
genre of the "Musical" as "merchandised nuisance," he never
mentioned
<I>Street
Scene </I>or any of Weill's other American works by name.
Instead, Adorno
again
hailed those works with Brecht that were characteristic of
the "dilemma of
all
modern art," while planting seeds of doubt about Weill's own
awareness of
the
nature of his achievement:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Like no other music, Weill's stood for the collective image
of the time
during
which it became famous . . . . Its power depends on the
decline of the
time whose
passing it chronicles . . . . Only derision and mockery of
sentiment were
left in
his music, thereby giving expression to a mourning for all
that had been
doomed
by history . . . . But it remains ambiguous just how far the
music commits
itself
to this and how far Weill denounced what he had co-executed
without
commentary .
. . . He would rather sacrifice musical standards than
coherence of
theatrical
effect, for which his method of response had been calculated
<I>&agrave; la
</I>Offenbach, to whom he liked to compare himself.
<sup><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The
subversive
power of Adorno's essay was sufficient to sabotage critical
reception of
<I>Street Scene, </I>as the young Horst Koegler, a recent
refugee from East
Berlin, observed in a review essay entitled "Der Vortrupp
der Musicals"
(the
vanguard of the musical):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
It should come as no surprise that two days after the
premiere the
D&uuml;sseldorfers opened their morning papers to be told by
their critics
that
they had attended an operatic funeral of the first class.
Those present at
the
premiere would hardly have noticed anything like a funereal
atmosphere.
Instead
they applauded after almost every other number of the score
and at the end
called
the members of the cast in front of the curtain some twenty
times . . . .
Though
none of the critics denied the success with the audience, it
didn't
prevent one
of them from putting two short sentences together: "Reicher
Beifall. Wie
denn
auch nicht!" [Lots of applause. What else would you expect!]
Those six
words are
too beautiful to resist the temptation to reflect upon a
group of critics
who
obviously champion progressivism at any price--to whom any
genuine public
success
is suspect from the outset.

<p>
Throwing down the gauntlet at Adorno's feet, Koegler jumped
to the defense
of
American musical theater in general and Weill in particular,
while
challenging
ideological and aesthetic clich&eacute;s:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
The assessment of Kurt Weill's Broadway successes swings
back and forth
according
to the critics'--or their respective newspaper's--political
point of view.
Between them, practically every perspective is represented:
from the
tradition-conscious European's feeling of infinite
superiority,
nonchalantly
looking down on the fully-automatic American "un-culture";
to the rueful
mea
culpa one--after all, we were the ones who 

<B></B>

 had driven Weill into the
desert of
the rich flesh pots. Therefore over here--or at least as far
as our
critics are
concerned--practically everything which carries the stamp of
a Broadway
success
has been condemned to failure.
<sup><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Although his counteroffensive
may
have been overstated and under-documented, Koegler correctly
observed
that--before his emigration--Weill had severed himself from
Brecht and what
Adorno termed surrealism: "At that time he had long outgrown
the
<I>Dreigroschenoper, </I>to which some people stubbornly try
to weld him .
. . .
Nobody who knows his work not just from the shark with the
teeth in his
face will
deny that Weill secretly has been a romantic."
<sup><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>

<p>
In his reply to Koegler, "Vortrupp und Avantgarde," Adorno
made passing
reference
to <I>Down in the Valley </I>and the songs from <I>Lady
</I>and <I>Venus
</I>which he found difficult to distinguish from Cole
Porter, but there is
still
nothing to indicate that he had become more familiar with or
had actually
attended a performance of <I>Street Scene. </I>Instead, he
rebuffed
Koegler's
attack by expanding his original argument, this time making
more explicit
its
underlying premises, respectively technical and
sociological: 1.
Weill-after-Brecht had failed to adopt a progressive musical
language and
thus
was more culpable than Stravinsky (or Britten and
Shostakovich) of the
charges
which Weill-with-Brecht had only narrowly avoided by
transferring the
"Verfremdungseffekt" (estranging effect) into the musical
realm; 2.
objections to
the pseudo-individualized, mass-produced cultural
merchandise Adorno
thought to
be "jazz" (actually German commercial music of the 1920s)
were equally
applicable
to American musical theater.
<sup><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>
Jazz and the "Musical" were
linked in
Adorno's mind because the "popular song," <I>Schlager,
</I>served as the
central
unit of both. As so-called "mass music," popular songs,
jazz, and musicals
are
all necessarily anonymous, or at best pseudo-individualized.
Only the
formulas
need be deciphered, not the individual uses thereof, for
this music is not
"that
which it is" but "that for which it is employed." And just
as Adorno rarely
mentions in his jazz criticism the name of a jazz composer
or performer,
the
title of a song or jazz number, or a particular recording or
live
performance, so
the "Musical" is discussed only in generic terms, without
reference to
specific
works. The person responsible for the music of a "Musical"
is not a real
composer, but a <I>Musikregisseur, </I>comparable to the
jazz arranger,
making
music to fit the contingencies of the situation. Adorno
closed his
sarcastic
reply by declining Koegler's suggestion that he write an
essay "Vom Altern
der
neuen Kritik" (new criticism is growing old) and countering
with his own
assignment for Koegler, "Der Highbrow als Lowbrow," the
theme of which he
outlined: "The highbrow has in many places set himself up as
the staunch
cultural
advocate of the lowbrow. For God's sake, it would be better
for him to
remain a
highbrow and let himself be called a snob."
<sup><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>

<p>
In this assignment for Koegler, Adorno had unwittingly
invoked terminology
from
Constant Lambert's 1933 review of <I>Die sieben
Tods&uuml;nden, </I>in
which he
compared Weill with Adorno's teacher:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Even those who do not find Weill's music sympathetic must
realize that he
symbolizes the split that is taking place not between
highbrow and
lowbrow, but
between highbrow 

<B></B>

 and highbrow . . . .
He and Alban Berg represent the two
extremes of Central European aesthetic, and in their widely
different ways
are
the most successful exponents of their respective styles.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Had
Adorno
been more familiar with Weill's Broadway works in general
and <I>Street
Scene
</I>in particular, he surely would have chosen different
turf for his
battle with
Koegler, for <I>Street Scene, </I>as we have seen, can't be
easily
dismissed as
"Kitsch," the category to which Adorno automatically assigns
the
"Musical." On
the other hand, in the wake of the triumphant European tours
of Robert
Breen's
production of <I>Porgy and Bess, </I>Koegler's appropriation
of <I>Street
Scene
</I>as a platform from which to challenge the prevailing
ideology of
post-World
War II Central European musical modernism must have seemed
strategically
defensible. It is in this larger aesthetic context that we
must ultimately
situate the Adorno-Koegler polemic in particular and the
two-Weill debate
in
general.

<p>
Weill, the composer whom Richard Taruskin has identified as
"perhaps the
twentieth century's most problematical major musician"
("RT"), seems in
retrospect a, if not <I>the, </I>representative re
reifying the key
issues at
hand: modernism versus counter- or postmodernism, elitism
versus populism;
autonomy versus accessibility; originality versus
comprehensibility;
atonality
versus tonality. He anticipated in the second quarter of our
century what
can now
be seen in the fourth as the central "problem" of the entire
post-War
period:
what is the "genuine" or "authentic" modern music of our
century? It was
precisely this question which Adorno himself raised in 1949
at the
conclusion of
his <I>Philosophie der neuen Musik: </I>"Perhaps the only
authentic art
will be
that which renounces the very idea of authenticity itself,
of being one
particular way rather than another."
<sup><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>
However, Adorno's
ongoing
attempts to refunction the historical paradigm of musical
progress,
extending
from Bach through Beethoven to Schoenberg and his serial
successors,
required
affirmation of aesthetic autonomy, work immanence, and
originality as the
<I>sine
qua non </I>for "authenticity." When these values came under
increasing
scrutiny
and attack in the "pluralistic, postmodern, and
aesthetically entropic
world"
Adorno left behind at the time of his death in 1969,
salvaging that part
of his
mission which would stave off collapse of the Austro-German
"great works"
tradition became a key component in what James Hepokoski has
called the
"Dahlhaus
Project."
<sup><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>
Although Weill's name appears in Carl Dahlhaus's
writings
only rarely and always in tandem with Brecht's, he is by
inference one of
those
"opera composers who felt unequal to the aesthetic problems
imposed upon
their
genre by Modernism" and therefore "sacrificed stylistic
modernity to
theatrical
effectiveness and thereby lost all claim to historical
'authenticity.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></sup>
In a history of music whose ideology required
"relative autonomy" for itself as well as its subject, it
becomes clear,
for
reasons too obvious to restate, why Weill ends up on
Dahlhaus's "ash heap
of
music history."

<p>
"Had Weill continued to develop after 1933 as he had in the
previous
years,"
begins David Drew's final paragraph in the <I>New Groves
</I>Weill-entry,
"he
could have become one of the commanding res in German
music" rather
than "one
of 

<B></B>

 music's great 'might have beens,'"
as its last sentence concludes. It
would
seem, therefore, that Weill's American works will require a
defense
protecting
them against their success which is more vigorous and
imaginative than
Adorno's
for <I>Die Dreigroschenoper, </I>because the split between
autonomy and
accessibility and what Richard Crawford has termed
"composers' music" and
"performers' music" (as an alternative to the categories of
<I>E-Musik/U-Musik,
</I>"serious"/"popular," or "cultivated"/"vernacular") has
always seemed
more
pronounced on American soil. In <I>The American Musical
Landscape,
</I>Crawford
frames the debate in post-Adornian terms:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
autonomy--the right to compose essentially outside the
strictures of
audience
esteem, or critic's approval, or the tastes and preferences
of performers
. . .
Through hard labor and the acceptance of a lofty, lonely
vision of their
calling,
composers have carved out for themselves an autonomous
niche. Autonomy has
expressed itself in a feeling that . . . composers are
perhaps the best
judges of
each others' works. The twentieth century has seen the
gradual alienation
of many
composers of composers' music from other musical trades and
occupations
and from
much of the concert-going audience as well.
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In contrast, Crawford says, "where music reflects the
pressures of the
marketplace, money and musical style are closely
intermingled.
Accessibility
seeks out the center of the marketplace. It privileges
occasions over
works. And
it invests ultimate authority in the present-day audience."
Authenticity in
performance is closely linked with autonomy, as
"authenticity privileges
works
over occasions."
<sup><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></sup>

<p>
Among Central European &eacute;migr&eacute;
composers, the extreme exemplars of Crawford's taxonomy
were, of course,
Schoenberg and Weill. When asked in 1950 how migration had
affected the
character
and quality of his own work in America, Schoenberg replied:
"If
immigration to
America has changed me--I am not aware of it . . . . Maybe I
would have
written
more when remaining in Europe, but I think: nothing comes
out, what was
not in.
And two times two equals four in every climate. Maybe I had
<I>four times
four
</I>times harder to work for a living. But I made no
concessions to the
market."
<sup><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></sup>
In his own manifesto of 1940, Weill articulated his
agenda
by contrasting it with Schoenberg's: "I'm convinced that
many modern
composers
have a feeling of superiority toward their audiences . . . .
I write for
today."
<sup><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></sup>
Such statements make Andreas Huyssen's bold assertion
that
"mass culture has always been the hidden subtext of the
modernist project"
seem
almost a truism, and they call to mind aesthetic and
sociological
conflicts that
extend at least as far back as Nietzsche's indictment of
Wagner: "Success
with
the masses no longer sides with those who are authentic . .
. . Wherever
the
decision comes to rest with the masses, authenticity becomes
superfluous,
disadvantageous, a liability."
<sup><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></sup>

<p>
In the American musical
theater,
Weill encountered these same issues, intricately
intertwined: compositional
"work" and performance "event" overlapped and merged in the
process of
production; in non-subsidized venues accessibility took
precedence over
autonomy;
and popular exploitation and adaptation of single numbers
(stripped of
their
original dramatic context and function) by performers active
in commercial
music
tended to undermine the integrity of his music for the
theater. 

<B></B>

 But if we
recall
Heinsheimer's and Downes's parallel exhortations to the
composer, written
in 1929
and 1949 respectively ("You should and must free yourself
once and for all
from
Berlin's commercialized artistic activity" and "I am still
waiting for the
day
when you get exactly the subject which you can treat without
the faintest
consideration of public taste or expediency of any sort"),
the "two-Weill"
debate
cannot be disguised as cultural or geographical--European
versus
American--in
nature or origin. Though ostensibly raised by biographical
circumstances
and
historical events, the issues are central to the
self-conscious dilemma
during
the entire modernist period concerning the nature, meaning,
and purpose of
art in
general and of musical expression in particular.

<p>
"What are the aims of music?" Weill's teacher Ferruccio
Busoni had asked
in his
<I>Entwurf einer neuen Aesthetik der Tonkunst </I>(sketch
for a new
aesthetic of
music; 1907) and then tried to answer anew after World War I
with his
concept of
"junge Klassizit&auml;t" and his opera <I>Doktor Faust.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></sup>
Such
post-war attempts to reconcile past and present were
characteristic of what
Martha Bayles calls "extroverted modernism," whose attitude
toward
accessibility/popularity differentiates it from its
"introverted" and
"perverse"
kin.
<sup><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></sup>
If, in aspiring to be, as Busoni quipped, "a Verdi of
the
poor,"
<sup><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></sup>
by 1927 Weill had rejected the former option--"working
toward
the solution of aesthetic problems as if behind closed
doors," eliminating
the
criterion of accessibility or popularity from aesthetic
judgments, and
cultivating indifference, even hostility toward the
audience--his
subsequent
"perverse" or surrealist phase did not outlast his
collaboration with
Brecht and
the fall of <I>Mahagonny</I>.
<sup><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></sup>

<p>
In 1930 Erwin Stein, then the head of Universal Edition's
orchestral
division,
tried to change Weill's mind and convince him "to make
another appearance
as an
absolute composer," thereby "expanding your sphere of
influence and making
your
work felt in circles which have been up in arms against
you": "And don't
tell me
that you don't give a for such people--you must make an
effort to win
them
over as musicians."
<sup><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></sup>
Shortly before he fled Berlin for Paris
Weill
did accept a commission for a symphony from the Princesse
Edmond de
Polignac, but
after its premiere by the Concertgebouw Orchestra under
Bruno Walter in
1934 he
dismissed the effort as "not very important." Soon after his
arrival in the
United States, Weill reaffirmed the futility of writing
autonomous music:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
In our time theater-music is far more important than
absolute music. Maybe
that
was not true in previous centuries, but it certainly is now.
Concerts are
becoming more and more the property of--how do you call
them?--stuffed
shirts.
The recital hall is obsolete.
<sup><a NAME="REF106"
HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></sup><!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In privileging stylistic
diversity
over individual subjectivity, the theater over the concert
hall, the
audience
over the composer-critic, the "immediate" over the
"difficult," Weill made
no
apologies: "I want to use whatever gifts I have for
practical purposes,
not waste
them on things which have no life, or which have to be kept
alive by
artificial
means. That's why I've made that theater which exists
without benefit of
subsidy
my life work" ("CT"). Music could not afford to be only "in
and of
itself." Weill
required that it aspire to extrinsic value and serve as a
means to moral or
political 

<B></B>

 impact on an audience
expecting to be pleased and entertained as
well
as edified. No wonder, then, that within Adorno's
uncompromising and
rigorously
"introverted" stance, such a composer scarcely qualified as
a <I>Komponist
</I>at
all, and two Weills had to be created so that the
"historically authentic"
part
of him could be salvaged. But in declining to be <I>einsam
</I>and daring
to be
<I>&ouml;ffentlich, </I>Weill had been attempting all along
to redefine not
himself, but modern music theater and its audience, as well
as the
aesthetic and
historical model in which he must be divided in two.

Dietrich eventually declined the role, claiming that it was
"too sexy and
profane" for her, an ironic excuse made more so by Mary
Martin's portrayal
of
Venus. In autumn 1933 Dietrich had requested two songs from
Weill as revue
and
recording material, but there is no record of her performing
or recording
either
of his responses, "Der Abschiedsbrief" and "Es regnet." In
March 1934
Dietrich
did, however, lobby Josef von Sternberg to invite Weill to
Hollywood to
collaborate on her planned musical film; protracted
negotiations came to
naught.

informed Ira

a letter of 8 March 1941:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Virgil Thomson wrote a violent attack against me. t was all
very personal
and his
main point was that I am no good any more since I stopped
working with
Brecht and
that I am "constantly avoiding" collaborating with "major
poets" (a rather
bold
statement, don't you think so?). Well, I am used to this
kind of attacks
from the
part of jealous composers. In some form or another it
happens every time I
do a
new show.

(March-April

next was a
flattering
profile of Virgil Thomson. After other attacks similar to
Barlow's and
Thomson's,
Weill discouraged his producers from inviting music critics,
with the
exception
of the <I>Times</I>'s Olin Downes, to opening nights of his

<I>The Saturday Review of Literature, </I>31 December 1949.
It is in
this
essay that Clurman first articulates his "Hottentot
metaphor." Clurman
had been
one of three founding directors of the Group Theatre; in
1936 he was
replaced
during rehearsals as stage director of <I>Johnny Johnson
</I>by Lee
Strasberg.
After the Group disbanded, Clurman became one of the most
highly respected
theater critics in New York. Weill was deeply offended by
the essay; among
his
surviving papers are (mostly illegible) pencil notes and two
typewritten
paragraphs in response to Clurman (Series 41, Box 2).
Weill's prefatory
paragraph
does not disguise his sense of personal betrayal: "It always
seemed to me
one of
the more commendable customs of our time is that a man
should not talk
back to
his critic. If I don't adhere to this rule in the case of
Harold Clurman's
article 'Lost in the Stars of Broadway,' it is because it
seems to me that
this
article was not written as a criticism of my music (since
Clurman
certainly is
not a music critic), but as a well-meant advice from an old
friend."
Weill's
projected defense seems to rest on the premise that "certain
musical
circles are
so far removed from the living theater that they have little
understanding
for a
movement which has its roots more in theatrical than in
musical
developments.
This is nothing new . . . . When I started writing music in
Europe in the
early
twenties, Verdi was looked upon as a writer of 'Circus
Music' and Carmen
was
generally considered an 'operetta' in musical circles. . . .
Some people
don't
seem to think that music [written for Broadway] is 'good
music.'"

February 1951. Note that Thomson's assessment had been quite
different in
his
1950 obituary of Weill: "Everything he wrote became in one
way or another
historic. He was probably the most original single workman
in the whole
musical
theatre, internationally considered, during the last quarter
century . . .
Every
work was a new model, a new shape, a new solution of
dramatic problems."

In 1938, however, Lenya had reported to Weill in Hollywood
that she
was going
"to have dinner with that Ho-ho-Wiesengrund at the home of
Jews from
Frankfurt .
. . After dinner, they will make an abortion of the music
they'll play."
Letter
from Lenya to Weill, 10 May 1938. Apparently Weill and
Adorno never met in
New
York, as a letter of 31 March 1942 from Adorno in Brentwood
Heights, Los
Angeles,
to Weill in New City, New York, begins: "Dear Weill, it will
amaze you to
hear
from me all of a sudden after so long a time and an
ill-fated rendezvous

response to
Adorno has

Brecht's:

[Clarence] Muse writes me that Brecht had told him last
summer he had
written to
me and I didn't answer! The good old swinish Brecht method.
Well, I wrote
Wiesengrund a letter which he won't forget for some time. I
wrote him: It
is a
shame that a man of your intelligence should be so
misinformed. Then I
explained
him that the American Theatre isn't as bad as he thinks and
in the end I
said,
"maybe the main difference between the German and the
American theatre is
the
fact that there exist certain rules of fair play in the
American theatre."

Public,

Market: Kurt Weill and Universal Edition" in <I>A New
Orpheus, </I>29-31.
Even if
he had been so inclined, Weill would have been unable, given
political and
economic circumstances, to follow his publisher's admonition
to avoid
"commercialized artistic activity." Not a single work of
Weill composed
after
1927 and intended for production by state-subsidized
theaters or opera
houses
found a secure home there. Most notably, all three of
Berlin's opera houses
declined to produce <I>Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny
</I>after its
highly
politicized reception in the provinces. Similarly, the
Kampfbund f&uuml;r
Deutsche Kultur assured that there could be no successors to
the three
productions of <I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft </I>which premiered
within a single
week in
March 1932. Less than a year later three productions of
<I>Der Silbersee
</I>opened simultaneously in Leipzig, Erfurt, and Magdeburg,
but soon
closed
under a blanket edict. <I>Der Kuhhandel </I>and <I>Der Weg
der Verheissung
</I>could find no appropriate venue anywhere in Europe.
Already in Europe,
then,
more and more of Weill's plans and projects had addressed
themselves to
alternative institutions where diverse combinations of
executants and
audiences
could be assembled ad hoc: radio, schools, film,
metropolitan commercial
theaters.

observed:
"It's awfully interesting to me to see your hand get firmer
with each
thing you
are doing, and your new treatments and forms and new
technical resources.
It is
wonderful that you've got such an opera over on the stage.
This work, and
the
<I>Street Scene, </I>will be among the most significant
steps which have
so far
been taken both to modernize and popularize the operatic
principle, and say
something worthwhile in the artistic sense."

Weill had already
claimed: "We may change our music only to the extent that we
can carry on

intellectual tasks, the duties of the artist in his time, in
an entirely
perceptible, entirely understandable language." The original
reads: "Wir

reads: "Eine

Weill
felt it necessary to utilize several settings of Rilke's

intermediate
step in the compositional process for the orchestral
<I>Fantasia,
Passacaglia,

Broadway,
"Kurt
Weill on Broadway: The Postwar Years (1945-1950)," Ph.D.
Dissertation,
Harvard
University, 1992, David Kilroy compares the "outsider"
characters Jud and
Sam and
contrasts the mid- and post-War cultural contexts of
<I>Oklahoma! </I>and
<I>Street Scene: </I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The lonely Jud is the uncritical male antagonist, ostracized
as an
outsider who
threatens the lily-white "folk"; the lonely Sam is an
intellectual male
protagonist, both admired and mistrusted for is outsider's
criticism of
American
society . . . Weill's presentation of his view had to wait
until after the
war's
end, for to suggest that "outsider" citizens be treated with
all due
rights and
privileges may well have been considered anti-American
during World War II
. .
.After the war had ended, however, he and Rice could hope
that the
suspension of
civil liberties that were to some degree warranted by
wartime exigencies
would
cease. Yet, fueled by <I>Oklahoma!</I>'s<I>
</I>unprecedented longevity and
continued proclamation that vigilante justice was "OK" in
the United
States, the
country was very slow in reversing its ideological direction
and became
embroiled
in other repressive activities, especially against real and
supposed
Communists.

"SP." The term "musicodramatic agent" has been borrowed from
Carl
Dahlhaus's
description of the function of setting within <I>verismo
</I>opera, where
"milieu
moves center stage as a musicodramatic 'agent.'" In this
sense at least,
<I>Street Scene </I>seems to conform to Dahlhaus's category
of operas which
feature local color or "milieu-painting": "although
<I>verismo </I>adopted
a
realist or naturalist pose by choosing subjects from normal
life and the
present
day, from the standpoint of intellectual history it can be
viewed as a
variant of
exoticism, the appeal of the faraway and remote . . . Local
color, which
seemed
'new' and yet was immediately accessible, offered a refuge
to opera
composers who
felt unequal to the aesthetic problems imposed upon their
genre by
modernism."

Letter from Weill to Hughes, 20 September 1946. David Kilroy
notes
that Weill
even offered Hughes (in a letter of 15 May 1946) Christopher
Isherwood's
translation of Peachum's "Lied von der Unzul&auml;nglichkeit
menschlichen
Strebens" as a model for a lyric for Kaplan. "Kurt Weill on
Broadway," 96.
It was
Hughes's sense that Weill continually tried to make
<I>Street Scene
</I>into
something more like <I>Die Dreigroschenoper </I>than what
Elmer Rice had
in mind.

When the collaborators needed a lyric for a dance number,
Hughes had
brought
"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed" out of his trunk; although it had
been written
years
earlier, it required virtually no changes as the text of a
32-bar popular
song.
Eventually it was cited as the best lyric of the Broadway
season.

I am grateful to Michael Pisani for pointing out the melodic
similarity of
these two passages. Although Kilroy noted the pastoral
features of the
Whitman
Duet, he maintained that "the music to which Weill set the
quotation from
Whitman
is virtually free of intertextual allusions" ("Kurt Weill on
Broadway,"
194).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT75" HREF="#REF75">75</a>.
Shortly after <I>Street Scene </I>had opened on Broadway,
Weill
agreed to
appear on "Opera News on the Air," during the intermission
of a radio
broadcast
from the Metropolitan Opera--the only such invitation he is
known to have
accepted. The opera Weill agreed to discuss was <I>Madama
Butterfly.
</I>The host
of the program, Boris Goldovsky, introduced the topic of
<I>Street
Scene</I>'s
Puccini-isms: "You know, it occurs to me, Mr. Weill, that
your <I>Street
Scene
</I>is just the sort of play that would have appealed to
Puccini if he were
living and writing in America today." Weill: "I'm mighty
glad that Puccini
didn't
have a chance to see <I>Street Scene </I>when it was
produced as a play
almost 20
years ago. Because he might have beat me to it." Weill then
described
Puccini and
his opera as if speaking of himself and <I>Street Scene:
</I>"I have the
feeling
that Puccini wasn't particularly interested in musical
experimentation for
its
own sake, but rather in the effect it would have on the
audience in the
opera
house . . . . His audience had probably never heard a score
which
introduced
present day people, dressed in present day clothes, [which]
translates a
realistic story completely into music, so that the story
moves along as
swiftly
as in a legitimate play." Weill's copy of the typescript for
the interview,
annotated with his own handwritten additions and corrections
(Series 41,
Box 3),
called for Goldovsky's other guest, Irene Jordan, to mention
as one of the
highlights of <I>Madama Butterfly </I>the "glorious duet
with Suzuki,
where they
decorate the house with flowers for Pinkerton's arrival."
Goldovsky played
the
end of the flower duet, and then "another interesting
example": "the
section just
after the flower duet, where Butterfly looks at herself in
the mirror and
wonders
whether the passing of three years has robbed her of her
beauty. 'I have
changed,' she says. 'My lips have sighed too many sighs and
my eyes have
scanned
the horizon too long.'" Weill commented: "We shouldn't lose
sight of the
fact
that all these musical devices are a means to an end, not an
end in
themselves."
<I>Madama Butterfly </I>was not among the eight vocal scores
of operas in
Weill's
library inventoried by David Drew in 1960; <I>Turandot,
</I>however, was:
it had
been an opening night present for <I>Lady in the Dark
</I>inscribed to
"Giacomo
Weill from Gabriele Gershwin." Ralph Locke has suggested to
me that the
repetitive harmonic oscillation underlying the Whitman Duet
may have been
modelled on a similarly constructed passage in Calaf's Act I
aria, "Non
piangere,
Li&ugrave;," eleven measures before Rehearsal Number 46. The
orchestral
accompaniment of Sam and Rose's other duet, "We'll Go Away
Together," may
call to
mind ironically the passage immediately preceding "Un bel
di," in which
Butterfly
insists "He'll come back."

<I>Der Silbersee </I>and <I>Street Scene </I>bear comparison
in other
respects: both are hybrid works intended for performance by
a mixed cast of
singers and actors, with comparably sized orchestras.
Melodrama plays a
larger
role in the musical texture of these two works than in any
others of
Weill. Note
also the textual and musical parallels between "Auf jener
Stra&szlig;e" and
another pastoral number, "The Hills of Ixopo," the opening
of <I>Lost in
the
Stars. </I>The musical setting of this picture of pre-urban
South Africa
is also
suffused with pentatonicism, but as that idyllic landscape
is corrupted,
chromaticism enters the musical language and soon overwhelms
the folk-like
idiom
of the opening.

On 9 October 1947 Weill wrote to Max Dreyfus of Chappell:
"As you
remember, I
had great hesitations to have <I>Street Scene </I>published
by Chappell's.
I
wanted to give it to Boosey and Hawkes because with them I
would have been
sure
of the kind of standard exploitation which this score calls
for, of an
English
production (Covent Garden) and of performances in European
opera houses."
On 11
December 1948, Weill wrote to Traute von Witt at Universal
Edition in
Vienna:
"Die Oper war f&uuml;r die speziellen Erfordernisse des
Broadway-Theaters
f&uuml;r ein verh&auml;ltnism&auml;ssig kleines Orchester

geschrieben, und
ich frage mich, ob das f&uuml;r die grossen Opernh&auml;user
ausreichend
w&auml;re. Da es wahrscheinlich f&uuml;r eine
Auff&uuml;hrung in dieser
Saison
schon zu sp&auml;t ist, w&uuml;rde ich die M&ouml;glichkeit
in Betracht
ziehen,
eine neue Orchestration f&uuml;r Opernh&auml;user
ausuarbeiten, und in

Fall auch einige musikalische Aenderungen (weniger Dialog,

Zweideutig
bleibt,

<p>
Ever since modernists such as T. S. Eliot misrepresented (or
perhaps
miscomprehended) the work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the
intellectual
structure of his art--both painting and poetry--has been
seriously
obscured. The problem is sharply focussed in Rossetti's
connection to
Dante and his circle. For Eliot and those who took up his
way of thinking,
Rossetti had a weak understanding of <I>stilnovista
</I>poetry and almost
no understanding of Dante: his mind was too sentimental, his
emotions too
fleshly, his language too loose and Victorian. Yet the
judgment that
Rossetti lacks intellectual rigor, now widespread, runs
against earlier
views. Indeed, the argument was mounted specifically to
counter certain
received ideas, to challenge the programmatic quality of
Rossetti's art,
and to contradict Rossetti's famous commitment to
"fundamental
brainwork."
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
As everyone has always known, however,
Rossetti's is--spectacularly--an art of the body. Before
1920 or so people
were able to negotiate that basic paradox in Rossetti's
work. Afterwards
not.

<p>
I'd like to carry us back across the divide opened by
Eliot--back to the
cultural moment when Rossetti's work centered the movement
that ushered in
modernism proper. This reconsideration will ultimately allow
us to make a
critical return to the subject of modernism. The
differentials that
separate Rossetti from his immediate inheritors can usefully
be seen not
as deficiencies in Rossetti or his work, but as forecasts of
the critique
that postmodernism would eventually raise against the
modernist project. 

<B></B>

<p>
My argument will extrapolate that foundational concept of
Rossetti (and
through him, of the Aesthetic Movement in general):
"fundamental
brainwork." Drawn from his concern with artistic technique,
the word
"brainwork" subtly undermines the distinction between idea
and act, or
theory and method. The "brainwork" of a disciplined
artisanal practice
organizes the artist's intuitive and emotional insights. As
we shall see
when we examine Rossetti's crucial connection to Dante, the
famous
declaration in "The House of Life"--"Thy soul I know not
from thy body,
nor/ Thee from myself, neither our love from God"
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
--expresses
exactly what Rossetti has in mind. In this case the terms
are--as so often
with Rossetti--erotic.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
Rossetti's purposes are expressed very clearly in his famous
pair of
sonnets "Mary's Girlhood," written to accompany his first
Pre-Raphaelite
picture <I>The Girlhood of Mary Virgin. </I>We should recall
that the
painting was itself a manifesto about art, as one sees in
the heated
controversy that followed its exhibition in 1849.

<p>
When it was shown at the Free Exhibition, the painting's
implicit argument
was underscored by the presence of a slip of goldfaced paper
he attached
to the frame. Two sonnets were written on the golden slip,
as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's Virgin. Gone is a
great while, and she
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was young in Nazareth of

Her kin she cherished with devout respect:
<BR>
Her gifts were simpleness of intellect
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And supreme patience.
From her mother's knee
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faithful and hopeful; wise
in charity;
<BR>
Strong in grave peace; in duty circumspect.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel-watered lily,

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows,
and is quiet. Till one dawn, at home
<BR>
She woke in her white bed, and had no fear
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all,--yet wept till
sunshine, and felt awed;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
the fullness of the time was come.

<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those virtues are wherein

<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup><!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Formally these texts come as a two-handed engine for
interpreting the meaning of the painting. The first sonnet
identifies the
subject, her primitive historical position, her moral and
mythological
character within the medieval context of Maryolatry. But
even as the
second sonnet brings forward its elaborate symbolic
interpretation of the
pictured details, it no more operates as a Christian
interpretation than
the first sonnet. Rather, the second sonnet locates the
historicality of
all these materials, identifying them as "medieval." This
identification
comes through the act of stylistic analysis performatively
displayed in
the poetry's consciously antiqued style.
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
So the sonnets are not so much an interpretation as the
representation of
an interpretive field. Attached to the painting's frame, the
sonnets label
the work as "medieval." Their technique appears most
dramatically in the
mannered self-consciousness of verses like these:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Therefore on them the lily standeth, which
<BR>
Is Innocence, being interpreted.
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The artificial style is a quasi-allegorical signal
referencing an idea of
the medieval-archaic. In such a context, the symbolistic
potential of the
imagery gets broken down. The verse turns what might have
been (in a
medieval context) a symbol into the briefly annotated index
of a symbol.
Twentieth-century writers and theorists will make much of
what Rossetti is
doing here; they will call it "laying bare the device." For
an agnostic
like Rossetti, the critical presentation of Christian
materials allows him
to construct his contemporary artistic manifesto. The
manifesto is
performative, the image of a pastiche of an antique set of
signs.

<p>
This manifesto argues that "meaning" is not a function of
concepts and
general ideas but of particular (artistic) practices.
Highlighting the
apparent medievalism of his subject matter, Rossetti
historicizes the
whole symbolic field. More important still, he forces us to
think about
those historical materials in specifically artistic terms.
So the
Christographic symbology becomes the form of an artistic
expression and
style rather than the vehicle of religious concepts and
ideas. Rossetti
thereby urges the otherwise Christian symbology to carry
purely aesthetic
and artisanal significance. Rossetti's sonnets and their
associated
painting are not about Catholic or Christian matters, they
are about Art:
specifically, about what he called "the Art Catholic," a
phrase in which
the word "Catholic," self-consciously historicized through
an obsolete
grammar, gets opened to its root (and secular) meaning.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
A brief excursus on the immediate context of Rossetti's work
is useful,
for it will help to explain why he occupied the programmatic
vanguard of
the early Pre-Raphaelite movement. The Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood's
emphasis upon meticulous and accurate rendering of painterly
details
provoked a novel tension in their work. Whereas the
Pre-Raphaelite subject
often carried weighty allegorical 

<B></B>

 and
religious meanings, those
tradition-borne symbolic structures tend to move out of
focus as the eye
is assaulted from every quarter by all kinds of arresting
details, many
hardly relevant to the apparent or nominal subject. In his
treatment of
such details Rossetti differs sightly but significantly from
both Holman
Hunt and John Everett Millais. In <I>The Girlhood of Mary
Virgin, </I>for
example, Rossetti does not load the painting with detail, he
formally
structures his details so that they carry a general burden
of meaning
about the significance of painterly detail in itself.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
This is
why his painting is such an effective painterly statement
about the
ability of art to embody and express meaning in nonsymbolic
ways. The same
kind of ordered formality, as we have seen, governs the
presentation of
the medieval symbology in the sonnets.

<p>
Rossetti's difference from Hunt and Millais is quite
instructive. Their
early work provoked the hostility of people like Charles
Dickens partly
because of their remarkable attention to close rendering of
physical and
historicist detail. Viewers were particularly dismayed at
the details in
paintings on moral and religious subjects. If these
particulars were not
"mean, odious, repulsive, and revolting" in themselves, they
distracted
the attention from the main subject's "religious aspirations
. . .
elevating thoughts . . . or beautiful associations."
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Such at
any rate was the charge.

<p>
Ruskin defended Hunt's <I>The Awakening Conscience
</I>against these
objections on two grounds, one general, one particular. The
details, he
argued, were dramatically appropriate "in this instance,"
i.e., they
represented the realistic rings "of a mind which has
been fevered by
violent and excessive excitement." This special pleading,
needless to say,
scarcely addresses the real issue of "the general propriety
of such
treatment," as Ruskin called it. That "general propriety"
is, of course, a
recurrent topic in <I>Modern Painters; </I>and Ruskin's
argument is that
the artist's primary attention must always be directed to
the work as
such, to the act of painting. The modern painter's true
subject is never
the nominal subject, it is the artist's own artistic
fidelity and
devotion. For Ruskin, Hunt is one of those contemporary
"poetical" artists
bent upon "inventing the story as they painted it."
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The
nominal subject only lives by virtue of the expressive vigor
of the artist
and his work.

<p>
So if an apparent excess of detail can detract from the
painting's nominal
subject, it simultaneously urges the viewer to reformulate
the subject in
other (i.e., in aesthetic) terms. Ruskin's defence of the
Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood registers his awareness of this pictorial
urgency in their
work. In this respect, Rossetti's secular and polemical
stylistic manner
has a clear parallel with the explicitly devotional work of
Hunt. The more
we focus on the details, the more reflexive (rather than
reflective) the
works become. The "story" they tell is the act of painterly
invention;
Ruskin calls such work "poetical" exactly because he reads
it in this
aesthetic way. In this sense, Hunt's <I>The Awakening
Conscience </I>and
<I>The Light of the World </I>are less the names for
subjects in the
paintings than they are the names of the paintings
themselves. These
paintings bring their light to the world, whose aesthetic
conscience is
meant to be awakened through the experience. The light of
the world is art
itself, the awakening conscience is a redeemed aesthetic
sense (whether in
the artist or in the viewer). 

<B></B>

<p>
I am speaking of these works, you will say, in
twentieth-century terms;
and of course Pre-Raphaelite art is not Action Painting. But
this later
vocabulary is useful for calling attention to the decidedly
polemical-aesthetic quality of Pre-Raphaelite work. If the
Pre-Raphaelites
did not break completely with representational tradition,
they were
determined to undermine some of its most fundamental
premises. The
conceptual character of their work comes not from an
aggressive
abstraction, as in modernist art, but from a hyper-realism
that
anticipates certain postmodern styles. The Pre-Raphaelite
program
encouraged artists to handle their traditional subjects with
greater
imagination. Through their notorious attention to detail,
Pre-Raphaelite
painters were trying to break into free acts of
inventiveness. The
sympathetic viewer of the period--in this case,
paradigmatically, John
Ruskin--responds in kind. In <I>The Awakening Conscience
</I>Ruskin's
conscience is also awakened:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
There is not a single object in all that room--common,
modern, vulgar (in
the vulgar sense, as it may be), but it becomes tragical, if
rightly read
. . . . Nay, the very hem of the poor girl's dress, at which
the painter
has labored so closely, thread by thread, has story in it,
if we think how
soon its pure whiteness may be soiled with dust and rain,
her outcast feet
failing in the street.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
That is criticism in the sentimental style of the period.
And if it might
be argued that "This [kind of talk] is allowing fancy
excessive liberty"
with the painter's work,
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
it should also be said that its
freedom corresponds to what happens in the painting, which
treats its
nominal subject in an equally "excessive" fashion. In each
case the excess
signals a new kind of devotional activity: on one hand a
devotion to
painterly practice, on the other to the practice of
criticism. Both are,
in Ruskin's terms, "poetical"; indeed, they are moral and
religious
because they are, first of all, "poetical."

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_a-head-->

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Rossetti's critical intelligence as an artist lies
essentially in this:
that he sought a programmatic expression for a new kind of
artistic
representation. He is extremely self-conscious both as a
technician and,
in much of his work, as a polemical theorist. More than
that, because the
polemic is being made on behalf of art as a nonconceptual
form of
understanding, Rossetti is most theoretical in his
explanations when he
expresses himself in artistic (rather than conceptual)
terms. So he will
interpret a painting by writing a sonnet, or a poem by
making a painting.
So he will elucidate the poetry of Dante and his circle by
translating
them into equivalent poems. Rossetti constructs an argument
in images for
the procedure of arguing by images.

<p>
Eliot's celebrated 1929 essay on Dante exorcises Rossetti's
translations
as "Pre-Raphaelite tapestry"
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
--the phrase being a kind of
objective correlative that means "brainlessly decorative."
The judgment is
especially damning, from Eliot's viewpoint, because his
essay celebrates
Dante's art exactly for its conceptual virtues. 

<B></B>

 Dante's poetry is stronger
than Shakespeare's, he argues, because the one works within
a coherent
conceptual framework while the other does not.

<p>
If we recall Rossetti's general approach to his
translations, we can see
the problem a reader like Eliot is immediately going to
have:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
The life-blood of rhymed translation is this,--that a good
poem shall not
be turned into a bad one . . . . Poetry not being an exact
science,
literality of rendering is altogether secondary to this
chief aim. I say
literality,--not fidelity, which is by no means the same
thing.
<sup><a NAME="REF12"
HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup><!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
To the polemical modernist critic, judgment here is
all but foregone since Rossetti works in a style--decorative
and
rhetorical--that was the precise object of modernist attack.
Rossetti's
poetry will always turn good early Italian poems into bad
Victorian ones.
The wholesale repudiation of Rossetti's translations--like
the widespread
praise they received before Eliot's essay--reflects a
cultural
predisposition, not a dependable judgment about the work
itself.

<p>
Let me observe in passing that Rossetti's translation
program implicitly
summons some kind of aesthetic value judgment, whether
favorable or not.
His collection prizes and means to collect the "good poem,"
not just verse
that might have some purely historical interest. And his
translator's rule
lays upon him the obligation to write good poetry in his
turn. It is a
bold move, and one that Ezra Pound would imitate, though he
was not always
very gracious in acknowledging his debt to Rossetti's
theoretical lead. It
was also a move that laid Rossetti open to Eliot's line of
attack; for if
a serious change in poetic style and taste were to become
culturally
canonized, as in fact happened in the mid-twentieth-century,
then
Rossetti's work would no longer even have its own
ground--artistic
fidelity--to stand on.

<p>
When scholars have tried to assess Rossetti's translations
objectively,
the consensus is far more favorable than not.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Of course the
difficulty of translating syllabic into accentual verse is
formidable.
Furthermore, the cultural distance separating Rossetti's
world from
Dante's is perhaps even more daunting. First of all--as is
well
known--serious medieval thought (say Dante's and
Cavalcanti's) and serious
Victorian thought (say Rossetti's and Ruskin's) are all but
incommensurable. Indeed, it is the absoluteness of the
differential here
that helps to explain the nineteenth-century's (historicist)
fascination
with the middle ages.

<p>
A second great difficulty is purely linguistic.
<I>Stilnovista </I>Italian
is refractory in part because its immediate poetical
heritage sometimes
displayed a diction littered with shards of corrupted Latin
and early
Italian dialectal forms. The so-called Sicilian School,
centered at the
court of Frederick II in Palermo, began the vernacular move
against this
linguistic inheritance. The "sweet new style" of the
<I>stilnovista
</I>movement culminates the effort to purify vernacular
poetry of its
linguistic crudities. Indeed, some of the most spectacular
<I>stilnovista
</I>moments come when the stylistic and linguistic issues
are held in the
foreground. <I>Stilnovista </I>verse is commonly far more
strict and even
stiff in its formalities than the Sicilian and troubadour
writings it
builds upon. In this respect, the highly polished and often
mannered
correctness of 

<B></B>

 Rossetti's verse style
clearly aims to represent the spirit
of the poetry he was translating.

<p>
There is no question, I think, that Rossetti understood the
problem he was
confronting and that he proposed an impressive scheme for
addressing the
difficulty. Because the scheme is grounded in what Rossetti
calls
"paraphrase," we are apt to imagine--this was Eliot's
imagination--that
Rossetti's irreligious (or nonreligious) translation is a
travesty of
Dante. But this is to misunderstand what Rossetti is trying
to
"paraphrase." He is not after a contemporary equivalent for
the theology
or a conceptual content of the verse. What he wants is a
contemporary
equivalent of its form and style, its way of making an
argument through
images.

<p>
Rossetti's procedure is evident in all of his translations,
not just the
work with Dante. I give one typical but peculiarly salient
illustration--a
passage from Giacomo Pugliesi, an "early Italian poet" of
the sicilian
school:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Madonna, chi lo tene lo suo viso
<BR>
in sua balia?
<BR>

<BR>
E lo tuo franco cor chi me l'ha priso,
<BR>
[oi] don[n]a mia?
<BR>
Ov'&egrave; Madonna? e lo suo insegnamento?
<BR>
La sua bellezza, e la sua
canoscianza?
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Rossetti renders the passage as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Who hides that smile for which my heart is sore,
<BR>
And drowns those words that I am longing for,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady

<BR>
Where is my lady, and the lovely face
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She
had, and the sweet motion when she walk'd?
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In one sense this is deliberate mistranslation. But the move
is
programmatic and goes to the very heart of what Rossetti
believes can and
should be done when a specifically poetical translation is
being
undertaken for these kinds of pre-modern texts. In such
cases one's
primary obligation is to seek a "paraphrase" for the
poetry-as-such--a
paraphrase that holds strictly to the level of the poetic
signifiers. To
"paraphrase" this text's conceptual "content," in Rossetti's
view, is to
find a conceptual form that short circuits any move to
non-formal or
non-sensuous levels of expression.

<p>
Criticism inspired by Eliot will therefore deplore
translations that
fashion sensuous equivalents for the "moral and spiritual"
ideas of
medieval verse. Rossetti's sins of omission are said to be
even worse. In
the Pugliesi passage, for instance, it is argued that
Rossetti "seems to
have disliked or been bored by the convention of the lady as
teacher or
moral guide."
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
This view comes because the translation gives
no literal equivalent for the key word "insegnamento." But
the truth in
this case is highly revealing. Rossetti hasn't ignored
Pugliesi's word, he
has "translated" it by distributing its meaning--his
understanding of its
meaning--across the entire surface of 

<B></B>

the passage. Rossetti translates
back through the root (segno) of the evolved moral term
(insegnamento).

<p>
This kind of move, recurrent in the translations, defines
the
self-conscious physicality of their style. Approaching a
word such as
"insegnamento" as an icon rather than a concept, Rossetti
reads it as an
allegorical sign whose meaning lies not in what it means,
but in how, and
in the very fact that it means. The procedure is the precise
equivalent of
what we saw earlier in <I>The Girlhood of Mary Virgin
</I>and its
associated sonnets. In translating, Rossetti always moves
toward
rative equivalents. So here he reads Pugliesi in
radically formal
terms, as if the Italian text were a language of pure
signifiers. He
therefore transforms the sequence of what might otherwise be
taken for
abstract terms, "insegnamento . . . bellezza . . .
canoscianza," into a
ral language of seductive gesture: "The lovely face /
She had, and the
sweet motion when she walked." In Rossetti, what Pugliesi's
Donna teaches
is an art of embodied practice.

<p>
The form of Rossetti's translations implicitly makes an
argument about the
character of <I>stilnovista </I>poetry. He takes its moral
and
philosophical terminology as a ral system readable by
those who have a
Dantescan "intelletto d'amore."
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
For him, the <I>stilnovisti
</I>poets (and Dante pre-eminently) harrowed the symbolic
order by a root
and branch literalizing process. So Dante's Beatrice is for
Rossetti a
literal form of love. If Dante's ideological horizon
translated Beatrice
into elaborate conceptual equivalents--and it most certainly
did--Rossetti
took all the equivalents at face value. They are for him
decorative
additions to the central (artistic) event: not truths but
forms of truth.
Exactly the same should be said of any biographical or
historical
equivalents--Beatrice as Beatrice Portinari, for example.
All such forms
are "symbolic" and "interpretational" shapes fashioned by
the further
adventures of an idealizing imagination. For Rossetti,
Dante's importance
lies not in his ideology as such, whether
philosophical/theological or
historical/realistic, whether Catholic or--as his father
thought--Masonic.
It lies in his art, and in his work's implicit argument that
knowledge,
expressed in and through the res of art, is revealed as
a practice.
The order of images is primary, as is the authority of the
signifiers.
Love itself, the supreme good, begins when one submits to
that order,
which demands performance. Knowledge is a continual process
of knowing,
Love of loving; and Art is a continual process of inventing
forms that
display those ideal human acts.

<p>
When Rossetti's translations are examined at the level of
the word and the
phrase, then, we can understand the sharp divergence of
opinion about the
quality of the translations. An aesthetic sensibility will
tend to respond
favorably, a moral or philosophical one will not. The issue
here is
strictly stylistic--though nonetheless crucial for that very
reason, since
Rossetti's translations argue that the meaning of Dante's
work was
fundamentally a matter of form and style, that its "content"
was best
taken 

<B></B>

 as a <I>ra </I>and image of
its performative truth. The
modernist attack on the translations took the form of an
attack on their
style. Rossetti typically leaves the order of the signifieds
to fend for
themselves, or treats them as second order signifiers.
Rossetti turned to
Dante because he found in his work a renascence of the
authority of the
signifiers. The <I>stilnovista </I>translations, in this
respect, were a
series of exercises by which Rossetti trained himself to
approach writing
in a purely formal and decorative way. This technical
approach anticipated
the methods of many modernists, and was all the more
dangerous, to a
sensibility like Eliot's, for that very reason. For
Rossetti's
translations are grounded at a profane (Victorian) distance
from medieval
Catholicism; indeed, they assume that the ideological gulf
between the
middle ages and the nineteenth century is absolute. If
religion and
morality change, however, the practice of art persists. This
practice is
what lies open to translation. To be true to Dante and his
circle, then,
demands aesthetic translation. One good poem deserves
another.

<p>
To understand Rossetti's poetry in this way is to recognize
the mistake in
Nicolette Gray's conclusion about Rossetti's way with
images. Gray
understands that Rossetti learned a "method of images" from
Dante.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
But she goes on to argue that Rossetti lacked a
crucial "map" for organizing his intense images. "The place
of the
particular images must be seen against the background of an
order in the
abstract ideas in the mind" (<I>RDO, </I>28-29). When Gray
looks at
Rossetti's surfaces, she observes the extreme play of the
detail: "the
very intensity of the presentation stresses its
particularity, its
momentariness, Rossetti cannot put it in the clear light of
day, like
Dante's other illustrator Botticelli" (<I>RDO, </I>29). But
Gray is
mistaken. Rossetti has simply chosen to "put it in the clear
light" of a
"day" that is not medieval. Rossetti has a "map," a
conceptual scheme for
organizing his materials. The map is the critical program of
historicist
analysis.

<p>
This is a strictly formal way of approaching Dante's poetry.
It may be
disapproved for any number of reasons, of course. What
cannot be said is
that it lacks either procedural or abstract rigor. And what
cannot be
gainsaid is that it allowed Rossetti to appropriate one of
the most
startling and innovative features of Dante's early writing.
In this case
we are still dealing with matters of poetic form, but the
formalities
involve larger procedural operations.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Rossetti's habits of
revision are notorious. He worked and reworked both his
paintings and his
poems obsessively--not as if to refashion them for different
audiences and
occasions, though he did do this, but as if his efforts
might finally
achieve some ideal perfection. These localized reworkings
replicate
Rossetti's habit of thinking and rethinking the organization
of his
collections of poems. The case of the 1870 <I>Poems </I>is
exemplary, as
is the centerpiece of that volume and of Rossetti's poetical
work as a
whole: "The House of Life" sonnet sequence. In 1869-70 alone
Rossetti
played with a bewildering series of possible orderings for
the poems in
the volume, and for the sonnets in the sequence (which
formed one section
of the volume).

<p>
"The House of Life" sonnets are especially important to
consider here
because the sequence is structured in terms of an implicit
narrative. The
story involves a 

<B></B>

 young man, an artist,
and two (at least two) idealized
women. The young man's love for one of the women succeeds to
his love for
the second. The first woman dies--it is not entirely clear
if her death
occurs before or after his second love--and the events
radically intensify
the man's erotic yearning for perfect love. This new desire
is haunted by
feelings of guilt and remorse, and dominated by ambiguous
images of death
and otherworlds.

<p>
Now this sequence, like Dante's <I>Vita Nuova, </I>has often
been read as
poetically heightened autobiography. The key historical
equivalents--the
persons, the dates, the places--are in each instance well
known. Indeed,
there is little doubt that Rossetti took the <I>Vita Nuova
</I>as a model
and precursor, if not even a forecast, of his sonnet
sequence. Each work
tells a story of an artist's quest for ideal love. Each
quest centers in
the image of an ideal woman, and in each case death
intervenes in a
dramatic and decisive way. Dante has a kind of second love
as well, the
"screen lady" (or, as in Rossetti, the screen ladies) to
whom he addresses
some of his poetry. Finally, both works are organized
reflexively. Looking
back upon past events, both construct an explication of the
secret meaning
of those events--a meaning both works represent as implicit
in the events
from the beginning, though at the time the meaning was
unknown or
unapparent.

<p>
For all these similarities, of course, the emotional
structure of the two
works is very different. This difference is crucially
located in the
status of each poet's doubled love. Dante's screen lady is
never a serious
object of his devotion; she is a device, a means by which he
can conceal
his true love from worldly understandings and curiosities.
Rossetti, by
contrast, is fully devoted to the beloved and the
<I>innominata, </I>and
his double attachment defines what it means to be "Lost on
Both Sides." So
while the <I>Vita Nuova </I>unfolds an unambiguously
redemptive action,
"The House of Life" closes in an obscure and troubled "one
Hope," "alone."
That difference exactly marks the belatedness of Rossetti's
work, and the
self-consciousness with which he undertakes his Dantescan
pursuit. Indeed,
Dante is important for Rossetti partly because he represents
the ideal of
an integral imagination.

<p>
Nowhere do we see Rossetti following Dante more closely than
in the way he
(re)organizes his poetry. "The House of Life" (in its first
published
form) tells a story of events that can be interpreted as
falling roughly
between 1860 and 1871, its key date being the death of the
poet's wife in
February 1862. The real-time composition of the sequence as
a whole begins
in 1869 and is never really completed. Rossetti published
two versions,
one in 1870, the second in 1881, though he constructed many
more.

<p>
The <I>Vita Nuova</I>'s story has been similarly
circumscribed, its key
date falling in June 1290, the month of Beatrice Portinari's
death. The
story it tells begins in 1274 when Dante first sees Beatrice
(he is nine
years old, she is eight). For nine years--according to the
<I>Vita
Nuova</I>'s retrospective prose account--he haunts her
presence, trying to
see her whenever he can. Then in 1283 she gives him her
famous
"salutation." This event throws him wholly under the
dominion of love. A
year or so after Beatrice's death Dante begins to compose
the <I>Vita
Nuova. </I>He completes the work sometime between 1292-1295.

<B></B>

<p>
Rossetti clearly understood--and came to understand even
more deeply--the
key formal innovation of Dante's poetical autobiography. He
knew that most
of the poems inserted in the <I>Vita Nuova </I>narrative
were not written
for the reasons and with the meanings supplied by the
autobiographical
interpretation. Indeed, many of the poems--for example the
crucial first
sonnet--were written entirely apart from the Beatricean
circumstances--not
to say the Portinarian circumstances--that dominate the
<I>Vita Nuova.
</I>That interpretive frame is supplied retrospectively--is
initiated, in
fact, through the <I>Vita Nuova </I>itself.

<p>
Dante does not conceal this structure of the autobiography,
though his
revelation is oblique--presumably in order to separate those
who have
intelligence of love from those who do not. "A ciascun'alma
presa" is an
explicit request for an interpretive response from others:
they are to
write back to him ("mi rescrivan") what they make of the
dream as it is
represented in the poem. The set of answering sonnets is now
well-known,
the most famous being from Cavalcanti, Cino, and Dante da
Maiano. These
responses mirror Dante's sonnet, which is the initial
interpretive act.

<p>
When he narrates all this in the <I>Vita Nuova, </I>Dante
says that "the
true meaning of that vision was not then perceived by
anyone, though it be
now evident to the least skillful" (<I>EIP,</I> 228). That
is to say, the
passage of time has exposed the full structure of
events--the Beatricean
scheme--that explains the dream. More than this, the
Beatricean plot also
gives new life and meaning to Dante's poetry. It makes
possible not only
the work titled <I>Vita Nuova, </I>but the marvelous new
life announced
and revealed there. So the <I>Vita Nuova</I>'s first sonnet
"now" ("ora,"
ca. 1292) begins to tremble with thoughts Dante did not have
when he wrote
it in 1283. In this respect the total experience gravitating
around this
first sonnet defines the <I>Vita Nuova</I>'s entire
structure of meaning.

<p>
So far as Rossetti is concerned, two matters are especially
important. The
first appears in his translation--or his
"mis"translation--of the opening
lines of Dante's sonnet:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
To every heart which the sweet pain doth move,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto which these words
may now be brought,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For true interpretation
and kind thought . . . . (<I>EIP,</I> 227)
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The freedom of this rendering is sharply located in the
third line, which
corresponds to Dante's "mi rescrivan suo parvente."
Rossetti's rendering
seems to me brilliant--a perfect example of what he meant by
"fidelity"
rather than "literality" in translation.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
When Dante's "mi
rescrivan" becomes "true interpretation," Rossetti is
defining
interpretive truth--meaning--as poetry. Just as human events
are most
revealed through poiesis, the "true interpretation" of a
poem is another
poem.

<p>
Secondly, when Rossetti translates the <I>Vita Nuova
</I>according to this
theory of translation, he is explicitly aligning himself
with Dante and
his circle. Dante says in his autobiography that the dream's
meaning is
"ora . . . manifestissimo." Rossetti's poetical translation
thereby
translates Dante's "ora" to the "now" of Rossetti's
nineteenth century. In
doing so, it implicitly defines the "ora" as an eternal now,
a moment in
and out of any historical time, a moment that arrives with
the arrival of
a poetical act. 

<B></B>

<p>
The act may appear either as vision or revision: dream or
text, poem or
translation, a new work or a reconstitution. The latter are
in certain
respects the most dramatic instances of Rossettian art in
its vita nuovan
mode. In "The House of Life," for example, as in the <I>Vita
Nuova,
</I>many poems were written years before the sequence was
even thought
about--in certain cases, years before Rossetti had even met
Elizabeth
Siddal or Jane Burden Morris. A poem like "Lost on Both
Sides," written in
1854 but first published in 1869 as part of "The House of
Life" project,
illustrates what Rossetti had learned from his study of the
<I>Vita Nuova.
</I>When Dante places his early poems in the interpretive
context of the
<I>Vita Nuova, </I>the meaning of the poems shifts
radically. That shift
in meaning locates one of the central subjects of the
sequence as a whole:
the revelation of a fatality in Dante's life and work, and
of secret
meanings in his writings that only get exposed when his
life's fatalities
unfold over time. Rossetti treats his own poetry in the same
way. "The
House of Life" mixes early poems, from the 1840s and early
1850s, with
later ones; and the mixture, as in Dante, forces the early
poems to yield
up their hidden meanings. Furthermore--and the parallel with
Dante is
again very clear--the mixture works to suggest that every
"present" moment
of a poem or work of art is pregnant with unknown
futurities. So the poems
as they appear in the 1870 "House of Life" will undergo
another
meaning-shift when they reappear in the 1881 version.

<p>
Those futurities are especially important for Rossetti
because his work is
tormented by its own desires. Fate in Dante is the
revelation of a
prevenient benevolence, whereas in Rossetti Fate is ominous
precisely
because one can't determine the moral value of the signs.
One only sees
that they have moral value. Rossetti learned from Dante a
method for
revealing the prophetic power of artistic forms of
expression. From that
comes the "visionary" quality of his work: the understanding
that forms
and images possess powers in themselves, powers that cannot
be
comprehended or even entirely controlled by the artist who
is their
medium. But Rossetti's visions are not governed by a
religious ideology,
as Dante's are. He understood Dante's faith, but his
understanding was
strictly a "critical" one.

<p>
The vision conveyed through Rossetti's work is therefore
religious in tone
but skeptical in its understanding. While Dante reveals the
presence of
spiritual forces in the human world, Rossetti's work argues
that the world
is a kind of incarnate spiritual manifold. This way of
thinking is not at
all pantheistic because the locus of the spirit is not on
the nonhuman
plane but exactly on the human one. Inhabiting (and even
incarnating) a
spiritual state in this way carries a paradoxical
consequence: that one
cannot establish a fixed perspective on one's condition,
whether from
below or from above. Every vantage is provisional,
relativity is the
permanent rule of order. Hence the intensity and
particularity of the
Pre-Raphaelite images.

<p>
And (finally) hence too the portentous and even threatening
character of
so much of Rossetti's work, especially the later work; as if
it were
declaring, with Hamlet, that

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

<p>
The Rossetti one sees in this essay is a re whose
methods closely
correspond to many we associate with twentieth-century
writing, modernist
as well as postmodernist. Pater, Wilde, the early Yeats and
the early
Pound all took Rossetti as a fundamental point of departure.
Pater's
superb "Dante Gabriel Rossetti" (1883, 1889) set Rossetti
apart as the
most original poet of the age, the one writer who had made
truly novel
technical and artistic advances. "At a time when poetic
originality in
England might seem to have had its utmost play," Pater
writes, Rossetti
came "with a structure and music of verse, a vocabulary, an
accent,
unmistakably novel."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
To emphasize the technical basis of
Rossetti's originality is in itself to argue Rossetti's
"modernism." But
when Pater goes on to elaborate the specific features of
that originality,
one sees why so many early twentieth-century writers found
Rossetti an
important resource.

<p>
Three matters are especially significant. First, Pater
emphasizes the
extreme self-consciousness of Rossetti's work--what Pater
calls the
"genuine intellectual structure" displayed in his writing
(<I>PR,</I>
496). Rossetti makes technique--his artistic practice--a
central subject.
Second, Rossetti's work invents a whole new vocabulary and
method of
images. This centers in Rossetti's "care for minute and
definite imagery"
derived from his study and translation of the early Italian
poets
(<I>PR,</I> 490). Here Rossetti anticipates not merely the
Imagist
movement but the materialist "thing-tradition" that so
dominates
twentieth-century writing.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Third, Rossetti develops what
Pater calls a "mythopoeic" method from his study of the
Middle Ages
(<I>PR, </I>492): that is, his work unfolds a revelation of
"the ideal
aspects of common things" (<I>PR,</I> 397).

<p>
Given these features of his work, we might well puzzle over
Rossetti's
virtual disappearance from the discourse of modernism. The
event is
explicable, however, if we recall two of the most salient
cultural facts
of English-language modernism: first, the centrality of a
certain way of
reading of Joyce's work; second, the dominance that Eliot's
Christian
reading of modernism had in the schools.

<p>
The Rossetti-Joyce connection is located in the re of
Stephen Dedalus,
whose villanelle in <I>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man
</I>establishes his Rossettian credentials. The poem is
regularly read as
the emblem of a romanticism that imprisons Stephen. In
<I>Ulysses
</I>Joyce will dramatize an artistic method that has escaped
the dead end
of Stephen's Pre-Raphaelite allegiances. This is a perfectly
just reading,
although it can lead to far more problematic interpretations
(e.g., the
unequivocal celebration of Molly and Leopold Bloom over
against the
tormented and brilliant Stephen). Rossetti's adherence to
the romantic
tradition is close and deep, nor does he make any
programmatic refusals of
that tradition, as the modernists tend to do. From our later
twentieth-century perspective, however, one might well want
to argue that
Rossetti's romantic allegiances--especially his <I>Sehnsucht
</I>and
radical skepticism--begin to reveal features of his work
that seem
distinctly postmodern. The argument would proceed through a
total recovery
of the romantic heritage, not just the modernized
romanticism of "strong
poets" that was served up in response to early modernist
criticism. Unlike
both of the latter, Rossetti's is a contaminated 

<B></B>

 romanticism, one in which
the poet comes to resemble Tennyson's Ulysses, who became a
part of all
that he had met: all, the best as well as the worst.
Debasement is a
self-conscious feature of Rossetti's work from the outset;
far from being
a sign of artistic failure, however, it is the ground of the
originality
Pater discerned. It is equally the forecast of his
postmodernism.

<p>
Eliot celebrated Joyce's <I>Ulysses </I>in a famous
review-essay where he
sketched the technical achievement of the book, its "mythic
method"
whereby art was, he said, once again made possible for the
modern
world.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
The argument is especially interesting in light of
Pater's celebration of a corresponding mythic method in
Rossetti. Eliot's
refusal to follow Pater here can and probably should be
explained through
the special character Eliot assigned to the "myth"
represented in the work
of Dante. Pater explicitly links Rossetti's "mythopoeic"
method to
Rossetti's study and understanding of Dante. But for Eliot,
it is one
thing to erect an arbitrary running parallel with a pagan
text like the
<I>Odyssey </I>or with primitive solar myths like those
explicated by Sir
James Frazer. To treat Dante's work in equivalent ways,
which is exactly
what Rossetti did, is implicitly to argue that the Christian
mythos has no
special historic privilege. Rossetti's Dante is a technical
resource and
inspiration, not a repository of fundamental moral truth.
Rossetti
therefore treats his "Art Catholic" in purely artistic
terms, the way
Joyce used Homer. But for Eliot, it is exactly Rossetti's
technical
approach to Dante and the Christian mythos flowing through
him that makes
Rossetti a dangerous and finally an impossible model.

Rossetti does not "literally" render Dante's third line ("in
cio che
mi rescrivan suo parvente"); in particular, he introduces
the term
"interpretation", which is nowhere in Dante, and he leaves
out the
"literality" of "writing back". The move is so effective
because it
displays--indeed, it enacts--Rossetti's understanding that
"interpretation" is or ought to be an active event, more a
"rewriting"
than a reading. Dante's friends are poets, they "interpret"
his poetry by
writing other poems. For Rossetti, this is being
<I>faithful </I>to the
original poetic impulse. His own method of translation is a
similar act of
faithfulness, rather than "literality".

<p>
January 1931. In the "News Notes" at the back of <I>Poetry
</I>magazine,
Harriet
Monroe announced that the February issue would be edited by
one "Mr. Louis
Zukofsky, who has been for several years a prominent member
of a group of
writers
interested in experiment in poetic form and method . . . .
Mr. Zukofsky is
recommended on the high authority of Ezra Pound and others
whose opinions
we
greatly respect."
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
But, having "abdicated [her editorial
powers]
temporarily," Monroe evidently felt betrayed. In the March
issue, she
wrote an
angry response to the "Objectivist" number of <I>Poetry
</I>called "The
Arrogance
of Youth." Zukofsky, she insisted, was wrong to "abandon"
such big poetry
names
as E. A. Robinson, Robert Frost, Edgar Lee Masters, and Edna
St. Vincent
Millay,
as well as the "once-revolutionary imagists." And "what,"
asks Monroe,
"are we
offered in exchange? A few familiar names get by [she is
evidently
thinking of
William Carlos Williams's "Botticellian Trees"] though often
by severely
wrenching Mr. Zukofsky's barbed-wire entanglements."
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
What was the nature of the "Objectivist" experiment, as
represented by
Zukofsky's
selection for <I>Poetry, </I>a selection that included,
aside from the
obvious
names (Basil Bunting, George Oppen, Carl Rakosi, Charles
Reznikoff,
Zukofsky
himself), Robert McAlmon and Kenneth Rexroth, Whittaker
Chambers and Henry
Zolinsky, John Wheelright and Martha Champion? And in what
sense was the
work of
these poets a departure from that of the "once-revolutionary
imagists"? 

<B></B>

Williams,
for one, seems to have been skeptical, even though
Zukofsky's
<I>"Objectivists"
Anthology </I>of the following year contains a large
selection of his own
poems.
In a letter of 1928, he told Zukofsky:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Your early poems, even when the thought has enough force or
freshness,
have not
been objectivized in new or fresh observations. But if it is
the music,
even that
is not inventive enough to make up for images which give an
overwhelming
effect
of triteness . . . . The language is stilted "poetic" except
in the places
I
marked. Eyes have always stood first in the poet's
equipment. If you are
mostly
ear -- a newer rhythm must come in more strongly than has
been the case so
far.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
As examples of such "stilted 'poetic'" language, Williams
singles out the
phrases
"all live processes," "orbit-trembling," "our
consciousness," and "the
sources of
being" in what he calls Zukofsky's "Lenin poem," "Memory of
V. I.
Ulianov."
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
"[I]t may be," he admits, "that I am too literal
in my
search for objective clarities of image. It may be that you
are completely
right
in forcing abstract conceptions into the sound pattern . . .
. It may be
that
when the force of the conception is sufficiently strong it
can carry this
sort of
thing . . . . Perhaps by my picayune, imagistic mannerisms I
hold together
superficially what should by all means fall apart."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
The recognition that "imagistic mannerisms" may well have
had their day is
echoed
by Ezra Pound. Having urged Harriet Monroe to put Zukofsky
"at the wheel
of the
Spring cruise," as he put it in a letter, and having
"refused to
contribute to
Aldington's Imagist mortology 1930," which he dismisses as
"20 ans apres,"
Pound
urges Zukofsky to make his special issue "a murkn number;
exludin the so
different English." Indeed, if Zukofsky does his job, Pound
suggests,
<I>Poetry
</I>might once again be "what it was in 1912/13, the forum
in which the
Zeitideen
WERE presented and discussed."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
But the "Zeitideen" of 1931 were, as Pound himself was the
first to
recognize
("Prob[lem] ain't now the same"), no longer those of 1913.
For one thing,
the
relationship between tradition and the new had become vexed.
"The number
ought to
be NEW line up," Pound repeatedly urges Zukofsky. "You can
mention me and
old
Bill Walrus [Williams] in the historic section . . . . I do
not think
contributions from ANYone over 40 shd. be included; and
preferably it shd.
be
confined to those under 30" (<I>PZ</I>, 51-52). And he notes
acutely, "ONE
notable difference between yr. position in 1930 and mine in
1910 is that
you
would LIKE to include several older american authors. Bill,
Me and I
suppose
Possum Eliot, with Cummings an already known name"
(<I>PZ</I>, 53).

<p>
Zukofsky responded defensively. "The only progress made
since 1912,"
writes the
twenty-six-year-old poet to his forty-six-year-old mentor,
"is or are
several
good poems, i.e. the only progress possible--&amp; criteria
are in your
prose
works" (<I>PZ</I>, 65). And again, "Think I'll have as good
a 'movement'
as that
of the premiers imagistes--point is Wm. C. W. of today is
not what he was
in
1913, neither are you if you're willing to contribute--if
I'm going to show
what's going on today, you'll have to. The older generation
is not the
older
generation if it's alive &amp; up . . . . What's age to do

<B></B>

 with verbal
manifestation, what's history to do with it?" (<I>PZ</I>,
67). Which Pound
shrugs
off laconically: "In 1913 les jeunes did not respect their
papas. In 1930
there
are a few middle-aged bokos that we can afford to let live"
(<I>PZ</I>,
74). It
was fine, in other words, for Zukofsky to reprint, in his
preface to the
<I>"Objectivists" Anthology, </I>Pound's own Imagist
manifesto in "A
Retrospect"
, along with his famous division of poetry into three
"kinds"
(melopoeia,
phanopoeia, logopoeia) articulated in "How to Read" ,
and to quote
the
opening of the newly completed Canto XXX ("Compleynt,
compleynt I hearde
upon a
day"). And the <I>Anthology </I>is dedicated to Pound, who
"is still for
the
poets of our time / the / most important."

<p>
A certain sense of belatedness -- the belatedness usually
associated with
our own
postmodern ethos -- thus haunts Zukofsky's production. But
then "Make it
new!"
could hardly be the watchword of a poetic generation that
came of age in
the
Great Depression, a generation that understood that the
"new" was by no
means
equivalent to the true, much less to the good and the
beautiful. Just the
same,
despite Zukofsky's own evident inability to articulate the
difference
between
Pound's aesthetic and that of the <I>"Objectivists"
Anthology </I>that he
had
assembled, there really was something new going on in that
anthology, as
in the
little magazines of the early 1930s in general. Indeed, with
the hindsight
of the
1990s, the early 1930s were <I>anni mirabiles </I>for
poetry, as the
magazines
that now replaced the <I>Dial </I>and <I>Little Review
</I>(both ceased
publication in 1929)--magazines like <I>Blues, Morada,
</I>the <I>New
Review,
Furioso, New Masses--</I>testify. The <I>"Objectivists"
Anthology, </I>for
that
matter, far from being the anomaly Zukofsky and Oppen
scholars have often
taken
it to be, was in fact representative of a larger aesthetic
that has been
insufficiently distinguished from its modernist past and its
postmodernist
future. The shift that takes place at the turn of the decade
is one from
the
modernist preoccupation with <I>form </I>in the sense of
imagistic or
symbolist
structure, dominated by a lyric "I," to the questioning of
<I>representation
</I>itself. Discourse now becomes increasingly referential,
but reference
does
not go hand-in-hand with the expected mimesis. Rather, the
boundaries
between the
"real" and the "fantastic" become oddly blurred. The taste
for the
"natural," as
in Pound's insistence that "The natural object is always the
adequate
symbol,"
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
gives way to artifice and a marked taste for
abstraction
and conceptualization. In the same vein irony, so central to
modernist
poetics,
gives way to the parodic, but even parody is often not
sustained, with
abrupt
tonal shifts and reversals in mood becoming quite usual.
Indeed, this
"time of
tension," to borrow Eliot's phrase from his 1930 poem "Ash
Wednesday,"
exhibits a
mannerist style as distinct from its modernist antecedents
as from the
socialist
realism to come.

<p>
In the discussion that follows, I take as my example a
single "little
magazine,"
<I>Pagany, </I>which ran for twelve issues between January
1930 and
December
1932, thus coinciding with the darkest years of the
Depression, from the
October
1929 Wall Street crash to the election of Roosevelt and the
coming of his
New
Deal in 1932. It was in <I>Pagany, </I>edited by an affluent
young Boston
litterateur named Richard Johns,
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
that Williams published the
first
ten chapters of <I>White Mule </I>and such famous short
lyrics as "Flowers
by the
Sea" and "The Red Lily"; Stein, the first version of
<I>Before</i> 

<B></B>

 <i>the Flowers
of
Friendship Faded Friendship Faded; </I>Pound, Cantos
XXX-XXXII as well as
critical commentary; and Zukofsky, <I>"A" </I>1. In his
capacity as
informal
poetry advisor,
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
moreover, Zukofsky evidently persuaded Johns
to
publish poems by his "Objectivist" friends Rakosi,
Reznikoff, Oppen, and
Bunting,
by Rexroth and Yvor Winters, Mary Butts and Mina Loy. But
<I>Pagany
</I>also
published such early "naturalist" fiction as Edward
Dahlberg's <I>Flushing
to
Calvary, </I>Erskine Caldwell's <I>American Earth
</I>stories, and John Dos
Passos's <I>Eveline </I>from <I>U.S.A.</I>

<p>
Johns takes the title of his journal from a work he greatly
admired,
Williams's
autobiographical novel <I>A Voyage to Pagany </I>. But
whereas
Williams's
Pagany is of course Europe, the "pagan" Old World where
American innocents
come
to be initiated into the complexities of a sophisticated
culture, Johns's
Pagany,
as the journal's subtitle, "A Native Quarterly," makes
clear, neatly
reverses
this Jamesian contrast between Old and New Worlds. In the
announcement on
the
opening page of the first issue (January-March 1930), Johns
explains:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
<I>Pagus </I>is a broad term, meaning any sort of collection
of peoples
from the
smallest district or village to the country as an inclusive
whole. Taking
America
as the <I>pagus, </I>any one of us as the <I>paganus,
</I>the inhabitant,
and our
conceptions, our agreements and disagreements, our ideas,
ideals, whatever
we
have to articulate is <I>pagany, </I>our expression.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This <I>Native Quarterly </I>is representative of a diverse
and ungrouped
body of
spokesmen, bound geographically. Wary of definite alliance
with any
formulated
standard <I>PAGANY </I>(as an enclosure) includes individual
expression of
native
thought     and emotion.
<sup><a NAME="REF10"
HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup><!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Here, by an odd
sleight-of-hand, <I>Pagany </I>(Europe) becomes the "diverse
and ungrouped
body
of spokesmen" that is America. From the exotic and corrupt
European Other
to the
cultural diversity of the United States: it is an emblem of
the shift from
the
expatriate 1920s to the American 1930s, a shift that the
journal will
trace.
Interestingly, when foreign writers (the English Mary Butts,
the French
Georges
Hugnet) or artists (the French Eug&egrave;ne Atget) are
included, their
work is
mediated by a specific American sponsor: Butts by Ezra
Pound, Hugnet by
Gertrude
Stein and Virgil Thomson, Atget by Berenice Abbott.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
The
first issue
of <I>Pagany, </I>for example, contains Butts's short story
"The House
Party,"
which gives the Jamesian initiation-into-Europe motif a
sardonic twist.
The hero
Paul is an American "joy-boy," "a cracked little specimen of
a gigolo,
after a
year in prison for something he had not done," who is
invited by a worldly
Englishman named Vincent to a house party in a "sea-washed,
fly-blown,
scorched
hotel along the coast":
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Under Vincent's wing, a man
could stand up a bit.
Vincent was English,
tender,
serious, older than he was. Vincent wanted him to come. Was
no doubt
cajoling,
hypnotizing certain objections. Objections that were always
made about him,
especially by his own countrymen, the Americans who made a
cult of Europe,
a cult
and a career, not quite perfect in their transplanting
and
conscious of it.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Like the Zukofsky whom Williams criticized for "forcing
abstract
conceptions into
the sound pattern," Butts produces a prose notable for its
calculated
imprecision, its 

<B></B>

 verbal and syntactic
oddities. "Under Vincent's wing, a
man
could stand up a bit": the sentence begins with a familiar
clich&eacute;,
only to
deflate it with an absurd description: how does one stand up
under
someone's
"wing"? Then, too, "a man could stand up a bit" alludes to
Ford Madox
Ford's 1926
<I>A Man Could Stand Up </I>(the third volume of the
<I>Parade's End
</I>tetralogy), a novel Butts surely knew. Is she saying
that Paul's is,
in its
own way, a life in the trenches not wholly unlike that of
Christopher
Tietjens?
It is hard to tell, Butts's mode being pastiche in Fredric
Jameson's sense
of
"blank parody," parody "devoid . . . of any conviction that
alongside the
abnormal tongue you have momentarily borrowed, some healthy
linguistic
normality
still exists."
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Vincent, we read further, was "no doubt
cajoling,
hypnotizing certain objections." Again the shift from a
Victorian
construction
("no doubt cajoling") to the odd application of hypnosis to,
not persons,
but
abstract nouns referring to mental states. In a similar
vein, the energy
of the
European hosts is said to be "virgin" and Paul's
"adventures" are
characterized
not by their kind but by their "directions." The simile "his
adventures
out-numbered theirs as the stars the dim electric light
bulbs of the
hotel" calls
attention to the willed extravagance of Butts's style, her
refusal of
structural
coherence in favor of disjunction and dislocation. As she
puts it in the
opening
of "Brightness Falls," "There is no head or tail to this
story, except
that it
happened. On the other hand, how does one know that anything
happened? How
does
one know?"
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Or take the opening of "The Warning": "This
happened in
the kind of house people live in who used not to live in
that kind of
house, who
were taught to have very distinct opinions about the kind of
people who
lived in
them. Yet, now that they have gone to live in them, they are
rather
different
than when the other sort of person lived there."
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The
similarity to
Stein should not be surprising; Butts knew Stein through her
close friend
Virgil
Thomson and had frequented Stein's Paris salon. The first
issue of
<I>Pagany,
</I>for that matter, contains Stein's "Five Words in a Line"
(later
incorporated
into <I>Stanzas in Meditation </I>[1932]), which begins:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In his essay "The Work of Gertrude Stein," which follows
"Five Words in a
Line,"
Williams remarks, "Having taken the words to her choice . .
. [Stein] has
completely unlinked them from their former relationships in
the sentence .
. . .
The words, in writing, she discloses, transcend everything."
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Most
poets, Williams reminds the reader, take the easy way out:
"Starting from
scratch
we get, possibly, thatch; just as they have always done in
poetry. Then
they
would try to connect it up by something like--The mice
scratch, beneath the
thatch. Miss Stein does away with all that. The
free-versists on the
contrary
used nothing else. They saved--The mice, under the . . . "
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
Reading Williams's essay, as one normally does, in <I>A
Novelette and
Other Prose
</I> or, together with his "A 1 Pound Stein" ,
in the
<I>Selected
Essays,</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
one assumes that Stein's was a case wholly
exceptional,
that no one else at the time was so thoroughly "unlinking"
words from their
normal syntactic relationships. But reading Williams's essay
in the
context of
<I>Pagany </I>suggests that Stein's "unlinkings," like the
syntactic
oddities,
abstractions, and ungainly compoundings (e.g.,
"orbit-trembling") of
Zukofsky,
which Williams had called into question, were not all that
exceptional in
the
writing of the early 1930s. Indeed, Stein's free adaptation
of Georges
Hugnet's
surrealist poetic suite <I>Enfances, </I>which appeared in
the
January-March
issue of <I>Pagany, </I>provides an interesting index to the
new poetics.

English version on facing pages, has a complicated history
that needn't
preoccupy
us here;
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
suffice it to say that, according to the original
plan,
<I>Enfances, </I>together with Stein's "reflection," as she
called her
version,
was to be published in Paris by &Eacute;ditions Jeanne
Bucher, with
illustrations
by Picasso, Louis Marcoussis, and Pavel Tchelitcheff. But
when Hugnet
objected
that Stein's version could not be considered a translation
of his poem, she
responded by giving the text printed in <I>Pagany </I>the
title "Poem
Pritten on
Pfances of Georges Hugnet."
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
When she brought out the book
version
later that year, Stein eliminated the French text altogether
and called
her own
poem <I>Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship
Faded.</I>

<p>
Stein's "free translation" of Hugnet's <I>Enfance </I>has
been roundly
criticized. Richard Bridgman says it "suffers badly in the
presence of the
original which it purports to reflect . . . . Stein's
liberties were so
extreme
that, did they not emanate from her, one might reasonably
conclude that the
translator knew too little French to do the job properly . .
. . [S]he
carefully
censored Hugnet's images of death, sex, nudity, and onanism.
For a woman
who
offered lines of fearsomely coy sexual innuendo, Gertrude
Stein remained,
even in
her middle fifties, prudish, or at least evasive."
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
And even
Marianne DeKoven, who celebrates Stein's experimental
writing, remarks,
"Unfortunately, she seems to equate the essence of poetry
with the way
many poems
sound, and instead of illuminating abstraction she achieves
only travesty
. . . .
Much of the painfully unassimilated 'poetic' diction in
Stein's poem is
the trace
of the French original."
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
Note how similar this charge against Stein is to Williams's
complaint about
Zukofsky's "stilted 'poetic'" language and his "forcing of
abstract
conceptions
into the sound pattern." It is a modernist-based critique of
a new way of
writing
that came to be known by the curiously inappropriate label
"Objectivist."
Consider stanza 12 of Hugnet's <I>Enfances: </I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

My hunger is great, my appetite without bounds.

I can speak for a long time without voicing slander 

<B></B>

but everything hurts me and I know how to hate,

This country which I see for the first time
<BR>
entrusts to my timidity the preparations for the trip,
<BR>
all that an absence can produce from uncertainty
<BR>
all that surprise can do to replace love,
<BR>
and it is so great that I think of my pride
<BR>
that no regret for the humiliations suffered for you
<BR>
can make my childhood fear the night,
<BR>
the night and these gifts you have bestowed on me,
<BR>
these gifts on which your indifference is tattooed
<BR>
beneath the shape and the song of a particular look.
<BR>
Childhood, I place you at the center of the world,
<BR>
to the center of my heart, you place yourself
<BR>
you choose the path commensurate with my hunger,
<BR>
homicidal childhood commensurate with my hunger.

<p>
Hugnet's seventeen-line lyric celebrates, in rather
melodramatic and
strained
terms, the secret pleasures of childhood masturbation. Its
formal
alexandrines,
occasionally rhyming, give the poem a Baudelairean cast,
even as its theme
recalls the self-absorption of Hugnet's friend Jean Cocteau.
Stein's
"reflection"
on Hugnet's "love" poem is wonderfully droll:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
I am very hungry when I drink, I need to leave it when I
have it held.
They will
be white with which they know they see, that darker makes it
be a color

me, white is not shown when I am dark indeed with red
despair who comes
who has
to care that they will let me a little lie like now I like
to lie I like
to live
I like to die I like to lie and live and die and live and
die and by and
by I
like to live and die and by and by the need to sew, the
difference is that
sewing
makes it bleed and such with them in all the way of seed and
seeding and
repine
and they will which is mine and not all mine who can be
thought curious of

sit upon

without which
it has
been not been born. Oh no not to be thirsty with the thirst
of hunger not
alone
to know that they plainly and ate or wishes. Any little one
will kill
himself
    for milk.

<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Contrary to Bridgman's supposition, Stein has obviously read
her Hugnet
carefully. Indeed, her witty pastiche of his masturbatory
lyric takes all
his
references into account: extreme hunger and despair, the
thirst for life
punctuated by fear of death, the fidelity to one's ideals
and refusal to
betray
them, the contrast between a virginal white and the red of
penetration,
and the
infantile regression to the nursing state. Then, too, Stein
makes as much
as
Hugnet does of repetition and even one-ups him at rhyming:
"They will be
white
with which they know they see, / that darker makes it be a
color white for
me,"
"when I am dark indeed with red despair / who comes who has
to care," and
so on.
But Stein goes much further: her own poem modulates a
complex series of
monosyllables containing long and short i's ("I like to lie
I like to live
I like
to die I like to lie and live and die and live and die and
by and by . . .
."),
creating a singsong nursery-rhyme rhythm that expresses
<I>"enfance"
</I>via
sound rather 

<B></B>

 than imagery. In this
playful network, every phoneme counts:
"lie"
becomes "live" with the addition of one consonant, and the
"it" of line 2
("I
need to leave it when I have it held") changes meaning with
every new
phrase.
Finally, the hyperbole of "thirsty with the thirst of
hunger" playfully
acknowledges Hugnet's "&agrave; l'exemple de ma faim," even
as parts of
speech
are unlinked from their normal position ("not alone to know
that they
plainly and
ate or wishes"). And the poem concludes on a commonsense
note that truly
does
characterize infancy: "Any little one will kill himself for
milk."

<p>
One might object at this point that, whatever Stein's
relation to Hugnet
and his
poetic sequence, her version of stanza 12 should be
understood as a
characteristic Stein work, one text among many similar ones
like, say,
<I>Tender
Buttons </I>or <I>A Long Gay Book, </I>both written almost
two decades
earlier.
But however familiar the repetition, the reduced vocabulary,
and skewed
grammar,
the Stein of the 1910s and early 1920s was not as given to
parody and
allusive
literary play as is the author of "Poem Pritten on Pfances
of Georges
Hugnet."
The early portraits like "Picasso" and "Mabel Dodge at the
Villa Curonia"
manifest a care for consistency that we don't find here or
in the great
poem of
this period, "Stanzas in Meditation." Abstraction,
intertextuality, the
dispersal
of the subject, obsessive rhyming and related sound
patterning--these
become
Stein's signature. Blood, in her scheme of things, is
associated, not with
Hugnet's wound of love but with what are obliquely presented
as her
preferred
domestic activities. Sewing ("the difference is that sewing
makes it
bleed")
modulates slyly via the rhyme "bleed" / "seed" into the
onanism Bridgman
takes
Stein to have ignored. "All the way to seed and seeding and
repine and
they will
which is mine and not at all mine": these words constitute
Stein's covert
tribute
to Alice Toklas and her witty exposure of Hugnet's vaunted
self-absorption. "Know
it for ripeness," as she archly puts it, "without deserting
all of it."

<p>
From the vantage point of high modernism, such writing was
bound to appear
deficient: no "direct treatment of the thing," no objective
correlative,
no clear
visual images. Stein's "deliberate gracelessness" -- the
phrase is Peter
Quartermain's in reference to Mina Loy
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
-- may also be linked
to the
new form of transgression of conventional gender roles, a
transgression
that goes
hand-in-hand with the social uncertainties of the early
Depression years.
The
July-September 1931 issue of <I>Pagany, </I>for example,
contains Loy's
"Lady
Laura in Bohemia," which begins:

<p>
"Lady Laura in Bohemia" is perhaps best understood as a late
modernist
sendup of
Eliot's "Portrait of a Lady," of Pound's "Portrait d'une
Femme," and
section 12
of <I>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley </I>("The Lady Valentine"). The
swans of Loy's
poem
are no longer Yeats's "brilliant creatures," drifting
mysteriously on
Coole lake
but a "circus" of debutantes, "trained" to behave according
to the norms
of their
"genealogical tree." "Trained," the opening word in the
poem, places
emphasis on
social and cultural control, an emphasis underscored by the
poem's rhythm,
which
is much closer to the "sequence of a metronome" than to that
of the
"musical
phrase" ("R," 3) Pound advocated so strenuously. Take the
lines

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Her eliminate flesh of fashion
<BR>
inseparable from the genealogical tree . . . .
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Here the rhymes "she" / "recedingly" / "tree" are
intentionally silly,
forcing
the reader to stress the last syllable of "recedingly" and
run
"genealogical" and
"tree" together. More important, Loy's structures of
modification are
characterized by repeated grammatical oddities: Laura
"proceeds
recedingly," her
"flesh" is "eliminate" (rather than "eliminated") and it
"columns" a
"towering
reticence / of lifted chin." In line 12, the abstract noun
"regret" is
described
as "inebriate" or drunk. In line 13, Lady Laura's "caste" is
defined as
"vertical," and the quotation in line 14 is not attributed
to anyone in
particular. It could be Lady Laura's exclamation, but then
again it could
be that
of a bystander in the "Bohemian" night club, or even the
words of the poet
herself.

<p>
Once one accustoms oneself to the curious coupling of
abstract and
concrete words
in Loy's poetry, her language begins to resonate. The
opening describes
the
entrance of a well-brought up and aristocratic young woman
("Trained in a
circus
of swans") into a Montparnasse bar (a later couplet reads
"her hell is /
Zelli's"
["LL," 126])--an entrance made "recedingly," with mock
unobtrusiveness and
tiny,
graceful steps. In keeping with the fashion and her
"genealogical tree,"
her
flesh is "eliminate"--she is properly sleek and slim. But
she carries
herself so
upright that her "lifted chin" and demure demeanor give her
an air of
"towering
reticence" as she "columns" her way into the room. Drunk
though she may
be, her
hiccoughs are beautifully disguised as little bows: she
might be
curtseying to
the queen. Her "descent / into the half-baked underworld" of
Bohemia is
not so
much a fall as a "somersault," which is to say that women of
Laura's
"vertical
caste" always bounce back, no matter 

<B></B>

how great their "inebriate regret."
Her
behavior, in other words, is dictated by birth and caste, in
sharp
contrast to
those whose "cradle" has been the "curb."

<p>
What Loy has produced, then, is a sardonic cartoon of
caf&eacute; society,
the
poetic equivalent of a George Grosz cabaret scene. Yet it is
composed of
the most
minimal strokes; no visual picture of the characters or the
setting ever
fully
emerges. People are defined by synecdoches: Laura <I>is
</I>the eliminate
flesh
of fashion, the column of towering reticence, and so on. And
when metaphor
is
used, it is invariably sardonic, as in the final line of the
poem, "She is
yet
like a diamond on a heap of broken glass" ("LL," 126). There
is nothing
diamond-like about this "memorable divorc&eacute;e" ("LL,"
126) who was
"christened by the archbishop of Canterbury" ("LL," 125).
Only in a "heap
of
broken glass" can she sparkle momentarily. And even this
reference has a
double
entendre, Loy no doubt alluding playfully to the "heap of
broken images" in
<I>The Waste Land.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Eliot parodies, for that matter, were
common
in this period: in the same volume of <I>Pagany, </I>Butts
has a poem
called
"Thinking of Saints and of Petronius Arbiter" (the title
comes from
Yeats's elegy
for Mabel Beardsley, "Upon a Dying Lady") that contains this
parody of "The
Hollow Men":

<p>
Logopoeia: arch, hard-edged, tough-minded, slightly nasty.
For both Loy and
Butts, extravagant verbal play is more important than the
Poundian demand
for
accuracy and precision. But what is especially odd is that
even the
so-called
realistic fiction, most of it by men, found in the pages of
<I>Pagany--</I>a
fiction I now turn too--displays a taste for the
grotesquerie and
self-parody we
find in the work of Stein, Loy, and Butts.

In the chill frost of winter I left Memphis and rode on the
outside of
freight
cars all the way to the Atlantic. The nights were so cold
that my fingers
froze
around the iron bars and at daybreak each morning I had to
bite them away
with my
teeth. The joints of my fingers broke sometimes when I bit
them from the
iron and
the flesh      cracked to the bone like
the deep cut of
a sharp
knife. When I got to Charleston I worked all night in a
dairy and drank
the warm
foam of the new white milk and all day I sat in my room at

<p>
Realistic autobiographical narrative in the vein of Sherwood
Anderson or
Ring
Lardner? A naturalistic picture of the seamy side of life in
the
poverty-stricken
rural South? It begins that way, with the references to
Memphis and
Charleston,
the hopping of freight trains and fingers frozen to the iron
window bars.
But the
second section, with its distinction between the "Men who
worked with
their hands
and backs," (note the erotic double entendre in the
apparently blunt
statement)
and "those with soft damp fingers" seems oddly gratuitous in
the context.
The
strong and the weak? The studs and the pansies? What, one
wonders, does
this
seemingly homophobic dismissal have to do with the
narrator's quest, which
leads
him to pursue "the quick beauty of a girl's face" seen in a
crowd and
stunning
enough to be blinding. "As soon as I could see again I
looked and saw a
scar on
my eyes. The scar was an etching of the beauty I had seen
and when tears
had
tried but could not wash its lines away I saw it framed in
colors like the
rainbow" ("H," 2).

<p>
The image of the scar across the eyes has a surrealistic
cast (one thinks
of Max
Ernst's 1929 <I>La femme 100 t&ecirc;tes</I>) at odds with
the hard-boiled
narrative of passages like "I walked into the country again
and worked
among
negroes on a farm. The white man made us sweat from sun-up
till dark and
he would
not let us stop for a drink of water" ("H," 2). A similar
equivocation
between
surrealism and naturalism occurs later:

Such writing has usually been classified as "literature of
social
protest," with
the horrific narrative providing, in flat, objective manner,
a graphic
image of
white oppression and black victimization. Short declarative
sentences,
reductive
vocabulary, lack of involvement of the speaking subject:
these are what
one might
expect from the author of "Hours Before 

<B></B>

 Eternity," who happens to be
Erskine
Caldwell, the best-selling Southern "naturalist" author of
<I>Tobacco Road
</I> and <I>God's Little Acre </I>. The young
Communist went
on to
visit Russia with his then-wife Margaret Bourke-White and
wrote the text
for her
book of documentary photographs <I>You Have Seen Their Faces
</I>,
later
becoming increasingly conservative, a "sell-out" to
Hollywood, relegated
today to
the company of forgotten white male writers of the period.
Even James E.
Devlin,
who wrote the 1984 Twayne book on Caldwell, concludes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

He is without any question a minor writer, and further, a
limited one.
Philosophically he is of few ideas and those often
inconsistent. He has
never
decided whether it is the heart or the head to which he owes
the greater
allegiance. His belief in feeling, intuition, and emotion as
God-directed
often
falters when opposed by the strong pressure of a
naturalistic determinism
that
also guides his thought. About sexual passion he is
simultaneously
knowledgeable
and as innocent as Steve Henderson, the wooden

They contain a kind of aphoristic rhetoric, except that the
aphorisms are
less
ideas than tiny plots . . . . The swift segments shunt us
back and forth

brutality and wistfulness. Perhaps the grandiose, the
violent, and the
gentle
qualities of the piece are all fused in this bit of purest
poetry: "Once
the sun
was so hot a bird came down and walked beside me in my
shadow." A section
in
Pagany containing this item was the first thing by Caldwell
I ever saw.
For days
I was noisy in my enthusiasm -- but I could not understand
how it went
with some
of his other work.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In trying to understand his own reaction, Burke suggests
that Caldwell's
"cult of
incongruity" ("C," 352) results from a "balked religiosity,"
channelled
into
"political exhortation," the resulting perspective being not
so much
complex in
the modernist sense as wilfully contradictory. His
"particular aptitude
has been
in scrambling or garbling properties," a "deft way of
putting the wrong
things
together" ("C," 351-52). For Devlin, such inconsistency is
ipso facto a
fault,
but for Burke, proto-postmodernist that he is, irresolution
has a positive
side.
What he likes about "Hours Before 

<B></B>

 Eternity" is
that the text
"muddl[es] our
judgments instead of stabilizing them" ("C," 353). Such
withholding on the
author's part, he posits, "is the subtlest feature of
Caldwell's method.
Where
the author leaves out so much, the reader begins making up
the difference
for
himself. Precisely by omitting humaneness where humaneness
is most called
for, he
may stimulate the reader to supply it" ("C," 355). And he
concludes, "I
have
denied that Caldwell is a realist. In his tomfoolery he
comes closer to the
Dadaists; when his grotesqueness is serious, he is a
Superrealist," a poet
of
<I>"nonrational </I>linkages" and "fantastic
simplifications" ("C,"
356-57).

<p>
"Fantastic simplification" is a good term, not only for
Caldwell's fiction
but
also for much of the work published in <I>Pagany </I>and in
such related
journals
as <I>Blues </I>and <I>Contact. </I>"Dada" and
"Superrealist" (surrealist)
may
not be quite the defining terms for "Hours Before Eternity,"
for the
dadaists
would never have produced sentences so sober and realistic
as: "He handed
me a
cup of flour and a piece of fat meat and a few potatoes and
gave me
permission to
use his cooking stove" ("H," 3), and the surrealists were
much more
programmatic
and Freudian. Rather, Caldwell's "deft way of putting the
wrong things
together"
depends upon a curious undercutting of the authority of the
subject. The
tone is
so uncertain, shifting as it does from caricature to pathos,
from a racy
humor to
a grim earnestness, that, in Burke's words, "it muddl[es]
our judgments
instead
of stabilizing them." In a paragraph like section XV above,
for example,
the
curious and confusing use of personal pronouns (thirty-one
in nine
sentences)
distances the reader from the terrible events, "him" and
"her" becoming,
in one
sense, so many counters on a chessboard.

<p>
Such distancing "Superrealism" would seem to be a homegrown
product, quite
appropriate for the pages of a "Native Quarterly." Indeed
the "nonrational
linkages" and "fantastic abstractions" Burke speaks of, as
well as the
predilection to parody, play, contradiction, and the
undercutting of
mimesis
despite referential overload, can be seen as a kind of
signature of
literary
discourse in Depression America. Take Edward Dahlberg's
autobiographical
narrative "Graphophone Nickelodeon Days," which immediately
follows
Stein's "Poem
Pritten on Pfances" in the January-March 1931 issue of
<I>Pagany.</I>

<p>
Like Caldwell, Dahlberg is now a largely forgotten writer;
his name is not
even
listed in the 1988 <I>Columbia Literary History of the
United States.
</I>If he
is remembered at all, it is largely for the role he played
as mentor to
the young
Charles Olson.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
But again like Caldwell, when read against
texts by
Stein and Williams in the pages of <I>Pagany, </I>Dahlberg
emerges as by

where "blakean" is a self-conscious intervention into the

as is the subsequent interjection of the song lyric,
<I>"casy jones got

Is the publication in <I>Pagany </I>of Dahlberg's prose an
anomaly? I
think that
on the contrary this text, like Caldwell's "Hours before
Eternity,"
provides a
matrix for Zukofsky's early "Objectivist" poetry that may
well be more
telling
than the usual placement of that poetry in the
Pound-Williams tradition.
Take,
for example, Zukofsky's "Four Poems" ("Buoy," "Awake," "Blue
light is the
night
harbor-slip," and 

<B></B>

 "Passing tall")
published alongside Dahlberg's
"Graphophone
Nickelodeon Days," Stein's "Poem Pritten on Pfances," and
Butts's
"Thinking of
Saints." With the exception of "Awake," these poems, written
between 1925
and
1931, were included in "29 Poems."

<p>
Williams was surely right in telling Zukofsky that his early
poems had not
been
"objectivized in new or fresh observations." Zukofsky's
break with what
Burton
Hatlen has called a "late Imagist" "poetics of presence," a
poetics in
which
"words remain absolutely faithful to 'things' in their
sensory immediacy,"
is
incontrovertible, but I am not sure it follows that "if the
seeable is by
definition unsayable, then language, rather than giving us
Being in its
fullness,
must reconcile itself to the more difficult task of enacting
our endless
and
endlessly frustrated struggle <I>toward </I>Being."
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
For like
the
Stein of "Poems Pritten on Pfances" or the Loy of "Lady
Laura of Bohemia,"
the
Zukofsky of "Buoy" foregrounds the play of the signifier,
especially
paragram and
pun. "Buoy--no, how": the first line puns on "Boy--know
how," "know-how"
being
the great trait in 1930s technological America. "Boy, what
know-how!": like
George Oppen's Frigidaire poem published in the
"Objectivist" number of
<I>Poetry
</I>("Thus / Hides the / Parts"), Zukofsky is examining a
world in which
coherent natural images--a buoy at sea as a <I>point de
rep&egrave;re
</I>for
incoming freighters--have been replaced by floating
signifiers. "It is not
a
question" of asking what "this freighter [is] carrying," or
even where the
smoke
is coming from or who blew the whistle. Since "commerce will
not complete /
Anything," there are no meaningful images, only a "complete
fragment"--but
"Of"
what? Evidently "Of -- / Nothing."

<p>
The second stanza urges us to "look" at "that gull / Streak
the water!"
But this
is not the world of Hart Crane's "Bridge," composed in these
same years,
where
the "seagull's wings shall dip and pivot him, / Over the
chained bay water
Liberty."
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
No "apparitional" white gulls as emblems of
transcendence. "Getting nearer are we," asks the poet.
"Hear?" (again with
a pun
on "here"). And then, in what is a statement of poetics, we
read, "count
the
dissonances." And dissonances are what we live with. 

<B></B>

 The following
question,
"Shoal?," suggests that there is no coherent picture to be
composed of this
harbor scene; no line of demarcation between shore or shoal
and water can
be
shown. Images "accost" us, but "accost" contains within it
the word
"cost," and
this in turn suggests the "Cost accounting" of the final
line. "Commerce"
is what
it's really all about; money is the "buoy" or marker around
which the
"busy"
harbor traffic revolves. But--and I think this is
important--the poem is
not at
all polemical about this state of affairs; its focus is on
the ironic
potential
of words to "mean" differently when they are "unlinked" from
their usual
contexts. No pretty harbor scene with freighters in the
distance sailing
between
the buoys. "Count-cost-accost-account": the cost of
accounting, the
accosting
(accounting) of costs: the play is Steinian in its wit.

<p>
Then, too, the lineation of "Buoy" obliquely pokes fun at
the imagist
free-verse
lyric. Much has been made of Zukofsky's musical virtuosity,
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
but it
is useful to remember that his soundscapes exist at the
micro- rather than
the
macrolevel of lyric form, a poem like "Buoy" modulating long
o's ("no,"
"smoke,"
"blow") and <I>iy </I>diphthongs ("Streak," "nearer," "we,"
"hear") with
great
ingenuity, even as its individual lines are purposely
flat-footed. "Buoy
-- no,
how": three stresses on monosyllables, separated by
punctuation: hardly an
attractive line. The next two are similar:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
To call these lines "prosaic" would still not convey the
oppositional,
anti-poetic stance of the young Zukofsky, his aggressive
challenge to the
reader
to "count the dissonances." Surely "Objectivist," with its
connotations of
materiality, is a curious label for a lyric so
uncompromising and so
self-destructive.

I have been arguing that the poetics of the early 1930s
produced an
adversarial
literature that called into question the pieties of an
earlier, more
innocent
modernism by means of powerful wit, complex parody,
contradiction of
formal and
emotional registers, and especially the dissolution of the
coherent "lyric
voice"
as a controlling presence in the poetic text. The
sentimental slides into
the
cynical and back again. Reference, moreover, does not insure
mimetic
representation. Nothing is taken for granted; nothing is
quite what it
seems to
be.

This can be seen even in the photographs of the period. In
the
January-March 1931
issue of <I>Pagany, </I>we find, side by side with
Dahlberg's fiction and
Zukofsky's poetry, four reproductions of Eug&egrave;ne Atget
photographs,
evidently transmitted to the editor by Berenice Abbott, of
whom more in a
moment.
Atget's astonishing images of shop windows, arcades,
doorways, and street
corners, most of them curiously empty of people, are at once
documentary
and
surrealistic, their lighting and angle shots endowing the
most ordinary
scenes--a
dressmaker's dummy in a shop 

<B></B>

 window, a
display of stuffed animals, a
puppet-theatre curtain, or monkey house in the park (<a

1-4</a>)--with a
dreamlike
presence, rather as Zukofsky's "buoy" or Williams's "back
wings of the
hospital"
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
become part of a language game. Furthermore, the
fabled
breakdown of the divide between "high" and "low" art
attributed to
postmodernism
is taken for granted in these prints, where the mundane is
inseparable
from the
emphasis on formal composition.

Thousands of the negatives Atget had made prior to his death
in 1927, at a
time
when his work was virtually unknown, were rescued and
printed by Berenice
Abbott,
four of whose own photographs appear in the next issue of
<I>Pagany.
</I>Having
returned to America as part of the expatriate exodus from
Paris in 1929,
Abbott
wanted to do for New York what Atget had done for Paris. In
particular, she
wanted to provide a documentary record of urban
transformation: the
demolition of
old buildings to make way for the new skyscrapers, the
surviving
neighborhood
shops, the relation of technology to nature, stone and steel
to sky (<a href=2.1perloff_res.html>.
5-8</a>).
Like Atget's, her images are only superficially instances of
documentary
realism,
their strange placement and surprising juxtapositions of
materials
creating a
landscape as surreal as Caldwell's mysterious Southern
sites.

<p>
The 1931 volume, which featured these photographs as well as
Charles
Demuth's
similarly stylized watercolor illustrations for James's
<I>The Turn of the
Screw,
</I>side-by-side with the poetry of Williams and the fiction
of Dahlberg
and Dos
Passos, was thus a triumph for <I>Pagany. </I>But the
following year,
things
began to unravel. True, Richard Johns was still discovering
new (or new
for him)
authors: the January-March 1932 issue had a long poem
("Brown River,
Smile") by
Jean Toomer, whose <I>Cane </I>Johns had long admired, as
well as a first
appearance ("Electra-Orestes") by H. D. But the journal's
financial
situation had
become precarious.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Often, Johns couldn't afford to pay his
authors,
much less the print shop, and the quality of production went
down. To make
things
worse, a number of accidents (including a fire) caused
manuscripts to be
destroyed. The October-December 1932 issue was thus delayed
and didn't
come out
until February 1933. This was <I>Pagany</I>'s final issue.

<p>
The usual explanation for such endings is that the modernist
avant-garde
could
not survive the Depression, that it gave way to a more
socially conscious,
more
politicized "writing on the Left," as it came to be called.
In his moving
introduction to Stephen Halpert's <I>Return to PAGANY
</I>, for
example,
Kenneth Rexroth, whose own poetry was featured in the pages
of Zukofsky's
<I>"Objectivists" Anthology </I>and Charles Henri Ford's
<I>Blues, </I>as
well as
in the first issue of <I>Pagany, </I>put it this way:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
<I>Pagany</I>'s lifetime spanned the breakdown of the
international avant
garde
as the world economic crisis shut down and a quite different
kind of
literature
emerged . . . . Under the pressure of catastrophe, writers
and artists all
over
the world began to turn to attack the specific social evils
from which
they had
thought they had escaped by concentrating on the underlying,
fundamental
Lie.
Richard Johns was especially sensitive to
 this great
turn,
and published some of the earliest and finest writing of the
kind that was
eventually to be debauched and destroyed by the slogans of
falsification --
Proletcult and Socialist Realism. [<I>ARP</I>, xiii, xv]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
 

<B></B>

<p>
But this is not quite the way it happened. For one thing,
the poetry of the
Objectivists, as of Loy and Butts, and of the Stein and
Williams of the
1930s,
was already quite different in mood and rhetoric from the
more utopian
work of
the early modernists. Picasso's <I>Ma Jolie</I> , for
example, was,
for all
its cubist fragmentation and complexity, still a highly
painterly work, a
portrait, after all, of a lady, whereas it isn't clear that
Abbott's
"documentary" studies of barbershop storefronts, sandwiched
between newer
steel
and concrete structures, are "art" at all. A similar
contrast can be found
between <I>Ulysses </I>and Dos Passos's <I>U.S.A., </I>whose
"Eveline"
sequence
appeared in the summer and autumn 1931 issues of
<I>Pagany.</I>

<p>
Secondly, the umbrella term "social protest literature"
obscures some
important
distinctions. Like Rexroth himself, the Objectivist poets
were certainly
"writers
on the Left" (George Oppen is perhaps the most striking
example of the
poet who,
as onetime Communist party member, had to go underground
during the
McCarthy
years), but the Left was itself curiously divided when it
came to
questions of
aesthetic. 

<B></B>

 Consider the
July-September 1932 issue of <I>Pagany, </I>which
features the "First Movement" (to become book I) of
Zukofsky's monumental
poem
<I>"A." </I>The well-known opening, which provides us with
the title of
the poem,
its first word, and the note musicians tune by, all the
while using the
separation of the indefinite article ("A") from the noun
("round") it
modifies to
create a pun on the preposition "around," immediately calls
into question
the
authority of the lyric speaker:

occasion an Easter

</I>with phrases
from the
oratorio punctuating

 the narrator's
account. And even these phrases become
the
subject of the poet's play, with <I>"See Him! Whom?" </I>and
<I>"See Him!
How?"
</I>referring to the audience's alienation from the
Christian ethos of the
<I>Passion. </I>"First Movement" now submits these motifs to
a complex
"musical"
development that partly echoes, partly ironizes Bach's own
music; it ends
with
bits of conversation overheard on the street after the
concert:

<p>
This voice (evidently of a wealthy industrialist) is
punctuated by the
words of
the <I>Passion ("Ye lightnings, ye thunders / In clouds are
ye vanished"),
</I>which in their turn modulate into a concluding line
("Open, O fierce
flaming
pit!" ["FM," 13]) that refers, not only to the oratorio from
which it
comes, but
also to the poet's own sense of hell inherent in the
contrast between the
musical
discourse of Bach and the discourse of the city in which his
<I>Passion
</I>is
heard, or rather goes unheard.

<p>
Coming upon this after reading Butts and Loy, Stein and
Zukofsky, the
reader may
well be confused. Is this a late poem by Arthur Symons?
Ernest Dowson? John
Davidson? The voice that speaks in neatly rhyming <I>abba
</I>quatrains is
in
total control, able to speak for a larger "we," a "we" who
are somehow
(how?)
"unborn" and "unknowing," waiting for the miracle at Delphi
to occur.
Predictably
the lanes are "muted," their shadows "aflame," their "terror
muffled."
Everything
is vague, shadowy, disembodied, melancholy. But why and how?

<p>
The author of this poem, Edwin Rolfe, was a Communist and
activist, a poet
and
fiction writer as well as a journalist who appeared
frequently in <I>The
New
Masses </I>and <I>The Daily Worker, </I>and was to serve, in
1937, in the
Abraham
Lincoln Brigade and write a volume of poems about the
Spanish Civil War.
Rolfe,
writes Cary Nelson,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
is one of the politically committed poets whose work largely
meets New
Critical
standards for producing formally coherent, metaphorically
inventive, fully
realized, and self-sufficient poems. That he is almost
wholly excluded
from our
cultural memory 

<B></B>

 demonstrates that
political -- not merely purportedly
disinterested aesthetic -- criteria have helped determine
what poets we
honor in
our texts and literary histories.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
But it is not clear what Nelson means by terms like
"formally coherent,"
"self-sufficient," or "aesthetic." In point of fact, Rolfe's
latter-day
Yellow
Nineties mode
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
would certainly not meet "New Critical
standards," and
not because of the poet's political stance; rather, a critic
like Cleanth
Brooks
or Allen Tate would have complained of the laxity of the
poem's diction
and the
self-indulgence of its tone. Indeed, it is time we stopped
pitting the
ostensible
"radicalism" of poets like Rolfe against "New Critical"
"conservatism" and
compare it instead to the very different Left radicalism of
the
Objectivists,
whose work was at least as neglected by, say, Brooks and
Tate as was
Rolfe's.

"Use absolutely no word," Pound had cautioned in a statement

one, took very seriously, "that does not contribute to the

shells,"
but without Eliot's irony. Farrell's words, especially his
adjectives, are
nothing if not predictable: t-clubs are "stale,"
dressing rooms
"clammy,"
gyms "lousy," saloons "ratty," and bed sheets "filthy." And
the passage's
heavy
repetition (the anaphora of "Fifteen years . . . ") does not
exactly make
for a
dynamic rhythm.

<p>
Oddly enough, then, this vein of "proletarian" writing
bypassed modernism,
returning to the genteel tradition of a previous generation.
The split
between
the aesthetic and the political, a split that had threatened
the life of
the
avant-garde from 

<B></B>

 the time of its
inception in the later nineteenth
century, had
now widened to a large fissure. The "radical political" wing
associated
with
Edwin Rolfe and James Farrell was quickly co-opted by the
Establishment.
In the
winter of 1934, exactly one year after the last issue of
<I>Pagany </I>was
published, the <I>Partisan Review </I>put out its first
issue. Subtitled "A
Bi-Monthly of Revolutionary Literature," <I>Partisan Review
</I>was the
official
organ of the John Reed Club of New York (a cell of the
American Communist
Party)
until 1937 when, in response to the Moscow Show Trials, the
magazine
severed its
Party connections. The editorial in the first issue states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We propose to concentrate on creative and critical
literature, but we shall
maintain a definite viewpoint -- that of the revolutionary
working class.
Through
our specific literary medium we shall participate in the
struggle of the
workers
and sincere intellectuals against imperialist war, fascism,
national and
racial
oppression, and for the abolition of the system which breeds
these evils.
The
defense of the Soviet Union is one of our principal tasks.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The issue opens with two short stories about social
injustice by Grace
Lumpkin,
but otherwise its contributors (all of them white males)
resort to the
poetic
diction I described above. 

<B></B>

 Here again
are Farrell (an extract from <I>Studs
Lonigan</I>) and Rolfe; "Poem for May First" is a clarion
call urging the
comrades to create a brave new world in the image of the new
Soviet Union.
Here
is an excerpt:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain will not deny
<BR>
the days that come with verdure nor the eye
<BR>
ignore the splendor of the changing year
<BR>
invested with surprise: bells clanging in the ear
<BR>
with sound that drowns the singing of the birds
<BR>
and voices rich with prophecy -- the words
<BR>
fraught with great deeds.
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The language of the people? Or an echo of Longfellow? If, as
Henri
Meschonnic and
Anthony Easthope (both, incidentally, marxist critics) have
argued, the
choice of
meter is itself an ideological choice,
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
then Rolfe's smooth
iambic-pentameter couplets have an interesting subtext.

<p>
And indeed by 1937 the <I>Partisan Review </I>had not only
dissociated
itself
from the John Reed Club, but was publishing mainstream
modernist and
neomodernist
works: the December 1937 issue featured Schwartz's "In
Dreams Begin
Responsibilities," Wallace Stevens's "The Dwarf," an essay
by William Troy
called
"The Symbolism of Zola," and reviews by Lionel Trilling,
Arthur Mizener,
Sidney
Hook, and Philip Rahv. Within a few years, <I>Partisan
Review </I>poetry,
fiction, and criticism were all but indistinguishable from
the poetry,
fiction,
and criticism of the "conservative" <I>Kenyon Review,
</I>founded in 1939.
The
first issue of the <I>Kenyon, </I>for that matter, included
Schwartz's
essay "The
Two Audens" and Rahv's "Franz Kafka: The Hero as Lonely
Man."

<p>
So began the rapprochement between the Left and its supposed
enemy, the New
Criticism. Meanwhile, the "other" or "aesthetic" radical
wing was less
fortunate.
"Poor ol White Mule," wrote Williams sadly to Richard Johns
in late 1933;
"I wish
I could go on with it. Not a word have I written on it since
Pagany busted"
(<I>ARP, </I>511). Not until 1937, when a young publisher
named James
Laughlin
came into the picture, did Williams have the heart to finish
his novel,
which
Laughlin offered to bring out.

<p>
The Objectivists and related <I>Pagany </I>poets had a
harder time of it.
Never
published in mainstream little magazines like <I>Partisan
Review, </I>they
more
or less went underground, not revived until the 1960s and
1970s, when
first the
Black Mountain/San Francisco poets and then the Language
group took them
up. At
the Poets of the Thirties Conference held at the University
of Maine in
June
1993, there were five sessions on Zukofsky alone and three
apiece on
Reznikoff,
Loy, and Lorine Niedecker, whose Objectivist poetry began to
appear
shortly after
the <I>Pagany </I>period. The keynote poetry reading,
moreover, was given,
before
a large and reverential audience, by the now ninety-year-old
Carl Rakosi.
The
poetic of the 1930s, distinct as that poetic is from the
modernism that
immediately preceded it, seems finally to be getting its
due. At the same
time--and perhaps this is why the early 1930s are so
fascinating for
us--the
split that haunts that American decade similarly haunts our

<B></B>

 own. The
argument for
"radical" subject matter (never mind its mode of production
or
materiality) is
once again being made, this time no longer for writers
identified with a
particular political party or movement, but for members of
"marginalized"
ethnic,
racial, and gender groups. Now as then, identity politics
often goes
hand-in-hand
with what turns out to be the most mainstream and
conventional of
aesthetics. A
real Revolution of the Word, we learn from such publications
as the
<I>"Objectivists" Anthology </I>or <I>Pagany, </I>cannot be
packaged; it
inevitably involves the "barbed-wire entanglements" that
made Harriet
Monroe
nervous, even as she had the courage to give them a hearing.

Richard Johns (born Richard Johnson in 1904) was the son of
a
well-known
Boston attorney named Benjamin N. Johnson, who had studied
with William
James at
Harvard. The young Johns attended Classical High School in
Lynn,
Massachusetts,
but dropped out before graduating and did not go on to
college; rather, he
travelled with his father to Greece, haunted the Boston
bookshops and read
voraciously, wrote poems and short stories, and between
1927-29 studied
comparative poetry and literary theory at Columbia. Having
no regular job,
Johns
decided in the late 1920s to start a literary magazine. For
this
background and
for an excellent scholarly study of the <I>Pagany
</I>archive, with
selections
from the magazine itself, see <I>A Return to Pagany: The
History,
Correspondence,
and Selections from a Little Magazine, 1929-1932, </I>ed.

Richard Johns (Boston: Beacon Press, 1969); hereafter

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT9" HREF="#REF9">9</a>.
This role is usually thought to have been played by
Williams: see
Stephen
Halpert in <I>ARP, </I>passim. But Peter Quartermain, who
has read the
unpublished (and currently inaccessible) correspondence
between Johns and
Zukofsky, has suggested to me in conversation that the
poetry selections
may well
reflect the choices of Zukofsky rather than Williams. This
would explain
why
Zukofsky is never listed under "Contributors' Notes" in
<I>Pagany </I>and
why
Johns published so many of the Objectivists, at a time when
they were
little
known.

Mary Butts's first husband was the English poet, critic,
printer, and
publisher John Rodker, who befriended Pound in Paris and
worked with him on
various projects; the surrealist poet Georges Hugnet, of
whose friendship
with
Stein more below, had written appreciative essays on Virgil
Thomson; Atget,
virtually unknown at the time of his death except by the
surrealist
cenacle and
other fellow artists, was rescued from oblivion by the
photographer
Berenice
Abbott, who saved his negatives, printed them, and brought
them to the U.
S. for
exhibition and sale when she returned to her native country
from Paris in
1929.

<p>
Johns's chief contact with Rodker, Thomson, Hugnet, et al.
was Sherry
Mangan,
Harvard graduate, classicist, and cosmopolitan
writer-critic, whom Johns
had
befriended in Boston; see <I>ARP, </I>17-20. On 28 August
1929, Mangan
wrote
Johns from Paris that he would round up some of the foreign
and expatriate
talent. "Djuna [Barnes]," he remarked, "is getting very
snooty, but may be
approachable" (<I>ARP,</I> 18). As it turned out, Barnes, in
contrast to
Stein,
never published in <I>Pagany. </I>

response to this issue, Stein wrote Johns, "I like you and

contemporaries appear, it will amuse you, and Virgil may

Stein met Hugnet, a young surrealist poet, through Virgil
Thomson in
1927. He
admired her work, translated some of her portraits and
selections from
<I>The
Making of Americans, </I>and together they translated
<I>Composition as
Explanation. </I>She then offered to reciprocate by
translating into
English his
suite of poems called <I>Enfances. </I>But translation was
not Stein's
game, and
as she proceeded, her version became increasingly "free,"
Hugnet's thirty
stanzas
being rendered by prose paragraphs as well as brief
sentences, and his
erotic
imagery almost entirely elided. Hugnet nevertheless planned
to publish the
two
versions in book form, again side-by-side, but Stein
objected to what she
saw as
her subsidiary position in the venture and broke off all
further contact
with
Hugnet, as her new title <I>Before the Flowers of Friendship
Faded
Friendship
Faded </I>suggests. See Richard Bridgman, <I>Gertrude Stein

<p>
In <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas </I>"Alice"
recalls, "In the
meantime,
Georges Hugnet wrote a poem called 'Enfance.' Gertrude Stein
offered to
translate
it for him, but instead wrote a poem about it. This at first
pleased
Georges
Hugnet too much and then did not please him at all. Gertrude
Stein then
called
the poem 'Before the Flowers of Friendship Faded Friendship
Faded.'"

<p>
No critical notion has proved more crucial to modern
investigations of
African
American expressive culture than the idea of double
consciousness. First
employed
to depict the consequences of the racial divide in W.E.B. Du
Bois's <I>The
Souls
of Black Folk </I>, double consciousness (together
with its variant
neologies, "twoness" and "doubleness") has exhibited a
profound degree of
interp.retive influence in scholarly studies throughout the
twentieth
century.
The idea of doubleness has remained effective because it
describes the
tenacity
of a racially determined "color line" that affects the
deepest layers of
American
life. At its worst it has sometimes become a kind of
theoretical readymade,
bestowing upon lesser works the appearance of profundity and
insight; but
in more
subtle reformulations, double consciousness has supplied
what is perhaps
the
fundamental interpretive tool of modern black criticism.
While the
compelling
insights of Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Henry Louis
Gates, Jr., and
Ishmael
Reed have suggested new critical maneuvers, they all seem,
as Arnold
Rampersad
observes, "[to] come out of . . . <I>The Souls of Black
Folk</I>--and most
precisely from Du Bois's image of the divided souls."
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
<I>The Souls </I>and its reflections on double consciousness
have remained
so
highly regarded by historians and critics of African
American culture
because
they vividly render the tragic effects of racialist
discourses, showing
how the
difference attributed to the hard-and-fast categories of
white and black is
imposed upon sentient selves. If African Americans accept
the 

<B></B>

 conditions
of the
racial divide, they must also deny the equality that their
experience
determines,
and even embrace the mystifications of blackness central to
the racial
imagination. In the paradox of the doubled soul--"gifted
with second-sight
[that]
. . . only lets him see himself through the revelation of
the other
world"--Du
Bois proposes an alternative to this view, one that also
upholds the
difference
of African American identity.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Rather than simply inverting
racial
logic (creating a positivity out of negativity, as negritude
and black-arts
writers would later attempt), Du Bois celebrates the
difference made real
in
black experience, while simultaneously exposing that
realness as a
discursive
fiction that can be transcended. This paradoxical
uncoupling, in turn, is
conveyed in the image of the slave spirituals that Du Bois
names the
"sorrow
songs," those soulful voicings that speak directly and with
historical
specificity of the slave tragedy even as they trace a
sublime ideal of
overcoming
social determinations and racial bounds. By preceding each
chapter with a
passage
from a sorrow song (together with verse by a white writer),
Du Bois
extends his
use of paradox, reconring doubleness as black sound,
whose transcendent
properties, in the romantic imagination, implicitly critique
the presumed
whiteness of the American character. If the sorrow songs, as
the "gift" of
second-sight, voice the passive sorrow of double
consciousness, they also
convey,
as an expression of coy, elusive resistance, a critical
poison <I>(das
Gift),
</I>with which the bilingual Du Bois, a lover of German and
German culture,
re-writes the meaning of American existence.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
The linking of doubleness with the critical power of black
music has long
been
crucial in assessing the place of <I>The Souls </I>in
twentieth-century
African
American criticism. The work is a "key text," one that
"underpins all that
follows it, and its importance is marked by the way Du Bois
places black
music as
the central sign of black cultural value, integrity, and
autonomy."
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Indeed, the musical mark of <I>The Souls
</I>stretches
across the history of modern African American writing,
informing the work
of
Hughes, Locke, Hurston, Brown, Baldwin, Ellison, and so many
others. In the
rhapsodic poetry of the black arts movement, moreover, black
music's
significance
was assigned especially high value, as writers and critics
sought to evoke
its
power in romantic gestures toward an ennobled jazz and blues
pantheon. For
Stephen Henderson, Jimmy Stewart, Don Lee, Imamu Amiri
Baraka and others,
African
American music signified the very essence of a primordial
African-based
culture,
and accordingly became a crucial element in their
definitions of the "black
aesthetic."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Yet what these critics ultimately seemed to be
reaffirming in their evocations was the privileged status of
African
American
poetry and literature. Despite an obvious respect for the
expressive power
of
black vernacular sound, they turned to music not to delve
analytically
into the
listening experience but in order to facilitate literary
understanding.
Music
functioned mainly as a supplement, an exoticized Other that
enhanced the
sense of
mystery and spirit informing the stable ground of text.

<p>
Since the 1980s, as critics of black culture have distanced
themselves
from the
reified categories of the black-arts movement, they have
increasingly
resituated
Du Boisian double consciousness in the unstable universe of
post-structuralism's
free play of signs. Significantly, the leading theorists of
black studies,
notably Houston A. 

<B></B>

 Baker, Jr. and Henry
Louis Gates, Jr., have avoided
simple
applications of deconstructionist practices that, in many of
their American
incarnations, obscure the politics of difference. Instead
they have
explored the
intercultural implications of doubleness, thus dismantling
essentialist
categories while excavating from the discursive terrain
impulses that
seemed to
well up from the ground of the historical vernacular. To
render the
formidable
power of these expressive impulses, Gates and particularly
Baker employ the
perception of black music and its affective immateriality to
convey the
elusive,
doubled "nature" of an orally-based African American
literature. In doing
so,
however, even these writers, despite their virtuoso critical
displays, have
sometimes rather incautiously embraced romantic myths of
music's
super-structural
capacities without acknowledging how these myths had
developed out of the
racialist language of folk authenticity. What Houston Baker
has called
"black
wholes," and Henry Louis Gates has referred to as the
musical basis of an
oral
"superconsciousness," is little more than an ahistorical
devotion to a
"vernacular" grounding that is reformulated in the
postmodern lexicon of
elusiveness: signifyin(g), the blues matrix, etc.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
The
problem here
lies not so much in their gestures toward the vernacular or
even in their
theories of an archeological strain of creative resistance,
but in their
perpetuation of an outmoded, nineteenth-century belief in
music's ability
to rise
above the circumstances of political, cultural, and social
change, to
overcome,
as an enduring continuity, the grand discursive web of
racialist
representations.
What we have once again--Baker's recent work
notwithstanding--is a return
to the
primordial wellspring of black origins, to a past that
transmits into the
present
the pure, untainted soundings of the soul of black folk.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
To be sure, some critics have argued that Du Bois,
reflecting the views of
his
time, seems to espouse equally essentialist notions.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
But Du
Bois
may also have critiqued them to an extent typically
unacknowledged in
secondary
literature. Given his notoriously ambivalent views of the
folk, it is
unlikely
that he would have sought to overcome double consciousness
by uncritically
embracing the commonplaces of vernacular authenticity.
Though his
portrayal of
the sorrow songs does embody motifs that his contemporaries
and
forerunners had
already articulated, he was also acutely aware of how they
had relegated
black
sacred music to pathetic minstrel stereotypes representing
the extremes of
human
emotion.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Moreover, nineteenth-century conrations of
folkness
and the vernacular were at odds with Du Bois's progressive
appeals to
culture and
civilization. For him, the folk realm, while signifying
transcendence,
immediacy,
purity, and completion, was always a pre-rational,
pre-discursive state
historically prior to a full-blown realization of
self-consciousness.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
According to the Hegelian master/slave
dialectic that Du Bois found so compelling, the natural
black self, having
endured the fate of bondage, had yet to attain true freedom
and awareness.
As a
subjectivity unresolved, it was forever "a consciousness
repressed within
itself," since, as Mark Taylor writes, "for Hegel, free
activity
presuppose[d]
complete self-consciousness."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
While the primordial realm of
folk
ironically identified the key to freedom, it remained
antithetical to the
reality
of that freedom. In the same way, the "sorrow songs," as a
primary emblem
of the
American folk 

<B></B>

 dimension, expressed
freedom while existing in a state prior
to
consciousness. Consistent with the romantic discourse of
antebellum music
criticism, black folk music as "spiritual" evoked the
"second-sight" of
liberation even as its makers, possessing "no true
self-consciousness"
(<I>SBF,</I>16), remained enslaved.

<p>
Recognizing the logical tension between folkness and a
rational or
self-conscious
freedom, Du Bois, I believe, intended a more subtle reading
of the sorrow
songs,
one that acknowledged the paradoxes and complexities of
African American
twoness
at a particularly unstable historical moment. Though making
direct
overtures to
racialist notions of cultural continuity, Du Bois also
recognized how
music's
material ties to the social made meaning contingent on the
circumstances
of time
and place. "Art expression in the day of slavery had to be
very limited,"
he
observed, "a matter of wild strains of music and still
wilder laughter and
dancing."
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The sorrow songs might well reveal a natural
essence--"diamonds in the rough," as Bernard Bell has called
them--but they
offered little in the way of insight or powers of critique.
As Du Bois
seemed to
realize, they had long since ceased to be "pure" or
"authentic," having
been
rewritten, mediated, and ultimately "transformed" (<I>SBF,
</I>68) through
romantic imaginings of folk difference.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
By this time,
moreover, Du
Bois was already committed to the progressive sensibilities
of a "talented
tenth"
as the key to black self-consciousness, making it unlikely
that he would
view the
"pythian madness" and "demoniac possession" of folkness as a
purely
emancipatory
force in the age of Jim Crow. Self-consciousness, instead,
would be
<I>created
</I>in the new hybridities of African American authenticity
that were
emerging in
the late nineteenth century in response to the denials of
black creative
ability.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
Significantly, Du Bois appears to have discerned a nascent
expression of
this
process in the black concert-choir movement epitomized by
Fisk University's
Jubilee Singers.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Founded in the late 1860s by a white
professor to
feature the singing abilities of the school's most talented
students--the
majority of whom were former slaves--the Jubilee Singers won
world-wide
acclaim
for "classicized" performances of slave songs that had been
transcribed and
arranged for the concert stage. That the Fisk repertory,
marking the
height of
vernacular authenticity in the white imagination, developed
as part of the
institutional apparatus of modernization seems only to have
dramatized the
significance of the transformation African American culture
was
undergoing. For
Du Bois, the Fisk song-texts were both a marker of a
profound moment of
change
and a harbinger of the new black civilization, of a fully
realized
consciousness
of vast critical potential, clearly distinguished from, and
more powerful
than,
the separate and pure semi-consciousness of an uncompleted
black folk.

<p>
The distinction between a sonic soulfulness based in the
vernacular and
"soul
texts" that encourage consciousness in the making is
crucial: it not only
identifies the emergence of a critical blackness that both
reflects and
rejects
modernism's progressive image, but complicates the easy
opposition of the
authentic and the counterfeit (and related dichotomies of
oral/written,
folk/urban, low/high culture, and even black/white) that has
grounded so
many
modern determinations of difference. In the double logic of
the texted
African
American spiritual, Du Bois recognizes the 

<B></B>

 secret of overcoming the
socially
constituted boundaries of "race." He argues for the
exclusivity and
specialness
of black <I>difference, </I>drawing upon the romantic notion
of black
music as an
authentic Other unobtainable by whites, yet also insists
that such
mystifications
deny blacks a rightful <I>sameness </I>in American society
when applied to
other
aspects of African American culture. His critical polemic,
in turn, is
buttressed
by his revisionary account of black music. What was once
scripted as a
pure, oral
form can now be rewritten into concert songs in order to
articulate the
modern
ideal of an authentic black vernacular: "the most beautiful
expression . .
. born
this side the seas" (<I>SBF, </I>182). This <I>second
texting </I>is a
negation
of a negation, a critical<I> re</I>-presentation of an
earlier "spiritual"
discourse initially fashioned by folklorists and
transcendentalists. The
soul
texts, as the principal repertory of the Fisk Jubilees, put
into action a
black
vocalized force that was profoundly new and announced the
emergence of an
expressive African American self-consciousness.

<p>
In the texted universe of the Fisk Jubilees, then, the power
of musical
transcendence is affirmed through the <I>amplification
</I>of a romantic
discourse celebrating black difference. According to Du
Bois, these
vocalizations
of written text, of a difference that has been recognized,
named, and
partly
<I>realized </I>by white Others, offers African Americans a
means of
attaining a
higher, civilized level that depends on the very difference
of
race.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Appearing as the temporal antithesis of the primordial
folk,
moreover, this new and conscious black wholeness is at once
of the moment
and
part of the ancient. By rering folk's transcendental
discourse,
textuality
recovers for black culture the means of realizing a new
completion after
over two
hundred years of slavery. African-American song now becomes
the source of a
self-reflexive, modern consciousness that draws likenesses
to white
America even
as it simultaneously looks back toward the primordial
wholeness and
homeness of
an imagined African past.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
As such, modern African American
music
paradoxically locates completion in texted assimilation and
difference, in
an
inscribed twoness whose potential for real, conscious
presence supplies the
supplemental <I>Gift </I>to an unblemished white America. It
is this
<I>Gift
</I>of black sound-out-of-text that provides Du Bois with
his activist
voice. Far
from a mere book of prosody and song, <I>The Souls
</I>represents Du
Bois's means
of self-becoming, through which he issued a difference in
scripted tone
that
would resonate across the colorless imaginations of
twentieth-century white
America.

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_a-head-->

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
It has been frequently noted that Du Bois seeks to convey in
<I>The Souls
</I>a
new means of writing about race. By casting the text as a
"singing book,"
Houston
Baker observes, he presages modern techniques in black
writing,
transforming the
"objective" discourse of the academy into a prophetic
critical prosody
(<I>MHR,</I> 68). Moreover, allusions to the rhetorical
powers of the black
preacher alternate with visionary passages of Wordsworthian
grandeur to
create
the impression that space is being transformed into sound
and time; the
book
exceeds the limits of site/sight, and conjures up images of
a discernible
musical
presence. Traces of sound reverberate 

<B></B>

across the text, animating and
enlivening
social commentary with "cadences of Negro song" (<I>SBF,</I>
60). The
chapter "Of
the Meaning of Progress," for example, traces harsh
realities "softened by
laughter and song" (<I>SBF,</I> 55), and offers fanciful
images of a
laughing
sun, "jingl[ing] water," and the "patter of little feet"
eagerly advancing
toward
learning (<I>SBF,</I> 57). In "Of the Golden Fleece," the
reader hears
"the hum
of the cotton-mills" (<I>SBF,</I> 104), which gives way to
songs of love
and
laughter and echoes "the clang [of] the day-bell" in "Of the
Wings of
Atalanta"
(<I>SBF, </I>69). "Of the Black Belt" is saturated with
vivid, tuneful
activity:
field hands calling, cotton gins groaning, brooks singing,
and "five
hundred
persons" gathering on consecrated space to make spiritual
sound (<I>SBF,
</I>93,
95, 102). As the text proceeds these sounds swell and reach
a feverish
pitch when
Du Bois imagines, in the language of a nineteenth-century
travelogue, a
noise-filled <I>Land of Fetish, </I>populated by dark,
pagan, "barbaric"
folk.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Here, linkages of "the Preacher, the Music, and the
Frenzy"
(<I>SBF,</I> 141) draw the listening reader into a southern
revival that
anticipates, as a pre-civilized folk encounter, the
remarkable concluding
chapter, "Of the Sorrow Songs." Brimming with evocative
passages,
voicings, and
quotations from well-known spiritual texts, <I>The Souls
</I>becomes a
texted
record that conveys the experience of hearing and is much
more than just a
"song
book." Adopting once again the oratorical rhythms of the
preacher--"the
most
unique personality developed by the Negro on American soil"
(<I>SBF,</I>
141)--<I>The Souls </I>actualizes the voice of blackness:
assertive,
"haunting,"
and palpably<I> heard.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
Du Bois implies that his book captures the very soul of
black folk, "some
echo of
haunting melody from the only American music which welled up
from . . .
the dark
[African] past,"
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
a phrase suggesting the wholeness of a
primordial
folk that is transparent, true, even tactile. Though
darkened by savagery
and
slavery, its resonance has been sustained by a "tropical
imagination" that
brings
into the present "bursts of melody, full of the voices of my
brothers and
sisters, full of the voices of the past" (<I>SBF,</I> 146,
181). Yet Du
Bois is
also aware that the immediate perception of folk and folk
sound has been
closed
off to him. Though he repeatedly proclaims the glory and
effect of the
sorrow
song, he laments its remove from his own immediate
experience. Many of his
passing references to song are cast in a nostalgic haze that
recalls a
similar
"passing-away [of] a certain type of Negro" and his
"southern
gentleman[ly]"
brethren (<I>SBF, </I>68). "Voices of the past" might
signify a homeland,
but
that homeland remains elsewhere, in "darkness." The folk
"voices" that Du
Bois
heard at Fisk emerged from a realm still commensurate with
his own
experience; a
decade or more later, however, they seem doubly removed from
his present
life.
Similarly, the songs themselves now exist at one remove from
the imagined
fixities of the vernacular, displaced into the apparatus of
public
culture. They
are already an "echo," a sound that has been transformed by
contact with
the
bodies and discourses of Others, only to materialize,
re-presented, upon
the
unmusical surfaces of silent text. As a sociologist,
moreover, Du Bois
recognizes
the profound regional diversity of African American life, a
complex
society and
culture whose disunity can only have heightened his sense of
alienation
and loss.
Discussing the rapidly developing 

<B></B>

cityscape, for example, he observes an
emerging
urban-centrism that has replaced an earlier black
vernacular. "Once upon a
time
we knew country life so well and city life so little," but
"now the world
ha[s]
well-nigh forgotten what the country is" (<I>SBF, </I>91).
The loss of
cultural
memory has been accompanied by oversimplifications and false
totalities,
"wholesale arguments covering millions separate in time and
space, and
differing
widely in training and culture" (<I>SBF,</I> 105). If Du
Bois seems to be
describing his own mystifications of a lost folk innocence
and a dark,
primal
Africa,
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
he is also remarkably sensitive to how the
peculiarities of
social circumstance complicate the romantic ideal of an
ever-lasting,
racially
determined essence. As Arnold Rampersad notes, Du Bois
affirms
Luk&aacute;cs's
historicist vision of the art work as something "socially
and historically
determined and . . . the product of a social
development."
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

src=thumb/2.1radano_1t.gif
alt=IMAGE LINK></a>
Nowhere
is this "passing-away" more poignantly expressed than in "Of
the Meaning of
Progress," where Du Bois remarks how vast the differences in
African
American
culture were becoming. Returning to Fisk to visit former
colleagues in
"the halls
of the chapel of melody" (<I>SBF, </I>60), he finds that
things no longer
seem or
sound the same. In a moment of "sudden longing," he yearns
"to pass again"
beyond
the Chapel and behind the veil, into the outlying community
where he
taught black
folk during the summers of his college years (<I>SBF,</I>
60). There he
first
witnessed "other worlds" peopled by "magnificent barbarism,"
whose
"half-awakened
common consciousness" sounded as "soft melody and mighty
cadences"
(<I>SBF,</I>
60). Yet just as the blessings of folk glory have forsaken
this community,
which
has been overcome with "a heap of trouble" (<I>SBF,</I> 61)
since his
passing, so
has its former resonance fallen into silence. At the moment
when he
"pass[es]
again" (<I>SBF,</I> 60) the tale sinks into a deep pathos
devoid of sound.
The
most telling signs of life no longer appear in song, but in
the material
embodiments of a dubious progress, such as the replacement
of his log-built
school house with a new "jaunty board house" on a stone
foundation that is
already "weary" (<I>SBF,</I> 62). The board house (made by
refining and
"civilizing" rough-cut logs) is described with similarly
ambivalent signs:
window-glass, a lens into reason and learning, that is half
broken; a
blackboard,
the tablet of reasonable script, enlarged. The new school
stands "not far
away
[from] . . . the former site of my poor little cabin"
(<I>SBF,</I> 62), a
past
site/sight still marked by foundation stones now supporting
an absence.
"As [he
sits] by the spring . . . and look[s] on the Old and the
New" (<I>SBF,
</I>62),
Du Bois recognizes the relic of a former sight that has
passed on,
displaced like
the freed slaves themselves, to give way to a "second-sight"
of
"Progress."
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
The prefatory citation of a poem by Schiller in
the
original German epitomizes European knowledge, and seems to
signify the
potential
"of some faint-dawning day" (<I>SBF,</I> 64). What that
progress can bring,
however, is offset by the incipit of the song "My Way's
Cloudy," whose
rhythmic
identity has been disred in an improperly transcribed
excerpt of
sorrow song
(. <a href=2.1radano_1.html>1</a> and <a
href=2.1radano_2.html>2</a>).

<p>
For Du Bois knowledge, reason, and the generative power of
writing turn on
a
"savage irony;" as Rampersad observes in his discussion of
"Of the Coming
of
John," "for the black man in a racist world, the acquisition
of culture is
a
dangerous and 

<B></B>

 often destructive
process" (<I>AI, </I>75-76). While holding
the
secrets to power and knowledge, culture can also--as the
<I>reason
</I>behind a
history of enslavement--turn against its possessor.
Similarly, Western
reason, it
seems, is neither stable nor certain, but volatile,
mysterious, hot--not
unlike
the powers of conjure in the "tropical imagination"
(<I>SBF,</I> 186).
Through
the gift of the "second-sight," Du Bois hopes that African
Americans can
harness
the power of America's late-century cultural transformation
to fashion a
different reason, a reason in difference, one that will give
voice to the
modern
and yet recover a former, "ancient" self. Doubleness will be
maintained as
a
series of unresolved binaries of rationality/irrationality,
science/magic,
black/white, for if these were ever stabilized, they would
lead to the
<I>instability </I>of black experience. Du Bois, it seems,
recognizes the
virtues
of stability in instability. "The genius of <I>The Souls of
Black Folk,"
</I>David Levering Lewis writes, "was that it transcended
this dialectic
in the
most obvious way--by affirming it in a permanent tension"
(<I>DBBR,
</I>281).
Difference creates a foundationless foundation vividly
red in the
doubling of
pure African sound. African American consciousness, like the
primordially
decentered "rhythms of Africa," would be "one music as
before, But vaster"
(<I>SBF, </I>139).

<p>
If Du Bois hears the primordial wholeness of Africa in a
"vastness"
pointing
toward the modern, he also encounters a reflection of his
doubled "black"
self in
the "chapel of melody" (<I>SBF, </I>60) that issues hybrid
variations of
"real
music" from Europe, Africa, and America. Fisk engaged "a new
loyalty and
allegiance," he writes in <I>The Autobiography, </I>"[that]
replaced my
Americanism: henceforward I was a Negro" (<I>AI, </I>12). In
a provocative
analysis, Houston Baker suggests how the image of the chapel
projects Du
Bois's
concept of blackness by translating materiality and hardship
into song.
According
to Baker, the description of Fisk's Jubilee Hall--"'its

<B></B>

[<a href="2.1radano_2.html">re 2</a>] <b>[Begin Page 80]</B>

 bricks were red
with
blood and dust of toil'--signals the real topography of Du
Bois's
landscape . . .
a longing to build edifices of culture out of melodies of
ancient
spiritual song"
(<I>MHR,</I> 65-66). Perhaps Du Bois hears such a song
unifying black
consciousness. Steeped in the rhetoric of romantic
racialism, he
increasingly
draws linkages that contradict his awareness of the
contingencies of
historical
circumstances and the weaknesses of cultural memory. Yet if
the sorrow
songs are
"ancient"--as he claims in a later passage (<I>SBF,
</I>183)--so are they
also "a
haunting echo," a sonorous apparition "full of the voices of
the past"
(<I>SBF,</I> 181). "The rhythmic cry of the slave," while
represented in
the new
Africanist discourse of Henry M. Stanley, was also "born
this side the
seas"
(<I>SBF,</I> 181-82). Despite his racialist proclivities, Du
Bois appears
to
recognize that African Americans cannot unify the historical
complexities
of
blackness merely by gesturing to an undisrupted constant of
racial sound,
one
that, indeed, was previously constructed by whites who
yearned for its
fetishized
form. The song that represents his sole "direct connection .
. . with
Africa"
(<I>DD,</I> 114-15) has been passed on from generation to
generation. And
while
he "know[s] well the meaning of its music" (<I>SBF,
</I>184), he also
recognizes
that meaning as something imagined, originating in "voices
of the past"
and sung
by a people of a different time and place who "walked in
darkness" (<I>SBF,
</I>181). If "the true Negro folksong[s]," those "siftings
of centuries,"
live on
"in the hearts of the Negro people" (<I>SBF, </I>183), they
have undergone
an
enormous "transformation," following a four-stage
evolutionary pattern from
"African music," to "Afro-American" song, to a racial blend
that finally
gives
way to the syntheses of Stephen Foster (<I>SBF, </I>185).
The process of
<I>"re-membering" </I>by which, Baker argues, black folkness
has
"rer[ed] the
very notion of 'culture' for the modern world" first
required the
rering of
an originary, romantic discourse that imagined blackness at
the extremes
of white
racialist fantasy (<I>MHR,</I> 65-66). Through this second
texting, the
slave
songs, like the freed slaves themselves, musically affirm
"the secret of
civilization" (<I>SBF,</I> 71, 87). An appropriated European
musical
writing has
supplied the means of enacting a modern form of black
conjure: "civilized"
African American musical art initiates a shift from
selflessness to
self-consciousness, alchemically producing a Second
Awakening toward the
"regeneration of the Negro" (<I>SBF,</I> 87).

<p>
Only once does Du Bois recall hearing the songs of black
folk prior to his
studies at Fisk. In a powerful passage from <I>Dusk of Dawn
</I>, he
remembers a performance by a Hampton Quartet that stirred in
him deep
emotion. In
this sound, so different from the German hymns and band
music common to
his rural
New England environment, he "seemed to recognize something
inherently and
deeply
my own," so powerful, he confides, that "I was thrilled and
moved to
tears."
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Recollecting this moment sixty years later, Du Bois is
remembering not so much the past itself, but the past as he
experienced it
in
what was then the present. Even so, Du Bois remains faithful
to his belief
in the
power of song to express the character of a racial group.

<B></B>

 Significantly,
the
passage as a whole juxtaposes the musical experience with
another first
encounter, his entrance into the community of black culture.
During a
picnic on
Narragansett Bay, "[I] had seen in open-mouthed astonishment
the whole
gorgeous
color gamut of the Negro world." From that moment on, he
explains, "I
became
aware, once a chance . . . was opened for me, of the
spiritual isolation
in which
I was living . . . . I was glad to go to Fisk" (<I>DD,</I>
23).

<p>
Racial solidarity, Europeanized sacred music, and the
progress of learning
fuse
as a model of black realness and authenticity; they
represent the Du
Boisian
composite of "[becoming] a Negro" (<I>AI,</I> 12). This
realness, of
course, was
hardly culturally "pure." Education at Fisk combined the
classical study of
Western culture with the evangelical prophecies of the
American Ministry
Association, whose resources had helped to establish the
university.
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Both were juxtaposed with the new critical
thought of
engaged students who represented a spectrum of post-war,
rural, black
culture. In
<I>The Autobiography, </I>Du Bois admiringly recalls how he
and others
discovered
the languages and history of European traditions, taught by
a mostly
white, New
England and midwestern faculty who challenged the
evolutionary racism that
had
become increasingly common in the American academy. If the
faculty failed
to
address the fallacies of social Darwinism, he notes, "in
most cases the
student
opinion naturally forced [them to do so]."
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
"Civilization"
involved
but never overwhelmed an awareness of being black. Nor did
the impurity of
modern
black music deny its significance for Du Bois: "I heard the
Negro folksong
first
in Great Barrington, sung by the Hampton Singers. But that
was second
hand, sung
by youth who never knew slavery" (<I>A,</I> 120). Still, in
that hybridity
he
recognized something so profound it could move him to tears.
To be sure,
Du Bois
is not abiding by our current conventions of authenticity
when he
distinguishes
Jubilee forms from the more firmly planted vernacular
expressions of
Tennessee,
nor when he fails to distinguish the privately-run Fisk
chorus of the
1880s from
the original touring ensemble that had been dissolved by the
University in
1878
in response to the rash of performances by counterfeit
Jubilee
troupes.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Likewise, he scarcely troubles to justify his
membership
in Fisk's Mozart Society, his nostalgic recollections of
performing the
<I>Hallelujah Chorus, </I>or his abiding love of Beethoven,
Wagner, and
the other
composers of "real [German] music" that he discovered at
Harvard and
Berlin.
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
For Du Bois, racial and cultural purity matter less
than the
capability of a musical work to articulate real, civilized
presence. In
the newly
cultivated expressions of the Jubilee Singers he recognizes
a fundamental
message
relating to Negro progress. The spiritual songs embody a
significant
hybridity of
race, culture, and learning which expresses what we might
call the twoness
of
oneness--the emancipation of blackness in the reality of
doubled
difference.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
The twoness of black musical authenticity is more than a
private vision of
the Du
Boisian imagination; it describes the real-life
circumstances under which
the
Fisk songs emerged as an international musical phenomenon.
What is commonly
assumed to have been a repetition of original slave
music--"the actual
sound of
Afro-American strivings" (<I>MHR, </I>66)--grew out of a
series of
textings and
re-textings 

<B></B>

 in which an earlier
romantic discourse gradually gave way to a
radically novel, objectified form. Far from an authentic
recollection of
slave
singing practices, the jubilees were more like a scripted
forgetting, in
which
recent methods and musical conceptions gave birth to a new
repertory that
paid
tribute to a passing vernacular culture. Having witnessed
these songs'
entrance
into public circulation, Du Bois ultimately honors their
retextualization
in the
song portraits that animate <I>The Souls. </I>

In their earliest incarnation, the Fisk songs emerged as a
summation of
vernacular expression, one that reflected the diverse
classes and cultural
backgrounds of Fisk students in the late 1860s.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<I> </I>The
body of
songs that had originally developed from casual music-making
was
subsequently
revised and reworked over a two-year period, during which a
select group of
students perfected a concertized impression of slave singing
under the
direction
of a white faculty member and former Union army officer,
George L. White
(. <a href=2.1radano_3.html>3</a>
and <a href=2.1radano_4.html>4</a>). At first the Fisk
singers had no intention of
performing these
refashioned sorrow songs in public. Adhering to Fisk's
progressive
policies, they
preferred a European choral repertory with which to "prove
they could do
as well
as whites." But as minstrel-minded audiences demanded
performances of
spirituals,
the Fisk singers first presented them as encores, then
prepared a
repertory of
sacred works under the guidance of 

<B></B>

Professor White.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
White's
pedagogy was based on European tradition, and though in at
least one
instance
this merely reinforced prior training, it nevertheless
affected not only
musical
style, but the very means of performative expression.
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
Seeking to
replicate the style of European choral art, the Fisk singers
adopted the
posture,
behavior, enunciation, methods of breathing, and other
bodily disciplines
of the
concert stage. Still, vernacular practices persisted enough
to present an
unprecedented expressive form in the circumstances of
performance.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
For many white Americans, this hybrid of choral singing
appeared to
reinforce
romantic stereotypes of African American docility and
inferiority, insofar
as the
performers seemed well-mannered and willing to comply with
white norms.
But for
many members of Fisk and their African American admirers,
the "Fisk sound"
more
likely embodied the new authenticity of a black performative
culture built
upon
white assumptions of blacks' natural musical gifts. In this
latter
discursive
space, African American culture founded a powerful and
remunerative
expressive
force widely recognized (yet rarely understood) by a
world-wide spectrum of
paying audiences.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
Folkloric ideals of authenticity had accompanied the
appearance of the
slave
songs in public discourse since the mid-1840s, just as they
informed
conceptions
of the "spiritual" a decade or so later.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Ironically, the
institutional and discursive processes that would
subsequently bring
"vernacular"
forms into modern society and culture obscured the very
factors that
distinguished the folk past from the modernized present.

<B></B>

 As if
contradicting
Walter Benjamin's position on the demystifying effects of
mechanical
reproduction, each new interpretation of sorrow song
appeared to intensify
the
spiritual's aura of realness and primordial power. And
because the idea of
an
authentic African American music performed by blacks
themselves arose
during a
historical period still dominated by minstrel parody, that
"realness"
could be
little more than a fiction once the spirituals emerged as a
national
concept.
From its inception, then, authentic "black music" as a
modern phenomenon
existed
in an uneasy symbiosis of real and unreal, a kind of
produced authenticity
that
was intimately connected to the institutional matrices of
modernization.
That
black music, and the spirituals in particular, have so
frequently
epitomized the
difference of the "black experience" in twentieth-century
culture raises
serious
questions about the rhetoric of vernacular purity that still
informs
depictions
of modern genres, from jazz to blues, from soul to rap.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
While
the
discourses of authenticity have obviously provided an
important defense
against a
racist and oppressive culture and served in shaping African
American
collective
memory, they have also continued to validate notions of
difference that
limit the
extent of black self-definition. What Du Bois finds so
appealing about the
modernizing process that generated images of the jubilee
songs is how it,
at
least at that time, contradicted easy assumptions about the
character of
African
American culture, even as it publicly certified the
constructs of
authenticity
attributed to black music. As a power that emerged as a
stability in
instability,
black music seemed appropriately to reveal such ambivalences
of meaning and
effect.

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_a-head-->

</H3>

<p>
A notable step in the spirituals' acquisition of authentic
signification
was the
appearance of the Fisk Jubilees at Patrick Gilmore's World
Peace Jubilee in
Boston in 1872. When the orchestra began "John Brown" in a
key well beyond
the
range of typical chorus singers, the Jubilees saved the
performance by
adapting
their voices to the new demands. The tale, which is perhaps
apocryphal,
firmly
secured the group's racially-bound authentic image.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
When the
Jubilees sang overseas, moreover, they were received as the
true
representatives
of black vernacular culture, a recognition not accorded to
other more
"authentic"
groups that had truly emerged from American rural
territories. For the
Jubilees
were more than just rural; within a vast network of
vernacular signs, they
furnished a commodified folkness ready for public
consumption. As official
servants of black education, <I>de facto </I>representatives
of the
missionary
movement, and symbols of American democracy, they offered
European
listeners a
discursive matrix saturated with competing values, mixing
images of
evangelical
Christianity, slave emancipation, and the raw, uncivilized,
seemingly-unbounded
"freedom" of an emerging imperial power. Enthusiastic
receptions before
appreciative crowds and private audiences with Kings and
Queens further
magnified
the power of this "authentic" illusion. Visiting Great
Britain and
Germany, the
lands of <I>Border Minstrelsy </I>and the Brothers Grimm,
the Jubilees
almost
seemed to have come home, bringing "the field" of African
and American
barbarism
to the 

<B></B>

 motherlands of folk discourse
and ethnographic
representation.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
For the Fisk musicians and the African
Americans who
followed their critical and financial success, however, this
return to the
roots
of European folk fantasy signified a home-coming of a
different kind.
Having won
unprecedented approval and earnings through extreme cultural
displacement,
they
could now comprehend new forms of "place" unimaginable even
a few years
before.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
The transformation of slave singing was achieved by the
reconstitution of
the
Fisk performances as a form of European written music.
Unlike earlier
efforts to
preserve rural music, such as those of Thomas Wentworth
Higginson, William
Francis Allen, Lucy McKim Garrison, and others a decade
before, the
notation of
Fisk melodies not only documented oral musical practices,
but supplied the
written basis for new "authentic" performances that
"spr[a]ng into life,
ready-made, from the white heat of religious fervor."
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Yet
while
Theodore Seward, the white church musician from New York who
transcribed
the Fisk
performances, claimed that the scores provided an exact
replica of the Fisk
sound, he also conceded that its "peculiarit[ies]" resisted
the dictates of
European notational practice.
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Even so, for the general public
Seward's transcriptions had accurately captured the music of
the Fisk
Jubilees,
and remained the standard source until the 1910s (when a
later generation
of Fisk
choirs made phonograph recordings). Listeners who had heard
performances
based on
them were free to imagine that they were being performed by
the Jubilees
themselves, a true voice of authenticity, while others were
equally free to
imagine their own versions, since the song texts had been
appearing in
ever-increasing numbers after the initial publication of
<I>The Jubilee
Songs
</I>in 1872.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
As interest in the songs grew, variety
proliferated,
from the versions of "real folk music" championed by the
likes of Mark
Twain, who
entertained friends with occasional bursts of sacred black
song, to the
many
groups of spurious "Jubilee Singers" who had never visited
the South and
its
originary chapel of melody.

Steeped in the newly-constructed terrain of vernacular
authenticity at a
moment
of rapid cultural change called "progress," Du Bois was both
a product of
these
discourses and one of their severest critics. Just as he
observed the broad
distances that separated the folk past from an emerging
urban-modern
present, so
he discerned in these romantic fictions an emancipatory
potential that
could
sustain his critical voice. In the final chapter of <I>The
Souls, </I>Du
Bois
acknowledges his debt to the fields we now call
ethnomusicology and
folklore. He
singles out for praise the "first-text" transcribers of
vernacular singing
practices, notably Higginson and Garrison (forgetting his
debt to Frederick
Douglass, the originator of the epithet, "sorrow song"),
those who had
personally
witnessed the sounds of slave culture and "urged upon the
world their rare
beauty" (<I>SBF,</I> 182-88).
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
By classifying the songs
according to
an evolutionary scale, he also pays silent tribute to
William Francis
Allen, who,
in the Introduction to <I>Slave Songs of the United
States,</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
had
charted the origins and development 

<B></B>

 of
black vernacular song as a series
of grand
historical epochs. Moving on, moreover, Du Bois honors the
second layer of
textings performed by George White, whose "life-work was to
let those
Negroes
sing to the world as they had sung to them" (<I>SBF,
</I>182-83). He
describes
this process as a cross cultural give-and-take, during which
White "sang
with
[his students] and taught them to sing," while they, at the
same time,
"taught
him to sing, and . . . the glory of the Jubilee songs passed
into [his]
soul"
(<I>SBF,</I> 182). Du Bois's sources here are clearly the
authorized
histories of
Pike and Marsh, whose narratives he briefly summarizes
through the chorus's
appearances in Europe. And it is in both of these texts that
one finds
many of
the transcriptions from which Du Bois drew in writing <I>The
Souls.
</I>Occasionally he quotes literally from Seward's
notations; other times
he
extracts only portions or varies the particulars of the
original; and
still other
times he turns to two alternative sources, Allen's <I>Slave
Songs of the
United
States </I>and Dett's <I>Religious Folk-Songs of the Negro,
</I>the latter
documenting the songs of the Hampton singers.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Together these
quotations celebrate the emergence of a new musical form,
even as, in their
inaccuracy and uniqueness, they pay homage to a rapidly
fading past. The
incipits
are like an epitaph inscribed on a gravestone, marking the
vanished body
of a
prior resonance (<a href=2.1radano_5.html> 5</a>).

<p>
Du Bois, I think, was acutely aware of the complex play of
interracial
signification from which the new black musical culture had
emerged; and in
order
to underscore its significance, he inscribed its material
testimonies
directly
onto the pages of his book. Far from upholding fixed notions
of folkness,
Du Bois
celebrated hybridity--and did so most deliberately, placing
quotations of
Euro-Western verse by Lowell, Byron, Schiller, and others
directly after
each
incipit of sorrow song. As Shelley Fisher Fishkin and others
have observed,
"these paired 'quotations,' . . . by their very
juxtaposition, reveal the
notion
of a 'color line' to be a fiction--when it comes to the
strivings of the
human
spirit or the aspirations of the human soul."
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
For Du Bois,
such
hybridities were not a denial of blackness; they were the
secret of its
true
creative potential. Within the romance that colored white
yearnings for the
spirituals, yearnings that inspired not only unbridled
praise but efforts
of
appropriation by Higginson, Allen, Twain, and the like, Du
Bois had
recognized
the political significance of high culture's increasing
responsiveness to
the
domain of folk.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Into the 1880s and 1890s, distinguished
European
and Euro-American artists and critics such as
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Louis
Ritter
and Henry Edward Krehbiel extended that praise in published
forums,
suggesting in
some cases that African Americans possessed qualities of
expression
unobtainable
by whites.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
Especially noteworthy was the commentary of Antonin
Dvor&aacute;k, the celebrated Czech composer, who had moved
to New York in
1892
in order to direct the National Conservatory of Music.
Writing in <I>The
New York
Herald </I>in 1893 and then in <I>Harper's </I>in 1895,
Dvor&aacute;k
argued the
now-common claim that black spirituals were the true folk
songs of the
United
States, and he urged American composers to employ them as
the basis of
their
national art. Given the powerful influence of Dvor&aacute;k
on the American
concert world, it is likely that he also inspired Du Bois,
who would make a
similar argument in <I>The Souls: </I>the songs were 

<B></B>

[<a href="2.1radano_5.html">re 5</a>] <b>[Begin Page 88]</B>

 "the most beautiful
expression of human experience born this side the seas"
(<I>SBF, </I>182).
Dvor&aacute;k's implication that black music was the key to
interracial,
national
unity could only have reinforced such an attraction.

In the
image of
a hybrid song's transcendence, then--more so than in an
exclusive and
separate
"black vernacular"--Du Bois had found the secret of the
Second Awakening:
it
would put into motion a "transformation" (<I>SBF,</I> 68)
destabilizing the
whiteness and oneness of American life. As such, the
conspicuous inclusion
of
texted sorrow songs across the pages of <I>The Souls
</I>conveys yet
another
significance: they refer not only to racial transcendence,
but also to the
destabilization of racial categories of black and white. As
Houston Baker
observes, the pairing of white text and black song carries a
critical
force,
effecting "a displacement or a deconstruction of Western
expressive
culture by
the spirituals."
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
This, moreover, explains why the final
chapter
contains an ancestral African song in the context of praise
for the German
lyric
and white "creators." In a rectified double consciousness,
blackness
thrives; and
just as oral music developing from the slave experience has
been completed
by
virtue of its engagements with Euro-American music and its
notation, so
the black
modern presence gives form to its double in the prior
completion of the
African
background. It is in this <I>gift </I>of song, anticipated
by the Fisk
Jubilees
and later expressed in the concert spirituals of Harry T.
Burleigh--whose
artistry both Du Bois and Dvor&aacute;k would
celebrate--that one
recognizes the
"message . . . that Negro blood has . . . for the world"
(<I>SBF,</I>
17).
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
In these hybrid soul texts (as opposed to the "debased"
forms
of blues and jazz, which were associated with a
"semi-conscious"
vernacular), Du
Bois heard the "combinational" or "difference tones" of the
American
experience,
those seemingly sourceless yet eerily audible truths
emanating from the
collision
of two bodies of sound (<a href=2.1radano_6.html>
6</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
As Jubilees, they carry
profound
powers of invasion and seduction, penetrating deep into the
psyche and
spirit. As
Du Bois observed, the musical teachings of the Fisk singers
did not merely
resonate; they "pass[ed] into the soul of George L. White"
(<I>SBF,</I>
182).
Thus realized, the critical force of musical doubleness
would never take
stable
form. Across the twentieth century, it would, as a
<I>dis-closure </I>of
black
consciousness, register a critique of the unities and
dominance of an
exclusive,
Euro-concert domain. The permanence of that critical
instability
reverberates
loudly from the final pages of <I>The Souls </I>as Du Bois
issues this
defiant
message:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Your Country? How came it yours? Before the Pilgrims landed
we were here.
Here we
have brought our three gifts and mingled them with yours: a
gift of story
and
song--soft, stirring melody in an ill-harmonized and
unmelodious land; the
gift
of sweat and brawn to beat back the wilderness, conquer the
soil, and lay
the
foundations of this vast economic empire two hundred years
earlier than
your weak
hands could have done it; the third a gift of the Spirit.
Around us the
history
of the land has centered for thrice a hundred years.

Du Bois asks: "Would America have been America without her
Negro people?"
(<I>SBF, </I>190). In reply, he imagines a "second-sighting"
that
identifies the <I>gift </I>that 

<B></B>

blackness brings to America. As a black Other's
double-hearing,
the twoness of modern African American music compromises the
singularity of
whiteness, and from it emerges a new consciousness whose
twin appearance
transforms the countenance of the nation. The implications
of this
dis-closure
unfold in the song "Let Us Cheer the Weary Traveller" that
concludes the
final
chapter. In it we hear the "fresh young voices . . . welling
up" over the
ancients "from the caverns of brick and mortar" (<I>SBF,
</I>190; <a href=2.1radano_7.html> 7</a>).

<p>
And "the traveller," who marks the turn to the twentieth
century, "sets
his face
toward the Morning, and goes his way" (<I>SBF,</I> 191).

Houston A. Baker, <I>Blues, Ideology and Afro-American
Criticism
</I>(Chicago:

significance,
as
memory; see <I>The Phenomenology of Spirit, </I>trans. A. V.
Miller,
Foreword by
J. N. Findlay (New York: Oxford University Press, 1977).
This view is
consistent
with conceptions of musical response in Romantic aesthetics,
and so it is
noteworthy that in the Introduction to this book, Baker
draws links
between music
and <I>The Phenomenology </I>in his discussion of Hegelian
blues "force."
See
also Henry Louis Gates, Jr., <I>The Signifying Monkey
</I>(New York: Oxford

</I>Gates writes: "I have tried to show how the vernacular
informs and
becomes
the foundation for formal black literature" (xxii). And in
<I>res in
Black,
</I>he continues about the spirituals:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[They] are of such import to black poetic language that when
they surface
as
referents in the poetry . . . they cannot but bear the full
emotional and
structural import of another lurking but not lost hermetic
universe.
Spirituals
as referents give black poetry an opulence of meaning--one
translated
through
time and space by an oral tradition of over three and a half
centuries--not
readily available to exterior applications. (175-76)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Baker, moreover, in <I>Blues, Ideology, </I>calls blues "the
'always
already' of
Afro-American culture ; his gestures to "iterable
diff&eacute;rance"
imply a
relation to linguistic free play and unpredictable musical
motion. Matrix
is
similarly "a point of ceasless input and output, a web of
intersecting,
crisscrossing impulses always in productive transit" . In
Baker's
<I>Modernism
and the Harlem Renaissance </I>(Chicago: The University of
Chicago Press,
1987),
hereafter abbreviated <I>MHR, </I>moreover, a sensitivity to
context
appears
together with oversimplifications of the historical process,
such as when
he
argues that the Fisk Jubilees "carried the actual sound of
Afro-American
strivings" .

the
prior aesthetic fixities of <I>Long Black Song: Essays in

and <I>Blues, Ideology, </I>and toward increasing
sensitivity to the

is "Scene . .

In his discussion of the relationship between master and

itself
the double significance of being both its own action and the
action of the
other
as well. For the other is equally independent and
self-contained, and
there is
nothing in it of which it is not itself the origin"
(111-12). Self
consciousness
accordingly requires an initial doubleness as well as
<I>recognition
</I>by an
Other. In this instance the Other is white.

</I>Du Bois acknowledges that his affinity with Africa is

Living with my mother's people I absorbed their culture

were
not African so much as Dutch and New England . . . . My

Similarly, the site of authentic black expression has also

which explains how it has been able to shift over the years,

black
music's source became increasingly associated with the inner

Few would consider today's London Underground one of the
Seven Wonders of
the
World, but that is how it was appraised by a Danish
architect in
1935.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
He was not alone in his admiration for a transport
system
that was widely seen as efficient in its operation,
progressive in its
treatment
of employees, and--perhaps most notable of all--boldly
modernist in its
corporate
appearance, from the architecture of its buildings to the
design of its
wastebins. During the interwar period the London Underground
was praised
for its
patronage of modern artists, architects, and designers, as
well as for
introducing modern art to a wide public. "The art galleries
of the
People," wrote
the art critic for the London <I>Sunday Times, </I>"are not
in Bond
Street, but
are to be found in every [Underground] station."
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
And when the
renovated Piccadilly Circus station was reopened in 1928,
one reporter
declared
that it had been "utterly transformed by modern architecture
and modern
art into
a scene that would make the perfect setting for the finale
of an opera."
(. <a href=2.1saler_1.html>1</a>
and <a href=2.1saler_2.html>2</a>)
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
"Opera" is an apposite term. During the interwar period the
London
Underground
was consciously designed to be a Wagnerian
<I>Gesamtkunstwerk, </I>a union
of the
arts that would consolidate a public divided by
industrialism and
materialism,
and provide a new source of spirituality in an increasingly
secular age.
Frank
Pick, the executive officer of the Underground who initiated
and directed
the
Underground's design and publicity, certainly admired
Wagner. Even more
than
Wagner, 

<B></B>

 however, Pick admired the two
nineteenth-century English
proponents of
the integration of art and life, John Ruskin and William
Morris. Selected
elements of Ruskin and Morris's social and aesthetic ideals
inspired Pick
to
transform the Underground into a work of public art. Indeed,
the
Underground of
the interwar period should be considered as the culminating
project of the
nineteenth-century English arts and crafts movement, a union
of the arts
designed
for the pleasure and the use of the common individual. Pick
intended the
transport system to match Morris's description of art as "a
joy to the
maker and
the user," and this was an apt description for the
Underground during the
interwar period.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Pick's achievement poses far-reaching questions for what has
come to be
one of
the most widely accepted paradigms in discussing modernism
and the
avant-garde,
Peter B&uuml;rger's distinction between a formalist and
autotelic
"modernism" and
a socially engaged "avant-garde" that opposed it during the
early twentieth
century. For B&uuml;rger, the distinctive feature of the
avant-garde was
its
critical practice in which "art was not to be simply
destroyed, but
transferred
to the praxis of life where it would be preserved, albeit in
changed
form."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Implicit within this argument is the notion that the
avant-garde, in its aim to 

<B></B>

 change
bourgeois society and culture, must
exist in
tense opposition to the prevailing cultural milieu, and will
express this
opposition in provocative, if not overtly shocking,
ways--B&uuml;rger
cites the
infamous <I>Fountain by R. Mutt </I>created by Marcel
Duchamp in 1917 as a
representative avant-garde "work." The efforts of Pick and
his numerous
associates discussed in this essay corresponded to similar
attempts by
contemporaneous avant-garde movements on the Continent such
as the Berlin
Dadaists, French Surrealists, Russian Constructivists, and
Italian
Futurists to
challenge autotelic conceptions of art.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
The most successful
embodiment of the interwar avant-garde's aim to reintegrate
art with
everyday
life (including "mass culture") was not Duchamp's ironic and
provocative
reinscription of a ready-made urinal into an "artwork," but
in fact the
"Earthly
Paradise" of the London Underground during the 1920s and
1930s. What a
transport
system might contribute to current debates about modernism
and the
avant-garde is
one subject of this essay.

<p>
The second aim of this essay is to explore modernism's
relationship with
the
past. Certainly there were modernists who broke with the
past in their
quest to
create new cultural forms that would capture the seemingly
unique
experience of
modernity. But there were also those who perceived
connections 

<B></B>

 between the
present and the past, such as Walter Benjamin, or who sought
to
reinvigorate
earlier traditions as a way to negotiate the present, such
as Ezra
Pound.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Such "usable pasts" tended to be mythopoeic
constructions of
organic communities either far removed temporally (classical
Greece and
Rome) or
spatially, situated in the "non-West" (Africa, Asia, etc.)
Pick's
indebtedness to
Ruskin and Morris points to modernism's link to a past often
considered
antithetical to it: medievalism. The story of the artistic
Underground also
illuminates this connection.

<p>
Indeed, it draws our attention to the continuing--and
surprising--influence of
Ruskin and Morris on social and aesthetic questions during
the early
twentieth
century. It is usually thought that the arts and crafts
movement faded
into a
feeble antiquarianism after Morris's death in 1896. Morris's
craft revival
was
intended to restore a common art "by the people and for the
people," but
the
elegant handicrafts he and his followers created were simply
too expensive
for
most consumers. In addition to the decline of the movement,
Ruskin and
Morris's
aesthetic theories, which stressed the moral and social
utility of art,
seemed to
be replaced in the early decades of this century by the
modernist
aesthetic of
Roger Fry and Clive Bell. This aesthetic stressed art's
autonomy;
according to
Fry and Bell, art was concerned with its own formal
properties rather than
with
its representative content. A work of art was to be judged
solely on its
"Significant Form," which elicited "aesthetic emotions" from
sensitive
viewers.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
This aesthetic formalism became the dominant way of
understanding cultural modernism through the 1960s.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
While the
definition of cultural modernism has become more complex in
recent years,
it is
still frequently defined as autonomous and self-reflexive,
concerned with
its own
formal properties at the expense of any wider social
meaning.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
This definition of cultural modernism as formalist has led
us to obscure
the
influence that Ruskin and Morris have had on the reception
of modern art
during
the interwar period. The example of Pick and the Underground
reveals that
their
aesthetic ideals continued to circulate in twentieth-century
England, and
not
just as an Underground movement. Pick was a prominent member
of a wide
network of
businessmen, artists, critics, educators, journalists and
government
officials
who attempted to adapt nineteenth-century romantic
medievalism to the
industrial
and social realities of the early twentieth century. I have
called these
individuals "medieval modernists," following the Minister of
Health, Arthur
Greenwood, when he expressed his admiration for the modern
design of the
new
Underground Headquarters to a reporter in 1931: "The
nineteenth century was
adaptable economically but not spiritually. Now we are
catching up and [I
am]
trying to be a medieval modern."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
By the 1930s the arts and crafts' dream of effacing the
distinction
between "fine
art" and "craft" (or "industrial art") had been attained, at
least
discursively--although comparatively few artists were
actually hired by
industries during the interwar period. But the hopes of Pick
and his fellow
medieval modernists to eradicate this semantic distinction,
as well as to
integrate modern art with modern life, collapsed rapidly
after
1939.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
However, if the London Underground proved not to be a
"Joy 

<B></B>

For Ever," for a brief period it was the most successful
manifestation of
an
avant-garde attempt to unite art and life, elite and mass
culture, high
modernism
and romantic medievalism.

<p>
Frank Pick and most of his fellow medieval modernists were
born in the
last third
of the nineteenth century. Many were weaned on the writings
of romantic
medievalists, particularly those of Ruskin and Morris. The
two men were
among the
most prominent of the Victorian thinkers who extolled the
Middle Ages as a
period
of organic and spiritual unity, in which art had been
integrated into
everyday
life. Damning the terminological distinction between the
so-called fine
arts and
the crafts that had been established in the Renaissance,
they urged a
return to
the medieval conception of art as simply skill or craft, the
creation by
the
common person of an artifact rightly made for its purpose.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
This
definition of art had been revived early in the nineteenth
century by the
romantic medievalist and neo-Gothic architect A. W. N.
Pugin, who wrote in
1836
that "the great test of architectural beauty is the fitness
of the design
to the
purpose for which it was intended."
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Ruskin and Morris both
accepted
and expounded upon this concept in their lectures and
published writings.
While
the two hoped to restore the socially and spiritually
integrated world
that had
supposedly existed in the Middle Ages, they did not believe
such a
community was
possible under industrial capitalism, which alienated
individuals from
each other
and from the products of their labor. As they grew older,
Ruskin and Morris
became increasingly disillusioned about the prospects for
genuine social
and
aesthetic change within their own lifetimes, but their
youthful ideal of
reintegrating art and life continued to be pursued by
others.

<p>
In the late nineteenth century there were two attempts to
integrate art
with
everyday life: the first by the followers of Ruskin and
Morris, and the
second by
the government. While Ruskin and Morris came to believe that
industrial
capitalism could not be reformed, a number of their
followers in the arts
and
crafts movement felt that industrial society could be
aestheticized and the
competitive and destructive aspects of capitalism mitigated
through the
introduction of artists into contemporary industries. J. R.
Sedding, Halsey
Ricardo, Walter Crane, and W. R. Lethaby, for example,
continued to
believe in
the social, aesthetic, and economic improvement of society
through the
integration of art and industry. At the 1888 conference of
the Art Workers'
Guild, Sedding went well beyond calling for a Morris chair
in every home,
to
calling for a William Morris in every factory: "Fancy what a
year of grace
it
were for England, if our industries were placed under the
guidance of 'one
vast
Morris'! Fancy a Morris installed in every factory. . . .
The battle of the
industries were <I>[sic] </I>half won!"
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
The government attempted to integrate art with industry in
the nineteenth
century
primarily to improve the quality of British goods for export
markets. But
there
was a fundamental difference between the aims of the
government and the
aims of
the arts and crafts movement. Members of the latter wanted
to break down
the
hierarchical distinction that elevated the fine artist over
the designer
for the
moral reason 

<B></B>

 that such a distinction
was class-based rather than natural,
and for
the very practical reason that few "fine artists" would
design for
industry if
being designated a designer meant a diminution of their
status. The
government,
in contrast, reinforced the distinction between fine artists
and designers
by
directing its industrial-art instruction and facilities
toward the
training of
artisans rather than artists. Both the Royal College of Art
and the
Victoria and
Albert Museum had originally been established to train
artisans to "apply"
art to
industry: in effect, to slap curlicues, angel's wings, or
other stock
forms onto
industrial products. Industries tended to be unimpressed by
designers
trained in
this fashion, and found it less expensive to copy popular
patterns from the
Continent themselves. Most industrialists, in fact, remained
indifferent
to the
whole issue of industrial design, complacently assuming that
assured sales
within
the Empire would maintain their profits.

<p>
At the turn of the century, many of Ruskin and Morris's
followers warned
against
such complacency, and contested the government's ineffective
program by
attaining
influential positions at the Royal College of Art, London's
Central School
of
Arts and Crafts, provincial arts schools, and important
governmental
positions,
notably within the Boards of Trade and Education. They
cautioned against
the
economic threat posed by Germany, which had embarked on an
ambitious
industrial
design-campaign inspired, ironically, by the English arts
and crafts
movement. In
1907, for example, its German admirers established the
Deutsche Werkbund to
coordinate the efforts of artists, industrialists,
educators, and the
government
in improving industrial product design. In England, however,
little had
been done
in those areas; one English design reformer recalled in
frustration that
"We
changed not only the face but the direction of German
industry. And in all
those
pre-war years those of us who were interested could make
very much less
impression on British industry."
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
Two factors, however, led to a rapid reconceptualization of
the scope and
function of art and the artist in England during the
interwar years. The
first
was Roger Fry and Clive Bell's redefinition of art as design
in the years
immediately before the war; the second was the increased
attention devoted
to the
issue of art and industry triggered by the war itself. Both
Fry and Bell's
new
aesthetic of "Significant Form" that emerged between 1910
and 1914 and the
renewed focus on the economic issue of art and industry
promoted the idea
that
the conventional separation between art and craft, fine art
and objects of
everyday use, could be overcome through the replacement of
the term "art"
with
"design." This reconceptualization was widely supported by
artists,
educators,
government officials, critics, and design reformers during
the 1920s and
1930s.
By 1934, the art critic Anthony Bertram could state that
"the recent
extension of
the word 'design' is one of the most interesting and
significant
indications of
the whole trend of good modern thought. It is fast becoming
one of the most
inclusive words in the vocabulary."
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Fry vigorously promoted this redefinition of art as "design"
through the
two
postimpressionist exhibitions he had organized in London in
1910 and 1912,
as
well as through a series of lectures and essays. These,
together with his
friend
Clive Bell's influential <I>Art </I>, argued that
design was the
element
common to all aesthetic 

<B></B>

 artifacts, be
they painting or pots. The two men
abolished the hierarchical distinction between a work of art
and a work of
craft;
art and design, in their aesthetic, became synonymous.

<p>
While Fry and Bell agreed with Morris's contention that the
distinction
between
art and craft was false, neither agreed with Morris's belief
that all
genuine art
was also useful--indeed, Fry and Bell were reacting against
this
conception of
art, which they associated with the moral and utilitarian
aesthetic of the
Victorians.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Both men were uninterested in looking at machine
products as potential works of art. Nevertheless, their
redefinition of
art as
design contributed to the effacement of the distinction
between fine art
and
industrial art in the interwar period. The 1910
postimpressionist
exhibition had
been a <I>succ&egrave;s de scandale, </I>but as is often the
case with
avant-garde movements, the succeeding exhibition in 1912 was
a
<I>succ&egrave;s
d'estime. </I>As a result, "fine artists" who eked out an
existence
painting and
sculpting became more willing to identify themselves as
designers, as this
term
no longer implied a derogation of their artistic status.
Painters and
sculptors
could conceivably be integrated into most English industries
with a
minimum of
specialized training, as these industries were craft-based
rather than
highly
technical in nature: the design of furniture, pottery,
hosiery, jewelry,
and
textiles did not require extensive training, and offered
artists
much-needed
income during the economic crises of the interwar period.

<p>
This redefinition of art as design, and the artist as
designer, was rapidly
assimilated into public discussions about art. In 1932
<I>The Listener
</I>marveled that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We have artists of the stature of Henry Moore, Vanessa Bell,
and John Nash
turning quite naturally from painting a picture or carving a
statue to
designing
a lampstand or a wall-paper or a book cover. And we have Mr.
Roger Fry's
word for
it . . . that these are but representative of a great number
of sensitive
and
gifted artists.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Fry and Bell's new aesthetic vocabulary appealed to those
who were
searching for
a way to comprehend the often bewildering expressions of
modernism. It
provided
educators, for example, with a new lexicon to explain art
forms that were
radically different from the Victorian's narrative art.
Their
effectiveness in
explaining the new art in the new terms that emphasized form
and design
over
content can be seen in the shift in attitudes toward modern
art and
children's
art. In 1910 modern art was often derisively compared to the
scribbles of
children,
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
whereas by the 1930s children's art was often being
praised for its likeness to modern art. Reflecting on this
transition, a
member
of the Local Education Authority in Kent noted in 1935 that
"the emphasis
is
changing in the teaching of art in schools from
representational technique
to an
attempt to get children to sum up the essential character of
an object. .
. . A
good deal of attention is paid to colour, composition, and
design."
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
The second factor contributing to the interwar redefinition
of art as
design was
the new economic significance accorded to industrial art
during and after
the
First World War. If "design" was given a more inclusive
meaning as a
result of
Fry and Bell's new aesthetic, it was elevated to an issue of
national
importance
due to the economic pressures engendered by the war. The
drain on overseas
investments and 

<B></B>

 loss of export
revenues caused by the conflict meant that
exports
would have to play an even greater role than usual in the
postwar recovery.
"Industrial art" and "design" thus became associated with
patriotism:
improving
English design was seen as a way to combat Germany on the
economic front,
as well
as to reclaim the English origins of the industrial design
movement from
the
pilfering Hun. During the war, the Board of Trade set up the
British
Institute
for Industrial Art to encourage the improvement of
industrial design. This
was
welcomed by the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum,
Sir Cecil
Smith, who
noted that "the very terminology of to-day which
discriminates between
'Fine
Art'. . . and 'Decorative' or 'Industrial' art, is an
unfortunate misnomer
of
purely modern origin."
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
The Board of Education, too,
considered the
integration of art and industry a national priority. Its
president
appointed
William Rothenstein, a painter and vocal advocate of Ruskin
and Morris's
social
aesthetic, to head the Royal College of Art in 1920, with
the aim of
training
artists to be industrial designers. Rothenstein hired the
painter Paul
Nash to
teach in the RCA's Design School, and his policy of
integrating fine- and
industrial-art training was supported by the Board of
Education through
the early
1930s.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
And in 1919 the Ministry of Reconstruction published a
pamphlet, "Art and Industry," that appeared to make the
views of Ruskin and
Morris into national policy: "Art is generally understood to
be a thing
apart. It
is 'applied' or 'fine' (two of the most ignorant and
misleading terms ever
invented) according as it is useful or not. We must work for
the
restoration of
the broader meaning of art--one and indivisible in its
association with
life and
work."
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
During and after the First World War, therefore, art and
artists were
assigned an
important social role, challenging the romantic image of the
artist as
outsider.
Arguing for the social function of the modern artist as a
designer for
industry,
Paul Nash noted that "the economic problem of the artist
today is
distinctly
precarious, [but] it may be possible to regard the artist in
a new light,
that of
a member of the community."
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Nash frequently described
himself as a
"designer" rather than as a painter or "fine artist," and
argued
vigorously for
the integration of art and life in <I>Room and Book
</I>. In a 1933
letter
to the <I>Times, </I>he predicted that the term "fine
artist" would soon
disappear entirely: "the professional artist of the future
would be a
professional designer."
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
And while Wyndham Lewis differed
from most
medieval modernists in his elitist and antidemocratic views,
he too argued
for
the unity and social function of the arts. In this he seems
to have been
influenced by Pick's associate W. R. Lethaby, a fervent
disciple of Ruskin
and
Morris, as well as one of the earliest proponents in England
of modern
architecture and industrial design.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
In <I>The Caliph's Design
</I> Lewis asked, "Why does not the Architect . . .
--why does not
this
strange absentee, this shadow, this Ghost of the great
Trinity, Sculpture,
Painting, and Architecture--for which I have substituted
Design . . .
<I>why does
he not cheer us up by Building a New Arena?</I>"
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Thus while
Fry and
Bell had used "design" to disassociate the function, form,
and content of
art
from everyday life, many artists used the term to reaffirm
art's social
function,
undermining aesthetic formalism with its own terms. 

<B></B>

<p>
Art teachers, no less than artists, supported the
redefinition of art.
Many were
lower-middle-class women who were poorly paid, undervalued,
and
overworked; the
integration of the arts offered their profession an enhanced
social
status. They
would contribute to the aestheticization of everyday life
and to the
creation of
well-designed commodities through educating the public. It
was crucial,
they
felt, to counter the disparaging comments that many critics
had initially
leveled
against the new art. The postimpressionist artists had been
attacked in
1910 for
rejecting the polished technique of the Academy, but
educators saw the
apparent
lack of technique in a positive light: the new art could be
produced by
ordinary
individuals as it had been in the Middle Ages, rather than
restricted to
academically trained "fine artists." It was precisely the
seemingly
spontaneous
and informal qualities of the new art that encouraged
educators to promote
postimpressionism as the new mass art for the new mass age.
In 1928 H. J.
R.
Murray, an Inspector of Schools, underscored this
egalitarian shift in
attitude
toward art education: "It has become orthodox to believe
that drawing is a
natural form of expression or language and as such is the
heritage of every
child. In other words drawing is not an accomplishment to be
permitted to a
talented few, but an integral and necessary part of any
complete system of
education."
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
Art was no longer understood to be either a minor subject,
rapidly
forgotten
after primary school, or one associated with middle-class
dilettantism.
Art was
now depicted as a discipline crucial to the moral,
spiritual, and economic
welfare of the nation. Through art education, teachers would
elevate their
charges' sensibilities, thereby forming discriminating
consumers who would
in
turn demand well-designed articles from recalcitrant
manufacturers. At the
1928
International Congress for Art Education, teachers stressed
that the
public must
receive such training in order to render the modern world of
commerce and
industry humane: "Many of the amenities of life have been
lost during the
transition from hand to machine production and can only be
regained by the
control of industry by an aesthetically educated public
opinion."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
The public need not consist of passive consumers of goods
manipulatively
retailed
by the "Culture Industry," as certain Frankfurt School
theorists
maintained at
this time. Instead, the public would have a significant
voice in the
creation of
culture through the power of purchase: consumption could be
equated with
production.

<p>
Government committees, charged with investigating how
Britain's industrial
art
could be improved, and frustrated with the reluctance both
of industries
to hire
trained designers and local authorities to provide effective
training in
industrial design, accepted the educators' arguments. As one
government
committee
concluded, "education in appreciation of industrial
aesthetics must be
carried on
before there is to be any perceptible upward trend in the
quality of
British
industrial design."
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
In 1937 the Board of Education revised
their
<I>Handbook of Suggestions for Teachers in Elementary
Schools </I>by
combining
the two separate chapters on "Drawing" and "Handwork" of the
1927 edition
into a
single chapter on "Art and Craft." The new handbook stated
that "Art and
Handicraft are not two separate sections of the curriculum
which imply
different
outlooks: they should properly be regarded as part and
parcel of one
important
branch of teaching."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
The interwar redefinition of art as "design" was furthered
by the
intercession of
numerous groups of art enthusiasts and design reformers who
arose to
educate the
public about art's social relevance. Among these groups were
the British
Institute for Industrial Art, the Contemporary Art
Association, the Allied
Artists Association, the Imperial Arts League, the Arts
League of Service,
the
Society of Industrial Artists, the British Institute for
Adult Education,
and the
most influential, the Design and Industries Association
(DIA), formed in
1915.
Modeled on the Deutsche Werkbund, the DIA consisted of
prominent artists,
businessmen, critics, and educators dedicated to instructing
the public
about the
economic and moral utility of art. Through the writings and
activities of
many of
its members, the DIA consciously set out to make the
romantic-medieval
ideals of
Ruskin and Morris applicable to modern industry and art.
While its
membership was
small, many of the DIA's aims and beliefs were frequently
reiterated by
medieval
modernists in education, journalism, government, industry,
and the
artworld. Not
all members of the DIA appreciated modern art, but there
were many, like
Frank
Pick or the art critic Herbert Read, who interpreted visual
modernism as
the new
"living art" that expressed the spirit of the modern age,
the very art that
Morris had eagerly anticipated in his writings but did not
live to see. As
Read
argued in 1934, "Morris, for his day, was as extreme as any
modern artist
. . . .
Morris to-day would be by the side of Le Corbusier in
architecture,
Picasso in
painting, and probably Stalin in politics. The spirit of the
man was
fundamentally revolutionary."
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
While DIA members thought of themselves as the genuine heirs
of Ruskin and
Morris, they rejected their forerunners' pessimism about
industrialization.
Disillusion with commerce and industry had led Ruskin to
reactionary social
views, and Morris to revolutionary ones, but DIA members,
many of whom
came from
industrial towns in the north, learned to stop worrying and
love the
machine. The
increasing collectivization of society and the apparent
mastery of men over
technics in the early decades of the twentieth century
suggested that an
organic
and spiritual community might be established along meliorist
rather than
revolutionary lines. The machine was, in their view, just
the latest
version of
an artisanal tool, and if artists could master it, then
Morris's Earthly
Paradise
could be attained. Like many of the DIA's views, this
redefinition of the
machine
was shared by those who were not formally members of the
organization: for
example, in his introduction to an edition of Morris's
writings, G. D. H.
Cole
noted that Morris had been "blind, for the most part, to the
pleasure
which a man
can take in a machine that he helps to do its intricate work
well . . . .
There
is no fixed line between the spheres of handicraft and
machinework."
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
The compatibility between handicraft and machinework,
formalism and
functionalism
was furthered through the revival of the nineteenth-century
romantic-medieval
definition of art as expressing "Fitness for Purpose." The
DIA adopted
this as
their motto and promoted it so zealously that even the
Prince of Wales
invoked it
as art's defining characteristic in the early 1930s.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Pick and
others combined this romantic-medieval aesthetic with the
modernist
aesthetic of
Significant Form, thereby 

<B></B>

 enabling
them to acknowledge the formal
properties of
the new art while still grounding postimpressionist art
within Victorian
social
and utilitarian parameters.

<p>
"Fitness for Purpose" thus had the advantage of situating
the new and
bewildering
artistic styles within a very English context, in contrast
to the
apparently
"French" aestheticism of Fry and his friends. One founding
member of the
DIA
criticized the Bloomsbury aesthetic as elitist in both
content and
expression:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A proper function of criticism should be to foster our
national arts and
not to
frighten people off with high-pitched definitions and
far-fetched
metaphors mixed
with a flood of (as Morris said) "sham technical twaddle."
It is a pity to
make a
mystery of what should most easily be understood. There is
nothing occult
about
the thought that all     things may be made well
or made ill.
A work
of ar is a well-made thing, that is all.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Whereas Fry and Bell tended to describe art in abstract
aesthetic terms,
referring to a work's "plastic rhythms" and "contrapuntal
formal
harmonies," the
DIA and their followers discussed art in more practical
terms, pointing to
the
fact that the geometrical forms of cubism were especially
suited to the
requirements of machine production, or that the simple, flat
images and
strong
primary colors of a Matisse were especially fit for the
purposes of
advertising
posters, which needed to create an instant impression on
commuters.
"Fitness for
Purpose" provided a normative and practical measure by which
the new art
could be
evaluated, and this was part of the slogan's wide appeal.
Harry Peach, a
DIA
member and close friend of Pick's, thought the slogan should
be mentioned
as
often as possible in DIA publicity "as the public could
understand [it],
and we
are all asking for some test on which to judge things by."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

<p>
"Fitness for Purpose" was also reassuring to those who
feared that modern
art
represented a radical subjectivism and self-indulgence that
threatened the
Protestant work ethic, and would lead to a breakdown of
communal standards
and to
cultural anarchy.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
In a generally favorable review of the
avant-garde group <I>Unit One, </I>the architect
Goodhart-Rendel
articulated a
common sentiment when he cautioned that "The artist that
keeps his art
only as a
partner in his self-expression condemns it to the
infertility of a harlot.
The
expression of his precious self should never be his object,
it should be
the
least conscious part of his labour in some definite task."
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
But
"Fitness for Purpose" contained the new art within the
earlier Victorian
rhetoric
of duty, service, and responsibility. By linking modern art
with Fitness
for
Purpose and industrial production, visual modernism was made
to appear less
anarchic, subjective, and alienating, and more
comprehensible, moral, and
socially beneficial. Medieval modernists maintained that
once artists were
integrated into industry and obeyed the mandate of "Fitness
for Purpose,"
they
would be working for the benefit of the community as artists
had done in
the
Middle Ages, rather than jeopardizing the commonweal by
brashly
celebrating their
own egoism.

<p>
In addition to adapting the aesthetic of Significant Form to
the aesthetic
of
Fitness for Purpose, the DIA attempted to reconcile other
fundamental
tenets of
the arts and crafts tradition with the modern industrial
world. This took
some
imaginative 

<B></B>

 reworking of Ruskin and
Morris's writings, but DIA members and
their
fellow medieval modernists had proven themselves equal to
the challenge by
redefining machines as the modern equivalent of artisanal
tools. Still,
some
concepts proved harder to adapt than others. For example,
the DIA took
Ruskin's
famous emphasis on "Joy in Labor," which he believed
pertained to the
experience
of medieval artisans but not to modern factory workers, and
transformed it
to
"Joy in Service." Industrial workers could take pride in the
service they
provided to the community, and such pride would be
sufficient compensation
for
having to work within a system of subdivided labor.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>

<p>
DIA members and other medieval modernists also argued that
mass-produced
commodities need not be thought of as inferior to
individually crafted
works of
art, as Ruskin and Morris had believed they were. While the
German critic
Walter
Benjamin argued that the aura of art was lost in the age of
mechanical
reproduction, many of his English contemporaries believed
that industrial
products could be imbued with the spirit of the industrial
artist. As
Frank Pick
stated, "We think of ourselves as vessels of the spirit of
God, so things,
we may
say, are receptacles of the spirit of man. When they are
full of the
spirit,
things have souls--God's gift to us, man's gift to them."
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
The new art's spiritual effects were emphasized as often as
its economic
benefits. In its emphasis on abstract qualities such as
form, balance,
composition, and harmonic "rhythms" over the mimetic
representation of the
everyday, postimpressionism seemed to express the eternal
forms underlying
the
transient surface appearances of life. Like medieval
paintings and
stained-glass
windows, the new art called the viewers' attention to the
integrated and
immutable order of the universe, which appeared to have been
lost sight of
in the
fragmented, skeptical, and secular world of the early
twentieth century.
One
writer argued in 1921 that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
However strange and repellent this newer art may appear to
those of us
brought up
in the safe paths of tradition I cannot help welcoming the
new vision as an
indication of the younger generation's demand for a more
ordered and
permanent
aspect of life. The study of modern art has brought to me
the comforting
hope
that the coming generation will understand the meaning of
life and reality
and
will therefore be wiser than     the
generations which brought
Europe to the catastrophe of 1914.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Many of the medieval modernists asserted that the platonic
"forms" and
invisible
"rhythms" expressed by nonrepresentational art were also
being revealed by
contemporary explorations in science. Abstract art seemed to
radiate the
invisible cosmic forces that had been discovered by the new
physics at the
turn
of the century, and to represent the mysterious Fourth
Dimension posited by
late-nineteenth-century non-Euclidian geometry.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Indeed, the
so-called nonrepresentational art of the postimpressionists
could thus be
seen as
mimetic: if, as Ruskin had said, all genuine art must be
true to Nature,
this
modern art was precisely true to the Nature revealed by
modern science.
Herbert
Read spoke for many when he asserted that "Art is a
<I>natural
</I>activity. Its
rules are the proportions and rhythms inherent in our
universe."
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
The Earthly Paradise of the medieval modernists could
embrace commerce and
industry within its ambit, as both would be spiritualized by
the
transcendental
agency of art. Pick, for example, believed that commerce
overshadowed
religion as
the principal bond among people in the modern world, but
that commerce
need not
be incompatible with spiritual principles: "I seek behind
commerce, art
and I
know that behind art there must be good custom. Morality, we
call
it."
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
With modern artists integrated into industry, English
industrial products would be transformed from the cheap and
shoddy to the
cheap
and lovely, the new "common art" for the commercial and
democratic age.
Indeed,
Pick and other medieval modernists believed that by
integrating modern
artists
into industry, England would not only evolve into an Earthly
Paradise, but
an
Earthly Paradise that happened to dominate the world's
export markets
through the
sale of its "soulful" commodities. Morris's utopian <I>Dream
of John Ball
</I>could mesh with the economic Dream of John Bull.

<p>
Medieval modernists also stressed those qualities of the new
art that would
appeal to a country whose iconoclastic Protestant heritage
had long
disparaged
the visual in favor of the verbal. In England, visual
modernism was
frequently
characterized as a puritan art, its pure, simple, and
austere designs
connoting
the eternal realm of the Heavenly Kingdom. Protestant
readers of Clive
Bell's
<I>Art </I>could take reassurance from his assertion that if
art is a
religion,
"it is a religion without a priesthood."
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Many of those who
were
instrumental in promoting the new art, such as Frank Pick,
Charles Holden,
Roger
Fry, and Samuel Courtauld, came from nonconformist
backgrounds, with a
substantial number raised in Quaker households. This
convergence of
puritanism
and postimpressionism did not pass unnoticed; the artist C.
R. W.
Nevinson, for
example, observed that "in England, where the seventh
commandment is most
reverenced, many of the greatest lovers of this dehumanized
art were either
Quakers or Methodists by birth, and they were always
suspicious of the
flesh or
any sensuous appeal."
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
Region and class, no less than religion, contributed to the
interwar
struggle to
define the new art in primarily formalist or social terms.
Many medieval
modernists were raised in the North, and their attempt to
modify the
aesthetic of
"Significant Form" was related to long-established cultural
tensions
between
North and South.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Northern civic pride reflected both a
celebration
of local avant-gardism in industry and a reaction against
the centralizing
pull
of London.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
It is therefore not surprising that Northerners
would
embrace those cultural forms that challenged the staid
orthodoxy and social
exclusivity of London's Royal Academy, while simultaneously
denying that
art was
autonomous. At the opening of a 1911 modern art exhibit in
Manchester,
Robert
Ross of the Contemporary Art Society reminded his provincial
audience that
modern
art was "either very partially recognized or wholly
unrecognized by
officialism,
particularly London officialism. There is some reason for us
to make our
debut in
Manchester. For what Manchester thinks to-day about a good
many things
besides
art England is apt to think to-morrow, or at least the day
after
to-morrow."
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps the high-water mark of the integration of the arts
during the
interwar
period occurred in 1935, when an exhibition of "Art in
Industry" was held
at the 

<B></B>

Royal Academy. The Royal Academy had been the last bastion
of the "fine
arts."
Their refusal in the nineteenth century to display craftwork
had led to the
formation of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1888.
The 1935
exhibition
marked the belated victory of the arts and crafts project to
recognize
art's
social function, and was celebrated as such. A contemporary
noted that "A
common
interest in good work breaks down all unreal distinctions,
and the
authorities of
the Royal Academy . . . have, in organizing this Exhibition,
broken down
all the
artificial barriers that have hitherto separated the Fine
Arts from the
Industrial Arts."
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The challenge to the hierarchical
distinctions
among the arts was at times taken to extremes: one critic
opined that "the
contemplation of cutlery has never given me a sense of
immortality.
Nevertheless,
I maintain that the difference between a well-designed fork
and
Botticelli's
<I>Primavera </I>is one of degree and not kind."
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
Less extreme
definitions of art as simply a well-made artifact fit for
its purpose were
common, however, as were appreciative references to Ruskin
and Morris. The
architect W. R. Lethaby stated in 1919 that Ruskin's thought
"saturates
this
generation through and through"
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
and Anthony Bertram observed
in
1938 that "it was Morris who took art out of the academies
and brought it
again
into everyday life. . . . [but] it has taken nearly half a
century for
these
ideas to percolate into the ideology of our times."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

<p>
But although the traditional definition of art had been
successfully
challenged
in public discourse during the interwar period, the
<I>actual
</I>integration of
art and industry had yet to be realized. In his report on
the state of
industrial
art in England in 1936, Nikolaus Pevsner had to admit that
"things are
extremely
bad. When I say that 90 per cent of British industrial art
is devoid of any
aesthetic merit, I am not exaggerating."
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Most industries
remained
uninterested in design, most local authorities remained
uncertain as to
how to
reform their art schools, the Royal College of Art remained
a producer
primarily
of art teachers rather than trained designers, the Board of
Education
remained
unable to enforce its programmatic recommendations, and the
public
remained much
discussed but little consulted as to its habits of
consumption.

<p>
This discrepancy between ideals and reality can in part be
explained by the
decentralized nature of English industrial art education,
which impeded
comprehensive reform programs, and the continued complacency
of most
industries
toward the issue of industrial art. In addition, the attempt
to integrate
art
with industry was stymied by the conflicting motives of the
design
reformers
themselves: utopian aspirations often clashed with economic
goals. Design
reformers argued that England's economic future depended on
satisfactory
industrial design, but many were less concerned about
elevating export
res
than with diffusing art throughout the country so as to
create the New
Jerusalem.
As chairman of the government's Council of Art and Industry
(CAI) during
the
1930s, Frank Pick was quick to argue that "the industrial
future of the
United
Kingdom must to a large and increasing extent be bound up
with the
development of
design."
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
But like most interwar design reformers he wanted
to see
that the "right" types of design were available to the
public--designs not
only
fit for purpose, but that also embodied the transcendental
aura of the
artist and
tapped 

<B></B>

 into national traditions.
Moral judgments, rather than market
research,
governed the evaluation of design. Pick had the CAI
concentrate on
"typical"
English industries like sporting goods, pottery, furniture,
silverwork, and
clothing as a way to "escape, if we can, from what I would
call the
Continental
influences which now seek to pervade certain branches of
industry. I do
not think
we can hope to be successful unless we build up a tradition
for ourselves
and
make our English design of international reputation."
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
This top-down approach contrasted markedly with the more
consumer-oriented
design
profession in America, which used market research methods to
determine
what the
public wanted.
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Gordon Russell, a prominent designer of the
period,
expressed the English industrial artist's opposition to this
tactic:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
An American super-stylist stated some time ago that he was
surprised to
find in
England that people talked of aesthetics in connection with
industrial
design:
aesthetics, he said, had nothing to do with it, the only
test was a
beautiful
sales curve shooting upwards. I know there are some knaves
and morons in
industry, but such nonsense presupposes that there is no one
else. . . .
The
problem is a social one, as William Morris saw. Good design
is one aspect
of a
good pattern of life and unless the foundations are sound
the
superstructure will
not last.
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
While there were a few English industrialists who shared
this moral
reformist
attitude, many others may have been reluctant to hire
industrial artists
precisely because the English design movement seemed overly
idealistic,
even
quixotic.

<p>
The moral conception of design meant that designers in
interwar England
were
trained as "artists" rather than as technicians familiar
with the
specialized
requirements of designing for particular industries. The
industrial artist
of the
1920s and 1930s was a special type of employee, in the world
of commerce
but not
of it, one who was meant to "civilize" commerce and to
spiritualize
industrial
commodities. While individual designers like Lewis Day or B.
J. Fletcher
did not
think this exalted role was incompatible with a solid
vocational training,
many
others did: the job could be fulfilled only through the
gifts of an artist,
rather than through the narrow training of a technician.
Thus in England
the
"designer" was caught between the cultural demand that he be
an artist and
the
industrial demand that he be a specialist. This tension was
nicely
captured in D.
H. Lawrence's Women in Love , in a conversation
between the art
teacher
Gudrun Brangwen and Loerke, a German sculptor and occasional
industrial
artist:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And do you think then," said
Gudrun, "that
<BR>
art should serve industry?"

<p>
The cultural imperative prevailed, impelled by the fact that
those who had
been
raised in the arts and crafts tradition obtained positions
of power within
the
government, education, and industry. In addition, industrial
art derived
its
conceptual foundations from nearly a century's worth of
experience with the
traditional "craft-based" 

<B></B>

 industries,
for which artists could create
designs
without extensive technical training. British industrial
investment
continued to
be focused on these staple industries during the interwar
years, rather
than on
the new light-metal industries being developed at the time.
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
Thus
discussions on improving the training of designers tended to
focus on how
artists
could learn the technical requirements of such traditional
industries as
textiles, pottery, furniture, clothing, and jewelry. As late
as 1936 Pick
himself
believed that the CAI did not need to investigate
engineering industries,
because
he felt that they did not depend on design for sales in the
way that more
traditional craft-based industries did.
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
In the interwar
period,
industrial design as it was practiced in America simply was
not a
conceptual
possibility in England.

<p>
&#009;The London Underground, however, was a concrete
realization of the
integration of art and industry so widely touted in print
but so often
flouted in
life. Pick attempted to turn it into an arts and crafts
project, a
microcosmic
example of what he hoped to do with all of London.

<p>
But while Pick had a moment of success in actualizing this
dream, neither
his
more grandiose goal of reshaping London into an orderly and
harmonious
community
nor the discursive union of the arts that he helped to shape
lasted beyond
the
interwar period. By 1945 a clear separation between "fine
art" and
"industrial
design" was reestablished within public rhetoric, and was
institutionalized
through the creation of the Arts Council on the one hand,
and the Council
of
Industrial Design on the other. Indeed, Pick was not just a
central re
in the
establishment of the medieval modernist conception of art;
he also played
a major
role in its sudden collapse. It is to a more specific
account of his
efforts in
both of these directions that we shall now turn.

<p>
Recent literature has depicted Pick as an idealistic yet
shrewd
businessman who
promoted modern art primarily as an advertising strategy to
increase the
Underground's profits.
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
It is true that Pick was concerned
with
maintaining corporate revenues. But like his hero John
Ruskin, he adhered
to the
puritan conception of business as a spiritual calling that
emphasized
service
over profit. He consistently maintained this view, from his
earliest
writings as
a youth in the 1890s, to his speeches as the vice-chairman
of the London
Public
Transportation Board (LPTB) in the 1930s. As he told a
gathering in 1929,
"the
financial results of an undertaking, while of marked
importance I cannot
deny,
certainly in a transport undertaking which performs a public
service, do
not
represent the main purpose of the undertaking."
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
That main
purpose?
As he repeatedly maintained, "We are in being to perform
service and
service and
service."
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
Pick intended the Underground to improve people's
lives.
He used posters to inform commuters of cultural and
educational events of
which
they might otherwise be unaware, turned Underground stations
into
mini-museums of
modern design, and was delighted with statistics that showed
attendance at
museums and zoos increased whenever Underground stations
opened within
their
vicinity.
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
Pick's emphasis on service stemmed from both his Protestant
upbringing and
lower-middle-class background. The son of a tradesman, he
was born in 1878,
raised a Congregationalist, and spent his formative years in
York, which
he felt
could be 

<B></B>

 grasped as a civic community
in a way that London could not. He
would
pursue his lifelong quest for "social solidarity" with York
in mind, just
as he
would defend commerce and industry as "noble" pursuits with
his father in
mind
(provided that such pursuits elevated minds as well as
profits).
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
As
he was to explain in 1916, "The great advantage of business
is not the
pursuit of
profit. The great advantage of business is the pursuit of
art."
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
As a youth he avidly read Ruskin and Morris, and remained
for most of his
life a
romantic who believed that the new art expressed the
underlying spirit of
the
modern world. By diffusing modern art among the populace he
hoped to
recreate a
spiritual and organic community such as that which had
supposedly existed
during
the Middle Ages. When he became a leader of one of the
largest
corporations of
the country he tried to realize his vision of an Earthly
Paradise: the
Underground would be a model of aesthetic integration and
communal
service, a
catalyst for a more harmonious London of the future. He
stated in 1926,
"We have
to establish a new social synthesis. We have to make the
conflicting
interests of
the people serve some commonweal. We cannot neglect one
great aid to this,
which
is a city laid out and constructed to embody this end."
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<p>
When he moved to London in 1906 to work for the Underground,
by luck he was
assigned to work directly with the new general manager,
Albert Stanley,
later
Lord Ashfield. Ashfield, who recognized Pick's managerial
abilities, was
only too
happy to exploit his employee's workaholic personality. Pick
rapidly became
Ashfield's second-in-command, overseeing the day-to-day
management of the
system
while Ashfield concentrated on the wider worlds of politics
and finance.
Both men
were mavericks, and Pick was given wide latitude in his
decisions; as far
as
Ashfield was concerned, as long as Pick ensured that the
system ran
smoothly, he
could do what he liked with the Underground's appearance.
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>

<p>
Pick began to shape the image of the Underground without any
overall
social plan.
He decided that the Underground ought to have a corporate
identity as a
way to
sell it to the public, but also as a way to identify the
system in the
public's
mind as an integrated entity, a microcosm of the organic
unity he sought in
society. In 1913 he hired the arts and crafts typographer
Edward Johnston
to
design a special typeface for the Underground that would
give a distinctive
visual identity to the system, combining tradition with
modernity. At this
time
Pick also began to commission artists to design posters,
many in the latest
modernist styles. He believed that abstract art was "fit for
the purpose"
of
advertising, since, as mentioned above, it conveyed concepts
more rapidly
than
traditional narrative art. In addition, modern art jolted
jaded city
dwellers out
of their conventional habits of seeing, forcing them to view
the world
afresh
with the innocent eye so valued by the romantics.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>

<img align=right hspace=5 height=125
src=thumb/2.1saler_3t.gif
alt=IMAGE LINK></a>

The Underground posters were instrumental in introducing the
public to
modern
art, and accounts in the press praised Pick for turning the
system into
"the
people's picture-gallery."
<sup><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
His audacious experiment proved so
successful in generating favorable publicity that it was
emulated by other
several other institutional undertakings and corporations
such as
Shell-Mex, the
Cunard Liners, the General Post Office, and 

<B></B>

 the Empire Marketing Board
(Pick
himself was commissioned to chair the Poster Subcommittee).
The Underground
posters helped introduce the latest artistic styles to the
provinces as
well as
to those residing in London (. <a
href=2.1saler_3.html>3</a> and
<a href=2.1saler_4.html>4</a>). In 1926 Pick
suggested that
the
Victoria and Albert Museum circulate reproductions of the
posters to
provincial
art schools, where contemporary art was nearly invisible,
and two years
later
officials at the museum noted the venture's success: "The
poster movement
. . .
is so progressive, and the demand for this kind of work in
provincial
Schools is
so great, that a gift of drawings of this nature is greatly
appreciated by
us."
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>

<p>
In the 1920s, Pick was encouraged to think of the
Underground as a
catalyst for
social integration by his colleagues at the Design and
Industries
Association.
Among the DIA members who most influenced Pick was W. R.
Lethaby. In a
series of
lectures published as <I>Form in Civilisation </I>in 1922,
Lethaby called
for a
new architectural style that would capture the spirit of the
modern age
and make
London more visually cohesive. Pick had been thinking along
similar lines
about
the need for an environmental catalyst that would promote
social
integration. In
1923 the 

<B></B>

 Underground received
permission to extend southward, and Pick
decided
that the design of the new stations would meet Lethaby's
call for a
contemporary
school of architecture.
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
As the new stations were being built
in
1926, Pick promised an audience that "a new style of
architectural
decoration
will arise" and that it would herald "modern London--modern,
not garbled
classic
or renaissance."
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>

<p>
The architect Pick chose to design the new style, Charles
Holden, was also
a DIA
member, also from Yorkshire, also a nonconformist, also an
admirer of
Ruskin and
Morris, and who also saw modern art as embodying the new
collective spirit.
Holden designed the stations in the International style that
had been
visible on
the continent in the 1920s but was virtually unknown in
England. He also
commissioned modern sculptures by Henry Moore, Jacob
Epstein, and others
for the
Underground headquarters he designed in 1929. He insisted
that the
sculptors
carve directly onto the stone of the building, rather than
use plaster
casts, as
direct carvings had been the practice in the Middle Ages.
Like other of his
colleagues, Holden overtly compared modernism and
medievalism; for example
he
defended Epstein's controversial 

<B></B>

sculpture Day because it was "alive and
vigorous
like much medieval sculpture and that is what I most value."
<sup><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>

<p>
<a name=5 href=2.1saler_5.html>
<img align=right hspace=5 height=125
src=thumb/2.1saler_5t.gif
alt=IMAGE LINK></a>

Just as they defined modernism in terms of medievalism, Pick
and Holden
consciously adapted the International style to native
traditions. For
example,
Holden's functional architecture contained touches of
ornamentation,
unlike many
of the starker buildings on the continent, as both he and
Pick believed
that this
was part of the English tradition. At least one reviewer
felt Holden had
been
successful; anticipating that some might claim that a
station by Holden "is
un-English," the reviewer countered, "True, its constituent
elements are as
international as concrete and cantilevers, but the spirit in
which they are
assembled is wholly English."
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
Several of Holden's
functionalist
buildings have been likened to English cathedrals; perhaps
the most obvious
example is the Uxbridge station of 1938, which has a
stained-glass window
above
the booking hall (<a href=2.1saler_5.html> 5</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
Holden also designed many of the
buildings' fixtures, thereby fulfilling the arts and crafts
ideal of the
architect as master craftsman who created an integrated work
of art.

<p>
In addition to unifying the Underground's surface
appearance, Pick also
tried to
secure optimal working conditions for its employees.
<sup><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
The
Underground was widely praised for its services and its art;
nevertheless,
Pick's
ambitions were not 

<B></B>

 satisfied.
<sup><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
He wanted to use the
Underground to
influence the growth and form of London, for in his eyes the
transport
system
determined the shape of the city.
<sup><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
With the creation of the
London
Passenger Transportation Board in 1933, Pick believed he had
at hand the
instrument that would shape the London of the future: the
Board brought
together
ninety-two different transport undertakings within a single
nongovernmental
authority, under public inspection. Ashfield was chairman of
the
seven-member
board, with Pick as vice-chairman and chief executive
officer. They were
charged
with expanding the entire transport system, and given
&#163;40,OOO,OOO to
do it.
Pick also was made chairman of the government's Council on
Art and
Industry,
established in 1934 to promote the integration of the two
areas.

<p>
It is at this juncture that Pick was derailed. He found that
he did not
have as
much autonomy as a member of the Transportation Board as he
had at the
Underground. He had to compromise with the other members of
the board,
which was
itself checked by other public agencies. In addition, Pick's
dreams of
reshaping
London would have required a central planning agency to
coordinate myriad
public
and private interests; such a national agency did not exist
in the 1930s.
Finally, the transport system itself was facing financial
difficulties, as
well
as increased competition for traffic from automobiles.

<p>
It was also at this time that Pick became disenchanted with
modern art.
Initially
he had welcomed it as a spiritual force that would help
integrate the body
public, but over time visual modernism seemed to him
increasingly anarchic
and
individualistic. He had hoped that the artist would
subordinate
self-expression
to the greater good of society by becoming a servant to
industry and
following
the constraints embodied in the Eleventh Commandment of
"Fitness for
Purpose."
The 1936 opening of the Surrealist Exhibition in London had
appalled
Pick--he
thought the art immoral and degenerate. A devout
nonconformist, Pick
perceived
surrealism as the hedonistic glorification of the self
rather than as an
art fit
for a higher purpose. In July 1937 he wrote to a friend, "I
have come to
the
conclusion that practically all modernistic methods are bad
and that we
must go
back a long way and build again on the old foundations. I am
certainly not
going
to encourage modern art anymore myself."
<sup><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
Pick used his power
as
chairman of the CAI to redefine the industrial designer as a
trained
technician
who serves the dictates of industry rather than as an
independent artist.
He
alienated many former friends, who thought his stance
reactionary, just as
he was
ting with other members of the Transportation Board over
policy. The
activities of the CAI were curtailed with the outbreak of
war in 1939, and
Pick,
disillusioned and deeply depressed, resigned from the
Transportation Board
in
1940. He died in 1941, shortly after giving a talk entitled
"Re-Energizing
Religion."
<sup><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
From first to last, Pick's abiding concern had
been to
create a spiritual community.

<p>
The redefinition of industrial design that Pick had helped
to establish in
the
late 1930s was continued by others during and immediately
following the
war. In
the early years of the war the Board of Trade realized that
Americans had
established a 

<B></B>

 technologically
sophisticated industrial design profession
in the
mid-1920s, and that America would be Britain's prime
economic competitor
following the war. The government's committees on industrial
design
reported that
the arts and crafts' ideal of the artist as designer would
have to be
abandoned
in the postwar world. The Weir Committee of 1943, for
example, stated "in
our
view there has been too much emphasis on the words 'art' and
'artists'."
<sup><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
As a result of such criticism, the government
established the Council of Industrial Design in 1944. Its
chairman stated
that
"the industrial designer is not expressing an intensely
personal point of
view
like the artist. He is one of a team. He is concerned with
the problems of
producing in quantities goods for use, not individual works
of
art."
<sup><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
Robin Darwin, a member of the council, became
Principal of
the Royal College of Art in 1949, and turned it away from
its interwar
emphasis
on the union of the arts toward a more technologically
oriented training
for the
demands of the new light-metal industries. Born in 1910,
Darwin was no
medieval
modernist. He wrote in 1950, "William Morris's ideas were
all confused
with the
'dignity of labour' and so on . . . I think this whole
attitude is muddle
and
bunk."
<sup><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>

<p>
The separation of fine art and industrial design was further
cemented by
the
creation of the Arts Council in 1945, an outgrowth of the
Council for the
Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), established
during the war.
CEMA had
promoted the union of the arts in its exhibitions. When
members of CEMA
began to
draft the Arts Council's charter, they found they could be
exempted from
taxation
under a nineteenth-century act that applied to those
societies that dealt
with
"the Fine Arts exclusively."
<sup><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
The secretary of CEMA, Mary
Glasgow,
worked with the Department of Treasury in arriving at a
definition of
"Fine Art"
that included industrial art, because, as she put it, "it
might often be
difficult to draw a line between fine and applied art, a pot
and a
picture."
<sup><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>
But treasury officials and the chairman of CEMA,
John
Maynard Keynes, worked out a definition of "Fine Art" that
excluded
industrial
art. Keynes, like his Bloomsbury friend Fry, did not believe
that art
could have
a utilitarian function. In a 1945 letter to the secretary of
CEMA he wrote,
"Indeed, it is only to a modern ear that any doubt could
possibly arise.
In the
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries . . . the distinction
between the
Fine Arts
and the Applied Arts was familiar. In short, the expression
'Fine Arts' is
by way
of distinction from the technical arts."
<sup><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>

<p>
With the foundings of the Council of Industrial Design for
the supervision
of
utilitarian "industrial design" and the Arts Council for the
supervision of
transcendental "fine art," design and art were cleft once
again: the
former to be
used, the latter to be contemplated. This distinction,
although challenged
within
recent years by the pluralist and antihierarchical thrust of
postmodern
theories,
nevertheless remains a common view today. Indeed, a
controversy erupted
over the
definition of art in January 1989, when the Royal Academy
mounted an
exhibition
of the work of Malcolm McClaren, who designed the image of
the Sex Pistols.
McClaren's work, according to one critic, did not qualify as
"art," but
rather as
"design"--and therefore ought not to be displayed at the RA:
"I would
class Mr.
McClaren as a designer, who creates style, 

<B></B>

 rather than as an artist." But
Frederick Gore, age seventy-five, disagreed: "I am
personally dead against
any
distinction between fine art and all the activities which
are its
fundamental
background and basis. Directly you divorce art from life and
think of art
as a
separate commodity you have met disaster."
<sup><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>
Gore reached
adulthood
in the 1930s, and in 1989 he continued to speak medieval
modernese.

<p>
The example of Pick and the Underground shows that the
culminating
achievement of
the arts and crafts movement was not the floral scarves sold
at Liberty's,
but
the London Underground. The story of Pick and the
Underground also reveals
that
visual modernism was commonly understood in terms of the
romantic
medievalism of
Ruskin and Morris. Modernism has been defined in numerous
ways, but often
as
rejecting the past, as seeking to "Make It New." But as we
have seen, the
English
avant-garde tended to be retro-garde. Contemporaries
certainly recognized
this:
in 1933 J. E. Barton told listeners of his six-part series
on modern art
broadcast by the BBC, "Our modern architects, sculptors,
painters and
designers
generally, are often described as'breaking away from
tradition.' It would
be far
more accurate to say that they are trying to get back to
tradition."
<sup><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>
Similar ideas can be found among modernists on
the
Continent. Walter Gropius, for example, intended the Bauhaus
to emulate the
medieval workshop traditions in which architecture was seen
as the master
art
uniting all others ("Bauhaus" is derived from
<I>Bauh&uuml;tten, </I>the
medieval
craft lodges for artisans working on the cathedrals).
<sup><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>
But the
attempt to associate modernism with the past may have been
most pronounced
in
England, where the more things change the more they are made
to appear to
remain
the same.

<p>
Finally, what does the example of Pick and his medieval
modern cohorts
contribute
to contemporary debates about the relationship between
modernism and the
avant-garde? The question arises because of the seeming
similarities
between this
story and B&uuml;rger's "historically concrete"
<sup><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>
<I>Theory of
the
Avant-Garde. </I>In his influential analysis, B&uuml;rger
distinguishes the
"historical avant-garde" from modernism, which he sees as
the culminating
stage
of art's progressive development toward autonomy, a
development he links
with the
increasing influence of the "bourgeoisie." For B&uuml;rger,
late
nineteenth-century aestheticism, in which a work's content
as well as its
form no
longer referred to the praxis of life, was the necessary
outcome of a
series of
events that had rendered art increasingly autotelic. By the
early twentieth
century, the congruence of the bourgeois definition of art
as autonomous
with
art's formal break with mimesis meant that the bourgeois had
succeeded in
institutionalizing art as autonomous and universal, their
emphasis on the
sensuous aspects of art over the practical a reflection of
their own
relative
"free[dom] from the pressures of the need for survival"
(<I>TAG,</I> 46).
The
"historical avant-garde," such as the Dadaists or
Surrealists, arose to
critique
the bourgeois institution of art, their dissonant works
designed to expose
it as
contingent and class-based. The avant-garde also sought to
reintegrate art
and
life in order "to organize a new life praxis from a basis in
art."
(<I>TAG,</I>
49) But although the historical avant-garde succeeded in
unmasking the
institutionalized character of art in bourgeois society,
they were
unsuccessful
in destroying the institution of art--instead, their
"anti-art" activities
were
themselves absorbed 

<B></B>

 by this
institution and constituted as art. In several
important respects, B&uuml;rger's formulation of the rise
and fall of the
historical avant-garde appears to match the English medieval
modernists'
own rise
and fall: from their critiques of aesthetic formalism to the
failure of
their
more utopian dreams and the return of a formalist definition
of "fine art"
by
1945.

<p>
On closer inspection, however, B&uuml;rger's theory of an
historical
avant-garde
is rather ahistorical, relying more on suppositions about
art and culture
derived
from Hegel, Marx, and the Frankfurt School than on detailed
historical
investigation, and ultimately obscures more than it
illuminates. What, for
example, are we to make of his teleological conception of
art within
bourgeois
society as a gradual "unfolding" (<I>TAG,</I> 17) toward
complete autonomy,
blooming finally as aestheticism and the "institution of
art"? First, as
B&uuml;rger at times concedes, there was no unilateral trend
toward
autonomy in
the nineteenth century: George Leonard, for example, has
traced an
important
lineage of artists, extending from the early romantics such
as Wordsworth
through
John Cage, that regarded art and everyday life as
inseparable.
<sup><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>
Furthermore, aestheticism itself was hardly the middle-class
ideal of art,
at
least if we accept the accounts of contemporaries at the
turn of the
century. And
the relationship between aestheticism and autonomy is more
vexed than
B&uuml;rger
allows: some aesthetes who seemed to deny art's social
function, such as
Walter
Pater or Oscar Wilde, actually held more complex positions
that allowed
for art's
association with the praxis of everyday life;
<sup><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>
others, such as
Mallarm&eacute; and Yeats, associated their aesthetic
endeavors with a
sacred and
occult realm that had direct consequences for conduct in the
profane world.

<p>
The dubious utility of B&uuml;rger's notion of a bourgeois
"institution of
art,"
codifying and promoting aesthetic autonomy, becomes even
more pronounced
when we
examine the provenance of those who advocated aesthetic
"formalism" and
those who
insisted on a more socially engaged art. Not only did both
tend to be from
the
middle classes; we often find both positions being advocated
at different
times
by the same person. Fry, for example, was a prominent
advocate of art's
autonomy,
yet he remained ambivalent about the Quaker tradition of
service in which
he was
raised, and the arts and crafts tradition to which he
formerly belonged.
He had
been a member of the arts and crafts' society the Art
Workers' Guild (he
resigned
in 1910), and in 1913 he formed his own crafts workshop,
modelled after the
<I>botegas </I>of the Italian Renaissance, the Omega
Workshops Limited. He
tried
to present the Omega as an "autonomous" workshop that
created aesthetic
artifacts
that just happened to be useful; "purposive without purpose"
would have
served as
an ideal motto. Fry claimed that the Omega was formed
primarily to give
modern
artists part-time employment, and that the functionality of
the craft
objects was
secondary to more formalist concerns: "The Omega Workshops
Limited is a
group of
artists who are working with the object of allowing free
play to the
delight in
creation in the making of objects for common life."
<sup><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></sup>
This
attitude
might explain why many Omega products soon fell apart.

<p>
Nevertheless, Fry was also concerned with the social
function of modern
art,
despite his claims to the contrary; he wanted to increase
the public's
appreciation of 

<B></B>

 art and to beautify
their surroundings. Writing his mother
about
the formation of Omega, he stated that "my problem is now to
harness [art]
to
practical purposes. There's no doubt that it is a difficult
thing to do and
perhaps that is why almost all manufacturers give it up and
go to the
patient
hack instead of the artist for their designs."
<sup><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></sup>
Even after
dissolving the Omega in 1920 for financial reasons, Fry
continued to be
ambivalent about the aesthetic formalism he and Bell had
championed. In
1926 he
welcomed Pick's use of modern artists, and noted "perhaps we
could save
ourselves
a good deal of painful and unnecessary emotion if we were
less exacting in
our
ideals, if we recognized that the real and pressing needs of
society are
not even
in what are called works of art concerned with the higher
spiritual
adventures."
<sup><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></sup>
Other examples of artists who shifted between an
"autonomous" and an "engaged" conception of art during this
period can be
cited.
Rather than distinguishing an autonomous modernism from an
engaged
avant-garde,
modernism should be viewed as containing both tendencies,
just as it
encompasses
other binaries such as primitivism/futurism,
subjectivity/objectivity,
classicism/romanticism, and nationalism/ cosmopolitanism.

<p>
Finally, if we are to accept the "avant-garde" as a
legitimate term for one
strand of modernism, we must still examine the extent to
which it is, or
ought to
be, an "oppositional" practice. B&uuml;rger presents the
avant-garde as
inherently oppositional, creating provocative, dissonant
works in order to
shock
its audience into reflecting critically about art's status
and purpose
(<I>TAG,</I> 56). Indeed, he is uneasy about the avant-garde
project, as
he fears
that an art integrated with life "will lose the capacity to
criticize it,
along
with its distance." (<I>TAG,</I> 50) Like the Frankfurt
School theorists
Max
Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, B&uuml;rger suggests that a
genuinely
critical art
must retain a certain distance from everyday life, or else
be co-opted by a
monolithic "culture industry" (<I>TAG,</I> 50,54). But
there have been
many
compelling critiques of the Culture Industry thesis, that
have questioned
the
imputed existence and aims of such an "Industry" as well as
the
accompanying
assumption that it retails unambiguous cultural messages
that will be
passively
received and accepted by its audience.
<sup><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></sup>

<p>
It is clear that B&uuml;rger's "historically concrete"
theory of the
radically
oppositional character of the avant-garde, and his pessimism
regarding the
tenability of their aims, are both predicated on normative
assumptions
rather
than historical investigations. The extent of avant-garde
opposition to
contemporary social practices will vary, not only according
to individual
res, particular movements, and historical circumstances,
but also
according
to national traditions. In England the association of the
visual arts with
everyday life and practical purposes extends back through
the nineteenth
century,
reflecting the country's utilitarian biases, Protestant
heritage, and the
relatively close association between intellectuals and the
traditional
ruling
elite.
<sup><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></sup>
Thus throughout the nineteenth century the government
justified public expenditures on museums and art education
on grounds of
utility:
art would be the handmaiden of industry.
<sup><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></sup>
Art critics like
Ruskin,
on the other hand, attempted to legitimate the visual arts
on moral and
spiritual
grounds, in an attempt to overcome 

<B></B>

 the
nation's entrenched heritage of
iconoclasm. Finally, the state's minimal patronage of the
arts through
World War
II gave wide scope to local governments and individual
patrons to promote
the
arts, and many of these patrons--like Frank Pick--envisaged
themselves as
working
within widely shared cultural norms and traditions, even if
their immediate
appraisals of the meaning of modern art differed.

<p>
If we define the historical avant-garde as encompassing
those who
attempted to
integrate modern art and life, we must concede that the
English
avant-garde of
the interwar period tended to be no less Establishment than
oppositional.
This
Establishment aspect helps explain its effectiveness in
introducing modern
visual
art to the public: as we have seen, the English avant-garde
did not only
consist
of artists, but also of government officials, businessmen,
educators, and
members
of the media. They may not have instituted an Earthly
Paradise, but
through the
fervor of reformers reared on Ruskin and Morris the visual
arts attained a
prominent place in English culture. For centuries the
English had
congratulated
themselves on being preeminently a literary culture, openly
ceding pride
of place
in the visual arts to the Continent. Carlyle's "The Hero as
Man of Letters"
expresses this wider cultural bias; Matthew Arnold's
definition of culture
as
"the best which has been thought and said in this world"
pointedly left
out the
best that has been seen and arranged. Medieval modernists
helped restore
visual
art to a prominence that it may not have had in England
since the
Reformation.

<p>
The example of English medieval modernism demonstrates that
the historical
avant-garde cannot be defined in opposition to "modernism,"
and that it
need not
be understood as inherently opposed to capitalism,
commodification, or the
dominant culture. Indeed, the paradigmatic avant-garde work
of the early
twentieth century was not the <I>Fountain </I>of Marcel
Duchamp, but the
London
Underground of Frank Pick.

I admire and concur with D. L. LeMahieu's discussion of
interwar English
culture, but I disagree with his contention regarding the
English
avant-garde:
"Whatever their political affiliations, Left or Right, the
avant-garde in
England
retained the moral distance, social detachment, and
aesthetic superiority
characteristic of traditional elite culture." (D. L.
LeMahieu, <I>A
Culture for
Democracy: Mass Communication and the Cultivated Mind in
Britain Between
the Wars
</I>[New York: Oxford University Press, 1988], 207) This
does hold true for
certain artists and critics at some points in their
careers--Herbert Read,
for
example, switched repeatedly from seeing art as detached and
"formalist" to
seeing it as a well-made artifact fit for its purpose in
common life. On
the
whole, however, visual modernism in England during the
interwar period
tended to
be interpreted within a utilitarian and moral framework.

While Fry and Bell differed in aspects of their aesthetic
formulations,
they
both agreed that art was autonomous. Fry denied that art had
any
connection with
morality, and Bell's definition of "significant form"
exemplifies the
formalist
conception of art as autonomous:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The representative element in a work of art may or may not
be harmful;
always it
is irrelevant. For, to appreciate a work of art we need
bring with us
nothing
from life, no knowledge of its ideas and affairs, no
familiarity with its
emotions. Art transports us from the world of man's activity
to a world of
aesthetic exaltation. [Clive Bell, <I>Art </I>(1914;

It is true that Morris's simple, geometrical designs did
influence
modern
design and architecture, but generally Ruskin and Morris's
Victorian social
aesthetic is seen as eclipsed by modernism's formalist
aesthetic.
Borzello, for
example, argues that while William Morris influenced many
fields, "of all
the
fields he influenced, fine art remained untouched" (Frances
Borzello,
<I>Civilizing Caliban </I>[London: Routledge &amp; Kegan
Paul, 1987], 7).
Similarly, Fishman argues that Ruskin had little influence
on art criticism
during the interwar period. See Solomon Fishman, <I>The
Interpretation of
Art
</I>(Berkeley: California University Press, 1963), 15. The
connection
between the
arts and crafts movement and modern industrial design and
architecture has
been
traced by Nikolaus Pevsner in his <I>Pioneers of Modern
Design </I>(London:
Penguin Books, 1975). Romantic medievalism has had a
significant impact on
modern
literature as well as modern art in this period, notably in
the works of
Eliot,
Pound, and Joyce. Joyce's nostalgia for the Middle Ages and
use of
scholastic
aesthetics has been explored by Umberto Eco, <I>The
Aesthetics of
Chaosmos: The
Middle Ages of James Joyce, </I>trans. Ellen Esrock
(Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard
University Press, 1989). The strong continuities between
romantic and
modernist
American poetry (including the works of Eliot and Pound)
have been noted by
Albert Gelpi: "Modernists, for all their loud inveighing
against
Romanticism,
longed for and adopted positions that are unmistakably,
though sometimes
covertly, Romantic." (Albert Gelpi, <I>A Coherent Splendor
</I>[Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1987], 5) Charles Harrison, in
<I>English Art
and
Modernism 1900-1939 </I>(London: Allan Tate, 1981) and S. K.
Tillyard have
both
discussed the influence of the arts and crafts movement on
Fry. Harrison
notes
some of the affinities between Fry's ideas and those of
Ruskin and Morris,
but
argues that Fry and Bell's "aesthetic" conception of art
separated them
from
Ruskin and Morris's sociological conception. Tillyard argues
that the
"discourse"
of the arts and crafts movement shaped Fry's initial
explanation of
post-impressionism, as well as the public's reception of the
1910
exhibition
"Manet and the Post-Impressionists." She then contends that
Fry and Bell
developed a more specific "language" and "aesthetic" for
postimpressionism
between 1910 and 1914 that no longer referred to the arts
and crafts
aesthetic,
and that this new formalist discourse went unchallenged
following the
First World
War. (S. K. Tillyard, <I>The Impact of Modernism, 1900-1920
</I>[London:
Routledge, 1988], 199-216, 248-50) Thus, while arguing for
continuities
through
1910, she also sees the years 1910-12 as marking a decisive
break with the
past
that was firmly established by 1918. I believe that this
strictly formalist
aesthetic was strongly challenged throughout the interwar
period, and that
the
reception and assimilation of modern art through the late
1930s owed as
much to
the romantic medievalism of Pugin, Ruskin, and Morris as it
did to the
formalism
of Fry and Bell.

A remarkable number of the most influential patrons and
proselytizers
of
modern art came from Yorkshire, which was also notable for
being the
birthplace
of several of England's finest modern artists, with Henry
Moore, Barbara
Hepworth, and Edward Wadsworth among them. These patrons
from Yorkshire
included
Frank Pick, William Rothenstein, Herbert Read, Michael
Sadler, Charles
Holme,
Raymond Unwin, Charles Rutherston, Percy Jowett, A. R.
Orage, Holbrook
Jackson,
the art publishing firm of Lund Humphries, and the
publisher/gallery firm
Zwemmers. Prior to the World War I, Leeds was arguably the
modern art
capital of
England. The Leeds Arts Club (founded by Orage and Jackson),
Leeds
University
(under the vice-chancellorship of Sadler), and the Leeds Art
Museum
(during the
curatorship of Frank Rutter, later the art critic for the
<I>Sunday
Times</I>)
were influential in bringing modern art and modern artists
to the North of
England, where impressionable students like Read and Moore
were exposed to
the
new artistic currents.

Board of Education memo regarding a conversation with Pick,
10 January
1936,
PRO, ED 136/9. During World War II the government realized
that they were
far
behind many other nations in industrial design for
light-metal industry
products,
and struggled to find ways to catch up. E. M. Dickey of the
Board of
Education
admitted in 1943 that design for products of
"non-traditional" industries
had not
been seriously considered for most of the 1930s:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The design for appearance of engineering products from
machine tools and
locomotives to typewriters and sewing machines was not
specifically dealt
with in
Frank Pick's "Design and the Designer". We thought this was
partly because
the
topic was hardly in the air at the time the Arts &amp;
Industry Council
issued
that report and partly because Mr. Pick's own scheme for
good design in
everything to do with London Transport was so satisfactory
that he did not
need
to take the then newly streamlined USA locomotives etc. very
seriously.

to Miss Goodfellow, 18 November 1943, PRO, ED 46/154]

Nikolaus Pevsner and Christian Barman, who knew and worked
with Pick,
wrote
appreciative reminiscences in which they acknowledged Pick's
moral and
spiritual
aims. See Nikolaus Pevsner, "Frank Pick," in <I>Studies in
Art,
Architecture, and
Design, </I>vol. 2 (New York: Walker and Company, 1968) and
Christian
Barman,
<I>The Man Who Built London Transport: A Biography of Frank
Pick </I>(North
Pomfret, Vt.: David &amp; Charles, 1979). Possibly in
reaction to these
works,
Adrian Forty has argued that Pick's foremost concern was
with enhancing the
corporate image of the Underground for commercial purposes.

In many of his writings Pick defended commerce as a "liberal
art," in
an
attempt to raise its status. As far as he was concerned, the
world of
commerce
was comparable to the world of gentility: "Industry is an
alternative mode
of
association to the public school." (Frank Pick, "Education
and Training in
the
Transportation Service," 1929, file A21, p. 18, London
Transport Museum)
In this
Pick may have drawn inspiration from Ruskin, who had told a
Manchester
audience
that "I believe tradesman may be, ought to be--often are,
more gentlemen
than
idle and useless people." ("A Joy Forever," <I>The Complete

Charles Holden, the architect who worked closely with Pick
in the
interwar
period, recalled how expeditious Pick could be. Holden
presented Pick with
the
plans for the new Underground headquarters: "A telephone
call, a meeting
with him
the same afternoon, a board meeting later the same afternoon
and then a
message
'Right, carry on'. Quick work: but Pick was like that, he
knew there was
always
time to correct a false move." (Charles Holden, "Frank

Holden's Underground Headquarters at St. James' Street has a
cruciform
shape
like that of the medieval cathedrals, although Holden stated
that he gave
the
building this design because he had to accommodate traffic
from two
separate
streets, and thus the design was the most fit for its
purpose. Lawrence
Menear
describes both the Cockfosters Station and the Uxbridge
Station as
resembling
cathedrals; see <I>London's Underground Stations </I>(1983;

Wages and benefits were relatively high, and employees were
rewarded
for
useful suggestions to improve the system. See Frank Pick,
"Progress,"
November
1926, file A15, London Transport Museum; and idem,
"Education and Training
in the
Transport Service," July 1929, file A21, London Transport
Museum. In the
latter,
Pick noted that the use of automated devices within the
system did
eliminate some
jobs of a tedious or menial nature (automated doors on the
Tubes, for
example,
led to the elimination of human door-openers). While
regretting having to
let
some workers go, Pick believed that the use of machines for
unskilled
labor would
ultimately create more challenging jobs, worthy of an
individual's time:
"A man
should be employed as a man to use the whole of his
faculties and
abilities in
his work, and not as a mere unit of power, capable of doing
some
particular piece
of manual labor."

Pick's visions became more grandiose in the 1930s, when the
LPTB was
formed;
he felt he now had the power he needed to make London, in
Lethaby's
phrase, "neat
and tidy." Statements such as the following were common:
"These patterns of
transport constitute the indispensable framework upon which
London must be
built." (Frank Pick, "The Organisation of Transport,"

Royal
Society of the Arts </I>[3 January 1936]: 214)

Wilde's 1884
lecture
"The Value of Art in Modern Life": "I have found that all
ugly things are
made by
those who strive to make something beautiful, and that all
beautiful
things are
made by those who strive to make something useful." (Richard
Ellmann,
<I>Oscar
Wilde </I>[London: Hamish Hamilton, 1987], 246) This was not
simply a
Wildean
paradox; it was a remark often made by followers of the arts
and crafts
tradition. Eric Gill wrote in 1921, "Man's quality is
chiefly exhibited in
his
works and that the physical form of things is not determined
by caprice
but by
their nature and purpose: That if you take care of Truth and
Goodness,
Beauty
will take care of itself." (Eric Gill, <I>Art-Nonsense and

"In the arts an appetite for a new look is now a
professional requirement,
as in
Russia to be accredited as a revolutionist is to qualify for
privileges,"
wrote
Harold Rosenberg, the champion of action painting, in 1960.
Densely packed
with
ironies intended and unintended, Rosenberg's marvelous
sentence
encapsulates the
atmosphere in which many members of the generation now
reaching seniority
in the
arts and the academy were educated. Indeed, it is tempting
now to look
back on
that period as if on some kind of Brezhnevite stagnation, in
which
yesterday's
antitraditionalist sloganeering was appropriated to defend
today's
reactionary
traditionalism, and in which loyalty to the new was
professed in order to
resist
change. The attempt to marry the Permanent Revolution to the
Great
Tradition led
to a vast proliferation of newspeak and doublethink, for as
Rosenberg went
on to
observe, "the new cannot become a tradition without giving
rise to unique
contradictions, myths, absurdities."
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
We are still living with them. The historiography of
art--and
particularly, it
seems, of music--remains the most stubbornly Whiggish of all
historiographies,
despite longstanding maverick opposition.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
That
historiography is
still a Tradition-of-the-New narrative that celebrates
technical
innovation,
viewed as progress within a narrowly circumscribed aesthetic
domain. The
hermetic
and formalist side of this paradigm and the heroically
individualistic,
asocial
side of it remain sources 



 of
dissatisfaction to those of us who believe
that this
manner of accounting for the production and the value of
artworks has had a
deleterious influence on that very production and that very
value.

<p>
 Awareness has been growing that the two sides of the
enduring paradigm are
codependent, that in both aspects the resulting narratives
have been
tendentiously exclusionary, and that the ideology of the
cold war, which
sanctioned the association of logical positivism with
democracy and of
formalism
with the defense of political freedom, has been to a
long-unrecognized
extent
their artificial life-support system. The influence of the
cold war on
modernist
attitudes in Rosenberg's field has been energetically
documented of late,
sometimes with a tinge of conspiracy theorizing.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The single
noteworthy attempt of this kind so far in the field of music
has been an
article
by Martin Brody, "'Music for the Masses': Milton Babbitt's
Cold War Music
Theory," in which Babbitt's scientism is somewhat benignly
explained as a
defense, on the part of a thinker formed (and scarred) by
the "dangerously
irrational" ideological battles of the 1930s, against a
priori (which is
to say
political) constraints on conceptualizing "the nature and
limits of music"
and
against the political exploitability of any "looser," less
intransigently
rationalistic discourse.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Will the end of the cold war spell the end of all these
redemptive
mythologies
and exclusionary strategies? Will we finally get beyond the
poietic
fallacy that
focuses all attention on the making of the artwork, hence on
the person
(and the
putative freedoms) of the maker? Will we see that artists's
shoptalk is not
invariably the best model or medium for criticism? Will we
allow that the
context
of technical innovation in the arts need not be confined to
the history of
art?
Will we accept that what an artist will experience as "an
irresistible pull
within the art"
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
may have sources in the wider world,
including some
of which the artist may not be wholly aware, and that it is
the
historian's or
the critic's job to describe them, however fallibly?

<p>
A major deterrent to enlarging the purview of art
historiography and
criticism
along these lines is the unwholesomeness of what might be
discovered, and
the
intolerable implications such discovery may be seen to
harbor. Formalism
has been
a bulwark against such a threat. Its defenders have tended
to impugn the
motives
of skeptics, who are accused of genius-envy and, more
sweepingly, of
hostility to
the integrity of the individual. As one who has
investigated, and who has
felt it
important to investigate, Stravinsky's alarming political
affinities, and
drawn
fire in consequence, I can well appreciate the qualms
expressed by the
author of
a recent inquiry into the occultist wellsprings of modernist
poetry. "This
study
is not a postmodern critique of modernism," he felt it
necessary to
declare. "It
is not my intention to unveil the errors, self-deceptions,
and vices of
those
geniuses whose impossibly great achievements oppress us
all."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
He
knows that he is in for censure from a "scholarly community
[that]
considers it
poor form to dwell upon such an aberration" as occultism,
and the history
of
Scriabin research shows that the musicological community has
been similarly
disposed.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
Those who wish to see Scriabin promoted from accredited
crank to accredited
genius are precisely the ones least able to cope with what,
in this case,
were
the composer's 

<B></B>

 acknowledged allegiances
and his professed
purposes.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
And that seems to be because it is precisely his
inseparability from
<I>fin de
si&egrave;cle </I>occultism that has made Scriabin's
canonical status in
the West
so obstinately insecure. When it comes to a central,
uncontested and
incontestable genius of modern music like Stravinsky,
resistance to
cultural
contextualization becomes fiercer yet, especially when that
looming context
involves more than what can be dismissed as private folly,
but links up
with
great public evils, like fascism and anti-Semitism, that
have had gruesome
public
consequences.

<p>
Unlike Scriabin's occultism (or Schoenberg's, for that
matter),
Stravinsky's
fascism and his anti-Semitism were not, as a rule, matters
the composer
saw fit
explicitly to thematize in his work. Although he did choose
to set a
couple of
anti-Semitic texts in his American years, the texts do not
seem to have
been
selected for the sake of their anti-Semitism.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Stravinsky
never made
a setting of the <I>Giovinezza </I>or the <I>Horst Wessel
Lied </I>(but he
did
set <I>The Volga Boatmen's Song </I>on commission from the
liberal
post-Tsarist
pre-Bolshevik provisional government of Russia in 1917, and
he set <I>The
Star-Spangled Banner </I>on his own initiative in 1941).

<p>
In the absence of any explicit indication from the composer,
it cannot
suffice
merely to assert that his social circumstances and political
attitudes
ineluctably shaped his musical output. That amounts to no
more than a
truism,
impervious to falsification and therefore empty of
information. As in the
case of
sexuality--say, Tchaikovsky's or Schubert's (to cite issues
of lively
currency)
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
--the burden of proof must rest with those who
assert the
critical relevance of the connection, and such relevance can
only be
established
on specific terms: what circumstances? what attitudes? how
have they
shaped which
works?

<p>
To the extent that the argument is advanced in terms of
generalities (on
the
level, that is, of "theory"), adherents of the formalist or
autonomist
position
will always be able to maintain, on the basis of its
specificity, the
superiority
of context-free "essential" knowledge;
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
nor will they be in
any way
shaken in their belief that such knowledge, being purely
"aesthetic,"
engages the
art-work without mediation and, hence, obviates any need for
interpretation.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Yet even when successfully demonstrated, the
connection between music and historical situation or between
music and the
wider
world of ideas is not self-evidently enhancing or
illuminating. Asserted
dogmatically, it can amount to a debased form of the
intentional
fallacy--debased
in the sense that it is not even the composer but a mere
surrogate, the
researcher, who now claims the privileged authority of the
creator. Just as
undesirably, it can reduce works to the status of
exemplification. Works
can and
certainly do survive their immediate contexts, and it is the
hermeneutic
position
itself that would uphold their right to change (that is, to
be
reconstituted)
accordingly. Again, cases must be judged on their merits,
with due
reckoning of
gains and losses.

<p>
It is when works "survive" into the twilight zone of
decontextualization--or
recontextualization within the formalist canon--that losses
can seem most
decisively to outweigh gains. Often, and paradoxically, it
is the very
radicalism
of modernist art 

<B></B>

 that is supposed to
vouchsafe its transcendence of
historical
contingency. Reacting to my own historical investigations
concerning
Stravinsky's
patrimony and evolution (and, as often happens, attributing
to me stronger
claims
than I would care to make), Pieter van den Toorn has
declared himself to
be "not
all that certain that this early Russian heritage is
invariably the most
useful
context within which to angle the terms of Stravinsky's
musical
particularity,"
because "what may astonish most about this music is not the
ties that bind
it to
its immediate past but the distance that separates it from
that
past."
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Certainly; and yet neither the ties that bind nor the
distance that separates can be realistically gauged without
specific
knowledge of
what Van den Toorn and many others would evidently prefer to
forget.

<p>
Among those who have most loudly chanted the praises of
amnesia was
Stravinsky,
whose squeamishness about his past, and whose rewritings of
it, have become
legend.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
By the latest (Cold War) phase of his career, the
amnesia,
formerly applied selectively and opportunistically, had
become a
generalized
defense against all "extramusical" association. The
following exchange
from the
first book of "conversations" with Robert Craft is
indicative:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
<I>R.C.</I> Have you ever thought that music is, as Auden
says, "a virtual
image
of our experience of living as temporal, with its double
aspect of
recurrence and
becoming?"
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I.S. If music is to me an "image of our experience of living
as temporal,"
(and
however unverifiable, I suppose it is), my saying so is the
result of a
reflection and as such is independent of music itself. But
this kind of
thinking
about music is a different vocation altogether for me: I
cannot do
anything with
it as a truth, and my mind is a doing one . . . . Auden's
"image of our
experience of living as temporal" (which is also an image)
is above music,
perhaps, but it does not obstruct or contradict the purely
musical
experience.
What shocks me however, is the discovery that many people
think below
music.
Music is merely something that reminds them of something
else--of
landscapes, for
example; my Apollo is always reminding someone of Greece.
But in even the
most
specific attempts at evocation, what is meant by being
"like" and what are
"correspondences?" Who, listening to Liszt's precise and
perfect little
Nuages
gris, could pretend that "gray clouds" are a musical cause
and effect?
(CIS, 15)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The first thing to note, in attempting to unpack this
remarkable little
document,
is that the phrase of Auden's from which the composer is at
such pains to
distance himself is in fact a paraphrase--a knowing
paraphrase, one has to
think--of some famous pronouncements by Stravinsky himself.
In his Parisian
autobiography of 1936, <I>Chroniques de ma Vie,
</I>Stravinsky followed his
famous ting words about music's powerlessness "to
<I>express
</I>anything at
all" with an honorable attempt to define not only what music
was not, but
also
what it was. "Music," he then wrote (or had his ghostwriter
write),

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
is the sole domain in which man realizes the present. By the
imperfection
of his
nature, man is doomed to submit to the passage of time--to
its categories
of past
and future--without ever being able to give substance, and
therefore
stability,
to the category of the 

<B></B>

 present. The
phenomenon of music is given to us
with the
sole purpose of establishing an order in things, including,
and
particularly, the
coordination between <I>man</I> and<I> time.</I>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
A dozen years
later, at lunch at the Raleigh Hotel in Washington, D.C. on
31 March 1948,
Stravinsky surprised Robert Craft, whom he had just met and
who recorded
it in
his diary, with the "marvelous remark" that "music is the
best means we
have of
digesting time." The Stravinskys's other luncheon guest that
day was W. H.
Auden.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
For the interwar and the postwar Stravinskys, then, the
Stravinskys whose third-hand Bergsonian remarks Auden
admired and improved
upon,
music, even if it did not "express," nevertheless signified,
and what it
signified was of the most primal human significance.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
The
cold-war
Stravinsky was more exigent; he insisted, not on music as
metaphor, but on
"music
itself" (<I>CIS,</I> 15).

<p>
That is a very strange notion indeed, "music itself." Its
history has yet
to be
written, but it does not seem to be a very long one. In the
sense in which
the
cold-war Stravinsky used the term, it does not seem to
extend back more
than a
decade or two before Stravinsky used it. The term has
nothing to do with
the
nineteenth century's "absolute music," with which it is now
often
mistakenly
interchanged; for the absoluteness of absolute music, as
Wagner (yes,
Wagner)
first envisioned it, was an absolute expressivity, not an
absolute freedom
of
expression.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Stravinsky's first approximation to the term
comes in a
little talk he took around beginning in 1935 to introduce
the concerts at
which
he and his son Sviatoslav (Soulima) gave the initial
performances of the
<I>Concerto per due pianoforti soli. </I>"There are
different ways of
loving and
appreciating music," he would say:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
There is, for instance, the way that I would call
self-interested love,
wherein
one demands from music emotions of a general sort--joy,
sorrow, sadness, a
subject for dreaming on, forgetfulness of ordinary
existence. But that
devalues
music by assigning it a utilitarian end. Why not love it for
its own sake?
Why
not love it as one loves a picture, for the sake of the
beautiful
painting, the
beautiful design, the beautiful composition? Why not admit
that music has
an
intrinsic value, independent of the sentiments or images
that it may evoke
by
analogy, and that can only corrupt the hearer's judgment?
Music needs no
help. It
is sufficient unto itself. Don't look for anything else in
it beyond what
it
already contains.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
These are clearly related concepts. Yet to speak of "aimer
la musique pour
elle-m&ecirc;me," or to say that "elle suffit &agrave;
elle-m&ecirc;me,"
is not
at all the same as speaking of "la musique elle-m&ecirc;me,"
something of
which
Stravinsky does not yet seem to have the notion. He is still
speaking
(Kantianly,
one might say) of pure motives and pure attitudes--of
"aestheticism," if
you
like--but not, as yet, of pure essences. (He could hardly
have been doing
that
before concerts in which his <I>Three Tableaux from
Petrushka, </I>played
by
Soulima, shared the program with the new<I> Concerto.</I>)

<p>
The special congeries of notions expressed by tautological
terms like
"music
itself," "the music itself," "music as music," and so on,
came later, at
least to 

<B></B>

Stravinsky. And they came to him in America. They coincide
with his serial
period. (Indeed, he makes a point, in a passage elided from
the Auden
discussion
quoted earlier, of exempting the sort of music he was then
composing from
Auden's
metaphors, even insofar as he accepted them: "if I
understand 'recurrence'
and
'becoming,'" he now stipulated, "their aspect is greatly
diminished in
serial
music" [<I>CIS,</I> 15].)

<p>
So what was this new notion of "music itself," of which the
music of the
cold-war
period was the best and purest exemplar? Commonplace though
the phrase has
become
in everyday parlance, intuitively though we may feel we
understand it, its
definition is intractably elusive--or perhaps it would be
more accurate to
say
protean; for it is never defined except by its context, and
its context is
invariably one of negation. In Stravinsky's response to
Craft, "music
itself" is
defined as being <I>not </I>"the result of a reflection;" it
is <I>not
</I>evocative; it is <I>not </I>a correspondence; it is
"below" the terms
of
Auden's generalization (so it's not that), and "above" such
particular
things as
landscapes and clouds (so it's none of those, either). But
what is it?

<p>
Impossible to say--which is precisely why the term has
become
indispensable in
certain kinds of metamusical discourse. It is the great
instrument of
rejection.
In Joseph Kerman's <I>Contemplating Music, </I>for example,
a book that
had as
its objective precisely the redefinition of musicology's
domain and its
methodology so as to put it in closer touch with "the music
itself," the
concept
is wielded like a bazooka. "Music itself," or "music as
music," or, less
often,
"music in its own terms," we learn, does not consist in
facts about music;
or in
autonomous systems or structure; or in historical
generalizations; or in
texts
("the bare score"); or in "moments in a hypothesized
evolutionary
process"; or in
"art 'objects' susceptible to objective manipulation"; or in
bibliographical
minutiae; or in analytical minutiae; or in music-in-culture
or
music-in-society;
or indeed in any exclusive context.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
What's left? Kerman has excluded the general and the
particular, the
autonomous
and the contextual, the whole and the part. And still, his
negatives do
not equal
Stravinsky's negatives, nor do they suggest similar positive
intuitions,
except
insofar as both writers seem to eliminate the reflective and
associate
"music"
(Kerman tacitly, Stravinsky openly) with some kind of
primary,
inarticulate,
implicitly incommunicable activity. In Kerman's case the
residuum is
performing
and listening; these are the activities to which his
envisaged musicology
(or
"criticism") are accessory. In Stravinsky's case the
privileged activity,
naturally enough, is composing (for him, plain
<I>doing</I>). For both of
them,
ultimately, "music itself" is a chimera, for it is half of a
binarism--one
hand
clapping--of which the other half is an "extramusical." As
in any binarism,
neither term can mean anything in the absence of the other.
Each,
therefore, is
fashioned out of its relationship to the other. (The music
itself is that
which
is not extramusical; the extramusical is that which is not
the music
itself.) And
as always, the need for such constructions lies in the
actions--and the
exclusions--that they enable.

<p>
So perhaps it might be better to say that rather than being
merely
chimerical,
the indefinable but indispensable notion of "music itself"
acts as a
<I>cordon
sanitaire, </I>a 

<B></B>

 quarantine staking out
a decontaminated space within
which music
can be composed, performed and listened to in a cultural and
historical
vacuum,
that is, in perfect sterility.

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_a-head-->
II
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The question remains as to why the quarantine is deemed
necessary. Rather
than go
on theorizing about it, let us observe it in action.
Stravinsky's early
masterpiece <I>The Rite of Spring </I>is the perfect test
case: because its
reputation has achieved genuinely mythic proportions;
because the
mythology of
<I>The Rite </I>has generated a huge and many-sided
literature; and
because so
much of that literature is so easily and instructively
falsified.

<p>
The myth is an eclectic compound of at times contradictory
elements. There
was
the work's sensationally nasty Paris premiere. ("The real
thing--a big
'Paris'
scandal!" critics marvelled or scoffed. "Things got as far
as ting,"
the
composer laconically reported in a letter home.)
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
There were
the
many cheap imitations it inspired. (Robert Craft called
<I>The Rite
</I>"the
prize bull that inseminated the whole modern movement.")
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
There was
the durable enigma of its technical premises, inspiring a
clamor of
irreconcilable analytical hypotheses. The myth of <I>The
Rite </I>is at
once a
myth of iconoclasm and a myth of virgin birth; a myth of
disruption and a
myth of
advancement; a myth of artistic synergy and a myth of
musical autonomy.
Several
books have been devoted to the work by now;
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
but to
appreciate the
myth as such it would be better to look, at the outset, not
at the
specialized
literature or the cutting edge of research, but at the
textbooks that
transmit
and cement the conventional wisdom about <I>The Rite </I>and
about
modernist
music in general.

<p>
Stravinsky's score is always a prime exhibit, and usually
<I>the </I>prime
exhibit, in the early chapters of textbooks on
twentieth-century music.
Two such
textbooks, both straightforwardly entitled
<I>Twentieth-Century Music,
</I>have
been published in the last two years, and can be fairly said
to represent
the
current academic-critical consensus. The one by Elliott
Antokoletz opens
with a
boldly formulated assertion of long-established truths:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
An unprecedented departure from established musical
traditions
characterizes much
of the music composed during the first decade of the
twentieth century . .
. . No
changes of musical style or technique have ever produced
such a sense of
historical discontinuity as those that gave rise to our own
era. This
condition
may be traced directly to the radical change in the basic
premises of the
musical
language itself, a revolutionary transformation stemming
most prominently
from
the works of Ives, Scriabin, Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky,
and members of
the
Vienna Schoenberg circle.
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
This is a venerable saga, handed down from bard to bard for
many a year,
but by
now we all know it isn't true. The music of the first
decades of the
present
century, encompassing the outputs of all the res named
in the
concluding
honor roll, is far 

<B></B>

 more appropriately
viewed as a maximalizing phase
within the
traditions established over the course of the preceding
century than as a
departure from them. (To add to the topsy-turviness of the
standard
account, when
the real breaks came, in the 1920s, it was necessary to
disguise them,
then and
since, as a recovery of historical continuity.)
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Thanks to the
recent work of many scholars, in what amounts to a
burgeoning
historiographical
and analytical revolution, this is now very easy to see.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
It
takes
far more intellectual effort, in fact, to go on maintaining
the existence
of (or
perhaps more to the point, simply to go on maintaining) the
wall between
the
modernist Mighty Handful and their antecedents. Yet, as
contemporary
scholarly
performance still attests, many think the effort worthwhile.
Partly, no
doubt, it
is to keep up the status of the modernist giants as giants.
Praising famous
men--or rather, praising self-made men--will remain on the
agenda until
those
perpetually rising middle classes quit rising. It won't be
anytime soon
(and I've
done my share and can't promise I'll stop).

<p>
But there is something else at work here, too. The myth of
the
revolutionary
transformation acts as another sort of <I>cordon
sanitaire</I> around the
thing
transformed--that is, as Antokoletz so resonantly puts it,
"the musical
language
itself." If rupture with the historical past is accepted as
a given--if,
for
example (as Van den Toorn insists in his subtitle), the
<I>Rite of Spring
</I>is
assumed to represent "the <I>beginning </I>of a musical
language" rather
than an
extension or a maximalization or a culmination--then study
of "the basic
premises" of modern music can proceed on an entirely
inferential basis,
and an
entirely sequestered one. The "autonomy" of the analytical
act is
protected. The
advantage of such an approach--the gain, as it
were--consists precisely in
what
is lost from it.

<p>
Stravinsky knew this first and best. As early as the 1920s
(the time, as I
say,
of the real "breaks"), Stravinsky was busily revising the
history of
<I>The Rite
</I>and erasing its past. It was in 1920 that he first told
an interviewer
that
the first inspiration for the ballet had been not a vision
of its final
dance (as
he had previously stated) but a musical theme, and that
consequently he had
written "une oeuvre architectonique et non anecdotique" (an
architectonic
and not
an anecdotal work).
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Over the next fifty years he continually
reinforced the notion that <I>The Rite of Spring, </I>of all
things, was a
"purely musical" work. Perhaps influenced to some degree by
the triumph he
experienced in 1914 ("such as <I>composers </I>rarely
enjoy," he recalled
in old
age), when Pierre Monteux conducted the score in the Salle
Pleyel to a
reception
as tumultuous as the first had been, but now
enthusiastically positive, he
averred categorically that "I prefer <I>Le Sacre </I>as a
concert
piece."
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Many have followed him in this preference. And even if
matters of
preference are
laid aside, it is undeniable that, as Van den Toorn points
out at the very
beginning of his study of the ballet, "for the greater part
of this
century our
knowledge and appreciation of <I>The Rite of Spring </I>have
come from the
concert hall and recordings" (<I>STRS, </I>1). For many, if
not for most
spectators, visual exposure to the work comes after years of
tremendous
stagings
before the mind's eye under the stimulus of the powerful
music, and is
often
disappointing. Van den Toorn goes on to aver, with
Stravinsky, 

<B></B>

 that these
facts
of life and history justify the relegation of all
impedimenta--"the
scenario
itself, the choreography, and, above all, the close
'interdisciplinary'
conditions of coordination under which the music is now
known to have been
composed"--to the limbic category of "the 'extra-musical.'"
"Like pieces
of a
scaffolding," he ingeniously observes, "they were abandoned
in favor of the
edifice itself" (<I>STRS,</I> 2).

<p>
And yet we note a familiar diction, betokening a familiar
discourse, in the
elemental opposition of the "extramusical" scaffold to "the
edifice
<I>itself,"
</I>and wonder how access to the latter is to be gained. The
answer, it
turns
out, is not surprising. We reach the edifice itself by
rigorously
excluding all
that does not conduce directly to "pure musical delight"
(<I>STRS,</I> 7).
And
what is that? Van den Toorn quotes the cold-war Stravinsky:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[T]he composer works through a perceptual, not a onceptual
process. He
perceives,
he selects, he combines, and is not in the least aware at
what point
meanings of
a different sort and significance grow into his works. All
he knows or
cares
about is the apprehension of the contours of form, for form
is everything.
(<I>STRS, </I>18)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<I>Form is everything. </I>That seems about as definitive
and as extreme a
declaration of formalist principles as could be desired. And
yet Van den
Toorn
actually manages to exceed the latterday Stravinsky's
formalism in two
distinct
ways. The first is by explicitly identifying the listener's
viewpoint and
role
with those attributed by Stravinsky to the composer,
something Stravinsky
never
thought to do. "One need merely substitute listener for
composer in the
above
quotations," Van den Toorn observes, "and the reasoning
becomes
impregnable"
(<I>STRS,</I> 19). It is not reasoning that is impregnable
here, however,
but a
tautology. The second strategy, inadvertent though it may
have been, was
misquotation. The last sentence in the extract, as published
by Craft and
Stravinsky, reads as follows: "All he knows or cares about
is his
apprehension of
the contour of <I>the </I>form, for <I>the </I>form is
everything."
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
As a Russian speaker, to be sure, Stravinsky must have
dropped his definite
articles in English every day. But what a difference they
make to the
sense here!
What Stravinsky evidently intended as a description of a
particular act
(composing) is transformed by Van den Toorn into a universal
aesthetic
stance.

<p>
It transpires, then, that Van den Toorn's hypothetical
listener is not
really
identified with this particular (or any particular)
composer. He inhabits a
hermetically sealed world of his own making, and he would
like to rest
there
undisturbed for the sake of the pleasure to be derived by
bonding, as it
were
intersubjectively, with the music he hears. In a later
article Van den
Toorn
makes this point yet more explicit:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[T]he source of the attraction, the source of our conscious
intellectual
concerns, is the passionate nature of the relationship that
is struck. But
this
relationship is given immediately in experience and is not
open to the
inquiry
that it inspires. Moments of aesthetic rapport, of
self-forgetting
at-oneness
with music, are immediate. The mind, losing itself in
contemplation,
becomes
immersed in the musical object, becomes one with that
object.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><I>The
music itself, </I>then, is really <I>the music myself.
</I>"Leave me alone
with
me," is Van den Toorn's ultimate plea to historians and
students of
culture, and
he speaks for a broad cohort. It is a perfectly reasonable
request, coming
from a
listener. Is it reasonable when it comes from a scholar? Or
do scholars
have
other responsibilities, public ones?

<p>
The formalist strategy just examined--that of authorizing
the
preoccupation with
"music itself" by identifying the listener's concerns with
those of the
composer--lies behind the analytical commonplace that to
understand (or,
more
precisely, to comprehend) something is to give an account of
its making. A
prominent music analyst was recently provoked by a hostile
reviewer into
formulating this perception as a maxim (albeit in the form
of a question):
"How
can anyone know <I>what </I>something is--i.e., be in a
position to make
aesthetic judgments about it--without knowing <I>how </I>it
is
made?"
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
To say this, of course, is to contradict a fundamental
precept of Arnold Schoenberg, one of the founders, as a
theorist, of the
modern
practice of musical analysis, and one of the primary
objects, as a
composer, of
the analytical practices here upheld. In a letter to his
brother-in-law,
the
violinist Rudolf Kolisch, who had worked out an exemplary
formalistic
analysis of
Schoenberg's Third Quartet, the composer wrote, "I can't
utter too many
warnings
against overrating these analyses, since after all they only
lead to what
I have
always been dead set against: seeing how it is <I>done;
</I>whereas I have
always
helped people to see: what it <I>is!" </I>And he admonished
Kolisch in
particular
that an accounting of the manufacture of music "is not where
the aesthetic
qualities reveal themselves."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
But then, Schoenberg did not at the time possess the notion
of "the music
itself," and, unlike Stravinsky, he did not live long enough
to pick it up.
Returning to a recent writer like Antokoletz and his
discussion of <I>The
Rite of
Spring, </I>we will not be surprised to find its purview,
like Van den
Toorn's,
resolutely purged of the "extramusical." The subject and
scenario have been
boiled down to the single remark that the ballet is "highly
ritualistic";
but
even that little trace is immediately turned into a
characterization of
"the
music itself": "In this highly ritualistic ballet, we find
the most
thorough-going use of narrow-range melodies, based on
nonfunctional
diatonic
modality, and constant repetition of short rhythmic motives
or phrases in
the
typically irregular meters of Russian folk music"
(<I>TCM1,</I> 94). For
the
rest, the description of <I>The Rite </I>is a description of
manufacture,
covering not only the "generation" of the individual work,
but of the way
in
which "Stravinsky transforms and expands the Russian
folk-music properties
into
an abstract set of pitch relations to form his own personal
contemporary
musical
language" (<I>TCM1, </I>96). Both curious and typical is the
identification of
Stravinsky's putative practical methods of construction with
theoretical
generalizations made many years after the fact by George
Perle ("interval
cycles") and Pieter van den Toorn ("octatonicism"). Method
is inferred from
"structure" and then attributed to the composer, whose work
is thus
rationalized
and rendered abstract.

And harmless. What is chiefly objectionable about such
analysis is not its
anachronism or its purloining of the composer's authority.
What is chiefly
objectionable 

<B></B>

 is its propensity to
normalize and, in yet another way, to
sanitize. To detect regularities and familiar patterns
beneath a
complicated or
unusual surface (for all that it contradicts the myth of
disruption) is
evidence
of analytical acumen; and so regularity of pattern is prized
and sought,
and
inevitably found. Consider Antokoletz's parsing of the
opening bassoon
solo in
<I>The Rite </I>in such a way as to demonstrate its
"structural balance"
and its
character as a "'closed off'" formal scheme (<I>TCM1,</I>
95-96; <a href=2.1taruskin_1.html> 1</a>).

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Stravinsky's adaptation of a Lithuanian folk melody is
cut up
into four segments, of which the first and last are held to
be a rhythmic
palindrome (1+4:5+1), and the middle pair are held to be a
hemiola
(2x3:3x2). By
separating the sixth note (A with fermata) from the
sixteenth-note group,
Antokoletz's segmentation contradicts Stravinsky's phrasing,
ignores the
obvious
melodic parallelism, and occludes the very cadential
structure the
segmentation
is supposed to be revealing. As to the middle pair, hemiolas
are only
hemiolas
when they take up the same amount of (notated) time. And
besides, the
separation
of the two segments is entirely an artifact of the
bar-placement, a
notational
convenience that both the phrasing and the explicitly
demanded "tempo
rubato"
conceal from the ear. Antokoletz has parsed the music as it
looks, not as
it
sounds. The whole analysis is a fiction designed to produce
a specious,
sanitary
("classical"?) regularity.

<p>
Tendentious segmentation is in fact a standard feature of
analysis that
purports
to reveal "the music itself."
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
What is revealed instead is a
germ-free vivarium, entirely "closed off," as Antokoletz
says, from the
world in
which the music was composed 

<B></B>

 and in
which it is experienced (<I>TCM1,</I>
95-96).
This utopian harmony seems maladapted, to say the least, to
Antokoletz's
general
view of twentieth-century music as a "revolutionary
transformation," an
"unprecedented departure" and a product of "historical
discontinuity," all
of
which, at first blush, connotes violence. But on reflection
it is all the
more
apparent that a reading of twentieth-century music as
"closed off" from
the past
is precisely what is necessary to clear space for such
utopian visions of
rational order as modern analysts propose. Yet reading such
analyses with
even
minimal historical awareness is discomfiting. One can only
wonder why such
well-behaved music should have evoked protests at its first
performance.

<p>
Robert Morgan's analysis of <I>The Rite, </I>in his
similarly titled
textbook, is
similarly normalizing and sanitizing. He describes the
famous ostinato
chord from
the "Augurs of Spring" as being only superficially what it
appears to be,
namely,
"a combination of two triadic structures, a dominant seventh
chord built on
E-flat and a major triad on F-flat." Such a description
(which Stravinsky,
it
should be noted, never outgrew) attempts an accomodation
with the
perceptual, if
not the conceptual, norms of an earlier practice, and
therefore violates
the
cardinal precept of the modernist myth. Rather, Morgan says,
the chord is
"an
integrated sonority with octatonic qualities" because it is
"largely,
though not
exclusively, drawn from the scale Eb-E-F#-G-A-Bb-C-Db-Eb"
(<I>TCM2,</I>
97).

<p>
Morgan's two descriptive comments are in contradiction: one
posits
integration,
the other ("largely, though not exclusively, drawn . . .")
posits
eclecticism,
but an eclecticism that is never acknowledged or accounted
for, since
Morgan
never says where the part of the chord comes from that is
not drawn from
the
octatonic scale he adduces. The discrepancy between the
object and its
description is swept under the rug.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The function of the
"Augurs"
chord, as Morgan describes it, is likewise normative and
reassuring: "the
chord
provides a basic pitch reference, or tonal focus, for the
entire section:
twice
interrupted by contrasting segments, it returns in unaltered
form," while
"even
the interruptions reveal the influence of this chord"
(<I>TCM2, </I>97).
So again
one wants to ask, Why the great Paris scandal? Why did
things get as far as
ting?

<p>
Morgan does try to account for the initial reaction by
admitting "the
harshness
of <I>The Rite," </I>owing to its "high level of dissonance
and
chromaticism"
(<I>TCM2, </I>97). He many have been responding to Arnold
Whittall's very
salutary reminder, in an article entitled "Music Analysis as
Human
Science?"
that, whatever the analytical premises from which it is
approached, "what
is most
significant" in <I>The Rite </I>"is the existence and
dominance of
discords."
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
This does need saying nowadays, and it does evoke
the
early reception of the work: after the first Russian
performance (under
Koussevitzky in Moscow in February 1914), the critic
Vyacheslav
Karat&iuml;gin
wrote in amazement that "from beginning to end there is not
a single pure
triad."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Whittall goes on to propose that "as a portrait of
human
savagery, the tragic power of <I>Le Sacre </I>may depend
precisely on the
freedom
for conflict to be expressed by the most immediate and
effective means."
This
sounds like a plea to restore the "extra-musical" dimension
that Van den
Toorn
and the others so zealously exclude. And yet even 

<B></B>

 Whittall does not
envision an
analytical practice that goes beyond "the music itself."
It's the nature
of the
beast to exclude the world, he finally agrees, in what seems
to me a very
pessimistic conclusion. "It may indeed be the case," he
concedes

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
that the "rules" of the game can only be discovered if the
discords are
"translated" into some other medium, in which they can be
examined without
the
psychological burden of their true character and quality.
For <I>Le Sacre
</I>remains an explosive work, and analysis may be
impossible unless the
score is
first defused.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Yet the myth of <I>The Rite </I>demands reinstatement of its
explosiveness, and
analysts are thus in a quandary. One way out is to imagine
<I>The Rite
</I>in a
dual aspect: as being one thing historically, quite another
thing
"essentially."
Those committed to maintaining the high disciplinary walls
that now
separate
"musicology" from "music theory" seem to have no trouble
with such a
divided
consciousness. The division, furthering methodological
purity, is seen as a
necessary ablution, a cleansing-of-the-hands that must
precede the delicate
operation by which "the music itself" is isolated and
dissected. The
sterility of
the theoretical discipline is itself seen as evidence of its
superior
condition.
Thus, asks V. Kofi Agawu, summarizing the case for
institutional isolation,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Has not the most influential historical work always needed
theory, whereas
the
best theoretical work rarely depended on the insights of
conventional
history? On
present showing, we might say that theory is theory and
history is
history, and
that although they may meet or clash sometimes, they remain
separate
disciplines.
To this writer at least, that ain't such a bad thing.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
I have no problem with Agawu's notion of a music history in
need of
theory. One
cannot visit the bathroom without theory. In my own
scholarly work, for
all that
I am classified, at least by Agawu, as a "historian," I
certainly have had
need
of theory, have freely helped myself to it, and even
contributed to it. As
for
theory in no need of history--well, that's his problem. But
the divided
consciousness Agawu asserts as healthy is what provides
writers like
Morgan with
a way out of the quandary to which I have referred. Morgan
prefaces his
normalizing, sanitizing account of <I>The Rite </I>as a
score with a
paragraph
devoted to <I>The Rite </I>as an event, in which a familiar
fable is
related:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If the Paris productions of <I>The Firebird </I>and
<I>Petrushka
</I>established
Stravinsky as a major composer of international reputation,
the score for
his
third Diaghilev ballet, <I>The Rite of Spring, </I>made him
the most widely
recognized composer of his age. The premi&egrave;re of
<I>The Rite </I>in
Paris
on May 29, 1913, is probably the most famous (or notorious)
premi&egrave;re in
the history of music. The ballet's scenic evocation of pagan
Russian
rituals
elicited from Stravinsky a score of unprecedented primitive
force, in
which music
seemed to be distilled to its rhythmic essence, hammered out
by the
orchestra
with unrestrained percussive intensity. Shaken by the
radical nature of
both
score and ballet, the opening-night audience was in an
uproar from the
beginning,
with those both for and against shouting at one another in
heated debate.
The
noise level was so high that most of the music remained
inaudible; yet if
nothing
else, the sensational aspect of the event placed Stravinsky
at the
forefront of
the musical revolutions of the time. For contemporary
listeners of <I>The
Rite,
</I>as for those of the first atonal works of Schoenberg,
music could
never be
the same again. (<I>TCM1,</I> 95-96)

<p>
Not a bad achievement for inaudible music. But again, as
always, the myth
accommodates contradictions. That is what myths are for. The
reality was
different. As the ballet historians Joan Acocella, Lynn
Garafola, and
Jonnie
Greene have put it, "the original <I>Rite of Spring </I>was
no sooner made
than
it was laid aside." With a sophistication that knows no peer
in the musical
literature on the work, they go on to observe that
"therefore while in the
historical record we call it a ballet, the way we actually
know it is as a
collection of ideas: ideas leading up to its creation,
together with ideas
leading away from the circumstances of its production."
These remarks come
at the
outset of a remarkable essay entitled <I>"The Rite of Spring
</I>Considered as a
Nineteenth-Century Ballet," in which the authors do what in
the
musicological
literature seems to be unthinkable: they insert the work
into a context
defined
by the past, not the future.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
They perceive no break with
tradition,
but manifold extensions of it. They go so far, in fact, as
to interpret the
reception history of <I>The Rite </I>as "a history of the
twentieth
century's
coping with its inheritance from the nineteenth"
("<I>TRS,</I>" 71). This
is
fabulously succinct and discerning, and provides the best
possible context
for
considering the sanitizing efforts I have been describing.

<p>
What did that nineteenth-century legacy consist of? First of
all, of
course, it
comprised primitivism, the belief that the qualities of
primitive or
chronologically early cultures are superior to those of
contemporary
civilization, or as the ballet historians put it, that "it
is those things
that
are least socialized, least civilized--children, peasants,
'savages,' raw
emotion, plain speech--that are closest to truth"
("<I>TRS,</I>" 68).
Primitivism
is often touted, especially in discussions of <I>The Rite of
Spring,
</I>as one
of those twentieth-century revolutions that cut our age off
from the past,
but it
has a very long history indeed. (As the ballet historians
shrewdly note,
"it is
one of the chief teachings of the New Testament"
["<I>TRS,</I>" 68].) It
was a
core constituent of Romanticism, against which the modern
(and again,
especially
<I>The Rite</I>) is so often and so wrongly construed as a
break. The idea
of
primitive immediacy of consciousness, of at-oneness with the
world, was at
the
very heart of the German romantic concept of
culture--<I>Kultur</I>--as
opposed
to the false <I>Zivilisation </I>of the Enlightenment (that
is, of
France), and
became the most basic component of the Germans' construction
of their
national
identity.
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
At the other end of the nineteenth century, the
end that
provided <I>The Rite </I>with its immediate background, the
idea surfaced
with
particular force in Russia, where in a curious semantic
switch, the
cognate word,
<I>kul'tura, </I>was associated with Enlightenment, and a
good ur-Slavic
synonym,
<I>stikhiya, </I>was pressed into service in the name of
primitive romantic
immediacy.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
All of this was brought to a head by the same
sense of
impending catastrophe that seized political and social
thinkers in the
aftermath
of the Emancipation with its great uprooting of the
peasantry, and horror
at "the
mockery that urban poverty made of the promises of the
Industrial
Revolution"
("<I>TRS,</I>" 68). "In our hearts," wrote the poet
Alexander Blok in
1908, "the
needle of a seismograph has twitched."
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
It was in the name of
a
maximalized primitivism that nineteenth-century romanticism
gave way to
twentieth-century revolutionary politics. 

<B></B>

<p>
Maximalized and desentimentalized primitivism leads to that
bleak vision
known as
biologism, "the belief that life is fundamentally its
physical facts:
birth,
death, survival" ("<I>TRS,</I>" 68) and that anything else
is mere
ornament and
palliative, a lie. Many were those who immediately saw this
in <I>The Rite
</I>and were afraid. Jacques Rivi&egrave;re, the editor of
the <I>Nouvelle
revue
fran&ccedil;aise, </I>who wrote the most prescient of all
review of the
ballet,
concluded the review with the flat statement that beneath
its
"sociological"
exterior "there is something even more momentous, there is a
second
meaning, more
secret, more frightful: <I>ce ballet est un ballet
biologique" </I>(this
ballet
is a biological ballet). And, he continued,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

 It is not just the dance of the most primitive man, it is
also the dance
before
there was man . . . . There is something profoundly blind in
this dance.
There is
an enormous question being carried about by all these
creatures moving
before our
eyes. It is in no way distinct from themselves. They carry
it about with
them
without understanding it, like an animal that turns in its
cage and never
tires
of butting its forehead against the bars. They have no other
organ than
their
whole organism, and it is with that that they carry on their
search. They
go
hither and thither and stop; they throw themselves forward
like a load,
and wait
. . . . Nothing precedes them; there is nothing to rejoin.
No ideal to
regain . .

its pumping,
knocks
against the walls of their skulls, so they ask for issue and
succession.
And
little by little, by dint of their patience and persistence,
a sort of
answer
comes, that is also nothing other than themselves, which
also meshes with
their
physical being, and which is life.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>It was the great thrust of
the
nineteenth-century science of anthropology to demystify
mythology, to
demote
myths from the status to which occultists like the
post-Wagnerians, the
Symbolists (and, of course, Scriabin) wished to re-elevate
them--the
belief that
myths represented "a record of contact between mortals and
the <I>au
del&agrave;"</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
--to that of metaphor for grim biological
realities. It was the project of Sir James Frazer, for
example, in his
<I>Golden
Bough, </I>to strip away the anecdotal content of myths and
the
metaphorical
content of rituals, and reveal the ruthless rites of
propitiation that lie
behind
them--the very thing that <I>The Rite of Spring </I>exposed.
So where
Scriabin's
occultism sought to elevate human consciousness above the
human plane, the
"second sense" of <I>The Rite of Spring </I>plunged it down
beneath,
suggesting
the prehuman or subhuman reality that civilized
consciousness cloaks but
does not
replace.

<p>
It was a threat not only to poetic mythologism, but to the
sanctity of
revealed
religion as well. As Leon Surette observes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Frazer's findings reduced the putatively unique event of
Christ's passion,
death,
and resurrection to just one of hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of such
deaths and
resurrections that have been enacted around the world from
the earliest
times.
Frazer's revelation that the solemn Christian mass is a
survival of bloodly
ritual murder and ritual cannibalism--even though he was
careful to avoid
explicitly drawing this obvious conclusion--can clearly
count as the
revelation
of a secret history.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
And there it was, no longer secret, on the stage of the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des
Champs-Elys&eacute;es. As Acocella, Garafola and Greene
observe about the
Chosen
Maiden, "had 

<B></B>

 the community simply sat
down and eaten her, this would have
made a
difference of tone, but not, arguably, of meaning"
("<I>TRS,</I>" 68). In
that
case they would have been celebrating the Eucharist.

<p>
Now before proceeding any further, the obvious objection
must be
addressed, that
everything that the trio of ballet historians and I have
been discussing
belongs
to the "extramusical" layer of <I>The Rite, </I>the
"scaffolding," as
Pieter van
den Toorn says, that has been rightly discarded over time in
favor of the
music,
"the edifice itself." But Stravinsky's contribution is not
so easily
separable
from the rest. And the metaphor of the edifice is all wrong
because it
suggests
permanence, while Stravinsky's music has undergone
change--the first and
most
decisive change being precisely its detachment from its
original context.

<p>
When Acocella, Garafola and Greene say that the "original"
<I>Rite </I>was
"laid
aside," we can assume that they mean Nijinsky's <I>Rite,
</I>not
Stravinsky's.
The original choreography was not only laid aside but
forgotten.
Deliberately
suppressed by Diaghilev following Nijinsky's departure from
his company,
and
replaced in 1920 by Massine's, it was only painstakingly and
(necessarily)
fairly
speculatively reconstructed by Millicent Hodson in the 1980s
for
performances
beginning in 1987 by the Joffrey Ballet.
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
After a hiatus of
three-quarters of a century, the Nijinsky choreography
possessed little
more than
an archeological or (early-modernist) period interest for
most observers,
and was
found inadequate by many dance critics.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Nijinsky's
contribution, it
is clear, has played a negligible role in the ballet's
history.

<p>
What binds all productions together, of course, is the
uniform presence of
the
score, which thus seems all the more compellingly to assume
the standing of
essential "edifice," to which everything else, including the
transitory
plastic
and visual embodiments, remains parasitic and, ultimately,
excrescent (the
"scaffolding").

<p>
And yet that score, too, was at first "laid aside." The
handful of
performances
it received in May and June of 1913 by the Ballets Russes in
Paris and
London was
followed by the two Russian concert premieres (Moscow and
St. Petersburg)
under
Koussevitzky the next February, and, finally, Monteux's
triumphant
performance at
the Salle Pleyel in the spring.

<p>
And that, for a long time, was it. It took a long while for
the score to
achieve
the awesome reputation we now assume it possessed from the
beginning. In
1913 it
was not the primary object of attention. The most cursory
perusal of the
Paris
reviews of the original production, conveniently collected
in Truman C.
Bullard's
dissertation, reveals that it was the now-forgotten Nijinsky
choreography,
far
more than Stravinsky's music, that fomented the famous
"riot" at the
premiere.
Many if not most reviews fail to deal with Stravinsky's
contribution at all
beyond naming him as composer. And, as most memoirs of the
premiere (and
even
Morgan's account of it) agree, a lot of the music went
unheard, which did
not
dissuade the protesters in the least. In the words of one
reviewer, "at
the end
of the Prelude the crowd simply stopped listening to the
music so that
they might
better amuse themselves with the choreography."
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
And the crowd
managed to turn Stravinsky against Nijinsky, giving him his
first reason
for
wanting to cleanse his score of "extramusical" taint.

<B></B>

<p>
The score was not published until 1921--that is, not until
Nijinsky's
contribution had been scratched and Stravinsky had begun, in
tendentious
interviews, the process of purifying the music. Only then
did the score's
victorious career begin in any real sense. The composer's
squeamishness was
conditioned in part, no doubt, by the initial "failure" of
the work as a
ballet,
a failure the composer felt alongside the choreographer all
through the war
years, his so-called "Swiss" period. Throughout that time,
for all that it
was
instantly his most notorious work, thoughts of <I>The Rite
</I>were tinged
for
Stravinsky with thoughts of defeat. Briefly despondent in
the fall of
1913, he
unburdened himself in a remarkably--indeed, practically
uniquely--self-revealing
letter to Alexandre Benois, a letter that betrays not only
the extent of
Stravinsky's emotional dependence on Diaghilev, but also the
extent of his
fear
about his own creative future in the wake of the <I>Rite
</I>fiasco:

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Here
we get an inkling of what it was that caused Stravinsky to
take refuge
from the
"extramusical" in "the music itself"--a creative swerve that
colored all
the rest
of his career. His reasons need not be our reasons. And yet
we seem to
have our
own reasons for laying the "original" <I>Rite </I>aside and
purging its
music. We
want to forget the ways in which Stravinsky's music
participated in the
great
stripdown from <I>kul'tura </I>to <I>stikhiya, </I>from
humanism to
biologism--ways that have always been salient and that used
to be

absence of a perceived threat, denial would have been
superfluous.

As has been observed in connection with Scriabin's late

<p>
Where Scriabin represented the eschatological collapse of
time and space
in a
music that was highly mobile in its darting root movements
within an
inversionally and transpositionally invariant harmonic
matrix,
Stravinsky's music
in <I>The Rite </I>was of a kind that prompted critic after
critic in
Russia to
resort to the word <I>nepodvizhnost'</I>--immobility--to
describe its
character
and affect. The long stretches of arrested root motion and
pulsing rhythm
that
analysts of "the music itself" now prefer to rationalize as
structurally
unifying--that is, reassuringly fulfilling a traditional
formal
mandate--were
originally heard (and are still easily heard) as the
annihilation of the
subject
and the denial of psychology.

<p>
Along with this immobility went a calculated formal disunity
and
disjunction--<I>drobnost' </I>in Russian, meaning the
quality of being a
sum-of-parts. Study of Stravinsky's sketchbook shows just
how deliberate
this
calculation was. Motivic or even full-blown thematic
relations that were
salient
in early sketches were ruthlessly attenuated as the music
was
"refined."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
The "art of transition" between sections is
famously
eschewed in favor of abrupt, lurching shifts, often coming,

of a section.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
The very ending of the first tableau is
similarly
unprepared, coming as a shocking halt rather than a
conclusion. There is
little
recall of the past in this music, and little forecasting of
the future; in
any
case, there is far less than is customary in concert music,
which is the
category, in the opinion of Stravinsky and the analysts, to
which we are
now
supposed to assign <I>The Rite.</I>

<p>
The absence of recall and forecast is an absence of
memory--precisely what
Rivi&egrave;re described in characterizing the subhuman
corpus (and what
Nietzsche, in a famous essay, defined as the crucial
lack--or
freedom--that sets
the animal kingdom apart from mankind).
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Carter sensed this
characteristic in Stravinsky's music, too. It was a
perception that began
with
the repetitive folk-tale plots of <I>Renard </I>and
<I>Histoire du soldat,
</I>both adapted from the collection of the
nineteenth-century ethnographer
Alexander Afanasyev.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In these two stories, the characters on stage and the
audience are dealt
with as
if they had no memory, as if living always in the present
and not learning
from
previous events--a dramatic situation that suggests the
puppet world, like
that
of Punch and Judy, as the authors certainly intended, and
also in a larger
sense
inescapable fate and universality of action such as that in
the Everyman
plays or
that of the shades in the Hades of Gide's libretto for
<I>Pers&eacute;phone
</I>who ceaselessly repeat the gesture of living.

&#009;Whatever the intention, this kind of almost disjointed
repetition
immeasurably increases the pathos of both works. In fact, I
came to
believe, as I
studied the soldier's part [for a performance under Lukas
Foss], that it
was just
because of this curious plot repetition, especially as it is
coupled with
music,
that, although almost continually different in tiny ways, is
always drawing
attention to its repetitive form.

<p>
In
<I>The Rite,
</I>unlike
<I>Histoire du soldat </I>with its very reflective title
character, the
elimination of memory does not increase the sense of pathos.
Rather, it
makes
pathos impossible. And that may be why even Carter resisted
the
<I>drobnost'
</I>of <I>The Rite, </I>preferring to view its harmonic
ostinatos as
"structures"
that "characterize and unify each dance," and even
speculating, as he
suggested
to Stravinsky (who declined to respond), that "all the
chords in the Sacre
were
related to one source chord," which he thought he had
discovered in the
introduction (where such a thing belonged).

<p>
Indeed, the global unifier in <I>The Rite </I>has been an
analytical
unicorn or
philosopher's stone, avidly hunted, found, asserted. Always,
it turns out,
some
transient recurrent feature has been seized upon and
exaggerated to the
status of
"universality," as when Robert Moevs asserted that the whole
ballet is in
the key
of D minor,
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
or when Messain/Boulez reduce it all to a rhythmic
cell.
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
I, too, have been susceptible to this
need,
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
and, I'm sure, one of the reasons why Allen Forte chose
<I>The Rite
</I>for his
first full-dress demonstration of his highly abstract
"set-theoretic"
technique
of harmonic analysis is because through its use he was able
to propose
solutions
to the famous enigma. The search for the global unifier, I
am convinced,
is not
motivated only by analytical preconceptions or by the wish
to give <I>The
Rite
</I>the academic respectability that is obviously its due.
Nor is it only
or
mainly the prestige that comes to any successful solver of
standing
problems that
motivates that constant search. It is a case of resistance
to a threat
that goes
far beyond the disciplinary limits of musicology.

<p>
That threat is hinted at in the third Russian word that was
often applied
to
<I>The Rite </I>when it was new: <I>uproshcheniye,
</I>simplification.
<I>The
Rite, </I>for all its novelty and its inscrutability and the
dazzling
virtuosity
of its orchestral presentation, is not a complex score.
Elaborate
analytical
procedures can make it look far more complicated than it is,
even if that
complexity is only there to be whittled down in turn to an
orderly
structural
scheme.
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
Why is this felt to be desirable? Because a rational
complexity is far less disturbing than a mystifying
simplicity.
Stravinsky's
radical simplification of texture, his static, vamping
harmonies, and his
repetitive, ostinato-driven forms, were the perfect musical
approach to the
primitivist ideal--the resolute shedding of conventional
complexities of
linear
thought and their replacement by long spans of unchanging
content,
accessible to
instant, as it were gnostic, apprehension and eliciting a
primitive,
kinesthetic
response.

<p>
Was this stripdown truly an <I>uproshchiniye, </I>a "second"
simplicity, a
synthesis vouchsafing a higher integration of thought and
feeling? Or was
it
merely what the Russians call an <I>oproshcheniye, </I>a
dehumanizing
retreat
from intellectual engagement and an impoverishment of
culture? That is a
question
that has never really gone away. It gave rise to a
controversy that
continued to
swirl about Stravinsky almost to the end of his career,
until
preoccupation with
"the music itself" and with the technology of its
production, a
preoccupation
Stravinsky did everything in his power to abet, managed to
marginalize it
at
last.

<p>
The view of Stravinsky as an apostle of <I>oproshcheniye,
</I>of course,
is the
view associated with Adorno, for whom Stravinsky's
simplified forms and
ego-annihilating ostinatos 

<B></B>

 spelled
"permanent regression." Adorno,
unfairly as it
may seem, seized upon an early Berlin review of <I>Renard
</I>that
interpreted
Stravinsky's primitivism (or "infantilism," as he preferred
to call it) as
"an
affirmative ideology," and noted that such an interpretation
"later
appeared in
Germany in a sinister context."
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
Yet how unfair is it, really,
inasmuch as we know now, far better than Adorno could have
known it, that
when
that sinister affirmative surfaced in Germany, Stravinsky
was highly
susceptible
to its allure?
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Ultimately we have to ask what kind of a drama
<I>The
Rite </I>embodies--that is, to what category shall it be
assigned? We have
seen
that Arnold Whittall associated its shocking musical
qualities with "tragic
power" and the expression of "conflict." But is that not a
sentimental
reading,
one that identifies with the Chosen One in a manner
supported neither by
the
scenario nor by the score? Was not the dance critic Andrey
Levinson closer
to the
mark when he called <I>The Rite </I>"an icy comedy of
primeval
hysteria"?
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
And was not Jacques Rivi&egrave;re correct when he
called special attention to the absence of conflict, even at
the
denoument? The
Chosen One, he exclaimed, betrays no "personal terror" at
all, even though
we
developed humans in our humanism cannot help assuming that
such terror
"must fill
her soul." On the contrary,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
She carries out a rite; she is absorbed into a social role,
and without
giving
any indication of comprehension or interpretation, she acts
according to
the will
and under the impact of a being more vast than she, of a
monster full of
ignorance and appetite, of cruelty and darkness . . . .
Mankind is
dominated by
something more inert than itself, more opaque, more
constraining--namely,
society
with its fellows.
<sup><a NAME="REF66"
HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup><!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
It is with that opaque, constraining force
that
Stravinsky's crashing orchestra, in the "Danse sacrale," is
clearly
identified,
and in its terrible dynamism it persuades us--nay, coerces
us--to share
its point
of view. Rarely has an antihumanist message been so
irresistibly
communicated.

<p>
 Even the ballet historians seem to offer a sentimental
reading of <I>The
Rite
</I>when they write that "the girl is forthrightly sent to
her death in
order to
benefit the community," and add that "the situation could
hardly be more
horrible" ("<I>TRS,</I>" 69). On the contrary, the
sacrificial dance is
presented
as anything but horrible--and that's what's horrible. The
ballet presents
and
celebrates an absolute absence of compassion as the
necessary correlate of
the
absence of "psychology," of human subjectivity. The Chosen
One, after all,
is one
of those beings initially presented in the first tableau as
an
<I>Adolescente,
</I>described by the composer (in a text he repeatedly
attempted to
disavow in
his interwar and cold-war phases) as being "not fully
formed: their sex is
unique
and double, like a tree."
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
This hermaphroditism is at the
opposite
evolutionary extreme from the androgyne, that perfected
being toward which
the
art of Scriabin (and the early Schoenberg) aspired. It is
the mark of an
unformed, insensate and expendable creature, and the
ballet's music, no
less than
its "extramusical" components, mark her for pitiless
forfeiture.

<p>
Now these are among the troubling aspects of <I>The Rite
</I>that the
discourse
of "the music itself" evades. That discourse is by no means
confined to
academic
analysis. It 

<B></B>

 dominates public criticism
of classical music as well, and the
evasion, when challenged, can turn quite explicit, as when
Samual Lipman of
<I>The New Criterion, </I>responding to <I>New York Times
</I>pieces about
Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky, denounces my "attempt to write
about music by
writing
about something else very much not music."
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
One senses the
same sort
of evasion in recent performances of <I>The Rite</I>--one
might even say,
in its
contemporary performance practice--where emphasis is placed
on fleet
precision
and on an athletic virtuosity that defies or ignore the
crushing strain
the music
was meant to evoke, and which it achieved far more
dependably when it
actually
strained the capabilities of its performers.
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The work becomes
all
the more troubling when one reflects, as Adorno did, on
other
manifestations of
that special congeries of ideas that <I>The Rite
</I>embodies. The
discussion by
Acocella, Garafola, and Greene, following that of
Rivi&egrave;re,
emphasized the
darker aspects of primitivism--biologism, sacrifice of the
individual to
the
community, absence of compassion, submission to compulsion,
all within a
context
defined by Russian or Slavic national folklore. Now here is
a list drawn
up by a
prominent contemporary social philosopher in an attempt to
detail the
"coherent
cluster of values and ideas" that, he maintains, governed
the policies of
the
Nazi regime: "nationalism, biologism, communalism,
hierarchy, corporatism,
acceptance of authority, territoriality, aggression,
rejection of
compassion." I
hope it is evident that these hair-raising correspondences
are not adduced
in
order to establish guilt by association. As Professor
Gellner put it of
his list,
"this cluster did not simply spring out of the head of
Hitler [or, I'll
add, of
Stravinsky]; it has its roots in European history and ideas,
and deserves
investigation."
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
That is precisely what I would like to
maintain
about <I>The Rite of Spring.</I>

<p>
Rigorous musical analysis of a professional caliber must
have a place of
honor in
any such investigation, for the music plays the primary role
in carrying
to our
minds and hearts whatever cluster of values and ideas <I>The
Rite </I>or
any
other Stravinsky composition may embody. Can such an
analysis be
accomplished
without "defusing" the work, as Arnold Whittall suggests it
must? I hope
that as
the boundaries between "history" and "theory," between
historiography and
criticism, and between "the extramusical" and "the music
itself" continue
to
soften, and eventually dissolve, we will find it less
difficult to believe
that
it can.

[T]he question of an engaging context is an aesthetic as
well as an
historical
and analytic-theoretical one. And once a body of works
begins to assert
itself
along these lines, once individual works take hold on an
immediate basis
so that,
to an increasing extent, they prevail for what they are in
and of
themselves, not
for what they represent, then context itself, as a
reflection of this
transcendence, becomes less dependent on matters of
historical placement.
A great
variety of contexts can suggest themselves, as attention is
focused on the
works
themselves, on the nature of both their immediacy and the

Antokoletz purports here to develop ideas proposed by Pierre

a
section entitled, revealingly enough, "Toward a

however, is not the same as Antokoletz's, and is not subject

Similarly, in the seminal article in which the octatonic
scale was
christened, Arthur Berger infers from a passage in <I>Les
Noces </I>the as
yet
unnamed "referential collection of eight pitch classes" that
"accounts for
it
all--with a few exceptions so marginal as scarcely to
require mention
(some dozen
tones, mainly ornamental)" ("Problems of Pitch Organization
in Stravinsky"
[1963]
in <I>Perspectives on Schoenberg and Stravinsky, </I>ed.
Benjamin Boretz
and
Edward T. Cone [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1968], 132). Since
nowhere
are criteria stated by which the structural and the
ornamental are
distinguished,
one must conclude that referability to the referential
collection is the
tacit
criterion, one that bends the argument, characteristically,
into a circle.
The
"ornamental" pitches, of course, have since proved
"structural" by
reference to
another analytical template (details in R. Taruskin,

Who can say whether "Le Sacre du Printemps" was in fact the
great modernist
masterpiece that it is now claimed to be? Perhaps it was
something more
like the
shaggy, dull, pseudo-folkloric thing that we saw in the
Joffrey Ballet
"reconstruction." Many of those who were disappointed by the
Joffrey
version
simply concluded that its flatness was due to its having
been put together
from
such scrappy evidence--in other words, that it wasn't really
Nijinsky. But
who
knows?

This observation applies in particular to the "Games" in the
first
tableau,
the "Game of Abduction" (<I>"Igra um&iuml;kaniya,"
</I>called the "Jeu du
rapt"
in the published score) and the "Game of Cities" (<I>"Igra
dvukh
gorodov"</I>/"Jeu des cit&eacute;s rivales"). They were
included in the
scenario
in response to a single passage in the Kieven Primary
Chronicle--see R.

Scenario," in
<I>Music and Civilization: Essays in Honor of Paul Henry
Lang, </I>ed.
Edmond
Strainchamps and Maria Rika Maniates (New York: Norton,
1984),
183-202--and were
originally sketched as a unit, with many thematic ideas in
common. Later
Stravinsky had no hesitation in detaching the "Game of
Abduction" from its
companion and inserting it in a much earlier position in the
score
(between the
"Augures printaniers" and the "Rondes printani&egrave;res").
Not only are
the
earlier thematic associations obscured, but the new
placement also
disrupts the
thematic links that had unified the pair of dances ("Les
Augures
Printaniers" and
"Rondes Printani&egrave;res") between which the "Game of
Abduction" now
intrudes
(full details forthcoming in R. Taruskin, <I>Stravinsky and

<p>
Upon the publication of C&eacute;line's first novel,
<I>Voyage au bout de la nuit, </I>Cendrars wrote to his
friend Jacques-Henri L&eacute;vesque:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . I am really surprised that in this flood of articles
no one remembers <I>Moravagine, </I>which, already ten years
ago, contained <I>all the themes </I>of <I>Voyage au bout de
la nuit </I>which today cause so much ink to flow: war,
flight, America, life among the savages, madness, eroticism,
suburbia, doctors, etc.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
One can understand Cendrars's disappointment about both the
reception of <I>Moravagine </I>and the ignored parallels
with C&eacute;line's novel. First, the climate of reception
had changed. When the three editors of
<I>Litt&eacute;rature, </I>Breton, Soupault, and Aragon, had
published extracts from the still unpublished novel in 1919,
<I>Moravagine </I>had plainly influenced the three young
writers still in search of what was to become Surrealism;
but by the time the novel was published in 1926, its
shock-effect had diminished. Moreover, despite its violence,
eroticism, nihilism, madness, rebellion, and adventure,
<I>Moravagine </I>could not be perceived as a popular novel,
unlike C&eacute;line's novel with the colloquial language
rhythms that were its greatest literary innovation. Cendrars
had remained in the avant-garde tradition, now writing
poetic prose as powerful and unexpected as his proselike
poetry from before the war. Second, Cendrars had good reason
to be surprised about the ignored parallels with
C&eacute;line's novel: the similarities between

<B></B>

 <I>Moravagine </I>and <I>Voyage au bout
de la nuit </I>are
flagrant, and I do not know why no one has chosen to explore
them. Both novels have doctor-narrators, C&eacute;line's
Bardamu and Cendrars's Raymond, and both doctors have
complex, obsessional relationships with mad doubles--Bardamu
with Robinson, who lives like an outlaw and precedes Bardamu
in all his escapades, whether to the front, Africa, or
America, and whose death from morphine injections ends the
novel; and Raymond with Moravagine, whom he frees to lead an
outlaw life, who drags Raymond across Germany, Russia, North
and South America, and who haunts Raymond's imagination at
the front. Like Robinson, Moravagine dies from morphine at
the end. Even the name Moravagine finds its counterpart in
C&eacute;line's Doctor Parapine (playing, I suppose,
hoist-the-male-member to Cendrars's death-to-the-vagina).
Parapine lies in wait for little girls outside schools and
ends up in an asylum; Cendrars begins with Moravagine in an
asylum, and after Raymond helps him to escape he immediately
begins killing little girls.

<p>
My purpose here, however, is not to make a full-scale
comparison, but to highlight the absence of what we would
surely expect to be a major concern in both novels--the
world war in which both authors fought. This war, though
vital to the narratives, is almost absent from the writing,
as if the two fictional narrator-doctors purposely refuse to
grant it the importance it clamors for. Perhaps they are
effecting a cure, as it were, of war. C&eacute;line allots
about sixty pages to the war--scenes with no combat or
death--in order to open a novel of five hundred pages;
Cendrars reduces World War I to three pages in three hundred
and sixty. And yet Cendrars, in his letter to
L&eacute;vesque, mentions the war as the first in the list
of common themes, an indication of his awareness that the
war is the real subject of both works. My proposed topic is
this enormous presence in the form of near-absence, this
gap, possibly a memory gap, in <I>Moravagine. </I>I will
examine this void in <I>Moravagine </I>before returning, at
the end, to C&eacute;line for comparison.

<p>
It is well known that there are lacunae or memory gaps in
<I>Moravagine. </I>Nearly twenty years ago, Stephen
Bellstrom analyzed the day that Raymond completely forgets
during the assassination attempt in Russia.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Later, Raymond loses consciousness for several weeks while
he and Moravagine flee the Jivaro Indians. As a general
rule, Raymond, who is the narrator of an adventure book,
never actually experiences any adventure. Even when he
participates, as he does in the plot to blow up the
polytechnic school in Moscow, he is so absent from the event
he cannot be sure it has occurred. Mich&egrave;le Touret has
described Raymond as a fictional narrator who is no longer
able to narrate. She demonstrates that it is not only
Raymond but the entire narrative authority that collapses as
a result of these lapses in consciousness.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The
very story stumbles along with him, just as he seems to flee
it. Raymond never witnesses violence, and he never sees
Moravagine killing or tearing open a woman; yet this is the
primary symbolic act of the novel, one that is announced in
the very title and name of the hero. Raymond's complete
absence from what appears essential to the narrative might
give rise to a reading of schizophrenia. Such a reading
would find a Raymond-la-Science playing a Dr. Jekyll who
hides from himself his evil incarnation 

<B></B>

as Mr. Hyde. And he
would be perfectly justified in concealing Hyde from Jekyll,
who would not survive the revelation of the horror at the
heart of his being. This horror will be placed ouside, in
<I>Moravagine. </I>Raymond demands to be heard, even if he
has not actually seen the horrors he tells. By presenting
himself as the narrator, he constructs himself as a witness.
<I>Moravagine </I>remains the story, told by Raymond, of all
the possible sorts of violence--that is, all the violence
that the doctor Raymond can imagine--with the notable
exception of the violence of war. War then, is, the ultimate
violence, engulfing everything at once, and while it appears
to be the logical outcome of Moravagine's activities, it
brings the novel and its narrator to a sudden halt. The
narrative rushes through the war in a three-page chapter,
hastening to more congenial ground in a concluding prison
scene. It is not only Raymond who loses control, as he
always does with the women's murders; it is as if language
itself were also forced to falter. Thus Robert Llambias has
written about C&eacute;line: "the writing manifests its own
failure at the very moment of description. Is the war, then,
not first of all the sickness of language?"
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
But here is the first major difference I would like to draw
between C&eacute;line and Cendrars: the war inaugurates
<I>Voyage au bout de la nuit, </I>but the author manages to
rediscover his language in its wake; we may even say that
language is victorious over war in C&eacute;line's work. In
<I>Moravagine, </I>on the other hand, the three pages of war
end the adventures of the hero, who is left with one
incomprehensible word, a word that means everything but is
in Martian. Here, then, are two very different responses to
the illness that war instills in language.

<p>
While the war is a lacuna in the narrative that neither
Raymond nor Moravagine can fill, both characters live in a
world full of violence that they willingly provoke. What is
the nature of their violent acts that are so incompatible
with the ultimate violence of war?

<p>
For a start, one could say Moravagine is an anarchist. This,
in fact, is the role he plays in Russia. Here the novel is
full of politics, social revolution, terrorism, and all
sorts of anarchist activism about which the novelist knew
little, if we are to believe Emile Szittya, Cendrars's
prewar friend and fellow editor of <I>Les Hommes nouveaux;
</I>for Szittya, Cendrars was an "idealistic, strictly
philosophical" anarchist.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Act and philosophy
coexist together in <I>Moravagine </I>when, for example, the
terrorists claim allegiance to Prince Kropotkine, who is
obliged to disinherit them because they massacre their own
companions. Moravagine's violence against his own fellows is
the ultimate anarchism, because it sows the seeds of
anarchism in anarchism itself. Cendrars's anarchism, which I
will call cultural, suggests that we pay particular
attention to the anarchist temptation, that is, the
temptation of the intellectual doctor Raymond. In
Moravagine, anarchism is pure and absolute; in Raymond, it
is problematized.

<p>
Though Cendrars was never, as far as we know, an active
political anarchist, he was certainly raised on anarchist
fare and circulated among anarchists prior to World War I.
The name of Kropotkine does not appear in <I>Moravagine
</I>out of nowhere; Cendrars was born in La Chaux-de-Fonds,
a small town in Switzerland which was 

<B></B>

one of the most
important centers of the watchmaking industry, (Le Corbusier
was born there in the same year, and began his working life
designing fob-watch covers.) It was from this town that
Kropotkine organized his anarchist activities in Europe, for
example editing the Jura Federation's newsletter, <I>Le
R&eacute;volt&eacute;. </I>While the Prince was active in
the Jura only before Cendrars's birth, the area had a long
tradition of anarchist sympathies which had certainly not
weakened during Cendrars's youth. Cendrars also became an
avid reader of Elis&eacute;e Reclus's famous <I>Geographie
universelle, </I>and while we might think his interest to
have been primarily in travel to exotic places, his
adventurous poetry and fiction betray the populist attitudes
of both Reclus and Kropotkine.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
After living in Saint Petersburg during the 1905 uprisings
and again in 1911, Cendrars followed his girlfriend,
F&eacute;la Poznanska, to New York. F&eacute;la taught for a
while at the Ferrer School, founded by Emma Goldman and
other anarchists and named in honor of Francesco Ferrer, a
Spanish educator and anarchist executed in Spain in 1910.
Cendrars most certainly attended evening lectures and
discussions at this "modern" school, directed at the time by
a very young Will Durant (Ariel was a student, and her
fanciful name was typical for this particular student body).

<p>
Around June 1912, Cendrars returned to Paris with a lecture
on "Beaut&eacute; et anarchisme" ("Beauty and Anarchism"),
which he would read to the <I>Club lib&eacute;ral de
discussion </I>in September. In the meantime, he again
linked up with Szittya to transform the latter's more
political <I>Neue Menschen </I>(Paris, 1910; Munich, 1911)
into <I>Les Hommes Nouveaux, </I>where "Anarchismus und
Sch&ouml;nheit" ("Anarchism and Beauty"), by "Jack Lee,"
appeared in October, along with the first article ever
published on the French anarchist Andr&eacute; Suar&egrave;s
(Cendrars later said that he had written this, but it is
signed by another editor, Marius Hanot). The editors
frequented a caf&eacute; on the rue Cujas, where, as Szittya
had it, all the anarchists running from the police would
loiter before they were arrested. The same caf&eacute;
appears in <I>Moravagine, </I>full of Russian
spies.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
From 1911-1913, Parisian newspapers were full of headlines
about the Bonnot gang. (When Bonnot was finally trapped in a
barn and killed, he received more press coverage than the
sinking of the <I>Titanic </I>the previous week). This
loosely organized group, consisting mainly of bandits with
anarchist ties, robbed banks and made their getaways in
cars. Though Cendrars did not know Bonnot, he did know
people associated with him--Victor Kibaltchich, for example,
who was editing the journal <I>L'Anarchie. </I>Arrested for
complicity in the gang's activities, Kibaltchich served five
years in prison and then was exiled from France. He adopted
the pseudonym Victor Serge and participated in the
anarchist-syndicalist uprisings in Barcelona. These events
provide the backdrop, if not the model, for the framework of
<I>Moravagine</I>--the narrator "R . . . " awaits execution
in a Spanish prison in 1924. A few years later, Serge
translated Cendrars's <I>L'Or </I>into
Russian.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
(Eisenstein tried to film the novel
when he went to Hollywood.) The narrator "R . . . ",
however, is also saddled with another identity from the
ranks of the Bonnot gang, Raymond Callemin, nicknamed
Raymond-la-Science for his cool demeanor. In a radio
interview 

<B></B>

 from the 1950's, Cendrars
claimed to have known
Callemin; in the preface to <I>Moravagine, </I>he writes,
"If we admit that R. exists . . . then we have to assume he
is Raymond-la-Science" (<I>M,</I> 239).
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
The
novel, however, is not only a neat <I>roman &agrave; clef,
</I>but also a game of false identities and obvious masks;
Raymond-la-Science had been executed in 1913, a dozen years
before Cendrars executes him "novelistically" in Spain in
1924, and there is no doubt that Cendrars would have
expected his readers to remember the Bonnot gang trials.

<p>
Zamuel Blazek, whom Szittya mentions, presents another
anarchist trail we might follow into <I>Moravagine.
</I>Szittya reports that Blazek was the author of a short
story in which a man committed revolutionary acts as a
result of sexual perversity, and, as Bellstrom has shown,
Cendrars drew so heavily on Blazek's short story, even using
Blazek's character Mascha without changing her name, that it
was certainly a case of plagiarism.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
In the
recently published correspondence quoted at the beginning of
this essay, Cendrars reveals that two other characters in
<I>Moravagine, </I>A.A.A. and Z.Z.Z., are based on
anarchists he met, Z.Z.Z. standing for Zamuel Blazek
(<I>JEM, </I>482). Their words in the novel are the words of
the real men, as remembered by Cendrars; this would mean
Cendrars placed Blazek inside Blazek's own fiction!

<p>
Anarchistically, <I>Moravagine </I>is an array of slippery
identities and unattributable subversions. It is a novel
fraught with anarchist influences and representations, some
flagrant, others more subtle. The history of anarchism and
the stories of obscure anarchists sustain a worldview hungry
for political and social freedom, and that hunger functions
like a vacuum that only the mythical Moravagine can fill
absolutely.

<p>
Moravagine seeks to be completely free. He dreams like Dada,
but Dada before Dadaism, before freedom had a
program.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
In this respect, he is
extraordinarily seductive, and he takes control of any
undertaking that he joins. But he never carries through;
before accomplishing anything, he has to disappear or flee,
because any success would abolish his perpetual anarchism.
This ideal or idealistic anarchism is not monistic; it has
its counterpart in the irrational, in a violence that
opposes all order or completeness. In the end, Raymond the
alienated scientist is seduced by the violence of
Moravagine, the great human beast with an unleashed ability
to put suppressed desire into action.

<p>
Before the world goes to war, Moravagine makes war against
the world. He always seeks the origin in order to destroy
it, which is impossible and, therefore, desirable. He
searches for the primordial rhythm in Berlin and nihilism in
Moscow; he seeks the first human civilization on the shores
of the Oronoco river, where he preaches matriarchy to the
Indians and then escapes down the Amazon, "the most ancient
river of the globe, in this valley that is the matrix of the
world. . . . " (<I>M,</I> 382).
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
He destroys
neither Berlin nor Saint Petersburg nor Amazonia, but only
the women who live there. He cannot go any further in his
anarchist--that is, individual and symbolic--destruction
than by tearing open women, one by one. Moravagine assumes
the right to commit these murders all the more freely on the
grounds that he was born fatherless and his mother died in
childbirth. This emotional inadequacy of an imprisoned
individual translates itself into universal privation only
when Raymond the doctor 

<B></B>

 releases him
from the asylum.
Raymond considers himself a healer not of illness but of the
world's artificial health; he wants to change the world
radically, to destroy its oppressive, bourgeois meliorism.
Moravagine does not actually desire what he performs, but
plays the role of desire itself; he is action without a
consciousness, enacting whatever Raymond wishes or is afraid
of wishing. After the death of Rita, especially after the
extinction of her gaze, for him a source of life, Moravagine
has lost all interest in life; he has become a Narcissus
without a mirror. In his prison, he has been emptied of any
desire and has become a void that awaits Raymond's projected
desires. Moravagine is "cold, self-controlled, without
illusion, blas&eacute;," and he takes over every action,
"indifferent like a God, indifferent like an idiot" (<I>M,
</I>310).
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
He is so aware of the danger he
represents that he himself warns:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I am not of your race. I am from the Mongol clan that
revealed a monstrous truth--the truth of life, the knowledge
of rhythm--and that will always ravage your stagnant homes.
. . . My stallion is wilder than your cogwheel; my hoofs of
horn are more dangerous than your iron wheels. Surround me
with your hundred thousand bayonets of western light,
because woe to you if I emerge from my dark cave to chase
your trail. . . . Tremble if I emerge from your walls as
from Attila's tent, masked, terrifyingly overgrown, cloaked
only in my hood, like my companions in the convict prison at
the hour of their death walk, and if with my strangling
hands, my hands reddened by the cold, I rip open the frail
stomach of your civilization! [<I>M, </I>279]
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
If it is clear that Moravagine is not human, it is equally
clear that he is not simply an allegory. He is at least
doubly anarchic: he is the dream of freedom in excess, of
the continuous re-creation of the self, and, at the same
time, the dream of fascist power, the power to enact one's
violence with impunity. He is the double dream of Raymond
who has never "known" women, but who simultaneously wants to
free himself from them and punish them. The Raymond who
desires (and who, more precisely, desires to transcribe his
narrative of desire) writes Moravagine the Mongol into the
world as a double--the "it" or psychoanalytic id, and the
"libertine" Mongol. Cendrars chooses the term "libertine" to
indicate "him who lives in freedom of thought and,
especially, feeling."
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Both are seductive: the
libertine, because we desire to enjoy all kinds of liberty;
the id, because it dares to defy all that is forbidden. It
remains up to Raymond to justify this coupling, and to
explain, for example, how a woman's masochism instigates a
free man's violence.

<p>
Masochism, we learn from Raymond's argument, extends from
women to Jews, to the revolution that is Jewish, to
civilization, to the whole world, and finally to the
principle of origin itself, which brings us back to the
woman. The love that creates all is also the desire for
death and effacement of the self. With this conclusion,
Raymond is not far from Freud's cultural criticism in
<I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle, </I>published in 1920. But
Raymond tinges his analysis with a total masochism that has
nothing to impart other than raging hatred. What is
important in the novel is not so much the masochism of
women, but the profound disgust that the feminine provokes
in Raymond, precisely because woman is in charge of love and
all creation, and she 

<B></B>

 remains
triumphant over male attempts
to control her or free himself of her (<I>M,
</I>291-94).
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Controlling her would be
patriarchy; freeing himself of her would be anarchy. Raymond
chooses anarchy when he follows Moravagine. In any case,
this choice is also a dead end, for it acknowledges the
superiority of the opponent. From here stems the fundamental
violence in Moravagine's anarchy; the violence emerges from
Raymond's despair to find a freedom for men without women, a
homeland, or any bonds whatsoever. The violence that is
impotent and suppressed in Raymond finds free rein in
Moravagine; for his Doctor Caligari, the Mongol effects a
double cure for the lack of liberty and the lack of power.
It is only at the very end of the story, which is placed as
a frame at the beginning of the narrative, and only after
the death of Moravagine, that Raymond acts for himself and
becomes an anarchist and a regicide in his own name.

<p>
But before Raymond frees the Moravagine in himself, there is
a whole novel about the unleashing of a being's anarchic
forces by the skewed sciences of modernity. In the
foreground is psychiatry, which Raymond seeks to indict when
he arrives at Waldensee in 1900. (One wonders if Cendrars
knew that Jung had left Basel in the same year with the
intention of making the very same indictment at a
psychiatric hospital in Zurich.) The novel begins with this
double-edged character, a Raymond who is "impatient to free
himself from the Institution" (<I>M,</I> 243), but also an
ironic Raymond, the narrator who has already been revealed
to the reader as a future regicide.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Raymond
says that psychiatry, once the keeper of mental health, is
now surpassed by psychoanalysis, the new "pataphysics" of
Freud, which is first put into practice at Dr. Stein's.
Raymond seeks to shock the psychiatrists by rejecting their
prejudices about normal health, "a normal, absolute, fixed
state," and he vows to become even more scientific and view
illness "objectively, amorally, intellectually" (<I>M,</I>
242).
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Quickly seduced by Moravagine's powerful
madness, Raymond offers criticisms that already reveal his
youthful fantasy of making his mark. Nevertheless, his
initiative against psychiatry as the keeper of health
remains likeable. Actually, Cendrars is not alone among
writers of this period to offer us an individual hero
suffering at the hands of a psychiatry that epitomizes
modern science operating in the service of outdated regimes.
Examples are Thomas Mann's <I>The Magic Mountain </I>
and Robert Wiene's <I>Cabinet de Dr. Caligari </I>, a
film that Cendrars reviewed for <I>Feuilles
libres.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
T. S. Eliot's <I>The Waste Land
</I>also draws its source from the same rejection of
authority disguised as spiritual healing; Eliot actually
wrote part five of his manuscript at Dr. Vittoz's "rest
home" in Lausanne. Cendrars, we should recall, defended the
renegade psychoanalyst Otto Gross when the latter's father,
a well-known criminologist, placed him in an insane asylum.
"[This is] the shameful behavior of a narrow-minded father
(all our fathers are narrow-minded) . . ." Cendrars wrote in
<I>Revolution, </I>a German avant-garde
journal.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Compared to the hypocritical use of a
whole army of shiny machinery to impose order in Stein's
sanatorium--"They have silver rectums and vulvae in chromed
leather. . . . They pronounce themselves spiritual directors
of the spinal cord and coldly practice the laparotomy of
consciences" (<I>M,</I> 246)--Raymond's decision to free

<B></B>

 an
"incurable" patient seems simple humanitarian
compassion.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
We may doubt his intentions, but
we are seduced by the attempt. Jung also linked himself with
a presumably incurable patient; he helped Otto Gross escape.
This helps to put Gross, guru to the von Richthofen sisters
(Frieda married D. H. Lawrence, Elsa had a long affair with
the famous sociologist, Max Weber), at the top of the list
of models for Moravagine.

<p>
There is an attitude in the novel toward machinery which
seems contradictory and is worth examining before finally
addressing the lacuna of war. In his early youth, Moravagine
had associated machinery with freedom: "all the mechanical
noises of motors, all the activities of the machine have
been linked since then with vast images of light, sky,
space, grandeur, liberty . . . " (<I>M,
</I>259).
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
As a result, once the "sinister old
man of Vienna" ("sinistre vieillard de Vienne," [<I>M,
</I>261-62]) has deprived him of Rita, Moravagine transfers
his eroticism to machines and manufactured objects: "The
sewing machine was like the outline, the cross-section of a
courtesan, a mechanic demonstration of the music-hall
dancer's power" (<I>M, </I>266).
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Later, in
prison in Presburg, he is forced to annul his own senses and
must disappear into his imagination. It is then that he
becomes the Mongol, "wilder than your cogwheel" and "more
dangerous than your iron wheels." The machines, in that
first context of love, are the purveyors of freedom, loving
and flying, but in the context of imprisonment, they are
agents of repression. For Cendrars, modern machinery is not
an unequivocal good, and we should read more carefully the
passage in the novel which is always interpreted as
Cendrars's own proclamation on the principle of utility. In
the chapter, "Nos radonn&eacute;es en Am&eacute;rique,"
Cendrars does not eulogize the machine, but praises its
function as an extension of the creative hand of man who
molds, unconsciously and in apparent disorder, the world
around him, which thereby emerges as his representation. The
anarchy of individualist capitalism is analogous to the
first stirrings of the imagination in prehistory when
"primitive man . . . put a handle on his stone axe"
(<I>M,</I> 345).
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
But one should not be duped by
this machine which, once detached from the worker's hand, no
longer represents him (or man in general). It is in this
context that one should read the poignant text Moravagine
writes by hand, a prose-poem presenting the Mongol's last
coherent words:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

petrified. All science should be ordered like a fruit; it

telescopes, scissors, amperes, irons, etc.--that's all
razzle-dazzle for the crowd.

<p>
After all the anarchic violence against politics,
civilization, and healing, against anarchy itself, and even
against the matrix of all these--women--the novel suddenly
changes tone when it encounters the "magnificent people of
Levallois-Perret and Courbevoie, blue-collar workers,
mechanics who work on cars and airplanes" 

<B></B>

 (<I>M,
</I>385).
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Now the fine optimism of the machine
takes charge of the narrative. As if healed, Moravagine
lives out his childhood dream of flying in the air to the
sound of a motor. The engineer who designs the propellor is
called Blaise Cendrars; this is a sure sign of how well
things are going. Raymond is exiled to a sanctuary of sorts
between the two towers of Chartres cathedral, where he
resumes the drudgery of scholarship, since he has lost his
"great wild beast" and can no longer live. Without Raymond,
Moravagine can enter into his beautiful machine to realize
his dream of freedom. But something more powerful
intervenes--it is the war with its "thousand bayonets," and
Moravagine is forced to disappear.

<p>
In the short chapter that follows, entitled "la guerre"
("the war"), Moravagine's status changes entirely; he now
exists only in Raymond's dreams. Since the machinery has
passed into the hands of the old men of the state, Raymond
becomes merely "cannon fodder" ("chair &agrave; canon,"
[<I>M,</I> 395]) without his friend. He dreams of even
greater destruction--if only "Moravagine had had access to
these weapons, funds, factories, gas, and guns" (<I>M,</I>
396).
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
But it is clear that Moravagine is no
longer there, that he has been textually surpassed by the
enormity of the war that requires so few words to make its
impact felt. On the one hand, he is reduced to committing
what Raymond calls a banality--an attempted personal assault
on the emperor Franz-Joseph. On the other hand, Moravagine
haunts Raymond's imagination; he becomes Raymond's "guardian
angel" and teaches him "apache tricks" to outwit the enemy.
The war is transposed into a child's game, as in Cendrars's
superb poem <I>Guerre au Luxembourg, </I>in which the game
permits warring without being present at the battlefield.
This chapter is also noteworthy because it resembles, and is
in fact almost a mirror image of, Cendrars's personal
experience in the war as he relates it in the "Pro-Domo," a
thirty-page description of how he wrote the novel (the
"Pro-Domo" was appended to the novel itself). At this moment
in the novel, Raymond becomes Cendrars--both are saved by
the same "apache," Moravagine, cast as a good Samaritan who
picks up the wounded at the farmhouse in Champagne
(<I>M,</I> 395).
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
By spreading atrocities and assuming a patriotic hypocrisy
about the seeds of horror that it sows, war reduces the
anarchist act to insignificance. Civilization claims for
itself the violence of the Mongol whom it has suppressed or
sublimated. A mutilated Raymond says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I felt in my very gut the shame of being human and of having
collaborated. . . . The War. Philosophies, religions, the
arts, techniques, professions--all result in this. The
finest flowers of civilization. . . . What is shameful is to
kill in gangs at a certain time, on a given day, in honor of
certain principles, in the name of a flag, under the
surveillance of old men. . . . [<I>M,</I>
402-3]
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
So the war is the battle of old men and patriarchs such as
Franz-Joseph, who haunts Moravagine's youth and motivates
his last act. Moravagine flies solo from Paris to Berlin to
drop a bomb on the tyrant's palace; but his protest in the
name of liberty has no effect on the determination of the
State or on the insistence of entire civilizations that we
rush to war. His solitary act, once the symptom of an
internal disorder 

<B></B>

 that was constantly
repressed, loses its
raison d'&ecirc;tre in the presence of war. The State,
established in the name of a mythology called Justice for
the express purpose of resolving arguments between the haves
and the have-nots, now rallies everyone to go after the
other, some foreigner; this other, whom we do not need to
know, will become the only have-not. Enlightened by the war
and the loss of his leg, Raymond realizes that Moravagine
will always be this stranger, and yet also his brother. The
anarchist Moravagine cannot even conceive of property since
property is the first theft, this is why he undermines the
State while foreseeing and preparing the war that will
eliminate him.

<p>
Not only political anarchism disappears in the abyss of war;
Moravagine's violence <I>against </I>women, which is his
violence against civilization and its origin, against all
that is feminine, is also eliminated and replaced by a
violence <I>for </I>women. The war is the battle of old men
fought by thousands of young, armed men. The old men seek to
reaffirm their origin and repossess their heritage; they
want to invade the city and possess the women. Anticipating
a war, D'Annunzio had set out the old metaphor clearly
enough: "Ah, I would have possessed you in the middle of the
massacre, on a bed of fire, under the wing of death. . . .
My will would have made my body perform miracles. . . . I
would have taken you."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
With less lucidity than
D'Annunzio, who simultaneously plays the role of the old and
the young man, the soldiers kill one another to win, without
really knowing what is to be won, only the old men know what
they want. Moravagine had tried to eliminate the stakes of
the game. Actually, as long as the story permits him to kill
women, the war cannot take place. Moravagine draws his
strength by postponing the war as the object of narration,
but his violence cannot eradicate the desire to possess. The
desire to appropriate the feminine lights up a global
conflict and snuffs out Moravagine, the anarchist become
idiot.

<p>
The war is a memory gap for the anarchist narration. But the
gap is not empty; it is the scene for a transfer of the
remains of anarchist power. When he is wounded during the
war Raymond awakens to his own madness and crosses over to
Moravagine's side. Through the loss of his leg, he is able
to forge a fraternal link with this stranger whose
monstrousness has been displaced. Raymond takes Moravagine's
place by becoming a regicide or an anarchist with the same
calmness and indifference as Moravagine. Before the war,
Raymond is only an observer; after it, he becomes active. In
1920, Cendrars had written of the war as a hiatus:

<p>
This emptiness, in which murders rage and massacre is
systematic, marks the transition from intellectual
Bolshevism to activist Bolshevism, or, in other words, the
transformation of Raymond into Moravagine. For Cendrars,
this would seem a promising transformation, and yet the war
remains inexpressible, or rather, unworthy of the language
of freedom. One might be tempted to say the same for
C&eacute;line. But whereas <I>Moravagine </I>takes place
primarily before the war, preparing it only to be suffocated
by it, <I>Voyage au bout de la nuit </I>unfolds after the
war and deploys a vengeful language to affirm the Mongol's
sorrowful victory. As Bardamu says, around a hundred pages
before the end of the novel: "In thinking now about all the
insane people whom I met at Baryton's, I cannot help but
believe that there are true realizations of our profound
temperaments other than war and death, the two infinite
nightmares."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
The war is a revolution in insanity for Cendrars, but it is
a confirmation for C&eacute;line. Cendrars embraces
modernity, whereas C&eacute;line sinks into disgust and ends
his novel with the words "let us speak about it no more"
("qu'on en parle plus") to signal a distress about the
narratibility of his story. For C&eacute;line, we know this
distress will only encourage more writing. Cendrars, by
constrast, enters many periods of silence as a writer,
starting with his silence about the war and the empty sleeve
he carried as its consequence. The silence of the hiatus is
far from empty--it displays full consciousness of the pain
that cannot be expressed. During the other great silence
that started for him in 1941, Cendrars wrote in a letter
that Hitler seemed to emerge directly from the character of
Moravagine (<I>JEM,</I> 143). Hitler, of course, incarnates
the inexpressible war, but as the double of the frightful
Mongol. Four years later, while he was waiting for the
proofs of <I>L'Homme foudroy&eacute;, </I>Cendrars bestowed
an eloquent wish upon his Mongol turned F&uuml;hrer; he
wrote: "I was happy about Mussolini's hanging. Who cares
about the other one? We should never write his name again"
(<I>JEM, </I>333).

<p>
The most notable fact of modernism is its "revolutionary"
style: abrupt
transitions, antinarrative structure, surprising
juxtapositions. Such
techniques depart from traditional "naturalistic" modes of
discourse and
communicate their all-important innovative relation to form.
In pre-World
War I France, many modernists--including Pablo Picasso,
Franti&szlig;ek
Kupka, Maurice Vlaminck, and Kees van Dongen--thought
anarchist politics
to be inherent in the idea of an artistic avant-garde and
created new
formal languages expressive of their desire to effect
revolutionary
changes in art and society.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Yet while Fauvism, Cubism, and
Orphism radically altered the art of this century, the
social-esthetic
theories that nurtured some of their most significant
manifestations were
discredited by the decline of the anarchist movement after
1914, the
rightward swing of political discourse during and after the
war, and the
concurrent advent of a resolutely apolitical formalist art
criticism. Thus
a "revolutionary esthetics"--a "politics of form"--played a
crucial role
in the development of modern art in prewar France, but its
significance
was first suppressed and then forgotten.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
To view the birth of modern art in this light fundamentally
changes the
received understanding of modernism in art-historical
discourse. Rather
than a small handful of ivory-tower artists fixed in a
(post-World War I)
canon that valorizes a few isolated careers, one sees a
broad field of
artists making artistic choices in response to the hot
realities of
cultural and political life. Picasso, for example, seeks a
unity of theme
and style expressive of his rejection of established art and
society in
much the same way as Kees van Dongen, and does so at the
same time--though
no "market," intellectual or otherwise, recognizes their
equivalence.
Rather than the current galaxy of modernist giants, fixed in
place by a
system privileging "high" painted abstraction and equally
high auction
prices, one sees an entirely different constellation of
res whose work
was valued at that complex time for offering a variety of
pictorial
solutions to the problems of expression and experience.
Th&eacute;ophile
Steinlen is a superb example of an artist whose work was
considered of
major importance to cultural critics in the period, but
whose very
allegiance to political themes, caricatural styles, and
allegorical and
narrative genres--all germane to his career as a
cartoonist--disqualifies
him as a significant modernist for the wilfully amnesiac
culture of
post-World War I. Rather than finding them subject to the
autocracy of oil
on canvas, one sees artists purposely working in other
media--particularly
satirical cartoons--with the aim of reaching a variety of
audiences for
specifically political purposes; an understanding of the
contemporary
issues that inspired these cartoons and influenced the
left-wing bohemia
of Paris before World War I will help to make sense of the
involvement of
modern artists with anarchist journals such as <I>L'Assiette
au beurre
</I>and <I>Les Temps nouveaux, </I>and the seriousness of
their engagement
with political issues of the day. Anarchism as a political
philosophy was
without question more influential on turn-of-the-century
artists than
socialism, in part because anarchist theory specifically
called for the
participation of artists in social transformation and in
part because
anarchism at one end of its spectrum stood for an absolute
individualism
fully compatible with a politicized bohemianism; socialism
played a
smaller, if still significant, role in prewar French
artistic
culture.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
In short, attending to the role of left-wing
politics, and specifically anarchism, in prewar Europe
presents a telling
corrective to myths about modernist art still in force.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Leftist politics characterized the art of prewar France much
more than is
usually realized. From large-scale salon paintings to
political cartoons
to avant-garde abstractions, artists preoccupied with social
criticism
sought appropriate mediums, styles, and audiences based on
their differing
conceptions of art's influence on society.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Whether they
employed "high" or "low" media and aimed at "high" or "low"
audiences
reflected conscious choices made in relation to a complex
field of
production and marketing. Socially-critical academic artists
such as Jules
Adler operated within the old salons, annually exhibiting
naturalist
paintings expressive of social concerns and addressed
largely to the class
in power, the bourgeoisie. Artists such as
Jules-F&eacute;lix Grandjouan
and Bernard Naudin abandoned painting altogether in favor of
political
satire in journals costing half a franc and addressed to
both the masses
and left-wing intellectuals. Others such as van Dongen and
Kupka divided
their time 

<B></B>

 between political cartooning
and an outrageous
avant-gardism
that would, according to anarchist theory, pave the way for
a new
consciousness and a new society even in its abandonment of
(and by) a
popular audience.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
During this unsettled period, one can see
artists responding to the dilemmas posed by such popularized
and
contradictory anarchist ideas: art should expose the follies
and
iniquities of the present social order, should be addressed
to the masses,
yet should be the untrammelled expression of the individual
and open the
path to a new social order.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Prewar artists found a shared
compass of concerns but differing solutions to the problems
posed by the
intersection of political commitment and artistic
self-expression.

<p>
That French culture was thoroughly politicized in the
<I>avant-guerre
</I>is strikingly evident in the polemical art
criticism--ranging from the
extreme right to the extreme left--on art in general and
modernism in
particular. Although historians of modernism are familiar
with the
relatively small body of criticism written by modernist
apologists, they
are largely unfamiliar with the broader range of art
criticism--much of it
hostile to modernism from various perspectives--that flooded
Paris in
these years and evoked the political issues troubling French
culture at
large.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
This criticism demonstrates, rather surprisingly,
that politically and artistically conservative critics
lauded academic
styles of art even when those styles served a thoroughly
anti-establishment theme--but that a wide range of critics
also and not
unexpectedly equated systematic departures from traditional
artistic
conventions with the anarchist attack on bourgeois society.
Though many
anarchists stood for highly nuanced theoretical positions,
fully
articulated in scores of anarchist journals, art critics
were much more
impressionistic and sweeping in their characterizations of
politically
inflected modernism. Cubism, especially, was seen as
"anarchist,"
"revolutionary," and "an attack on the social fabric,"
whether for good or
ill.

<p>
Yet leftist salon painting did not inspire such criticism.
It was not
socially critical subject matter that offended artistic
traditionalists so
much as modernist attacks on form itself, on all those
inherited
conventions still taught at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts
and
systematically repudiated by the modernists. Maurice Robin,
writing in the
radical socialist <I>Les Hommes du Jour </I>in 1909,
referred to Fauvism
and Cubism as "l'art ultra-r&eacute;volutionnaire."
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Henri
Guilbeaux, defending the neo-impressionists in the same
journal in 1911,
specifically accused Picasso of having produced "grotesque
results,
ridiculous, only made, it seems, in order to shock the
bourgeoisie."
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Coriol&egrave;s in the conservative <I>Le
Gaulois </I>characterized the avant-garde in 1910 as
manifesting "wilfully
revolutionary spirit, nay, anarchic tendencies."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
And
S&acirc;r P&eacute;ladan, by 1911 an extreme opponent of
modernism,
accused the new art of "anarchy . . . wishing to find a way
to proclaim
the immortal principles of 1889, in esthetics."
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
J. d'Aoust,
discussing Cubism and Futurism in 1912, asked, "In order to
be 'of one's
time' is it not necessary always to be a little
'revolutionary,' in art
principally?"
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Both right-wing newspapers like <I>Le
Correspondant </I>and left-wing journals like <I>Les Hommes
du jour
</I>aggressively guided their readers to respond politically
to the art of
this period.

<p>
The artists' varied responses to this deeply politicized
atmosphere--including topical cartoons, primitivism, and
avant-garde
art--involved yet another set of political 

<B></B>

 statements and
often purposely
provoked such critical reactions.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
I want to explore here the
ways in which this milieu nurtured a "political" art,
including an
avant-garde "politics of form." How style of any sort is
invested with
ideological meaning, though, is only visible in relation to
the larger
concerns of French culture in which, and against which,
modernism defined
itself.

<p>
The continuation of various realist styles in the official
salons--the
Salon des Artistes fran&ccedil;ais and the Salon National
des Beaux
Arts--served both an impressive escapism and the social
commentary of a
surprisingly large number of political artists.
Propagandistic work
appeared from 1900 to 1914 as it had in the previous
century, ranging in
category from allegory and genre to contemporary history.
These salons
offered a limited sample of Parisian political activity,
from reactionary
to parliamentary socialist, excluding any artist opposed to
the State or
its sanctioned institutions. Leftist artists who exhibited
in these salons
recognized the right of the State to control artistic
culture; though
their art frequently criticized government policy, their
politics
necessarily avoided the anarchist end of the spectrum,
ranging instead
from socialist to radical republican.

Jules Adler was a highly successful socialist artist, though
less well
known than his anarchist friend and rival Steinlen;
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<I>hors
concours </I>after 1898, he annually submitted large-scale
paintings to
the Salon des Artistes fran&ccedil;ais on themes of work.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
In
his monumental <I>La Gr&egrave;ve au Creusot </I>(Strike at
Le Creusot)(<a href="2.2leighten_1.html"> 1</a>),
exhibited in 1900--at a time when 51% of workers
made less than
the one franc a day necessary for subsistence
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
--the miners
rise up in protest against their working conditions and
wage-slavery. This
grandiose painting did much to cement Adler's reputation,
winning public
support for his depiction of the noble resolve of the
aggrieved workers.
The painting received lavish praise from Jules Rais in the
conservative
<I>Gazette des Beaux-Arts, </I>who exalted its

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
harmony of landscape and factory, of atmosphere and drama,
of individual
and crowd, of gesture and voice, of the contemporary and the
heroic. In a
resolved band, to the rhythm of songs of revolt, the miners
file past the
factory. Man is drawn up     opposite the
factory
smoke-stack; class organizes itself before the machine;
under the shadows
cast by the billowing smoke, the promise of the flags
reconquers the
sun.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
While summoning up the picture's drama, Rais neutralizes the
import of the
strike itself: by stating that "class organizes itself
before the machine"
he muffles the fact that the working class organizes in
opposition not to
"the machine" or the factory but to the bourgeoisie and the
factory owner.
He adds that the woman in the lead reminds him of
Delacroix's <I>Liberty
Leading the People, </I>painted following the abortive
revolution of 1830,
thus paying Adler's work a handsome compliment and placing
it firmly in
the tradition of French revolutionary painting with its
celebrations of
the struggle toward the Republic, now the status quo. Rather
than
acknowledging the threat of class war in Adler's celebration
of strike
action, Rais coopts the 

<B></B>

 painting to
republican tradition.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
He
concludes that Adler's work is "the synthesis of the most
complete art
that has been attempted here, in this poor last salon of
this anxious
century."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Henri Frantz, in his annual book reviewing the salons,
raises an "esthetic
problem" in order to doubt kindly whether Adler's work isn't
"un peu trop
r&eacute;aliste." His description of the painting, however,
is filled with
sympathy for its subject:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Against a somber horizon of black hills, of chimneys whose
ponderous smoke
darkens the atmosphere, a crowd of men and women advance
singing with
great banners unfurled. In the middle of all these black
garments, only
the flags contribute a little color. The general unity of
this picture
would be enough to document for us     all
the sadness of
this scene, to show us the anguish of hunger which can be
read on all the
faces contracted in exasperation.
</br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if the painter has perfectly
redeemed the
heroic side, dramatic in
fact in this scene, can we not ask ourselves if this
representation of the
worker completely accords with the plasticity of the whole
work of art,
and if the interpretation that M. Adler has given to it is
not a little
too realist[?]
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Though there is sympathy here for the workers' "anguish of
hunger," the
heroism of the theme is undermined by the unrelenting
depiction of its
motivating force in poverty. The painting's overabundance of
detail
departs from the codes of high art composition, which should
subsume such
misery in cathartic drama and "the plasticity of the whole."
What Frantz
found offensive was what Roland Barthes termed "the reality
effect," that
excess of descriptive detail that serves to lend all too
much in the way
of a realist imperative to the work's narrative, immersing
viewers in the
historical moment rather than providing them with the
necessary "aesthetic
distance" to admire the artist's compositional techniques.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
In sum the reality effect fabricates a "referential
illusion" that
challenges Frantz's own political position. 

<B></B>

 Adler has not
fulfilled the
viewer's presumed wish to transcend the gritty realities of
the scene,
though this "failure" is encoded in formalist critical
language. "Realism"
can also be a sign of political threat, though never as
serious a one as
the departure from convention in the direction of
avant-gardism.

Louis Roger's <I>l'Accident </I>of 1910
(

<Href=2.2leighten_2.html> 2</a>)
indicts
prevailing
conditions of labor by depicting the body of a man brought
up from the pit
of a construction site by his fellow workers.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
This was a
common occurrence, judging from the few relevant statistics
that survive
from this period: in 1911, for example, there were 3,900
work-related
injuries in Paris's 19th arrondissement alone.
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The
Christ-like posture of the limp re underscores the
victimization of
workers and suggests the artist's attitude toward labor
accidents; its
evocation of the realism of Caravaggio, with his plebian
models,
reinforces the christological allusion. Given the strong
social criticism
implied in such works as these, one might imagine that these
artists were
marginalized in the government-sanctioned world of the
salons and ignored
by critics other than doctrinaire leftists praising them for
their choice
of subjects. But this was not the case. Far from this
<I>gauchisme
</I>damaging Roger's reputation, it eventuated in a
commission for a mural
version of the painting in the Saint-Nazaire town hall. Such
official
recognition suggests that paintings like Roger's were not
offensive to the
salon committees as long as the style and composition of the
work gestured
sufficiently toward tradition.

History painting, especially scenes of revolution and the
Commune, also
formed a powerful vehicle for political messages. The
painter and
cartoonist Bernard Naudin looks back to the French
Revolution in such
works as <I>L'Engagement d'avant-garde; arm&eacute;e du Rhin
1792,
</I>shown in the Salon des Artistes fran&ccedil;ais in 1900,
and <I>Vive
la Nation!, </I>shown in 1904
(<a href=2.2leighten_3.html> 3</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
The compositional
structure of the latter work is based on the directional
force of an
explosion detonated by the central re, whose 

<B></B>

 energy
radiates outward
through the flags, bayonets, and other excited res. This
army
struggling against the forces of monarchy combines all the
laboring
classes of France, revealing white heads and greybeards
mingling with
enthusiastic youth. Interestingly, Naudin moves away from
the naturalism
of the majority of these salon works toward a more modernist
style, but
one that never breaks with readability, suggesting the
influence not only
of Manet's formal simplification and open brushwork, but
also of the works
then showing in the alternative salons--works by Henri de
Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard, and the young Henri
Matisse. Yet
Naudin's experience as a cartoonist constitutes the
strongest visual
influence on his treatment of the human re.

<p>
Naudin was an artist whose artistic decisions in many ways
proceeded from
political considerations, as the simple, energetic style of
this painting
demonstrates: highly accessible as narrative, yet "modern"
and folkish in
style, its spirited image celebrates revolutionary action.
Indeed, in 1904
he made a highly significant and telling decision: he
stopped painting
altogether, despite his initial success, in favor of a
career as a
political cartoonist and graphic artist.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
His subjects
shifted as well from revolutionary history--co&ouml;ptable,
as it was to
the republican tradition--to contemporary history and the
symptoms of
poverty.

<p>
<a name=4 href=2.2leighten_4.html>
<img align=right hspace=5 height=125

alt=IMAGE LINK></a>

Some of the stylistic features of <I>Vive la Nation!
</I>echo in Naudin
cartoons, such as "La F&ecirc;te du 14 Juillet &agrave;
Brazzaville" from
the anarchist <I>l'Assiette au beurre </I>of 1905
(<a href=2.2leighten_4.html>4</a>).
Naudin treated
the most inflammatory subjects in his cartoons, including
this dynamiting
of an African servant on Bastille Day by French government
administrators,
a scandal that powerfully agitated both colonialists and
anticolonialists
at the time.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
The simplified form, the expressive line, the
dynamic composition--even the repeating tricolor--suggest a
stylistic
dialogue between the two forms of Naudin's production.
Significantly, they
also share their political position: one is a celebration



 of
the ideal of
revolution, the other a damnation of Third Republic
parliamentarianism for
its hypocritical betrayal of the revolutionary ideals it
claimed to
uphold. Naudin's decision to abandon the arena of the
bourgeois salon in
order to devote himself to graphics and satire in the penny
weeklies
bespeaks a desire to reach a different audience--the working
class.

<p>
Anarchist and radical socialist artists frequently
manifested their
political allegiances by contributing works of art and art
criticism to
antiparliamentary journals like the radical socialist <I>La
Guerre
sociale, </I>the anarcho-syndicalist <I>La Voix du Peuple
</I>(the
official organ of the Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
du Travail [CGT]), or the anarcho-communist <I>Les Temps
nouveaux.
</I>Such journals also sponsored art exhibitions where
anarchists could
sell work on behalf of these journals and presumably reach a
sympathetic
audience and clientele directly. Of the left-leaning artists
exhibiting in
the official salons, Naudin is exceptional in his decision
to abandon not
only painting for cartooning, but the Salon des Artistes
fran&ccedil;ais
for the Salon des Ind&eacute;pendants and anarchist journals
such as
<I>L'Assiette au beurre, </I>where his drawings appeared
next to the work
of Steinlen, Jules-F&eacute;lix Grandjouan, van Dongen, and
numerous other
anarchist artists. Though Naudin's choice to abandon
painting was extreme,
the same questions of medium 

<B></B>

 and
intended audience arose for
a large range
of artists who in their different ways concerned themselves
with the
relations of politics and esthetics.
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Whereas Adler et al. showed in the official salons,
modernists avoided
such state-sanctioned venues, exhibiting instead in
independent salons and
private galleries. This political choice went hand-in-hand
with an
esthetic one: the pursuit of formal innovations unacceptable
within the
parameters of the Beaux Arts tradition and constituting an
affront to
critics such as Rais and Frantz. The range of eccentric
venues paralleled
choices of "high" versus "low" genre and medium. Thus the
political
cartoons of a number of prominent modernists provide an
unusual view into
the influence of questions of aim and audience on the
development of a
modernist idiom, and also into the various solutions,
"successful" or not,
proposed to the problems of production and reception faced
by anarchist
avant-gardism. The satirical graphics of modernist artists
have too often
been viewed as irrelevant to their "real" work and dismissed
either as
commercial expedients, or neutral drawings given a political
slant by
editorial captions. To push this work off to one side is in
effect to deny
the importance for these artists of the issues and passions
their cartoons
addressed. In fact, their political ideals were central to
their very
involvement with the satirical and anarchist journals, whose
editors
usually paid them very poorly, when they paid them at all.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Frequently the artists simply donated the drawings to the
journals.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
And those drawings were usually far from neutral:
emphatically political in imagery, their thrust was
unmistakable to the
artists' contemporaries, even without captions. Moreover,
the artists
often composed the captions themselves, assuring that their
intentions
were clearly expressed--a fact I discovered in examining
original drafts
for published cartoons, with captions in the artists' own
hands.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
The political motives of these works have been overlooked
for the same
reasons that the works themselves have been disregarded: the
mundane and
narrative preoccupations of the cartoons do not fit with
conceptions of a
commitment to "high" art, purely esthetic concerns, or
otherworldly
spirituality. The cartoons' lithographic medium is commonly
contrasted
with oil-on-canvas and the more "serious" emergence of
painterly
abstraction. The cartoons, however, exhibit the expressive
freedom, bold
simplification, violent deformation, and strikingly
nonliteral composition
associated with paintings by the same artists. Such
correspondences reveal
a strong formal relationship to the development of
modernism. More
significantly, the formal assault on the academic tradition
and the
political motivations of the cartoons register a deeply
adversarial
impulse common to both forms of production. The cartoons are
primarily
addressed to a plebeian audience, to the "people," eschewing
the venues in
place for bourgeois collectors.
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
When asked where he
exhibited his works, the cartoonist Jean-Louis Forain said
"in the
kiosks."
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Thus, though cartoons necessarily remain more
narrative than abstract, their posture is revealed elsewhere
than in their
explicitly political captions.

<p>
The polar distance between the "low" cartoon and the "high"
painted
abstraction covers a subtle and complex terrain, raising
questions long
considered problematic by 



 marxist
critics such as Theodor
Adorno, Georg
Luk&aacute;cs, Peter B&uuml;rger, and Thomas Crow, questions
of
fundamental importance for an understanding of the difficult
relationship
between art and politics for self-proclaimed leftist
avant-gardists before
World War I. How do artists, responding to a broadly
working-class (and
intellectual) liberationist movement, bring their left-wing
politics into
avant-garde "abstractions" that are addressed finally not to
the masses
but to a small circle of initiates? This central problem of
modernism
remained unresolved in the cultural ferment of the period,
in which art
could still seem to have the power (hence the obligation) to
liberate
consciousness and society. Its failure--along with the later
failure of
Surrealism--to do so has destroyed this particular form of
idealism within
late twentieth-century culture. But even during the
formative stages of
modernism, this nagging contradiction between political
realities and
abstract aesthetics, between demotic motives and elitist
products, forced
hypocrisy on any artist aspiring to both the "political" and
the
"avant-garde." At the same time, in a period of structural
change in the
art market, cartoons may have offered a way for artists to
shape their
d&eacute;class&eacute; artistic identities for a variety of
audiences and
with great freedom of invention.

<p>
The careers of Kees van Dongen and Juan Gris--each for a
time involved in
anarchist circles--reveal different paradigms of these
problems,
especially compared with that of Picasso, whose path avoided
the satirical
journals but was nonetheless politicized.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The satire of Gris
and van Dongen was addressed to a wide audience, from
workers to
intellectuals, and demanded a simplicity, readability, and
directness that
often resulted in highly inventive and extreme means of
expression. The
cartoons communicate contempt and indignation at the events
depicted, and
frequently register what appears to be heartfelt social
criticism. As even
the relatively d&eacute;gag&eacute; artist Jacques Villon
asserted,
recalling his own enormous production of satirical cartoons,
"At that time
the influence of the press on art was incontestable. It
helped to speed up
the liberation of painting from academicians."
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Cartoons
represented a powerful form of primitivism that could serve
to transform
artistic tradition.

<p>
Since <I>L'Assiette au beurre </I>was such a crossroads for
anarchism and
modernism, it is important to note that the journal did not
represent a
particular dogma but rather offered a great variety of
anarchist
approaches, from innocuous fun-making to savage criticism,
from fierce
individualism to outright fundraising for the CGT, sometimes
coming from
the same artist (for instance, Steinlen). The editors,
Samuel Schwarz
(1901-1903) and Andr&eacute; de Jonci&egrave;res (1904-12),
had many
friends among various anarchist groups, and doubtless hewed
to their own
political positions, but the attitudes expressed in the
cartoons were by
no means directed from above.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Both editors embarked on the
journal as a (not always successful) money-making scheme
rather than as a
vehicle for their own ideas, clearly defined or not; they
therefore gave
the artists a great deal of freedom and usually paid them
something,
though the artists certainly did not consider it well-paying
work.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
As Steinlen put it in 1903, "If <I>L'Assiette au
beurre </I>weren't the only periodical in which one can
express certain
things freely, we would all have abandoned it. By staying
on, we make a
sacrifice to Art and the [anarchist] Idea."
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
The weekly
magazine--which consisted 

<B></B>

 largely of
full-page cartoons--was
thus a
vehicle for a diverse group of leftist and <I>anarchisant
</I>writers and
artists whose opinions and outrage run through most of its
twelve years.

<p>
<I>Les Temps nouveaux, </I>on the other hand, was the
vehicle of its
editor, Jean Grave, an anarchist-communist who in 1885 had
taken over his
friend Peter Kropotkin's <I>La R&eacute;volte </I>and
subsequently
represented Kropotkinian anarchism in France.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Grave ran his
journal on a shoestring and frequently accepted subventions
for
publication from artists and writers including Camille
Pissarro, Kupka,
Pierre Quillard, A. F. H&eacute;rold, and Elis&eacute;e
Reclus.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Grave's policy was never to pay his contributors for
articles or drawings; thus everything that appeared in
<I>Les Temps
nouveaux </I>was a donation. It is telling that from 1905 to
1907, when
Grave succeeded in getting regular contributions of drawings
from his pool
of cartoonists, the journal increased significantly in
sales, then dropped
off as the artists fell away one by one.

<p>
Of the hundreds of artists publishing cartoons in Paris in
this period,
none were as inventive or expressive as van Dongen and Gris.
Kees van
Dongen made his first trip to Paris from Rotterdam in
1897-98, when he met
the influential critic F&eacute;lix F&eacute;n&eacute;on
through anarchist
contacts.
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
In 1900 he moved permanently to Paris, where he
became close friends with the most committedly anarchist of
the
neo-impressionists, Maximilien Luce and Paul Signac. In 1904
he befriended
Guillaume Apollinaire, Picasso, Maurice Vlaminck, and
Andr&eacute; Derain,
and in 1906 moved for a year to the Bateau-Lavoir, the
center of the
Picasso circle and a building so closely associated with
anarchists that
it was under police surveillance.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Here Picasso drew his
friend's portrait in his most outrageous Africanist style.
As a painter
passing through a wild neo-impressionism to a wilder
fauvism, van Dongen
was a declared anarchist and self-conscious "primitive," and
his
involvement with the anarchist press expressed his own
political
convictions. This involvement also helped him make needed
money at times,
although--as with all of these graphic artists--most of his
income came
from selling innocuous drawings to more purely "humoristic"
magazines like
<I>Le Frou-Frou, Le Rab'lais, Le Rire, </I>and<I>
L'Indiscret.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
For the anarchist and left-wing journals,
he consistently hammered on the vexed issues of bourgeois
society in the
Third Republic: poverty, prostitution, colonialism,
militarism.

<p>
Van Dongen's primary allegiance was to the anarchist
movement's advocacy
of sexual liberation. Dedicated male and female anarchists
mounted a
massive polemic on the subject of free love, entailing
attacks on the
commercialization of sexuality and support for legalized
abortion and the
abolition of state-sanctioned marriage (anarchists supported
gender
equality but not suffragism, since to vote was to support
the political
system already in place).
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
Van Dongen strongly believed in
<I>amour libre </I>and acted this out in both his art and
life. The
majority of his &#166;uvre, in his anarchist period and
later, is
preoccupied with celebrating sexuality in the guise of the
nude female
form.
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
His criticism of the social order appears in a special
issue on "The Prostituted Ones" for <I>L'Assiette au beurre
</I>of 26
October 1901. The series of drawings--with captions written
by the
artist--follows a young prostitute from her initial poverty
to her
inevitable death from syphilis, passing through a stage of

<B></B>

 momentary and
illusory well-being.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Elegantly dressed and brought by
carriage to the large department store "Au Printemps" after
a day of work,
"She ends by making 20 francs," the caption tells us, "which
she
spends."

Van Dongen condemned colonialism through attacks on
Christianity and its
missionaries. In a work of 1905 for <I>Les Temps nouveaux
</I>
(<a href=2.2leighten_5.html> 5</a>) he
simply and eloquently calls Christ "The 

<B></B>

White Peril"; with
idiot
complacency, the "Peril" stands possessively over cities,
factories,
armies, cannons, and ships sailing off to exploit exotic
lands. Christ is
here caricatured bluntly as a drunken, vainglorious fool who
takes a crazy
pleasure in the evil deeds perpetrated in his name. The
primitivism of the
drawing is brutal rather than spontaneous, and the message
could not be
clearer or more effective. Van Dongen goes further than any
other artist
of the period in his stark simplicity of line and form. At
the same time,
the setting is conceptual rather than naturalistic and
focuses attention
on the offensively blasphemous main re.

<p>
Other social problems occupied van Dongen as well. A cartoon
of 20 June
1901 for <I>L'Assiette </I>depicts a ragged and bony street
musician who
confesses, "I'm not a musician or a singer. . . . I'm
starving!" The
caption-- "J'suis ni musicien, ni chanteur . . . je suis
cr&egrave;ve-faim!"--is written in the <I>argot </I>of Emile
Pouget's
popular anarchist journal, <I>Le P&egrave;re Peinard,
</I>eliding the
vowels to approximate underworld and street slang. The crude
pictorial
form, the <I>argotique </I>caption, and the political
message are all of a
piece, communicating an identification with the
<I>lumpenproletariat,
</I>the marginal, the starving, and the unemployed--those
who inhabited
the peculiar province of the anarchists.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Van Dongen's thick
black strokes of ink evoke precisely that aspect of his
later painting
that offended his critics and pleased his admirers. The
anarchist politics
of his cartoons and the style he developed to serve them are
continuous
with his "audacious and violent" "high" art, exhibited in
the Salon des
Ind&eacute;pendants and the Salon d'Automne annually
beginning in
1904.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

In his preface to van Dongen's first one-person show at the
Galerie
Vollard in November 1904, F&eacute;n&eacute;on sets the tone
for much of
the criticism of van Dongen, describing such works as
<I>Zandstraat
</I> as "restor[ing] the teeming appearance of the
poor and heated
streets of Rotterdam, the convulsive agitation of industries
and the girls
of Roode Zand and of Zandstraat struggling with the
sailors"; he alludes
also to the artist's "violently" coloring some of the
drawings, thus
allying the traditional anarchist theme of street life with
its "violence"
of treatment.
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
But works like this do not come close to the
primitivism evident in his later cartoons and Fauve
paintings. The
<I>Femme fatale </I>of 1905
(<a href=2.2leighten_6.html> 6</a>)
exhibits stark
contrasts and
amorphous shadows thoroughly comparable to those in his
cartoons, with the
addition of arbitrary and appallingly garish color. In the
preface for van
Dongen's exhibition at Bernheim-Jeune (where
F&eacute;n&eacute;on was in
charge) in 1908, Marius-Ary Leblond--actually a pair of
brothers who wrote
novels set in colonial Africa--celebrated the artist's
palette as
expressive of a new modernist primitivism, describing "green
acidities,
reds of blood-colored mandarin, phosphorous yellows, winey
lilacs,
electric blues"; connecting this "primitivist" sensibility
with the cults
of African and child art, they call the res of such
women "European
idols," while van Dongen's clowns manage to "achieve human
expressions in
their wooden-doll faces."
 <sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

<p>
The offensiveness of such works--fauve in style and, as in
Matisse, all
the more offensive by virtue of their uses of the human
re--resides
not only in the repetition of marginal subjects like the
prostitute
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
and the poor circus re but in the ever more
cartoon-like treatment of such subjects. In <I>Femme fatale
</I>the
garishly 

<B></B>

 made-up woman joylessly
advertises her breast,
displaying the
jewels and feathers that are the fruits of her labors. One
of the
jewels--a gold heart--lies above her breasts, rendering
supremely ironic
the "love" she offers. Both this painting's subject and its
style were an
affront to bourgeois morality; the buyer of the prostitute
is presumably
as corrupt as she, and sex for both is merely a form of
commercial
exchange. The style of the work counteracts the expected
sexual allure of
the prostitute in its departure from naturalism, emphasizing
the
"unnatural": acid colors, primitivized form, and lack of
spatial
structure. The unnaturalness of sex for sale is manifested
in the
prostitute's exaggerated lack of passion and interest in the
client/viewer; in both van Dongen's cartoons and his
paintings there is a
corresponding awareness that such women begin and end in
poverty. Through
his combination of subject and style, van Dongen finds a
visual equivalent
to an anarchist rhetoric that encouraged sensitivity to the
plight of
those on the social margin, a rhetoric in which artistic
daring paralleled
propaganda. Van Dongen's political cartoons themselves
suggest the formal
means for transforming painting into a weapon of
avant-gardism. 

<B></B>

<p>
Juan Gris has always been treated as a completely apolitical
artist whose
few cartoons supposedly represent the best instance of
"radicalization" by
editors.
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
Yet Gris expressed pacifist convictions throughout
his life; though probably never anarchist himself, he was
sympathetic to
that cause at least in the prewar period. The memoirs of
friends like
Alice Halicka and Waldemar George speak of an early
"revolutionary" Gris.
According to Halicka--Louis Marcoussis's wife and a friend
of Gris--he was
very concerned with social injustice, and "like his comrades
[she names
van Dongen, Villon, Vallotton, Kupka, and Marcoussis], hate
for society
pushed this young rebel to substitute for vitriol and
dynamite the acid of
his drawings and the violence of his captions." In an
interestingly
anarchist correlation of avant-gardism and revolutionary
"propaganda of
the deed," Halicka asserts that, after joining the Cubist
movement, "he
quickly took a place in the highest rank serving in this way
art and
revolution at the same time."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Gris, like his fellow
countryman Picasso, avoided military service and, since he
did not pay the
exemption fee, was officially a fugitive and could not
return to
Spain.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
George called Gris "this atheist, this revolutionary,
this defaulter from the Spanish army."
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
When World War I broke
out in August 1914, Gris wrote to his dealer D.-H.
Kahnweiler that the war
"does not concern me either by virtue of my nationality,
character, or
ideas."
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
Gris came into contact with anarchism and socialism
by virtue of his antimilitarism and anticlericalism;
additionally he
collaborated with anarchist writers such as Charles Malato
for
<I>L'Assiette au beurre.</I>

<p>
In 1906 Gris moved to the Bateau-Lavoir at the height of its
reputation as
an anarchist hangout, and in 1908 was eating at Picasso's
every day,
according to a letter that Gris wrote to a friend in Spain.
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
While his closeness to Picasso's circle alone would prove
little about the
influence of revolutionary rhetoric on Gris, his political
cartoons
testify to the importance of his brief involvement with the
movement.
Gris's cartoons are extraordinarily inventive in their
formal means, and
were for Gris, as for van Dongen, an arena for
experimentation that
affected his subsequent painting. Again, as with van
Dongen's, the
political meanings of many of Gris's cartoons are
independent of their
captions; in any case numerous drawings for Gris's cartoons
include
manuscript captions in his own hand.
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Gris's political <I>engagement </I>is clear in a special
issue of
<I>L'Assiette au beurre </I>of 29 August 1908--entitled
"Turkey
Regenerated"--on which he collaborated with Malato and the
artist
d'Ostoya. More than merely criticizing Turkey, Gris uses
this opportunity
to devastating effect, representing a nation considered in
France to be
the epitome of ignorance, despotism, and backwardness as
sponsoring what
were in fact French policies, currently under bitter debate
in Paris. This
series constitutes a paradigmatic example of the anarchist
technique of
satire by inversion: Turkey is described in glowing
schoolbook terms,
belied in each case by the action depicted. One cartoon
shows a schoolroom
scene with the innocuous-sounding caption, "Instruction will
be free
[i.e., without cost] and obligatory. Children will be taught
respect for
the law and the glorious deeds of our ancestors." The
"glorious deed,"
however, is a beheading; the children look on in dismay. The
drawing is
crude, with the back wall parallel to the picture plane;
cut-off forms
lock the podium into place, 

<B></B>

 while the
blackboard appears as
the only
diagonal shape and the only suggested movement in an
otherwise
relentlessly static, nearly geometrical, construction
expressive of the
oppressive Ottoman state. Yet August 1908 was the midpoint
of a heated
five-month debate in the Chamber of Deputies over capital
punishment, so
that Gris in criticizing Turkey is even more pointedly

<B></B>

 criticizing France
and the supporters of the guillotine, taking the
abolitionist position on
the issue (France finally abolished capital punishment in
1981). In
numerous ways, the drawing pushes expression to new limits,
as Gris
flattens space, geometrizes form, and treats res with
the utmost
simplification.

<p>
<a name=7 href=2.2leighten_7.html>
<img align=right hspace=5 height=125
src=thumb/2.2leighten_7t.gif
alt=IMAGE LINK></a>

He carries this stylistic radicalism as far as he would ever
do in the
most powerful drawing in this special issue
(<a href=2.2leighten_7.html> 7</a>), a
cartoon posing as
a comment on Turkey's imperialist ambitions in Africa. Since
at least the
Greek War of Independence of the 1820s, the French
considered the Turks
the most ruthless of peoples, and the Turks are here shown
bayoneting the
African babies they would pretend to rule. But the Turks
never invaded
subsaharan Africa; the French did. Gris is evoking details
of the scandals
of 1905-1906 over the documented behavior of French
officials and army in
the Congo. Dressing French colonial soldiers in Turkish
uniforms, he
criticizes 

<B></B>

 the French government in the
severest terms. One
hardly needs
the caption to send the message home: "Guided by a need for
expansion
proper to every civilized nation, the Turks will go into the
savage lands
to bring civilized ways." Gris parodies the foundation of
French colonial
philosophy with its "civilizing mission" and turns the trope
of the
primitive back on the complacent French. This is possibly
the starkest
cartoon published in Paris in the prewar period. And Gris
specifically
relies on formal devices that he will use in developing his
cubism in the
following years. No modulation of form or recession of space
allows the
viewer to escape the linear gestures of the machinelike
soldiers as they
intersect lethally with the soft, floppy forms of the black
children. The
death's-head faces are reduced to a grim simplicity,
especially the
prominent one in the upper center.

<p>
Such cartoons demonstrate that Gris was absorbing
protocubist lessons from
Picasso's work in 1908, though this is not evident in his
"high" art until
two years later. But important elements of Gris's mature
style are already
in place: flatness, planarity, linearity, geometrification,
repetition of
lines, extreme contrast, and a complementarity of
abstraction and realism.
All are developed in the laboratory of political satire, and
all continue
in his painting. Gris's graphics of 1908, with their radical
primitivism
and restriction of recessive space, contrast interestingly
with the few
surviving drawings and paintings before 1911, more realist
in approach if
still subtly geometrizing. Clearly Gris felt a difference in
subject and
aim between his cartoons and such works; and just as clearly
the cartoons
represented for him a more "advanced" mode of stylistic
experimentation.

<p>

<img align=right hspace=5 height=125
src=thumb/2.2leighten_8t.gif
alt=IMAGE LINK></a>

For the next few years Gris studied the work of various
cubists--especially Picasso and Georges Braque--at a slight
historical
remove, carefully developing the elements that interested
him into his own
style and drawing frequently on his arsenal of cartoon
techniques. By 1912
Gris had evolved a unique combination of abstraction and
realism, as in
<I>The Washstand </I>
(<a href=2.2leighten_8.html> 8</a>),
where he creates an abstract
work through
the use of parallel lines that impose a grid over quite
recognizable
objects: the washbasin and water jug, the bottles of cologne
and comb, an
actual mirror. One peeks through the obfuscating vertical
and horizontal
lines and translucent planes at undistorted mundane objects
illustrated
with a cartoonist's clarity. And he did not forget the power
of the
silhouette, as is evident in <I>re in a Caf&eacute;
</I>of 1914 (<a href=2.2leighten_9.html> 9</a>),
with his hat and turned-up coat collar, reading <I>Le
Matin. </I>Such
tricks of juxtaposition--cubist geometrification (and
obfuscation) and
cartoon illustration--developed out of Gris's unique graphic
style,
invented for both visual and political punch; highly
effective in his
cartoons, these cartoon "tricks" constitute one of the key
differences
between his cubism and that of Picasso and Braque.

<p>
As in van Dongen's work, there is a significant continuity
between Gris's
cartoon style and his abstract paintings. Unlike van Dongen,
whose
painting developed simultaneously with his cartoons and
continued to
reflect his anarchist ideals and attitudes to at least 1909,
Gris has
self-consciously drained his paintings of political import,
avoiding such
anarchist subjects as prostitutes--frequent enough in his
cartoons--and
neutralizing his radical style. Gris's cartoon images of
politically
charged public 

<B></B>

 events thus contrast
tellingly with his
frequent
oil-on-canvas images of domestic interiors and privatized
environments:
kitchen still-lives, washstands, and views out of Gris's own
window, as in
<I>Still Life before an Open Window: Place Ravignan
</I>.

<p>
How then does Gris's modernism differ from Picasso's? For
according to the
anarchist rhetoric of the day--and a wide range of indignant
art
criticism--both might be deemed leftist by virtue 

<B></B>

 of their
innovative
styles. In his <I>Demoiselles d'Avignon </I>of 1907, for
example, Picasso
has taken a traditional genre, the academic nude, and not
only placed it
in the socially concrete arena of the brothel but conflated
it with freely
interpreted references to African masks, some of whose
associations for
the French we can glimpse in Gris's cartoon. Picasso
consistently and
purposely inverts subjects and themes of the academic and
classical
tradition, which gives his art an extra power to offend: not
only the
nude, but the Madonna and Child, the landscape, the
portrait, even the
<I>spinario, </I>the famous Hellenistic statue of a boy
removing a thorn
from his foot, rendered--with the gender reversed--in his
most
anticlassical, primitivizing style. Picasso's modernism is
thus in a
necessary dialogue with the classical tradition.

<p>
Gris, on the other hand, sought out themes of modern life
and was proud
(even if he was incorrect in thinking so) to have been the
first to
introduce a siphon into modern art, as in <I>Siphon and
Bottles
</I>.
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
Siphons, watches, mirrored washstands: Gris's
subjects are the toys of a modern world, and his celebration
of them is in
tune with the flagrant modernity of his cubist style. Thus
style and
content in Gris's work operate not in a relation of tension
or
contradiction, but of resolution. As Apollinaire wrote in
<I>Les peintres
cubistes, </I>"Here is the man who has meditated on
everything that is
modern."
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
Of course, Gris never entirely abandoned his
socially critical position. Despite the awkwardness of his
presence in
Paris during the war, he quietly maintained his pacifist
views, writing
with mock naivet&eacute; to his friend Maurice Raynal in
1916, "I can't
understand as you do this urge to massacre, to exterminate."
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
But he just as surely developed a carefully privatistic art
that left his
brief involvement with the anarchists behind. This operation
is perhaps
nowhere as visible as in his collages.

<p>
<a name=0 href=2.2leighten_0.html>
<img align=right hspace=5 height=125
src=thumb/2.2leighten_0t.gif
alt=IMAGE LINK></a>

Picasso had a long history of involvement with the anarchist
movement, and
manipulated the subjects and styles of his art to achieve
political
effects in the collages of 1912-13.
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
Given the fact that this
politicized version of collage was the one that Gris
inherited when he
began to concentrate on <I>papiers-coll&eacute;s </I>in the
summer and
fall of 1914, on the eve of war, a comparison of his
<I>re in a
Caf&eacute; </I>with a work like Picasso's <I>Bottle of Suze
</I>of 1912
(<a href=2.2leighten_0.html> 10</a>)
is revealing. Picasso's collage, also representing
a caf&eacute;
still-life with bottle, glass, and newspaper on a table,
imports the
gruesome facts of the Balkan War as well as the huge
anarchist and
socialist peace movement gathering force in Paris. By
juxtaposing articles
from <I>Le Journal </I>on these subjects in the collage,
Picasso evokes
the topic of debate around a caf&eacute; table while
subverting the
commodified layout of newsprint common to the
mass-distribution dailies he
drew on. The political implications of a column reporting a
pacifist rally
are thus diffused by its submersion in a patchwork of
neutralizing
information, from the sensationalist to the trivial to the
commercial.
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
By retrieving columns from different parts of
the newspaper, Picasso reunites reports that now echo
meaningfully. This
reorganization constitutes a counterdiscourse, disrupting
the original
ideological formation of the newsprint; it does so
furthermore in the
setting of a caf&eacute;, that locus of friendship,
argument, sedition,
and police surveillance that "sustained the political,
cultural and social
ferment of <I>fin-de-si&egrave;cle </I>and <I>belle
&eacute;poque
</I>Paris."
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
Thus 

<B></B>

 the deliberation of their
approaches to
collage reveals Gris's careful avoidance of the political in
contrast to
Picasso's purposeful deployment of anarchist themes--war,
pacifism,
armaments profiteering, strike-breaking--at a moment of
international
crisis. By summoning the theme of state-sponsored militarism
into the
collage, Picasso invokes contemporary anarchist debate even
as he destroys
officially sanctioned artistic conventions in the work
itself. Through his
manipulation of current events in his collages, 

<B></B>

 he
establishes his own
relations to the views of pacifists, socialists, and
anarchists opposed to
the impending war, thus placing himself in a collectivist
context, a
public--that is, political--space.
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

Gris's collage is also a caf&eacute; scene: a re sits at
a table
drinking a beer and reading the news. Here, however, the
"news" is not an
intrusion from the outer political world, but a carefully
selected
fragment pasted just under the masthead that plays on the
concept of
illusion versus reality so wittily juggled in the work
itself, with its
industrial artificial woodgrain paper--both "real" and
carefully
faked--and its literal newsprint: the headline reads, "There
will be no
more faking of works of art." Gris pasted a headline in
<I>The Table
</I>of 1914 (<a href=2.2leighten_1.html> 11</a>)
 announcing "le vrai et le faux [the
true and the
false]," which accomplishes the same witty act of artistic
self-reference.
Truth and falsity are invoked in a profoundly playful image
in which
texture as a property has become completely independent of
the objects
depicted: the woodgrain representing the texture and
material of the table
floats away from the table's structure, its cut shape used
instead to
describe the transparent glass and bottle; at the same time
a cartoon key
opens the drawer of the wooden table, which the absence of
woodgrain has
left starkly and absurdly white. Gris plays here with
"truth" and
"falsity" on several levels: all art is illusion, even when
it abandons
traditional three-dimensional illusionism as a way of trying
to arrive at
a deeper truth. In a collage such as <I>Guitar, Sheet-Music
and Wineglass
</I>of 1912
(<a href=2.2leighten_2.html> 12</a>),
Picasso likewise invites
interpretation on
questions of artistic syntax, with his allusions to varying
modes of
visual discourse (a thoroughly conceptual guitar juxtaposed
to a drawing
of a glass in his earlier cubist style, still based on
visual perception);
this collage plays too with an analogy between the
abstraction of music
and that of the work itself. Thus the "battle" announced in
the headline
at the bottom may metaphorically evoke artistic games
comparable to
Gris's. But in Picasso's collage the "battle" also
inescapably refers to
war. All the beauty, wit, and sheer subversiveness of the
work is forced
to coexist with the concrete reality of the newsprint's
literal reference
to the first Balkan War.

<p>
In the <I>Musician's Table </I>of 1914, Gris plays
brilliantly with
illusionism and abstraction, utilizing to the full his
cartoonlike
illustrational style to contrast with the cubist elements.
This time his
little headline informs us that "Explorers in disaccord
accuse each other
of having explored nothing." The metaphorical comment on his
(so far)
friendly rivalry with Picasso and other artists again refers
inwardly to
the creative process and to an esthetic dialogue among a
small group of
like-minded individuals, carefully defusing the explosive
political
potential Picasso manipulates so cleverly. Indeed, in
<I>Breakfast
</I>, Gris playfully wins this artistic contest by
pasting his own
name over the headline in <I>Le Journal</I>'s morning news,
read over the
breakfast table in the privacy of his own home. Even when
Gris
occasionally does paste in newspaper references to political
controversies, such as the debate over the three-year draft
that appeared
in three works of 1914 including <I>Bottle of Rum and
Newspaper,</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
the allusion is barely legible, muffled
rather than amplified, private rather than public. That Gris
knew
perfectly well the potential of such newsprint allusions is
subtly visible
in numerous works produced during the war--for example,

<B></B>

 in
the carefully
painted-in headline, "Official Communiqu&eacute;s," on a
fictional
newspaper in <I>Still Life with Checked Tablecloth
</I>. This at a
time when he could write to Maurice Raynal, "I don't even
like reading the
newspapers because I am so impressed and terrified by what
is
happening."
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
Spanish pacifism dies hard. Nearly alone of the avant-garde,
Picasso and
Gris stood by their refusal to serve in any military,

<B></B>

 stood
against the
forces that led Apollinaire, Mo&iuml;se Kisling, Marcoussis,
and so many
others also from neutral countries to t in the war.
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
When
Gris used a masthead like <I>The Socialist, </I>as in <I>The
Sun-blind
</I>,
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
he conjured up the official pacifist position of
the Socialist Party before the war. And it is hard not to
see Gris, in a
work like <I>Fruit Dish, Glass, and Lemon (Still-Life with
Newspaper)
</I>, commenting on his own immovable pacifism in this
gloomy gray
painting, its one 

<B></B>

 bright, bitter spot
of citron intersecting
with the
lighted masthead of the newspaper, <I>The Intransigent.
</I>But this is a
quiet sort of comment if it is one, perfectly in tune with
the private,
inwardly-turned world of Gris's cubist art, never parading
the grand
public themes of the Puteaux cubists or playing on the world
stage of
public events evoked by Picasso at an earlier, safer time.

<p>
The distance that Gris traveled from his cartoons to his
paintings is an
index of his political evolution, and charts a very
different trajectory
from Naudin, Kupka, van Dongen, or Picasso. When it comes to
politics and
the avant-garde, style and content are symbiotic; they
cannot be
disjoined. Gris's &#166;uvre demonstrates that style alone
cannot bear
revolutionary weight when all the objects that that style
attempts to
transform begin to resist it. Gris is then an interesting
example of an
artist whose leftist politics, inspiring the expressive
power of his
cartoons, nourished his subsequent painting, but who wanted
to rid his
avant-garde art of those uncontrollable politics at a time
when they were
most intensely unacceptable. At the same time it is
important to remember
that for critics hostile to modernism the privatism and
seemingly
innocuous content of Gris's still-lives would not
necessarily mitigate the
charged import of the works' style; Gris kept a very low
profile during
the war, when cubism was popularly viewed as
<I>b&ocirc;che.</I>

<p>
Choices of artistic venue, style, and content available to
politicized
artists in the period before World War I were myriad. There
were numerous
models provided by successful salon painters, political
cartoonists, and
radical modernists (if only by virtue of their
<I>succ&egrave;s de
scandales</I>). Even more significantly, art criticism,
which flourished
in more than 250 journals available in Paris between 1881
and 1914,
articulated a wide range of often politicized esthetic
positions.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
The question of how one was likely to be received
in various quarters could be grasped in advance, and thus
needs to be part
of any consideration of how artists in this period fashioned
their
careers, addressed their audiences, and accordingly chose
their mediums,
genres, styles, and venues. For historians of modernism, it
should be
clearer now that avant-gardists made their choices too
within this
cultural discourse. Whether politically left- or right-wing,
whether
hostile to or supportive of modernism, art critics
frequently viewed the
art of the prewar period as demonstrating a political
attitude toward the
status quo by virtue of style alone. But readings of this
sort occurred on
the most superficial level; those critics who were more
engaged and
informed invariably addressed both style and content in
their evaluation
of a given artist. Quite obviously, politicized style was
not the intent
of all modernists (one thinks immediately of right-wing
modernists such as
Roger de la Fresnaye); and one cannot assume even from an
extreme
radicalism of form a political posture (compare the pure
abstraction of
the anarchist Kupka with its visual counterpart in the work
of the
thoroughly bourgeois and "apolitical" Robert Delaunay). But
one does
discover that artists who saw themselves as anarchists could
self-consciously play with and against the expectation of
radicalism--an
expression that they shared with their critics. The artists'
various
responses to their deeply politicized culture--including
satire,
primitivism, and other examples of socially critical,
"liberated," and
"destructive" art--produced a

 politics
of form, whose
motives played an
important role for such artists in encouraging the
counterdiscourse of
modernism.

and
Work, </I>trans. Douglas Cooper, rev. ed. (New York: Abrams,
1969), 15-16,
treats the cartoons as superlatively unimportant, mentioning
them only in
the context of how Gris made a living in Paris from 1906 to
1910. More
recently Mark Rosenthal, <I>Juan Gris </I>(Berkeley:
University of
California Art Museum and Abbeville Press, 1983), has
expressed the same
view of this body of work, though--following John Richardson
in the
foreword to <I>Juan Gris </I>(Dortmund: Museum am Ostwall,
1965)--he
offers an astute appreciation of some of the cartoons'
formal effects as
"signals" of his later work: "powerful juxtapositions of
shapes,
foreground-background reversals, patterning, and visual
rhyming" as well
as "prominent wall patterns, mirrors, doors, and windows"
. As is
usual in discussions of Gris's work, none of the cartoons
Rosenthal
reproduces express political criticism in the drawing
itself, and only one
caption--of the sort that it has been easy to assume was
composed by an
editor--addresses a political subject; "Bruits de guerre et
bruits de
paix," from <I>L'Assiette au beurre </I>(3 October 1908),
439, depicts two
men talking in a caf&eacute;: "--There was a time, young
man, when I was a
pacifist. But with age I've realized that our country's
honor must be
defended. --With my blood? --Well not with mine, by Jove."

Marilyn McCully and Robert Rosenblum have likewise noted the
relationship
between Gris's cartoons and his later paintings, though
again looking only
at the formal echoes between them; see McCully, "Los

observation and rightly
insists on Gris's political engagement; but he argues that
to the extent
that cubist elements appear in Gris's cartoons, their
expressive power as
cartoons diminishes (Shikes, "Five Artists in the Service of

<p>
If an age in which anarchism red seriously within
Western discussions of revolution and political philosophy
died at the close of World War I, anarchy did not remain
buried. Both an earlier conspiratorial-libertarian breed of
anarchism, and later anarcho-syndicalist proposals for
loosely confederated workers' organizations were resurrected
in Spain, and later by a New Left disenchanted with the
claims of liberal democracy and state communism. Moreover,
the spectral re of the anarchist was to continue to
haunt the modernist imagination. Both state socialism and
liberal democracy (and later fascism) were compelled to
excise the inchoate, lawless impulses hidden within their
own theoretical premises. What, then, becomes of these
impulses? I will argue that they found uneasy sanctuary in
an emerging modernist fiction, whose very techniques can be
understood as both an evasion and an accommodation of a
political violence that "history" has refused to shelter.
Just as slogans, which Alice Yaeger Kaplan calls the
"lifeline between writing and politics," have indicated the
linguistic cruxes over which labor has fought its battles,
so too will the crisis of violence mark a defining set of
moments in the emergence of the modernist
aesthetic.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Most modern writers were only able
to portray anarchist rebellion as at best wrongheaded or
doomed, as in Thomas Hardy, or at worst drunken, mindless,
catastrophic, and satanic. Nonetheless, a 



 certain quality of
demonic rowdiness infiltrates modern texts, even where
technique becomes the supreme agent of a textual
will-to-power intent on regulating semantic anarchy.
Modernist fiction continues to rehearse and redefine the
battles of a mythic anarchist violence.

<p>
Clearly the complex evolution of collective fantasies of
violence is as important to cultural historians as to
sociologists and political historians; the construction of
these fantasies may provide insight into the strange set of
texts that have come to be identified as examples of
literary modernism. What is today too quickly dismissed as
an "elite" or autonomous modernism was in fact, over time,
deeply engaged with popular cultures and political issues,
and thus can be viewed neither as an evasion of worldly
concerns nor a retreat into autonomy. I contend that the
aesthetic itself prophesies potential routes for the desires
of the masses, and that anarchic violence marks the
boundaries of the contested terrain of the modern
imagination. The bomb-throwing anarchist functions
simultaneously as the unspeakable object of dread in early
modernist and premodernist fiction, and as a reservoir for
extreme and unrealizable social aspirations. This duality
creates one of the underlying dialectics of modernist
aesthetics.

<p>
The political violence represented in the re of the
anarchist is perpetually elusive and evanescent, eluding any
"molar" conration by which it might be packaged,
contained, and defused. Even preventative measures and well
intentioned attempts to come to terms with violence will
always be a step behind, so to speak, condemned to follow in
the bloodied footsteps of the act itself. For, as Elaine
Scarry argues, violence is metaphysically distinct from
language in both its production and its
reception.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
It cannot be grasped; it is by
definition excessive. Language, however violent, falls
short.

<p>
When I insist on the elusiveness of violence I do not mean
to reduce it to a textual operation, nor do I intend to
dismiss its omnipresent reality on the battlefields, in the
streets, in schools and homes. Yet specific forms of
textuality may be highly calibrated mechanisms for
containing, appropriating, confronting, or evading a
political violence understood as other. While violence bears
out the significance of any operation usually perceived as
textual, that same violence will always be situated as
extratextual. As Gilles Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari
argue, the violence of language itself insists that
extralinguistic forces overdetermine
utterance.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
If, in some mad dream of a director, violence were
consummated "onstage" in all its indeterminate glory, it
would presumably provoke a powerfully antisocial response in
its audience. Such a theory underlies both the radical
imagination that would insist on direct political action and
the censorial imagination moved by the dread of mobs rioting
at, for instance, contemporary black motion pictures. For
the former, it seems the audience must be "moved" beyond
outrage or pity to action. Violence transforms the project
of offending an audience--a relatively simple task, after
all--into a full-fledged attack on social structures. Were
critique ever to become truly ruthless in its response, and
aimed at everything that exists, as Marx wished, it would
pass over into wide-scale demolition. Censorship itself
confirms the 

<B></B>

 idea that any audience may
be mobilized into
pandemonium. Obviously racist, sexist, and other biases that
have long equated the "other" with the "irrational" can come
into play in various ways. A fully ethical struggle emerges
out of the drama enacted over the control of scapegoats, and
the question of whether the scapegoats will be numerous
enough for self-determination. It is enough for now to
underscore the way in which "violence" is understood to
clarify and illuminate the compelling and manichean forces
at work upon consciousness, forcing it to choose between the
real urgencies of the moment. For even as violence inspires
rebellion and breaks down the hypothetical barriers to
disorder, its unveiling manifests, too, a desire for
rigorous and absolute clarity.

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<!--_a-head-->
Georges Sorel and the Possibilities of Anarchism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Just as something called "anarchy" is invoked to rationalize
the most draconian forms of state repression, so too the
traditions of anarchism present the most uncompromising
meditation on the revelatory possibilities of political
violence. The anarcho-syndicalist tradition, exemplified
particularly in Sorel but also in writers such as Mikhail
Aleksandrovich Bakunin, Petr Alekseevich Kropotkin, and Emma
Goldman, demonstrates the ambiguous position of the
anarchist in the popular imagination. Conservatives like
Fyodor Dostoevski and Joseph Conrad characterized the
anarchist as motivated by <I>ressentiment, </I>though this
is not invariably the case (as both of those writers
instinctively grasped). What Walter Benjamin termed a "quite
childish" anarchism relied on a variety of now dated
presumptions and theories: Rousseauesque ideas of the state
of nature, social Darwinism, heroic voluntarism, sentimental
altruism, and so forth.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Nonetheless,
anarchist
theory struggled to expand the limits of progressive
thought: Kropotkin revised Darwinist thought to include the
concept of mutual aid; Goldman was one of the strongest
debunkers of eugenics, as well as an early champion of
sexual freedom. Most strikingly, anarchism in its invocation
of a better world resisted the compulsion of
self-legitimation. Violence in anarchist thought expressed
something more than a mere temperamental or pathological
dissatisfaction with things; even as an abstract fantasy, it
became that which dramatized the very limits of morality and
rational thought,
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
abandoning instrumental
rationality in favor of spectacle and the sensational
apocalypse.

<p>
I want to stress here the uncompromising will to distortion
in the anarchist tradition, its insistence that arguments
based on means and ends take us nowhere; indeed, for the
anarchist, this "us" is precisely exclusionary, for the
moral calculus of gains and losses cannot be considered in
the abstract. Calculation--debate--already defines the
circulation of power and "reasonable" arguments are always
spoken from the position of power; in their utterance they
express their own power, insisting on a humanist distinction
between violence and speech. While it may be metaphysically
impossible to find an alternative to that distinction--one
upon which every democratic social contract indeed rests--we
should admit that similar arguments are senseless to those
who live and work under the stick. 

<B></B>

<p>
Consequently, Georges Sorel's <I>Reflections on Violence
</I>is characterized by the burning desire to clarify, once
and for all, the precise delineations of the workers'
struggle. He envisions the general strike as "a body of
images capable of invoking instinctively all the sentiments
which correspond to the different manifestations of war
undertaken by Socialism against modern
society."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Sorel champions what he calls the
philosophy of "pessimism," which emerges heroically from the
shambles of satirical thinking. For the pessimistic
chiliast, radical change is utopian rather than actual. If
the evils from which society suffers are understood as
structural, their exposure must rely on an unrelenting
violence rather than a rhetorical promise that violence is
indeed at work and guilt can be pinpointed. This is not to
say that radical change is never worth the attempt, but
instead that it falls short everywhere, and not merely
because of political contingencies or counter-revolutionary
retaliation. Change is abortive precisely because it is the
impossible reservoir of millenarian hopes: a dream. In this
world, hope might exceed its best intentions, warping them
in the process. But the "image" of change is uncompromising,
as the malcontent Souvarine--a Russian, significantly, and
Bakunin's disciple--asserts in Zola's <I>Germinal:</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Don't bother me with your evolution! set fire to the four
corners of the town, mow down the people, level everything,
and when there is nothing more of this rotten world left
standing, perhaps a better one will grow in its
place.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Sorel, for all his enthusiasms and subsequent
disillusionment, knows the full torment of Souvarine's
"perhaps," a term that beckons from beyond the rational
limits of possibility. Still, he holds to the fantastic
notion that we cannot approach a new order without utterly
demolishing the current one, and builds on the site of that
very "perhaps" the positive myth of violence. Despite his
oft-quoted assertion that art is the image of all life after
the revolution, it is the image of violence itself that
ensures the possibility of collective action, not any facile
parables of a peaceful world.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The "myth" of
violence is at once both the demolition of the current order
(the general strike) and the tortured "perhaps" in which the
future is dreamed and idealized. It is in this sense that I
want to speak of the dream life of political violence, and
to relocate Sorel as a theoretician of the modern imaginary
rather than as a purveyor of positivist sociology.

<p>
Bakunin's famous assertion that the desire for destruction
is at the same time a creative desire underscores the
clarifying and dramatic impulses at work in such a
simplification of human experience.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
But once
again we must examine the tension between violence as
defining act and violence as chaos. Zola's Souvarine holds
fast to "intrigue" and scoffs at Marx's pretense that the
worker will rise "in the clear light of day."
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
If the open act of violence is the method of revelation that
clarifies the true terms of the struggle, then intrigue and
a shadowy underworld seem to be its matrix. These
tensions--between action and plot, instantaneous
clarification and dim obfuscation, apocalypse and history,
the violence of demolition and that of regeneration, the
scientific struggle of the workers and
pandemonium--characterize the performance of anarchy before
its imagined audience. 

<B></B>

<p>
We cannot overemphasize the systematic if ambiguous
dependence of the bombthrower upon the scarred field of late
Victorian temperament, so fiercely haunted by the
subcultures of discontent, by those spectral but
demographically insistent forms that do not so much lie
beneath as comprise the surface and limits of public
consciousness. As I have suggested, the act of violence
demands an audience. Benjamin's brief meditations on the
"destructive character," moved by a compulsion to clear the
path regardless of what will be built upon that demolition,
assures a <I>spectacular </I>nihilism: "the destroyer must
constantly be surrounded by people, witnesses to his
efficacy."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Much of the violence involved in
acts of "terrorism" is avowedly a way of getting people to
pay attention.

<p>
Sorel asserts that "Socialism is wholly comprised" in the
myth of the general strike, and that <I>"the myth in its
entirety . . . is alone important" </I>(<I>RV,</I> 137,
136). Consequently he disavows interest in any scientific
predictions about the course of the revolution, and has
nothing but contempt for the aspirations of the state.
Sorel's body of myth is intuitive, pictorial, immediate, and
chiliastic, setting itself against both narrative and the
vagueness of language itself. It is designed to keep class
conflict an active force:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Experience shows that the <I>framing of a future, in some
indeterminate time, </I>may, when it is done in a certain
way, be very effective, and have very few inconveniences;
this happens when the anticipations of the future take the
form of myths, which enclose with them all the strongest
inclinations of a people, of a party or of a class,
inclinations which recur to the mind with the insistence of
instincts in all the circumstances of life; and which give
an aspect of complete reality to the hopes of immediate
action by which, more easily than any other method, men can
reform their desires, passions, and mental activity. [<I>RV,
</I>133]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Because Sorel sees no necessary correspondence between
economic interests and political ideology, it becomes
requisite to establish a generalized class consciousness, to
wilfully enact a vision of struggle, and to impress upon a
corrupted consciousness an indeterminate framing of the
future in order to clarify the workers' view of the
present.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
As syndicalism expresses the
political independence of the workers, so too will the
general strike express the independence of desire, an
independence that obviates centralized planning. What Sorel
outlines is a sort of formal aspiration that, like modernist
art, rejects political rationalism. The interest here is in
the way that Sorel both suspends and performs the
possibility of violence before his audience, and the ways in
which this drama enacts within itself the struggle for the
ethical type of audience it wishes to create.

<p>
While Sorel's reading of Marx is obviously reductive, it
underscores the desire to see and act upon the base causes
of injustice in the world. Sorel is prepared to create a
myth that will delineate exactly the shape of what T. E.
Hulme translates as "class war," even when history refuses
to produce such war. Such a reading, especially when
juxtaposed with the seemingly universal dread of disorder,
points to the tensions arising between the rebellious re
of the anarchist and the audience. For 

<B></B>

if anarchist violence
as laid out by Sorel works to establish a mythic community
of clear-eyed revolutionaries, it also summons into active
being the oppositional community of the right-minded, which
exists as much by the virtue of the threat that anarchy
poses to it as by virtue of any genial or genetic bonds.

<p>
Yet desire is a conundrum. Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe
draw on Sorel in order to solve the dilemma posed by Rosa
Luxemburg's "spontaneism," a scheme that wrestles with the
unruliness of the working class.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Luxemburg
expresses faith in the masses, but also betrays
condescending impatience with them, leavened only by the
saintlike tolerance of the revolutionary. She fails to
acknowledge the crisis (the multiplicity of subject
positions resistant to the simple class analysis of the
party) named by her own pamphlet, <I>The Mass Strike.
</I>Thus anarchism: in <I>Reflections, </I>at least, Sorel
refuses the "party," aligning himself here with the
syndicalist insistence on the immediate economic and
political self-determination of the workers. It is not the
masses who have yet to learn their lesson, but rather their
so-called leaders, who betray them at the first whiff of
power. This is why Laclau and Mouffe turn to Sorel, who,
according to their genealogy of the concept of hegemony,
quite rightly recognized the mythic (as opposed to concrete
or historical) nature of a collective overdetermination that
would unify the struggle. Myth provides the collective
enunciation of a will--in post-Marxist terms, the will to
consolidate the hegemonically disparate subject positions
that together might be said to constitute the proletariat.
Yet even in Sorel's work it is often unclear whether this
myth arises spontaneously from the collective consciousness
of the workers or whether the myth is only inchoate
spontaneity and provides the catalyst for collective action.
He testifies to its popularity, but not to its origin
(<I>RV,</I> 35). The precise distinction between being told
what the slogans and actions of the revolution are to be and
the self-creation of them by the workers remains to be
theorized. In a sense, then, this oversight frames the
dilemma of the production of cultural commodities: the
struggle for possession of one's desire.

<p>
Still, it is clear that Sorel gave voice to the structures
of feeling inhabited by the generations of World War I and
the decade immediately thereafter. He struck a chord that
resonated less perhaps with the specific class to which it
was addressed (already dissolute in class terms, as Sorel
knew quite well) than with the less strongly politically
affiliated among European intellectuals and revolutionaries
who had lived through the agonizing breakdown of any
revolutionary consensus. Antonio Gramsci laments that Sorel
never produced a theory of the party, though this failing,
if it is that, was the source of his subsequent intellectual
reception.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Sorel described a moment in which
the passions of the masses might be actively triggered into
a felt collectivity and constitute the emergence of a
collective will. In this century, at least, "passion" has
often been overlooked by theoreticians of leftist coalitions
who were usually carrying on about laws of history even as
they attempted to break them. Sorel's readers (he had few
critics) were quick to seize upon the outline of action he
gave them and to invoke the authority of his name, whatever
their political leanings.

<p>
Sorel's apologists typically insist that he remains unread
in any critically effective manner, that his disciples and
detractors alike--Mussolini, Lenin, Gramsci--merely 

<B></B>

 quote
his most widely known tract out of context and to their own
ends. Kaplan pinpoints the phenomenon of Sorel's open text,
which she sees as characteristic of a certain modern
restlessness set in motion by certain forms of European
modernism as well as revolutionary and fascist politics. She
speaks of the "Sorel effect" on his readers (<I>RB,</I> 59),
pointing out the possibly intentional sketchiness, error,
oversimplification, and muddleheadedness of his
style.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The indeterminacy of his text, as
Kaplan intimates, involves a modernist textualization of
political violence. The old and wearisome Marxist dichotomy
between theory and praxis is at issue here, of course, but
so are other factors. Sorel champions the mystique of
violence, not the practice, thus implying an epistemological
gap between historical forces and mythic structures--a gap
which, I will argue, modernist creative fiction rushes to
cover over. As Kaplan writes, "what is important . . . is
not violence itself, but reflections on violence"
(<I>RB,</I> 62). She is correct to establish an equivalence
between the style of Sorel, the response to his book, and
the subject matter, and to align all three under the rubric
"slogan." Moreover, as she insists, <I>Reflections </I>was
written in response to the failure of a sustained
revolutionary movement on the part of French workers. For
Sorel this was nothing less than a moral and imaginative
failure, and it became necessary to imagine possibilities
previously unknown in revolutionary politics.

<p>
Sorel is thus generally classified as a "moralist," for he
refuses nationalism (even in its internationalist guise),
and much of his work interrogates the values necessary to
revolutionary (as opposed to political) action. Sorel's work
opposes the growth of the state, here parting company with
both German-style social democracy and
Bolshevism.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
His "diremptive" (sometimes
translated as "disruptive") methodology is a means of
critical analysis, standing opposed to theories of economic
determinism and to scientism in general. Diremption is a
"method by which one could isolate an object of
socio-historical analysis in order to determine its
qualitative nature in the context of its multi-variate
relations with other phenomena."
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
In other
words, his thinking aims at integrating historical with
ideational forces, in order to show not the motive but the
functioning of any event. Moreover, theory should be
participatory, driven by what he terms a "will to
deliverance," as opposed to theoretical disinterestedness.
As Irving Horowitz argues, his later interest in American
pragmatism is not so peculiar, for he stresses from the
beginning that ideas be subject to the rule of action, and,
like William James, he adapted from Bergson the assurance
that intelligence cannot predict where things will go since
action creates its own route.

Anarchism, Labor, and the Travails of Emma Goldman
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
I have already invoked a re dwelling somewhat
mysteriously in the moment when modernism formulates itself:
the anarchist bomber. In fiction and the popular imagination
this re contains a multitude of possibilities that might
be realized through violence and that define the spectral
limit of democracy. Americans of both the Left and Right
have always betrayed an acute anxiety concerning their own
potential for anarchy, despite anarchists and libertarians
never having established any real 

<B></B>

foothold in the political
mainstream. Representations of either a fringe minority or
"mobocracy" stand in for the despotism of the popular,
wherever it has been suppressed and ignored.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
The American labor movement in its early years was a ferment
of conflicting ideologies, from which the anarchist stood
out as the most dangerous, foreign, and volatile element.
The Haymarket affair, which created in the public mind an
uneasy conration of labor, anarchy, and violence,
effectively quelled the dominance of the Knights of Labor
and cleared a path for the more conservative American
Federation of Labor.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Any remote possibility
of
a mass anarchical movement was perhaps laid to rest by this
time, as labor chose accommodation over
revolution.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
It is probably overly simplistic
to
view the Haymarket affair as an opportunity missed or lost
to the forces of repression: while it is clear enough that
an organized repression of anarchists took place, the
"movement" had never consisted of more than a handful of
members. Anarchism was effectively suppressed sometime later
by the sedition acts of World War I, when fear of treason
was invoked to justify the prosecution of pacifists like
Goldman and Eugene Debs. Anarchism attracted hysteria, as
Thorstein Veblen, defending the I.W.W. against the Wilson
administration, argued.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
The doctrine of "propaganda by deed" was demonstrably poor
public relations, effectively turning public opinion against
strikers and anarchists, and it is not surprising that there
are few theoretical attempts to justify the practice of
violence in the annals of American unions. Union violence,
at Homestead for example, was generally a form of
self-defense, however much it may have seemed to be the dawn
of the revolution to a maverick like Alexander
Berkman.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Sorel had understood violence in
imaginary terms, as defining a cause in concrete imagery,
and theories of anarchy generally deferred the actual
practice of violence to the imagination, to the ripeness of
time. In many cases, proponents and perpetrators of violence
within the union halls were plants, double agents, private
detectives, the hired guns of industry itself, who wished
either to provoke strikers to violence or to prove
afterwards in court that violence was the intent of the
strikers. Violence in any form generally culminated in a
rhetorical and economic victory for industry; the language
of the disenfranchised became the political instrument of
their overlords, for, in a sort of ironic reversal of Sorel,
it galvanized the public consciousness with the fear of
anarchy.

<p>
Emma Goldman became involved in promoting an American
version of syndicalism, although she disagreed with Sorel
explicitly about the "mythical" quality of a general
strike.
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Goldman fought somewhat quixotically
to dispel the hysteria surrounding the anarchist, although
her own role as "firebrand" played on that same public
image. An immigrant herself, she railed against the ideology
that constituted the anarchist as "foreign," and sought to
link anarchy to the Emersonian philosophy of self-reliance.
A tension arises in Goldman's thought between the heroic
singular consciousness, irremediably at odds with its peers
(thus in some structural sense "foreign"), and the social
unit that is as likely to disintegrate as to coalesce under
the pressure of violent individualism. The paradoxes that
emerge imitate the exclusionary structures of the "foreign,"
and the act of violence becomes the equivocal seal of

<B></B>

 otherness. Goldman moves uneasily from
this point into the
theory of communal action on which she comes to rely for its
praxis, thereby underscoring the radical ambivalence of her
hopes.

<p>
Moreover, she became increasingly dismissive of the debates
about the practicality of acts of violence. According to her
biographer, violence was for Goldman "not a phase of
anarchy, and indeed anarchy absolutely opposed violence; yet
organized force--that is, government--left no other method
of propaganda than acts of violence."
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
The
"subjective" space opened up by the confrontation with one's
own violent condition--making one a foreigner to one's own
self--is inherently contradictory, even chaotic, and may be
why anarchism, unlike scientific socialism, could never
evolve into a coherent theory. Here we have some preliminary
indications as to why anarchism can be considered
"fantastic" in its own terms, as a besieged ideology
compelled to fabricate the threat of a consuming anarchy.

<p>
Goldman's own reflections on violence suggest that the
actions of the bomb-carrying "Attentatur" (assassin) are a
defensive and spontaneous act compelled by the inhuman
circumstance in which the anarchist finds himself. Keeping
to the line of thinking that argues for the perversion of an
essentially good human nature by civil injustice, she
insists that acts of political violence are a response to an
already intolerably violent situation. Any uprising, as
Kropotkin argued, must be spontaneous, and will have little
to do with anarchist ideology. Theory must follow practice:
"as if Syndicalism had been discovered by the philosophy of
Bergson or the theoretic discourses of Sorel and Berth, and
had not existed and lived among the workers long before
these men write about it" (<I>RE,</I> 65).

<p>
Such arguments fail to distinguish adequately between
political and what might be called "prepolitical" acts of
violence, for it would certainly take a raised consciousness
and propitious circumstances to lash out at a representative
of the capitalist order rather than at one's wife, say, or
fellow worker. Hence the agitator's task is a pedagogical
one: she aims to raise the naive consciousness of the
untutored, and here she encounters violence--if indeed it is
violence, as Sorel has suggested--that seals solidarity and
divides or strengthens public opinion. But public education
makes a chimera of spontaneity, and the paradoxical pursuit
of spontaneity is already one of the defining acts of modern
subjectivity. In the gray area of communal consciousness
between sentiment--already there, if anarchism is to have
any sound footing at all--and politically sophisticated
group action, revolutionary anarchism must grope in
perplexity. The muddied well of anarchy, a repository of
fears, a reservoir of dreams, offers itself as the model of
a tense and dissonant collective "subject."

<p>
It will come as no surprise, then, that Goldman became
increasingly preoccupied with aesthetic issues, and was
extremely interested in drama. The public performance is at
once a form of public relations, open to a variety of
propaganda techniques acting directly on the audience, and
an arena of intensely subjective experimentation.
Performance is given its edge by the concrete enactment of
this confrontation, which both defines bodies and destroys
them. In <I>The Social Significance of Modern Drama
</I>, Goldman writes of theater's volatility, looking
to Henrik 

<B></B>

 Ibsen, August Strindberg and
other European
dramatists (even, incredibly, William Butler Yeats) to
explode oppressive traditions: "the social significance of
modern drama . . . is the dynamite which undermines
superstition, shakes the social pillars, and prepares men
and women for the reconstruction."
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
The
dynamite metaphor is hardly coincidental, and it emphasizes
Goldman's faith in cultural forms capable of demolishing
ideologies that, if they were institutionally enforced,
would be incorporated and lived out in the crippled bodies
of working women and men: thus her crusade on behalf of free
love. Freedom must be lived and performed prior to becoming
an articulate concept. The theater of anarchy is likewise
charged with the tension of the public violently
interpenetrating the private. Theater, a fleshly carnival,
enacts the form of violence Sorel had in mind.

Dynamite Talk: Anarchism and Fiction
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
During the Progressive era, American fiction writers--unless
they were hired to write propaganda for a particular
party--seldom felt the need to discriminate precisely
between varieties of leftist thought in this country. Few
concerned themselves with the vexed internal debates among
anarchists, Socialists, Communists, or the various factions
in the trade union movement. Goldman laments the
muddleheadedness of the American Left itself, deploring that
in the "indefinite, uncertain mind of the American radical
the most contradictory ideas and methods are possible. The
result is a sad chaos in the radical movement, a sort of
intellectual hash, which has neither taste nor character"
(<I>RE,</I> 65). But this muddleheadedness was less a
failure of taste or determination than an inevitable product
of the inherent tensions in radicalism and the labor
movement. It manifests itself to Goldman as a result of the
unresolved distinction between the proclaimed natural
inevitability of revolution and the need to shape
consciousness in a way that rejects all authoritarian
techniques. What looms as a failure for political action
becomes in fiction a wealth of imagined possibilities.

<p>
The "radical" in fiction is generally a stereotype and a
foreigner, marked by the extreme "autonomy of the will" of
Zola's Souvarine.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
This unlikely and fantastic
autonomy distinguishes him, especially to the bourgeois
novelist, as an extreme re, one whose appeal lies in his
capacity to remove apocalyptic desires from the frustrating
determinants of history. Consequently, he (and it usually is
a he; women become a special--"apolitical"--case in fictions
of anarchism) transgresses the limits of good sense and
responsible behavior.
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
The writer, whether
aiming to disparage the radical, or enter into some kind of
sympathy with him, is at any rate granted a poetic license
to move via his writing beyond the social limits positioning
the anarchist under the sign of the other.

<p>
If, as Lionel Trilling argues, the desire to escape society
altogether is the chief modern element in literature, then
we should expect to find res of this desire in a variety
of places.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
The anti-social anarchist is one
such. Joseph Conrad suggests as much when he identifies,
perhaps wrongly, with anarchist <I>ressentiment: </I>"I
agree with the extreme anarchist: I want total destruction.
That's good; above all, it's clear."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

<B></B>

 The dread
that attaches to these cryptic res also signals their
investiture with an unthinkable energy, ferocious,
libidinal, and charismatic.

<p>
Henry James's <I>The Princess Casamassima </I> is a
case in point. James's dreamlike rendition of a vague
conspiratorial London underground is a meditation on both
the charismatic promise of violent transformations as well
as their inaccessibility. Although Trilling emphasizes the
"naturalism" of James's account of the ethical struggle of a
young revolutionary assassin, terming the novel "a
brilliantly precise representation of social actuality," his
judgment merely indicates the ways in which anarchic
extremes present themselves as fantasy, the fantasy at the
limits of "social actuality."
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
The everyday
imagination partakes of the fantastic when it attempts--as
it so often does--to imagine its own abolition. Trilling
upholds the verisimilitude of James's novel in order to
refute Rebecca West's judgment that the book is a "mad
dream," and although West speaks perhaps more to the point,
I would stress that the debate between them is conducted in
precisely the terms through which anarchy enters the domain
of lived circumstance.
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
Anarchy offers a
utopian fantasy of violence that dramatizes, on the one
hand, the troubled structures of subjectivity, and, on the
other, the possibilities that lie beyond our assumed
condition, whose realization would shatter any comfort we
might take in the familiar. In short, violence is a mystery;
confrontation with that mystery demolishes the will to know
that motivates the revolutionary promise. In the same way,
violence poses a mystery at the limits of representational
verisimilitude (realism, naturalism); faced with <I>that
</I>mystery, fiction resolves itself into the
"textualization" of political violence.

<p>
Adumbrated in such novels as <I>The Princess Casamassima
</I>are many of the endemic "social" concerns, the
repression of which formed one of the great projects of
modern aesthetic consciousness. John Carlos Rowe argues that
James comes to define and regulate his chosen aesthetic form
during the composition of <I>The Princess Casamassima;
</I>an elaborate "artistic" value withdraws from the social
commitments and pedestrian values of various "realisms"
shared by both anarchism and bourgeois
politics.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
High modernist irony marks a
pointed
retreat into the formal, away from the base politics of
philistines.

<p>
Modernism is often characterized as a threat to positivist
knowledge, and the emergence in the sciences and arts of a
network of alternatives to positivism--the theory of
relativity, the Heisenberg principle, the postimpressionism
of C&eacute;zanne, cubism, the "cubist prose" of Gertrude
Stein, the formal experimentation of poets and fiction
writers--can be seen as signifying an extensive crisis of
representation, the deterioration of foundational systems of
knowing. Though this crisis had much to do with the
devastation of World War I, there are other political
considerations central to the narrative of emerging
modernism. At the epistemic faultline of the modernist
aesthetic is the anarchist, who challenges the political
engines of the will-to-knowledge. Before these fantasies of
violence, positivist knowledge is compelled to retreat.
Modernism might thus be called the formal version of the
textualization of violence. Within the endeavor to create a
modernism capable, as Jameson says, of holding a deep-rooted
"political" realm at bay, is an attempt to manage--initially

<B></B>

 through the power of
personification--those extremes of the
tortured political sensibility sheltered by the abstract
"anarchist" or secret agent.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The strangely
charismatic volatility represented by such caricatures is
shunned and then refabricated as a precise textual dynamic,
evident as much in Sorel and Benjamin as in the dislocated
consciousness of the classic high modernist novel.

<p>
This is not so far from Emma Goldman's social dynamite as it
at first might seem. Jameson notes that Joseph Conrad's
conservative novels are complicitous with an exhaustive
strategical attempt to define a dangerous and irrational
<I>ressentiment </I>as the "true source of all revolutionary
behavior," thereby removing anarchism from the field of
legitimate politics (<I>PU,</I> 268). By exiling "extreme"
or "fanatical" positions and focusing obsessively on their
cruelty and terror, Conrad fabricates a nostalgic "whole"
distinct from the threat of disorganization embodied in the
terrifying re of the anarchist. In line with Benjamin's
famous contention that fascism is the aestheticization of
politics, the formalized reworking of fantasies of violence
is followed by a formalization of violence itself. Violence
is thus fantasized on two fronts of consciousness: what
assumes fantastically threatening proportions can be
effectively internalized and neutralized by the
accommodation of threat as fantasy. A formal device, this
evasion participates in the production of the modern temper
and is involved in the artist's attempt to distance his own
products and services from those of mass production. Critics
today point to the irony of such an attempt, for it follows
the very methods of the marketplace it has rejected, and one
notes as well that postmodern packaging is merely the
hyper-acceleration of such a process. As Guy Debord and Jean
Baudrillard have argued in different ways, "aesthetic"
simulacra come to supplant the "real," a real still
understood as violent--as in Jameson's dictum that history,
however inaccessible it has become, is what hurts.

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
It seems strange to speak of a withdrawal from politics on
the part of modern writers before the enthusiasm generated
by the Russian revolution, and before the great experiments
in proletarian fiction and social realism by American
writers during the 1930s.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Each of these
episodes had its own political and cultural history, during
which the field of politics was specifically reoriented for
the purposes of cultural appropriation. Lenin, indeed,
condemned and purged "petit bourgeois" anarchist tendencies.
A lingering effect of the Soviet Revolution, cultural no
less than historical, was to foreclose certain possibilities
for the anarchist Left.

<p>
Although a certain anarchist cult, centered around Goldman
and Big Bill Haywood, survived among the Greenwich Village
literati until World War I, this foreclosure was taken up
later by novelists of the socialist realist school. This
project did not differ so much from the efforts of
protomodernists like James and Conrad, even if the aesthetic
and political purposes of the earlier writers and the later
were radically opposed to one another. The common ground was
a participation in the regulation, organization, or
resistance of libertarian impulses. For later social
realists, 

<B></B>

 such impulses were generally
condemned as a
historically useless adventurism characteristic of bourgeois
individualism; for modernists that same adventurist
ethos--understood as leading inevitably to catastrophic
violence if left to its own devices--was therefore
curtailed, captured, and reframed as an aesthetic
temperament.

<p>
By the 1930s, there was little interest on the Left in the
possibilities of anarchism; except for the occasional piece,
such as Louis Adamic's curiously nostalgic <I>Dynamite
</I>, everyone was interested in collective action and
solidarity to the point of obeisance. This was true despite
the support generated among intellectuals for Sacco and
Vanzetti, whose execution may have sealed the fate of U. S.
anarchism for the next several decades. An underground
anarchism can be glimpsed through the 1930s and 1940s,
buried in the pages of <I>The Catholic Worker, </I>the
Yiddish <I>Freie Arbeter Shtimme, </I>as well as in several
Italian-language newspapers.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The reasons for
the near extinction of anarchist thought are numerous,
ranging from the expulsion of anarchist agitators from the
U. S., the successful public demonization of anarchism, the
catastrophe of the Great Depression, the threat of fascism
as an organized response to world-wide depression, the
willingness of Roosevelt to offer labor a slice of the
economic pie by way of the New Deal, and the defeat of the
coalition of anarchists with other factions in Spain. Though
the Spanish and their allies on the American Left felt
betrayed by the Soviets in the Spanish Civil War, as well as
by Stalin's other activities, it was not until the late
1950s that anarchism emerged once again as a response to the
Cold War impasse, as the testimony of the skeptic Dwight
MacDonald suggests. Indeed, the question remains as to why
reformed leftist intellectuals in the U. S., other than
MacDonald, Paul Goodman, and a handful of West Coast
pacifists, felt constrained to embrace Cold War liberalism
in opposition to Stalinism without ever examining the
anarchist heritage. The oversight is evident across the
Atlantic as well: in France, Albert Camus was the only major
intellectual to put forth anything like a case for
anarchism.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

<p>
In <I>Language and Symbolic Power, </I>Pierre Bourdieu
analyzes the complex relationships among symbolic violence,
the varieties of cultural capital, and the economic
structure. He emphasizes the material nature of language,
and insists its power cannot be abstracted from the
extralinguistic world that validates language as
power.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Spoken violence is not simply a
question of power relations that will somehow be
"negotiated," nor is the violence merely linguistic. The
threats of violent speech, violent language--the repertoire
of "dirty" words available to the satirist and the
rebel--are more powerful than threats to ideological
illusions. Narrative shies away from the violence that
everywhere threatens its exclusive legitimacy, and the
modern imagination, an historical construct, distances
itself from the violence of the world while seeking to
manage real threats by assigning them the name "terror."
Terror in fact goes by different names; repressed,
mutilated, commodified, it re-emerges insistently, often as
"text" (but a deeply somatic text), according to the
dictates of several traditions, a few of which I have
sketched out above.

<p>
It is not enough to explain these cultural and social
reckonings of violence as mere mechanisms of rearguard
ideologies. Theories of ideology have rarely considered the

<B></B>

 dense materiality of ideological
formations, even as they
have seldom, until Gramsci, appreciated the radically
hegemonic and potentially infinite formations constitutive
of ways of being. But ideology is much more than a head
game. Jameson, after writing that modernism can be "read as
a Utopian compensation for everything reification brings
with it" by opening up new perceptual and imaginative
possibilities (<I>PU, </I>236), hints at an epilogue:
libidinal utopian impulses, buried in modernist texts, come
to be resurrected and transformed by the New Left, and the
same energies help to fabricate the postmodern:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This vocation of the perceptual, its Utopian mission as the
libidinal transformation of an increasingly dessicated and
repressive reality, undergoes a final political mutation in
the countercultural movements of the 1960s (at which point
the ambiguity of the impulse also becomes more pronounced,
and the remainder of the accompanying "ideological" value of
the perceptual as the expression of psychic fragmentation is
once more politically timely). [<I>PU, </I>237]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The dramatic staging of perceptual utopias entails the
elaboration of a somatic counterfantasy, a passage through
the violent constraints in which we find ourselves. The
beginnings of such a counterfantasy can be found in the
anarchist imagination, which, when it accepts its own
confusions as a virtue, is able to leap violently beyond the
limits of satire.

<p>
The lessons learned from an analysis of the modern reaction
to the nature of violence might also help to situate a study
of the renewed interest in the possibilities of (a
libidinized) chaos. Postmodern writers reveal the anarchic
political possibilities explored by the New Left. Truly,
most of the speculation surrounding postmodernism is useless
nailbiting, particularly when viewed from the context of the
former Soviet Bloc (I write this in Brno, Czech Republic).
The exhaustion of the New Left provides the unstable
platform upon which the present generation of writers and
critics stands, when the notion strikes us, to survey the
world.

<p>
Imagism occupies a special place in the history of
Anglo-American poetry. In classrooms it is commonly taken to
represent the impulses of modernism in poetry. The
modestness of the poems by Pound, H.D., Williams, and others
in Pound's <I>Des Imagistes </I> and later anthologies
is acknowledged at the same time that the impact of Imagist
tenets on subsequent poetry is shown to have been decisive
and far-reaching. This approach to Imagism presents the
effects of modernism as technical: the elimination of
indefinite descriptive language, the fragmentation of
syntax, the breakdown of meter, and the banishment of
discursive language. Since we have known for some time,
however, that literary movements even more than individual
literary creations are never merely technical, never void of
ideology, one obvious interpretive task has been to infer
the implicit political significance of poems such as H.D.'s
"Heat," Pound's "In a Station of the Metro," or his prose
accounts of Imagist doctrine. This critical procedure,
though, has several unattractive consequences. First, the
process of inference is often guided by essentialist
conceptions of political positions--a "fascism," most
importantly, that one understands retrospectively as
implicit in poems of 1913. Second, when some recognizable
political position can be inferred by a process of
extrapolation, one may not work hard enough to reconstruct
the less recognizable aspects of the ideological context of
the text, in this case of London in 1913-14. In the case of
Imagism, the political positions that did not survive the
years just before World War I are obscured by those that,
after World War II, have become crucial to literary
historians. 

<B></B>

 Third, this procedure
presents Anglo-American
modernists as having suppressed their political motivation
under a cover of formal proposals, whereas the truth is more
that formal procedures were understood by poets and readers
as implicitly but importantly expressive of political ideas.

<p>
The most trenchant statement of the political significance
of the Imagist method was Donald Davie's in 1952:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
By hunting his own sort of "definiteness" (truth only in the
particular) he [Pound] is led to put his trust not in human
institutions but in individuals. Similarly he pins his faith
on individual words, grunts, broken phrases, half-uttered
exclamations (as we find them in the <I>Cantos</I>), on
speech atomized, all syllogistic and syntactical forms
broken down. Hence his own esteem of the definite lands him
at last in yawning vagueness, the "intuitive" welcome to
Mussolini (he "plays his hunch"). . . .
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be too much to say that this is the
logical end of abandoning prose syntax. But at least the development from
imagism in poetry to fascism in politics is clear and
unbroken.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
There is much about these remarks that is revealing still,
and some of it (pertaining to individuals and institutions)
is very close to the historical context I want to
reconstruct. But what is obscured by this view of the
techniques of Imagist poetry is the fact that this poetry
was written and initially interpreted in an intellectual
context that included not protofascism but some other--not
altogether unattractive--derivatives of anarchist and
syndicalist, thought, to which Pound and others directed
Imagist poems and the publicity on their behalf. My point is
not that there are no connections between Imagism and
Pound's later fascism, or among anarchism, syndicalism and
fascism, but rather that one can tune one's understanding of
Pound's pre-war political affiliations and those of his
collaborators more finely than is usually done, and that the
politics of modernism was more complicated than is usually
acknowledged. Davie's claim was always that the taste for
Imagist techniques in poetry after World War II was
unwittingly complicitous with the impulses that promoted
Italian fascism in the 1920s and 1930s. My own sense is that
the techniques of Imagism carry no necessary political
valence beyond that attributed to them by readers and
writers in a particular place and time. But whether
techniques are essentially neutral, as I believe, or not,
the question I wish to raise is whether Imagism was not
libertarian or antisocialist rather than protofascist in its
political significance.

<p>
The particular context I will invoke is that of the journals
<I>The New Freewoman </I> and its successor <I>The
Egoist </I>(1914-19). Pound wrote seventy-five items in
these journals during these years when he was also closely
associated with <I>Poetry, The New Age, </I>and <I>The
Little Review. </I>He was apparently comfortable in 1913
writing and soliciting manuscripts for <I>The New Freewoman,
</I>whose first pages were regularly filled by Dora
Marsden's dissenting feminist editorials. He was entirely
capable of complaining about women editors whom he did not
altogether admire; his remarks about Harriet Monroe make
that clear. But about Marsden he was not ungenerous; though
he was cautious, he was not even particularly critical of
her until 

<B></B>

 1917.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
In 1913,
as he was first
collaborating in the journal, he wrote that, although he
needed some editorial latitude, he did not want the literary
pages that he might edit to "queer the editorial
columns."
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
He respected Marsden's role in the
writing (not just the running) of <I>The New Freewoman
</I>and <I>The Egoist. </I>He warned Amy Lowell that to
purchase the journal and move it to Boston might be
expensive, "unless Miss Marsden can keep her corner or some
corner to let loose in. She has her own clientele who look
for her."
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
He was slightly cagey, it is true,
about his connections to the journal, though rather less so
when speaking directly to Marsden. "The seven minutes at my
instant disposal is hardly enough to define my philosophical
credentials adequately," he wrote to Marsden, the
philosophizing editor of <I>The New Freewoman, </I>in July
1913. "I suppose I'm an individualist. . . ."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
On the other hand, he did not claim to approve of all that
appeared in the journal's pages: "I'm responsible for what I
get into the paper but I am at present nearly, oh we might
as well say quite, powerless to keep anything
out."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
What might the term "individualist" have meant in mid-1913?
And how serious was Pound about this affiliation? First, it
was the rubric under which <I>The New Freewoman </I>(after
1913) and <I>The Egoist </I>would appear: <I>The Egoist: An
Individualist Review. </I>Pound was deliberately, however
diffidently, asserting ideological conformity to the general
position of the journal, and that position, as Michael
Levenson has shown, derived from the writings of Max
Stirner, Karl Marx's one-time friend and his adversary in
<I>The German Ideology. </I>

<p>
Stirner was the author of the anti-liberal polemic <I>Das
Einzige und sein Eigentum (The Ego and Its Own) </I>,
the first English translation of which appeared in London
and New York in 1907 with an introduction by the anarchist
Benjamin R. Tucker, who was also the American publisher; six
subsequent editions came out in London (1912, 1913, 1915,
1921) and New York (1913, 1918) during the next fourteen
years. (In 1918 Boni and Liveright--the publisher of Pound
after 1920, and of <I>The Waste Land </I>in 1922--included
Stirner's book in its Modern Library series.) <I>Das Einzige
</I>was translated into French , Spanish , and
Italian  as well; a Hebrew translation appeared in New
York in 1916. Stirner's book certainly hit a nerve--and
nowhere more than in England.

<p>
Before its publication, the key-term of his book,
"individualism," had circulated widely among libertarians
and anarchists. Benjamin Tucker's journal <I>Liberty </I>had
kept the significance of the term in debate during the
1890s. Between 1906 and 1910 six books with the words
"individual," "individualism," or "individualists" appeared
in London; whereas in the preceding five years there had
been only one. In 1911 four more such books were published,
and then six more between 1912 and 1915. The prerogatives of
the individual were a subject of controversy, which is to
say explicit uncertainty, in the 1890s and even more so in
England after 1906. Michael Levenson's recent book,
<I>Modernism and the Fate of the Individual, </I>shows that
British novelists from Conrad to Woolf were subjecting to
corrosive scrutiny the idea that there is some indissoluble
integrity to the individual psyche.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Against
the writing of Ford in <I>The Good Soldier </I> and
Lewis in <I>Tarr </I>, Stirner, Marsden, 

<B></B>

 and Pound
were trying to retain boundaries around the options of the
individual that belonged more to the nineteenth than to the
twentieth century.

<p>
Stirner made nominalism carry the force of antiliberalism,
as it later, for Marsden, carried that of antisocialism. The
liberal, Stirner argued, "takes little heed of what you
are<I> privatim--</I>nay, in a strict following out of his
principle sets no value at all on it--he sees only what you
are <I>generatim.</I>"
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
One can readily see
that the poetics of this antiliberalism would encourage a
numbering of the streaks of the tulip, details stripped of
the discursive apparatus that facilitates generalization.
Stirner intended to correct the excesses of intelligence. As
ideas become formulated they acquire, according to Stirner,
an undue power: "with so many a man a thought becomes a
'maxim,' whereby he [man] himself is made prisoner to it, so
that it is not he that has the maxim, but rather it that has
him" (<I>EIO,</I> 67). The discursive forms themselves
empower ideas well beyond their deserts. The rebellion
against this domination of ideas "like right, the State,
law" must take a nihilistic form: "only thoughtlessness
really saves me from thoughts," Stirner argued (<I>EIO,</I>
148). The signs of so-called thoughtlessness in poetry might
well be avoidance of logical connectives, smooth
transitions, explanation in fact of any sort. I am
extrapolating these literary analogues to Stirner's
philosophical views in order to suggest that Imagist poets
had no difficulty seeing their art in Stirnerian terms.

<p>
Marsden's significance for literary history is that she saw
some of the literary implications of Stirner's antistatist
philosophy.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
According to Les Garner, she first
read Stirner's <I>The Ego and Its Own </I>in August 1912,
and this changed everything for her, in particular by
dissolving her faith in the Suffrage Movement. From this
viewpoint, developed by Levenson and K. K. Ruthven,
Marsden's suffrage journal, <I>The New Freewoman, </I>was
taken over in 1914 by Pound, Aldington, and other male
writers who pressed the nonfeminist title, <I>The Egoist,
</I>on her and her co-editor Harriet Shaw
Weaver.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Marsden herself, however, preferred the
title <I>The Egoist, </I>and for her it had a deeper
importance than it could have for her male collaborators. I
believe that she read Stirner before she edited even <I>The
Freewoman </I>(1911-12), the title of which, along with that
of her first editorial on Bondwomen, came from a passage in
Galatians that Stirner cites: "The Jerusalem that is above
is the freewoman; she is the mother of us all" (Gal. 4.26;
<I>EIO, </I>157). Stirner's reference is to the sons of
Abraham, "the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh;
but he of the freewoman was by promise." (Gal. 4.22-23)
Marsden's shift of title to <I>The Egoist </I>entailed no
qualification of her commitment to Stirner's beliefs, though
the connection to the women's movement was less obvious
thereafter. Marsden was a Stirnerite, I believe, as early as
1911, when she initiated her literary career. The Stirnerian
stress of <I>The Egoist </I>was carried over from <I>The New
Freewoman; </I>it came from Marsden, certainly not from
Pound and Aldington, who must have been introduced to
Stirner by Marsden's writings.

<p>
As Mike Weaver notes, "Almost contemporaneously with the
[April 1913] appearance of the Imagist manifestoes in
<I>Poetry, </I>Miss Marsden began [in August 1913] to relate
the doctrines of the new movement to her own philosophical

 This is
surprising because
she was mistrustful of literature. Although she was educated
in the arts, Jane Lidderdale says, Marsden was uninterested
in literature. "As for EP's poems," she wrote to Harriet
Shaw Weaver in November 1913, "I haven't read 'em. Speak it
not. He is a nice old thing" (<I>DMW, </I>73). Her effort to
commandeer Imagism into her sense of Individualism, or
egoism, was actually opportunistic. She wanted to have a
literary flank to her movement, and Imagism was to be just
that, lending cultural breadth to her brand of feminism, and
claiming for it too the timeliness and fruitfulness of a
philosophy in close touch with the arts.

<p>
Marsden's mistrust of literature derived partly from the
physical persuasiveness of the art. She was suspicious of
the sensuality of even ordinary language, so she had to be
especially wary of poetry. "The hypnotism of sound lulls
sense into accepting a 'thought,' i.e. an error born of
ineffectual thinking, into its categories of existent
things, and giving to it a 'local habitation and a
'name.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
Her account of the seductiveness of
language depended upon a late nineteenth-century sense of
the symbolist aesthetic; her remarks resemble Yeats's
altogether sympathetic account in 1900 of the effect of
metrical language: to hush "us with an alluring monotony, .
. . to keep us in that state of perhaps real trance, in
which the mind liberated from the preserve of the will is
unfolded in symbols."
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Marsden regarded herself
as deeply antisymbolist in literary as well as political
matters. Symbols distract people from actualities, as she
argued. And symbols, above all words, she recognized, are
the special province of poetry:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A legitimate ambition founded on a legitimate basis--the
Vote. . . . What has happened? She [Mrs. Pankhurst] has
pinioned herself with words--words--words, and these, not
her own. She ventured into the maze of the symbolists, whose
vulturous progeny--the empty concepts--got her!. . . . The
Cause is the empty concept--the fount of all insincerity:
the Cause of the Symbol--the Nothing worked upon by the
Dithyramb.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
This comes from Marsden's opening editorial for <I>The New
Freewoman </I>in June 1913, just after Emily Davison had
thrown herself in front of the King's horse at the National
Derby in order to demonstrate on behalf of suffrage. Marsden
felt keenly the death of her old friend as well as the
threat that Mrs. Pankhurst might be killed by the rough
handling that followed arrest and hunger strikes. What could
make such losses seem in any way victories? Poets, in words
and dithyrambs, might try that transformation, but the
friends of Davison and Pankhurst would know better.

<p>
Marsden saw her own work--and that of the poets she
affiliated herself with--as deconstructive:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We are analyzing terms; we believe indeed, that the next
work for the lovers of men is just this analysis of naming.
It will go completely against the grain of civilization, but
straight across culture. . . . All who wield authority, do
it in the name of an idea: equality, justice, love, right,
duty, humanity, God, the Church, the State. Small wonder
therefore if those who sit in the seats of authority look
askance at any tampering with names and ideas.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
The Imagist purge of poetic verbiage, as Marsden understood
it in August 1913, was one part of that systematic effort.
Brevity as a stylistic feature was understood widely as a
fit response to fakery in language. One month later Ford
Maddox Hueffer attributed the general dislike of poetry to
its verbiage and inauthenticity: "We seemed to get from them
[Tennyson, Swinburne, Browning, and Pope] the idea that all
poets must of necessity write affectedly, at great length,
with many superfluous words. . . ."
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
When Pound
wrote in "The Serious Writer" (the first installment of
which displaced Marsden's editorial for <I>The New Freewoman
</I>of 15 October 1913) that the good writer "uses the
smallest possible number of words," he was presupposing a
literary-critical context that had been established by Ford
(a month earlier), but also by Marsden who, a month before
that, gave an antiliberal ideological significance to
laconicism.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Marsden, for her part in this collaboration, quite
deliberately talked about poetry in terms derived from Pound
and based on the experience of Imagist poetry:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The difference [between poetry and prose] is one of brevity,
completeness and finish simply because in poetry all the
evidence of laboratory work is removed; the creaking of the
thinking-machine is not there: it has done its work. Poetry
. . . is brief because it is reduced to the exact
equivalent: it has reached the completeness of knowledge
when its dimensions can be expressed in a
formula.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
She was actually apprehensive of images, as of words; in
fact they were the same to her: "The virtue which inheres in
a word is its potency to create involuntarily the
<I>imaginary image </I>which embodies the meanings of things
in isolation from things as wholes. It releases from the
thing--its <I>concept.</I>"
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
In 1914 she spoke
of images as indispensible: "Feeling, that is, life, defines
itself into images: they are thinking's raw material without
which to work upon the intellectual process is meaningless.
. . ."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
What she sensed in Imagist poetry was
an extraordinary rhetorical power--troublesome, in that it
conveys the illusion of essences; but attractive, in that it
might be put to her political uses.

<p>
In 1915, when Pound had temporarily withdrawn from <I>The
Egoist, </I>Marsden used the terms of Imagism to construct a
psychological account of desire itself:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The vital instinct is to follow such sensations as offer
promise of developing themselves into something new: which
said differently, means that life is in its highest
condition of well-being when it is enlarging its world to
include something new. . . .
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that certain Images of the Mind .
. .
suggest the prospect . . . of yielding such experiences, and by them the
mind becomes magnetized. Where such a prospective experience
suggests itself men will harness, concentrate and apply
their energies to the utmost in order to make the more
definite Image eventuate. . . . The genius is the person
capable of great emotions and becomes the Master-Expressor
because great emotions are carried by their own weight and
clarity to the point of expression. He breaks into
Expression, not to obtain Appreciation--Honour--but to gain
an outlet for Images he is unable to retain.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
This account of the psychological force of such images is
designed to support those women and men who refuse to rest
in the forms of social stability offered by Edwardian
society, those who seek, in Pound's terms, "that sense of
sudden growth, which we experience in the presence of the
greatest works of art."
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Desire leads naturally
away from monogamous marriage, as from the political
proposals of legislators, she argues implicitly, and poetry
tracks the movements of desire.

<p>
The libertarianism of <I>The New Freewoman </I>was not just
an objection to bureaucracy, or even to Fabian idealism; its
authors resisted the pressure to render all decisions
political. "The political view of life has assumed such
gigantic proportions in our minds to-day that, as we have
seen, a lecturer on the Woman's Movement fails to see the
possibility of any progress except through legislation. All
other forms of energy are subordinate to
that."
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Socialism and the women's movement were
one in that they both looked to the state to ensure justice
and progress: politics and advocacy of an enlarged state
came to mean the same thing in the prewar years. The
antistatist views of the <I>New Freewoman, </I>on the
contrary, were presented as supposedly antipolitical. One
contributor wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . The Democratic Movement and the Woman's Movement . . .
put the cart before the horse and mistake the power for the
product. They suppose Life and Feelings are the <I>outcome
</I>of just institutions. They are not, they are the
<I>origin </I>of them. When we have all got Life and
Feelings again, we shall get living and sensitive
institutions. What is the use of tinkering with moribund
Politics?
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Individualism, for Marsden, was an effort to locate an area
outside of politics, in "Life and Feelings," a vitalist
alternative to the rise of socialism and the welfare state.
Jonathan Rose shows that Hulme's remark that "all the best
people take off their hats and lower their voices when they
speak of Life" accurately identified "the often monotonous
Edwardian obsession with that simple word."
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
In
response to Christabel Pankhurst's argument for chastity as
the remedy for epidemic venereal disease, Marsden wrote in
1914:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is more important to heighten vitality than to combat
disease: which as a matter of fact can only be overcome by
increased vitality, and there is more danger to "health" to
be awaited from the misery of renunciation and the dull
heats of virginity than from the ills of syphilis and
gonorrhea. . . . The sole thing which can be called a
"cause" of disease is low vitality and of all the things
which tend to lower it, the chief is dullness.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
No other Edwardian exploits the antistatist significance of
the term vitalism that Marsden proposes.

<p>
Her nominalist opposition to abstract terms derived from an
anarchist-libertarian opposition to the state itself, which
in turn entailed a resistance to all notions of
collaboration among individuals. This meant that from the
founding of <I>The New Freewoman </I>in 1913 Marsden was
proselytizing against ideology. At the cost of incoherence,
she refused the very notion of a movement such as
Individualism, exactly 

<B></B>

 because
individuals get lost in
crowds: "Accurately speaking," this one-time suffragette
announced in her first issue, "there <I>is </I>no 'Woman
Movement.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
She dismissed all essentialist
definitions of woman--upon which the suffrage movement
rested--together with political affiliations based upon
essentialist feminism: "'Woman Movement' forsooth. . . .
Woman? Is there such a thing even as a woman sensed from the
inside?"
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
The Women's Social and Political
Union showed what institutionalized collaboration might look
like, but more generally socialism was understood as the
state form of collaboration. Opposition to collaboration in
the arts was homologous in some fashion to opposition to
state socialism. One must remember that 1913-14 was a
crucial period in the development of social welfare in
England. Until the war broke out and the British state took
unto itself many new prerogatives, intellectuals debated
what the limits should be to state authority. After 1914 the
force of war and later of precedent rendered this debate
moot.

<p>
Pound's interest in Individualism was not just a way of
conforming to Marsden's enthusiasms, or a casual use of a
current term. He tried to reconcile his affiliations of 1913
and 1914 in terms of just this idea, lest he be thought to
be moving frivolously, in the continental manner, from one
theatrical "ism" to the next. When he wrote his appreciation
of the Vorticist painter Edward Wadsworth in August 1914, he
quickly addressed the subject of the movement that claimed
his allegiance after Imagism had passed into Amygism: "The
vorticist movement is a movement of individuals, for
individuals, for the protection of
individuality."
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Pound was far from alone in
his commitment to individualism. Aldington, an editor of
<I>The Egoist </I>in 1914, wrote: "In art the important
thing is the individual. When two individuals agree on a few
points they can raise hell; when ten agree they change the
art history of their century. (In art as in life the rarest
thing is the individual.)" He extended his point by arguing
wrongly but spiritedly that Imagist poetry had a special
angle on individuality (Aldington had not moved on to
Vorticism in 1914):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . I demand that it [free verse] receive as much or more
attention than academic verse on the ground that its use is,
at present, a sign of individuality. . . . For the essential
difference between free verse and accented verse is just
this: the old accented verse forced the poet to abandon some
of his individuality, most of his accuracy and all his style
in order to wedge his emotions into some preconceived and
sometimes childish formality; free verse permits the poet
all his individuality because he creates his cadence instead
of copying other people's, all his accuracy because with his
cadence flowing naturally he tends to write naturally and
therefore with precision, and all his style consists in
concentration, and exactness which could only be obtained
rarely in the old forms.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
This sentimental explanation of free-verse would not have
been Pound's, but Aldington's efforts show how hard these
writers worked to build a coherent ideology in the prewar
years. Both Pound and Aldington felt the burden of
explaining to London audiences how the confederations of
Imagists and later Vorticists were not bands of theatrical
conformists but rather alliances of "individuals." The
Individualist 

<B></B>

 philosophy had the
special appeal of enabling
a strong defense against the charge of imitating the Italian
Futurists.

<p>
Imagism was the perfect literary parallel for Marsden's
anticollaborative political position, because Pound and
others liked to claim that these poets--unlike the Italian
Futurists--were sufficiently empirical to consider the idea
of a movement and of manifestos somewhat ironically. Only a
"few don'ts," not a manifesto; a matter of technique, not
ideology. "The <I>imagistes </I>admitted," Rebecca West
wrote,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
that they were contemporaries of the Post Impressionists and
the Futurists; but they had nothing in common with these
schools. They had not published a manifesto. They were not a
revolutionary school; their only endeavour was to write in
accordance with the best tradition, as they found it in the
best writers of all time--In Sappho, Catullus,
Villon.

<p>
The tone of disdain here was not inadvertent. The Imagists
and their publicists effectively tapped a strain of
anticontinental <I>ressentiment </I>in London, and the
particular occasion was the avant-garde activity of
Marinetti and the Futurists. "Europe is literally swarming
with freaks," one contributor to <I>The New Freewoman
</I>wrote in November 1913.

<p>
Neither Marsden nor Pound expressed such sweeping criticism
of art movements; on the contrary, it is extraordinary that
Marsden, who was loosely allied with anarchists, would
publish an essay calling for discipline, or social control.
This dissidence with her views, and those of the journal,
suggest that she was ready to go some way to appeal to a
particular range of London opinion.

<p>
Imagist rhetoric exploited this antitheatrical skepticism
and simultaneously gained some of the cachet of
collaborative movements. The sight of ladies and mothers
demonstrating in the streets was a shocking spectacle to
many bourgeois Londoners of 1913-14, as Lisa Tickner has
shown.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
The spectacle of Marinetti and the
Futurists brought the shock of theatricality to art and
literary circles.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
It was the March 1912
Futurist exhibit at the Sackville Gallery in London that
made English artists see the need to emulate Futurist
publicity methods. Marinetti had read his inaugural 1909
manifesto to a women's group in 1910, but his 1912 lecture
in the Bechstein Hall drew an enormous amount of attention.
Over three hundred and fifty articles were written about the
show. Marinetti returned to London in 1913. Between November
1913 and June 1914, a month before <I>Blast </I>appeared,
Marinetti gave ten lectures to large audiences in
London.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Art, it then seemed, was to be the
function of impressarios and committees. The suffragettes
and the Futurists looked spectacularly vulgar to many
Londoners, including some artists and intellectuals. 

<B></B>

 And in
the music halls it seemed that spectacle was just what the
working class was accustomed to.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The
antitheatrical sentiment that Pound and others exploited had
broad roots in prewar English culture. The women's suffrage
movement, the continental avant-garde, and the working
classes in public looked alike to some Londoners: the image
of one could evoke the memory of the others, through the
experience of spectacle. Imagism was constructed as a
movement against movements, an English antitheatrical
version of the avant-garde.

<p>
So far I have spoken only of the intellectual context of
Imagism; I want now to discuss two pairs of poems by Pound
that address the subject of women, class, and the public
sphere. The first is "The Garden" and "Commission," which
appeared together in <I>Poetry </I>in April 1913, one month
after the issue containing articles on Imagism by Pound and
Flint appeared there. "The Garden" was reprinted in August
in <I>The New Freewoman. </I>These two poems express the
poet's satirical view of bourgeoise British women, that is,
of those social groups that produced the suffrage movement.
The bored, aenemic, and lonely woman in "The Garden" has no
future in the British polis, "In her is the end of
breeding"--which "end" of course cuts both ways, as pinnacle
and cessation. The "rabble," as he says, the very poor,
"shall inherit the earth." Whether she should be able to
vote is entirely beside the point. As Ruthven notes, this
poem is a parody of seventeenth-century promenade poems, in
which "the lady is usually surrounded by flowers, not street
urchins."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Several other Imagist poems bear
similar titles: H.D.'s "The Garden," Aldington's "Au Vieux
Jardin," F. S. Flint's "In the Garden," and Amy Lowell's "In
a Garden" make it clear how much Imagist poetry, however
urban its origins, was focused on the difficulties of
retirement.

<p>
Most Imagist poetry was landscape or nature poetry--this at
a time when the face of London was being transformed by
electrical lighting and trains. Aldington's parody of "The
Garden" pokes fun at Pound for dragging into an Imagist poem
contemporary, urban, vulgar subject matter: "Like an armful
of greasy engineer's-cotton / Flung by a typhoon against a
broken crate of duck's eggs." The Imagist assertion of
access to beautiful landscapes or to the subjects of ancient
Greek poetry was an effective, though implicit, insistence
on the investment of poetry in a world apart from the
structures and constraints of the collective urban life of
England in 1913-14. Politically these constraints were
beginning to be recognized through social legislation such
as the Health Insurance Act of 1911, the Mental Deficiency
Act of 1913, as well as the demonstrations of suffragettes
and workers, such as the striking Welsh miners in 1912. The
new activities of the state, however, are wholly irrelevant
to the prewar Imagist poems, conspicuously so. Most Imagist
poems are committed to the project of transcending the
orders of rationality, talk, negotiation, and politics; this
aspiration is apparent above all in the war poems after
1914. But this is not to indict the Imagists for
escapism--far from it. One can distinguish the retirement
poems of some of the Imagists from those of the Georgians,
because Imagists such as Pound ironically expressed the
desire to retire, as here in "The Garden." After 1914 the
obstacles to retirement became still more frustrating in the
work of the soldier-Imagists, such as Aldington and F. S.
Flint. Aldington's "Living Sepulchres," for 

<B></B>

 instance,
expresses explicitly the impossibility of retiring through
poetry from the trenches. "The Garden" is surely critical of
the classes of women who comprised the political base of the
suffrage movement, but Pound was skeptical too of the
prospect of removal from the political scene of London in
1913; and this was the prospect one Imagist poem after
another tried to brighten. The future of England lay neither
with ancient Greece nor with the British landscapes, but
with the working classes fenced out of the gardens.

<p>
Pound had a shallow sense of the oppression of women,
however moved he was by the suffering of particular women,
like Bride Scratton. In "Commission" he implores his poems
to

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
&#009;Go to the bourgeoise who is dying of her ennuis,
<BR>
&#009;Go to the women in suburbs.
<BR>
&#009;Go to the hideously wedded,

<BR>
&#009;Go to the woman entailed.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

These women and others are "the enslaved-by-convention,"
which is to say that indiscretion could set them free. Their
oppressors are despised, but the suggestion is that only by
turning away from the social structure of the family and
domesticity can they liberate themselves. No legislation can
do the job for them.

<p>
The other pair of poems I want to discuss is "Shop Girl" and
"The Tea Shop," which were first published in the New York
avant-garde journal <I>Others </I>in November 1915. As
Ruthven notes, the second line of "Shop Girl"--"Like a
swallow half blown to the wall"--recalls the first line of
"The Garden": "Like a skein of loose silk blown against a
wall." But the press of the young working woman is
deliberate and therefore erotic. None of these four poems is
among Pound's best, but they do show that Pound's admiration
and curiosity were aroused much less by the bourgeoise and
upper-class British women who were advocating the
suffragette cause than by the young working women who were
making their way outside of marriage by selling only their
labor.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
(The women's movement produced rather
few working-class women activists.) Marsden felt that
Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst "favored wealthy, titled
women, not the plain Janes (or Doras) of this
world."
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Pound was probably close to the
thinking of his friend Wyndham Lewis on this subject,
because Lewis too made a point of saying in the second issue
of <I>Blast: </I>"BLESS . . . All A.B.C. Tea-Shops (without
exception)."
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
"I see every day in a certain
A.B.C. Shop," Lewis wrote, "at least three girls who belong
to a new and unknown race. They would furnish an artist
looking for an origin with the model of a new mankind. And
it would be as individual and apparently strange as that
genre of Englishwoman that attracted
Rossetti."
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Lewis too liked watching working
girls, but he was a predatory watcher. According to Marsden,
women could achieve liberation only by economic means;
political enfranchisement would follow when it could be
effective. 

<B></B>

 The vote was something that
would be taken once
women had achieved sufficient economic power to control
their own lives.

<p>
Once writers such as Lewis, Hulme, Gaudier, Aldington, and
others had seen what the proportions of industrial warfare
would be, it was obvious that the modern state would indeed
become much more powerful and interventionist than it had
been in the past. The question that had helped to make the
suffrage movement interesting was settled really. Lewis had
written sarcastically in the first <I>Blast: </I>"We all
foresee . . . in a century or so men and women being put to
bed at 7 o'clock by a state nurse (in separate beds, of
course!)."
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
British Liberals had successfully
passed very controversial health insurance legislation in
1911. In fact, as historians make clear, "A 'social service
state,' in which certain minimum standards were assured, was
now [in 1914] beginning to emerge" (<I>TCM,</I> 30). When
the war was over in 1918 the Representation of the People
Act gave the vote to all men (over forty percent of British
men were without the vote in 1911) and to women over age
thirty. Women were also permitted to take seats in Commons
in 1918. The vote for women over twenty-one did not come
until 1928.

How strange that after the war ended Pound again felt the
pathos of the 1890s. But Pound and Lewis had admired the
utopian ambitions of the Pre-Raphaelites and the avant-garde
of the 1911-14 period was often measured against their
example. More importantly, Pound felt that the British
Liberals were to blame for some of the sufferings of the
Pre-Raphaelites, which is why this poem begins with
reference to the 

<B></B>

 Liberal statesman
Gladstone. When Pound and
Lewis looked at the young working women in the London tea
shops, they thought about Elizabeth Siddall, the
Pre-Raphaelite model, an oppressed woman whom Rossetti
turned into a new ideal of British femininity, as Lewis
said. She was a sign of the power of art to alter a nation's
perception. Pound had a more ironic way of thinking of this
than Lewis could manage. In "The Tea Shop" he says,

Like the poet, that is, she will turn middle-aged; she too
will spread. Will the nation <I>really </I>be altered by
this Helen? Probably the muffins will still come to the
table. And in time we will all be well-spread. Pound had his
apocalyptic moments, but the shop girls also aroused his
urbanity.

<p>
 One of the satellite controversies around the suffrage
question involved the rights of prostitutes and their
clients, or of eroticism in the public economy. The
essentialist feminism of the WSPU predicted a higher moral
tone for Britain after women won the vote. Christabel
Pankhurst's campaign against prostitution and venereal
disease was taken as a sign of what could be expected after
women began to vote. The controversy about prostitution
actually bore indirectly on the question of the power of
art. Pound translated a series of Fontenelle's dialogues for
<I>The Egoist, </I>beginning in May 1916; the first of these
is between Phrine, a courtesan, and Alexander the Great. At
issue is the relative power of beautiful women and
illustrious warriors. "Beauty has a natural right to command
men," Phrine argues; "valour has nothing but a right
acquired by force. A beautiful woman is of all countries,
yet kings themselves and even conquerors are
not."
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Phrine cites the example of another
beautiful Phrine, the mere glimpse of whose face swayed the
court of the Areopagus after oratory had failed. Phrine the
Younger gets the better of Alexander on a number of counts,
but she concedes that she had been excessive (though so had
he), in taking so many lovers that she could afford to
rebuild the walls of Thebes. Two or three affairs would have
been reasonable. "But if one wishes merely to make a
commotion," she concludes, "one may be better equipped than
by possessing a very reasonable character."
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
Phrine chose excess, as beauty does. The irrepressible
authority of beauty is exactly what Pound's poems express,
particularly the early Cantos and his most famous Imagist
poem, "In a Station of the Metro."
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
A number of
Imagist poems could be listed under this thematic heading:
Aldington's "A Girl," H.D.'s "Sitalkas," F. S. Flint's
"Beggar," Pound's "Alba" and "A Girl." Pound was close to
the center of conventional views of gender in these years.
Like any number of his contemporaries, he represents beauty
as a woman--the two were commonly synonymous. The narrator
of Virginia Woolf's <I>Jacob's Room </I>, for
instance, says: 

<B></B>

As for the beauty of women, it is like the light on the sea,
never constant to a single wave. They all have it; they all
lose it. . . . The women in the streets have the faces of
playing cards; the outlines accurately filled in with pink
or yellow, and the line drawn tightly round them. Then, at a
top-floor window, leaning out, looking down, in a
ditch--beauty glowing, suddenly expressive, withdrawn the
moment after. No one can count on it or seize it or have it
wrapped in paper. . . . Thus if you talk of a beautiful
woman you mean only something flying fast which for a second
uses the eyes, lips, or cheeks of Fanny Elmer, for example,
to glow through.

<p>
What Hugh Kenner has called a modernist aesthetic of
glimpses was understood in its time as bearing some special
appropriateness to the depiction of women.
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
The
history of Imagism is tied to the history of the women's
movement through Marsden and <I>The New Freewoman; </I>this
is a matter of straight-forward literary history. But
Imagism is also tied to the women's movement formally by
constraining itself to the moment, which was often
understood in this period to be exactly where women revealed
themselves. Women were thought to be outside of the
continuities established by male authority: the principles
and instances enforced by the legal system, or the premises
and conclusions established by syllogisms. Women were not
represented in these early years of modernism as the
traditional source of stability--earthly and so forth--but
rather as just the reverse. That conspicuous woman at the
end of a paragraph in <I>Jacob's Room </I>"who has come home
drunk and cries all night long, 'Let me in! Let me in!'" is
the pathetic rather than the epiphanic version of this
representation.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
Her husband has presumably
locked her out of her home, just as women in the street
behind her are shown to have been locked out of the British
Museum. They were eliminated from the structures of
continuity by men, and celebrated for their beauty as they
appeared to poets like Pound and Williams in fleeting
glances. Woman (or beauty) was the supposed thing itself,
beyond categories of understanding and desire. Whether one
could think outside of ideology and whether one could see a
woman were one question: "One wonders," Aldington wrote, "if
ever it will fall within Mr. Wells' capacity during his
present sojourn on earth to look directly at a woman--any
woman--Countess, High School Mistress, or the One who does
his cars and see in her something more than a peg to hang
his passing views on."
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
From this point of
view, prostitutes are neither victims of social and economic
oppression nor the agents of moral corruption. They control
their impact on men and keep their sexual encounters
brief--like glimpses. They are the masters, or mistresses,
of the erotics of the glimpse.

<p>
In Pound's first translation of Fontenelle, despite the
facetious tone of Phrine's argumentation, the implicit
question is how stable a government can be that does not
draw its power from the sources that empower art: women,
beauty, sudden visions. Pound, like Marsden, was outspokenly
antiparliamentarian: "He [the artist] knows he is born to
rule but he has no intention of trying to rule by general
franchise. He at least is born to the purple. He is not
elected by a system of plural voting."
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
This extraordinary bluster rests on the serious claim that
artists command cultural resources that might indeed
overturn states: the belief of people in sudden
illumination, 

<B></B>

 transcendent beauty. These might
be resources
that a ruler or government would wish to exploit in order to
retain power. Artists indeed might "rule" in the sense that
those values they uphold and, perhaps more importantly, the
representatives of those values, women, could gain much
greater sway over the political life of England after 1914,
but not by means of suffrage, which Pound like Lewis
supported indifferently.

<p>
Part of what is called artistic license is the right to
represent women as licentious, as creatures of passion.
Fontenelle's Dido complains to the Syrian queen Stratonice
that Virgil made her a flirt, whereas she was in fact
fidelity itself. Stratonice answers this complaint with the
story of a painter who, "discontented" with her, took
revenge before leaving town by painting her in the arms of a
common soldier. "As I was painted admirably well and with a
great deal of beauty," she tells Dido, "--although the
attitude was scarcely creditable to my virtue--I forbade
them [Syrian subjects] the burning [of the painting], had
the painter recalled and pardoned him."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
The
political power of women, art, and beauty resolves to one
force, unconstrained by prudence or rationality. Aristotle
is Fontenelle's avatar of rationality. His counterpart
Anacreon tells him plainly that philosophy is easy because
it leaves out women and the experience of the passions: "A
philosopher is concerned only with men and by no means with
the rest of the universe." Poets, drinkers, and lovers take
the greater risks: "To sing and to drink, as I [Anacreon]
did, required that one should have disentangled one's soul
from violent passions; that we should not aspire to things
not dependent upon us, that we be ready always to take time
as we find it."
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
The implicit Imagist counsel
to women was to accept and exploit a sphere (that of art and
beauty) separate from state politics. Individualists like
Marsden and Pound hoped that the prerogatives of the state
might be so circumscribed as to leave room for a separate
sphere that would not be trivial.

<p>
My argument about the politics of Imagism, I think, has
significant consequences for our understanding of Pound's
development and of the politics of modernism generally. For
it is clear that Pound in 1913-14 was vehemently
antistatist, and anti-socialist. It is hard to imagine how
an anti-statist politics would lead to the politics of state
totalitarianism, though that was the path that Pound took
and, I believe, that Mussolini took as well. In Pound's case
it is difficult even to use the term "development" to cover
these two positions. His political development seems to have
brought a direct contradiction of his earlier anarchist
Individualism. What follows from this observation, I think,
is that, contra Davie, "the development from imagism in
poetry to fascism in politics" is anything but "clear and
unbroken."

<p>
Over the last two decades, numerous studies have contributed
to a more
thorough
understanding of the cultural policies of the Italian
Fascist regime and
their
effects on artists and intellectuals.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
More recently, it has
been
shown that the pluralistic culture of Fascism was no mere
by-product of the
regime's ideologies, but fundamental to the rise of the new
mass politics,
of
image <I>as</I> substance.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
At the same time, in a different
area of
inquiry, the history of twentieth-century art has been
undergoing revision,
eroding the heroic view of modernism as an inevitable
progress toward
abstraction
and an art devoid of ideological content.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Three theoretical
approaches have been central to this critique of formalist
modernism: a
detailed
accounting of the political activism of the historical
avant-garde; closer
scrutiny of the operations of gender; and deeper
investigation of the
invigorating interaction of high art with popular forms and
media.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
The analysis of Fascist culture, however, is also key to the
reevaluation
of
twentieth-century art history, and not only because it
forces us to look
outside
the dominant French-American axis, which still constitutes
the preferred
locus of
reading. For unlike Nazi Germany, which it preceded in power
by a decade,
Fascist
Italy was not totalitarian in its cultural controls and it
supported
styles as
diverse as pure geometric abstraction, expressionism, and
academic
neoclassicism.
Because of this beguiling margin of creative freedom, the
large majority of
artists and intellectuals coexisted with, if not openly
supported, the
regime, at
least until the anti-Semitic laws of 1938. The history of
artistic
activity under
Italian 

<B></B>

 Fascism--one of contradiction,
compromise, and multiple
investments of
meaning--dismantles the paradigm of teleological modernism
and a heroic
avant-garde once and for all. &#009;

<p>
Nowhere is the dissembling character of Fascist culture
better exemplified
than
in the art and career of Giorgio Morandi. The still lifes of
Morandi, for
which
he is famous, negate the equation between formalist
abstraction and
political
indifference while laying bare the mythmaking invested
within even the most
unassuming of genres--the still life. Morandi's work has
been interpreted
as
exemplary of twentieth-century modernism, of the primacy of
form and the
extraneous role of content. After Giorgio de Chirico, he is
the best known
and
most widely exhibited of twentieth-century Italian artists,
precisely
because he
falls into the French camp of pure painting, the love of the
sensuous
stroke and
vivid materiality of the pigment. His paintings and etchings
subtly reveal
how
understatement and simplicity are the means to visual
complexity, proving
the old
adage that less is more. Morandi is especially valued among
the pantheon of
modern Italian artists because he is one of the few to have
escaped the
taint of
Fascism: protected by his reclusive life in the provinces,
so it goes, his
art
paradoxically escaped the provincialism that was the fate of
the culture
of the
<I>ventennio</I> (the twenty-year period of the party's
rule). The art
speaks for
itself: it must be apolitical, if not implicitly
anti-Fascist, because it
is
resolutely about nothing save the beauty of the brush.

The critical discourse surrounding Morandi focuses
overwhelmingly on his
<I>linguaggio</I>--his formal language.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Departing from the
lessons
of Corot and C&eacute;zanne, it is argued, Morandi distilled
his subject
and
palette into an exquisitely vibrating field of strokes, with
a harmonious
balance
of tone and hue (<a href="2.3braun_1.html"> 1</a>). From the
works of the
late teens,
when he was
associated
with the Roman journal <I>Valori plastici</I> (1918-22),
until his death
in 1964,
he was intent upon, in the words of Museum of 

<B></B>

 Modern Art curator James
Thrall
Soby, "a devout study of slight yet critical shifts in the
weight of
counterbalancing forms."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Critics have ensured this formalist
teleology by downplaying, while Morandi himself destroyed,
canvases that
did not
fit into his established phases of stylistic development.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
To
be
sure, the work is marked by periods of retrenchment and
innovation,
alternating
between images palpably solid and those dissolving into
liquified surfaces.
Occasionally, a variation, such as the addition of an object
type or a
bold color
accent, appears to augment the possibilities within the
seemingly limited
and
mundane. It is a question of subtle variations: expanding or
reducing the
space
between things, pushing the impasto up into slight ridges or
smoothing it
down
like butter. Of subject matter, there is none, since the
bottles and bowls
exist
as mere armatures for the articulation of the picture plane
and the play
with
spatial illusionism.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The choice and repetition of
commonplace items
that have hardly changed in form and function over the years
only adds to
their
immanent ability to be taken for granted, to have no
identity, or simply to
disappear.

<p>
It comes as a surprise then to learn that for a substantial
and formative
period
of his career, Morandi and his art were associated with a
specific faction
of
Fascist culture: the <I>Strapaese</I> (supercountry)
movement.
<I>Strapaese</I>
promoted the traditions of small-town life and the
peasantry. It was based
in the
regions of Tuscany and Emilia Romagna, and was inspired by
the activism of
the
provincial <I>squadristi</I> (members of the Fascist squads)
whose violence
helped Mussolini to power in 1922. <I>Strapaese</I> was
staunchly Fascist,
but--and here the equivocations begin--it represented a
certain type of
Fascism,
one that idealized the revolutionary days of 1919 and
envisioned a
rejuvenation
of Italian society through continuity with the past.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Morandi, the
international master of nuance and understatement, was--from
the mid-1920s
to the
mid-1930s--the cult object of an aggressively regionalist
movement.
Morandi, the
formalist trailblazer, associated himself with a reactionary
culture that
wanted
to get back to basics and expunge the contaminating effects
of
industrialization
and European (particularly Parisian) ideas.

<p>
It is a testament to the lingering sensitivity toward the
Fascist period,
and to
Morandi's untouchable position, that postwar scholarship has
done its
utmost not
to delve into his affiliation with <I>Strapaese,</I> often
not mentioning
it at
all.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
He adhered to it at best for reasons of friendship, at
worst
out of career opportunism, perhaps because of a certain
shared regionalist
aesthetic, but never for explicitly political motives.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
The
ambivalence of <I>Strapaese</I> itself and the differing
shades of
ideological
orientation among the group's members only complicate the
analysis. The
aim here
is not to point the finger with an accusatory gesture, but
rather to put
Morandi
in context, and in so doing to understand the contextual
nature of
interpretation.

As a cultural movement, <I>Strapaese</I> spread its ideas
and art primarily
through two journals: <I>Il Selvaggio</I> (The Wild One/The
Primitive;
1924-43),
which was really the personal vehicle of Morandi's close
friend, the
critic and
caricaturist Mino Maccari; and <I>L'Italiano</I> (The
Italian; 1926-42),
published in Bologna by the writer Leo Longanesi.
<I>Strapaese</I> drew
numerous
writers and artists to its cause, among them Vincenzo
Cardarelli, Curzio
Malaparte, Camillo Pellizzi, Ardengo Soffici, Carlo 

<B></B>

 Carr&agrave;, Ottone
Rosai,
Filippo de Pisis, and the printmaker Luigi Bartolini.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The
connections among the visual artists were longstanding:
Soffici and
Carr&agrave;
had been associated with the Florentine journal <I>La
Voce,</I> and along
with
Rosai, had participated in the Futurist group around
<I>Lacerba.</I>
During World
War I, Soffici and Carr&agrave; had also been principals in
the rejection
of
cubist abstraction and the return to classicizing values,
which, they
theorized,
were part of the grand Italian tradition. Morandi, in turn,
had taken part
with
Carr&agrave; and Soffici in the <I>Valori Plastici</I>
movement, at a
moment when
the new classicism was still infused with the unsettling
irony of de
Chirico's
metaphysical painting.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<I>Strapaese</I> was a deepening of
the
postwar return to order both aesthetically and
ideologically: the artists
combined naturalistic detail and atmospheric brushwork with
architectonic
form,
and associated this middle-of-the-road style with the solid
qualities of
the
Italian "race." Rejecting their modernist roots (except for
C&eacute;zanne, whom
they read as the last old master), Soffici and Carr&agrave;
recultivated
their
origins in the bucolic pleasures of the countryside,
rendering the local
landscape and peasantry with a nostalgic and sentimental
vision (<a href="2.3braun_2.html"> 2</a>,
<a href="2.3braun_3.html"> 3</a>).

<p>
<I>Strapaese</I> bemoaned the attrition of regional customs
and identity,
what
Mino Maccari termed "the most genuine and pure expression of
the race, the
ambience, climate and mentality, in which our purest
traditions are
protected by
instinct and love." Its purpose was to defend the homeland
against the
invasion
of "fashion, foreign thought, and modernist civilization,"
insofar as these
"threatened to repress, poison, or destroy the
characteristic qualities of
Italians." The purity of regional traditions guaranteed the
health of the
Italian
"people," whom Maccari defined (with a combination of
admiration and
condescension) as those "who go to the big circuses, 

<B></B>

 play bocce ball, love
to
work, couldn't care less about progress, and who use the
knife to butter
their
bread or when they need to defend their honor."
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Be it the
inbred
townsfolk, the perennial foodstuffs of their tables, or the
unchanging
architectural forms of their villages, the <I>Strapaese</I>
associated the
popular with stubborn sameness, political independence, and
the resolutely
antibourgeois.

<p>
<I>Strapaese</I> stood for the provinces, individual
autonomy, and
indigenous
expression, as opposed to Rome, centralization, and
imported, highfalutin
tastes.
It was especially merciless towards neoclassicism and
propaganda alluding
to the
imperial period. The <I>Strapaese</I> idea of tradition was
far removed
from
historicist recreations and mass spectacles. In the pages of
<I>Il
Selvaggio,</I>
the public rituals of Fascist bureaucrats and party leaders
such as Roberto
Farinacci were the butt of numerous jokes. Marinetti and the
critic Ugo
Ojetti
were favored targets, lampooned for career opportunism,
compromising their
integrity, or decking themselves out in the garb of the
Royal Academy of
Italy.
Another object of ridicule was Marcello Piacentini, the
regime's favored
architect, whose style of modern classicism was largely
responsible for the
facade of Mussolini's Third Rome. Yet they also debunked
rationalist
architecture
for its "Germanic" tendencies and rejected abstract art as
too rarified and
obscure. Until around 1935, <I>Il Selvaggio</I> did not
publish the work
of any
foreign artists, and continually poked fun at those who felt
the need to
study
abroad or follow the latest trends.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>

alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

While the vicissitudes of <I>Strapaese</I> are particular to
Italian
Fascist
culture, the group shared common ground with other
regionalist movements in
Europe and America between the World Wars. Here too "the
people," by
definition,
were those who toiled the soil, and whose rootedness in the
cycles of
nature and
folk rituals served as a bulwark against the foreign, the
urbane, and the
industrial modern. Above all, <I>Strapaese</I> pitted itself
against
<I>Stracitt&agrave;</I> (supercity), a trend that was
epitomized, in their
view,
by the Milanese <I>Novecento</I> (twentieth-century) artists
and the
<I>Novecento</I> literary movement led by Massimo
Bontempelli. In a
caricature of
1932, Maccari paired a nursing mother with an inebriated
slut to contrast
the
solidity of <I>Strapaese'</I>s domestic values with the
degenerate
cosmopolitanism of <I>Stracitt&agrave;</I> (<a
href="2.3braun_4.html">
4</a>). Both
the style and
allegorical conception of the image are indebted to
nineteenth-century
models,
demonstrating that Maccari's notion of the genuinely popular
was often
confounded
by cliches.

<p>
<a name=5 href="2.3braun_5.html">
<img align="right" height=125
src="thumb/2.3braun_5t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

The pages of <I>Il Selvaggio</I> represent women in sexist
terms as either
imposing maternal peasants or wanton sexual objects, with
the large
majority of
images falling into the latter category. Similarly, in its
opposition to
the
"other" that threatened the purity of the Tuscan character,
<I>Strapaese</I> was
also potentially racist and anti-Semitic, and Maccari's
caricatures contain
stereotypes of Jews and black Africans. Yet here they are
used to target
larger
game, namely the actual exploiters of the Faccetta Nera
imagery or the
proponents
of official anti-Semitism (<a
href="2.3braun_5.html"> 5</a>). ("Faccetta
Nera" or
"Little
Black
Face" was a popular but offensive song sung by soldiers in
the Ethiopian
campaign.) As Corrado Maltese has argued, at times it is
difficult to
judge if
Maccari was actually taking a moral stance or merely amusing
the reader at
the 

<B></B>

expense of others.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Only towards Nazi Germany did he take an
unambiguously negative position, lambasting Hitler's
military, racial, and
cultural policies.

<p>
"I proclaim myself to be rural," declared Mussolini in 1927,
and to a
certain
extent the <I>Strapaese</I> movement fed into the propaganda
of the
"Battle for
the Grain" begun 

<B></B>

 in the mid-1920s.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
But the
<I>strapaesani</I> were
not so easily beguiled by this form of official rhetoric,
since the regime
openly
embraced both <I>Stracitt&agrave;</I> and <I>Strapaese,</I>
modernity and
tradition, city and country. <I>Strapaese</I> resented such
manoeuvering,
and
resisted the invasion of the countryside by the radio and
cinema. Whereas
the
regime wanted to create a national culture through
uniformity and
levelling,
<I>Strapaese</I> asserted the livelihood of regional
difference. They
opposed the
idea of popular culture as mass culture, and promoted
instead the
threatened
traditions of craft and folklore and the daily rituals of
agrarian society.

<p>
Maccari was taken to task by other intellectuals for his
reactionary bent,
accused of trying to turn back the hands of time, or worse,
reduce Italian
culture to a narrow-minded parochialism. But Maccari denied
taking an
anachronistic stance: it was not <I>Strapaese's</I>
intention to reject
modernity
in its entirety, but rather to absorb it through the filter
of tradition,
and in
this way to counter a complete eradication of the past. The
bark of
<I>Strapaese</I> was worse than its bite: the rhetorical
exaggeration was
necessary to correct the balance in what was perceived as
the overwhelming
force
of modernization.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

It was through the efforts of the <I>Strapaese</I> that
Morandi's work was
first
brought to the attention of the public on a regular basis.
Indeed, if
nothing
else, the journal is credited with having recognized the
main artistic
talent of
its time.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
In addition to numerous citations and
reproductions,
Morandi was the subject of articles by Maccari, Longanesi,
Soffici, and the
artist Achille Lega, all of whom extolled his art as being
rooted in the
purest
Italian traditions.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Morandi was a featured persona of an
inside
circle, as seen in Longanesi's caricatures of himself with
Morandi and the
writer
Giuseppe Raimondi, a fellow Bolognese, in the editorial
offices of
<I>L'Italiano</I> (<a href="2.3braun_6.html"> 6</a>). His
works first
appeared in the
<I>L'Italiano</I> in
1926, and <I>Il Selvaggio</I> published some thirty-four of
his prints and
drawings over the years. Although his <I>Strapaese</I>
period is generally
consigned by scholars to 1927-32, when he pursued a more
naturalistic
style, it
should be noted that he continued to contribute work to
<I>Il
Selvaggio</I> as
late as 1940, and his personal allegiances were no passing
fancy. His
friendship
with Maccari continued well after the war, and he and
Soffici maintained a
life-long correspondence.

<p>
<I>Strapaese</I> was neither Morandi's first nor last
involvement with
Fascist
culture. Indeed, it was impossible for any artist of the
period not to work
within the framework of the regime, given that the state
controlled public
exhibitions and instituted regulations governing the
artistic professions.
In
1926 and 1929, Morandi participated in the exhibitions of
the
<I>Novecento,</I>
led by the critic Margherita Sarfatti, which promoted itself
as the
official
Fascist art. Among the three pictures he showed in 1926 was
a still life
purchased by none other than <I>Il Duce.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Though Francesco
Arcangeli claims that Morandi fled the inflated style
represented by the
<I>Novecento</I> painters to embrace the modesty of
<I>Strapaese,</I> his
career
ambitions did not suffer on a national level.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
He participated
regularly in the Venice Biennale and the Rome Quadriennale,
the most
important in
the hierarchy of Fascist exhibitions. Moreover, he had the
prestigious
task of
serving by government appointment on the acceptance 

<B></B>

 jury of the
Quadriennale in
1931 and 1935. In addition to prizes and state purchases,
Morandi's
official
recognition culminated in a large, one-man-show at the 1939
Quadriennale,
the
year of the Pact of Steel (the alliance between Nazi Germany
and Fascist
Italy).
If Morandi was not celebrated by the cultural bureaucracy in
Rome, neither
was he
shunned. After his <I>Strapaese</I> period ended in the late
1930s,
Morandi was
associated with the liberal strain of Fascism led by the
prominent party
member
Giuseppe Bottai (who had long maintained a mutually
supportive
relationship with
<I>Il Selvaggio),</I> and his work continued to be shown and
published
under the
auspices of the state. As if to distance himself from the
overt
connotations of
<I>Strapaese</I> regionalism, which was by then well past
its heyday,
Morandi
encouraged the critical support of the young critic Cesare
Brandi. Along
with
Lamberto Vitali, Brandi established the dominant stylistic
and ahistorical
reading of his work for decades to follow, and laid the
foundations for the
postwar view that Morandi refused to cater to official
taste.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
But it was with <I>Strapaese</I> that Morandi had his most
explicit
affiliation,
and in a series of articles his critical supporters deemed
him
<I>"Strapaesano</I> by race."
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Morandi's subject matter and
style
became the new expression for the old ways. His art
represented the simple
life
and respect for the individualistic temperament, as opposed
to the
bombastic
rhetoric and mass uniformity issuing forth from Rome.

<B></B>

 The spokesmen for
<I>Strapaese</I> interpreted the palette of Morandi's
paintings as
specific to
the colors--the muted rose and ocher facades--of small
Italian hill towns.
His
canvases exuded the same dusty yellow light that filtered
through the
silent back
alleys of his native Bologna. The silence and calm that
permeated his
modest
arrangements of objects embodied the very tranquility of the
provinces and
defied
the frenzied onslaught of technology and consumerism. To
them, Morandi was
a
"homebody" who had the stength of character to break with
the chicanery of
Montparnasse: his was a "genuine" art, as "homemade" as the
regional
Bolognese
"bread made with oil" <I>(GMP,</I> 49, 50).
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
<a name=7 href="2.3braun_7.html">
<img align="right" height=125

alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

As a cultural phenomenon, <I>Strapaese</I> was also
instrumental in the
renaissance of modern Italian printmaking, and the bond
between Maccari and
Morandi was sealed by their shared love for and ability in
the medium. The
design
of <I>Il Selvaggio</I> deliberately emulated the style and
typography of
late
nineteenth-century illustrated journals. Maccari himself
used roughly hewn
woodcuts as a complement to his caustic political satires.
Intaglio
methods were
congenial to <I>Strapaese</I> aims, since they were
considered to be
venerable
techniques steeped in the Italian tradition and accessible
to a large
public, yet
against the technological grain of the mass media. The group
promoted
printmaking
in a series of exhibitions in which Morandi participated.
Moreover, the
zenith of
Morandi's etching production coincided with his
<I>Strapaese</I> period:
over
half of his prints, eighty-six out of one hundred
thirty-five, were done
in the
years 1927-33.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Before World War II, Morandi regularly
exhibited his
prints alongside his paintings, and when he was appointed to
a chair at the
Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna in 1930, it was as professor
of
printmaking. He
was appointed, without competition, out of sheer reputation,
so it was
officially
stated. At the time, Morandi's identity as a master
printmaker was
inseparable
from his identity as <I>Strapaese</I> (<a
href="2.3braun_7.html"> 7</a>).

<p>
The relationship of <I>Strapaese</I> to Fascism, in turn, is
a complicated
one
and has been analyzed primarily through the history of the
journal <I>Il
Selvaggio</I> and the personality of Maccari. <I>Il
Selvaggio</I> was
founded in
1924 as the mouthpiece for the second 

<B></B>

wave of Tuscan
<I>squadrismo.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
After Mussolini secured power and
declared a
dictatorship in 1925, he needed to curb the unruly behavior
of the squads
and
began a campaign for civil order. Aware of the new direction
of Fascism,
Maccari
declared the death of the old <I>Il Selvaggio</I> and the
birth of a new
cultural
journal, in the belief that one could influence the life of
the nation
through
intellectual and artistic activity--in effect, the only
avenue available
under
the new reality of the regime. "There is nothing but art,"
declared
Maccari when
announcing the new program of <I>Il Selvaggio</I> in 1926.
For him,
artistic
production was the measure of both the "supreme intelligence
of a people"
and the
true "value of the revolution."
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Therefore, to argue, as some
critics have, that Morandi was anti-Fascist because he
removed himself from
actual politics is to miss the point. For <I>Strapaese,</I>
the very
making and
interpretation of art were forms of ideological commitment
and critique,
not
vehicles of retreat to the "ivory tower."

<p>
Indeed, as a Tuscan venture, <I>Strapaese</I> was
consciously carrying on
the
intellectual legacy of the Florentine journals <I>La
Voce</I> and
<I>Lacerba</I>
that had searched for an active role for intellectuals in
the nation's
political
life in the years before World War I. Led by Giovanni
Papini, Giuseppe
Prezzolini, and Soffici, the <I>vociani</I> theorized how to
fill the gap
between
the educated class and the illiterate masses, how to create
a national
popular
culture that would circumvent class conflict in favor of a
unifying
religion of
the state.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Convinced that the promise of the risorgimento
had not
been met, the generation of <I>La Voce</I> rejected the
liberal
parliamentary
system, as well as marxist materialism, in favor of more
radical and
mystical
ideologies that ultimately formed the basis of early
Fascism. The link to
<I>La
Voce</I> was made concrete by the re of Ardengo Soffici,
who was also
the
first to reevaluate the sacrosanct values of the native
soil. For the
<I>strapaesani,</I> Soffici was, as Maccari proclaimed, the
"Tuscan and
Fascist
who should be the teacher of us all, and to whom we must
entrust the
leadership
of our intellectual movement."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

<p>
<I>La Voce</I> bequeathed a militant idealism, strident
nationalism,
disdain for
bourgeois values, and the cult of regenerative violence to
the younger
generation
of <I>Strapaese.</I> The key difference was their respective
attitudes
towards
"the people": whereas the <I>vociani</I> were aloof, even
openly
contemptuous of
the uneducated masses whom they would deign to lead, the
<I>Strapaese</I>
held
the reverse true--that Italy would be renewed from the
bottom up, so to
speak,
from the vital roots of the earthy peasantry, or <I>Italia
barbara.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
And whereas the prewar <I>La Voce</I> had
sought to
revitalize the national spirit through contacts with
European currents, the
postwar <I>Strapaese</I> promoted a policy of cultural
autarchy that
complemented
the Fascist agenda. In its attitudes of cultural
intervention and strident
nationalism, <I>Strapaese</I> was avant-garde in the
peculiar Italian
sense, but
it fiercely opposed itself to the avant-garde aesthetics and
internationalism of
European modernism.
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Of course, <I>Strapaese,</I> like other groups claiming to
represent the
true
Fascist spirit--the <I>Novecento</I> and Futurism
included--was soon
marginalized
by the regime as Mussolini made it his policy to tolerate a
number of
different
approaches. But <I>Strapaese</I> carved its own niche deep
in the
character of
provincial and agrarian life. 

<B></B>

 It also
refused to curry favor with those in
power.
Above all, it sought to retain the pugnacious tone of the
original
<I>squadristi,</I> transposing the attitude of nonconformism
to a cultural
platform. Maccari believed that the regime and the Fascist
Party had
betrayed the
original ideals of the Fascist revolution, and sought to be
a moral
corrective
within the increasingly rigid and hypocritical machine of
the state. <I>I
selvaggi</I> considered Mussolini one of their own, not only
hailing from
similar
roots in <I>La Voce,</I> but also the hero who had
successfully challenged
both
the bourgeoisie and the socialists during the so-called
Fascist
revolution.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Despite his ridicule of the internal politics of
the
regime, Maccari clung, at least publicly, to the hope that
Mussolini would
eventually divest himself of his industrialist allies and
pomp and
circumstance
to return to his genuine plebeian roots.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
The degree and kind of Maccari's Fascism is complicated by
the creative
means he
promoted as a political instrument: the art of satire. His
tone was
polemical and
abrasive, with commentary ranging from the sly to the
scatological. Above
all, he
defended the freedom of the press, which Mussolini had
effectively
suppressed,
though small literary journals like <I>Il Selvaggio</I> were
allowed to
print in
the belief that they had limited influence. While Maccari
promoted what he
perceived as the premises of the Fascist revolution, he also
suffered
reprisals
for his open attacks on the regime. He was expelled from the
Fascist Party
in the
mid-1930s, though his protectors within the hierarchy had
him reinstated,
and
numerous issues of <I>Il Selvaggio</I> were censored and
removed from the
libraries. Nonetheless, Maccari continued to hold official
positions
within the
cultural sphere.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
As a result of Maccari's contrarian position and the steps
taken against
him,
some postwar opinions have characterized <I>Strapaese</I> as
<I>fronda</I>
<I>(fronde,</I> or dissent). As with other nominally Fascist
movements,
such as
neorealism and <I>Corrente,</I> it has been argued that
these critiques
internal
to the regime ultimately bred overt anti-Fascism by World
War
II.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
While it is true in theory that the regime's cultural
tolerance prepared
the
ground for full-blown resistance, in practice it also
allowed potential
dissenters to reap the harvest of the unstable ideological
terrain.
Artists could
continue to pursue their craft and even advance their
careers. In
Maccari's case,
it should be noted that he repeatedly stated his absolute
dedication to
Fascism,
and often, sarcastically, used the <I>Duce's</I> own words
to prove his
points:
"I reward those Italians who tell me the truth, especially
when it is
bitter,"
quoted Maccari, adding wryly that his journal had been doing
just that for
years
and was still patiently awaiting the reward.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
On 15 December
1927,
Maccari underlined that the ideals of <I>Strapaese</I> were
only those
articulated by Fascism itself, namely "Catholicism,
ruralism, classicism,
realism, hierarchy, authority."
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
Maccari did not consider himself an anti-Fascist, though he
was
antiregime, and
the two were not necessarily synonymous until the late
1930s, well after
Morandi's association with <I>Strapaese.</I> Moreover, it is
difficult to
subsume
<I>Strapaese</I> under the sole re of Maccari. It was
the sum of
diverse
parts--individuality in the face of conformity was, after
all, the very
spirit of
<I>Strapaese.</I> To begin with, it incorporated two diverse
types of
ruralism--one that was inspired by traditional, "healthy"

<B></B>

 Catholic values,
and
the other which viewed the "wild man" as a symbol of
intractable
resistance to
anything from the outside, including the authority of the
state. None of
the
<I>Strapaese</I> were as provincial as they pretended: some
adopted
ruralism as a
repentance for their modernist past, others used its
rhetoric to preserve a
strategy of avant-garde antagonism towards any or all
"official" culture.
The
movement housed two half-generations and their respective
attitudes towards
Fascism: that of Soffici and Carr&agrave; born around 1880,
and that of
Maccari,
Rosai, Malaparte, born in the late 1890s. (Morandi, born in
1890, fell
between
the two.) The former tended to be more compromising in their
relationship
to the
regime, the latter more intransigent.

<p>
Soffici, the grand intellectual father re of
<I>Strapaese,</I> was the
most
ideologically conservative, chauvinistic, and, at times,
openly
anti-Semitic.
Ironically, he began his career as an international re
associated with
the
Parisian avant-garde, and promoted new currents in modernism
as a cultural
critic
for <I>La Voce.</I> Always a propagandist for national
rejuvenation,
Soffici
converted from a cosmopolitan to a regionalist position
during his
experience in
the trenches. In his new incarnation, Soffici interpreted
the prestigious
tradition of Italian art as a guiding authority and moral
example, not as
an
ironic trope as in the case of de Chirico's art, which he
had supported
for a
brief period during the war. The nationalistic imperative of
Soffici's
<I>Italianit&agrave;</I> (Italian character), which was
permeated by a
religious
spirit, fused imperceptibly with official Fascist rhetoric.
He was one of
the
foremost theorists in the endless debate on Fascist culture,
and his
argument for
a style that was neither revolutionary nor reactionary, for
a
nationalistic art
rather than a state art, articulated the unofficial party
line.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Whereas <I>Strapaese</I> has received a sympathetic
interpretation as
<I>fronda,</I> there is no doubt as to Soffici's loyalty to
the regime and
the
regime's appreciation of him: in 1939, Soffici was inducted
into the Royal
Academy of Italy--an institution that the other
<I>strapaesani</I>
despised.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>

<p>
As Walter Adamson has observed, it was not the first Italian
modernists
like
Soffici, but rather the younger half-generation that carried
on the violent
polemics of <I>La Voce.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Indeed, it was Soffici's embrace
of
officialdom which led to the break between him and the more
irreverent
Rosai in
1930. Though the older artist had been a mentor, drawing him
into the
orbit of
<I>Lacerba,</I> Rosai represented a different Fascist creed,
one that was
essentially populist (but antisocialist) and anarchic.
Rosai, like Maccari
and
Malaparte, had been a <I>squadrista,</I> Soffici had not.
Rosai, the son
of an
artisan, was a man of the people by birth and in spirit;
Soffici had
maintained
an aristocratic distance from the masses, which was typical
of the original
<I>vociani.</I> An interventionist, Ardito, and
"Revolutionary of 1919,"
Rosai
was a founding member of the Fascio Politico Futurista (the
Futurist
Political
Fascio) that soon merged with Mussolini's Fasci di
Combattimento (Combat
Groups).
Like Maccari, he participated in the early days of squad
violence that was
directed towards institutionalized socialism and animated by
avant-garde
rhetoric
of cultural renewal.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Yet when the squads turned against
actual
workers, Rosai had a crisis of conscience, and was
subsequently disgusted
enough
by the Matteotti affair to participate in the activities of

<B></B>

 an antifascist
group,
<I>Italia libera.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Rosai later established a modus
vivendi with
the regime and worked as a caricaturist for the Florentine
Fascist
journal, <I>Il
Bargello,</I> wherein he continued to idealize the early
days of a militant
grass-roots Fascism of the people, not of the bourgeoisie or
bureaucracy.
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
<a name=8 href="2.3braun_8.html">

Morandi, like the other <I>strapaesani,</I> had been
nurtured on the
ideals of
<I>La Voce,</I> had enrolled in the war effort (although he
was soon
discharged
for medical reasons), and had supported Mussolini once he
was in power--all
towards the ideal of a new Italy. Along the same lines of
avant-garde
renewal, he
had participated in several Futurist activities in 1913 and
1914, and had
showed,
along with Rosai, in the <I>Esposizione libera futurista
internazionale</I> (the
Free International Futurist Exhibition) at the Sprovieri
gallery in Rome.
Morandi's debt to this cultural matrix is made apparent in a
brief
autobiographical essay that appeared in the Bolognese
journal
<I>L'Assalto</I>
(The Assault), in February 1928 (along with a portrait
sketched by Maccari
[<a href="2.3braun_8.html"> 8</a>]). <I>(L'Assalto</I> was
founded in
1920
as the
journal for
the
local Combat Group and then became the mouthpiece for the
Bolognese
Federazione
Provinciale Fascista; the editor at the time was Giorgio
Pini, later the
chief
editor of Mussolini's <I>Il Popolo d'Italia.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
) Within the
text,
Morandi declared himself to be an ardent Fascist who "had
much faith in
Fascism
since its first inklings, faith that has never ebbed, not
even in the
darkest and
most tumultuous 

<B></B>

 moments."
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
The not-so-veiled allusion refers
to the
Matteotti crisis of 1924, the "moment" when many prominent
intellectuals
who had
previously reserved judgement now declared their open
opposition to
Fascism. The
large majority, however, confirmed their support (as Morandi
did here), or
remained silent.
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
&#009;

<p>
More indicative of his relationship to Fascist culture than
the rhetorical
statement of <I>L'Assalto</I> is Morandi's open association
with
<I>Strapaese,</I> and, conversely, the way in which the
movement used his
art to
represent its ideological position. Of all the artists who
comprised
<I>Strapaese,</I> Morandi was closest personally, and in the
matter 

<B></B>

 of
artistic
orientation, to Soffici, whom Malaparte termed "the prophet
of Fascism,"
and who,
as noted earlier, was considered the model for the entire
<I>Strapaese</I>
movement.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Morandi and Soffici developed their friendship
inspired
by mutual esteem and intellectual compatibility in the years
after 1928,
and
continued a correspondance until 1962, two years before
their
deaths.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
Long before they actually met, the young Bolognese
artist
had gleaned much from Soffici's essays in <I>La Voce</I> on
the modernism
of
C&eacute;zanne, Rousseau, Picasso, and Braque. By the
postwar period, the
isolation of pure form achieved by experiments in
abstraction became the
foundation for Soffici's new values of solidity, permanence,
and moral
rigor.
Throughout his career, Morandi repeatedly stated that the
writings and art
of
Soffici were the most formative influence on him and his
entire
generation.
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
In addition to providing a theoretical basis for
his
work, and promoting it critically, Soffici purchased several
oils and
prints from
the Bolognese artist, and helped him attain his teaching
position at the
Academy.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
As intimate as they were, their political fates
could not
have been more different. After the fall of fascism,
Morandi's brief
arrest by
Fascist police in 1943 was elevated to heroic proportions,
whereas
Soffici, who
adhered to the Republic of Sal&ograve;, was incarcerated for
collaboration.
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>

<p>
<a name=9 href="2.3braun_9.html">
<img align="right" height=125
src="thumb/2.3braun_9t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

In his Hegelian theory of modern art Soffici sought a
synthesis of
impressionist
naturalism and optical veracity with the unchanging
structures of
geometric form
and architectonic composition. Similarly, he argued that
man's lyrical
impulse
needed to be reconciled with his innate desire for logic and
discipline.
Whereas
modern French art represented the negative extremes of
creative freedom and
novelty at any cost, the Italian "constructive" instinct
provided a needed
corrective, and reasserted the primacy of tradition. Since
his own works
were
academic exercises at best (<a href="2.3braun_9.html"> 9</a>),
it is no
wonder that
Soffici
championed
Morandi's achievement of mediating the expression of
sentiment with pure
pictorial values, while laying claim to the essential
<I>Italianit&agrave;</I> of
his research. Soffici praised Morandi's development
according to his own
dialectical scheme, quoting the axiom that "only one who has
lived the
spirit of
rebellion is capable of true order."
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
Hence Morandi rejected
his
early experiments in cubist abstraction in favor of an
overly stylized
classicism
(the metaphysical period), to arrive triumphant at what
Soffici termed the
"third
epoch," namely the period since the mid-1920s and
<I>Strapaese.</I>
Without any
residue of "artifice, cerebralism, or dilettantism," Morandi
had "resolved
the
problem of a modern style in painting that was at once
legitimate and
Italian"
("GMO," viii, ix, x).
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

<p>
<a name=0 href="2.3braun_0.html">
<img align="right" height=125
src="thumb/2.3braun_0t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

Critics have long discerned a naturalist or <I>ottocento</I>
(nineteenth-century)
tenor in Morandi's work of the mid-1920s, and to a lesser
degree until the
late
1930s, manifested in realistic description of objects and
atmospheric
brushwork.
While Morandi never copied the old masters, he openly
declared his
reverence, at
various times, for the Italian primitives and Chardin,
Corot, Courbet, and
C&eacute;zanne, whom he described, echoing Soffici, as the
true heirs of
the
"glorious Italian tradition."
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Like the other
<I>strapaesani,</I>
Morandi also admired the nineteenth-century
<I>Macchiaiolo</I> painter
Giuseppe
Fattori, famous for his style of brilliant tonal contrasts,
as well as for
his
intimate association with Tuscan regionalism and the
risorgimento. During 

<B></B>

the
interwar period, Morandi's artistic tastes were firmly
entrenched within
the
nationalistic parameters of Fascist culture, and his own art
fit
comfortably into
the moderate, if not retrograde, orientation of his
regionalist
counterparts. Not
merely a stylistic device, the quivering surfaces of his
canvases and
etchings
served as a metaphoric screen of nostalgia through which to
view simple and
enduring things (<a href="2.3braun_0.html"> 10</a>). Morandi found
amiable
insurance
against
disruptions in
his life and art in the values of <I>Strapaese;</I> this
allowed him to
pursue
professional success in relative solitude and under the
pretense of
modesty.
Arguably Morandi, like Matisse, was a preeminent
twentieth-century
modernist, who
in the larger European context, was not culturally
avant-garde.

<p>
It was the apparent concordance between Morandi's art and
the
<I>Strapaese</I>
group that dismayed the abstract painter Osvaldo Licini, a
dear friend
since
their school days at the Academy in Bologna. In a letter to
the critic
Giuseppe
Marchiori on the occasion of Morandi's one-man show at the
1939
Quadriennale,
Licini bemoaned what he perceived as Morandi's cult of the
past and the
undue
influence of Soffici:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
 You know that I have never doubted Morandi's talent, even
as I watched him
befuddled by the opium administered to him by Soffici, Oppo,
and Company,
and was
troubled by his retrograde journey, from C&eacute;zanne to
Chardin, and as
far
back as Pompei, according to the command of the <I>Cacasenno
</I>[prig]
from
Poggio a <I>Caiano </I>[Soffici]. . . . And so Marchiori,
how Morandi has
fallen,
the champion of the Italian artistic mediocracy and
bureaucracy, the
creature of
Oppo, Soffici, Cardarelli, Longanesi, and Bartolini, of all
of the
nostalgic,
reactionary crawfish of <I>Strapaese.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The <I>Strapaese</I> critics, for their part, idealized
Morandi's personal
character and artistic style: his isolation from the urban
centers of
culture,
his apparent indifference 

<B></B>

 to fame and
glory, and the fact that he remained
true
to his own path. His tenacious repetition of the same
subject, without
care for
the whims of fashions, compared to that essentially Fascist
<I>menefregismo,</I>
or "I don't give a damn" attitude.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
The <I>Strapaese</I>
revelled in
defiance and Morandi was the consummate independent spirit,
who literally
stood
out from the crowd. The visual and verbal depictions of
Morandi tended to
emphasize humorously his strong jawline, looming height, and
gangly
posture.
Longanesi wrote that for those of small stature, Morandi
looked like "an
old
schooner seen from the prow, his slouch hat rising up . . .
like a mast
touching
the clouds." Or he was described in lilliputian terms: "a
giant lost in a
city of
tiny people, he appears and disappears among the arcades of
Bologna,
seemingly an
antediluvian hulk who survived the flood."
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>

alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

The <I>Strapaese</I> notion of the authentically popular, of
the
unpretentious
character of small town inhabitants, found expression in
Morandi's
etchings of
his sister and a sleeping housewife, both reproduced in the
pages of <I>Il
Selvaggio</I> (<a href="2.3braun_1.html"> 11</a>). The customs of
provincial types
were the
principal theme
of Rosai, who depicted their narrow-mindedness and
insularity with a
threatening
quality absent in Morandi's more serene interpretations.
Rosai's images of
hooligans, self-important local priests and politicians,
artisans
assembled in
the corner of the piazza to play <I>toppa</I> (a card game)
or engage in
some
conspiracy, are as veiled as the politics of
<I>Strapaese</I> itself (<a href="2.3braun_2.html"> 12</a>).
The atmospheric touch of his brushwork and the roughness of
his plebeian
physiognomies evoke a sense both nostalgic and subversive.
Like the
characters
depicted therein, Rosai's canvases celebrate an anarchic and
gruff
humanity that
eludes both social propriety and civil control. Though
<I>Strapaese</I>
heralded
Morandi as their resident genius, Rosai is really the
quintessential
<I>Strapaese</I> painter who embodied the attitude of the
<I>teppista</I>
(hooligan) in both his art and person. &#009;

<p>
Alternatively, Morandi and Rosai together represent the two
sides of
<I>Strapaese</I> ruralism, a division created by differing
interpretations
of
high and low culture and 

<B></B>

 the value of
tradition. Rosai's anachronistic,
rative compositions defied the modernist ideology of
progress by
tenaciously
resisting the pressures of stylistic innovation. His
pictures asserted a
taste
for the naive over the sophisticated, for the lowbrow and
popular over the
prestige of the old masters. By contrast, it was Morandi's
ambition to
filter a
modern expression through the lens of the past, to extend
the pictorial
values of
the great epochs of Italian art into the present and
everyday, which made
him, in
the minds of Maccari, Soffici, and others of the group, the
consummate
<I>Strapaese</I> painter.
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
&#009;

<p>
At the same time, Morandi's position as a "modern" artist
derived from his
avoidance of the anecdotal, picturesque, or academic within
a rative
style.
He made the most mundane and long-standing objects of
everyday life seem
startlingly new, and in doing so captured the mysterious
quality of
reality. The
most minute changes in tone, hue, and arrangement
metaphorically evoked
the slow
and barely perceptible course of time itself. Not only his
style, but also
his
subject matter--objects whose designs had evolved slowly
over centuries of
use--reinforced the quotidian miracle of day to day
existence. Rather than
seeking parallels with the past--a strategy that inevitably
acknowledged
historical rupture--Morandi's work embodied the
<I>Strapaese</I> concept of
tradition as continuity. His still lifes depicted the slow
accumulation of
dust,
not the acquisitions of museums.

<p>
Here too, Morandi's working method--his revered
craftsmanship and slow
deliberation--found its analogy in the pace of provincial
life. The
ability to
learn from errors, the going back and trying again, the
subtle and endless
adjustments of line and tone testified that Morandi had the
patience of a
saint.
Soffici for one, maintained that Morandi's oils were infused
with a
religious
spirit. Be it a landscape or bowl of fruit, his images
invoke "a sense of
love
and welcoming that is not far from prayer" ("GMO," ix).
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
Soffici's
reading reveals much about his own Catholic views and
effectively fits
into a
conservative Fascism, made official by Mussolini's
reconciliation 

<B></B>

 with the
Vatican in the 1929 Lateran pacts--an alliance that <I>Il
Selvaggio</I> had
supported.

<p>
<a name=3 href="2.3braun_3.html">
<img align="right" height=125
src="thumb/2.3braun_3t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

Honesty, simplicity, sobriety--this was the triad of nouns
most used in
descriptions of Morandi's work. According to the painter and
writer
Achille Lega
(like Rosai, another <I>diciannovista</I> [a Fascist from
the party's
beginning
in 1919]), in an article in <I>Il Selvaggio</I> of July
1927, Morandi
painted his
ordinary studio or household objects--paint tins, oil lamps,
wine
bottles--"with
a conscientiousness that is rare in these difficult times."
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
Morandi
had no need of Paris, and looked no further than his own
backyard, the
hills,
foliage, and old buildings of Grizzana, his country house,
for inspiration
(<a href="2.3braun_3.html"> 13</a>). Hence the repetition of
the motif in
Morandi's
art was
as much
a statement of regional identity as it was a vehicle for
tonal harmonies.
And
even the latter could be incorporated into an ideological
reading: after
all,
only someone attuned to the minute cycles of nature could
discern such
subtle
gradations. For the <I>Strapaese,</I> Morandi's art
exemplified habit as
well as
tenacity, and his art manifested the value of the old and
ordinary in the
face of
the new and novel.

<p>
Of course, the status of the plain and proudly low is
inherent to the
genre of
still life on the whole: the common utilitarian objects used
by humanity
to wash
or eat bear the evidence of our routine existence, peasants
and dictators
alike.
It is the painting of rhopography--<I>rhopos</I>--or the
unassuming small
things
of material life.
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
Rhopography situates itself in opposition
to
megalography--the painting of great men and great deeds.
Likewise, in the
eyes of
the Tuscan regionalists, Morandi's relentless focus on the
commonplace,
immediate, and small was a means of keeping 

<B></B>

 in touch with down-to-earth,
lived
experience and avoiding the false grandeur and vulgar or
romantic tastes
of the
bourgeois. In the words of Arnaldo Beccaria, Morandi's
canvases exuded "an
ineffable poverty" that attested to the humanity and moral
fibre of the
man and
his art.
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>

<p>
Despite the <I>Strapaese</I> cult of modesty, Morandi's art
was never
extolled
for simplicity's sake alone, but rather for its
sophisticated
extrapolation of
the inherent qualities of the pictorial medium. Throughout
the
descriptions of
Morandi's humble compositions, one reads patently formalist
theory between
the
lines. For Soffici, Morandi's tonal and chromatic
relationships and other
internal expressive means were all subordinated to the
"plastic essence of
the
whole" and woven into a "rich pictorial, compositional and
architectonic
fabric"
("GMO," x).
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
His unhurried manner and visual acuity,
according to
Lega, were "aimed at studying and further deepening the
work, at defining
it
through drawing, in the volumes and impasto. . . . "
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
As
Longanesi
also insisted, the painter's most central concerns were "the
composition
of the
picture, the clarity of the masses, the harmony of tones,
the chiaroscurist
contrasts, the fusion of colors, the elegance and solidity
of the forms,
and the
tranquility of the whole."
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
&#009;While <I>Strapaese</I> openly attacked the very idea
of a regime and
the
return to order, it considered itself Fascist to the core
and unswaying in
its
loyalty to the ideals of 1919. And while <I>Strapaese</I>
railed against
Parisian
modernism with xenophobic alacrity, they were too
sophisticated to negate
modernist theory in hailing Morandi's achievement. Given
such
contradictions, it
is no wonder that since World War II Morandi's relationship
to
<I>Strapaese</I>
has been mentioned only in passing, or is substantially
qualified. Aside
from the
refusal to address content in Morandi's epiphanies of pure
form, the
aversion is
in no small part due to <I>Strapaese</I>'s reputation after
the war. While
some
have defended the program of <I>Il Selvaggio</I> as morally
courageous,
others
conclude that the movement was foolhardy and its political
effect
illusory. Both
the intention to reform Fascism from within and the desire
to return to an
unadulterated provincial past showed a profound schism with
the social and
political realities of the day. Small vignettes and
commentaries were not
enough
to effect true reform and <I>Strapaese'</I>s cultural
position was
essentially

<p>
To understand the circumstances and extent of Morandi's
relationship to
<I>Strapaese</I> is to understand the complexities of
Fascist culture and
the
compromised quality of intellectual and artistic life under
the regime. It
is
impossible to situate Morandi outside of Fascist culture, if
we consider
the
all-embracing rhetoric of that beast. Take, for example,
Soffici's
definition of
Morandi as the classical and hence supremely Italian artist,
whose
painting was
at once "real and ideal, objective and subjective" ("GMO,"
ix), and
unified the
present with the past.
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
The terms "modernity" and "tradition"
were
so ubiquitous and semantically elastic during the
<I>ventennio</I> that
they
could signify anything and nothing at the same time.

<p>
The degree and kind of Morandi's alliance with
<I>Strapaese</I> proves
that he
was neither an outright anti-Fascist nor a collaborator with
the regime.
Similarly his paintings cannot be categorized as political
manifestos; and
yet
they were also more than 

<B></B>

 mere essays
in formalist abstraction. Halftones,
like
half-truths, envelop Morandi's compositions, blurring any
absolutely clear
picture. The case of Morandi as <I>Strapaese</I> shows how
images can be
manipulated to a variety of ideological ends, while exposing
the false
coherency
and unity of the history of the modernist avant-garde.
Arguably, today a
gallery
of Morandi still lifes can be appreciated without a
knowledge of
<I>Strapaese</I>
or the conservative position of intransigent sameness that
they embodied
at a
specific time and place. But to interpret them solely as
tributes to
autonomous
pictorial values is to be party to a cultural amnesia that
arose in the
postwar
years in reaction to the insidious reach of Fascist culture.
Exquisitely
mute,
Morandi's compositions nonetheless reveal that it is just as
easy to read
out as
it is to read in.

The reevaluation of both Fascism and the history of
twentieth-century
art can
be seen as consequences of postmodern critical perspectives;
see Andreas
Huyssen,
<I>After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture,
Postmodernism</I>
(Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986). As Huyssen
points out, the
teleological scheme of modernism as the progression towards
abstraction was
ahistorical to begin with, and was established as the
dominant paradigm
only in
the years after World War II. The key text in the
revisionary view of the
historical avant-garde is Peter B&uuml;rger, <I>Theory of
the
Avant-Garde,</I>
trans. Michael Shaw (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota
Press, 1984).
Although
B&uuml;rger argues that the avant-garde is so defined by
virtue of its
attack on
the institutionalization of culture and its political
committment, he
avoids
treatment of the Italian Futurist movement, which is the
first and foremost
example of this strategy.

(Soby and Barr,

According to Marilena Pasquali, Morandi himself destroyed
certain
canvases
that appeared anomalous in the context of his development
(Marilena
Pasquali,
"'Quelle sabbie portrate a vibrare . . .' La trasformazione
dell'immagine
morandiana tra il 1925 e il 1939," in her <I>Morandi e il

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT8" HREF="#REF8">8</a>.
Lamberto Vitali, the author of Morandi's catalogue
raisonn&eacute;,
which he
produced in close collaboration with the artist, did much to
promote the
primacy
of the formalist reading. As early as 1934, he compared the
role of
Morandi's
bottles to that of C&eacute;zanne's apples, the pots and
pans of Chardin,
and
Modigliani's long necks; that is, the subject is "only the
point of
departure,
not the point of arrival; or, more accurately, it provides
the necessary
impetus
for transration." (The original reads: "soltanto il
punto di partenza,
non
quello d'arrivo o, meglio, &egrave; lo spunto necessario per
la
trasrazione,"
in Lamberto Vitali, <I>L'incisione italiana moderna</I>
[Milan: U. Hoepli,
1934],
63.) In 1965, as if to further distance Morandi from Fascist
culture, he
wrote:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
During the period between the two World Wars, when the
bloodless guerilla
warfare
broke out between the <I>Novecento</I> and <I>Strapaese</I>
groups, Morandi
fought for neither one side nor the other, even though
members of the
<I>Strapaese</I> included some of his trusted friends, and
those closer to
him in
spirit, such as Soffici. . . . <!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
(The original reads: "Quando poi, fra le due guerre, nacque
la guerriglia
affatto
incruenta fra Novecento e Strapaese, egli non
parteggi&ograve; n&eacute;
per
l'uno, n&eacute; per l'altro; e s&iacute; che nel
battaglione di Strapaese
militavano amici provati e spiritualmente a lui pi&ugrave;
vicini, come
Soffici .
. . " <I>[GMP,</I> 32].)

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT9" HREF="#REF9">9</a>.
In the words of Francesco Arcangeli: "They were Fascists,
but in a way
that
was so strange, so personal, so independent that their
struggle for
certain ideas
was conducted as though it were a game without rules,
perhaps even a
slightly
dangerous game: certainly, as far as conduct goes, it was an
anticonformist
struggle." (The original reads: "Erano fascisti, ma in una
maniera
cos&igrave;
strana, cos&igrave; personale, cos&igrave; indipendente, che
la lotta a
certe
idee sembra condotta, da loro, entro un gioco libero, forse
anche un po'
pericoloso: certo, per quel riguarda il costume,
anticonformista"
<I>[GM,</I>
153].)

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT10" HREF="#REF10">10</a>.
Marilena Pasquali acknowledges the connections between the
artist and
the
<I>Strapaese</I> movement, but ultimately straddles the
fence: "These
[statements] might seem to indicate Fascist commitments, but
they might
also be
considered the consequence of a much larger situation in
which the artist
is
involved, but which he observes as a participating spectator
rather than an
active protagonist." (The original reads: "Sono affermazioni
piuttosto
impegnative, se non vengono considerate come frutto di una
situazione
pi&ugrave;
vasta in cui certo l'artista &egrave; convolto ma che lo
vede
sostanzialmente
come spettatore partecipe piuttosto che come attore
protagonista," in
Pasquali,
"'Quelle sabbie portate a vibrare,'" 57.) Similarly, Luigi
Cavallo argues
that
despite his artistic presence in the journals, Morandi "has
little in
common with
the apocalyptic accounts found in <I>Strapaese</I> or with
the heated
polemics
that surround it. Morandi also stands off to one side among
the
<I>Selvaggi:</I>
he sends them his things, they are published, and even
presented quite
explicitly
as an alternative to the work of the Novecento group. . . .
" (The original
reads: "[Egli] ha ben poco da dividere con le apocalittiche
storie di
<I>Strapaese</I> e col resto delle polemiche accese sulla
rivista. Anche
fra i
selvaggi Morandi sta appartato, manda le sue cose, vengono
pubblicate e
anzi
messe chiaramente come alternativa ai pittori del Novecento
. . . ," in
Luigi
Cavallo, <I>"A Prato per vedere i Corot:" corrispondenza
Morandi-Soffici,
per
un'antologia di Morandi</I> [Prato: Galleria d'arte moderna
Farsetti,
1989], 31.)
Viewing Morandi's participation as passive rather than
active allows one to
suppose that he adhered for reasons of career opportunism,
and
<I>Strapaese</I>
did much to forward Morandi's success. Such a supposition,
however, as
well as
the thesis that the rapport was casual, is contradicted by
the very nature
of the
artist: both the <I>Strapaese</I> and later critics insist
on Morandi's
intellectual integrity, sincerity, and uncompromising
character.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT11" HREF="#REF11">11</a>.
Vitali set out to distance Morandi from the provincialism of
<I>Strapaese,</I> and considered it of little consequence
for his career.
A more
objective view is that of Francesco Arcangeli, who removes
Morandi from the
politics proper of <I>Strapaese,</I> but sees an affinity
between the
artist's
aesthetics and the lyrical agrarianism promoted by the
regionalists. As he
puts
it, "Morandi did not engage in active political
participation, but he knew
that
his way of life, if not its very substance, was connected to
the world that
<I>Strapaese</I> defended." (The original reads: "Morandi
non parteggiava
politicamente, ma sapeva che il costume, se non proprio la
sostanza, della
sua
vita era legato a un mondo che <I>Strapaese</I> difendeva"
[<I>GM,</I>
154].)
Here, however, it is difficult to discern what Arcangeli
means by
"political
participation," since Maccari himself defined the role of
<I>Strapaese</I>
as
that of cultural interventionism. While Maccari's use of
caricature made
his
politics explicit, with the rest of the fine
artists--Soffici,
Carr&agrave;,
Bartolini, Lega, Rosai, and Morandi--the ideological content
could only be
implicit. Even though Arcangeli struggles with the
relationship between
Morandi
and <I>Strapaese,</I> his attempt at least to account for it
may be one of
the
reasons why Morandi disavowed his monograph, which was
written in 1960-61,
and
preferred instead the presentations of his work by the art
historian Cesare
Brandi, who, like Vitale, emphasized stylistic analysis and
the universal
resonance of his art; see Marilena Pasquali, "Il significato
di un
dialogo," in
Brandi, <I>Morandi.</I>

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT12" HREF="#REF12">12</a>.
Another link between Morandi and the <I>Strapaese</I> milieu
was his
prominent role as illustrator for Cardarelli's book <I>Il
sole a picco</I>
. By the early 1940s, when Morandi was no longer
associated with the
journal, it hosted the work of a younger group of
artists--Renato Guttuso,
Mario
Mafai, Giacomo Manz&ugrave;, and Toti Scialoja--who were
more closely
affiliated
with the anti-Fascist resistance.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT13" HREF="#REF13">13</a>.
Contemporaneously with their contributions to <I>Valori
Plastici,</I>
Soffici, Carr&agrave; and Morandi took part in the journal
<I>La
Raccolta,</I>
published in Bologna by Giuseppe Raimondi, who was
subsequently associated
with
<I>Strapaese.</I> Soffici and Carr&agrave; also contributed
to the literary
review <I>La Ronda</I> (1919-22), which opposed the
rebellious ideology and
activism of the prewar avant-garde in favor of the autonomy
of creative
pursuits.
Though these periodicals were founded in reaction to the
militant idealism
of
<I>La Voce</I> and <I>Lacerba</I> (by those who had
participated in the
same),
they represent a continuation of the debate over the role of
the
intellectual in
contemporary society. That Soffici and Carr&agrave;
contributed to
different
journals of varying ideological orientations is a testament
to the
cultural and
political confusion of the immediate postwar years.

The polemic on "Faccetta Nera" is treated in a caricature of

anti-Semitic
journalist of
<I>Il Tevere,</I> Corrado Maltese writes, "In the final
analysis, it
remained
unclear whether the satire was taking aim at his
[Interlandi's] racist
zeal or
the apprehensions of the Jews; or perhaps it was not a
satire at all, but
simply
the amused, and certainly not 'moral,' viewpoint of someone
who enjoys the
show
without taking part in it." (The original reads: "Dopo di

See, for example, Mino Maccari, "Affari diversi": "A meeting
of the
Strapaese
group, which was entrusted with deliberative powers, has
resolved that the
prize
for painting for the year 1928 be awarded to Giorgio
Morandi," and "Giorgio
Morandi has been named the holder of the professorship in

three
canvases, two drawings and four etchings.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT22" HREF="#REF22">22</a>.
See Arcangeli, <I>Giorgio Morandi,</I> 153. Arcangeli's
assertion that
a
rhetoric of quality increasingly permeated the
<I>Novecento</I> is rather
inaccurate to begin with, since the <I>Novecento</I>
included artists and
subgroups of widely varying styles. Indeed, such
heterogeneity contributed
to the
movement's rapid disintegration by the end of the decade.
Moreover, Morandi
continued to exhibit, as late as 1932, in the
<I>Novecento</I> shows
organized
abroad by Margherita Sarfatti. See Rossana Bossaglia, <I>Il
"Novecento
italiano"--storia, documenti, iconografia</I> (Milan:

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT23" HREF="#REF23">23</a>.
The degree to which later critics and Morandi himself
divorced his art
from a
historical context is epitomized in a line from Franco
Solmi: "Morandi
began to
oppose the reality of memory, based on an 'eternal' order,
to the reality
of
human disorder that troubled the consciousness of those
times; to the
history
that unfolded, for better or for worse, on the Italian
squares." (The
original
reads: "E una realt&agrave; di memoria che Morandi comincia
a oppore, nei
suoi
ordini 'eterni,' a quella dei disordini umani che in quegli
anni scuotono
le
coscienze: alla storia che si fa, nel bene e nel male, sulle
piazze
d'Italia," in
Solmi, <I>Morandi: storia,</I> 56.) Also see Jennifer Mundy,

of easy formulas, was also the argument of Mino Maccari in

From 1924 to 1927, <I>Il Selvaggio</I> was directed by
Angelo Bencini
and
Maccari in Colle Val d'Elsa (outside of Florence) as a
vehicle for
reaffirming
the revolutionary origins of Fascism in the wake of the
Matteotti crisis.
(The
first activities of the original <I>squadristi</I> in the
immediate
postwar years
had been directed towards the perceived dual threat of
Bolshevism and
parliamentary liberalism.) By 1926, <I>Il Selvaggio</I> was
edited out of
Florence by Maccari alone, who then moved the journal to
Siena (1929-30),
Turin
 and Rome (1932-43). See Giorgio Luti, ed.,

echoed that of
Marinetti, who, in 1920, after having participated in the

di Combattimento, conceded that the artistic temperament was
incompatible
with
political pragmatism (F.T. Marinetti, <I>Al di l&agrave; del

(Mino Maccari, <I>Il Selvaggio,</I> 10 November 1925;

<I>L'interventismo,</I> 105, 176, no. 25).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT31" HREF="#REF31">31</a>.
<I>Italia barbara</I> was the title of a book by Kurt Erich
Suckert
(1898-1957), who took the pseudonym "Curzio Malaparte" in
1925, the year
of the
book's publication. Walter Adamson calls Malaparte, who
fought in the war
and
later took part in <I>squadrismo,</I> "the most important
single
individual to
carry the Florentine avant-garde into Fascism"
<I>(Avant-Garde
Florence,</I>
232). Malaparte's theory of Fascism idealized an
antidemocratic,
aristocratic
Italy that idealized the rituals of a primitive populism. An
intellectual
renegade, Malaparte embraced a variety of ideological
positions over the
course
of Fascism, became best known as a novelist and journalist,
and eventually
turned
to communism after World War II.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT32" HREF="#REF32">32</a>.
It is the argument of both Emilio Gentile and Walter Adamson
that the
project
of cultural renewal and radical nationalism engendered by
<I>La Voce</I>
was by
definition avant-garde and modernist, and was carried on by
fascism (see
notes
two and twenty-nine). Their use of the terms, however, does
not account
for the
schism between avant-garde and modernist political
ideologies and the often
retrograde, antimodernist aesthetics of the art and
literature of the war
years
and beyond.

As Mangoni notes, quoting the article by Ardengo Soffici,
"Mussolini
dal
vero," <I>Il Selvaggio,</I> 15 August 1927, the
<I>strapaesani</I>
insisted on
Mussolini's past as both a <I>selvaggio</I> and a
<I>vociano;</I> see
Mangoni,
<I>L'interventismo,</I> 146, 182, no. 109.

For several years, Maccari was an editor for Mussolini's
personal
newspaper,
<I>Il Popolo d'Italia.</I> Toward the end of the regime he
was appointed
professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome, and in
1941-42 he became
president
of the Sezione del Consiglio Superiore delle Arti (Section
of the Higher
Council
of the Arts). He was also the subject of a one-man show at
the 1939
Quadriennale.
See the biographical sketch written just months before the
fall of the
regime in
Mino Maccari, <I>Mino Maccari. Disegni ed incisioni e
documenti</I> (Rome:
Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne, 1943), 7-8.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT36" HREF="#REF36">36</a>.
This is the overall thesis of Mangoni,
<I>L'interventismo,</I> and
Giorgio
Luti, <I>La letteratura nel ventennio fascista</I>
(Florence: La Nuova
Italia,
1972).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT37" HREF="#REF37">37</a>.
Mussolini's original reads: "Io premio gli italiani che mi
dicono la
verit&agrave;, specialmente quando &egrave; amaro" (quoted
in Ragghianti,
<I>Il
Selvaggio,</I> 12).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT38" HREF="#REF38">38</a>.
The original reads: "cattolicismo, ruralismo, classicismo,
realismo,
gerarchia, autorit&agrave;" (Maccari, <I>Il Selvaggio,</I>
15 December
1927;
quoted in Mangoni, <I>L'interventismo,</I> 182, no. 105).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT39" HREF="#REF39">39</a>.
Soffici's ideas on Fascist culture are stated in "Il
Fascismo e
l'arte,"
<I>Gerarchia</I> (September 1922): 2-4, and "Arte fascista,"
<I>Critica
fascista,</I> 15 October 1926, 383-5.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT40" HREF="#REF40">40</a>.
Of Soffici's political allegiance, Renzo De Felice writes:
"it should
also be
said that he always remained a Fascist. To think that he
could become
anti-Fascist is absurd: it would have meant denying the
moral value that
the war
had held for him." (The original reads: "va per altro anche
detto che egli
rimase
sempre un fascista. Pensare che potesse diventare
antifascista &egrave; un
assurdo: avrebbe voluto dire negare il valore morale che per
lui aveva
avuto la
guerra," in Renzo De Felice, "Soffici, gli intellettuali e
il fascismo," in
<I>Ardengo Soffici,</I> 71.)

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT42" HREF="#REF42">42</a>.
See Adamson, <I>Avant-Garde Florence,</I> 227-34. Rosai was
also
associated
for a time with the nefarious re of Amerigo Dumini, a
leader among the
Florentine squads who later claimed responsibility for the
murder of the
Socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti. Soffici and Rosai both
contributed to
his
journal, <I>Sassaiola fiorentina,</I> which appeared from
1920 to 1923.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT43" HREF="#REF43">43</a>.
By 1921, Rosai began to distance himself from the Florentine
squads in
the
wake of their escalating violence, now directed against the
workers
themselves.
He took a more decisive step away at the time of the
Matteotti murder
(hanging
protest posters during the night, creating a disturbance at
the local
Fascist
headquarters, and warning potential victims of thugs on the
way). As
Giuseppe
Nicoletti writes, however, his participation

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
did not entail for Rosai a conversion to militant
anti-Fascism--the ideals
and
the political culture thatwere expressed through
anti-Fascism were too
remote for
him--but it represented a gesture of private rebellion and
subversive
sympathy
for a spirited minority, and it virtually signified his
wish, now that all
illusions had been stripped away, to disavow the
'revolutionary' passion
of the
returning ex-soldier, passion that had been so poorly
expended.

(The original reads: "non comport&ograve; per Rosai una
conversione
all'antifascismo militante [troppo estranei essendo per lui
la cultura
politica e
gli ideali che attraverso l'antifascismo si esprimevano] ma
rappresent&ograve; un
gesto di ribellione privata e di simpatia sovversiva per una
minoranza
animosa e
signific&ograve; quasi la volont&agrave; di sconfessare, ora
che tutte le
illusioni sembravano cadere, la malriposta passione
'rivoluzionaria' del

1990], 18.)

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT44" HREF="#REF44">44</a>.
<I>Il Bargello</I> was the weekly political and cultural
journal of the
Federazione provinciale fascista fiorentina, founded by
Alessandro
Pavolini,
which published between 1929 and 1943. The majority of
Rosai's drawings
appeared
in 1929-30, though he continued to illustrate for the
journal until the
mid-1930s. <I>Il Bargello</I> was faithful to the municipal
politics of
Fascism,
and it did not use regionalism as a pretext for critique as
did
<I>Strapaese.</I>
The cultural pages, however, took greater liberties with the
party line,
and were
European and modern in outlook. See Giuseppe Nicoletti,
"Rosai e 'Il
Bargello,'"
in <I>Ottone Rosai,</I> 33-37.

portrait of
Morandi by
Maccari which accompanied his autobiographical essay had
been previously
published in <I>Il Selvaggio,</I> 30 July 1927. The
Bolognese Giorgio Pini
participated in the squads, became editor of <I>Il Popolo

1936,
and adhered to the Republic of Sal&ograve;. In 1929
Longanesi became the
editor
of <I>L'Assalto;</I> see Cavallo, <I>"A Prato,"</I> 98.

<p>

The original reads: "Ebbi molta fede nel Fascismo fin dai
primi
accenni, fede
che non mi venne mai meno, neppure nei giorni pi&ugrave;
grigi e
tempestosi." The
choice of the word "faith," which Morandi emphasizes, is
particularly
loaded in
the context of the time, for it was a term officially linked
to the fascist
ideology, with its origins in <I>diciannovismo.</I> As
Emilio Gentile
states: "In
a certain sense, it is correct to state that, for Fascism,
the essence,
foundation and aim of political activity could be summed up
by the key
word in
Fascist language--'faith'" (Gentile, "Fascism as Political
Religion," 238).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT49" HREF="#REF49">49</a>.
In 1919, Soffici was encouraged by de Chirico and
Carr&agrave; to
follow
Morandi's work, and in the following year he noted Morandi
as an
up-and-coming
painter in <I>La Vraie Italie,</I> a Florentine journal
published in
French by
the former <I>vociano</I> Papini. The first surviving letter
from Morandi
to
Soffici dates from November 1923. On their relationship and
correspondance
see
Cavallo, <I>"A Prato."</I>

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT50" HREF="#REF50">50</a>.
See A. Beccaria, "Visita a Giorgio Morandi," <I>Nuova
Antologia</I>
(February
1964); quoted in Cavallo, <I>"A Prato,"</I> 5. As early as
1927, in his
autobiographical essay published in <I>L'Assalto</I> (see
note 45), Morandi
declared his admiration for Soffici, echoing Maccari's
statement that "The
work
of Soffici is of the sort that cannot be forgotten; his
influence on the
mind of
our generation has been enormous and beneficial." (The
original reads:
"L'opera
di Soffici &egrave; di quelle che non si cancellano, la sua
influenza sullo
spirito della nostra generazione, grandissima e benefica,"
in <I>Il
Selvaggio,</I> 10 November 1925; reprinted in Mangoni,
<I>L'Interventismo,</I>
105.) Morandi also cited Carr&agrave; as an inspiration:
Carr&agrave;
contributed
to <I>Il Selvaggio,</I> but was not as strongly associated
with
<I>Strapaese</I>
as was Soffici. Nor did he cling so tenaciously to
regionalist identity: he
simultaneously pursued a national Fascist art represented by
monumental
painting,
which was an outgrowth of the <I>Novecento</I> movement. See
Massimo
Campigli,
Carlo Carr&agrave;, Achille Funi and Mario Sironi,
"Manifesto della pittura
murale," <I>La Colonna</I> (December 1933).

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT51" HREF="#REF51">51</a>.
See Cavallo, <I>"A Prato,"</I> 21. Cavallo unwittingly
described the
characters of the two artists in terms endearing to the
<I>Strapaese</I>
attitude:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Besides, the characters of Soffici and Morandi seem truly
those of days
gone by;
they were of a rigor and simplicity that were difficult to
emulate,
qualities
that had, at any rate, disappeared over time, along with the
wholly
spiritual
sense of mission and discipline with which they dedicated
themselves to
art.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In an attempt to account for their seeming political
differences, he
writes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Morandi was much less emotional than Soffici, much lessan
ardent
nationalist, and
scarcely as inclined to undertake political commitments;
Morandi must have
been
loved by Soffici precisely because he kept his distance from
these
passions,
because he was different, because he had a certain
idealistic superiority
like
that of Manzoni.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
(The original reads: "Del resto i ritratti di Soffici e
Morandi sembrano
davvero
di tempi remoti; semplicit&agrave; e rigore difficili da
tenere a modello,
ma
comunque andati smarriti con il senso che loro davano
all'arte in
qualit&agrave;
di missione e disciplina prima di tutto spirituale," and,
"Cos&igrave;
diverso
dall'emotivit&agrave; di Soffici, dal suo ardore
nazionalistico, dal suo
impegno
politico, Morandi doveva essere amato da Soffici proprio per
la sua
distanza da
queste passioni, per la sua differenza e superiorit&agrave;
'manzoniana,'"
in
Cavallo, "A Prato," 22.)

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT52" HREF="#REF52">52</a>.
Suspected of anti-Fascist activities (though there is no
evidence to
that
effect), Morandi was seized by the local secret police on 23
May 1943 and
was
incarcerated for around ten days. Ragghianti and others
associated with the
Partito d'Azione (the Action Party) were arrested at the
same time. I
thank Janet
Abramowicz for this information. According to Cavallo, he
was arrested
along with
friends from the anti-Fascist Giustizia e Libert&agrave;
movement (Justice
and
Liberty movement) and other Bolognese intellectuals; see
Cavallo, <I>"A
Prato,"</I> 23. Without going into great detail about the
circumstances of
his
arrest, Arcangeli elevates Morandi's solitude and stoicism
during the
German
occupation to mythic proportions; see Arcangeli, <I>Giorgio
Morandi,</I>
217-9.
By contrast, Soffici was arrested at the end of 1944 and set
to a
concentration
camp near Terni overseen by the Americans. In February 1946,
he was tried
for
collaboration "because of his writings exalting the
dictatorship" but was
absolved of the charges due to insufficient evidence
(Giuseppe Raimondi
and Luigi
Cavallo, <I>Ardengo Soffici</I> [Florence: Nuovedizioni E.
Vallecchi,
1967],
161).

<p>

The original reads: "esser solo capace di ordine vero chi ha

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT55" HREF="#REF55">55</a>.
In his autobiographical essay published in <I>L'Assalto</I>
(see note
45),
Morandi asserts: "Among the moderns, in my view, Corot,
Courbet, Fattori,
and
C&eacute;zanne are the most legitimate of the glorious
Italian tradition."

The original reads: "Voi sapete pure che io non ho mai messo

Florence where he

Cipriano Efisio Oppo was a painter, critic, and Fascist

The phrase "I don't give a damn" <I>(me ne frego)</I> was
used by
soldiers in
the war, and later associated with Mussolini. According to
Walter Adamson,
it
ultimately derived from a 1913 article by Papini in

The categories of rhopography and megalography are applied
by Norman
Bryson,
<I>Looking at the Overlooked. Four Essays on Still Life
Painting</I>
(Cambridge,
Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990), 60-95. Bryson notes
that the
categories
derive from Charles Sterling, <I>Still Life Painting: From
Antiquity to the
Twentieth Century</I> (New York: Harper and Row, 1981).
Interesting in this
regard is Bryson's brief discussion of Morandi; see
<I>Looking at the
Overlooked,</I> 97-98. He sees his work as exalting empty
space in
reaction to
the overabundance of commodities in the industrialized age.
While such
analysis
has the potential to be grounded in the specifics of Fascist
culture,
Bryson
reverts to a typically ahistorical, formalist reading:
"Modernist still
life
knows this space well: the work of Morandi (1890-1964) is
made up of such
vibrations in vacancy, of 'seeing solid in void and void in
solid,' and of
interresonating intervals eventually so fine that it takes a
lengthy
viewing to
analyse their discriminations" (Bryson, <I>Looking at the
Overlooked,</I>

Ragghianti defines the courageous political stance of the
journal
through the
personality of Maccari, distancing him from more
programmatic Fascists
such as
Soffici; see Ragghianti, <I>Il Selvaggio,</I> 9-35. A more
negative
opinion, in
direct response to Ragghianti's defense, is given by Maltese
in <I>Storia
dell'arte in Italia,</I> 337-40. Mangoni points out that
Ragghianti's
focus on
Maccari's caricatures lends itself, incorrectly, to
interpret <I>Il
Selvaggio</I>
as anti-Fascist. In her opinion, Maccari's desire to operate
as a
corrective
force, based on an anachronistic Fascism, was doomed to
failure; see
Mangoni,
<I>L'interventismo,</I> 143.

<p>
<I>The Pisan Cantos,</I> the poetic sequence that Pound
wrote while
incarcerated at an open-air military detention center near
Pisa in 1945,
has long been recognized as a landmark of modern poetry.
Since its
publication, though, the sequence has provoked two very
different
readings, apparently opposed and yet united in their
willingness to read
Pound's work as ideologically consistent. The <I>Pisan
Cantos</I> were
awarded the first Library of Congress Bollingen Award by a
panel of
internationally famous poets in 1949, and have since been
surrounded by
furor. An admitted fascist under indictment for treason
because of wartime
radio broadcasts made in support of the Axis cause, Pound
was being
honored for poems that lamented the passing of fascist and
Nazi
collaborators, and the general public rose up en masse. In
constructing a
defense of Pound, the Bollingen judges and an international
array of
prominent writers fell back on formalist criteria of poetic
value and
helped to forge a mandarin, politically conservative "New
Criticism" that
would dominate the next two decades of literary discourse
and ultimately
become the primary target of poststructuralist theory.

<p>
Other readers defended the <I>Pisan Cantos</I> by fashioning
a more
palatable reading of what the poems said; they pointed to
currents in the
text they associated with the lines "'Master thyself, then
others shall
thee beare' / Pull down thy vanity," and suggested that the
<I>Pisan
Cantos</I> dramatized a moving, albeit reluctant,
recantation of fascism.
In this view, the poems were defensible not only because of
their
technical brilliance, but also because they established a
new confessional
mode associated with a revolutionary technical openness and
a
hypersensitive 

<B></B>

 awareness of the
natural world. One contemporary reviewer,
Robert Fitzgerald, wrote that Pound had sounded "a personal
desolation"
and had achieved "a kind of repentance that is enormously
moving."
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
In the wake of this and similar responses, <I>The
Pisan Cantos</I> cast a long shadow over the poetry of the
next twenty
years, whether it was the confessional verse of Robert
Lowell or the less
intimate meditations of Charles Olson. Anchoring Pound's
influence was a
perception that <I>The Pisan Cantos</I> were confessions
wrung out of a
repentant fascist by a dark night of the soul and the
healing force of
nature: spontaneous utterance and an apparent return to
natural simplicity
had given Pound's words a special authenticity, an immediacy
that was
hailed as the <I>ne plus ultra</I> of poetic modernism.

<p>
Critics have since questioned the sincerity of Pound's
"repentance" as
they have recognized obvious strains of undiminished fascist
loyalty in
the poem. And recently they have begun to question more than
that. For the
issue of Pound's contrition has been seen by
poststructuralists as related
to the way modernist poetry's "immediacy" authorizes
factitious
mystifications of language and nature. The strong version of
this position
argues for a necessary connection between the modernist
manner of <I>The
Pisan Cantos,</I> its naturalization of experience, and the
fascist
politics of its author.

<p>
With so much at stake, questions about how <I>The Pisan
Cantos</I> were
written take on a special interest. Do, for example, the
facts of the
work's composition match the account of spontaneous
utterance that Pound
had advanced and that even his critics have assumed? A
decade after their
publication Ezra Pound wrote to a friend that all the
"Pisans" were done
at Pisa, that "not more than three lines" changed
afterwards.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
That is not, however, the story his manuscripts
tell. Writing the <I>Pisan Cantos</I> was a protracted,
complex, and
fractured process. The actual composition took place in
three distinct
stages, each corresponding with changes in Pound's
circumstances, his
self-assessment, and his political outlook. First, while
still residing in
Sant'Ambrogio and months before his imprisonment, Pound
began a series of
lyrical fragments that were overtly symbolist in style and
avowedly
fascist in viewpoint. Then, after circumstances had wrenched
him out of
his wartime retreat and into the prison camp in Pisa, his
manner and
subject changed. The literary model for his writing became a
realistic
poetic diary in the manner of Villon, and (though he
incorporated from
memory swatches of material from the earlier drafts) the
center of his
attention became the lives of the rough crew of soldiers
around him.
Having thus fashioned an uneasy mixture of very different
perspectives,
Pound believed that he had finished the poem, then suddenly
changed his
mind. Jolted by reports that close friends had died, and
increasingly
faced with the possibility that he himself might be
executed, he began
writing once more. In a surge of defensiveness, he imposed a
polemical
framework on the poem, which gave it a force and coloring
that often
contradicted what he had recently written.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Pound's
manuscripts thus suggest a history that unfolded not in one
aesthetic and
ideological context, but in several. Consequently,
interpreting <I>The
Pisan Cantos</I> involves choosing among conflicting
authorial signals and
presents a dilemma that may be insoluble. To recognize as
much, however,
can clarify some of our currently vexed interrogations of
modernism.

I. Background
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Ezra Pound's attraction to Italian Fascism was from the
beginning both
representative and bizarre. One of many prominent
intellectuals whose
cultural politics shifted after World War I from anarchist
sympathies to a
yearning for order, Pound moved in 1924 from Paris to the
English resort
town Rapallo, attracted at least in part by Mussolini's
vision of a
transformed Italy. Pound's enthusiasm for Mussolini was
shared in the
mid-1920s by voices as disparate as George Bernard Shaw and
<I>The New
Republic,</I> but as time passed and the Italian regime
suffered the
crises of the Matteoti murder , the Italian invasion
of Ethiopia
, the alliance between Germany and Italy, and the
resulting
promulgation, against the Italian grain, of racial laws
directed against
Jews , Mussolini's foreign sympathizers dwindled. Yet
Pound's
support continued. Where others saw repression, Pound
(encouraged by
fascist propaganda) continued to believe in the construction
of a society
free of the class hostilities that plagued both capitalism
and communism,
and in Mussolini's ability to allocate the economic goods of
the modern
world for the common good. Above all, Pound understood
Mussolini as the
creator of a Sorelian myth of the future strong enough to
recreate Italian
society. Mussolini's promises dovetailed with Pound's own
political and
economic idealism, and his attempt to refashion Italian
society through
the irrational energies of political myth answered to the
ambitions of all
Futurist art to revolutionize human consciousness. For
Pound, Mussolini
was an "artifex" ("take him as anything but an artist and
you will get
muddled with contradictions"), and in the deepest recesses
of his
imagination he associated Mussolini's revolutionary rhetoric
with
Jefferson, who had envisioned for America the renewals of
periodic
revolution, and with the transcendentalists, who had urged
the American
self periodically to revolutionize the world through the
individual
imagination.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
The politics of Pound's <I>Cantos,</I> an epic of cultural
values begun
well before the advent of fascism, could not help but
register the
political evolution of its creator. When young, Pound had
espoused "a
downright rejection of the bourgeois conception of family,"
but "from his
early forties to his early seventies he gradually went over
to advocating
[a patriarchalism that] passes for Confucianism."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
So before
1920 Pound had made the adventurer Odysseus the first
protagonist of his
many-voiced poem; but by the 1930s he was transferring his
praise from
what he then called "the maritime adventure morals of
Odysseus" to Rome
("the responsible ruler") and "the need for coordination of
individuals
expressed in Kung's [Confucius's] teaching."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
As World War II approached, Pound's situation grew
increasingly brittle
and precarious, and his long poem lost even its revised
direction. By the
end of the 1930s, he wished to bring his modern
<I>Commedia</I> to a
paradisal conclusion, but the time was not auspicious.
Sensing the
outbreak of the war, he inserted one more installment on
politics (Cantos
52-71) to constellate what he thought of as an ideogram of
strong
government at a moment when Europe was falling apart. In
1939 he briefly
visited Washington D.C. in an attempt to influence the
senators he had
been corresponding with for years to avoid a war between
America and the
Axis, then returned to 

<B></B>

 Italy before
the hostilities started. In January
1941 he began making radio broadcasts from Rome which were
sponsored by
the Italian propaganda ministry and shrieked his
frustrations over the
airwaves. Finally in December 1941 he made the fateful
decision to
continue the broadcasts after America entered the war.

<p>
Pound was indicted for treason on 26 July 1943, the day
after the king of
Italy, following the lead of the Fascist Grand Council,
removed Mussolini
as head of the Italian government. In early September, when
Marshall
Badoglio announced Italy's surrender to the Allies and the
Germans
responded by moving south to retake Rome, Hitler rescued
Mussolini and set
him up as the leader of the so-called Repubblica Sociale
Italiana (RSI) or
Sal&ograve; Republic. At the time, Pound was staying in a
Rome that had
been reduced to chaos. No one knew who would control the
city, nor what
the consequences would be. Fearing for his life, he made a
desperate
journey to the Tyrol, where his daughter lived, and
gradually returned via
Lake Garda and meetings with representatives of the RSI to
an even more
precarious life back in Rapallo. But his life and the
writing that grew
out of it came increasingly to lament a world in ruins and
to seek
consolation in a landscape suffused with ghostly presences.

<p>
By late 1944 Pound was almost without money and increasingly
dependent on
work he did for the RSI's Ministry of Popular Culture. This
work was
regarded by the U.S. as part of its evidence for Pound's
treason, and it
must also count as evidence of his fascist literary
leanings. But the
evidence is strange. As Tim Redman has pointed out, in
February 1944, when
Pound wrote to Nino Sammartano (inspector of the radio for
the RSI) to
propose a list of translations that Mussolini's government
should support,
the list included e. e. cummings's <I>Eimi</I>, Joyce's
<I>Ulysses</I>,
and Stalin's <I>The Bases of Leninism</I> ("a magnificent
slashing
criticism of the Roosevelt-Churchillian scum").
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
The next
month he added something equally odd but much closer to his
current
interests, the translation of Confucius into Italian, with
two aims:
"first: instruction in philosophy; second: commerce with the
Chinese as a
manner of understanding what the Nipponese are and on what
they base their
culture."
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
And although the Japanese, as Emilio Gentile has
noted, had even before the war become a model for how the
Italian Fascists
could utilize ancient traditions in a revolutionary way,
Pound's proposal
to translate Confucius in order to advance the Axis war
effort was a very
peculiar business.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Redman comments that Pound was "following
his own program at least as much as a program for Italian
propaganda," and
implies that he was exploiting his paymasters in a
commendable
way.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
But it was more likely that Pound genuinely believed
that Confucianism, which he had paired with the American
tradition in
Cantos 52-71, genuinely shared the cultural ethos of
revolutionary fascism.

<p>
Meanwhile the war was drawing near its conclusion. In the
spring of 1944
the Allies captured Rome, and then, as the primary front
shifted to
France, allowed the Italian campaign to stall just north of
Tuscany. (They
took Pisa, for example, but did not bother with Liguria.)
Yet the
destruction had been immense. Towns like Rapallo were bombed
insistently,
and slowly but surely many of the art treasures of Northern
Italy were
damaged. On Sunday, 4 June 1944, Pound read in the
<I>Corriere della
Serra</I> 

<B></B>

 that bombs had severely
damaged the Tempio Malatestiano in
Rimini, his touchstone of Renaissance civilization and the
power of the
human imagination to renew itself.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Pound's personal life was
touched by an almost equally ominous disruption--in May he
and his wife
Dorothy were forced to vacate their apartment by the
seashore and move to
a house on the cliffs of Sant'Ambrogio with Olga Rudge, with
whom Pound
had been carrying on a relationship for almost twenty years;
the
Sant'Ambrogio house witnessed but could barely contain the
running
friction between the two women he loved.

<p>
From then on, if we are to judge by the poetry he wrote,
Pound's state of
mind, strained by his domestic relations, swung between
defiant denial and
a passivity bordering on the feeling of an afterlife. The
defiance appears
in the Italian Cantos 72 and 73, whispered about for years
and finally
published for the first time in the U.S. in 1987.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
They were
written in response to two events. On 16 December 1944,
Mussolini made
what was to be his last public speech, a stirring appeal for
patriotic
efforts to stop the Allied forces, which ended with a call
for a
<I>riscossa,</I> a counterattack. Four days earlier, on 12
December, the
Futurist poet and ardent Fascist F. T. Marinetti had died,
and the
combination of the two events spurred Pound into writing. He
attempted his
new cantos in Italian and they express their fascist
loyalties in the
baldest way imaginable.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Canto 73 represents the exultation
of Guido Cavalcanti, who has returned from the sphere of
Venus to witness
the heroism of a young girl who sacrificed her life for her
country by
leading Canadian soldiers who had raped her into a
minefield. The canto
enacts the Fascist ritual of celebrating martyrs of the
"faith," as does
Canto 72, originally entitled "Presenza!," echoing the
Fascist call to
order and recalling the word "Presente," inscribed one
thousand times
around the Sacrarium of the Fascist Martyrs at the center of
the 1932
<I>Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution</I> in Rome.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Canto
72 depicts the appearance of Marinetti's spirit, who asks to
appropriate
Pound's body so that Marinetti can continue to t in the
war.
Marinetti, though, is displaced by Pound's friend Manlio
Torquato Dazzi,
and then by the ferocious re of Ezzelino da Romano, the
early
thirteenth-century Ghibillene whom Dante sees boiling among
the tyrants of
<I>Inferno</I> XII. It is in Ezzelino's suitably enraged
voice that Pound
calls for the damnation of treacherous Italian peacemakers
and for the
revenge of the monuments at Rimini.

<p>
Having drafted the two poems in a notebook, along with still
more
materials in Italian, Pound published a fragment of Canto 72
and all of 73
in a newspaper addressed to sailors in the navy of the
Sal&ograve;
Republic. Even before they were printed he had gone on with
Italian
sequels, drafts that contain visionary moments on which
Pound would draw
that summer in writing the Pisan Cantos.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The Italian work,
which was evidently abandoned after several months and
includes
manuscripts and multiple typescripts, begins with a
visionary meeting on
the hillside near Sant'Ambrogio with "la scalza," a barefoot
girl, and her
companions.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
The visionary troupe includes Cunizza da Romano,
the sister of the tyrant Ezzelino who had been courted by
the troubadour
poet Sordello.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Cunizza (Pound believed) spent her old age in
the house of Guido Cavalcanti when Dante was a young boy, so
transmitting 

<B></B>

the lyrical power of Provence to Italy.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Pound's setting is
the gulf of Liguria, a scene of steep cliffs, climbing olive
groves, and
natural beauties. In one typescript, Pound speaks of hearing
"the ancient
voices" <I>("le vetuste voc[i]")</I> louder than ever before
<I>("pi&ugrave; che mai prima"),</I> "clear and more
frequent" <I>("chiare
e pi&ugrave; sovente").</I> As the world falls apart around
him, he
reassures himself that these ancient voices represent a
paradisal bedrock
in human experience which cannot be destroyed. And in the
hillside
typescript, he portrays this ancient wisdom emanating from
the re of
Cunizza, who appears at the crossing of three paths (the
<I>triedro)</I>
near an olive grove. There, her hair shining with copper and
gold, she
defends her ferocious brother. Yet what she says is less
important than
the effect she makes, for in these texts Pound does his best
to reproduce
the atmospherics he admired in Dante's <I>Paradiso.</I>
Cunizza is
followed by another apparition, Isotta degli Atti, the lover
of Sigismondo
Malatesta who had reportedly inspired him to build the
Tempio
Malatestiano, and she is compared with a chrysalis the color
of light.
Isotta and Cunizza blend with the moonlit landscape and,
with other
res like themselves, fashion a compound presence both
intercessor and
spirit of place--a sometimes queen, sometimes waif whom
Pound frequently
addresses as "la luna" (the moon). An apparent embodiment of
charity or
compassion, this visionary presence is unthinkable apart
from art and
poetry, and she appeals to us aesthetically rather than
morally. This is
hardly surprising in Pound, who ordinarily thinks of
morality as an
outgrowth of intense perception. But it does represent an
extremely
delicate, even precarious experience on which to base the
kind of
judgments Pound soon found himself wanting to make.

II. Pisa: First Impulses (June-July 1945)
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The verses of these Italian Cantos 74 and 75 were still in
Pound's head
when in May, four months later and with the Allies in
control of Italy, he
was captured and nearly killed by marauding partisans, then
released. He
turned himself in to the American army and after three weeks
of
bureaucratic shuffle was incarcerated. Treated as a possible
target of
rescue by remaining Fascists, Pound, aged nearly sixty, was
held for three
weeks (from 24 May to 15 June) in a wire cage exposed to the
elements in
the U.S. Army Disciplinary Training Center (DTC) outside
Pisa. Shattered
by the exposure to intense summer weather and by solitary
confinement, he
suffered a breakdown. He was released from the cage and
moved to the
Center's medical compound, where he occupied an officer's
tent and
acquired a packing crate table, together with some pencils
and writing
pads; now he set about composing the poem that would make
his postwar
reputation.

<p>
Pound's manuscript comprises the first text of <I>The Pisan
Cantos</I>
proper (Cantos 74-84), and at this point two things about it
are worth
noting. First, it is a distinct version of the text,
containing much that
was later omitted. Second, it is conditioned in crucial ways
by the
earlier typescripts of the Italian Cantos 74 and 75 and
their related
manuscripts, from which he borrowed freely. The Canto 74
that he finally
published, for example, returns several times to a visionary
encounter
with Cunizza 

<B></B>

 at the crossing of the
three paths ("al Triedro"), and with
her companion who whispers "I am the moon" ("Io son' la
Luna"). And the
first page of Canto 76 as published retains a passage every
element of
which had been sketched out in Italian earlier in the year:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Beyond these linguistic holdovers, however, it is apparent
that Pound's
manuscript carries on the otherworldly mood of his Italian
verses, and
like them aestheticizes his experience. The re of "the
barefoot girl,"
though sometimes shading into the Virgin Mary, derives from
his thinking
about the troubadours and Cavalcanti. As in his famous
translation of
"Donna mi prega," he celebrates a love that does not take
"delight" in its
object but "in the being aware." He understands, he tells us
elsewhere,
the true "matter of Dante's <I>paradiso</I>" to be not moral
philosophy,
but rather "the glass under water, the form that seems a
form seen in a
mirror," and similar "realities perceptible to [heightened]
sense." And,
he says, he admires Cavalcanti in some ways more than Dante,
because,
being a "natural" rather than a "moral" philosopher, a
thinker more like
Erigena than Virgil, Cavalcanti treats this "matter" more
intensely.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>
It is in the spirit of these remarks that the manuscript
text of <I>The
Pisan Cantos</I> begins. Most strikingly, the draft starts
with the verses
that now appear at lines ten and eleven--"The suave eyes,
quiet, not
scornful, / rain also is of the process." Here Pound
telescopes a vision
of the <I>stilnovisti</I> beloved with a mystical reading of
Confucius
very like the one that concludes his contemporary
translation of the
<I>Unwobbling Pivot:</I> "The <I>unmixed</I> functions (in
time and space)
without bourne. This unmixed is the tensile light, the
Immaculata. There
is no end to its action."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
"The suave eyes," then, initiate a
poem whose theme is meant to involve the redeeming energies
of light and
reason, and whose essential shape unfolds in intuitions of
Aphrodite that
prepare us for the appearance of "pale eyes as if without
fire" in Canto
80, for the subtle eyes without anger in Canto 81 (in
carnival mask as
were 

<B></B>

 Cunizza's eyes in the Italian
cantos), and ultimately for Canto 83,
in which other eyes, Pound exults, "pass and look
<I>from</I> mine."

<p>
Which is to say that in its thematic contours the longhand
text of <I>The
Pisan Cantos</I> is not radically different from certain
currents of the
published text, at least as it has been interpreted since
the
1950s.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
And yet, in light of the fascist fury of the Italian
Cantos 72 and 73 and of the visions of the Italian Cantos 74
and 75, this
first English version of the work has a very different feel.
Pound, we can
now see, did not discover the eyes that <I>The Pisan
Cantos</I> celebrate
in the Pisan landscape, nor did they enter his consciousness
either
because of his bitter incarceration or due to the kindness
of his fellow
inmates. He had them already in mind, and he used them to
filter his
experience, which helps to explain a nagging dissonance in
the poem. The
goddesses of <I>The Pisan Cantos</I> are disconcertingly
slight in
relation to the depth of experience we find in Pound's more
genuine
moments. They are also oddly disengaged from it: they tend
to appear in
histrionic, even sentimental passages that speak of ecstacy,
whereas the
poem's great moments invoke human sympathy; and yet Pound
calls on their
force and counsel to justify a jeremiad against his accusers
and the
modern world.

<p>
This dissonance corresponds to another off-note, the way the
sequence
emphasizes endearing glimpses of nature. Pound's disciplined
concentration
on the natural object had made his reputation, of course,
and <I>The Pisan
Cantos,</I> in manuscript as in publication, boast a number
of celebrated
examples. Pound himself even calls attention to their
importance when,
near the end of Canto 78, he remarks, "as for the solidity
of the white
oxen in all this / perhaps only Dr. Williams (Bill Carlos) /
will
understand its importance, / its benediction. He wd / have
put in the
cart." But Pound's use of the word "benediction" should make
us pause. The
white oxen here, along with the many small creatures that
subsequently
appear in the sequence (the katydid, Madame Vespa the wasp,
and the green
midge half the size of an ant), are agents of that same
force that flowed
through Cunizza--a force that had more to do with beauty and
power than
with human fellowship. So in <I>The Pisan Cantos,</I> the
resurgent power
of nature that in Canto 83 insures that the "mint springs up
again / in
spite of Jones's rodents" is directly related to what in
Pound's winter
manuscripts transcended the rubble of the war and whispered
"voices /
clear and more frequent." The small creatures, on which so
much of the
poem's message depends, belong to a force as preliminary to
Pound's Pisan
experience as <I>la luna</I> (the moon). Instead of
instancing unbidden
interruptions of the untainted here and now, they manifest
power that
Pound equates with ancient discourse and characterizes in
terms of a
Confucian "process" that he unselfconsciously turns to
political purposes.

<p>
No less than in Emerson or Thoreau, in other words, nature
in <I>The Pisan
Cantos</I> confronts an isolated man that he may teach what
appears to be
a timeless lesson. And especially as in Thoreau, whom Pound
had praised in
the early 1940s, the timeless lesson bears an undercurrent
of very timely
politics. In the writing of Thoreau and Emerson, nature
appears as a
polemical counter in a campaign of cultural resistance to
the exchange
relationships of modern industrial life. And in the "Baker

<B></B>

 Farm" section
of Thoreau's <I>Walden,</I> Thoreau throws in relief both
the natural
world and "the only true America" by means of an ugly
portrait of an Irish
family identified with life in the marketplace. At Pisa,
Pound replicates
the same discourse, substituting Jews for Thoreau's Irish.
What nature
tells him has the force of a political jeremiad, only it now
resonates not
only with the politics of American nativism but with the
politics of
fascism, which sees marketplace capitalism as the primary
hindrance to the
emergence of a revolutionary new society. And no less than
in
<I>Walden'</I>s nostalgia for an America that has passed,
Pound's elegy
turns frequently sour.

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

III. Pisa: New Beginnings (July-September 1945)
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Yet along with the carryovers from the 1945 Italian Cantos,
the
maunuscript text of <I>The Pisan Cantos</I> also marks the
emergence of a
second poetic idiom, a major change in poetic practice that
runs counter
to the Italian drafts' symbolism. When Pound started writing
in the
medical compound, he proceeded as if he were keeping a
poetic diary,
combining narrative with observation and starting from a
very specific
moment. The earliest event he identifies was the hanging of
a fellow
prisoner, Louis Till, on 2 July 1945. Near the beginning of
Canto 74 Pound
records that "Till was hung yesterday," and in another
manuscript passage
a few pages later he inserts the date "July 6th."

<p>
The material's diary-like texture is reinforced by the first
use Pound
made of it. When he was at last permitted to write to his
wife Dorothy, he
sent her fragments of his work in place of substantive
communication. The
first of these enclosures consisted of what would later
become the suite's
most famous lines ("Pull down thy vanity"). In his
accompanying note,
dated 23 September, Pound said that he was sure the lines
would be "more
human than a dull letter," and added that they were "mild"
enough for his
mother to see.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Such was the first context of Canto 81, but
it would not be the last.

<p>
Pound initially assumed he would preface the sequence with
the already
drafted Italian Cantos 74 and 75, for the manuscript refers
to what is now
Canto 75 as "Canto LXXVII" and what is now Canto 76 as
"Canto LXXVIII." By
2 October, though--a sign of his change in practice--he
tentatively
decided to forget about the Italian manuscripts, and he
wrote Dorothy "I
have done a Decad 74/83, which dont seem any worse than the
first 70." He
also seems to have been quite definite that Canto 83 would
be the last,
because on 4 October he instructs her to sound out T. S.
Eliot about
publishing "cantos 72 or 74 to 83."

<p>
By the onset of his composition at Pisa, then, and lasting
until a point
when <I>The Pisan Cantos</I> as we know them had reached an
advanced
state, Pound's preoccupation with goddesses and katydids was
overshadowed
by concern with the fate of the people he knew and the
affections of the
family he was writing for. The diary-like openness of the
text also
indicates that he was less certain of where he would start
and where he
would end than his visionary structure would suggest. Which
helps put, I
believe, the Pisan landscape in context different from
either the
sentimental 

<B></B>

 or the ideological reading
mentioned above. A note from
Dorothy to Pound before she had read any of the Pisans is of
use. On 25
September, Dorothy, unsure that Pound would ever receive her
message,
wrote, "Should this reach you.--You may imagine that I am
thinking of you
all the time: but I do not worry all that time. I only hope
captivity is
not proving bad for your health, &amp; that you are able to
work at some
writing or other. The moment perhaps for those 'Memoirs'
[struck by Dorothy in note] 'Memories'?"

<p>
The word "Memories" here has Dorothy's quotes around it, and
points to the
fact that the two of them had already discussed the
possibility of a work
about Pound's life. That explains why, on 13 October, having
seen parts of
Cantos 74, 76, 80 and 81, she writes with the delight of a
prophet
confirmed (and then with a nagging reservation about the use
of private
experience): "Of course," she exclaims, "all these last,
apparantly,
scraps, of cantos, are your self, the memories that make up
yr. person."
But she adds: "Is one then only a bunch of memories? i.e. a
bunch of
remains of contacts with the other people?"

<p>
Considering how charged issues of memory had become for
Pound, Dorothy's
questions would have been haunting. In the account of his
American lawyer,
Julien Cornell:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
after a week or so of the mental and physical torment of
confinement in
the cage, Pound's mind gave way. He says that he can now
recall only the
sensation that the top of his head was empty; also that his
eyebrows were
constantly taut in a raised position, due to the heat and
glare. . . . he
was stricken with violent terror and hysteria, and also
affected with
amnesia.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The amnesia, it seems, was most terrifying of all. As he
told Jerome
Kavka, the young therapist assigned to his case in his early
days at St.
Elizabeths, he felt he had "burst a mainspring at Pisa." And
although, as
Kavka noted, it seems that Pound "deplored the
psychoanalytic method"
partially because "it would bring up too many painful
memories," when his
mind went at Pisa, Pound was desperate to remember so that
he could
maintain his self-esteem.
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
(As late as February 1946 he would
movingly complain to James Laughlin from St. Elizabeths that
as he was no
longer required to "THINK anymore [I] shall be happy when I
begin (i.e.
IF) to remember.")
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Whatever his conflicted feelings about them, at Pisa Pound
did write his
"Memories," and in them he resurrected persons young and
old, famous and
obscure. And it is the exercise of this remembering, working
with and
against a sensitized response to the landscape, that gives
these cantos a
place on our shelves. Although there are ugly blinkers on
Pound's
sympathy, they ultimately seem forgivable because of the
generous way he
remembers the dead.

<p>
Nor did his exercise lack an appropriate literary frame. As
Achilles Fang
observed in the late 1950s, Pound's rememberings derive
precedent and
structure from a work he had for many years praised and
imitated. In 1921,
Pound had used Francois Villon's "Grand Testament" for an
opera. Now,
fearing he might succeed Till on the gallows, he imagines
himself with
Villon "under <I>les six potences."</I> Hence a great deal

<B></B>

 of <I>The Pisan
Cantos</I> can be construed as an elaboration of the
"Testament"'s stanza
29: "Where are those laughing comrades / that I was with in
former days, /
who sang so well, talked so well / and so excelled in word
and deed? /
Some are dead and stiff--/ nothing now remains of them: /
may they find
peace in Paradise, / and may God save the rest."
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
Pound, though, did not simply reproduce Villon's recitation
of legacies.
Concen-trating on those cries in the last extremity that
punctuate
Villon's tough humor, the <I>Pisan Cantos</I> throughout
associate memory
with broken pride, forgiveness, unconscious intensity, and
tears.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
And though it may be argued that Pound's tears
started out in self-pity, very early in the composition they
become fused
with the kind of compassion that (like the sunset in
<I>Purgatorio</I>
VIII that Canto 74 quotes) "softens" ("ch'intenerisce") the
heart. Like a
mantra that sidesteps psychic resistance and discovers
sympathetic powers
beyond the ego, Pound's mnemonic exercise, he tells us,
restored his power
to feel. In his words it bathed the "dust and glare evil" of
his
confinement with a fountain of self-forgetful reminiscence.
And he
recorded the experience with gratitude. So in Canto 74,
shortly after the
echo of Dante's sunset, "the tides [that] follow Lucina"
remind him "that
[he] had been a hard man in some ways / a day as a thousand
years." And in
Canto 80, Villon's plea, "repos donnez a cils," unleashes
Pound's
answering French: "Les larmes que j'ai cr&eacute;es
m'inondent / Tard,
tr&egrave;s tard je t'ai connue, La Tristesse / I have been
hard as youth
sixty years."

<p>
This confession, validated by Pound's frequent testimonials
to the dead,
acquires increasing poignancy in the text preserved in the
manuscript,
and, parallel with the orchestrations of nature and
Aphrodite, culminates
in Pound's intended conclusion. Canto 83 starts with Eregina
and light but
finds its completion in <I>hudor</I>--water in the form of
mist, rain, and
tears. It is perhaps most poignant in Pound's memory of H.
D., the dryad
"whose eyes are like the clouds over Taishan / When some of
the rain has
fallen / and half remains yet to fall." But the Canto is
almost as moving
in its filial close, where Pound gives voice to his elderly
mother and his
late Aunt Frank. Their recollections reach back "40 years,
60 years?" to
another era.
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, against the grain of the autograph manuscript's
visionary and
mystified symbolic structure, but reinforced by the
fragmentary movement
of the <I>Cantos'</I> modernist narrative idiom, Pound had
superimposed on
the Dantescan epic model he had followed from the mid-1920s
the lyric,
episodic model of Villon. The <I>Testament'</I>s generic
pull toward open
lyric progression proved ideal for recording the flow of
Pound's
day-to-day memories, perceptions, and activities. And
Villon's ideological
coordinates reinforced some of the poem's prefascist
sources--an
identification, for example, with the outlaw instead of the
governor, the
renegade instead of the policeman, the bohemian instead of
the courtier.

IV. Pisa: The Final Revisions (October-November 1945)
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
However, the composition of the <I>Pisan Cantos</I> did not
fully conform
even to the altered premises just described, premises that
fueled the poem
until 4 October 1945 

<B></B>

 when Pound still
intended to make Canto 83 the last
poem in his new sequence. On 5 October, once again the
Cantos were
wrenched into another course. On that day Dorothy was
allowed to visit for
the first time and she now reported to Pound the news that
the poet J. P.
Angold had died. As Pound wrote on 8 October, he was
heartbroken; Angold
had been the "best granite" of his poetic generation. On the
same day
Pound began an unforeseen Canto 84 with a cry of grief. He
continued in
the same vein after 17 October with farewells to the
collaborators Laval
and Quisling, an angry lament for a new set of "martyrs."
Also after the
17th, he began heavily revising earlier parts of the poem.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Pound was unsure about the appropriateness of Canto 84,
though, and both
his manuscript and typescript contain several pages dated 11
November that
he finally removed.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Only his departure from the DTC seems to
have ended his postscripts. He was without warning removed
for transfer to
Washington at half past eight in the evening on 16 November
1945, and on 4
December Dorothy received the rest of his typescript.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
Parts of Canto 84 were fully of a piece with what he had
already written.
Its finale, for instance, was genuinely moving, though
off-balance. In
lines he later excised, he laments (as one critic has said
he does in
<I>The Pisan Cantos</I> as a whole) "the errors his personal
life,"
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
and he uncomfortably recalls the two women his
domestic arrangements had grieved ("I know I ask a great
deal").
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Yet this conclusion was not what his heartsick anger
wanted to say. The most dramatic evidence of Pound's mood
during these
weeks and the keynote of the third distinct stage of <I>The
Pisan
Cantos</I> text forms a fitting counterpart to the Canto 84
he had just
composed. The famous opening elegy to Mussolini, which seems
to give
<I>The Pisan Cantos</I> so much of their characteristic
tone, was an
afterthought. I give the passage as it appears on Pound's
first
typescript:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

 

<p>
These lines, far from being the originating kernel of the
suite, in fact
surfaced slowly. Pound made notes for the verses about Manes
and the city
of Dioce as early as July; sometime later he wrote out a
version without
Dioce but including the dream, Benito and La Clara; and
still later, he
recopied the lines on a leaf between pages ninety-one and
ninety-two of
the Canto 74 manuscript and typed them, still without Dioce,
onto a
separate sheet.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
We know that he did not insert them into the
text even in early October from the evidence of the
typewriters. Even
after he had retyped the first two-thirds of Canto 74
sometime after 17
October, the Mussolini lines had not yet been inserted. In
one late
typescript, Pound in fact had written an "incipit" next to
the "Canto ?74"
above the first lines of his text, lines that still began
"The suave eyes,
quiet, not scornful." It was likely among his last decisions
at Pisa to
affix the page with the lines on Mussolini, beginning "The
enormous
tragedy of the dream," adding in longhand "To build the city
of Dioce. . .
." Then and only then did he boldly pencil in page "1" and
with the same
pencil renumber pages one through nine.

<p>
But however belated, or rather precisely because belated,
Pound's new
opening pointed to the emergence of a distinctive version of
the text. By
which I mean not that he rewrote his poem, but rather that
he changed
enough cues to make what remained vibrate in a different
way. Together
with all the changes he had already made--the remembrances
of personal
friends he had excised from Canto 74; the political Canto 84
he had added
in October and November; his decision to cut the personal
ending of that
canto--the new opening lines transformed his elegy to a
destroyed world
into an explicitly political statement.

<p>
In Pound's completed typescript, it becomes difficult not to
read even
ambiguous passages along political lines. Thus the Confucian
references on
the first pages of Canto 74, which Pound had flavored with
Cavalcanti, now
seem primarily political, as were the Confucian Cantos
52-61. Think of
"what whiteness will you add to this whiteness, / what
candor?" Pound had
originally found the question in Mencius, where it is asked
by a disciple
after Confucius's death, and he quoted it in an unpublished
1941 fragment
at Yale.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
But in its new surroundings, the question is hard
to dissociate from the death of Mussolini, which took place
on 28 April
1945. Or consider, one line before it, "What you depart from
is not the
way," which was suggested by a discussion of process in
<I>The Unwobbling
Pivot.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
We can read the words as a self-accusation,
meaning roughly: "adversity has shown me problems in my way
of living; and
so my old life could not have been the way." And in fact
Pound had first
written on his manuscript "what is left is not the way."
With the new
opening of Canto 74, though, the line all but shouts: "I
know the way, and
I am not going to leave it."

<p>
Also, think about Pound's tone. The Mussolini lines send
<I>The Pisan
Cantos</I> in this third version on its way bristling with
self-protective
hostility. Reading quickly, we are likely to remember not
Pound's openness
or his generosity, but a "proud and intransigent . . .
stoicism" that
allows him "to control and order" chaos and despair.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
In this
mood nature sounds less like an unpredictable series of
quotidian miracles 

<B></B>

than a force allied with Pound and eager to rebuke their
common enemies.
Nor can he afford to sympathize with America in this version
of the poem.
And so in a truncated Canto 81 his emphasis now shifts from
vision to
admonition, and Pound's possessed voice cries out, in Peter
D'Epiro's
words, against "the empty pride of his victorious captors
(and the nation
they serve, along with its self-righteous artists)"
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>:

V. Conclusion
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
I wish to conclude, however, with a caution not to emphasize
the
<I>ressentiment</I> of this outcry too much. Because of the
succeeding
frames that Pound incorporated into the manuscript and
typescript texts of
<I>The Pisan Cantos</I>, it seems to me that George Kearns
is as justified
arguing that Canto 81 is a "confession of [Pound's own]
failure and
vanity" as Peter D'Epiro is when he holds it confesses
nothing.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Pound provided encoded instructions for both, with
the result that neither reading by itself suffices. To
appropriate Jerome
McGann, in <I>The Pisan Cantos</I> as in <I>The Cantos</I>
as a whole
Pound left the telos of his writing indeterminate as he
composed, and he
thus opened it to contradictory interpretations. In McGann's
words, as the
poem's images succeed one another, each detached from
narrative support,
Pound's "discourse accumulates a structure that grows
increasingly
overdetermined." The result is that "every part becomes open
to invasion
from every other part."
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
What a given image signifies, then,
may change dramatically from year to year or, as in this
case, from month
to month. Thus the opening and conclusion of <I>The Pisan
Cantos,</I>
which seem unmistakably to announce the fascist sympathies
of the suite as
a whole, are in fact late additions to a work whose earlier
impulses had
been decidedly mixed. It is true that the belated opening
and conclusion
resonate with the mourning of fascist martyrs in Cantos 72
and 73, but it
is equally true that they are out of tune with the poetic
diary that Pound
had written in the interim. Rather than announcing the
central 

<B></B>

 "message"
of the poem, they speak to the personal frustration and rage
that marked
the last stage of the poem's composition.

<p>
Nor are the shifting ideological currents just described
aberrant in
Pound's work. Far from being an accident of Pound's unusual
circumstances
at Pisa, the opposition of aesthetic ideals in <I>The
Cantos</I> between
symbolist closure and diary-like openness, or Pound's
ideological
opposition between mandarin values (Confucius and Mussolini)
and
bohemian-anarchist ones (Villon), recurs in the poem from
the beginning.
The same oppositions characterize Pound's creative and
editorial practices
from the 1910s to the 1960s. To cite a dramatic example, the
text of Canto
6 as <I>revised</I> for <I>A Draft of XXX Cantos</I> ,
which
contributed an important predecessor (Cunizza) to the
goddesses of <I>The
Pisan Cantos,</I> was when originally published in 1919 a
<I>feminist</I>
document, related to Pound's work on <I>The New
Freewoman.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
One way of framing the ideological inconsistencies of
especially <I>The
Pisan Cantos</I> would be to say that just as years earlier
Pound had
begun writing one (quasi-anarchist) version of the modernist
long poem and
had inadvertently shifted into another (fascist) one, here
the process was
momentarily reversed. To put it more broadly, the
ideological affiliations
between fascism and modernist poetics cannot and should not
be understood
in terms that presuppose a straightforward reciprocity, easy
synchronization, or veiled collusion. To be sure, modernism
and fascism
shared common backgrounds of knowledge, beliefs, and
discursive practices,
and at various points between 1920 and 1945 each was often
aggressive in
trying to appropriate, legitimate, and transform the other.
The outcome
was complex. Their affiliations were strong enough to
encourage Pound in
his attempt to write a modernist epic of the fascist
experiment; but they
were also problematic enough to interfere with his efforts
even when he
was working at the height of his powers and most wanted to
do so.

<p>
Moreover, the actual relations between Pound's earlier
American variety of
revolutionary modernism and his later fascism in 1945 seem
anything but
clear cut. Thus, the poem's insistence on natural
observation, which
seemed to contemporary readers in 1945 to be among its
"American"
stengths--connected to the poem's attitude of "repentance"
and
renewal--turns out to have strong "fascist" affiliations. On
the other
hand, the Villon-related segments, which have received
relatively little
attention by critics, can be connected to earlier,
prefascist modernist
practice; according to Emilio Gentile, in Italy between 1918
and 1920
those practices took the form of Futurism's dream of an
"anarchist utopia
of a New State, governed by Futurist artists" and boasting a
"maximum of
individual liberty and cultural cosmopolitanism."
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
No matter
their reliance on certain features of Futurism, neither
Hitler nor
Mussolini could finally tolerate a renegade bohemia such as
the one
Marinetti dreamed about in the 1910s or Villon helped Pound
voice in the
1940s. To argue otherwise is to see a consistency in the
relations between
modernism and fascism that history will not sustain.

In addition, Pound made or allowed his editors to make a
number of
local changes, especially to Canto 81, that included
removing an extensive
series of Chinese characters along with their Confucian
overtones. There
are more than sixteen lines substantially altered in Canto
81 in Pound's
Washington revisions of a new typescript prepared by New
Directions; the
revised typescript also dropped a five line proem to Canto
84. As for the
Chinese characters, there is no written evidence that Pound
authorized
their omission. On the contrary, in letters whose
photocopies are in the
Beinecke Library, Yale University, he badgered James
Laughlin to put them
all in and to do them well. Finally, however, New
Directions's delays in
publication seem to have worn Pound down. At least in a
letter to Laughlin
of 21 [February? 1947?], YCAL Mss 243, Beinecke Library,
Yale University,
he has been reduced to asking that one key ideogram be
allowed to remain
on page six of the <I>Yale Poetry Review</I> proofs of Canto
83 in lieu of
the "more" he remembers being there originally.

<p>
Still, in the instructions Pound scrawled on the first page
of the
typescript copy that was sent to Faber and Faber, he urged
the English
firm to include the characters even though New Directions
had not; see
Pound to Faber and Faber, n.d., Butler Library, Columbia
University. A
letter from James Laughlin to T. S. Eliot, 23 December 1945,

Library, University of Indiana, indicates that Laughlin was
already
worried about the expense of printing them; he asks Eliot to
share the

Dante had placed much-married Cunizza in the sphere of Venus
in Canto
IX of his <I>Paradiso,</I> and, twenty years before Pisa,
Pound, then
meditating on the mystical precisions of Guido Cavalcanti's
<I>"Donna mi
prega,"</I> began to imagine the reasons why. Some time
between 1927 and
1930, he inserted Cunizza into a revised version of Canto 6,
connecting
her magnanimous liberation of family slaves with the quality
of the love
she shared with her troubadour suitor. He expanded the story
in the
contemporary Canto 29. Then, a few years later, in Canto 36,
he insinuated
Cunizza's remarks in the <I>Paradiso</I> about God's thrones
into a
constellation that included <I>"Donna mi prega,"</I>
Erigena, Sordello and
a paean to the sacred light of coitus. All this would be
explained in his
<I>Guide to Kulchur,</I> where he characterized Cunizza as
the woman whose
"charm and imperial bearing [and] grace" had been
responsible for the last
glow of Provencal song and for the transmission of the
culture of mystical
philosophy and Romanesque architecture to the young Guido
and the younger
Dante. See Pound, <I>Guide to Kulchur,</I> 107ff., and for

We know about this last revision even though the original
typescript
pages have not survived because of the evidence of Pound's
typewriters.
Ever since he had started typing his manuscript, Pound had
been using the
army base machine, equipped with pica type. But, as a letter
to Dorothy on
17 October tells us, on that day Olga Rudge and Pound's
daughter Mary
visited the DTC and brough his own machine, which used elite
type. Knowing
that, it becomes apparent from the typescript he delivered
to his lawyer,
Julien Cornell, in Washington D.C., that after 17 October
Pound quickly
rewrote a great deal of what he had thought of as a finished
text. The
first sixteen pages of the twenty-four page typescript of
Canto 74, for
example, had been redone on elite type.

"What's wrong with a cowboy in Hamburg?" asks Dennis Hopper
in the role of
Tom
Ripley in the 1977 film <I>Der amerikani-sche Freund</I>
(The American
Friend).
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
His question bespeaks not only Wim Wenders's
well-known
commitment to the Western genre, but also a long-standing
German
preoccupation
with the iconography of the Far West. From Friedrich
Gerst&auml;cker's
nineteenth-century novels to the Marlboro Man, from Karl
May's imaginary
West to
Harald Reinl's <I>Winnetou-</I>sequels of the 1960s, from
Kafka's Oklahoma
theater to the rock group BAP's 1993 "Blonde Mohikaner,"
German artists,
ideologues, and imagemakers have repeatedly deployed the
mythological
heartpiece
of American popular culture, the Western, in order to
entertain their
audiences,
evaluate the course of modernity, and raise questions
concerning their own
national identity. Transculturated through the cinema, the
imagery of the
American frontier provided, especially during the 1920s and
1930s, symbolic
resources for assessing Germany's abrupt step into the age
of machines,
urban
traffic, democratic will formation, and mechanical
reproduction. Even
though
homegrown adaptations frequently appealed to strong
anti-American
sentiments, the
genre of the Western--the American film par excellence,
according to
Andr&eacute;
Bazin--thus constituted a discursive site at which Germans
negotiated and
contested the meaning of modern culture and society.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
In what follows, I seek to reconstruct some aspects of this
multifarious
iconography of the Western during the Weimar Republic and
Nazi Germany, an
analysis that will lead to a 



 reading of
one of the most eminent German
Western
productions of the 1930s, Luis Trenker's <I>Der Kaiser von
Kalifornien</I>
(The
Emperor of California, 1936).
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
As I will argue, the film
engages
with the Western genre in order to explore issues of
charismatic
leadership,
masculine identity, organic communality, and technological
modernization,
thereby
synthesizing thematic strands that meander through many
German Western
films of
the period, from the silent feature film <I>Der letzte
Mohikaner</I> (The
Last of
the Mohicans, 1920) starring Bela Lugosi, to August Kern's
<I>Der goldene
Gletscher</I> (The Golden Glacier, 1932), Herbert Selpin's
<I>Sergeant
Berry</I>
 and <I>Wasser f&uuml;r Canitoga</I> (Water for
Canitoga, 1939), and
Paul
Verhoeven's <I>Gold in Frisco</I> .
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
The following
pages scout
the trails of Western motifs through Weimar and Nazi
culture, however, not
in
order to provide the reader with a history of the genre in
Germany, nor to
indulge in a normative aesthetic debate as to whether
non-American Western
productions can really live up to the generic excellence of
classical
Hollywood
works. Rather, what is at stake here is the mapping of the
popularity of
the
Western in Germany by means of a critical concept of
cinematic genres, a
concept
that gives equal attention to: the economy of certain
conventions within
individual texts; spectatorial expectations, desires, and
investments; and
specific imperatives of the entertainment industry. Like
other cinematic
genres,
the Western does not simply describe recurring sets of
archetypes,
historical
themes, or iconographic references. We can define its
specificity neither
solely
along semantic lines, as consistent organizations of
thematic or iconic
inventories, nor along syntactic lines, as vehicles for the
reproduction of
certain narrative patterns and "constitutive relationships
between
undesignated
and variable placeholders."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Instead, genres mediate both
syntactic
and semantic matrices, yet also involve a coherent set of
spectatorial
expectations that organize desire and memory across a series
of textual
instances, and a complex cluster of production interests and
commercial
imperatives.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
It therefore seems hardly sufficient to define
and
analyze a genre simply by isolating a number of peculiar
themes, visual
motifs,
dramatic constellations, or authorial inscriptions. Rather,
in assessing
the
generic economy of certain cinematic texts, one also needs
to consider what
different film industries and audiences--steeped in specific
cultural,
historical, and national conditions--accept as generic
examples at a
certain
moment in time. If genres such as the Western cross borders,
and national
film
industries other than Hollywood's even decide to produce
their own, the
decisive
question is not: is this really a Western? What is of
greater interest is
why and
how certain audiences construct a certain text as a
representative of a
specific
genre in the first place, and how this construction reflects
national and
cultural differences.

<p>
Conceived of as structures of expectations and conventions
that link the
film
industry, the individual text, and spectatorial desires, or
as structures
that in
Annette Kuhn's words close the "gap between text and
cinematic apparatus,"
genres
can yield fruitful insights into the intricate relationship
between
distinct
cultural practices and encompassing organizational
frameworks.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
The
examination of genres 

<B></B>

 allows us to
investigate the strategies by means of
which
spectators appropriate the objects of popular taste in order
to position
themselves in their social topographies. The result should
be a productive
encounter between the discipline of film studies and the
larger enterprise
of
cultural studies, i.e. "the examination of the symbolic
orders in which
intersubjective meanings and social practices are
constituted and
contested."
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
I am not interested, therefore, in formal
exegesis, but
rather in showing how popular cultural forms such as the
Westerns operate
as
sites of political battles; how it was possible that
Westerns were so
popular in
Germany in the first place; and how the genre's iconographic
idiom, despite
fascism's Teutonic "blood and soil" rhetoric, could incite
the machinery of
fantasy production that was Nazi cinema to venture its own
renditions.

<p>
A good thirty minutes into the second part of Fritz Lang's
<I>The
Nibelungs</I>
(1924-25), the spectator confronts a perplexing iconographic
transgression. Lang
pictures Attila's Huns as if borrowed directly from the
visual inventory
of the
American frontier: their tents look like Indian tepees,
while the warriors'
hairdos and makeup resemble precisely those conventionally
reserved for
Native
Americans. In a cozy campfire setting, a bard sings about
Kriemhild, the
femme
fatale, in language steeped in the ethnic lingo of frontier
fantasies:
"The white
woman stole and bound our Lord, / She used her golden
tresses as cord, /
Attila,
our Lord and Master, /--Attila, the warrior Lord!" At first
sight, one
wonders
why Lang, in order to picture the savagery that prevails in
the heart of
central-European darkness, transports his German spectator
of the 1920s to
the
Far West, donning the Germanic epic par excellence in the
imagery of
American
popular culture. Lang's decision is especially perplexing
since the
fantasies of
Indian primitivism call attention to the intertextuality in
the diegetic
process,
attention at odds with the film's overall obsession with
stylistic
closure. A
tentative answer might be found in a consideration of Weimar
film history.
After
the end of the postwar import embargo in 1921, Hollywood
Westerns flooded
the
German cinemas, primarily consisting of dated serialized
productions
dumped on
the newly available German market. For what film historians
customarily
consider
the key players of Weimar cinema, these highly conventional,
sensationalist,
dramatically underdeveloped films were evidence enough to
prove the
incompatibility of artistic quality and commercial
interests. Hollywood
Westerns
effectively confirmed the need to sustain a national cinema
of aesthetic
experimentation and stylistic auto-nomy, a specifically
German film
language that
would not simply compete with the Hollywood system, but undo
its technical
deficiency, dramatic barbarism, and generic monotony.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Yet
Weimar
popular taste, of course, was far less homogeneous and
highbrow than later
film
critics have often suggested, and it comes as no surprise
that even the
most
inferior Hollywood Westerns turned into box office hits, or
that more
commercially oriented German film studios were soon
producing their own 

<B></B>

versions
to meet the overwhelming demand for "backwood adventures of
the James
Fenimore
Cooper variety."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
Against this background of mass reception, criticism, and
generic
adaptation of
Hollywood Westerns in Weimar Germany, Lang's Americanist
excursion in
<I>The
Nibelungs</I> might be understood as a subtle gesture that
not only quoted
what
was proliferating in contemporary movie palaces, but also
involved the
spectator
in a metadiscourse about competing, nationally specific
forms of cinematic
representation. While Lang cloaks European savagery in the
idiom of the
Western,
he also marks the generic conventions of the Western as a
savage
spectacle, an
infantile genre, highly inferior to his own cinematic
modernism and
diegetic
control. What for the lowbrow viewer articulated a tribute
to the popular
genre
of the Western, documented in the eye of the highbrow
spectator the
superiority
of the German film language, a national cinema of aesthetic
experimentation which
resists commercial formulism.

<p>
However, the institutional position of Weimar cinema,
organized around
variables
as different as foreign policy, expressionist genius
aesthetics, and the
anxiety
of older elites about film as a new public sphere, provides
only one
argument to
account for Lang's iconic deviation. At the same time, the
Hun sequence
bears
testimony to the discursive specter that haunted Germany in
particular
during the
relatively stable middle years of the Weimar Republic: the
debates about
so-called Americanization, controversies to which German
images of the Far
West
did not remain immune. Americanism in the 1920s emerged as a
labyrinthine
discursive site for German debates about the meaning of
modernity, the
contemporary reorganization of social practices, and forms
of political
representation.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
For some, the alleged American equation of
technological and cultural modernization promised salvation
from the
burdens of
the past, and relief from oppressive traditions and
fossilized
institutions.
American mass culture in particular became an enthusiastic
rallying cry, a
"vehicle for the radical modernization and democratization
of both German
culture
and life."
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
For others, American technology and capitalism
expressed
a dangerous bastardization of culture, a monstrous triumph
of greed and
materialism, trends that fostered uniformity and
mechanization, emasculated
private and public life, and thwarted traditional
definitions of social
privileges and cultural identities. Amidst the political and
cultural
turmoil of
the Weimar Republic, "America" red as a discursive
crossroad for highly
contradictory agendas, a screen to express individual
anxieties and
political
discontents, denounce the valleys of civilization from the
vistas of
culture,
provoke the old cultural and political elites, or vent
utopian fantasies.

<p>
German engagement with the nexus of social modernization,
mass culture, and
technological progress was articulated through not only
countless reports
of
American cityscapes and machine parks, but also what was
imagined as the
wide
open spaces of the West. In often enigmatic and ambivalent
ways, Western
imagery
simultaneously helped to express and displace, reveal and
conceal the very
subjects under debate. Yet in contrast to earlier images of
colonial
America, the
Weimar preoccupation with American cowboys, settlers, and
Indians took a
new and
decisive turn: 

<B></B>

 the signifier "America"
was no longer just a harbinger of
new life
styles; it also promised the advent of a new regime of
representation, the
revolutionary technology of cinematic representation itself.
Weimar images
of the
West, in other words, reflected the remarkable fact that the
genre of the
Western--as pulp fiction or picture show--had developed into
what Ernst
Bloch
would have termed an instance of unsynchronicity.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
For the
very
process of technological modernization that had resulted in
the success of
the
cinema had also put the hero of the traditional Western, the
six-gun
cowboy, out
of work. Socially dysfunctional in the twentieth century,
the Westerner
survived
only in the movie theaters, recreated as a myth, an
imaginary icon of
heroic
masculinity and legitimate violence: if history becomes a
film, show the
film.
Weimar representations of the West, located in the context
of debates about
American mass culture, often sought to engage actively with
the genre's
constitutive unsynchronicity, showing that the popular
historiography of
the West
had become concomitant with the history of cinematic
representation, that
the
Western film, as a genre, was a product of the very
conditions that had
made its
heroes disappear.

Consider, for example, Karl Hubbuch's colored drawing
<I>Leatherstocking</I> (ca.
1921), depicting an urban sidewalk tableau with both
electrical appliances
and a
film advertisement (<a href=2.3koepnick_1.html> 1</a>). At
first sight,
one is tempted
to read the
movie
poster within this sketch as an incentive to imaginary
escape from the
sterile,
technological physiognomy 

<B></B>

 of the urban
metropolis. But Hubbuch draws his
ad for a
Western film in a conspicuously dismembered fashion,
severing the dramatic
event,
the struggle that--we are led to believe--occupies the
center of the
poster.
Further, he brutally invades the romantic representation
within the
representation with markers of economical instrumentality,
the sticker
"Kartenverkauf hier" (tickets sold here) glued right over
the face of one
of the
internal onlookers (note the upper-left portion of <a
href=2.3koepnick_1.html> 1</a>).
Surprisingly,
what is
excluded from our vision of the movie poster, action and
heroic t,
reemerges
synecdochically in the form of the arrow inscribed in the
hardware of
modernity.
As a result of what one might call with Mary Pratt an
inverted process of
transculturation, one that creates a curious symbolic
exchange between the
Wild
West and the modern city, the arrow on the electric box
signifies the very
drama
that escapes our view in the movie ad.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Electric modernity and
American frontier thus constitute an intricate play of
presence and
absence, one
that calls attention to the modern moment that triggers the
invocation of
the
West and endows it with economical functions. Hubbuch's
drawing not only
reveals
the technological apparatus that prompts Weimar fantasies of
Western
heroism, but
also betrays the fact that cinematic modernity summons and
shapes the very
content of such fantasies.

Compare Hubbuch's drawing with Paul Gangolf's 1922
lithograph,
<I>Cinema</I>
(<a href=2.3koepnick_2.html> 2</a>), which radically blurs
the borders
among the
representation of
Western
themes, the cinematic apparatus, and the forms of modern
urban life. Part
of
Gangolf's cycle titled <I>Metropolis,</I> <I>Cinema</I>
depicts a chaotic
crowd
of people in a nocturnal German city. Over the heads of the
mob looms a
film
poster announcing the Western movie <I>Land Without Sun,</I>
with the
frightening
features of an Indian. Here urban life appears as a dark
amalgam of hardly
discernible, anonymous individuals, while the street becomes
an extension
of the
cinematic auditorium. The picture show, in a movement of
ironic inversion,
has
become the witness and interpreter of the city's Kafkaesque
hustle and
bustle; it
exposes modern urbanity as a savage spectacle of asphalt
cowboys and city
Indians. In contrast to Hubbuch and his
<I>Leatherstocking,</I> Gangolf
shows a
city that is still ensnared in the mythic patterns of the
Western, a city
in
which cinematic projection and urban traffic endlessly
reproduce the
mythic past.
Whereas for Hubbuch the Western owed its very existence to
modern
technologies of
fantasy production, Gangolf contends that Westerns tell the
inner truth
about
metropolitan life and a modern urban age that has failed to
live up to its
own
standards of rationality and enlightenment. Westerns, he
suggests, reveal
to
urban audiences the mythic captivation that marks the center
of their
putative
modernity.

<p>
Weimar references to the American West were complex. On the
one hand, they
participated, like Lang's <I>The Nibelungs,</I> in the
construction of a
national
cinema: they earmarked the artistic savagery of Hollywood
commercialism
and genre
cinema, and thus legitimized claims for a specifically
German film
language that
was derived from the legacy of nineteenth-century genius
aesthetics and
twentieth-century expressionism. On the other hand, and more
importantly,
Western
imagery also red as a catalyst to negotiate the meaning
of
Americanization
and urbanization, and thus to contest the value of
technological progress,
mass
culture, and democratization. The rural universe of cowboys
and Indians,
moved
into and reinvented in the cinemas of the 1920s, presented a
mirror image,
a
double, a projection screen of the technological world to
which it owed its
actual existence. Henceforth, the American past, imagined or
real, could
return
forever through technological mediation, a spectacle for
mass audiences, a
simulacrum open for an ample set of different political
agendas and
conflicting
ideological inscriptions.

<p>
The enthusiastic and bewildering proliferation of Western
themes in Germany
originally evolved from the same historical context that
gave birth to the
untranslatable notion of <I>Heimat</I> (homeland): the
inward rebellion of
the
late nineteenth-century petty bourgeoisie against urban
capitalist
modernity and
the rise of bureaucratic apparatuses.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Both notions expressed
complex anxieties about the course of modernization, about
the unsettling
effects
of urban technology, monetary exchange, and functional
abstraction.
Portraits of
bucolic homeland settings and idealized 

<B></B>

 images of
the American West became focal
catalysts of fantasy production, offering imaginary
redemption from
cultural
discontent: they sketched places "of epic action, heroic
individualism and
liberated wilderness," helping to release the
disenfranchised urbanite
from the
iron cage of modern routinization.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
They also served as
discursive
injunctions to reduce symbolically the vicissitudes of
modern politics and
economics to questions of morality. In a truly Wagnerian
move, the early
literary
Western genre portrayed economic instabilities as the result
of egotistical
materialism and corrupt ethical dispositions, not restraints
placed upon
the
individual by inadequate social structures. Often
counterposing American
greed
with true German spirituality, German Western stories
promoted a symbolic
order
that provided for popular identification and consolation,
and hence secured
meanings and identities amidst the alleged unhomeliness of
modern Germany.
The
Far West promised a reconstruction of the homeland somewhere
else, and so
became
a screen for projecting what nineteenth-century German
discourse
considered the
resources of homeliness: individual authenticity,
unfragmented temporal
continuity, undistorted spatial closure, and idyllic harmony
between a
homogeneous social body and its natural environment.

<p>
In the texts of Otto Rupius, Balduin M&ouml;llhausen,
Friedrich Armand
Strubberg,
and Friedrich Gerst&auml;cker, countless and often barely
literate readers
found
vehicles for imaginary travel to the New World. Yet popular
Western
fictions, in
conjunction with letters sent back by emigrants, offered
much more than
simply
fantastic escape: they participated in the construction of
an alternative
public
sphere, one inimical to bourgeois reading practices (e.g.
the newspaper),
and
they became manuals that prepared for what, around 1850,
seemed like a mass
exodus over the Atlantic--pulp fiction as a form of
operative literature in
Benjamin's sense, a form of storytelling that instructed the
disempowered
how to
succeed in their quest for a new homeland abroad. As Ray
Allen Billington
writes,
they might not have been "the most accurate purveyors of
information, but
they
were better than nothing."
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
It was only around the turn of the
century, however, after the actual heyday of German
emigration, that Karl
May
enjoyed his enormous popularity, a success that bespeaks a
fundamental
transformation of the German Western genre from a swatch of
migration
aspirations
to a catalyst of exotic fantasies and transrations.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
May,
whose
influence according to one commentator was "greater than
that of any other
author
between Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Thomas Mann,"
rendered the West as a
tabula rasa that awaited the inscription of imaginary new
social orders,
symbolic
structures, and the kind of "customs" that abound in his
novels.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
To
be sure, May's novels were also propelled by the same
"nostalgia for the
romantic
and exotic" that had driven his predecessors: his Indians
were the picture
of the
noble savage, while his Western setting served as a rallying
point against
American materialism and greed.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
But for May the American
West no
longer offered a real possibility for the construction of a
new material
homeland--the entire frontier problematic is virtually
absent; instead, it
was a
realm of spiritual and religious salvation. In the heroic
res of Old
Shatterhand and Winnetou, Siegfried and Parsifal still
seemed to
fraternize, to
continue 

<B></B>

 their respective voyages to
the final frontier of mercy and
redemption
in the undivided, curiously internalized landscapes of the
West. Although
May
mapped a spiritual rather than a material place, his novels
fed directly
into the
imperialist projects of Wilhelminian Germany around the turn
of the
century, the
proverbial belated German aspirations to find a "place in
the sun." As his
texts
traversed fictional geographies, envisioned new social
orders from
scratch, and
relocated traditional meanings, especially the rhetoric of
Christianity, to
exotic settings, May played a pivotal role in the
proliferation of the
cultural
vocabulary necessary for imperial rule: the hierarchization
of different
cultures, the aligning of narrative and spatial practices,
and the jargon
of
unquestioned authority and domination.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
As German visual artists during the 1920s or filmmakers
during the 1930s
engaged
with the Western genre, one whose proper subject domain at
this point was
already
relegated to the past, they often tried to synthesize the
far from
homogeneous
functions that the West had fulfilled in nineteenth-century
German
literature.
The Far West invited one to embark upon a passage through
space as much as
it
allowed for a voyage through time--a voyage not simply to an
imaginary
past of
unhampered individualism and archaic nature, but also to the
artists' or
filmmakers' own childhood fantasies, shaped by the reading
of adventure
literature and the experience of ethnographic exhibits
<I>(V&ouml;lkerschauen)</I> in the zoos and circuses that
were so popular
around
the turn of the century. Yet Germany's visual iconography of
the West,
after the
end of World War I, also contained an increasing store of
motifs that were
filtered through the lenses of the American Westerns that
swept through
German
movie theaters during the early 1920s. As the history of the
West turned
into a
powerful movie myth, it offered in the specific German
context ample
possibilities for a hybridization of Americanism,
technological modernity,
and
political romanticism, the ideological legacy of the
nineteenth century.
Mechanically reproduced Western images during the 1920s and
1930s helped
relocate
the ideological inventory of nineteenth-century Germany into
the twentieth
century, to renegotiate the legacy of the past, and thus
create powerful
myths of
modernity.

<p>
The imagery of the West thus became a switchboard of
competing political
agendas,
a curious double of what was perceived around 1930 as the
uncanny nature of
modern Germany, which increasingly left considerable traces
on both the
German
encounter with modern urban America and the construction of
German national
identity. To put it another way, Westerns, during the 1920s
and 1930s,
were not
seen as simply presenting a temporal and spatial other to
modern
metropolitan
life. Rather, they were viewed--as for example in the works
and writings of
Rudolf Schlichter--as a testimony to a process of mutual
cultural
displacement
and inscription, one that defined urban modernity in Germany
as the
perpetuation
and reinvention of the mythic Far West, a rodeo of asphalt
cowboys and city
Indians, but also as a genuinely cinematic enterprise,
cinema in and of
itself, a
simulacrum.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Moreover, this multilayered transculturation of
the
Western in modern Germany, containing elements from early
Hollywood cinema
and
the relics of German nineteenth-century imagination, deeply
affected the
course
of early German film genres 

<B></B>

 in many
surprising ways. The presence of
Western
themes in German movie theaters, it can be argued, inspired
the formation
of the
one original film genre German film history has generated,
the mountain
film,
which directors such as Arnold Franck turned into a
distinctly national
genre,
one "whose appeal lay in primal nature explored with
advanced technology,
in
premodern longings mediated by modern machines."
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Yet the
mountain
film's technophilic mediation of abstract alpine shapes and
melodramatic
stories,
in turn, had a lasting impact on the future of German
Western renditions.
It is
no coincidence that two of Franck's closest collaborators,
Luis Trenker and
Harald Reinl, were to become the key res of German
Western productions
during
the 1930s and 1960s respectively.

<p>
Given the multiple historical, ideological, and generic
trajectories that
intersect in German images of the Far West, it should come
as no surprise
that
many of the narrative threads and stock situations that
typify the
classical
paradigm undergo highly instructive transformations in the
German context.
By and
large, classical American Westerns involve their spectators
in dramas
about the
precarious breakthrough of modern civilization, dramas that
map the
historical
conflict of savagery, natural morality, and civilized
legality, and that
thereby
problematize the costs of social as well as legal
modernization.
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Historically and geographically located at the interface
between
civilization and
anarchic nature, the classical Western stages an encounter
between
different
attitudes towards legality and morality, in the climactic
course of which
violent
actions appear morally justified insofar as they constitute
or
reconstitute the
integrity of universal legal structures. If the hero kills,
if he turns
savage,
he does so only to redeem the power of the law and ensure
the final
victory of
civilization. As a mythic narrative of legitimation, the
Western presents
an
often paradoxical, quasi-decisionistic foundation of
legality that is
poised
against a constant threat from what is pictured as the
identity of savage
life
and savage landscape. Significantly, the classical paradigm
often develops
this
clash of different attitudes towards legality as a
confrontation of
conflicting
notions about writing and communicative exchange. In John
Ford's <I>The
Man Who
Shot Liberty Valance</I> , for example, Stoddard, the
James Stewart
character and an advocate of formal legality, law and order,
imports the
alphabet
as well as the art of writing and reading to the frontier
town, whereas
Liberty
destroys the town's printing machine to continue his regime
of arbitrary
terror.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
According to the historical-philosophical dialectic
of the
Western, Colts are succeeded by the power of words, yet
words often need
Colts to
gain their institutional power: Stoddard's victory over
Liberty results
not from
an act of rational persuasion, but from John Wayne's
underhanded
intervention,
his murder.

<p>
German Westerns, which are saturated with what Jochen
Schulte-Sasse has
called
May's antirational, antimodern, and anticapitalist rhetoric,
have largely
ignored
the legal and constitutional reverberations at the core of
the American
model.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
In contrast to the foundational conflict between
outlaws and
legalists, or the mythic-historical struggle around the
civilization of
the West,
German Western authors have either tried--like May--to
dehistoricize the
West, to
portray it as a space free of any encroaching signs of legal
and industrial
modernity; or, more importantly, they have 

<B></B>

 sought to translate the quest
for law
and order into a romantic struggle between materialism and
spirituality,
greed
and self-sacrifice, capitalist tempo and agrarian
timelessness. In the
wake of
May's romantic anticapitalism, German Westerns, in
particular those of the
1930s,
tend to construe the West as an ultimately ahistorical
laboratory that
collapses
economy into morality. Ironically, they mystify as egotism
and decadence
the
excesses of modern economic life--corporate capitalism,
monetary
abstraction,
fierce competition--while they sustain the image of the
Western hero as a
reincarnation of the capitalist entrepreneur, the putative
model of labor
and
productivity, one who is unalienated, not egotistical. In so
doing, German
Westerns not only miss the complex legal implications that
govern the
frontier
ideology of the American paradigm. Mapping the Far West as a
space of
spiritual
<I>Bildung</I> and soul seeking, they also modify the
classical Western's
politics of writing. Writing and explicit literacy in German
Westerns no
longer
document a commitment to universal legal norms and
institutions: they mark
the
superiority of Christianity over unbelief, as in May's
stories; of
political
idealism over the anarchy of egotism, as in the opening
sequence of
Trenker's
<I>Der Kaiser von Kalifornien;</I> or of visual thought over
abstract
scientific
knowledge, as in Selpin's <I>Wasser f&uuml;r Canitoga.</I>

<p>
To the extent that German Westerns rewrite the quest for law
and order as a
romantic search for spiritual refinement and communal
harmony, they also
significantly modify the tensions among categories such as
individuality,
religion, and institutionalization, tensions that determine
the narrative
thrust
of the classical formula. Although abundant with signs of
religious
devotion--the
church as a meeting ground for the community of settlers,
the Caucasian
housewife
as an advocate of Christian faith--the traditional Western,
in its
preoccupation
with images of male heroism and nonregulated individualism,
tends to posit
"a
world without God, without ideas, without institutions,
without what is
commonly
recognized as culture, a world of men and things, where male
adults in the
prime
of life find ultimate meaning in doing their best together
on the
job."
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Cowboys and gunslingers operate beyond the security of
institutional frameworks. They are propelled by their pathos
of
lonesomeness and
austerity, their hostility to any form of human, let alone
sexual,
attachment,
their denial of sensual pleasure, and their blurring of the
borders
between work
and leisure. As proponents of innerworldly asceticism, the
striving
cowboys--in
spite of their apparent godlessness--ideally incorporate the
force of what
Max
Weber has conceptualized as the Protestant work ethic:
puritan
self-control and
methodical organization of conduct, the denial of
innerworldly pleasure and
enjoyment for the sake of concentrating exclusively on the
orders of the
day.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
Lacking stable institutions and guaranteed paths to
salvation,
the lonesome cowboy finds temporary, albeit imaginary,
relief from the
imperatives of Protestant asceticism in bars and alcohol
alone: "At the
cowboys'
places of entertainment, the saloons . . . things are dreary
and
hysterical at
once; it is only in a state of intoxication that he may
rest--the cowboy
drowns
the puritan in himself."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

<p>
German Westerns forfeit the institutional ambivalence of the
classical
American
paradigm, and in so doing, they often reevaluate the
Westerner's position
vis-&agrave;-vis 

<B></B>

 religious belief
systems as well. In many of the German
texts,
the cowboy himself becomes the harbinger of
institutionalization: he
establishes
codified frameworks of communal conduct among Westerner
groups, meanwhile
ting the institutional excesses of trusts, egotistical
bankers,
intoxicated
gold diggers, or bands of villains. May, for example, not
only mapped the
West as
a range open to Christian conversion; his novels indulged in
the
construction of
solid hierarchies among the traveling groups of Westerners,
good and evil
ones.
Populated by genies and Nietzschean
superhumans-turned-pathfinders, May's
frontier world brought to the fore the inauguration of "a
hierarchy which
was no
less authoritarian than the one during the Bismarck Reich
and
Wilhelminism."
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
May's German successors continued his
institutional
fixation. Whether Westerners get involved in the corrupt
politics of the
gold
rush as in Kern's <I>Der goldene Gletscher</I> or
Verhoeven's <I>Gold in
New
Frisco,</I> or t for the integrity of their spatial or
technological
projects
as in Trenker's <I>Der Kaiser von Kalifornien</I> and
Selpin's <I>Wasser
f&uuml;r
Canitoga,</I> German Westerns of the 1930s engage their
protagonists in
conflicts
between competing tracks of institutionalization, between
corrupt and
virtuous
stratifications of the body politic. As a consequence, the
entire genre
changes
focus: in the American Western the hero is ultimately left
at the fringes
of the
process and politics of civilization; in German Westerns of
the 1930s--as
I will
detail in a moment--the heroes inscribe their politics right
into the
center of
the narratives. Rather than culminating in tension-laden
shootouts between
stern
opposing heroes, both <I>Wasser f&uuml;r Canitoga</I> and
<I>Der Kaiser von
Kalifornien,</I> for example, end with political assemblies
and passionate
deliberations that try to secure the workings of existing
institutions. If
the
American Western <I>cum grano salis</I> elaborates on
transcendental
homelessness
and innerworldly asceticism, German adaptations bespeak the
search for a
homogeneous community, the establishment of effective
patterns of
leadership and
submission, the protection of institutional meaning and
individual faith.
Rebelling against the classical Western's puritanism, German
Westerns seek
to
institutionalize--however precariously--innerworldly meaning
and
contentment
through rigid processes of ordering the social body and its
relation to
nature, a
gesture that in the most striking case of Trenker's <I>Der
Kaiser von
Kalifornien</I> outspokenly admits its Catholic
underpinnings.

<p>
In 1933 the painter Rudolf Schlichter described his
rediscovery of May's
and
Cooper's Western themes: "For me, Wagner's world fused with
American jungle
poetry into a peculiar myth of legendary adventures."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
Western
fantasies, during the 1920s and 1930s, transported
Schlichter's "old,
half-forgotten dreams of my youth" to the present and thus
opened up a
door to
exotic escapades in response to the technological
imperatives of modern
urban
life.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Moreover, and more importantly, for Schlichter as for
many
others the Western became a cultural technology to infuse
urban modernity
with
ideological resources borrowed from the nineteenth century:
Wagner's
late-romantic attack on the corrupting effects of money and
bureaucratic
abstraction. Schlichter and others were thus able to
amalgamate
nineteenth-century anticapitalism, American iconography, and
German
modernity
into a single image. Schlichter's modernist aesthetic, in
particular, was
shaped
less by the mere citation 

<B></B>

 of Western
themes than by their cinematic
renditions on
the dream screens of Weimar movie theaters, less by the
rediscovery of
childhood
fantasies than by the new encounter with the cinematic
apparatus.
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The American West emerged as a double, a "soul brother," a
psychic
extension and
elective affinity of modern German life.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
In the context of
the
Americanism debates of the 1920s and 1930s, Westerns became
vehicles that
stored
and represented the mythic sediment of Western modernity. On
the one hand,
they
appeared powerful enough to reveal the inner truth about
modern urban
life, a
life still entrenched in a mythic perpetuation of struggle
and hostility.
On the
other hand, they also promised to relocate certain meanings
to the
twentieth
century. To the extent that they capitalized on heroism,
individualism, and
romantic quest, they provided semantic resources by means of
which
individual and
collective identities could be constructed and maintained
<I>within</I> the
alleged confines of modern routinization. Paradoxically,
then, as a site of
multiple unsynchronicity and displacement, the film genre of
the Western in
Germany during the 1920s and 1930s allowed mass audiences to
make crucial
compromises with modernity, compromises that--as I will
detail in the
remainder
of this paper with regard to Trenker's <I>Der Kaiser von
Kalifornien</I>--all too
often conformed to the kind of political programs Jeffrey
Herf has
described as
the projects of reactionary modernism.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The film <I>Der
Kaiser von
Kalifornien,</I> as a powerful hybridization of the uniquely
German
<I>Heimatfilm</I> genre and the American Western formula,
not only imbued
sentimental longings for homeliness with the rhetoric of
colonial
appropriation,
but also sought to engineer highly affective spectatorial
responses.
Providing a
dramatic, elaborately controlled choreography of images and
sounds in the
tradition of Wagner's <I>Gesamtkunstwerk</I> (total
artwork), Trenker's
film, in
accordance with many other feature films during the Nazi
period, promoted
the
vision of a new man in the service of the new political
order.

In an enthusiastic homage to Luis Trenker's lifework,
William Everson
describes
Trenker as "Germany's John Wayne and John Ford rolled into
one . . . an
auteur
long before that term came into common usage."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Grossly
exaggerated
though this comparison may seem, Everson's claim concerning
Trenker's
auteurism--the fusion of directorship, off-screen
personality, and screen
character--is useful in approaching the rugged world of
Trenker's films, in
particular his confrontation with the myths of the Far West
in <I>Der
Kaiser von
Kalifornien.</I> As Ford and Wayne in one, Trenker never
hesitated to
inscribe
his auteurist ambitions on a variety of diegetic levels in
his narrative,
thereby
leaving signatures that yield access to the film's political
investments.

<p>
Grand panoramic vistas, writes David Spurr in a 1993 study
of colonial
discourse,
often yield commanding views in which aesthetic sentiments,
the production
of
knowledge, and the assumption or exertion of authority
become one and the
same:
"[T]he commanding view is an originating gesture of
colonization itself,
making
possible the exploration and mapping of territory which
serves as a
preliminary
to a colonial 

<B></B>

 order."
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
In Trenker's <I>Der Kaiser von
Kalifornien,</I> ocular practices of this sort are
fundamental for the
film's
hero, Luis Trenker in the role of Johann August Sutter, and
they prove
indispensable to his efforts to establish an agrarian
community in Northern
California and ensure his patriarchal authority over the new
homeland. What
occurs is a fusion of power and optics, which is best
epitomized in scenes
of
visionary speculation, moments when the gaze is installed in
the rhetorical
position that Mary Pratt has called the "monarch of all I
survey"
position.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
In the film's opening sequence, Sutter, persecuted
by the
police for his daring political interventions, takes refuge
on top of the
church
of his Swiss hometown. As Sutter climbs the stairs, his
progress is
rendered in
the form of a striking superimposition that conflates the
image of Sutter
with a
slow upward tilt of the camera following the tower's rise
into the sky, a
motion
that fuses camerawork and heroic ascent into a sublime vista
point that,
in turn,
will become the setting for a scene of spiritual
introspection and
redemption.
Once on the tower's peak, and ready to leap to his death,
Sutter meets his
alter
ego, the apparition of Ernst Moritz Arndt, the nationalist
poet of the
early
nineteenth century. Arndt, in the posture of a magician,
conjures a
sequence of
panoramic visions that capture Sutter's gaze and purge his
suicidal
despair:
mountain ridges and dreamy lakes, wide open prairies, empty
deserts, and,
finally, the view of the ocean, the utopian signifier of
emigration and
escape.
Arndt's panopticon of endless landscapes, projected against
the screens of
Sutter's imagination, immediately rejuvenates the hero's
will to power
while
kindling his colonial fantasies. "Isn't the world
beautiful?" asks Arndt
as the
master of the imaginary.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
His mapping of American pastoral
beauty is
a prelude to the colonial order that Sutter will later
establish: aesthetic
pleasure, achieved by an elevation of the gaze to a point
independent of
all
topographical restrictions, provides the resources for
geographical
conquest and
political legitimation. Dressed like a cowboy, the poet
Arndt sketches out
a
program of colonization that translates the power of images
directly into
images
of power. "You can serve your people everywhere," he says to
Sutter. "You
can
t everywhere."
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Arndt's cinema of geographical
attractions,
mesmerizing Sutter's and the spectator's eye, distracts the
hero from his
resignation and bestows on him the visionary powers
necessary to stake out
his
new place in the sun, a place that relocates his Helvetian
homeland to the
other
side of the Atlantic.

<p>
It is worth noting that Arndt does not reappear until the
end of the
narrative,
employing his pictorial magic to comfort Sutter after the
destruction of
New
Helvetia at the hands of greedy American bankers and gold
diggers. Now,
however,
instead of conjuring images of wide open spaces, the poet
projects
pictures of
dense American cityscapes (New York and Los Angeles) and
clusters of
abstractly
revolving machines, images that are at variance with the
ostensible
subject of
his speech, creating, for both Sutter and the spectator, a
radical
disjuncture
between images and discourse. "Be content, you have served
the world in
your own
way," we hear the cowboy-poet Arndt say to Sutter while he
is dying on the
steps
of the Capitol. "Your heart will beat forever in the forests
and rivers of
California."
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Whereas in the beginning Arndt's magic had
invited
acts of spatial appropriation, now it presents images meant
to invoke
heroic
renunciation, testimony to the superiority of spirit over
the 

<B></B>

 unsettling
forces
of materialism. The pictures of American modernity become a
means to
absolve the
hero of colonial hubris. What counts, we are to infer from
Arndt's
declaration,
are not the physical manifestations of colonial enterprises,
but rather
what
motivated them: the spirit of self-sacrifice and faith. What
counts, Arndt
pronounces--in effect he disavows the very images that he
has conjured for
Sutter
and the spectator--is not the materiality of modern life,
but rather the
thrust
that made it possible in the first place. Significantly, in
the last
sequence,
Trenker's film reaches out for a final apotheosis by
recycling earlier
frames
from Sutter's trek through the desert and superimposing them
on an image (a
virtual screen) of towering cloud formations: when the myth
of colonialism
has
degenerated into crude reality (e.g. the previously shown
cities), and
when the
colonial spirit has yielded to abstract capitalist traffic,
we are left
with
nothing more than myth as fantasy--myth as cinema.

<p>
Like Arndt, Sutter himself on several occasions operates as
a
quasi-cinematic
vision machine in whose eyes aesthetic pleasure, spatial
appropriation,
and the
execution of power over fellow immigrants become one and the
same.
Consider the
California sequence showing Sutter at the height of his
success as he
rides in
the attitude of an unquestioned patriarch through his
estates. A low-angle
close-up shot pictures the hero's face, proudly gazing left
and right,
while the
deliberate overexposure of the images endows his features
with an almost
divine
aura. This close-up intercuts several times to what the
spectator must
assume is
Sutter's point of view, though Trenker's montage editing--in
a somewhat
Eisensteinian move--disappoints our desire for spatial
continuity between
the
scenes that we will see through Sutter's imperial eyes. The
first intercut
maps a
grand orchard with trees neatly lined up in geometric lines
and shapes:
rough
nature turned into an ordered garden. The second displays a
gigantic wheat
field
exposed to the gentle rhythms of the winds, a scene that
literally
displays the
writing of nature on the surface of the visible. The third
consists of four
different shots of farm workers who are swinging their
scythes in
harmonious
rhythms. Presented to Sutter's and our own gaze as a unified
conration
of
bodies and synchronized movements, the harvesters appear
forged into what
Kracauer would call a mass ornament.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
In a manner strikingly
consonant with Nazi ideologies of labor, individual work is
rendered not as
exertion, but as a form of music, a ritual of communal
communication that
allegedly transcends the confinements of modern subjectivity
and routine.
The
fourth intercut pictures a large group of sheep, transformed
into one body
by a
black sheepdog that approaches from the left and drives the
multitude of
animals
in a single movement to the right. This last shot, drawing
from the formal
tradition of Eisenstein's intellectual montage, presents us
with a visual
metaphor for what we have seen before: the charismatic
creation of
integrated
communities in which the unified shape counts more than the
individual
body.
Social integration, according to Trenker's agrarian diorama,
is like the
harmonious alignment of social body and natural environment:
it results
solely
from the presence of a commanding gaze, eyes powerful enough
to establish
a nexus
between aesthetic experience and social discipline. 

<B></B>

<p>
Christopher Frayling, in his study of the Spaghetti Western,
has
emphasized the
antimodern impetus of Trenker's films.
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
Trenker, combining
epic
grandeur with intensely sentimental domestic scenes,
embraces the Western
genre
as a cinematic vessel to escape the allegedly ugly
physiognomy of modern
urban
life; his Westerns, following the epic sentimentalism of
contemporary Nazi
feature films, are grounded in a premodern desire for
redemption, a
romantic
wandering into the past that displaces the technological
outlook of the
present
with images of reciprocal harmony between social body and
elemental
forces.
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Although Frayling's analysis is insightful and to the
point, it seems necessary to elaborate on the distinctively
modern moment
that
propels Trenker's cinematic search for agrarian salvation,
whether in the
Tyrolean mountains or the California desert. For in the
above-mentioned
sequence,
Trenker not only marks the hero's gaze as a distinctively
cinematic one, a
vision
machine, he also indicates that his idyllic images of
harvesting are
technological constructions in the first place, conjured by
the eye of the
camera
and the skill of editing. In a manner that recapitulates the
visual logic
of the
mountain film genre, and in surprising synchronicity with
the antimimetic
gestures of modernistic painting, landscapes in Trenker's
films of the
1930s
often achieve almost abstract qualities.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Assuming the gaze
of the
film's hero, the camera in the harvest sequence of <I>Der
Kaiser von
Kalifornien</I> deterritorializes the landscape through
veneration,
turning the
visual surface into a playground of pure bodies, outlines,
shapes, and
movements.
Modern man's machines in Trenker's films not only create the
natural
sublime,
they become "natural." Like Arnold Franck, Trenker too seems
to claim that
"nature remains mute and unexpressive unless captured by the
camera," thus
elevating mediated effects to natural presences.
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Sutter, as
the
film's director and cinematographer in disguise, invokes
what Leo
Lowenthal has
called the "rhythmic principle," an authoritarian concept of
nature which
calls
for individual and collective subjection to alleged laws of
natural
circularity.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
While Sutter's cinematic gaze at once enables
and
authorizes images of nature that are to replace the
timetables of history
with
the unchangeable rhythms of the seasons, it also actively
transmogrifies
natural
forms and human formations into ornamental conrations.
Yet in
containing the
imagined elemental as ornament, Trenker masks the
instrumental reason that
fuels
Sutter's very project of California colonization. As it
constructs and maps
agrarian beauty through Sutter's commanding gaze, Trenker's
cinematic
apparatus
renders political authority solely a function of aesthetic
beauty, thereby
reducing the complexity of modern power and legitimation to
a question of
charismatic appearance, an issue of ocular control over the
body politic.
Like
fascism in Walter Benjamin's famous reading, Trenker's
antimodern modernism
replaces politics with aesthetics.

<p>
Trenker's <I>Der Kaiser von Kalifornien</I> is shot through
with longing
for
premodern wonders and routines, as Frayling rightly
observes; but it uses
these
to endorse a strangely modernist project in a twofold
manner. On the one
hand,
Trenker wants to restore auratic experiences through a
deliberate use of
modern
machines; twentieth-century technologies of seeing and
representation are
to
endow colonial countrysides with a renewed sense of
metaphysical depth and
a
mystical unity between humanity 

<B></B>

 and
nature. On the other hand, and in a
manner
similar to that of Rudolf Borchardt's modernist sketch of
the Italian
landscape
in "Villa" , Trenker relocates the primary zone of
aesthetic
experiences,
moves it from the secluded spheres of bourgeois art to the
ordered ranges
of farm
life as seen through, as disciplined by, the surveying gaze
of the
patriarchal
autocrats.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
Yet its valorization of premodern orders of social
interaction is an illusion: the cinematic gaze of Sutter
does indeed
explode the
limits of bourgeois art, but simultaneously what has been
unleashed by the
hero's
imperial eyes is recontained in rigorous aesthetic
stratification. In
achieving
this, Sutter/Trenker enacts nothing less than a modernistic
attack on
autonomous
art, redefining art--like Borchardt--as "a practical
expression of power,
stripped of any commitments to emancipation."
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
In fundamental
accord
with Borchardt's and the political agendas of many other
modernist
authors, the
power of vision in <I>Der Kaiser von Kalifornien</I> endows
material
practices
with auratic enchantment and invests the social order with
aesthetic
import.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
Trenker's optical instruments summon forth elemental
and
untamed forces, yet in such a way that they picture the
West's natural and
social
topographies as a mesmerizing spectacle, as political
architectures that
render
power and art, form and domination, mutually exchangeable.
Trenker, who is
often
deemed an outright premodernist and traditionalist, marks
modern tools of
representation as vehicles that--in likeness to the social
practice of a
settler
or cowboy--transform hostile nature into an ordered garden,
vehicles that
invite
modern citizens to partake of charismatic experiences and
reverse their
discontent with modern civilization.

<p>
After the Stalingrad debacle, Adolf Hitler is said to have
ordered his
fatigued
general staff to read the <I>Winnetou</I> sequels by Karl
May in order to
boost
their morale.
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
Trenker's Western, however, represents a genre
with
far more complex effects. For him, the Western is not
intended to provide
imaginary escape from the routines of modern life, or to
lend mythic
formulas to
German realities. Rather, in the final analysis, <I>Der
Kaiser von
Kalifornien</I> turns an idealized image of the cowboy as
colonial
explorer into
an authoritative metaphor for the cinematic process in
general. Emulating
the
Western genre, German film here suggests that the cinematic
apparatus
itself, in
spite or even because of its intrinsically modern
technologies, operates
according to the same logic as once appeared in the ocular
regime of the
Far
West, in the Westerner's imperial gaze at pristine
landscapes and virtuous
farm
workers. Trenker's film does not simply seize the Western as
a source of
escapist
fantasies; quite the contrary, the West and its spectacle
defines the
generic
structures, the possibilities of film itself. What triumphs
at the end of
the
film is not so much Sutter's political intervention as the
logic of the
camera,
the film's continuous evocation of elemental forces and
their
recontainment in a
highly balanced and controlled mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. So
triumphant is the
victory
of Trenker's images that they can even outlive the
destruction of Sutter's
New
Helvetia. The final shot of Sutter as a trekking cowboy,
literally
projected on a
screen of clouds, articulates this powerful persistence of
the cinematic
image, a
triumph that rectifies the course of history even where
reality has gone
astray.
At the end of <I>Der Kaiser von Kalifornien,</I> after the
arrival of the 

<B></B>

greedy
Forty-Niners, there is indeed more to the picture than meets
the eye:
cinematic
images are to redeem the original thrust of colonial
enterprises, that
romantic
and imperialist search for a place in the sun. Trenker's
last shot
constructs
cinema as a site that preserves and transmits the visual
regimes, the
material
practices, the real virtues of Western heroes; the camera
sustains the
power of
colonial appropriation and stimulates contemporary
spectators to channel
their
energies into new geographical projects, whether at the
Western frontier
or the
Eastern front. Mobilizing images from the West, Trenker
creates a cinema of
mobilization.

<p>
Given the film's metacinematic interventions, it should come
as no
surprise that
one of the most memorable New Helvetia scenes is
unquestionably modelled
on a
sequence of <I>Triumph of the Will,</I> Leni Riefenstahl's
Nuremberg film
released only a few months before <I>Der Kaiser von
Kalifornien</I> went
into
production. In this sequence, Sutter descends from a log
cabin in order to
walk
along a line of workers eagerly shoveling an irrigation
canal. While he
offers
each worker a cigar, he asks his subjects for their
geographical origins,
prompting them to name a host of locations spread all over
central Europe.
Although executed with less cinematic artistry than its
textual
predecessor, this
scene conspicuously relocates Riefenstahl's labor-force
sequence from the
Nuremberg rally grounds to the shores of the Sacramento
River.
Riefenstahl's
Teutonic spade workers--soldiers in disguise--reemerge as
colonial heroes,
while
the power of Hitler's charismatic gaze, installed in
Riefenstahl's film on
an
elevated platform, is transferred to the patriarchal
demeanor of Johann
August
Sutter. In an astounding exercise of cinematic
intertextuality, the jargon
of
blood and soil, of regional authenticity, becomes the core
of California
politics. Although worlds seem to separate <I>Triumph of the
Will</I> and
<I>Der
Kaiser von Kalifornien,</I> given in particular
Riefenstahl's and Trenker's
mutual hostility, it is tenable to argue that both films in
fact represent
a
curious double, a pair of cinematic twins that document the
affinity of
propaganda movies and feature films in Nazi Germany. What
both films
celebrate is
more than the homogenizing effect of charismatic leadership,
strong enough
to
mold social and natural topographies into direct expressions
of power. What
triumphs in both films, the Western and the propaganda
spectacle, is also
and
foremost the power of the cinematic image, cinema defined as
a form of
colonization by other means, a technology whose very
apparatical logic
rejuvenates the resources for epic heroism, while it
paradoxically promises
redemption from the modern regimes of technological
mediation and
functional
differentiation. Like Richard Wagner's operatic modernism in
the
<I>Ring</I>
tetralogy, Westerns of the 1930s unleash a complex protest
against
modernity by
means of modernity's own tools of technological mediation
and
representation. Not
surprisingly, aural effects in Nazi Westerns--in particular
the operatic
score of
<I>Der Kaiser von Kalifornien,</I> furnished by Giuseppe
Becce--elevated
these
films' highly choreographed flow of images and ever-shifting
perspectives
to the
status of a total work of art, a spectacle of affective
enthrallment that
hoped
not only to address popular tastes and captivate emotions,
but to engineer
and
shape them.

It is worth noting that Trenker's <I>Der Kaiser von
Kalifornien,</I> in
addition to its highly instructive politics, deserves
special critical
attention
because it helped lay the foundation stone for the striking
triumph of
German
Western productions during the 1960s, which in turn
stimulated Italian
filmmakers
such as Sergio Corbucci, Damiano Damiani, and Sergio Leone
to produce
their so-
called Spaghetti Westerns around 1970. It is, of course, not
without irony
that
it was not the Third Reich but the Germany of Adenauer,
Erhard, and
Kiesinger
that was to furnish the framework for economically
successful films based
on Karl
May's turn-of-the-century fantasies. Between 1962 and 1968,
German film
studios
coproduced a total of no less than seventeen cinematic May
adaptions.
Mostly
directed by Harald Reinl, productions such as <I>Der Schatz
im
Silbersee</I> (The
Treasure in the Silver Sea, 1962), <I>Winnetou I-III</I>
(1963-65), <I>Old
Shatterhand</I> , and <I>Winnetou und Shatterhand im
Tal der
Toten</I>
(Winnetou and Shatterhand in the Valley of the Dead, 1968)
did more than
epitomize the escapist tendencies of what critical German
filmmakers of
the late
1960s and 1970s were to rebuke as "Papas Kino" (Dad's
movies). The
popularity of
these films also set a viable economic framework for the
German Western
mania of
the 1970s and early 1980s, culminating in the notorious
success of annual
Karl
May open-air festivals in Espe and Bad Segeberg, as well as
a
fourteen-sequel
television series based on May's novels in 1980. For an

Granted only thirty thousand dollars by Goebbels for
location work,
Trenker
filmed most of his California sequences in Italy. Yet while
he decided to
shoot
those sequences that depict nature as a prolific garden in
Borchardt's
Italian
countryside, Trenker significantly chose American locations
for scenes in
which
nature imposes threats and challenges on the film's trekking
hero, scenes
which
map nature as a hostile one. As Everson, in his enthusiastic
review,
narrates:
"Because of the lack of money, most of the film was shot in
Italy, wine
and grape
regions doubling rather well for the agricultural lands that
Sutter
created, and
actual buildings replacing sets where possible. The scenes
where the
<I>authentic
</I>West was essential (and which luckily required only
Trenker, one or two
players, some horses and a few wagons) were shot--and
superbly so--in the
West"
(Everson, "Luis Trenker," 278). For more on the production
context of
<I>Der
Kaiser von Kalifornien,</I> see Trenker's own (notoriously
unreliable)
account in

In a gesture of curious cultural receptivity, Hitler thus
promoted

<p>

At the end of the spectacular climbing sequence in the Grand
Canyon,
when
Sutter arrives at the canyon's rim and welcomes--in a
geographically rather
astounding move--his new California homeland, Becce's
soundtrack does not
even
hesitate to reach out for a perplexing aural hybridization,
a thematic
mixture of
the "Horst-Wessels-Leid" and the "Star-Spangled Banner"
<I>(SW,</I> 20).

<p>
Anyone embarking on a study of scholarship in the Third Reich may
encounter any
combination of strange bedfellows, as a recent event called to our
attention. In
June 1995, <I>The New York Times </I>reported a story about a prominent
German
professor of literature who had assumed a false identity in order not
to be
linked with his past associations with the SS. The branch to which he
belonged,
the <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> (Ancestral Heritage), was a research department
that
enlisted scholars from a variety of fields to investigate the Germanic
race in
all of its manifestations. The scholar, Hans Schwerter, alias Hans-Ernst
Schneider, faces accusations that he was responsible for supplying medical
equipment to be used for experiments on human subjects interned in
concentration
camps. The eighty-five-year-old professor emeritus and former rector
of the
Technical College in Aachen concedes that he changed his identity, but
insists
that his work with the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> focused mainly on folk
dances.
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
The Ancestral Heritage branch of the SS has been known to historians for
well
over twenty years through Michael Kater's painstaking reconstruction
of its
history and function in the Nazi state.
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
To the casual reader
of
<I>The New York Times,</I> however, the fact that the SS could
simultaneously
serve as the headquarters for organized mass murder and a research center
for
folk music poses a disturbing juxtaposition, and Schneider/ Schwerter's
explanation of his activities implies that we are to regard the two
activities of
the SS as mutually exclusive. A person who could immerse himself in the
harmless
and esoteric world of folk music could not possibly have any interest in
dehumanization, torture, and extermination. But 

<B></B>

cases of the harmless
coexisting
with the harmful, or of cultivation in an atmosphere of destruction,
complete the
list of Third Reich idiosyncrasies that range from individual
personalities to
entire organizations. We are allowed occasional glimpses of the elusive
personality of Hitler as a vegetarian and an avid dog lover, while the
quaint,
manicured flower gardens gracing the headquarters at Auschwitz are
maintained to
this day to drive home the irony of their presence.

<p>
The gross incongruities of the simultaneous cultivation of beauty,
art, and
knowledge alongside cruelty, destruction, and indoctrination spread into
the
realm of music, one of the most prized cultural treasures of Germany, and
music
scholarship, a discipline in which German scholars had played a leading
role from
the very beginning. Music had come to be regarded as central to defining
the
German nation in the era leading up to unification in 1871, preoccupying
philosophers and novelists, and persisting as a key component in
developing a
national identity, especially after the defeat in World War
I.
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The
music policy of the Nazi government further promoted art music as
Germany's
cultural showpiece and cultivated amateur music and music education as a
central
daily activity, taking more care than its forerunners to sustain
orchestras,
opera houses, and choral and chamber groups in every town, great and
small, and
even rescuing private and semiprivate musical operations such as the
Bayreuth
Festival and the Berlin Philharmonic from total ruin by making them wards
of the
state.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
But these measures were not without their own
ironies: while
stripping Jewish citizens of all rights and possessions, the government
also made
sure that the Jews had their own outlet for musical expression in the
Jewish
Culture League (J&uuml;discher Kulturbund), which allowed Jewish-staffed
theater
and opera companies, symphony orchestras, cabaret, and numerous choral and
chamber music groups to perform Jewish works to Jewish audiences from 1933
to
1941.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Even in the concentration camps, bands and orchestras
made up
of inmates were vigilantly maintained in at least twenty locations, called
upon
to entertain SS officers stationed there and to drown out the sounds of
torture.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Music scholarship also received unprecedented state support after Hitler
came to
power, despite the reputed anti-intellectual foundations of Nazi ideology
and
policy, and also became an accomplice to acts of racism and exploitation.
Musicology had been in many ways a "German discipline," with
German-speaking
scholars at the forefront of methodological and organizational
developments,
initiating large-scale research projects, periodicals, and publication
series.
The Nazi state and party invested much time and money into building up
research
facilities and employing musicologists, especially in capacities outside
the
university. In addition to <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> support for research, the
education ministry revived a dying musicological institute in
B&uuml;ckeburg and
expanded and reestablished it in Berlin as the State Institute for German
Music
Research (Staatliches Institut f&uuml;r deutsche Musikforschung); the
propaganda
ministry funded musicological projects and employed musicologists as
consultants,
and the German Labor Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront) relied on
musicologists'
collaboration for its education and recreational programs, such as the
"Strength
through Joy" program (NS-Gemeinschaft Kraft 

<B></B>

 durch
Freude). At the same time
Alfred Rosenberg, in his watch-dog function as "Deputy to the F&uuml;hrer
for the
Supervision of the Total Intellectual and Ideological Training and
Education of
the National Socialist German Workers' Party," enlisted a small army of
music
scholars to evaluate each others' works, to compile ideologically sound
music
reference works (such as the <I>Lexikon der Juden in der Musik</I>
[Lexicon of
Jews in Music], a practical guide for hunting down Jews active in musical
life),
and to assist in the plundering of Jewish homes and libraries in occupied
regions.

<p>
Why should this regime, whose primary goals were military expansion,
industrial
and technological growth, control of public opinion, and racial
purification, be
so interested in investing in a small, esoteric humanities discipline such
as
musicology? That the Nazi state paid more attention to musicology than
prior
regimes might be explained with the same reasons for its investment in
music
performance: to present a high level of cultural achievement before the
critical
eye of the outside world. But musicology was still a relatively new field.
It
lacked influence in universities and among the music public, and it was of
little
apparent use to the practical needs of the Nazi state. Why did the state
and
party nevertheless continue to channel resources into detailed research on
folk
music and music history, even at the height of a costly war?

<p>
This issue brings us face to face with the fundamental paradox that has
made the
Third Reich phenomenon so difficult to penetrate: how do you rationalize
the
enviable history of Germany as a bastion of intellectual and artistic
achievement
with the barbarities of the darkest chapter in its history? It is a
contradiction
that has let so many confrontations with this period lapse into
emotionally
charged condemnation, on the one hand, and defensiveness, on the other.
The fact
remains that the Nazi regime allowed the best and the worst of German
society to
coexist, even within the same organization, and the <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I>
illustrates one such harmonious relationship between the most notorious
perpetrators of racial prejudice and genocide and some of the most
privileged
heirs to the noble German intellectual tradition. The success of this
relationship can be explained only by a complex and deeply-rooted
interdependence
that touches on pragmatism, mutual exploitation, and common long-term
goals.

<p>
The Nazi government has earned the reputation of an anti-intellectual
regime, but
most university professionals would have argued that anti-intellectualism
was the
property of the Weimar Republic. The growing industry-based economy
spearheaded
by Bismarck was already threatening to diminish the importance of
intellectuals
as the bearers of culture, and the establishment of the Republic in 1918
was
perceived as a direct affront to the university, an institution based
on an
inherently antidemocratic power structure that concentrated decision
making in
the hands of a few professors.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
The majority of the academic
elite
resisted change and accepted the Republic, if at all, only out of
necessity.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The Weimar government's attempts at 

<B></B>

 reforms in
higher
education were met with vehement disapproval: when the Prussian
Minister of
Culture C. H. Becker, overseeing more than half of the universities in the
Reich,
tried to reform the curriculum by suggesting remedies for
overspecialization and
alienation from the needs of the public, he piqued the anger of professors
who
accused him of promoting marxism, materialism, and positivism, and seeking
to
undermine German <I>Kultur.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
Yet musicologists did not fit neatly into the mold of the conservative,
antidemocratic Weimar professor. Musicology was still relatively new
to the
university and was eyed with some mistrust by other academics. The
function of
the musicologist was also somewhat loosely defined, with trained
musicologists
finding homes in the university, the conservatory, and journalism. And
because
the musicology professor was a direct descendent of the practicing music
director
rather than the music theorists of the Middle Ages, musicology's status in
the
university remained ambiguous well into the first decades of the twentieth
century.
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Relative novelty and lack of professional definition
explain why many of the pioneer scholars failed to rise in the university
ranks;
why music criticism, as had long been the case, continued to supplement
the
income of even the most famous university professors; and why professors
of
musicology could still be practicing musicians and composers without
lowering
themselves in the eyes of their colleagues. More important, it also
explains why
musicologists were more flexible in listening to and acting on the demands
of the
Weimar state to meet the needs of the public, in contrast to the
reactionary
response of the majority of university professors in older, more firmly
entrenched disciplines.

<p>
The musicology community, seeing employment options shrink as veterans
returned
from the front and the German economy weakened, gave serious thought
to the
general call to emerge from the ivory tower.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
They aired their
concerns about the relevance of their work in the popular press and a
growing
number of nonacademic specialized journals.
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Some highlighted
musicology's educational function of making the common music lover an
educated
listener and offered direct suggestions for music education
policies.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Others recommended that the government pursue
programs to
make use of the trained musicologist's qualifications: programs to
cultivate folk
music, organize public concerts in urban centers and smaller towns and
villages,
and provide lectures and workshops in music appreciation.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
The musical needs of Weimar Germany were also changing. Military
defeat and
modernization had intensified longing for lost national pride and
nostalgia for
simpler times. Rising tensions among social and political factions
inspired many
to search for ways to bring Germans together: music was widely promoted as
holding the key to healing the wounds of a split society and promoting
feelings
of camaraderie. Amateur organizations such as the German Federation of
Workers'
Choral Societies (Deutsche Arbeiter S&auml;ngerbund) were already
demonstrating
that choral singing could bring people of all social classes together in a
class-blind communal activity.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The Youth Movement
(Jugendbewegung)
made music making one of its central activities, and music education rose
to
prominence on the government's agenda and enjoyed sweeping reforms in the
1920s.
Indeed, by 1931 choral groups could account for the participation 

<B></B>

 of
perhaps two
million German citizens, and the membership in these groups ignored
political and
social boundaries. A proliferation of instrumental music making in and
outside
the home suggests the degree to which music had become part of the daily
German
fare.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
In response, musicologists began to take a great
interest in
amateur music making, an interest that was to continue beyond 1933. The
rapidly
growing Youth Music Movement (Jugendmusikbewegung) and the revival of
private
music making <I>(Hausmusik)</I> held a special attraction for
musicologists.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
They encouraged the performance of early
music and
stimulated demand for early music and folk music editions.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
This postwar upsurge of musical activity further reinforced the Germans'
reputation as <I>the</I> musical nation, the <I>Volk der Musik,</I> and
focused
more attention on the questions of what made the Germans so musical and
what made
German music "German." Music lovers and musicologists increasingly turned
their
attention to the history and nature of German music, partly in response to
the
public need to understand and reaffirm the identity of Germany as a
nation, and
partly out of the isolation caused by the war that cut scholars off from
international contacts. Wartime travel restrictions had forced music
researchers
to become acquainted with their own musical resources and to focus
on local
studies out of economic necessity, and the postwar resentment among
colleagues in
former enemy countries fueled feelings of nationalist
isolation.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
The founders of major scholarly institutions and periodicals emerging
immediately
after the war adopted a mission of promoting German scholars and work on
German
topics, and the record of publications clearly indicates an ever
increasing
engagement with German music from 1918 to 1945, at least in quantitative
terms.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Musicology's focus on German music history accompanied an avid interest in
German
folk music. Folk music had long been regarded as a symbol of German
national
identity and unity, and a serious interest in German folk music continued
to be
one of the most powerful signals that musicology could serve the needs of
the
German nation. The nineteenth-century glorification of folk culture had
developed
into a large-scale effort to collect and preserve folk music, and the
fruits of
these labors, housed in archives in Freiburg and Berlin, offered
musicologists a
potential source for uncovering the mysteries of German musical strength.
It was
assumed that folk music, unlike art music, was pure and sheltered from
foreign
influences, especially among the populations of isolated ethnic-German
enclaves
<I>(Auslandsdeutschtum),</I> who had to struggle to preserve their German
folk
culture. Scholars worked on the now discredited assumption that folk music
was
stagnant and therefore could represent the closest approximation to some
sort of
"ur-German" music.

II. Musicology and the New Regime
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
By the time Hitler came to power, German musicologists had already
demonstrated
their willingness to use their skills for the needs of the nation, both
practical
and ideological. 

<B></B>

 Immediately thereafter, the
musicological establishment
made
political gestures to indicate its willingness to work together with the
regime.
In July 1933 the German Music Society (Deutsche Musikgesellschaft), the
scholarly
society for musicologists, dismissed the Jewish editor of its journal,
officially
dissolved itself, and reorganized under the name of Deutsche Gesellschaft
f&uuml;r Musikwissenschaft (German Society for Musicology) with a charter
based
on the National Socialist leadership principle (F&uuml;hrerprinzip). It
then
offered its services to the state in a letter to the propaganda minister.
It
later held its first conference in the new Reich at the large music
festival in
D&uuml;sseldorf, the 1938 Reich Music Days (Reichsmusiktage), also home of
the
notorious exhibit <I>Degenerate Music</I> (Entartete Musik) that vilified
alleged
Jewish influences in popular and art music. The meeting's central
theme was
"Music and Race," the title of one session and of the keynote speech by
Kiel
professor Friedrich Blume. The other sessions centered on popular research
areas
that were becoming central to musicological scholarship and were deemed
important
for the needs of the state: "German Music," "German Masters," "State and
Music,"
"Questions for Music Research."
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
The Nazi government, for its part, showed more concern than its
forerunners had
for the future of musicology. The government had adopted a policy of
making room
for the next generation (Nachwuchsf&ouml;rderung, or promotion of
progeny),
encouraging and sometimes forcing older scholars to retire from university
posts,
and the younger generation responded enthusiastically in the first few
years by
pledging to commit their work to the service of the German <I>Volk</I> and
the
Nazi state.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
The propaganda ministry and other branches of the
government and party offered a surprising amount of support to
musicologists,
especially when their work contributed toward understanding the German
musical
heritage or cultivating German music in the public arena. They even made
provisions for employing some of the overflow of trained musicologists
with
specially created nonacademic posts.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
A separate music
department in
the propaganda ministry sponsored or cosponsored a number of musicological
publishing projects: editions of the complete works of Gl&uuml;ck and
Bruckner, a
multivolume collection of German folk songs, and a collection of essays by
musicologists who used historical evidence to demonstrate Germany's
presence in
the musical culture of countries annexed or under occupation by
1944.
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The propaganda ministry enlisted other musicologists as
part-time consultants,
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
and one well-known scholar, Hans
Joachim
Moser, managed to secure a full-time position in the propaganda ministry
with the
creation of the Reich Department for Musical Arrangements (Reichsstelle
f&uuml;r
Musikbearbeitungen), established to furnish the repertoire of opera houses
and
concert halls with "acceptable" works.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
The state's grandest gesture of support for musicology was the
resurrection of
the all-but-defunct Royal Institute for German Music Research
(F&uuml;rstliches
Institut f&uuml;r deutsche Musikforschung) in B&uuml;ckeburg. The Nazi
education
minister moved the dying institute to Berlin in 1935, adding on the Berlin
folk
music archive, the renowned music instrument collection, a number of
editing
projects and periodicals, and a new department for folk-music research.
The Nazi
party also had its uses for 

<B></B>

 musicologists' skills,
as in the tasks
performed for
Alfred Rosenberg's watchdog organization for spotting ideological
transgressions.
The Rosenberg Bureau (Amt Rosenberg) had its own music department, which
supported a small number of research and publishing projects and enlisted
dozens
of musicologists for evaluating works for ideological propriety, supplying
data
to complete its <I>Lexicon of Jews in Music,</I> and contributing to the
Nazi
party's planned elite Party University (Hohe Schule der
Partei).
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Rosenberg's wartime operational staff carried out a mission to seize
valuable
property in occupied territories under the premise of supplying the
library of
the Party University as well as state libraries and museums, and had a
special
musical staff (Sonderstab Musik) that engaged musicologists to assess the
value
of seized items for their potential use for musicological research,
sending
scholars to Poland, Belgium, France, Holland, and the Baltic
states.

III. The <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> and Music Research
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The SS, in addition to carrying out police terror and the ruthlessly
efficient
operation of death camps, was a highly complex mass organization.
Historians have
called it the "SS state," noting its size, complexity, and status as a
state
within the state, immune to the legal and judicial system of the Reich,
free to
impose its own physical, mental, and ideological standards for its elite
members,
to run its own military units, and to develop its own science, education,
culture, and rituals.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
The research unit known as the
<I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> grew out of Himmler's own intellectual aspirations. He
had
long fancied himself a historian and took a keen interest in furthering a
general
knowledge of Germanic prehistory. Sharing these goals was Richard Walther
Darr&eacute;, the architect of the "blood and soil" mythology and agrarian
policies of the Nazi party and head of the SS Headquarters for Race and
Resettlement (Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt/RuSHA); the two supported the
amateur
historian Hermann Wirth in the formation of the <I>Deutsches Ahnenerbe</I>
in
1935. This was to be a "scientific" society dedicated to studying the
history of
the Germanic race, attached to Darr&eacute;'s RuSHA and funded largely by
his
agricultural office.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Himmler eventually pushed out these
cofounders
and absorbed the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> into his personal staff, making himself
head
with limitless powers. He surrounded himself with reputable scholars to
run the
scientific side of the organization and hired a dedicated assistant,
Wolfram
Sievers, to oversee administrative matters.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
The
<I>Ahnenerbe</I>
strove to be a quintessentially interdisciplinary undertaking, involving
natural
sciences, social sciences, and humanities disciplines in a collaborative
setting
to achieve a complete understanding of the Germanic race.

<p>
These grand designs of accumulating a comprehensive knowledge of the
Germanic
race extended into forming a broad conception of "Germanic" music, and
musicologists who could demonstrate the appropriate interests were in an
especially favorable position to receive financial backing from Himmler's
coffers. Such interests included reconstructing the music of prehistoric
Germanic
tribes, seeking out the essence of German music in both folk and art
repertoires,
or determining 

<B></B>

 Germanic influences in presumably
non-Germanic musical
sources
such as Gregorian chant. The <I>Ahnenerbe</I> funded research projects,
facilitated travel abroad, subsidized book publications, and solicited
musicological contributions for its in-house journals. Fritz Bose,
a young,
ambitious scholar who cultivated a long-term relationship with the SS in
the
hopes of establishing a position within the organization, took on a wide
variety
of assignments, all in some way related to the musicological goals of the
organization. Bose's first project consisted of a research trip to Finland
in the
summer of 1936 to evaluate folk music materials. When he reported that
their
value for understanding prehistoric Nordic culture could be assessed only
through
comparative studies with the folk music of such regions as Iceland and the
Faroe
Islands, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> contacted Wilhelm Heinitz for copies of his
recordings of folk music from the Faroe Islands, a part of its larger goal
to
collect examples from the entire spectrum of German folk
music.
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Bose was also assigned to conduct research on the lur, a bronze-age
instrument
always found in pairs and so presumed to provide early evidence for the
origins
of polyphony. In scholarly and popular literature, the lur had become
symbolic of
the cultural advances of Germanic tribes, and in 1932 the influential
amateur
musicologist Richard Eichenauer concluded on the basis of such speculation
that
consonance and the triad must be Germanic inventions.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
From
then on,
the instrument represented proof of a Germanic racial trait dictating a
preference for consonance and an inborn aversion to "Jewish
atonalism."
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> entrusted Bose with the
task of
researching and reproducing models of the instrument. After commissioning
a
reproduction of the instrument, Bose went on to refute claims that the lur
was
not used as a musical instrument or that it was fashioned after an
oriental
prototype.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Other musicologists profited from <I>Ahnenerbe</I> publishing outlets. In
its
first years leading up to the war, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> had established
three
journals (the monthly <I>Germanien, </I>and two journals dedicated to
genealogy,
<I>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Namen-forschung</I> and <I>Das Sippenzeichen),</I>
its
own publishing house in Berlin-Dahlem, and a publication series of
monographs in
the humanities, and was coproducing several highly-respected scholarly
periodicals. After a rejection from the music publisher B&auml;renreiter,
Joseph
M&uuml;ller-Blattau, head of the musicology department in Freiburg,
presented his
book <I>Germanisches Erbe in deutscher Tonkunst</I> (Germanic Heritage in
Musical
Compositions) to the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> and won acceptance into its
publication
series.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The study uses examples of folk music, lullabies, and
children's songs to reconstruct Germanic prehistoric music and to derive
melodic
gestures that can be found throughout German art music. Himmler even
personally
requested that M&uuml;ller-Blattau be persuaded to work for the
organization, but
the discovery of his pre-1933 connections to Jews, democrats, and
communists, his
support of atonality and psychological methods, and his reputation as a
political
chameleon seem to have worked against him.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

<p>
The scholar who enjoyed the most publishing opportunities from the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I> was Hans Joachim Moser. From 1938 through 1940 he was a
regular
contributor to 

<B></B>

 the periodical <I>Germanien,</I>
edited by folklorist
Joseph Otto
Pla&szlig;mann. Moser supplied articles on the history of military music,
folk
songs, fundamental elements of German music, and the music of lands
recently
annexed or occupied by German troops.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
He was skillful in
quickly
furnishing contributions that would reinforce Germany's military advances
with
historical evidence of early German musical presence in these regions. In
September 1938, the same month as the Munich agreement, Moser offered to
write an
article on Sudeten-German music history, and by October 1939, one month
after the
invasion of Poland, Moser had submitted a similar article on
Danzig.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Two of Moser's <I>Germanien</I> articles, the
Sudeten-German essay and another that praised the events of the
<I>Anschluss</I>
with Austria, were reprinted in the special <I>Ahnenerbe</I> publication
celebrating the "homecoming" of Austria and the Sudetenland back into the
German
Reich.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Then, in the spring of 1939, after beginning to write
a
series of articles on the history of German military songs, Moser took
note of
the rapid increase in military gains and asked the editor Pla&szlig;mann
"would<I> you rather have in the meantime a more politically topical essay
on the
Flemish-Dutch-German musical connection?</I> Also one on the musical
<I>culture-bridge</I> to Scandinavia would certainly be feasible" (italics
in
original).
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
His letter was written shortly after the
occupation of
Denmark in April 1940 and preceded the offensive on Belgium and Holland by
five
days.

<p>
After the war was in full force, musicological undertakings sponsored by
the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I> focused more on the immediate tasks of gathering
information in
territories outside the Reich, where the SS could exercise its special
privileges. Only months after the outbreak of the war, Himmler used his
position
as Reich Commissioner for Securing German Nationhood (Reichskommissar
f&uuml;r
die Festigung deutschen Volkstums/RFK) to assume control over the seizure
of
arable land, and in December 1939 he extended this jurisdiction to the
seizure of
cultural property. <I>Ahnenerbe</I> actions thereafter concentrated on
"securing," i.e. seizing, cultural property (a direct violation of the
Hague
Convention) from Poland, Russia, South Tyrol, and parts of Yugoslavia
which
supposedly bore relevance for the study of the Germanic race, and setting
up
facilities for imposing German culture on the "Germanic" countries under
occupation (Norway, Holland, Denmark, Belgium). The <I>Ahnenerbe</I>
intensified
its activities in the humanities more than in the natural sciences
in these
years, and, owing to the special status of the SS, many of its researchers
could
carry out their work in some form or another during the war and avoid
military
service by virtue of Himmler's consecrating their activities as "war
essential"
<I>(kriegswichtig; DAS,</I> 145).

<p>
Most of the music-related wartime projects of the <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I>
concentrated on folk-music research rather than the acquisition of
valuable
artifacts. While most other <I>Ahnenerbe</I> wartime initiatives
concentrated on
seizing, assessing, and transporting "Germanic" property into Germany,
musicologists tended toward a more literal execution of "preservation" of
the
"Germanic" heritage, concentrating on recording and transcribing the folk
music
of the surviving ethnic German communities rather than seizing physical
property.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Even while some SS officers took the 

<B></B>

 trouble to
assess
property for its potential value to music scholarship, most of the
activity of
musicologists themselves focused on field research.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
Although the war caused the termination of Bose's work in Finland, German
military advances opened up research opportunities on other fronts, and
the plans
to transfer populations created a pressing need to document the folk music
of
ethnic Germans selected for resettlement.
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
The initial
suggestion
for an aggressive campaign to collect folk music from ethnic Germans came
from
the musicologists themselves. Already in February 1940, Fritz Bose
was ever
vigilant of new opportunities and, within days of the termination of his
Finland
research, he wrote to Sievers with suggestions for extending the
definition of
"cultural property" to the performance realm, i.e. recording folk music
and folk
dances of Volhynian and Baltic ethnic Germans in resettlement camps,
and of
ethnic Germans in former Poland, Galicia, the Carpathian mountains, and
South
Tyrol. Bose recommended that the project be carried out as soon as
possible,
before resettlement disrupted the lives of the subjects; that it
become the
domain of the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> rather than a university, where it might be
neglected; and that he be entrusted with the supervision of the
project.
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
But another musicologist, Alfred Quellmalz, had
applied to
the Ethnic German Liaison Office (Volksdeutsche Mittlestelle) ten days
before the
date of Bose's letter and, in early March, was able to carry out a similar
project in the resettlement camps of the Volhynian and Galician
Germans.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
The involvement of Quellmalz in SS-work led to the most extensive
musicological
projects under the <I>Ahnenerbe.</I> Quellmalz was head of the folk music
department in the State Institute for German Music Research. By employing
him
full time, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> forged a mutually beneficial collaboration
with
the institute and could make full use of its resources. Immediately after
the
completion of the Volhynian-Galician project, Quellmalz embarked on what
was to
become the largest musicological venture supported by the
<I>Ahnenerbe:</I> the
collection of folk materials from the ethnic Germans in South Tyrol.
Following a
1939 agreement between Germany and Italy, the German-speaking inhabitants
of
South Tyrol were given the option to resettle in the German Reich. After
an
overwhelming majority voted in favor of resettlement, Himmler supervised
the
transfer and used his position to benefit the <I>Ahnenerbe.</I> His
"cultural
commission" set about zealously to photograph, transcribe, or otherwise
document
all cultural property that the Italians would not let out of the country
because
it was not in the private possession of the settlers. The <I>Ahnenerbe</I>
worked
so assiduously in documenting Italian possessions that they felt it unwise
to let
the Italian officials know of the extent of their work.
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
In the end, the recording and transcribing of folk music in South Tyrol
lasted
from June 1940 until December 1942. By that time, Quellmalz's staff
grew to
include eight collaborators working on folk songs, instrumental music,
folk
dances, children's songs and games, and music history. They scoured the
entire
South Tyrolean countryside, making sound recordings of vocal and
instrumental
music, photocopies of manuscripts and printed songbooks, transcriptions,
and
silent films of folk dances, games, plays, and instrumental techniques, as
well
as photographing their subjects 

<B></B>

 and collecting
their biographical data in
order
to learn more about their racial and sociological
composition.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

<p>
The gains for historical musicology from the South Tyrol project were
significant
as well, yielding the discovery of a wide range of valuable sources in
Italian
archives. The wealth of available material compelled Quellmalz to request
that
the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> engage another assistant to document these historical
sources. This information would benefit Quellmalz personally, aiding him
in the
research for his own postdoctoral thesis (the <I>Habilitationsschrift,</I>
required of assistant professors for promotion), and allowing him to widen
his
own sphere of influence into chant research and to gain the services of
another
assistant working exclusively on that area.
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
Himmler was reputed to have a special interest in Gregorian chant
research, and
musicologists used that knowledge to try to secure support from the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I> for chant projects, particularly if they could use this
research
to determine Germanic influences. Karl Gustav Fellerer had already pursued
that
direction in his <I>Deutsche Gregorianik im Frankenreich</I> (German Chant
in the
Frankish Empire) and his continuing research into the German elements in
Gregorian chant in Holland and Flanders; and Ewald Jammers had completed a
similar study, <I>Die v&ouml;lkische Zugeh&ouml;rigkeit des
gregorianischen
Chorals</I> (National Correlation in Gregorian Chant). Quellmalz went to
great
lengths to try to secure the publication of Jammers's book, intended for a
series
edited by Friedrich Blume entitled <I>Schriften zur musikalischen Volks-
und
Rassenkunde</I> (Publications on Musical Nationality and Race Studies),
but held
up by paper shortages. He sought the intervention of the SS Central
Security
Office (Sicherheitshauptamt) and the cosponsorship of the <I>Ahnenerbe</I>
to
push the project through, all under the premise of Himmler's special
concern for
Gregorian chant.
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--_a-head-->
IV. A Pragmatic Working Relationship
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The seemingly mismatched collaboration between musicologists and Himmler's
SS
operations begins to make sense when we consider some of the practical
potential
gains for each side. From the perspective of musicologists, the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I>
offered several attractive opportunities. As a source of research funding,
it
held many advantages over more conventional sources, since the SS had a
special
status and could circumvent visa and currency complications often
encountered by
scholars applying for research trips abroad.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
Furthermore, in
terms
of research areas, musicologists were not so restricted as one might
think. Such
were the experiences of musicologist Johann Schottl&auml;nder, who
successfully
appealed to Himmler for travel money for research on ancient Greek
notation in
Greece, Switzerland, and Italy after the German Research Council (Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft) turned him down, believing his plans to be too
ambitious.
The SS was willing not only to fund his research, but also to consider
publishing
his results as part of an <I>Ahnenerbe</I> series.
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>

<p>
Younger scholars had lived through a difficult period of underemployment
and seen the first signs of a turnaround with the stated policy of
<I>Nachwuchsf&ouml;rderung</I> 

<B></B>

 and the removal of
the small number of Jews
who
occupied academic posts. For them, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> was a way of
procuring
research support, enhancing their publication records, and ultimately
linking up
with a powerful political influence that could lead to university
employment.
Fritz Bose, for example, recognized the power of the SS, and tried to
harness it
toward his advancement. He asked to be employed officially by the SS, but
made it
clear that he wanted to preserve his university ties by continuing to
perform his
functions at the Berlin acoustics institute on a voluntary basis, to give
lectures, to proceed with his <I>Habilitation,</I> "and--if it please the
gods--some day to become a real professor."
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
During the war, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> was especially attractive for the
special
privileges the SS offered those under its protection. Scholars could avail
themselves of research sources in politically volatile regions
inaccessible to
other researchers, and in some cases they could continue working in their
chosen
field while being exempted from military service. Quellmalz justified his
prolonged absence from the State Institute to the education ministry by
explaining that this was a unique opportunity to collect material and
study the
culture of a previously inaccessible German enclave, and that the RFK had
arranged for his release from military service to continue with the
work.
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Erich Schenk, head of the musicology department in
Vienna,
saw an opportunity to exploit the SS presence in Italy and proposed a
collaboration between his department (along with its existing research
center in
Florence) and the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> to investigate "Germanic remnants" in
Italian
music from the sixth century to the sixteenth century.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Even
though
his main research interests and that of his Florence center were the
origins of
the classical style, he framed his proposal in terms that would appeal to
Himmler's Germanic interests. The <I>Ahnenerbe</I> was initially
interested,
owing to Himmler's "special interest in questions of Gregorian chant," but
realized that Schenk wanted only to forge a relationship with the SS to
take
advantage of its political influence in Italy.
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>

<p>
From the SS perspective, musicology was important because it promised to
realize
the SS desire for comprehensiveness. The interest in musicology, in other
words,
was probably part of a grander scheme to amass total control over German
intellectual life, competing with the education ministry, the propaganda
ministry, and especially the Rosenberg Bureau. Although prior
investigations into
the goals of the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> do not explore the musicology connection
in
detail, many of their conclusions can apply to musicology. Anke Oesterle,
relying
largely on Kater's work, looked specifically at the relationship between
the SS
and folklorists to conclude that a prime motivation for SS interest in the
humanities was sheer competition with Rosenberg for greater spheres of
influence
and intellectual prestige. In the course of a few years, the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I>
gave the appearance of being more flexible and allowing for more
intellectual
freedom (particularly after Himmler placed its direction in the hands of a
renowned scholar, Walter W&uuml;st) in order to attract as many reputable
scholars as possible.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
Yet a mere desire for total control fails to account fully for the
SS-musicology
bond, particularly when we compare musicologists' activities with those of
other 

<B></B>

humanities scholars in the <I>Ahnenerbe.</I> According to the list of its
objectives in occupied areas and in northern Italy, the SS generally
sought not
only to plunder but also to establish a working relationship with
indigenous
populations, carrying out the "cultural-political" tasks of fostering
cooperation
and "educating" ethnic German natives to the National Socialist worldview.
But
Oesterle's analysis of folklorists indicates that they ignored the
"cultural-political" part of their assignment and concentrated on
acquiring
material objects. Folklorists, in short, used their work in South Tyrol to
rationalize their greed for Italian cultural property with alleged
scholarly
pursuits.
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>

<p>
Musicologists, by contrast, showed themselves to be far more serious about
the
"cultural-political" tasks of the venture. Their South Tyrolean campaign
involved
the feverish collection and documentation of melodies and folk practices.
Musicologists came into close contact with the natives and exploited their
presence to spread the gospel of Germanization to the South Tyroleans.
Quellmalz
and Bose lectured on folk music to capacity crowds throughout the region,
another
staff member led folk dancing courses, and the entire group ran a
week-long
folk-music retreat in the summer of 1941. It was by virtue of the
"national-political" <I>(volkspolitisch)</I> importance of these
tasks that
Quellmalz was relieved of some of his military service, with the
understanding
that he could be called upon at any time to carry out SS assignments of
"cultural
propaganda" in the occupied territories.
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
For the SS,
musicologists
were more than just diligent scholars who could broaden the scope of the
<I>Ahnenerbe</I> and lend intellectual credibility to Himmler's operation.
In
musicologists the SS found a commitment that extended beyond detailed
research
into the application of their findings as consultants and administrators
in the
Germanization of the expanding Reich.

<p>
That musicologists demonstrated more commitment to the so-called
"national-political" <I>(volkspolitisch)</I> or "cultural-political"
<I>(kulturpolitisch)</I> goals of the SS<I> </I>than the folklorists
relates back
to the special nature of musicology as a newcomer to the academy,
preserving its
ties to music practice. These differences are revealed most clearly in the
approaches to folk-music research, an area in which musicologists
demonstrated an
emotional investment and a drive to bridge the gap between theory and
practice.
For many musicologists of this generation, the earliest exposure to folk
music
was through extracurricular involvement with the Youth Music Movement as
leaders
and consultants.
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
By some of their later admissions, they had
felt
restricted by traditional subject areas forced upon them, while the
amateur music
movement pursued its own agenda.
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
M&uuml;ller-Blattau, for
example,
confessed that as a student of the "strict science" of historical
musicology
before World War I, he was baffled by the gap between scholarship and
practice.
His experiences as a soldier reawakened in him the importance of communal
singing
of folk songs for building camaraderie, nostalgia, and patriotism. He and
his
generation resolved to reform musicology, closing the gap with music
making and
raising folk music to a respectable subject worthy of study, and the
National
Socialist revolution finally made this possible.
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
When musicologists grew more interested in folk music, they were inspired
by the
current movements in amateur music practice as well as their
disappointment with
existing methodologies.
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
In their view, the nonmusicologists
who had
dominated folk-song research had neglected the "song" factor, paying far
more
attention to text than to melody. The scholarly study of folk song had for
too
long been the exclusive domain of Germanists and later folklorists who
subjected
their material to strict philological treatment and sterile
classification. They
had also forgotten the "folk" factor, producing meaningless work because
it did
not originate in an intimate relationship with the communities producing
the
music.
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>

<p>
After 1933, those who outlined the tasks, goals, and achievements of
musicology
in the new state highlighted the importance of folk music for the entire
discipline.
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
The education ministry's establishment of a
department
of German folk music in the State Institute made it possible to realize
the plans
to reform the discipline that M&uuml;ller-Blattau had articulated, by
consolidating resources in one location and by indicating the state's
support for
work in that direction. By the time Kurt Huber (best known as a martyr
executed
for his involvement with the "White Rose" student resistance movement)
became
director of the institute's folk music division in March 1937, he had been
vocal
in promoting a methodology that would reveal the "German folk-soul"
<I>(deutsche
Volksseele)</I> and would make folk music accessible to the public. The
scholar,
in his view, bore the responsibility of dictating the "purity" of folk
song by
weeding out destructive, parasitic obscenities and sentimentalities found
in
ballads, cabaret, and popular songs.
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
Other musicologists who
were
simultaneously involved in practical activities followed suit, promoting
an
"applied" science of folk music research that would involve musicologists
in
education, adult education, and the everyday music making of state, party,
public, and private institutions.
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>

<p>
The central research facility in Berlin laid the scholarly groundwork for
the
serious study of German folk music, and the <I>SS-Ahnenerbe</I> provided
the
means for field research that would allow musicologists to conduct their
work
along the lines they desired: establishing an intimate relationship with
the
originating communities, amassing large amounts of material, and
ultimately
processing that material for the practical use of the growing number of
amateur,
state, party, and military musical groups.

V. Music in the Creation of a Germanic Cult
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The significance of folk music as conceived by the SS, it must be noted,
had its
own peculiar emphasis. While Himmler was known to have a special interest
in folk
songs, the SS's concerns were part of a larger scheme to define the
Germanic
race, and the focus on folk music was arrived at only later as the most
efficient
means toward that end, after investing in such obscure historical projects
as the
reconstruction of the lur.

<p>
Setting out with a vague goal of determining the musical manifestations of
the
Germanic race, the initial plans for musicological research within the SS
centered on forming a research staff to investigate "Nordic" music, a
commission
that remained 

<B></B>

 unstaffed.
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
In the course of the war, the
terminology
shifted to concentrate on "Indo-germanic" music, and the SS organizers
decided,
somewhat arbitrarily, that "only folk music could contribute to this area"
<I>(DAS,</I> 194).
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
Himmler appointed Quellmalz, a folk music
expert, as the new director of the Research Center for
Indo-Germanic/Germanic
Music (Forschungsst&auml;tte f&uuml;r indogermanisch-deutsche Musik), with
plans
to extend future folk music research into Scandinavia, Holland, and
Belgium.
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
A comprehensive overview of folk music, alleged to
be a
pure manifestation of Germanic music, would hold the key to compiling a
musical
picture of the collective Germanic race, and the concentrated effort in
the South
Tyrolean enclave followed the corollary that ethnic German enclaves had
managed
to preserve purer manifestations of their Germanness in their efforts to
ward off
encroaching foreign influences.

<p>
Despite the wartime concentration on folk music, the <I>Ahnenerbe</I> did
not
entirely ignore historical pursuits. As late as 1942 it established a
precedent
by encouraging research on topics dating earlier than the year
1300.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
Even projects so seemingly remote from SS aims as
Schottl&auml;nder's work on ancient Greek notation were deemed relevant,
for they
were part of a process of thoroughly scrutinizing the early history of
Europe to
detect any traits which could, by any stretch of the imagination, be
interpreted
as Germanic. The ultimate goal of the SS, after purifying the German
population
of all undesirable elements, was to create an entire Germanic cult with
its own
rituals and history, and to draw up a comprehensive plan for the correct
education and indoctrination of the racially purified nation. In order to
do so,
one needed to prove the early existence of such a race and create a
history for
it. While Himmler developed a cult for the Germanic race, music historians
in his
employment scrutinized relics for traces of prehistoric music practice,
medieval
sources for indications of "Germanic" influences among the various
versions of
Gregorian chant, and folk music for the simple elements of "ur-German
music,"
with the goal of bringing the essence of the Germanic race to life through
music.
Himmler's fabled interest in Gregorian chant was therefore part of a plan
to
demonstrate the long existence of a Germanic race through documentation,
unlike
the more speculative folk-music approach.
<sup><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>

<p>
The SS preoccupation with uncovering and reviving artifacts and rituals of
the
remote Germanic past can be regarded as a bizarre culmination of the
pervasive
sentiments of nostalgia and nationalism--both of which had corresponding
effects
on music practice and music scholarship, and both of which grew out of
romanticism and gained momentum after the turn of the century. Postwar
Germany
was especially consumed by concerns that created a longing for harmony,
national
unity, and for "simpler" times: the insecurity of living in a society that
had
been split into dozens of political and social factions, the degradation
and loss
of national pride following the military defeat, the fears of economic
distress,
the threat of poverty, and encroaching foreign capitalist interests.

<p>
Nostalgia and the glorification of folk culture, a central feature of
romanticism, overlapped with the drive toward German unification in 1871
and the
creation of a 

<B></B>

 concept of German nationhood. The
German Youth Movement then
arose
around 1900 in response to rapid industrialization of the late nineteenth
century, the depersonalized nature of urban-industrial society, and the
perceived
threat of socialism and the labor movements. Bourgeois youths took to
roaming the
countryside, conjuring up fantasies of Germany's medieval past, and
seeking
camaraderie through extracurricular cultural activities.
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
The
Youth
Music Movement, its musical counterpart, similarly rejected an existing
culture
dominated by individualism, "art for art's sake," the cult of genius, and
public
musical institutions that promoted these bourgeois ideals--concerts,
operas, and
the music profession in general. They searched for an "objective" music
that
could bond the entire "people's community" <I>(Volksgemeinschaft) </I>and
set out
to discover a "communal music culture" <I>(Gemeinschaftsmusikkultur)</I>
that
would exploit the "community-building power of music"
<I>(gemeinschaftsbildende
Kraft der Musik).</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>

<p>
Nostalgia and a desire for national unity spread beyond the Youth Music
Movement
into the growing amateur movement, politics, and the sentiments of
musicologists.
Scholars such as Sch&uuml;nemann, Gurlitt, Schrade, and
M&uuml;ller-Blattau, to
name a few, openly expressed their belief that music could smooth over
differences, that communal music making could heal the wounds dividing
German
society, and that music education was the means toward this
end.
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
Many agreed that the music of the nineteenth century had become too
subjective
and alienated from the <I>Volk,</I> and this alienation could be linked to
the
many ills of modern society, such as technology and
materialism.
<sup><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
The time had come for music once again to be in service to the
<I>Volk,</I> as it
had been in preindustrial times, and its return could be facilitated
through the
cultivation of folk music and the encouragement of amateur
participation.
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>

<p>
The draw to the past was fueled not only by musicologists' intensive
historical
training, but also by their utter confusion with regard to trends in music
of the
present. Even those who made a valiant attempt to come to terms with
modern
composition found themselves at a loss to comprehend it.
<sup><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
By
1933
musicologists seemed to lose interest in the burning issues of modern
music,
probably because, as the literature indicates, such burning issues had
simply
been extinguished. While Mersmann had once described Schoenberg's
alienation from
the public as "the burden of the prophet" and looked forward with
anticipation to
the creations of Haba and Krenek, by 1932 Moser was dismissing Schoenberg
and his
school as eccentric zealots whose time had passed.
<sup><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>

<p>
The cooperation between the SS and musicology transcended mutual
exploitation for
immediate practical gains. This cooperation was founded on a deeper
understanding
that grew out of the shared goals of the SS, the Nazi state, and the
guardians of
German <I>Kultur.</I> More than other scholars, however, German
musicologists
came to be regarded as the guardians of Germany's most prized legacy. In
1939, in
a commemorative volume for Hitler's fiftieth birthday, Friedrich Blume
described
his own field in the following terms: "German musicology has the task of
protecting one of the noblest commodities of German culture. Music has
always
been the most vital 

<B></B>

 and most characteristic
expression of the German
spirit. . .
. The heritage of German music dictates [musicology's]
commission."
<sup><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>

<p>
Music had long been regarded as the crowning achievement of the German
nation,
and musicologists had by this time become so firmly committed to
understanding
the history and practice of German music, and more recently to discovering
"untainted" manifestations in "primitive" folk music, that they could
conceivably
share in the state's belief that music was "the most German of the arts."
For the
Nazi state, the full rehabilitation of German identity, severely damaged
after
World War I, relied on the preservation of musical institutions as well as
constant reminders of the history of German musical superiority. For the
SS, the
establishment of a Germanic cult would similarly rely heavily on music as
the
purest expression of the Germanic soul and one of the most consistent
demonstrations of the strength of Germanic race in the face of
adversities. To
achieve these ends, the cooperation of musicologists was indispensable.

The Wagner cult was in a state of decline after 1926, and Hitler, a
long-time
admirer of Wagner and frequent guest at Bayreuth, became the chief
benefactor of
the Bayreuth Festival to keep it alive; see Hubert Kolland,

year,
Hitler purchased tens of thousands of marks worth of tickets, he
contributed RM
50,000 for each new production, and in 1940 he provided for half a million
marks
to keep the festival running; see Fred K. Prieburg, <I>Musik im
NS-Staat</I>
(Frankfurt: Fischer, 1982), 307. When Winifred wanted to suspend the
festival
when the war broke out, Hitler averted its closure by designating it a war
festival, opening it up to soldiers and thereby facilitating government
subsidies; see Michael Karbaum, <I>Studien zur Geschichte der Bayreuther
Festpiele (1876-1976)</I> (Regensburg: Bosse, 1976), 91-93. The Berlin

Fritz Ringer's compelling argument designates Weimar professors as
Germany's
degenerating "mandarin intellectuals," and describes them as a class that
achieved its high social position from educational achievements rather
than from
inherited land or acquired capital. They reached their peak during the
transition
between agrarian and industrial economies, at which time they dictated the
mission of the nation and state in terms of its intellectual and spiritual
life
and saw themselves as the spiritual nobility of the nation. This had
empowered
them to resist any interference from ruling parties and insist on the
preservation of the academic freedom and self-government granted to them.

The <I>Vernunftrepublikaner</I> (pragmatic Republicans) were a small

while the apolitical "silent majority" longed for the glorious days of the

the
Republic with the current overcrowded universities, a perceived decline in
scholarship, and the economic disaster of hyperinflation that accompanied

professor,
understood the problems inside the university and wanted only to modernize
the
oligarchy without dismantling it, but the majority of professors saw his
suggestions as the unacceptable mixing of scholarship with politics and a
reprehensible attempt at "democratizing" the university. One historian
argues
that Becker's suggestions never came close to undermining academic freedom

self-rule, but universities were so staunchly reactionary as to thwart
even those
measures that might have improved the functioning of the institution; see

According to Freidrich Blume, the older mathematical study of the
science of
music had died out in German universities by the eighteenth century, and a
new
approach evolved from the appointment of the university music director
into a
systematic training in musicianship in combination with music history.
Most of
the earliest musicologists either received their training in other
humanities
disciplines or in practical music, and most universities delayed accepting
musicology as an academic discipline. When musicology proved itself a
worthy
academic pursuit, a split developed between those who remained close to
music
practice and those who "locked themselves up in ivory towers." In Blume's
assessment, this ideological split in the academic community has
never been
resolved and the role of music in the German university has never been
clearly
defined. See Friedrich Blume, "Musicology in German Universities,"
<I>Current
Musicology</I> 9 : 52-64.

Around the turn of the century, Hermann Kretzschmar advocated that
musicology's first responsibility was to music and musicians, not other
sciences
(Hermann Kretzschmar, <I>Musikalische Zeitfragen</I> [Leipzig: C. F.
Peters,
1903], 79), and the pressures of the Weimar era caused musicologists to
give new
consideration to Kretzschmar's admonition. Most notably, Arnold Schering
criticized the growing gulf between contemporary musical scholarship and
composition, a product of musicology's tendency to bury itself in the
past; see
Arnold Schering, "Musikwissenschaft und Kunst der Gegenwart," <I>Bericht

The Socialist Party had sponsored recreational organizations as early

the choral groups of the workers' movement gradually became less

<I>Allgemeine Musikzeitung,</I> 11 June 1926, 527-8. Sch&uuml;nemann
declared the
need to encourage the revival of private music making not only because
this
activity had always been responsible for German musical superiority, but
also
because of its economic benefits for the music industry and the publishing
industry; see Georg Sch&uuml;nemann, "Die Lage der Hausmusik," <I>Die
Musik</I>
24 (May 1932): 561-4. Eugen Schmitz advocated that private music making
should
regain the prominence it once enjoyed, despite the difficulties since the
war
caused by the high prices of musical instruments and printed music. He
suggested
that cheaper instruments, such as the guitar and the clavichord, be mass
produced
to replace the more expensive lute and piano, and that the paper shortage
be
circumvented by state intervention, driving up the prices of "useless"
entertainment music and keeping the prices of art music at a minimum; see
Eugen
Schmitz, "Die Zukunft der Hausmusik," <I>Hochland</I> 17 (May 1920):
254-6.

Hermann Abert contended that World War I had contributed to the
awareness
that there was much to be done in the area of German music: "indeed, the
war has
confronted us with a whole series of new tasks, especially those of
national
character, and reminded us that a great deal of neglected work beckons in
our own
house, work that we had passed over in favor of international relations,
not
always to the advantage of our national music culture." (The original
reads: "ja
der Krieg hat uns auch auf diesem Gebiete vor eine ganze Reihe neuer
Aufgaben,
vor allem nationalen Charakters gestellt, und uns daran erinnert,
da&szlig; im
eigenen Hause noch sehr viel ungetane Arbeit harrt, an der wir fr&uuml;her
zugunsten internationaler Beziehungen und nicht immer zum Vorteil unserer
nationaler Musikkultur vor&uuml;bergegangen sind," in "Aufruf zur
Gr&uuml;ndung
der Deutschen Musikgesellschaft," 1 December 1917, Adolf Sandberger

in bad
economic times, one could always count on support from cities, counties,
and
communities; see Hans Engel, "Organisationsfragen der Musikwissenschaft,"

agency

"Musikkultur und Volksbildung," <I>Allgemeine Musikzeitung,</I> 9 June
1933,
309-10. In 1935, Siegfried Goslich opened a report by a student group with
a
quote from Hitler and the recognition that "the penetration of the entire
life of
our <I>Volk</I> with National Socialist ideology has awakened the feeling
of
obligation to come to terms with the new situation in the younger
generation of
musicologists." (The original reads: "Die Durchdringung unseres gesamten
Volkslebens mit der nationalsozialistischen Weltanschauung hat in der

Auseinandersetzung mit der neuen Gegebenheiten wachgerufen," in Siegfried
Goslich, "Studium und Beruf des jungen Musikwissenschaftlers," <I>Die
Musik</I>
27 [January 1935]: 283.) Fellerer came up with additional suggestions for
the
state to use the skills of musicologists, arguing that if musicology is to
be
bound to the <I>Volk,</I> it must apply itself to practical areas and not
leave
them open to dilettantes; see Karl Gustav Fellerer, "Praktische

The prohibition of certain Jewish and foreign works, combined with the
increased number of "German" musical establishments resulting from
military
expansion, had caused the supply of available repertoire to lag

rework old
compositions to render them more "appropriate." See Hans Joachim Moser,

concluded
that Schoenberg and his school had now found themselves in a dead end, and
their
chance to have a lasting impact on musical development had been lost to
more
promising younger contemporaries and the growth of amateur performance.
Krenek,
one of the up and coming, had matured from "cacophanist in the good graces
of
atonality" to show a "fortunate return to 'comprehensible' music." (The
original
reads: "Gewi&szlig; hat Krenek, in seinem 'Orpheus' noch Kakaphonist von
Atonalit&auml;tsgnaden, seit einigen Jahren einen erfreulichen R&uuml;cken
zur
'verst&auml;ndlichen' Musik angetreten . . . ," in Hans Joachim Moser,

1. Mediating the New Order
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
<I>Hitlerjunge Quex</I> (Hitler Youth Quex) is a legend for modern times,
a film
with a fatal attraction.
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
It sanctifies an adolescent's
heroic deed,
reshaping a young boy's dead body into an icon. It demonstrates a cinema
of clear
lines and straightforward answers, a medium charged with a mission: it
aims to
show the way. The film illustrates a political process and intimates a
master
narrative wherein human subjects become state objects and living beings
give way
to abstract patterns. <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> both heralds a new
order and
preres its subsequent self-destruction.
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
The first feature film substantially supported by the new government and
produced
under the protectorate of the Youth Leader of the German Reich, Baldur von
Schirach, <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> offers a stirring example of how the
National
Socialists employed a modern medium for state purposes, mobilizing a vast
technology to craft gripping narratives and promote popular legends.
Goebbels
well recognized the film's potential value as a political instrument when
he
became minister of popular enlightenment and propaganda in March
1933.
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Nonetheless, a comprehensive policy did not
immediately make
itself evident in the first declarations of the self-avowed "passionate
lover of
filmic art."
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Being in power did not mean controlling
culture; swift
legislation could not ensure overnight legitimation; any campaign of
coordination
<I>(Gleichschaltung)</I> would demand different strategies on different
fronts.

<p>
The National Socialists had become the masters of public life. Whether
they would
also become the masters of popular imagination remained to be
seen.
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The Minister entered the scene with a mixture of swagger and
circumspection,
proclaiming a desire to combat a spiritual crisis and "reform German film
from
the ground up" (<I>von der Wurzel) aus</I> so that it might convalesce and
grow
into a world power.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
In his early programmatic declarations,
Goebbels blends natural and martial metaphors, speaking of films as a body
and a
territorial surface, declaring himself the physician whose surgury will
purge an
afflicted organism of harmful alien elements. He scorns wishy-washy
entertainments without national character, clear contours, and a sense of
the
historical moment. A new cinema for a new Germany must rediscover the
innate laws
of the medium and realize its mission as a mover of masses. "It takes
imagination," he proclaimed, "to grant life to the innermost purpose and
innermost constitution of a new world."
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
Repeatedly, Goebbels stresses how film should exercise a discernible
effect
<I>(Wirkung)</I>, how it must act on hearts and minds. Its calling should
be that
of a popular art <I>(Volkskunst)</I>, an art that simultaneously serves
state
purposes and fulfills personal needs. The new film must free itself from
art-for-art's-sake dalliance, intellectual liberalism, and wanton
commercialism.
However makeshift and ambiguous his first proclamations might have seemed
(they
apparently made for some confusion), Goebbels attracted attention
by taking
dramatic leave of a previous era's attractions, pointing the way to a
popular,
contemporary, and distinctly national cinema.
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Film, he
proclaimed,
should emanate from political life and find its way to the deepest
recesses of
German soul and soil. Such a reform will take time as it will 

<B></B>

 demand energy and
sensitivity. It makes no sense to enforce an authoritarian dogmatism, to
"proselytize from morning till night."
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Political ideas must
assume
aesthetic force. That does not mean, however, simply reenacting parades
and
spectacles, photographing marching storm troopers and fetishizing
flags and
emblems. "Arousing the masses, that's something we know a thing or two
about,"
Goebbels boasted, in so doing setting aside a special place for film apart
from
mass rallies and overt agitation. Mere loyalty to the party would not
guarantee
aesthetic success. Authentic film art must transcend the everyday and
"intensify
life."
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> would do precisely that, intensifying life to the
point
of devivification. It focuses on a human subject and transforms him into a
political property. The film remakes and ultimately overcomes a boy's mind
and
body, rendering the material spiritual, transmuting being into form. This
process
involves the literal occupation of a destiny, its orchestrated
functionalization
by the mass media. Its subject was based on the life of Herbert Norkus, a
Hitler
Youth in the Berlin working-class district Beuselkietz, who had died at
the hands
of communist assailants while distributing leaflets during the election of
January 1932. Quickly enlisted as a Nazi martyr, Norkus became the subject
of
impassioned editorials and inspirational public addresses. Memorial
services for
the boy occasioned elaborate marches and demonstrations throughout
Germany. His
death received annual consecration on 24 January, a date of ritual
observance
during the Third Reich for all fallen Hitler Youths.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
These recognitions accompanied a wide range of popular renderings: novels,
plays,
poems, and songs.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Karl Aloys Schenzinger immortalized Norkus
in
<I>Der Hitlerjunge Quex</I>, a novel written between May and September
1932 and
prepublished in installments in the Nazi party organ, the
<I>V&ouml;lkischer
Beobachter</I>, prior to the book's release in December. The volume would
become
obligatory reading for Germany's youth, undergoing innumerable editions
and
registering sales of more than half a million copies by
1945.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Soon
after Schenzinger's novel appeared, Ufa, the most important studio of the
German
film industries, announced plans for a film version directed by Hans
Steinhoff
and produced by Karl Ritter, a project actively supported by the National
Socialist leadership.

<p>
The premiere took place in the Munich Ufa-Phoebus-Palast on 11 September
1933, a
festive event attended by party dignitaries (including Hitler,
G&ouml;ring, and
Hess) and accompanied by a gala performance of Anton Bruckner's Fourth
Symphony
by the eighty members of the Reich Symphony Orchestra.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
The
film
received the rating "artistically especially worthwhile," prompting words
of
praise from Goebbels, who wrote the prominent Ufa executive, Ernst Hugo
Correll:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> represents the first large-scale attempt to
depict
the ideas and world of National Socialism with the art of cinema, then one
must
say that this attempt, given the possibilities of modern technology, is a
full-fledged success.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Germany's greatest film company, proclaimed the
<I>Licht-Bild-B&uuml;hne</I> on
12 September, has mobilized "its extraordinary technical, material, and
artistic
means" to create "a lasting document of human and social circumstances, of
the
spiritual and 



 emotional impulses which brought
about the turn in Germany's
history."
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
The film likewise met with a degree of commercial
success, even if it did not match that of the more popular contemporaneous
Ufa
prodcutions directed by Gustav Ucicky, <I>Morgenrot </I>(Dawn) and
<I>Fl&uuml;chtlinge </I>(Fugitives). Having cost a modest RM 320,000 (an
amount
slightly above average for the time), it ran for fifteen days in the
massive
Ufa-Palast-am-Zoo, and by the end of January 1934 had attracted over a
million
viewers.
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Like the two other feature films screened in 1933 which portrayed party
martyrs,
<I>SA-Mann Brand</I> and <I>Hans Westmar</I>, <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I>
unfolds as
a family drama against the political and economic crisis of the late
Weimar
years.
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Heini V&ouml;lker, a printer's apprentice, joins a
communist
youth group at the prompting of his father, an unemployed worker and war
veteran,
a choleric drinker who torments his mournful wife. During a weekend outing
Heini
quickly grows disenchanted with his unruly comrades and flees their
alcoholic and
sexual revelry. Retreating into the woods, he spies a group of Hitler
Youths and
looks upon their nighttime ceremony with fascination, an interest
undiminished
even after the Nazis discover him and send him away. He returns to Berlin
effusing about their order and discipline, singing their anthem to his
mother,
and causing his father to scold and beat him. Despite this outburst
and the
promptings of the communist leader, Stoppel, Heini seeks out the young
Nazis
Fritz and Ulla. He refuses to participate in a communist raid on the new
Hitler
Youth dormitory, but cannot fully convince the Nazis of his good faith
until he
warns them that Stoppel and his group plan to bomb the new hostel. Mother
V&ouml;lker, confronted by an enraged Stoppel after the communist plot
backfires,
fears for her son, but does not know how to protect him. In desperation,
she
turns on the gas to put an end to both herself and the sleeping boy.

<p>
After awakening in a hospital, Heini finds himself surrounded by a
group of
Hitler Youths who express their gratitude and present him with a uniform
and a
mirror. As a result of his mother's death and his father's submission to
the
special plea of Hitler Youth Brigade Leader Cass, Heini moves into a Nazi
dormitory. Active and energetic (so much so that his alacrity gains
him the
nickname "Quex," i.e. quicksilver), Heini works all night to print
leaflets for
the upcoming election and insists on distributing them in his old
neighborhood,
Beuselkitz. Members of Stoppel's group, headed by the vicious Wilde, learn
of
Heini's presence and chase him through the streets, cornering him in a
fairground
where Wilde bludgeons him with the knife once coveted by Heini. When his
Nazi
cohorts reach him, it is too late. With his last breath Heini gestures
upward and
utters the words, "Our flag flutters before us, it leads . . . " as the
image
segues into a close-up of a party banner over which marching res
parade in
geometric conrations.

II. "Make Way, You Old Men!"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Herbert Norkus reappeared as Heini V&ouml;lker, a boy who overcomes his
own past
and the internationalism inherent in the name of his father: Heini
"V&ouml;lker"
becomes a 

<B></B>

 boy of the German "Volk," a hero who
responds to a
"v&ouml;lkisch"
calling and a historical mission.
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
He resembles spirited
comrades in
arms who, possessed by patriotic fervor, fell in droves during the first
months
of World War I, a shared martyrdom made explicit in a contemporary press
booklet:
"Hunted down by the commune and caught, he [Heini] dies the sacrificial
death of
German youth, just as an earlier generation died before him at Langemarck,
death
for the sake of the new fatherland."
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The film narrative
depicts how
Heini becomes a Hitler Youth, how human material ("V&ouml;lker") becomes
expediency incarnate ("Quex," i.e. mercury), a vehicle of transport and
tempo, a
political medium.
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Quex's last words strike up a triumphant
song and
give way to a rousing march, a symphonic conclusion and an invitation to a
dance
of death.
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
Nazi cinema initially took form as a site of transformation: art and
technology
were implemented to engineer emotion, to create a new man--and to recreate
woman
in the service of the new order and the new man. The different being
envisioned
here was an amalgam of vitalism and irrationality, a creature longing for
spiritual rebirth, for ecstatic life undaunted by cerebration. In some
respects,
<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> reaches back to expressionist scenarios, the
<I>Wandlungsdramen </I>(transformation dramas) of Ernst Toller, Georg
Kaiser, and
Ernst Barlach, plays in which angry sons rebel against tradition,
confronting and
even murdering their fathers, forsaking the bourgeois family in a search
for more
fulfilling communal ties. In both instances we find essentialized
emotions, the
pathos of what Gottfried Benn calls a "constructive mind."
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
"Facts,
things, feelings, and persons do not exist for it [the drama or film] in
their
own right, but only as parts in a working relationship to other parts.
Even as
content gives way to form, the concept of 'being' yields to the concept of
'functioning.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Similarly, the influential right-wing author
Ernst
J&uuml;nger valorized objectified human bodies. His new man relinquishes
existence as an individual, steeling blood and brains into the reified
technical
potential of the "type" <I>(Typus)</I>.
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I>
puts a hero into motion by inhabiting his person, dissolving his family,
and
arresting his life. Heini becomes a part of a larger whole and thereby
whole in
his existence as a part.
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
He functions as a role model for his
comrades in the film and for the many young Germans who watched this film.

<p>
Cinema assumed a key place within state institutions of discipline,
ring as a
mode of education, military training, and recreation. Film, claimed Nazi
Minister
of Education Bernhard Rust, speaking in 1934,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
is particularly important for our youngest citizens--the school children.
Film
must not only help them grasp contemporary political problems, it must
also
provide children knowledge about Germany's great past, and profound
understanding regarding the future development of the Third Reich. The
National
Socialist State definitely and deliberately makes film the transmitter of
its
ideology.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
National Socialism sought to organize the will of youth, to enlist it in a
historical mission. In challenging established authority, the party meant
to
usurp the place held by ineffective leaders of a moribund generation, in
effect
to proclaim, as 

<B></B>

 Gregor Strasser did in 1933,
"Make way, you old men!"
<I>(Macht
Platz, Ihr Alten!)</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
The Nazi party institutionalized
Oedipal
revolt, directing the young against "the parental home, church, school and
other
outdated forms and role models. In its youth organizations it assumed the
central
role in the rebellion of sons against their fathers."
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
Foregoing the Oedipal triangulation characteristic of the classical
narrative,
<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> begins as a family drama; by its end both parents
have
disappeared, the dead mother only briefly mourned,
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
the father
having surrendered his son to the brigade leader.
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The party
overcomes the family and bridges classes. Fritz and Ulla live in a
decidedly
bourgeois household, but their parents are nowhere to be seen and their
middle-class background in no way conflicts with their newfound political
identity. The party redefines family and social conrations, turning
itself
into the dominant focus of allegiance. (Elsewhere, the Nazi government may
have
paid lip service to the role of the family. Nonetheless, it
"simultaneously
deprived parents of the qualities on which a child's respect might have
been
founded" [<I>MFM</I>, 252-3]). The film's project, in short, was to
fabricate a
new political subject by redirecting identification.
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
It
provided a
cinematic bildungsroman which aimed to rebuild the youth of a
nation.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
A movement occupied an individual in the hope of
overcoming
masses, providing images of self-alienation so compelling that an entire
generation could, as Walter Benjamin writes, "experience its own
destruction as
an aesthetic pleasure of the first order."
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
Crucial to Heini's evolution is the acquisition of an ersatz ego, a sense
of self
derived not from parents but a party. Quex's new vocation also demands
that he
forsake sensual pleasure and sexual desire. Grundler, his roommate in the
Nazi
hostel, sings a popular tune about bawdy sailors, puffs on a cigarette,
and makes
suggestive comments about Ulla.
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
"You're one fine comrade"
<I>(Du
bist ja ein feiner Kamerad!)</I> retorts Heini, setting himself apart from
such
intemperance, aligning himself with the otherwise unsullied ranks
of Hitler
Youth. Grundler idly plays a song from an escapist film which was composed
by a
Jewish artist; Heini sings of a flag and a party. One will betray his
comrades;
the other will die for a cause. Aesthetic preferences, the film intimates,
mark
one's person and define one's very being.

<p>
The communists constitute, as Gregory Bateson has noted, a structured and
systematic counterpart to the Nazis. Communist dissolution and lack of
discipline
stand in direct opposition to Nazi containment and resolve.
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
While
Stoppel and his cohorts drink, gamble, and carry on, the Hitler Youth
stand
solemnly before a camp fire and honor the summer solstice. Heini ignores
the
sexual innuendoes of Gerda and--unlike Grundler--rejects her overtures.
Grundler
submits to physical temptation, shirking his duty and betraying the cause.
Heini,
at his most self-indulgent, enjoys a comradely kiss from Ulla and sips a
mug of
beer with Cass. Coming into his own, though, means steeling the body and
hardening the will, repulsing physical attachments and all-too-human
desires.

<p>
Heini is first drawn to the party when he witnesses a nocturnal spectacle.
He
experiences an immediate and intense fascination as he is swept up and
ultimately 

<B></B>

engulfed by this movement. Similarly, youngsters who partook of this film
found
themselves overcome by its audio-visual enticements. Bernhard K., ten
years old
when he first saw <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> in 1933, could vividly recall
the film
many decades later:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Communist youths were shown. All of them dressed like ruffians. Unsavoury
res. Then they set up camp and even girls were with them. Everything
was
really disgusting. The Hitler Youth on the other hand: all dressed the
same,
clean, nice, with leaders who had everything under control. I still
remember
today that after the film we all agreed: the Nazis made an altogether
great
impression, there was discipline, one wanted to join in. The communists,
on the

Just as Heini is overcome by the sights and sounds of a new order, so too
did
this filmic dramatization seek to overwhelm its young viewers, and to
shape them

III. The Fairground and the Forest
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
The opening sequence of <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> fixes on a street,
a space
governed by crime, chaos, and mass contagion, offering images well
known to
audiences of 1933. The shots portray an askew world where a youth's
attempt to
steal an apple and a shopkeeper's angry reaction ignite a political
spectacle:
debates among bystanders and expressions of outrage, the quick opportunism
of
communist rabble rousers, whose agitation causes a riot necessitating
police
intervention. The iconography here consciously evokes memories of
"Zille-films"
by Gerhard Lamprecht such as <I>Die Verrufenen</I> (Slums of Berlin, 1925)
and
<I>Die Unehelichen</I> (Children of No Importance, 1926), as well as
proletarian
dramas derived from Soviet models such as <I>Mutter Krausens Fahrt ins
Gl&uuml;ck</I> (Mother Krause's Trip to Happiness, 1929) and <I>Kuhle
Wampe</I>
.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
In fact, Steinhoff's direction seems quite insistent
about
its reliance on Weimar's cinematic legacy, borrowing as well from
<I>Berlin-Alexanderplatz</I> , <I>M</I> , and <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper</I> (The Threepenny Opera, 1931).

<p>
Hans Steinhoff's career as a filmmaker stretched back to the early 1920s;
he had
worked in numerous generic veins, gaining respect (if not inordinate
admiration)
for his technical precision, skillful handling of players, and careful
crafting
of dramatic materials.
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
(Cameraman Konstantin Irmin-Tschet
likewise
had worked on famous Ufa films directed by, among others, Fritz Lang,
Robert
Siodmak, and Wilhelm Thiele.) How, though, are we to understand the film's
blatant recourse to Weimar cinema? The National Socialists took a dim view
of
most <I>Systemzeit</I> (a Nazi epithet for the Weimar Republic) features
and
Goebbels firmly wanted to replace them with a new German film. Further,
both
Steinhoff and the production head Karl Ritter had unequivocal allegiance
to the
party.
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>

<p>
Previous accounts of <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> stress how it brings
together
conservative images and left-wing impulses, blending Hugenberg and
M&uuml;zenberg. The Ufa film 

<B></B>

 evokes the atmospheric
urban venues of Weimar
and
revisits working-class spaces: narrow apartments, smoky pubs, joyless
streets.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Carryovers also inhere at the level of theme,
motif, and
dramaturgy, be it an obsession with knives and a pursuit scene straight
out of
<I>M</I>, or the fairground barker and his ballad which recall <I>The
Threepenny
Opera</I>. Heini's family seems lifted out of films made by Phil
Jutzi, who
directed both <I>Mother Krause's Trip to Happiness</I> and
<I>Berlin-Alexanderplatz</I>. His father is a latter-day Franz Biberkopf,
an
individual castrated during the postwar era for whom class consciousness
offers
little succor;
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
his mother, like Mutter Krause, turns on the
gas to
take leave of her misery.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
These familiar elements allowed
audiences
convenient points of reference. Critics typically speak of an artistic
continuity
with Weimar film, coming to conclusions like that of Francis Courtade and
Pierre
Cadars: "If one puts all ideology aside, which surely is not easy, then
one must
say, that from a technical and aesthetic perspective <I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I> is
an outstanding film."
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
What people have tended to obscure in
their
catalogues of intertexts, however, is how most of these borrowings are
negatively
charged. <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> retreads memories in order to clear the
way. It
overcomes a past of inflation and despair and points to a hopeful future;
in
reckoning with Weimar film, it presages a new cinema. It recycles
proletarian
films by Jutzi, Brecht, and Dudow, remaking Herta Thiele's confident and
sensual
Anni of <I>Kuhle Wampe </I>into the de-eroticized Nazi <I>M&auml;del
</I>(girl)
Ulla. It also quotes from Lang and Pabst, at the same time pursuing a
strategy
meant to supersede and transcend Weimar cinema in the name of a different
film
art.
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
Central to the structure of <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> are two spaces
and the
fascination they contain for Heini, namely the fairground and the forest.
Going
back as far as <I>Der Cabinet des Dr. Caligari</I> (The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari,
1920) the fairground recurs throughout Weimar film as a privileged site of
agitation, spectacle, and desire, a realm of motion and excitement, a
protocinematic cult of distraction.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The carnival
ground--described
in Schenzinger's novel as "a truly fantastic world"--initially lures Heini
with
its attractions and games of chance (<I>DHQ</I>, 14). It is there that he
glimpses a knife with eight blades, an object of fixation which will
repeatedly
appear during the film. It is there that the communist Stoppel seeks to
win over
the boy and the vampish Gerda makes her rounds, whirling on the carousel
with
abandon and later seducing Grundler to betray his comrade. It is there
that Heini
will die under the knife he coveted. The fairground becomes a realm
of sex,
peril, and dissolution, a space that teems with uncontained potential and
unbridled appetite, a province of impermanence, randomness, and
intoxication. The
film presents the fairground as a locus of illicit sights and sounds,
leaving no
doubt that the communists are quite at home in this world of chance and
uncertainty.

<p>
The communists do not, however, control the fairground. They lack a
distinctive
will to form and fail to devise a spectacle of their own. Whether
partaking of
carnival attractions or mimicking Nazi gestures, the group attests to an
absence
of substance and identity.
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
When Stoppel and his cohorts go
to the
forest they recreate the fairground, transforming natural space into a
site of
card playing, sexual dalliance, 

<B></B>

 and rampant
consumption. Heini runs into
the
woods to abandon these amorphous masses and cluttered images, seeking
fresh air
and open spaces. Gradually, the commune's accordion gives way to brass
fanfares
and a song with a strident tempo and spirited lyrics. Curious, Heini
follows the
sound, stopping behind a bush to look down on neat rows of boys and girls
standing around a fire, listening to their leader hallow rising flames to
celebrate a better Germany. The natural setting and human ornament merge;
this is
a spectacle that rivets Heini's gaze, a ceremony with an impressive
composition,
a striking choreography, a binding power.
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
If the communists
contaminate nature, the Nazis contain it. The forest no longer appears as
an
extended fairground, but rather takes on the countenance of a training
camp.
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
It is not nature, but an extremely domesticated nature
that
overwhelms Heini, a mass shaped as a larger body, compact columns of human
potential, energy and purpose fueled by a mysterious force.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
When he
later seeks to recount his experience, the boy can only describe physical
activity and recite the words of a song about a flag and a movement.
Sights and
sounds, not argument and rhetoric, have won him over.

IV. Reach Out and Touch Someone
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art acquired a copy of <I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I>
from the <I>Reichsfilmarchiv. </I>During World War II, the prominent
ethnographer
Gregory Bateson undertook a close thematic reading of the film as part of
an
endeavor to comprehend National Socialism through its cinematic
self-depictions.
Bateson recognized that the lies of propaganda also contain distinct
truths, that
"this film, insofar as it is an integrated work of art . . . must tell us
about
the psychology of its makers, and tell us perhaps more than they intended
to
tell."
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Approaching the film with "the sort of analysis that
the
anthropologist applies to the mythology of a primitive or modern people,"
Bateson
pointed out how the film, in its systematic structuring of oppositions
between
the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, illustrates the
projective
workings of Nazi subjectivity. Communists appear as unbearable
self-images, what
Nazis think they "would be like without their discipline or--
psychologically
speaking--what they are like under the veneer of that discipline"
(<I>SCD</I>,
311). Sensitive to how the film carries out its ideological agenda
within a
narrative setting, Bateson comes a fair way towards understanding its
rhetorical
power. Aside from a few brief comments about lighting contrasts and visual
motifs, however, his thematic analysis has little to say about matters of
form.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
Most subsequent discussions of <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> speak of the film
as
overt propaganda, as a dramatization of "the struggle for the German soul
between
National Socialism and communism."
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Similar to the
contemporaneous
<I>SA-Mann Brand </I>and <I>Hans Westmar</I>, claims David Welch,
<I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I> embodies that "lie direct," that is, "film is exploited entirely
for
propaganda purposes; there are no subtle pretensions of mixing art with
politics"
(<I>NPP</I>, 48). Given what he considers a lack of refinement, Welch
finds no
need to address questions of representation or to distinguish between
propaganda
and ideology.
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
Nor is visual acumen necessary. The message 

<B></B>

 is
clear,
we need only listen: "From start to finish, the National Socialist
ideology is
loudly and unashamedly proclaimed" (<I>NPP</I>, 48).
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>

<p>
Welch's procedure resembles Anglo-American wartime responses to Nazi
propaganda.
Commentators spoke of it as primitive and unrefined, readily transparent
to
anyone graced with common sense. As Thomas Doherty demonstrates, American
wartime
audiences "were educated to the ideological power of mass communications,
flattered over their superior powers of apprehension, and assured of their
democratic immunity to the falsehoods of Axis enticements." Nazi
ideologues were
seen as clumsy and obvious, incapable of duping a more sophisticated
American
public. Hollywood productions of the 1940s represented German ploys as
risible
and flat-footed, assuming "a condescending and professorial tone when
addressing
its poor relations in mass communications. Look, the screen seemed to say,
see
how amateurish are the tricks, how easily exposed are the secrets,
of these
lesser media, so prone to manipulation and cheap effects." <I>Divide and
Conquer</I>, a Warner Brothers short of 1943, asserted that a con man of
the Nazi
media was no match for a movie- conscious American: "You are up to his
tricks.
You can see through his technique."
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
The brash strategy was
meant to
build public confidence; it surely had its justification in the context of
a
world war. In our present setting, however, such smugness becomes an
interpretive
disability that blinds the viewer to textual seductions.

<p>
Commentators repeatedly dwell on the confrontation between Brigade Leader
Cass
and Herr V&ouml;lker as the film's "key scene," a showdown where former
class
enemies "t for the young hero's mind."
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
These analyses
concentrate on the dialogue, dealing with the film as if it were a written
script. We read nothing about composition, blocking, gesture, about the
visual
surface of the text in question.
<sup><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
This "key scene" likewise
seems to
stand in isolation. We gain no precise sense of its place in a larger
narrative
structure. Here Nazi propaganda would seem to <I>speak</I>--I stress the
word--forthrightly and apodictically. As Klaus Theweleit reminds us,
though, we
dare not solely dwell on what fascist language "says"; we need to
comprehend how
it functions (<I>MFM</I>, 261). If anything, the scene in question and the
narrative as a whole rely more strongly on tactile rather than verbal
persuasion.
The film appeals to a feeling rather than a thinking spectator. If the
party
member prevails, it is not because of what he says, but how he speaks. And
what
convinces is the personal touch.

<p>
A closer look at the famous confrontation bears this out, a scene of nine
shots
lasting a little more than three minutes.
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
The convalescing
Heini,
dressed in pyjamas and bearing a cane, sits on a part bench (shot no.
322). We
cut to Herr V&ouml;lker and Cass walking towards him (shot no. 323),
moving to a
closer view of them as they approach the boy (shot no. 324). The two enter
the
frame to greet Heini in a complex shot that will take almost seventy-five
seconds
(shot no. 325). Initially, Heini stands to the right of his father and
Cass;
V&ouml;lker then moves aside as Heini shakes hands with the brigade
leader. The
youth's question, "Where am I to go?" <I>(Wo soll ich'n hin?)</I> in
essence
reiterates the compositional dilemma. The father, who has turned his back,
spins
around, insisting the boy belongs to him. <I>"That</I> is the question"
<I>(Das
eben ist die Frage!)</I> retorts Cass as the camera changes its position
to 

<B></B>

exclude the father from the frame, thereby anticipating the scene's final
outcome. Cass and Heini sit down on a bench. "Where does the boy belong
today?"
<I>(Wo geh&ouml;rt der Junge heute hin?)</I> the brigade leader asks,
going on to
effuse about the wanderlust of youth. "Boys are something wonderful!"
(Jungens
sind etwas wunder bares). he rejoices, with perceptible homoerotic
enthusiasm.
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
The camera lingers for a long while on a
close-up of
Cass's animated face, panning to capture Heini's transfixed response.
"Where does
the boy belong?" repeats Cass. We pan right from Heini to his father, who
peers
at his now offscreen son; the camera then dollies back to give us a
two-shot of
Herr V&ouml;lker and his son. Heini, though, is elsewhere, contemplating a
faraway world, coming to himself only when his father elbows him and bids
him to
speak.

<p>
After his initial question, Heini remains silent for the duration of the
scene,
positioned between the two adults as they square off in a physical
confrontation.
While Herr V&ouml;lker hunches down, his hands tightly gripping a hat
between his
legs, he articulates the body language of someone diminished and depleted,
paralyzed by the past (shot nos. 327-8). The camera cuts to a two-shot of
father
and progeny (shot no. 329), displaying wounded sons of Germany in need of
help.
The scene's climactic take (shot no. 330) will last forty-five seconds.
Reversing
angles, the camera cuts to a vantage point behind the bench, realigning
itself so
that the viewer experiences the showdown from Heini's perspective. Both
men stand
up during the face-off: Cass confident, hands in pocket, his voice
controlled;
V&ouml;lker huffy, limbs taut, expression grim. Cass belittles
V&ouml;lker's
communist allegiances, his comrades, the International. The brigade leader
asserts his superiority, commanding the frame, casting a shadow and
looking down
on V&ouml;lker, asking him where he was born, in what city, in what
country. His
face brightly contoured by the light, Cass repeats the ultimate answer as
an
irrevocable truth ("In Germany, that's right!"), his fingers moving back
and
forth between himself and his interlocutor: "In <I>our</I>
Germany!" <I>(In
Deutschland, jawohl! In unserem Deutschland!)</I> His hand reaches out and
repeatedly taps V&ouml;lker on the chest. "Think about that, why don't
you!"
<I>(Das &uuml;berlegen Sie sich mal!)</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
A hand reaches out and touches a listener. A compelling presence provides
a role
model for Heini, a better self-image for Herr V&ouml;lker, a point of
orientation
for the viewer. A subsequent scene, another prolonged take, bears out just
how
strong an impression Cass has made (shot no. 335). Speaking over beer with
Stoppel, V&ouml;lker repeats the brigade leader's catechism, but more
importantly, assumes Cass's compositional place and reenacts his
persuasive
performance. V&ouml;lker's gaze is now firm, his manner confident. He
confronts
an interlocutor with a challenge whose impact goes beyond words and logic,
whose
ultimate effect is that of a physical demonstration. He, like his son, has
been
won over and transformed, recast in the image of a new
Germany.
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
Stoppel also takes pause. Later we see him with a copy of the Social
Democratic
<I>Vorw&auml;rts</I>, suggesting at least a partial shift of political
allegiance. In the end, likewise, he warns Heini and sidetracks the boy's
pursuers.

<p>
We dare not underestimate the formal surfaces and visual strategies
of Nazi
films, even in the case of one of its most undeniably placative
productions.
Goebbels and 

<B></B>

 directors like Steinhoff understood
well the power of images,
how
they could stir imaginations and activate emotions. "The camera is the
star among
the film studio's equipment," cinematographer Konstantin Irmin-Tschet
would later
write, "it stands at that pinnacle of perfection which supports the art of
great
performers. . . . Being beautiful is not the thing, the point is being
clear!
Whoever sees clearly, sees most artistically!"
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
Karl Aloys
Schenzinger, likewise, recognized how visual impressions could offer clear
points
of orientation. In the novel <I>Der Hitlerjunge Quex</I>, Heini thumbs
through
the pages of a Nazi magazine, the <I>Illustrierter Beobachter,</I> coming
across
a photograph of a proud young boy standing at attention, underneath which
we read
the caption, "Germany's future." Immediately Heini makes the portrait a
part of
his own person, embracing "the boy deeply in his heart" <I>(den Jungen
tief in
sein Herz geschlossen; DHQ,</I> 160). Later, Heini reads an account of the
Tyrolean war of liberation (the backdrop used by Luis Trenker in his film
<I>Der
Rebell</I> [The Rebel], 1932), afterwards lying in bed and dreaming about
what he
has read: "There had been a moving story about a boy who had dragged
munitions
and water to the Tyrolean troops, until a French bullet laid him to rest.
Like
that boy in the story, he too saw the flag with the red eagle rising out
of the
darkness, he heard the noise of the rifles and the cries of the victors"
<I>(DHQ,</I> 207).
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<p>
What does <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> disclose about early Nazi film
aesthetics?
Goebbels sought to transform the film apparatus into a tool of the
state, a
medium of myth, legend, and fantasy which would relieve reality of its
dialectical complexity. The primary task when the National Socialists came
into
power was that of reshaping public imagination in accordance with its own
persuasions, of presenting an appealing and compelling worldview. At issue
here
was nothing less than the control over perceptual
possibility.
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
Among all of the media, film would from the start assume a privileged,
indeed
seminal role in the Third Reich. <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> bore out
essential
aspirations of Nazi fantasy production. First of all, film was enlisted to
simplify the world rather than to complicate it--in essence, to
dedialecticize
reality. In the early 1930s, this meant winning over cynical and weary
minds to a
cause by presenting a world of clear fronts and unimpeachable certainties.
"Reason as such," claimed a contemporary editorial entitled "National
Socialist
Film?" "has been divested of its cold power and has become what it should
be: the
technique of thinking with the heart." Second, the medium's proper calling
was
not only to simplify, but also to heighten experience, to provide an
emotional
frisson. "We demand of art," continued the editorial,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
that it genuinely move us and not just stupefy us with sensations; we
demand of
art that it probe the foundations of humanity and plumb its ultimate
depths; it
must show us the breathing of the soul and not, as has been the case for
so long,
just the pounding of the brain. We want to partake of the rhythmics of the
soul,
not just the monotonous uniform march of international
intellectuals.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
Goebbels's rhetoric and that of productions such as <I>Hitler Youth
Quex</I>
privileged the discourse of the immediate and the authentic. The new
German
cinema strived for a visceral appeal. In the process film was to become an
industrialized means of behavior modification.

<p>
National Socialism, despite its ideological pretensions of a coherent
worldview,
was to a great degree the function of stirring spectacles and pyrotechnic
demonstrations. Film provided the special effects with which the Third
Reich
created itself in its own image. In decisive ways, film and National
Socialism
would become of a piece. The flow of images and the movement of a party
afforded
nonstop excitement and ever-shifting perspectives. Each employed elaborate
choreographies and dramatic displays of emotion in the name of making
fictional
worlds become real. Both reached out to beholders, aiming to control their
undivided attention.

<p>
In <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I>, we witness the fabrication of a new man. This
new
man is no material being. The film tells the story of how a young boy
becomes a
political property. Inscribing an appeal to spectacle within a medium of
spectacle, <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> sought to bind a nation's youth to a
party's
cause. While claiming youth, the National Socialists also sought to
reclaim
cinema, realizing the power of both entities in their campaign to
transform the
German nation. <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> puts a party design into motion;
its
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne reshapes a scene and reforms a country, leaving
behind
Weimar tableaux of loitering and crime, progressing toward final images of
personal sacrifice and collective abandon. We open on a site of hunger and
confusion; we end with the ecstatic vision of a future order. With a
trajectory
that leads from a mob of agitated onlookers to a conration of spirited
participants, the film forsakes the agitprop of proletarian realism in the
name
of a classless society's transcendent power. It disdains the illicit
voyeurism
and sensual abandon of a decadent regime and privileges the fixed gaze and
erect
body of a new order, asking spectators to take the discursive leap from
Caligari
to Hitler, to transform the fairground into the parade
ground.
<sup><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
This
involves a shift of specular allegiance as well: distractions of flowing
skirts
and whirling carousels are exchanged for the intoxication of billowing
banners
and parallel lines.

<p>
<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> mediates the myth of a martyr in order to
mobilize
emotions. The dead Herbert Norkus becomes the raw material for the
fictional
Heini V&ouml;lker, who, brought back to life by a nameless amateur actor,
metamorphoses into <I>Hitler Youth Quex</I>, whose dying body in turn
segues into
a waving flag that becomes a screen for the sights and sounds of a
party.
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
Human substance evaporates into disembodied function;
a
corpse evanesces into a medium for a movement. The climactic moments of
<I>Hitler
Youth Quex</I> impress upon viewers a consonance between a waving flag and
filmic
flux.
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
Both provide attractions that bind spectators and
subjects:
to a movement, to a medium. The final sequence involves a celebration of
death in
which human sacrifice is experienced as aesthetic revery. "The flag means
more
than death" (Die Fahne ist mehr als der Tod) are the film's closing words.
This
film, likewise, is more than just a film, as its last shot of storm
troopers
marching offscreen into the battles of the future intimates. <I>Hitler
Youth
Quex</I> is not only an early 

<B></B>

 Nazi feature, but
also a remarkable preview
of
coming attractions, a <I>Bewegungsfilm </I>that shows the way to war and a
nation's collective self-destruction.
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
As Max Picard later
observed,
this new order would not lead to a new world. It "is a rupture rather than
the
real thing; this beginning is in fact the end: it is a world coming to its
real
end through its thousands of pseudostarts."
<sup><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
Surrendering
one's
person, participating in a great spectacle, and acting in a celluloid
fantasy
will become of a piece for Germany's marching minions.
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
<I>Hitler
Youth Quex</I> emanates from a cinematic apparatus that, in equal measure,
is to
be a dream machine and a death factory.

See Jay W. Baird, <I>To Die for Germany: Heroes in the Nazi
Pantheon</I>
(Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990), 119; hereafter abbreviated
<I>TDG.
</I>This source provides a meticulously researched account of Norkus's
life,
death, and transration. Throughout his book, Baird mimics National
Socialist
perspectives, simulating its virulant anti-Semitism, anticommunism, and
misogyny.
This discursive ploy is undoubtedly meant to be critical; at times,
though, it
gives way to an unwitting affective alignment. A description of the
character
Wilde, for instance, grossly embellishes what we see in Steinhoff's film:
"When
the devil took human form, he came as Wilde, and his followers are the
gangsters
and shadowy res who compose the neighborhood KPD. His physiognomy is
calculated to reflect an inner nature of decomposition; here, indeed,
was a
'subhuman,' the product of miscegenation, venereal disease, and
criminality.
Unshaven, squint eyed, and repulsive, he was the incarnation of
Bolshevism. The
gutter was his proper milieu" <I>(TDG, </I>123). The communist Gerda's
"raw
sexuality," we read, "is devoid of Nordic refinement"; a "painted street
girl,"
she provides "a walking catalogue of Berlin vice" <I>(TDG, </I>123).

Such a
call stresses historical exigency but in truth ignores the real forces of
history, appealing instead to "self-evident" claims of existence: "A
secularized
theological image of history emerges. Every folk receives its historical

existence" ("SAL," 35).

As the Hitler Youths stand around a piano and sing their anthem, we
glimpse a
helmet <I>(Stahlheim) </I>from World War I hanging on the wall. "The
future,"
claims Witte, "into which these choir boys want to march, as their song
announces
'man for man,' is their fathers' past" (Witte, "Der Apfel," 304). Compare
Walther
Gottfried Klucke's contemporary drama, <I>Einsiedel </I>, in which
the
ghosts of fallen front soldiers appear before a wounded veteran, now a
graveyard
attendant, ten years after Germany's defeat. Full of energy, they insist
their
deaths served a grand national cause--and that youth must carry on their
legacy.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT25" HREF="#REF25">25</a>.
In order to enhance the fictional impact of Quex, film officials
suppressed
the name of the Hitler Youth who played Heini V&ouml;lker. Thus, both in
its
story and in its production, the film depersonalized its leading player
for the
sake of a larger cause.

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT26" HREF="#REF26">26</a>.
Compare the expressive deathbed tableau in Karl Aloys Schenzinger's
novel:
"Heini sits up in bed with his eyes wide open. His gaze flickers, fixes on
no
one, peers into emptiness before it slowly fades out again. The nurse lays
the
sick boy down. His mouth opens. His comrades hear something, but they
can't
recognize the words. Then terror overcomes them. Heini is singing. They
stand
there paralyzed. They don't know the words, but they recognize the melody
that
oozes, chimes, and rattles in his throat. They sing it almost every day,
every
evening, on every march, on every outing. They've sung it with Quex, just
recently. It's terrible to hear him singing like this.

<p>
"The nurses bid them silent leave. They sneak away, upset, disturbed,
desperate.
They feel it. No one talks about it. Everyone knows: this is the song of
death."
(The original reads: "Mit aufgerissenen Augen sitzt Heini aufrecht im Bet.
Der
Blick flattert, sieht keinen an, sieht ins Lehre und schlie&szlig;t sich
langsam
wieder. Die Schwester legt den Kranken zur&uuml;ck. Sein Mund spricht.
Deutlich
h&ouml;ren es die Kameraden, aber es ist nichts, was man verstehen
k&ouml;nnte.
Dann aber packt sie das graue Entsetzen. Heini singt. Sie stehen wie
versteinert
da. Sie verstehen nicht die Worte, aber die Melodie kennen sie, die aus
diesem
Munde hervorsickert, r&ouml;hrt und r&ouml;chelt. Sie singen sie fast
t&auml;glich, auf jedem Abend, auf jedem Marsch, auf jeder Fahrt. Sie
haben sie
mit Quex zusammen gesungen, neulich noch. Es ist furchtbar, ihn so singen
zu
h&ouml;ren.

<p>
"Die Schewster winkt ihnen stumm zu. Sie schleichen sich weg,
ersch&uuml;ttert,
verst&ouml;rt, verzweifelt. Sie f&uuml;hlen es. Keiner spricht
davon. Jeder
wei&szlig; es: hier singt der Tod," in Karl Aloys Schenzinger, <I>Der

is to
represent the type: "For that reason one does not ask that he be unique,
but
rather obvious. One does not expect him to express the endless harmony of
a human
life, but rather its precise rhythm." (The original reads: "Daher verlangt
man
von ihm nicht Einmaligkeit, sondern Eindeutigkeit. Man erwartet nicht,
da&szlig;
er die unendliche Harmonie, sondern da&szlig; er den pr&auml;zisen
Rhythmus eines

"The priority and primacy of the whole over its 'members' (parts),"

No sooner has Frau V&ouml;lker died of gas inhalation than her son
dons a
Hitler Youth uniform. As Karsten Witte notes, Heini replaces his <I>Mutter
</I>(mother) with a <I>Mutze </I>(cap; "Der Apfel," 303). He reenters the
world
as the "true child of the drill-machine" spoken of by Klaus Theweleit, an
automaton "created without the help of a woman, parentless" (Klaus

In the novel, the father sends the police to look for his son who
disappears
following the mother's suicide. Apart from a short chat with Stoppel, the
father
vanishes from the film after his meeting with Cass. The lengthy plot
summary in
the Reichsfilmarchiv handbook of 1935-36 does not mention the father at
all.
Theweleit notes the general absence of fathers in the
<I>Freikorps</I>-literature: "Whether heroes or chief opponents, fathers
are
categorically denied a voice in these books. To a remarkable extent, they
are
simply dispensed with. . . . Patriarchy secures its dominance under
fascism in
the form of a 'filiarchy'--that much is clear. Nothing but sons as far as
the eye
can see--Hitler too is one of their number (Klaus Theweleit, <I>Male

the other's place; this process entails an actual change in the
identifying
person, inasmuch as the latter 'internalizes' characteristics of his
model"
(Wilhelm Reich, <I>The Mass Psychology of Fascism,</I> trans. Vincent R.
Carfagno
[New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1969], 46). Heini turns away
from his
father and Stoppel, finding in neither a desirable focus for his energies,
and
aligns himself with the party, an entity much larger than a single
individual. As
he says to Stoppel: "I believe in my F&uuml;hrer and my comrades, that's
why I'm
with them" <I>(Aber an meinen F&uuml;hrer glaub' ich und an meine

Oskar Mazerath, the young protagonist of another famous German tale of

Both an
antihero and an anti-Heini, he sits under a rostrum and laments, "Poor
<I>Hitler

mass
ornament and transforming a local Nazi demonstration into a swinging

Taylor, ed. and trans., <I>The Goebbels Diaries: 1939-1941 </I>(New York:

Threepenny Opera.</I> Typical Jewish humbug. This is the kind of thing
that they
were allowed to set before the German people with impunity. To our credit
that we

Steinhoff was sympathetic to the Nazi party before Hitler assumed power.
After
the success of <I>Quex, </I>the director became an important re in
youth film
activities, overseeing many 16mm short and medium-length political
productions
for the Hitlerjugend such as the highly recognized <I>Der Marsch zum
F&uuml;hrer
</I>(The March to the F&uuml;hrer, 1939).

Heinrich George, a former communist who became an important stage and
screen
luminary in Nazi Germany, played both roles. His onscreen change from red
to
brown thus paralleled his real-life transformation. Curt Riess (in his
inimitably
sensationalist manner) describes George's participation here as an act of
desperation and accommodation, an attempt to save his career and
reestablish
himself; see Curt Reiss, <I>Das gab's nur einmal: Die gro&szlig;e Zeit des
deutschen Films, </I>vol. 2 (Munich: Molden, 1977), 230-3. No matter what
George's motives might have been, it was important and useful to the Nazis
that a
prominent ex-communist publicly enacted his political conversion.

See Fuhrhammar and Isaksson, <I>Politics and Film,</I> 102. Jutzi, the
erstwhile proponent of a realistic film for working-class audiences, fell
into
obscurity during the Third Reich. In 1933 the Nazis censored his
documentary
<I>Um's t&auml;gliche Brot</I> (For our daily bread) and banned <I>Mother
Krause's Trip to Happiness.</I> His subsequent productions were limited to
short
features, generally comedies and detective films. Recently his entire
career has
come under reexamination; in late October 1993, the Historical Museum in
Berlin
presented a comprehensive work retrospective.

In the Nazi calendar, the summer solstice (21 June) served as an
occasion to
recruit new Hitler Youth members. See Klaus Vondung: "The summer solstice
celebrations lent themselves particularly well to ritual presentations,
where,
before a deeply symbolic fire and against a nocturnal nature backdrop, one
evoked
religious states of mind and feelings in the service of National Socialist
ideology." (The original reads: "Die Sonnwendfeiern waren besonders dazu
geeignet, rituelle Handlungen vorzunehmen und angesichts des
symboltr&auml;chtigen Feuers und vor der Kulisse der n&auml;chtlichen
Natur
religi&ouml;se Stimmungen und Gef&uuml;hle im Dienst der
nationalsozialistischen
Ideologie hervorzurufen," in Klaus Vondung, <I>Magie und Manipulation.
Ideologischer Kult und politische Religion des Nationalsozialismus</I>
[G&ouml;ttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1971], 81.) Compare the opening

See the compelling recollections of Peter Br&uuml;ckner, <I>Das
Abseits als
sicherer Ort: Kindheit und Jugend zwischen 1933 und 1945</I> (Berlin:
Wagenbach,
1982). Br&uuml;ckner describes his youth during the Third Reich and his
ongoing
attempts to find pockets of fresh air, spaces not controlled by the party
or the
state. He notes how Hitler Youth outings virtually occupied forests and
countrysides, "to be entered either as an exercise ground or as a site of
loud
games, and one could hardly withdraw from either." (The original reads:
"Das
Drau&szlig;en, von dem der lyrische Song ausging, war betretbar entweder
als
Exerzierplatz oder als Ort f&uuml;r laute Spiele, und beidem konnte man
sich kaum
entziehen," in Br&uuml;ckner, <I>Das Abseits,</I> 31.) For a scene
redolent of
Br&uuml;ckner's description, see Schenzinger, <I>Der Hitlerjunge Quex,</I>

As the government increasingly closed its net to ensure all youth joined
party
organizations, there was some level of resistance, especially after 1938.

The young actor who played Heini was reportedly the lover of Baldur von
Schirach. See the intriguing memoirs of a Hitler Youth member, Hans
Siemsen's
<I>Hitler Youth,</I> trans. Trever and Phyllis Blewitt (London: Drummond,
1940):
"There was a lot of talk . . . about Schirach's relations with a certain
boy with
whom he was seen about everywhere over a long period. Even at official
functions
this boy either stood next to him or was a member of his escort. . . . No
one,"
he concedes, "thought any the worse of Baldur von Schirach for loving this
boy.
We all loved him and quite understood how it was that the Reich Youth
Leader had
singled him out." For this reason, the verb "to quex" <I>(quexen)
</I>became
"part of the vocabulary of Hitler Youth. It is easy to imagine what it
means"
. Schirach was hardly the exception, maintains the author. "Among the
sixty
to seventy Hitler Youth Leaders with whom I came into close contact
practically
half were considered by us boys to be homosexuals." Siemsen describes a
popular
contemporary booklet, <I>Deutsches Jungvolk,</I> with "admirable
photographs of
boys, marching, camping, eating and bathing; and two full-size portraits
of two
particularly good-looking boys. It can be seen at once (I don't mean this
ironically) that the leaders who compiled the booklet are very susceptible
to
good looks in their boys" (Siemsen, <I>Hitler Youth,</I> 146).

<I>Hitler Youth Quex</I> would often be reprised during the Nazi Youth
Film
Hours from 1940 through 1942--and received with great enthusiasm (see Gerd
Albrecht's comments in <I>Der Spielfilm im Dritten Reich,</I> ed. Manfred
Dammeyer, 52). Alfred Weidenmann's <I>Junge Adler</I> (Young Eagles, 1944)
was
consciously intended as a continuation of <I>Quex, </I>a film for young
audiences
which built on the earlier success. A father gives his son over to the
Hitler
Youth after his own attempts at raising the child have failed. We see how
a youth
collective regulates itself, how boys educate other boys (much like the
Hollywood
film <I>Boys' Town,</I> 1938). The production in fact issued from
government
concern about how youths were becoming restive and out of control during
the war
years, reacting negatively to the hard work (e.g. ten-hour workdays,
graveyard
shifts), discipline, and sacrifice demanded of them, while being forbidden
to go
out at night, visit bars, smoke in public, or attend cinemas alone. The
working
title for <I>Young Eagles</I> was "Schritt ins Leben" (Path to life): here
again,
the film was meant to show the way. For an analysis of the film, see Rolf
Seubert, <I>"Junge Adler:</I> Retrospektive auf einem

<p>
Few res loom larger in the modern imagination than the
engineer.
Invoked as
the emblem of a dreamed-of immediate linkage between art and
life, as
embodying
the new norm to be followed by less technically grounded
practitioners of
thought
or art, and as an idealized agent of orderly
democratization, the engineer
hovers
at the center of the revolutionary fantasies of the
avant-garde. In the
famous
1923 pamphlet in which he identified the Bauhaus with the
will to erect the
"cathedral of socialism," Oskar Schlemmer called reason and
science the
"regents"
of the present era and the engineer "the sedate executor of
[their]
unlimited
possibilities."
<sup><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
His was that "idealism of activity that
embraces,
penetrates, and unites art, science, and technology, and
that influences
research, study, and work [so as to] construct the
'art-edifice' of Man,
which is
but an allegory of the cosmic system."
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Likewise in Le
Corbusier's
1920 program for a new architecture, engineering leads and
architecture
follows:
"The engineer's Aesthetic and Architecture are two things
that march
together and
follow one from the other: the one being now at its full
height, the other
in an
unhappy state."
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
He continues: "Working by calculation,
engineers
employ geometrical forms, satisfying our eyes by their
geometry and our
understanding by their mathematics; their work is on the
direct line of
good art"
<I>(PMA,</I> 59). Off the direct line of good art,
architects have instead
mired
themselves in ornamentation, the false beauty of secondary
forms. Their
present
task is thus to return to practical geometries: to "arrive
at the
'House-Machine,' the mass-production house, healthy (and

<B></B>

 morally so too)
and
beautiful in the same way that the working tools and
instruments which
accompany
our existence are beautiful" <I>(PMA,</I> 62)--to become, in
short, the
executors
of the unlimited possibilities opened up by modern
technology. As already
indicated, the modernist concept of engineering bears within
it rative
extensions into the domains of individual and collective
subject formation,
morality, spirituality, and even a utopic, human-centered
cosmology. Hence
for
the Left Front of the Arts (LEF), led by Osip Brik and
Vladimir Mayakovsky,
"constructivism must become the highest formalistic
engineering of all
life."
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Hence also for the self-designated man of steel,
Joseph
Stalin, the once "useless" writer was to become an (at least
rative)
engineer
working in the service of the supreme engineer, the builder
of the State:
"We
need engineers who build living quarters. We need engineers
who build
automobiles
and tractors. But we need engineers just as much who build
men's
souls."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
Many other instances could be cited, but the point would
remain much the
same.
The modern movement consecrated the engineer's
passage--carried out during
the
second half of the nineteenth century--from the periphery to
the center of
the
industrial world, from the status of a mere technician, the
passive
implementer
of visions of others (poets, politicians, generals, social
reformers) to
that of
socio-political visionary, at once creator and protagonist
of modern
times. This
event's impact has been well studied in the American,
German, French, and
Soviet
contexts, but less so in that of Italy, where even so
vigorous a proponent
of
industrial civilization as the Futurist movement clung to
what remains, at
base,
an individualized model of production resistant to
routinization and
rationalization. For all its celebration of modern machinery
and mechanized
humankind, Futurism rejects analytical reason and tends to
imagine all
manufacturing as artistic creation, the latter usually
understood as a
solitary
act carried out by the titanic individual of late
romanticism. It thus
thinks
mass production in terms not of the proletariat's genius as
marshaled by
and
embodied in the engineer, but instead in terms of a
"proletariat of
geniuses": a
proletariat of Prometheus-like heroes of the everyday life
world, each
endowed
with full autonomy. Cast in a similar mold, Italy's Fascist
decades have
often
been found wanting in the scientific-technical domain.
"Fascism," wrote
the great
physicist Emilio Segr&egrave;, "was substantially
indifferent to science,
which
it did not understand. It recognized a few of its applied
aspects and,
especially, its publicity value, but not the relations
between science and
technology."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
While probably true in Segr&egrave;'s own field,
statements of this sort underestimate the decisive role
performed if not by
"pure" scientists, then by technicians and engineers in
Italy's
conservative
revolution. Repeatedly dubbed by Mussolini "the category [of
workers] that
best
embodies the morality of fascist times" <I>(la categoria che
meglio
impersona la
moralit&agrave; del tempo fascista),</I> engineers were
often among the
truest
believers in the Fascist cause.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Most eagerly embraced the
regime's
ambitious program of public works projects and shared the
view of the
national
secretary of their union that "our engineers, because they
are in regular
contact
with the people, have the feeling that they have been
appointed
fiduciaries,
propagandists, and popularizers <I>(divulgatori)</I> of
Mussolini's word.
Ours is
less a technical role than a <I>practical political
role."</I>

This essay tells the story of one such practitioner. Not a
mainstream
practitioner, to be sure, but a symptomatic one who strove
to translate a
Fascist
politics into the language of modern technics in the domains
of
architecture,
theater design, animal husbandry, and transportation
systems. The engineer
in
question, Gaetano Ciocca (1882-1966), achieved considerable
renown during
the
1930s (<a href="2.3schnapp_1.html"> 1</a>). Author of <I>Giudizio
sul
bolscevismo,</I>
<I>Economia di
massa,</I> and <I>La strada guidata,</I> as well as of an
influential body
of
essays; close friend of Pietro Maria Bardi, Ernesto Rogers,
Valentino
Bompiani,
and of other prominent writers and architects; inventor of
the "fast house"
<I>(casa rapida)</I> and of the "guided street" <I>(strada
guidata),</I>
Ciocca
dedicated himself to building a new society through
technical innovation.
This
enterprise took him from the battlefields of World War I
through the
Fascist era
through the period of postwar reconstruction and, therefore,
raises
important
questions regarding the interconnections between Italy's
Fascist and
post-Fascist
eras. But his activities during the 1930s and 1940s form the
core of his
biography, for during those decades Ciocca emerged as a key
mediator
between
Fascist Italy and the countries that he considered the "two
most genuine
representatives of class capitalism": the Soviet Union and
the United
States.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
In his writings on these two countries, Ciocca
contributed
to defining the much vaunted "third way" to
industrialization that the
Fascist
regime claimed to have discovered. In his mass theater
projects, published
in
important reviews such as <I>Quadrante</I> and <I>Meridiano
di Roma,</I> he
responded to Mussolini's call for a theater of masses for
masses: a
theater much
like that which Ciocca had encountered in the Soviet Union,
but
Italianized and
Fascistized. In his architectural experiments he devised
new, industrially
produced peasant and worker housing units, rational in
design and entirely
prefabricated. In his ventures into animal husbandry, he
brought to the
agrarian
world the same enthusiasm for rationalization and
standardization that he
had
brought to the design of corporatist city plans, fast
houses, and 

<B></B>

 mass
theaters.
Finally, he labored tirelessly--and mostly in vain--to bring
about his most
ambitious dream: the construction of nationwide
transportation system of
self-steering vehicles on guided roadways; a system that
would reconcile
the need
for mass transit with private circulation, the collectivity
with the
individual.
Whether in this cluster of undertakings or in his important
contributions
to the
postwar reconstruction of northern Italy, Ciocca lived to
the fullest his
personal ideal (and, not incidentally, that espoused by
Fascism) of an
activist,
praxis-minded intellectualism summed up by the phrase that
provides the
title for
his first contribution to Bardi and Bontempelli's
<I>Quadrante:</I>
"Against
Sedentary Intelligence" <I>(Contro l'intelligenza
sedentaria).</I>

II. An Italian Engineer in the Land of Soviets
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
Ciocca completed his engineering degree at the University of
Turin in 1904
and
devoted his earliest years (1905-15) to working on steering
and suspension
components for railway cars. He served with great
distinction in World War
I,
participating in the battles of the Carso and Vittorio
Veneto, building
roads,
hospitals, barracks, anti-nerve-gas defenses, and radio
antennas, and
devising an
ingenious bridge-building method that he would later patent.
By his own
account,
the first shadowy glimmerings of what would later become the
guided street
entered his mind on these Alpine battlefields: battlefields
on which the
army's
recourse to fleets of individual trucks, each of which
required costly
refueling,
inspired fantasies about lengthy truck-trains pulled by a
single tractor
and
guided by rail-like structures.

<p>
Ciocca's transportation ideas came to slow fruition in the
course of the
interwar
decades. In the immediate postwar years, he developed
patents and worked
as an
engineer and consultant for the city of Milan on city
planning, public
housing,
and mass transit projects, and for his hometown of Garlasco
on several
drainage
and land reclamation projects. Ciocca's forays into these
and other areas
of
civic and mechanical engineering led to collaborative
ventures with Fiat
(the
Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino), and these, in turn, to
a contract
with
Fiat's RIV (Villar Perosa) division in June 1930 with the
twofold charge
"first,
of overseeing the design of our Moscow factory for the
production of ball
bearings and, second, of overseeing its construction and
start-up phase. .
. .
"
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
The responsibilities in question were very substantial,
given
Ciocca's relative inexperience in the domain of
manufacturing, and were to
have
entailed a three-year commitment. The RIV factory was to be
the world's
largest
production facility of its kind, larger than even its
Detroit counterparts
and
more thoroughgoing in its integrated approach to
ball-bearing manufacture.
It was
to be built, as was then standard Soviet (and Fascist)
practice, at
breakneck
speed, so that it could be featured as one of the crowning
achievements of
Stalin's first Five-Year Plan. Last but not least, it was a
key component
in
another five-year plan: that devised (and successfully
realized) by Fiat
to break
the virtual stranglehold enjoyed by American companies such
as Ford on
industrial
development projects with the Soviet Union. 

<B></B>

<p>
Stimulated by the Wall Street crash of 1929 and by the
apparent death
knell that
it sounded for economic liberalism, the early 1930s were a
period of
worldwide
fascination, fear, and expectation with regard to the Soviet
economy. And
nowhere
more so than in Fascist Italy, where Mussolini's regime was
putting into
place a
system that, by coupling workers and capitalists within
state-sponsored
corporate
units, each responsible for a given sector of the economy as
well as for
coordinating their policies at the national level, was
purported to offer a
"third way" to industrial development, combining the
advantages of Soviet
centralized planning with those of liberal decentralization.
"Moscow or
Rome?"
was the question of the day, at least in the minds of many
Fascist
intellectuals,
and in the words of one contemporary journalist, "among the
human
endeavors of
the present day, the Five-Year Plan is, at least in its
conception, the
most
intriguing and perhaps the most important."
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The regime's
special
interest in its Bolshevik enemy twin was, however, also of a
practical
order.
Italian exports were sagging as the Great Depression began
to deflate the
Italian
economy, so a series of measures were implemented to promote
exports,
particularly of capital goods, to new or underdeveloped
markets like the
Soviet
Union.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
In short, the stakes of Ciocca's charge were both
corporate
and national.

<p>
<a name="2" href="2.3schnapp_2.html">
<img align="left" hspace=5
src="thumb/2.3schnapp_2t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

Within days of Fiat's offer, an accelerated design process
was underway.
Fiat's
owner-founder, Giovanni Agnelli, demanded a state-of-the-art
production
facility,
and Ciocca delivered. And quickly so: "The overall project
that you asked
me to
devise in forty-eight hours has remained intact right to the
end," Ciocca
would
later brag, adding that "This overall design has redeemed
even
technological
weaknesses" (<a href="2.3schnapp_2.html"> 2</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
The weaknesses in question emerged as a
source of conflict several months later, when Ciocca
initiated his two-year
residency in Russia. They were not machine related, but
rather hinged upon
Ciocca's rigid insistence that "a clear sequential and
systematic
synthesis of
the [manufacturing] technologies in use" be developed <I>ex
novo</I> so as
to
allow for a full rationalization of the production line.
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
"This task
can be addressed only by an intellect that, accustomed to
bringing
clarity, is
unbiased by standard work habits" Ciocca would argue, making
a virtue of
his
inexperience: a position that bred dissent among his more
experienced
peers as
well 

<B></B>

 as among his Russian clients,
all of whom favored a less global, more
pragmatic approach.
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Aggravated by the Russians' tendency to
worry
less about efficiency than about meeting unrealistic
production deadlines,
the
rift grew to the point that, by July 1931, the Soviets were
demanding that
a
genuine specialist in manufacturing take charge of the
factory's start-up
phase.
A personal plea by Senator Agnelli (also in July 1931) was
unable to alter
their
view, so Ciocca soon found his contract restricted to the
construction
phase of
the factory.

However painful, the shift in duties proved congenial to
Ciocca, since it
freed
him up to introduce his two great passions--the development
of new
transportation
systems and of rationalized building techniques--into the
RIV project. In
subsequent months Ciocca carried out experiments with
prefabricated worker
housing in addition to his usual duties. Most of all, he
secured the
necessary
patents, ensured the collaboration of another Fiat engineer
(A. Piccin),
and
developed plans for the construction of the first <I>Autovia
Ciocca</I>
(Ciocca
roadway) in the Soviet Union. This futuristic system, later
known as the
"guided
street," proposed to place trucks and tractors on rails in
order to link up
Moscow's suburban factories and city center at reduced cost
and with
increased
efficiency (<a href="2.3schnapp_3.html"> 3</a>,
<a href="2.3schnapp_4.html"> 4</a>). Ciocca's ideas were in line
with contemporary
experiments being carried out in England, France, and

<B></B>

 Germany. His aim was
to
create an intermediate form of transportation between the
train and the
automobile. In Ciocca's own words:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The development of a new transport system is a matter of
some urgency.
Such a
system would have to be significantly cheaper than either
roadways or
railways.
It should be able to substitute either in most cases: in the
case of
trains,
furnishing heavy-duty, intensive, long-distance
transportation; in the
case of
automobiles and trucks, providing brief light-duty service
to isolated
locations.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The solution was to devise "not a motor vehicle suited to
railways, but
rather a
special roadway for automotive trains," a roadway that
allowed ordinary
trucks,
tractors, and trailers to circulate on inexpensive
reinforced concrete
tracks.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
An upraised inner wall was to have kept the truck and
trailer wheels aligned, with steering for heavy vehicles
provided by pairs
of
lateral rotors extending down beneath the vehicle's track
rods and pressing
against the inner wall of each track. Other technical
features of the
<I>Autovia</I> will be discussed in due course, but for
present purposes
it is
worth noting that Ciocca and Piccin's proposal was greeted
with anxiety by
Fiat
and with enthusiasm by the Soviets. The former wished to
dissociate itself
from
what it (correctly) viewed as an unproven technology and
proceeded to do
so by
forcing Ciocca to leave Fiat's employ. The latter appointed
Ciocca
director of an
experimental unit, funded by the state companies Ziat and
Zudotrans, whose
mission was to realize the guided street. Construction of a
twelve
kilometer wood
prototype that was to link up a railway station to two
quarries was
initiated
between May and September 1932 and seemed to have been
yielding mostly
satisfactory results. But from that moment on construction
ceased and
Ciocca was
forced to return to Italy.
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 

<B></B>

Despite the many conflicts, detours, and obstacles
encountered along the
way, the
RIV factory proved an outstanding success. Ground was broken
in the spring
of
1931. The lateral structures and outbuildings were up by
late October
(<a href="2.3schnapp_5.html"> 5</a>).
In early January 1932--the "allegorical date" established
long in advance
by the
Soviet authorities--the first ball bearing was duly
manufactured, even if
it had
little more than "scholastic value."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
And less than a year
after it
was begun, the complex, in the form of a vast single hall
surrounded by
outbuildings, was inaugurated. A stately ceremony was held
on 29 March
1932 that
included representatives of the Soviet government, the Red
Army, the
Communist
Party, youth organizations, the Italian ambassador, and the
world press. It
featured Ciocca as its keynote speaker. Our engineer had
received his
letter of
dismissal from Fiat only two hours before the ceremony, so
he was feeling
more
than a little disgruntled. But his commitment to the
<I>Autovia</I>
project kept
him eager to please his Russian hosts and to sing the
praises of Italian
discipline and technology. His speech, reported in the press
above a
subtitle
that read "The Americans Express Admiration," cast the
undertaking in a
distinctively Fascist mold. It celebrated the close
collaboration of
Italian and
Russian engineers, praised the accelerated pace of
construction, and
described
the factory as if it were a Mussolinian <I>bonifica</I>
(land reclamation
project): "One year ago, there were only swamps where now
there are worker
houses, tramway lines, and vocational schools."
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Ciocca
continued by
noting that the new facility's technology was unequaled
anywhere--surely a
barb
directed at the Ford Corporation, Fiat's American rival--and
that it
offered the
most modern solutions available in the domains of hygiene
and worker
safety. The
speech closed by noting the importance of training Soviet
engineers and
workers
to run the plant.

<p>
The triangular frame of reference implicit in the keynote
speech, based
upon the
study of convergences and divergences between Fascist Italy,
Communist
Russia,
and liberal-democratic North America, is indicative of the
way that Ciocca
viewed
his entire Soviet experience. Indeed, this very triangle
would shape the
two
books that established Ciocca's reputation as a writer and
cultural-political
mediator: <I>Giudizio sul Bolscevismo</I>  and
<I>Economia di
massa</I>
. The former's subtitle was <I>Com'&egrave; finito il
piano
quinquennale</I> (How the Five-Year Plan Came to Term) in
keeping with its
key
concerns: collectivization and the role of the state in
economic planning.
It
enjoyed such immediate popularity that it underwent six
printings between
August
1933 and February 1934. Beefed up as of the second edition
with prefaces by
<I>"Il Popolo d'Italia"</I> (Mussolini) and Pietro Maria
Bardi, Ciocca's
book
became the defining work of the "Russian journey" genre: a
genre whose
success
can be measured by the existence of similar travelogues by
Bardi, Corrado
Alvaro,
Mirko Ardemagni, and V. Beonio-Brocchieri, among others, and
by the
publication
in Italian of works such as Ren&eacute;
F&uuml;l&ouml;p-Miller's <I>The
Face of
Bolshevism</I>  and Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker's
<I>The Soviet
Five-Year
Plan</I>  and <I>The Menace of Red Commerce</I>
. As regards
Ciocca's
study of the new economy of masses (to be contrasted with
prior "economies
of
privilege"), limitations of 

<B></B>

 space
preclude my going into detail, but
suffice it
to say that the acclaim garnered by <I>Giudizio sul
bolscevismo</I> was
such that
the Italian Royal Academy decided to honor Ciocca with a
grant so that he
might
extend his study to the American continent. This he did in
the course of
1934 and
1935, and the result was not a travelogue--Ciocca had spent
barely four
months in
New York--but instead a theoretico-practical study of
industrialization and
economic rationalization in which the American case was
examined
critically and
comparatively.
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
Whether in the first or the second of these works, Ciocca's
fundamental
concern
was with the link between modernization and specific forms
of political
organization. He viewed modern industrial societies as mass
societies in
which
privileges once reserved for the few were increasingly being
extended to
the
many, but how to reconcile the drive to democratize
prosperity with the
pursuit
of a higher collective good? How to curb the activities of
socio-economic
agents
such as oligarchies, trusts, or an omnivorous state, which
would diminish
the
collective's prosperity by restricting its economic freedom?
Ciocca's
answer is
at once technical and ethical. It calls for "the courage of
dictatorship, a
heroic remedy to kindle the collective will by means of the
spark provided
by a
single will."
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
A dictatorship whose natural extension is the
corporate state:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The need for a newly ordered state, able to regulate
economic freedom and
to
engage in advance planning, arises in this manner. All
governments, from
free-market America to collectivist Russia, are cognizant of
this fact.
But in
both Russia and America we see the state limiting its
purview to the purely
material aspects of production, as if the individual were
entitled to
define his
economic needs yet were deemed incapable of satisfying them.
This is the
opposite
of the truth. . . . It is up to the State to create the
context in which
individuals operate and up to individuals to operate within
that context.
Individuals cannot encroach upon the sphere of action of the
state any
more than
the state can encroach upon the sphere of action of
individuals without
upending
the fundamental economic principle of the division of labor.
The solution
is thus
neither a <I>state of capitalists</I> nor <I>state
capitalism,</I> but
rather
state initiatives and private initiatives converging with
and completing
one
another. The first [state initiatives] create the
possibility for power;
the
second [private initiatives] transform this possibility into
a
reality.
<sup><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Moscow, New York, and Rome were for
Ciocca the three
laboratories in which the future of humankind was being
prepared. Hence the
"special interest for Italians" of his two case studies.
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
The
transition from a class-based economy, whether capitalistic
or
communistic, to a
fascist economy required an avoidance of predecessors'
errors. In the case
of the
Soviet Union, the lesson Ciocca gleaned was that, however
powerful a tool
is the
centralized planning of production according to national
needs, it cannot
right
the imbalances created by a state that has abolished all
private property
and,
therefore, all individual economic incentives, and in so
doing has
impoverished
the masses and subjected them to the whims of a bureaucratic
elite. In the
case
of America, the lesson was instead that the state's
abdication of any
central
planning role left the collectivity at the mercy of enormous
trusts
operating at
cross purposes with the national interest. The result was a
tyranny of
individuals akin to 

<B></B>

 the bureaucratic
tyranny exercised by the Soviet
government.
Proof of these failures could be found in the bread lines of
Depression-era
America and in the fully (under)employed and impoverished
Soviet work
force. But
the diverging symptoms concealed a common malady: "Russia
and America are
today
the two most genuine representatives of the <I>capitalism of
class</I>
that arose
in the course of the last century to replace the traditional
<I>capitalism
of
caste.</I> They have adopted the same program: to
excessively concentrate
and
mechanize production, thereby reducing all social and
economic questions to
matters of industrial accounting" <I>(GSB,</I> 25).
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
This
reduction
bespeaks a shared spiritual poverty:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Russia, on the one side, and the great plutocratic nations,
on the other,
follow
their respective courses on the basis of the same
materialist conception
of life.
They are both under the spell of the same miraculist mirage
<I>[illusione
miracolista]:</I> a mirage that promotes belief in the
prospect of
unlimited,
nearly inevitable progress along prosperity's open orbit. In
nature there
are no
orbits that don't come full circle, no rectilinear
trajectories, no
absolute
principles, no simple formulas for happiness. The force of
things bends all
trajectories and that which is launched towards infinity is
fated to come
tumbling down into the contentious circle of the real. [GSB,
55]

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Here and elsewhere in <I>Giudizio sul bolscevismo,</I>
Ciocca's intention
is to
differentiate the acritical worship of the machine
purportedly practiced by
Americans and Soviets from the "realistic" approach to
technology ushered
in by
fascism and adopted by practical politicians like himself.
For Ciocca
"realism"
implies a sober, practically grounded approach to technical
solutions that
views
modern technology and science not as ends in themselves, but
as means to a
higher
collective good. It demands a rejection of utopic
expectations regarding
technology and an intensive concern with addressing actual
social problems,
however intractable they may prove. It eagerly seeks out
mechanical,
utilitarian
or functionalist solutions to what ails humankind but,
keenly aware that
human
existence must always be defined by deprivation, work, and
struggle, and
that
nature's laws are irrevocable, it is immune to the
"miraculist mirage" and
wary
of the quick fix. Technological realism dictates moderation
so as to
insure that
the Fascist "third way" to modernity will escape the
pathological
consequences of
the first and second ways:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[Fascism] consists in cooperation inside the orbit of the
state among all
the
forces active within society, whether individual or
collective, whether of
the
body or of the mind. These are brought together in order to
insure that the
nation's productive energies achieve maximum results and
that the resulting
benefits are distributed in a manner that is both equitable
and in keeping
with a
collective good; a collective good that is less material
than it is moral
and
whose ultimate expression is the nation's spiritual grandeur
and power.

<p>
Ciocca's state steers a middle course between liberal
statelessness and
communist
statism, between hypertrophic individualism and hypertrophic
collectivism,
between the pursuit of material prosperity and of spiritual
grandeur. Its
moderate approach 

<B></B>

 yields increases in
efficiency inasmuch as the state is
strong
enough to gather within itself all productive forces, but
not so strong as
to
diminish their productivity. Like a supercharged engine, it
is able to
transform
this collective input into a maximum output that, optimally
redistributed
back
into the input stream, contributes in turn to sustaining
ever higher
outputs.
What it generates and, for that matter, feeds upon, is not
reducible to the
materials, statistics, and statistical persons favored by
industrial
accountants.
Rather, it is a volatile blend of body and spirit--a
<I>moral</I> capital,
identical to the spiritual totality that is the nation.

Some six months following Ciocca's return to Italy,
Mussolini addressed the
members of the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers
(SIAE) and
summoned them
to create a mass theater that would "arouse the great
collective passions,
be
infused with a sense of intense and deep humanity, and bring
to the stage
that
which truly counts in the life of the spirit and in human
affairs."
<sup><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
The crisis of the theater, <I>il Duce</I> averred, was
neither inevitable
nor
insuperable. Nor was it the result of the triumph of film as
a popular art
form
or of the masses' greater passion for athletic competitions.
Its resolution
demanded both "spiritual" and "material" answers:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The spiritual aspect concerns authors, the material aspect
the
availability of
seats. The time has come to prepare a theater of masses, a
theater able to
accommodate fifteen or twenty thousand [persons]. La Scala
was adequate
when, a
century ago, Milan's total population equaled 180,000
inhabitants. It is
not
today when the population has reached one million. The lack
of seats
creates the
need for high prices which drive the crowds away. But
theaters, which, in
my
view, possess greater educational efficacy than do cinemas,
must be
designed with
the people in mind, just as dramatic works must have the
breadth that the
people
demand.

<p>
Ciocca had not yet completed <I>Giudizio sul bolscevismo</I>
at the time of
Mussolini's speech (April 1933). An open letter to the daily
newspaper
<I>L'Ambrosiano</I> defending Bardi's Moscow dispatches
against
accusations of
filo-Sovietism had helped to earn him a place among the
founding
contributors to
Bardi and Bontempelli's <I>Quadrante.</I> Established in May
1933,
<I>Quadrante</I> managed for nearly three years to bring
together the
leading
advocates of a modernist interpretation of Fascist culture.
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
It was
an openly polemical, militant monthly whose articles covered
a wide
spectrum of
cultural-political topics, from architecture and urban
planning to
contemporary
literature, music, and dance. Along with its successor,
<I>Meridiano di
Roma</I>
(started in December 1936), it became the principal venue
for Ciocca's
contributions on theatrical, architectural, and economic
arguments, and was
largely responsible for his reputation as one of the most
inventive
technical
interpreters of the Fascist revolution.

<p>
Ciocca had no prior experience in the domain of theater
design. His Soviet
sojourn had coincided with the 1931 competition for the new
Palace of the
Soviets
in Moscow, a key component of which was a
fifteen-thousand-seat auditorium
for 

<B></B>

party functions. So Ciocca had occasion to view the losing
projects
submitted by
Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Hans Poelzig, Erich
Mendelsohn, and by Blum,
Lubetkin, and Sigalin, as well as the winning one by Boris
Jofan.
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
In addition, several passages in <I>Giudizio sul
Bolscevismo</I> confirm
Ciocca's
fascination with Soviet stadia, theaters, and cinemas, as,
for instance,
the
following:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Among the thousand Soviet contrasts, the most telling is
that between the
gloomy
monotony that oppresses the average citizen in his family
life and the
mirthful
excitement of collective events. In cinemas and theaters,
the audience,
always
unbelievably overflowing, constitutes a spectacle unto
itself. It
enraptures the
performers and is enraptured by them. [<I>GSB</I>, 167]

The strong impression made by the large size of Soviet
audiences and by
their
electrifying response to theatrical shows prompted Ciocca's
decision to
answer
Mussolini's April 1933 call. Between July 1933 and January
1935 he
published nine
major statements on this subject, as well as a range of
supplementary
newspaper
articles. These varied from brief synopses to full-scale
technical
proposals,
accompanied by technical drawings and by calculations
regarding sight
lines,
acoustics, and crowd flow (<a href="2.3schnapp_6.html"> 6</a>,
<a href="2.3schnapp_7.html"> 7</a>). All envisaged a
large-scale
covered
arena, similar to contemporary indoor stadia, built
according to strict
geometrical principles. The basic design consisted 

<B></B>

 in two intersecting
circles:
one large, marking the periphery of a concentrically
arranged seating area
comprising a floor area as well as balconies; one small and
centered on the
perimeter of the larger circle, functioning as a stage. The
theater's walls
(twenty-seven meters high) sloped downward into the hall,
such that the
diameter
of the floor was somewhat reduced (ninety-two meters) with
respect to its
upper
diameter (one hundred meters). A network of spiraling
corridors, wide
enough to
permit the passage of only one person at a time, ensured the
rapid but
disciplined inflow and outflow of spectators. (Scientific
crowd-flow
studies were
one of the era's passions.) Rejecting the window-box stages
of the prior
century,
Ciocca's theater employed a very large semicircular thrust
stage (forty
meters
wide) that reduced the orchestra pit to a bare minimum and
jutted out some
thirty
to thirty-two meters into the auditorium. It initially
assumed the form of
a
three-part stage, each of whose parts could slide along
parallel tracks
(into and
out of the auditorium), rotate (on or off the parallel
tracks), and be
lifted up
(for the initial preparation of sets on a second floor tech
studio).
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Subsequent designs increased its size and replaced
the
track system with a bipartite rotating platform. In either
case, Ciocca's
stage
was designed to both minimize and equalize the distance
between spectators
and
actors, to reinforce the sense of immediacy and even
intimacy (despite the
massive scale), and to underscore the life-like three
dimensionality of
the show
(<a href="2.3schnapp_8.html"> 8</a>). For too long, he argued,
theaters
have
flattened
reality out
into two
dimensions, "like a flower between the pages of a book"
("ITM,"
8).
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The mass theater would instead bring absolute reality to the
stage:
"Everything
appears, just as it should, in three dimensions: trees are
trees, houses
are
houses. The stage director need concern himself only with
arranging . . .
the
true images of things" ("ITM," 8).
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Like many other
proponents of
the Fascist mass theater, Ciocca assumes that the artful
arranging of "true
images of things" within the theater's compressed and
intensified reality
will
yield a spectacle form as hallucinatory as the cinema, yet
more seductive
and
complete, because anchored in the palpable reality of the
body.

The early 1930s were a period of enormous stadium-building
projects,
whether in
Italy or abroad. So Ciocca's studies not only found a
receptive audience
but
seemed 

<B></B>

 modest when compared to
proposals like Pier Luigi Nervi's for the
construction in Rome of a stadium for one hundred twenty
thousand
people.
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Their impact on public debates concerning the
"theater for
twenty thousand" was substantial, to judge by coverage in
the Italian,
French,
and even Japanese architectural press; and by the
seriousness with which
they
were discussed at the 1934 and 1935 Lictorial Games of
Culture and Art
<I>(Littoriali della Cultura e dell'Arte),</I> an
intellectual Olympics for
Fascist university students.
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Substantial enough, in any
event, to
determine Ciocca's inclusion in one of the major
international theater
conferences of the decade: the 1934 Volta Congress on the
theater.
Presided over
by Luigi Pirandello and sponsored by the Italian Royal
Academy, the Volta
Congress brought together men such as Edward Gordon Craig,
William Butler
Yeats,
Walter Gropius, Walter Unruh, Maurice Maeterlinck, Jacques
Copeau, Gerhardt
Hauptmann, and Alexander Tairoff for a five-day discussion
of the dramatic
theater's past, present, and future. The Italian delegation
included a
Futurist
contingent made up of Anton Giulio Bragaglia, Enrico
Prampolini, and
Filippo
Tommaso Marinetti; the critic Silvio d'Amico, and the writer
Bontempelli
(like
Marinetti and Pirandello, a member of the Royal Academy).
Ciocca's name
had not
red on the original list of invitees, a star-studded
cast that included
Federico Garcia Lorca, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Eugene O'Neill,
Karel Capek,
and Paul 

<B></B>

Claudel. It was added at Pirandello's insistence because of
the "great
competence" with which his publications had addressed the
topic for the
second
day: "Theater Architecture: Mass Theaters and Little
Theaters."
<sup><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Because both he and Gropius were assigned to the same panel,
Ciocca's Volta
Congress presentation followed directly upon that of the
Bauhaus's founder
(concerned with the Total Theater that he had designed for
Erwin
Piscator). It
bore the title "The Technique of the Mass Theater" <I>(La
tecnica del
teatro di
massa) </I>and examined the features that a facility with
the requisite
visibility, acoustics, capacity, economy of construction,
and ease of
entry and
exit, would have to possess. Illustrated by technical
diagrams and by a
large
wood model built especially for the occasion, it generated
one of the
Congress's
most animated and publicized debates: a debate in which
Ciocca and Gropius
found
themselves lumped together and praised for the audacity of
their technical
solutions but criticized for putting the horse before the
cart (<a href="2.3schnapp_9.html"> 9</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Why design such a facility, the critics objected, when no
repertory for the mass theater yet exists? Shouldn't
<I>authors </I>rather
than
<I>architects </I>take the lead?

<p>
Ciocca responded to his critics in essays published in
<I>Quadrante </I>and
<I>Corriere della Sera.</I> In revolutionary times, he
argued, questions of
precedence are irrelevant: "In the case of the theater . . .
the real
question is
what would occur if large cities had at their disposal an
auditorium
equipped for
every possible type of spectacle and capable of seating
twenty thousand
spectators."
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
Ciocca's answer brought him back to Mussolini's
original example: the Teatro della Scala in Milan. If La
Scala, he
reasoned, were
able to place its shows on a mass stage every weekend, it
would be able to
multiply its audience by a factor of ten and reduce its
ticket prices by
the same
factor, without any loss in income and without renouncing
its weekday
performance
schedule. Such an operation would not only democratize what
was once an
elite
cultural form, but also generate new revenues. All that it
required was the
elimination of all the inefficiencies of bourgeois theater
architecture,
so that
the same quality of spectacle enjoyed by La Scala's patrons
could be made
available to the maximum number of spectators at the lowest
possible cost.
Rationalization was the first step towards democratizing
elite culture. The
second step was to devise so flexible a theater architecture
that it could
be
adapted to every sort of show, from rallies to cinema to
dramas and
operas. The
final step was to foster the development of new mass
political/cultural
forms:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Above all else, the mass theater is a political, social, and
cultural
weapon of
the greatest efficacy. . . . It could host parades, great
corporate and
popular
assemblies for the diffusion of propaganda, films that
enlighten
culturally,
grand operatic and musical performances, eternal sources of
joy and of
spiritual
elation for the masses. And why not plays? I believe that
the greatest and
most
enduring dramatic works, from Sophocles to Shakespeare,
were destined for
the
masses. The matter has nothing to do with geometry, but let
me state that
I feel
certain that a glorious future awaits the Italian dramatic
theater.
Marinetti was
right when he expressed the wish that erotic plays and
thrillers be
banished from
the Italian stage. The mass theater will instead exalt
energy, struggle,
speed,
and progress. It will reawaken faith and arouse a new
corporatist
consciousness.
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
Despite their technical nature, Ciocca's
theater
writings do not shy away from defining the model of
spectacle required by
the new
corporatist consciousness. The model in question, instead of
relying upon
the
effects achieved by individual actors, demands mass
choreographies and
choruses
not unlike those employed in ancient Greek tragedy but
dedicated to the
celebration of Humanity triumphant (and not of Fate).
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
Parades lead
the list of its sources of inspiration, because they are the
"synthesis of
the
work of the collectivity, the glorification of the people's
labors, the
expression of the nation's passion" ("ITM," 10).
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
In parades
the
mass theater fulfills its highest calling. The mass audience
is invited to
gaze
upon itself, as if in a transring mirror: "While twenty
thousand
admiring and
applauding spectators cram the hall, thirty thousand others,
gathered
backstage
and under stairwells, file across the stage amidst bright
lights and
flashing
screens: a prize to men of good will, an incitement to tepid
souls, a
warning to
doubters" ("ITM," 10).
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
This narcissistic gaze promises
release into
pre-Oedipal bliss or threatens exclusion and eventually
punishment. It
structures
a theater within which there can be no gap between
auditorium and stage,
mass
audience and mass actor, or, for that matter, fantasy and
reality--a
theater that
is the allegory of a corporative nation that has little room
for waverers
or
doubters.

<p>
  Whether in his Volta Congress address or in his other
writings, Ciocca
identified his mass theater designs with architectural
rationalism (the
label
employed in Italy to denote the International Style):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
When geometry is applied to architecture, the latter assumes
the name of
rationalism. The Coliseum and the Roman acqueducts, to this
day the most
compelling instances of rationalist architecture, are
geometry pure and
simple.
The false rationalisms that sometimes afflict us are little
more than false
geometry, erroneous theorems, logical receptacles riddled
with holes. What
I
propose to do is to demonstrate how a strictly geometrical
method, based
on a
simple and clear set of norms, can resolve all the problems
entailed by the
construction of a mass theater. But to discover <I>a
method</I> is not to
discover <I>the method</I>. Better solutions will be found
tomorrow.
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Bardi, Terragni, Nervi, and others had long ago devised the
stratagem of
countering the antirationalist attacks of cultural moderates
(like Marcello
Piacentini) and conservatives (like Ugo Ojetti) by
emphasizing
rationalism's
Mediterranean roots, sometimes straining the limits of
credulity. But in
the
hands of an engineer, much of whose lifetime had been
devoted to designing
canals, sewage systems, and drainage projects, the praise of
Roman
acqueducts was
surely genuine.
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Evidence to this effect may be found in
Ciocca's
arena, whose circular contours suggest a tilted, streamlined
version of
Rome's
Coliseum. But it is important to note that, for Ciocca, the
connection was
founded on sound engineering and design principles (not
iconography). His
direct
sources of inspiration were the great assembly hall of Le
Corbusier's
Palace of
the Soviets and various Soviet theaters (among them that in
Kharkiv).
These he
freely expanded upon and modified, rejecting, for instance,
Le Corbusier's
recourse to microphones, in favor of the "natural"
projection of music 

<B></B>

 and
human
voices according to meticulous acoustical calculations.
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
True
to his
training, he devoted a great deal of effort to the
mathematical study of
audience
flows according to the principles of hydraulics in the
pursuit of "the
minimum
possible exit time from the theater."
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
Just as in the design
of the
RIV ball-bearing plant, Ciocca's goal was to devise a
modern, fully
integrated
facility, of the highest possible efficiency at the lowest
cost: "not the
cavern
of Cacus that are traditional theaters, but a spectacle
factory, clean,
orderly,
and luminous like a modern factory" ("ITM," 9).

In the months following the Volta Congress, Ciocca's theater
seemed on the
verge
of becoming a reality. On 10 January 1935 he wrote excitedly
to Bardi:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Now I have to tell you in all confidentiality that,
according to a reliable
source, an extremely wealthy Milanese industrialist appears
ready to
shoulder the
theater's costs. The same source claims that the Comune is
prepared to
cede the
needed land. . . . It appears, moreover, that it will be
necessary to put
this
industrialist in direct touch with the head of the
government, in order
that a
conversation with Mussolini provide the springboard.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Eight days later, a deal appeared imminent, even if its
shape had changed:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
I need Bontempelli's and your advice . . . on whether the
head of the
government
would approve the construction of a theater financed by a
small number of
major
Lombard industrialists. How can we find this out? It would
be best to have
a
face-to-face conversation, but who should speak to him?
Bontempelli, me or
you?

Another four months passed and, by his own account, Ciocca
was still
"receiving
requests [for offprints of his Volta address] by persons of
good will who
are
talking about its construction. Even the Japanese are
interested!"
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
A contemporaneous letter to Vittorio Mussolini, il Duce's
son, indicates
that his
sights were still set high: "Italy needs twenty theaters for
twenty
thousand: one
for every two million inhabitants: 400,000 seats in all."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
All this
came to naught. Of Mussolini's involvement in the
construction of Ciocca's
theater little is known, and even less so of Japanese
interest; neither
twenty,
nor ten, nor even one arena was ever built.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
The spectacle
factory
was fated to remain on its inventor's drawing board, despite
<I>Meridiano
di
Roma's </I>attempts in 1937 to relaunch the mass theater
movement and
Ciocca's
continued publications on theater architecture.
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>

<p>
If Ciocca
failed in his first great architectural enterprise, he
mostly succeeded in
his
second. This is perhaps attributable to the fact that his
active
involvement in
housing and urban planning issues stretched back into the
early 1920s. As
early
as July 1921, for instance, more than a year before the
March on Rome, he
had
drafted an ambitious study, entitled "For the Resolution of
the Building
Crisis,"
which 

<B></B>

 proposed a proto-corporatist
solution to the nation's housing woes:
the
creation of a public entity that would "summon not just
capitalists or
workers,
but workers and capitalists" to address jointly the grave
problems faced
in the
area of social housing.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
Many public works projects later, the
expertise he had developed in Milanese city planning issues
led to his
being
asked to join BBPR--the noted architectural firm of
Belgioioso, Banfi,
Peressutti, and Rogers--to assist in the design of a radical
new
"corporatist"
city plan for Pavia. (The plan was rejected, but Bardi
transformed it into
a
major cultural event by devoting an exhibition to it at his
influential
Galleria
del 

<B></B>

 Milione [<a
href="2.3schnapp_0.html"> 10</a>].)
But, however
great was Ciocca's devotion to
planning and
building the corporatist city, his deeper commitment was to
rural Italy
and, in
particular, to the agricultural world of his native
Lombardy.

<p>
<a name="1" href="2.3schnapp_1.html">
<img align="right"
src="thumb/2.3schnapp_1t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

These ruralist convictions came to a head in early 1935.
Prompted in part
by his
North American travels (which had included suburbs and
farming districts),
in
part by a desire to transplant the period's city-based
architectural
debates in
soil that was at once more familiar and politically fertile,
Ciocca
undertook
construction of a prototype rural house at Cascina Valbona,
a <I>bonifica
</I>located in the outskirts of Garlasco (<a
href="2.3schnapp_1.html">
11</a>).
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
This
model home
approached the question of rural housing in the integral,
totalitarian mode
demanded, Ciocca believed, by Fascist corporatism. "Half-way
solutions are
costly
and solve nothing," he would write, "they compromise the
full resolution of
problems."
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
His point of departure was, therefore, not
traditional
rural building types, but an entirely new kind of housing
specifically
designed
for Italy's peasantry: an attractive, modern, hygienic, and
extremely
inexpensive
house-machine developed with the same repertory of
techniques and
geometrical
tool kit employed in the RIV factory and mass theater
designs. The project
was
copiously documented, explained, and theorized in essays
published in
<I>Quadrante </I>under Ciocca's usual rubric of "Services to
Mussolini"
<I>(Servizi a Mussolini).</I> Bardi honored it with a series
of full-page
spreads, juxtaposing images of the clean modernist
machine-house with
decrepit
traditional peasant housing: a procedure he had followed
only in a few
prior
polemics. His tribute aroused jealousy within the circle of
architectural
contributors. But Bardi smelled victory: "rest assured," he
wrote to
Banfi, "if
we hit the jackpot on the rural house, all of
<I>Quadrante'</I>s
architects will
have plenty to do."
<sup><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
The hope was that the close fit between
the
regime's campaign to modernize Italian farming--Mussolini
had recently
spoken out
on matters of peasant housing--and Ciocca's practical-minded
project would
lead
to the latter's adoption on a national scale. If so,
Ciocca's rural house
might
become the means to a glorious end: the de facto adoption of
architectural
rationalism as the official corporatist style.

<p>
  The industrial mass production of housing had been one
the heroic
themes of
the modern movement in architecture, at least since Le
Corbusier's
<I>Towards a
New Architecture.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
But, with the lone exception of North
America, where prefabrication became well established soon
after the turn
of the
century, European architects approached it in a mostly
piecemeal fashion
until
the 1930s and 1940s. These years stand as the first golden
era of
prefabricated
building technologies and Ciocca's rural house is one of
this era's most
characteristic monuments. Its purpose was straightforward.
"If I succeed in
demonstrating that houses can be built with the same methods
that are used
for
building automobiles," he claimed, "I will have implicitly
demonstrated two
possibilities: that the benefits of mechanical progress can
be extended to
the
building sector and that homes can be perfected and
popularized just like
automobiles" ("SCR," 6).
<sup><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
In Ciocca's hands Le Corbusier's
"house as
machine for living" was to become a quite literal
house-machine,
improvable and
therefore expendable, and composed of 5,436 carefully
studied,
prefabricated
parts:

The 5,436 elements were reducible to an "alphabet" of
ninety-one precast
concrete
forms (<a href="2.3schnapp_2.html"> 12</a>). Their simplicity
of design
was
meant to
streamline the
assembly
process and reduce the time that it required:

As is well known, the greatest advantage of rational
building procedures
is the
time savings that they allow. Fantastic results have been
achieved in
automobile
manufacture; the same can be done in the manufacture of
housing. During the
construction of my model home, I timed various operations
and was able to
determine that many tasks that now take five minutes could
be reduced to a
single
minute; hour-long tasks can be reduced to a mere two
minutes. Planning and
organization are all that are needed. ["SCR," 18]

<p>
These economies of labor were redoubled by Ciocca's careful
selection of
autarchic building materials. In line with the Fascist
government's latest
directives regarding Italy's economic autonomy, he sought to
sharply
curtail the
use of iron, "a material whose use we must limit in every
possible way"
("SCR,"
17).
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
Hinges, closures, and locks for doors and cabinets were
simplified and standardized. Rebar or 

<B></B>

steel reinforcements for the roof
were
abandoned in favor of wood beams and a light metal netting.
Utilities--water
supply, water heater, heating and cooling systems, sewage
and drainwater
pipes,
stove pipe; sinks, shower, and toilets--all were
concentrated in a single
central
wall, the house's "spinal column," so as to rationalize
their layout and
reduce
the need for steel tubing. The air and water heating systems
were
integrated into
the cooking facilities; all drainage systems--for rainwater,
bathwater, and
sewage--were unified. Like most of the edifice, sinks were
made of precast
cement: a cheap and protean building material whose
production required the
expenditure of far less carbon energy than its rivals brick,
terra-cotta,
or
ceramics. In Ciocca's pursuit of economy no detail could be
spared: even
the
varnish for built-in closets, window frames, and fenestrated
doors--to be
derived, he suggested, from used motor oil "which costs
nothing and works
perfectly" ("SCR," 17).
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
The result was a total cost, or so he
claimed, of only 7,000 Lire versus 35,000 Lire for even an
"ugly and
inefficient"
("SCR," 18) traditional house.

The layout of Ciocca's house-machine prototype was spartan
and functional.
Consisting of two floors evenly divided by the central
utility wall, it
allowed
for five small rooms: three on the ground floor (a utility
room, a living
room, a
small bedroom); on the second floor, two bedrooms (one with
an oval
balcony) and
a bathroom. The two were joined by a spiral staircase that
doubled as a
stairway
to the roof (which was flat so as to permit the drying of
fruit and the
hanging
of laundry). The house's dimensions were extremely modest
(around seven
and a
half meters wide and six meters deep), but would grow in his
single and
twin
residence designs of the late 1930s (<a
href="2.3schnapp_3.html"> 13</a>).
Each abode
was to be
detached from
the landlord's house and surrounded by its own fruit and
vegetable garden,
so as
to grant a modicum of privacy. But each was envisaged as
part of a cluster
of
identical homes, homes that put on display the "aesthetic of
uniformity"
characteristic of the new corporative order.
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
Such clusters
form an
idealized double of the Fascist city:

I am certain that when our economy will be fully regulated
by corporatism
. . .
we will provide new peasant housing with light, air,
adequate space, shiny
flooring, hygienic kitchens, heating, ventilation, cold and
hot running
water,
showers, flush toilets, built-in closets, all without
exceeding the
current costs
for providing none of the above. And every grouping of rural
homes will be
granted radios, newspapers, books, and maybe automobiles,
and thus the
possibility of attending every Sunday . . . the purest, most
passionate,
and
imaginative of theaters: the theater of twenty thousand
peasants.

<p>
In Ciocca's rural utopia the mass theater occupies the place
once assigned
to the
church. Accessible to landlord and peasant alike thanks to
the
availability of
automobiles, it provides a place to worship a beneficent
state that aims to
extend bourgeois luxuries to the peasantry, but not to level
socio-economic
hierarchies. For all its collectivizing and standardizing
tendencies, the
corporative countryside is thus defined by a differentiated
approach to
planning.
To the popular classes it proposes a new aesthetics of
uniformity and
clustering;
to landlords, the same independence they have enjoyed over
the centuries,
but now
limited by the demand for corporate discipline and autarchic
restraint.

From the time that the Cascina Valbona prototype was built
through the war
years,
Ciocca worked on refining his designs. Certain of their
features had proved 

<B></B>

controversial: their use of flat roofs (ill-adapted to
Italy's northern
climes);
their deliberate ephemerality (being meant to be replaced
every forty
years);
their use of cloth partitions instead of inner doors; the
tendency of their
cement walls to sweat.
<sup><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
But even his critics were ready to
grant them
the status of "revolutionary."
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
Revolutionary or not, Ciocca
was
unable to persuade the ministries of agriculture, public
works, or the
colonies
to embark on the sort of massive building program he
envisaged (involving
the
construction of as many as one hundred thousand houses per
year). His
proposals
met a warmer reception in the private sector. Sample homes
or clusters of
homes
of various types were built in Vada, Ponte Ginori, Merano,
Garlasco, and
Condove,
for patrons such as the Solvay and Montedison corporations.
Encouraged by
this
success, he founded a corporation in 1938-39 for the mass
production and
marketing, both in Italy and abroad, of a variety of "Ciocca
Rapid-Built
Houses"
(Case Rapide Ciocca): single or double homes, one to two
stories in height,
buildable in as little as seven weeks time (<a
href="2.3schnapp_4.html">
14</a>).
Limited success was
again
achieved, but any hopes for a transition to large-scale
development were
undercut
by the outbreak of war.

<p>
Ciocca's integral solution to the problem of peasant housing
was, of
course,
integral only in part. Small clusters of rapid built houses,
no matter how
effective they might be in bringing dignity to a
disenfranchised
peasantry, did
little to rationalize Italian farming practices. This
realization prompted
Ciocca, during the very years of his housing experiments
(1935-42), to
undertake
a parallel set of experiments. From an operating base on the
Capanella
farm,
owned by the mayor of his native Garlasco, he set out to
reengineer
traditional
Italian farming. In the course of these labors he devised
and patented
several
inventions, among which a mechanical assembly that spun and
compressed hay
with
such force as to produce airtight cylinders that could be
stored in silos
for
extended periods. His principal passion, however, was for
animal husbandry:
initially involving geese, and later pigs. As Carlo Belli
would recall
many years
later:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
[Ciocca] finally succeeded in realizing his dream: a Grand
Hotel for pigs.
He had
fought long and hard for the idea, firing off studies to
Mussolini that
violently
denounced the vendors of pork for trafficking in
contaminated meat. Why so?
Because instead of being nourished rationally, swine were
fed everything,
at all
times, indiscriminately. Today's pig, he used to say, is a
building by
Piacentini; we must transform him into a building by Le
Corbusier. To this
end he
had built pristine and airy spaces, tidily furnished little
rooms. They
had a
straw bed, a toilet, and a special feeding trough that
permitted a . . .
stream
of food to advance <I>only up to certain point.</I> Then,
bam! A little
door
would shut so as to limit the pig's intake of food. (The
food was always
nourishing, clean, and in modest proportions.) Then there
was a small tub.
The
pig could hold down a small disk with his hoof and water
would spout as
long as
he kept pressing. The result was an absence of muck, filth,
etc. Ciocca
even
succeeded in training his pigs to shit and piss in the
toilet. . . . Right
after
eating and drinking, he would drive them towards the toilet
with a whip.
After a
few days the pigs would go without any prodding. In this
manner he achieved
unbelievable results: impeccable, bacteriologically pure
meat; swine that
instead
of being weighed down with unhealthy fat, were lean and
elegant in
appearance. 

<B></B>

 . . . But the project was discontinued
because
the swine
raised at the Grand
Hotel
weighed no more than sixty kilos, while those that been
raised on swill
weighed
well over a hundred.

Belli's portrait is accurate. In pig farming Ciocca found an
ideal
extension of
his housing work. If in the rural house one of his key
objectives had been
to
end, once and for all, the cohabitation of humans and
animals, then why
not also
rationalize animals' abodes? Why not create a porcine
"machine for living"
that
would also contribute to the well-being both of the peasants
involved in
pig
farming and of the consumers of pork? Such indeed were
Ciocca's goals as,
in
addition to devising Rationalist stalls, he carefully
analyzed every phase
of the
pig's life (<a href="2.3schnapp_5.html"> 15</a>). He developed
an annual
tracking system
for individual
porkers, which registered their girth and weight in relation
to their
dietary
intake.
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
He experimented constantly with new combinations of
foods,
"always nourishing, clean, and in modest proportions." And,
although he
never
published on the subject, he was surely aware of the
symbolic reversal
that he
was attempting to effect. Ever since Book Two of Plato's
<I>Republic,
</I>in
which Socrates had contrasted his ideal republic with a
"city of pigs"--a
city of
day laborers and wage earners, dedicated alone to the
pursuit of base
carnal
appetites--Western societies have identified the pig with
abject filth,
sloth,
and excreta; with dangerous, undisciplined 

<B></B>

 muck--the muck of the
proletariat.
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
Through the alchemy of Rationalism, Ciocca
wished to
turn rative shit--whether proletarian, peasant, or
porcine--into
corporatist
gold.

During the years of his building projects, Ciocca's greatest
dream--notwithstanding Belli's statement to the
contrary--was <I>not </I>a
Grand
Hotel for pigs. It remained the construction of a
transportation system
that
would "eliminate the antagonism between the railway and the
pneumatic tire"
(<I>LSG,</I> 245).
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
In his 1939 volume dedicated to the
topic, he
would write, with characteristic fervor:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Today railways are in decline, but the perfection that they
have achieved
is such
that to replace them with a new system will be difficult and
will entail
tough
experiments, attempts, studies, and sacrifices. This said,
it is high time
that
we set out to confront and overcome every obstacle and forge
ahead
fearlessly,
because the problem of coordinating ground transportation by
introducing
something new and conciliatory between two entrenched
antagonists, the
roadway
and the railway, cries out for immediate attention. I have
written that the
nation that finds a solution to this dilemma will be
rewarded with the
sort of
economic hegemony that England enjoyed during the nineteenth
century,
thanks to
its belief in Stephenson and steamships. [<I>LSG,</I> 46]

The task of locating a nation-state courageous enough to
"forge ahead
fearlessly"
would prove daunting. First imagined on the Austrian front,
proposed to the
Italian ministry of war in December 1922, proposed anew to
Fiat in 1928,
nearly
realized in the Soviet Union in 1932, the path leading to
the construction
of the
guided street had already been a long one for Ciocca. And a
long one it
would
remain. The major stepping stones may be resumed as follows.
Between
October and
December 1935, a small circular track (eighty-five meters in
length) was
finally
built in Pavia at the expense of the ministry of war, and
was tested out
with a
truck, modified as per Ciocca's 1922 designs. The experiment
yielded mixed
results, leaving a ministerial commission unpersuaded
regarding the
system's
feasibility as a permanent substitute for roadways and
railways, but
impressed
with its potential as a provisional system for traversing
marshlands like
those
found in Ethiopia. So off went Ciocca (and voluntarily so)
to the
Ethiopian front
in February 1936. For the next ten months he served as chief
military
engineer in
Special Division S, adapting guided street principles to the
division's
transportation needs as it attempted to conquer remote
regions still under
rebel
control. His success was such that, after months of
wrangling in the wake
of his
return, three ministries--the ministries of war, the
colonies, and
communications--agreed to contribute one million Lire each
towards the
construction of a full-scale line, so long as Ciocca could
provide them
with
accurate budget res. This required, in turn, the
construction of a
full-scale
prototype, for which purpose he was able to secure the
sponsorship of an
interested party ("interested" because the guided street

<B></B>

 was to be built of
reinforced concrete): the Italian Federation of Cement
Manufacturers
(Federazione
degli Industriali del Cemento). An advanced prototype was
duly built at the
Federation head's estate of Casal Fogaccia, in the outskirts
of Rome, in
mid-1938, and included bridges, turns, level crossings, and
six-trailer
truck
trains (<a href="2.3schnapp_6.html"> 16</a>). Its performance
was deemed
highly
promising and was
documented
by contemporary newsreels in Italy and abroad, as were site
visits by
members of
the royal family (King Victor Emanuel, the Crown Prince) and
the Academy.

<p>
A momentary high point was attained with Mussolini's visit
to Casal
Fogaccia on
11 November 1938 (<a href="2.3schnapp_7.html"> 17</a>). Already
an admirer
of Ciocca, as
attested to
by his
glowing review of <I>Giudizio sul bolscevismo</I> (reprinted
as a preface
to the
book's second edition), <I>il Duce</I> left Casal Fogaccia a
convert.
"This is
not a <I>roadway" </I>he affirmed approvingly, with military
applications
in
mind, "but rather a <I>railway."</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
He promptly ordered
that the
ministry of public works consider the substitution of
railways with guided
streets in Italian East Africa and that a first line be
built in Sicily.
Two
months later little had budged. So in early January 1939,
Ciocca requested
and
received a private audience, described in the following
letter to Count
Fogaccia:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
He [Mussolini] was visibly irritated at the lack of action
and, after a
probing
conversation . . . he asked if I had a plan. I told him that
my plan was
to found
a company, with capital from the IRI [Istituto per la
Ricostruzione
Industriale]
as well as 

<B></B>

 from private sources, that
would build and administer guided
roadways.
He then queried me on which ministry would be best equipped
to undertake
such a
project. I responded, naturally, "the ministry of
communications." Without
further ado <I>il Duce</I> phoned Minister Benni [minister
of
communications] to
request a meeting with Commander Menichella of the IRI to be
held the next
morning.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<a name="8" href="2.3schnapp_8.html">
<img align="right"
src="thumb/2.3schnapp_8t.gif"
alt="IMAGE LINK"></a>

The meeting took place and, in spite of Mussolini's
pressure, revealed
little
interest on Benni's part in construction of a guided roadway
between
Diredaua and
Harar (Ethiopia). Menichella, on the other hand, seemed well
disposed and
proposed the substitution of the IRI-owned railway line
between Siracusa
and
Ragusa because "work could begin right away." Needless to
say, it did not.
A
March 1939 meeting with IRI technicians led to a shift in
lines, this time
from
Siracusa-Ragusa to Palermo-Monreale-Camporeale. Other
meetings followed,
but
ominous signs began to trickle in over subsequent months. In
late July,
the page
proofs of Ciocca's <I>La strada guidata</I> were returned to
his editor,
Valentino Bompiani, without deletions, but accompanied by
the statement
"the
ministry of communications expresses its reservations
regarding the
theories
developed in this volume."
<sup><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
Technical objections on the part
of the
National Council of Scientific Research (CNR) and the IRI
were soon to
follow. In
September and November 1939, panels of engineers
representing both
entities'
interest in the guided street project raised concerns about

<B></B>

 the resistance
of the
roadway's central cement railing, about the durability and
cost of
pneumatic
tires, about the availability of sufficiently light yet
powerful tractors,
about
the impact of weather and debris on a guided roadway, and
about its
adaptability
to African conditions.
<sup><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
By year's end the project was dead in
the
water. Ciocca persisted, designing a propeller-driven guided
street model
for the
<I>Mostra delle Invenzioni </I>(Exhibit of Inventions) held
in Milan in
the fall
of 1939 and continuing to seek out Mussolini's support
(<a href="2.3schnapp_8.html"> 18</a>). Thwarted
in
Italy, he avidly pursued patrons in Argentina, Iran, Italian
Albania, and
especially Nazi Germany, sending copies of <I>La strada
guidata</I> to
Field
Marshall Rommel and several other German military officials.
Two decades
later
Ciocca was still pursuing possible clients in Tunisia and
Brazil, and
securing
patents for his designs. The lone satisfaction that the
guided street
procured
him came in 1959 when the Milanese public transit
authorities adopted a
subway
system much like he envisaged. Despite its bearing the same
name (and
despite
some early consulting imput from Ciocca himself), all
references to the
creator
of the guided street were ommitted in the public
presentation of a
prototype car.
A dispute over patent infringements erupted that would drag
on almost until
Ciocca's death in 1966. 

<B></B>

<p>
The saga just recounted helps to explain why, as early as
1939, Ciocca
felt that
the "guided street has proved an odyssey for me, not across
the sirens'
azure
seas, but through offices and antechambers, and amidst reefs
of private
interests" <I>(LSG,</I> vii).
<sup><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
But the question remains: why
embark
on such an arduous journey? (A journey often undertaken at
considerable
personal
cost.) For Ciocca, the answer was less personal ambition
than
<I>faith</I>--a
faith that, with perhaps disquieting ease, was able to find
a home both
under
Fascism and under democracy:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
When Stephenson built the first slow, weak, and imperfect
locomotive, he
could
never have imagined either the subsequent improvements or
the benefits
that it
would bring humanity. His confidence in the future of
railways derived
from faith
and not from practical details. As a matter of fact, faith
is the
conviction of
things unseen and, as of yet, impractical, even if they
remain certain. All
progress arises not out of cold calculations, but out of
faith in the
future of
humanity. [<I>LSG,</I> 44-5]
<sup><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The passage is revealing and applies equally to all of
Ciocca's technical
undertakings, whether before or after the war. Its
definition of faith
merges a
nineteenth-century credo of perpetual technical progress
with Catholic
eschatology. <I>Est autem fides sperandarum substantia
rerum, argumentum
non
apparentium</I> ("Faith is the substance of things hoped
for, the
conviction of
things unseen") reads <I>Hebrews </I>11:1, inviting the
faithful to
contemplate
the invisible but certain advent of the Eternal Jerusalem.
<sup><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
In
Ciocca's version, the invitation is tendered by an engineer
who is at once
an
empirical translator of the impractical into the realm of
practice and a
prophet
inhabited by a vision that can only be handed down in
imperfect form. Cold
calculation, planning, and practical details address only
his outer,
bodily eyes.
They are but the poor handmaidens of an inner
spiritual-technical eye
within
whose depths is reflected the higher goal: a better future
for humankind.

<p>
In the course of Italy's Fascist decades, this better future
was, for
Ciocca,
identified with corporatism. All his inventions, from mass
theaters to fast
houses to rationalist pig farms, strove to foreshadow and to
realize
corporatist
goals. The guided street is no exception. "The history of
transportation
systems
is one with the history of civilization" <I>(LSG,</I> 49),
Ciocca affirmed
in
<I>La strada guidata,</I> implying that the advent of a new
transportation
system
must always entail a reordering of the world.
<sup><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
In the case of
the
guided street, the system's very design is coupled tightly
to the "third"
way to
modernization celebrated in <I>Giudizio sul bolscevismo:</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

At the root of the antagonism between roads and rails stands
the conflict
between
freedom and constraint, between a liberty inherent to
roadways and a
constraint
inherent to railways. One doesn't have to be a philosopher
to understand
that all
physical or human actions occur in a context defined by the
interplay of
freedom
and constraint. Equilibrium too always occurs between
freedom and
constraint.
Accordingly, if we want to reconcile the truck and the
locomotive, we must
establish an equilibrium where now there is conflict by
balancing the
first's
freedom of movement with the second's subjection to rails.

<p>
<B></B>

<p>
Between anarchy and tyranny, between capitalist
individualism and communist
collectivism, between private sector interests and the
national interest,
the
guided street charts a corporatist middle course. In its
pursuit of
reconciliation between railway and roadway, it seeks to
eliminate neither.
Railways will continue to be built in the Fascist Eternal
Jerusalem, but
their
use will be limited to what they are best at: high-volume,
high-density
lines.
Roadways will also continue to built for use (mostly by
private parties) on
low-volume, low-density routes. Rather, Ciocca's faith
consisted in the
belief
that by creating a link between the two, the antagonism
would collapse and
in its
place would arise a unified three-tier system, held together
by its middle
term.
He believed that the guided street could function as a glue
because it
crystallized the values of efficiency, autarchy, and
discipline. Flexible
and
inexpensive, employing only "poor" building materials, it
was half as
narrow as a
highway and twice as flexible as a railroad. Both private
and state
vehicles
would be able to freely move on and off its network of
cement guide rails,
rejoining the roadway system at any given crossing. Once on
the network,
their
rate of movement could be standardized (thereby reducing
their consumption
of
fuel) as well as accelerated, since self-steering mechanisms
would reduce
the
driver's task to braking alone. Self-guidance would also
permit a
substantial
increase in the cargo-bearing and trailer-pulling capacities
of trucks.
Most of
all, movements along the grid could be someday be optimized
by
rationalizing the
roadway-railway-guided street links through central
planning: the "unity of
coordination will be absolute," Ciocca promised, and "will
make its
infinite
force felt in the case of war" <I>(LSG,</I> 249).
<sup><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>
Like the
corporate state, the guided grid disciplines and directs
independent
forces; it
preserves their relative autonomy but molds them into a
single
transcendent will.
It can place the nation on autopilot because, in effect,
Mussolini is in
every
driver's seat.

<p>
So, like Ciocca's mass theater designs and rural housing
projects, the
guided
street is yet another allegory of corporatism. What, then,
is one to make
of the
fact that Ciocca also sought to build it outside of the
corporatist fold?
Nationalist motives might well provide the answer. But what
of its postwar
continuation or, for that matter, of the postwar
continuation of Ciocca's
other
projects, whether in Italy or abroad? Any response to this
question,
however
provisional, must begin with a brief sketch of his
activities during
wartime and
in the immediate postwar. Late in the conflict, as would be
the case with
many
other Fascist intellectuals and engineers, Ciocca's
allegiances shifted
abruptly,
perhaps out of frustration with the Fascist bureaucracy,
and/or antiwar
feelings
(in the 1960s he became an avid antinuclear activist and
esperantist)
and/or for
reasons of opportunism. The same practical politician who
had once
celebrated
Hitler as possessing the "genius and intuition of an
exceptional leader,"
thus
began an entirely new political practice by spying for the
Italo-British
regional
military command between September 1944 and April 1945
<I>(LSG,</I>
103).
<sup><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
No less significantly, between 1943 and the early 1950s
Ciocca became a key planner in the reconstruction of the
Lombard region
under the
Fanfani Plans of 1945 and 1949. That these activities
predate even the end
of the
world conflict is far more typical than atypical, to judge
by the special
issues
that Gi&ograve; Ponti's magazine <I>Stile </I>was 

<B></B>

 already devoting to
postwar
reconstruction in 1943-44.
<sup><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>
In any event, by the end of 1945,
Ciocca
the rebuilder was every bit as active as had been Ciocca the
corporatist
builder.
But he had gained far greater momentum. On New Year's Day
1946, with Amos
Edallo,
Augusto Magnaghi, Luigi Mattioni, and Mario Terzaghi, he
presented the new
city
plan for Milan whose fourth article proposed "the
preparation of the
current
athletic zone for mass spectacles."
<sup><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>
In September he stood
before
the first National Congress for Industrial Reconstruction
pleading for the
mass
production of prefabricated housing as a remedy for Italy's
postwar woes
and
filed a proposal for building "small serially produced
houses of rapid
construction" in Milan. Many projects later, he was building
the Necchi
corporation Garden-Village in Pavia: a worker housing
complex directly
inspired
by his designs of the 1930s, intended to demonstrate the
efficiencies that
could
be achieved via industrialized construction. By 1950, he had
resumed his
full-tilt campaign to spread the gospel of the guided
roadway. In the
mid-1950s
he returned to designing cinemas and auditoriums, drainage
canals and
sewage
systems. His tool kit was again complete.

<p>
If Ciocca's story has a moral it is surely that "the circle
of the real"
is far
more contentious and far less orderly than his own
socio-economic and
technical
fantasies would seem to allow. The credo of intellectual
activism,
intransigeant
nationalism, a "realistic" faith in the redemptive potential
of certain
technologies, a vision of the state as a forceful agent of
social
coordination
and reform, a populism always teetering on the edge between
autoritarianism and
democracy, an idealization of the engineer as political
practitioner: all
these
beliefs constitute a relatively solid (though not
necessarily coherent)
ground
that is layered over with shifting stories and symbolic
investments. It is
not
that the latter leave no trace in the technological
artifacts themselves.
Rather,
these traces are always fragile and prone to slippage.
Between the
corporatist
village and the Necchi garden-village of postwar Pavia,
between the rapid
rural
house of Garlasco and the rapid mini-houses of Milan,
between a nation
piloted by
a transcendental dictator and a republic piloted by a
sovereign people,
there are
real differences, the differences of which history is
composed. But they
are
differences that a half-empiricist, half-fideist dedication
to building "a
future
for humankind" can overcome.

Because of their technical training--which is to say, basic
mathematics,
basic
tehnics; the habit of simple, useful, coherent solutions
deriving from
mechanics;
an approach to social problems based on scientific factors
and not
"art"--engineers are prone to an "artistic" interpretation
of modern life
that is
far more authentic than that of individuals trained in

Responding to the last part of your letter, I do recognize
how much you
have done
for us. Yet to say that the project sprouted in forty-eight
hours from
your mind
like Minerva from the brains of Jove, and that the project
belongs to
Ciocca the
engineer and not the RIV, seems to me a bit too much: I have
on my desk a
substantial number of drafts that were done one after
another, drafts that
were
discussed by all the engineers of the RIV and also by me.
Each successive
draft
has been an improvement over its predecessor, until we have

that it has

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT19" HREF="#REF19">19</a>.
Archival records seem to suggest two possible explanations:
a) that
the test
results belied Ciocca and Piccin's claims that construction
costs for the
guided
street would be greatly inferior to those for highways and
railways, so the
Soviets simply abandoned the experiment; or b) that the
initial results
were
promising enough to convince the Soviets of the guided
street's military
potential, which prompted them to demand exclusive control
over Ciocca's
patents.
In his subsequent writings Ciocca would claim the latter:

Nervi, the architect for Florence's Stadio Berta (now Campo

his proposal: "The study of a grand Stadium is one of the
most beautiful
themes
available to any builder." (The original reads: "Lo studio

In a letter to Antonio Bruers, the vice-chancellor of the

D'Amico
communicated the president's intentions: "Pirandello
himself, having noted
a
certain weakness in the Italian contributions to the
conference, has had
the idea
of inviting the engineer Gaetano Ciocca to give a lecture on
the theme
'Theatrical Architecture: Mass Theaters and Smaller
Theaters.' Ciocca is
very
close to <I>il Duce</I> and was praised by him in a note in
the <I>Popolo
d'Italia, </I>and with great competence has concerned
himself with these
matters." (The original reads: "Lo stesso Pirandello, anche
perch&egrave;
nota
una certa fiacchezza nelle relazioni di italiani al
Convegno, ha avuto
l'idea di
invitare a farvi una relazione sul tema 'Architettura
teatrale: teatri di
masse e
teatrini' quell'Ing. Gaetano Ciocca che, personalmente caro
al Duce e da
Lui
personalmente lodato in un corsivo del <I>Popolo d'Italia,

Gaetano Ciocca's project is a marvel not only from the
standpoint of its
practicality but also--at least to judge by the model--as an
architectural
monument. Yet I am troubled, let this rest among us, by the
strange
circumstance
that, as is typical of our era, architects and set designers
have stepped
forward
to solve the dramatic theater's problems before authors
could do so. What
I mean
to say is that these architects, however great a genius
Gropius might be
and
however great maybe my personal admiration for Ciocca,
sometimes give the
impression of having placed the cart before the horse.

Compare Nervi in his Roman stadium project:

Let's take as an example the building of a large stadium in
Rome. Its first
essential feature would be Romanity which, as I see it, can

by

the
powerful effect of a single rhythm shaped from structural

da mangiare

un'architettura di
Piacentini; bisogna farlo diventare un'architettura di Le

questo,
aveva costruito certi ambienti pulitissimi e bene aerati,

trogolo
era fatto in modo tale che il cibo . . . vi scorreva <I>fino

sufficente. C'era poi una vaschetta: il porco spingeva con

al cesso
. . . . Appena finito di mangiare e di bere, in principio
gli dava una
bacchettata dolorosa avviandolo verso il gabinetto. Dopo
alcuni giorni il
porco,
ci andava senza alcun stimolo. Ciocca ebbe in tal modo
risultati
strabilanti:
carni pulite, batteriologicamente pure; porci non
appesantiti da grasso
malsano,
ma asciutti ed eleganti. . . . Ma il progetto non ebbe
seguito
perch&egrave; i
porci nutriti al Grand-H&ocirc;tel pesavano al massimo
sessanta chili e

The statement is repeated and ritually praised at numerous
junctures
of <I>La
strada guidata: </I>"Il Capo del governo diede un suo
giudizio lapidario:
<I>questa non &egrave; una strada, &egrave; una ferrovia,
</I>nel quale
&egrave;
veramente l'essenza della strada guidata" (34; italics in
original).

The original reads: "Si &egrave; mostrato seccato della
mancata
realizzazione
e dopo una interessante conversazione . . . mi ha chiesto se
avevo un
programma.
Gli risposi che il programma era di costruire una
societ&agrave; per la
costruzione e l'esercizio di strade guidate di emanazione
della IRI e con
intervento anche di capitali privati. Alla sua domanda,
quale ministero
doveva
occuparsene risposi, naturalmente, quello delle
communicazioni. Seduta
stante il
Duce telefon&ograve; al ministro Benni per un convegno
l'indomani mattina
con il
comm. Menichella della IRI" (Ciocca to Count Piero Fogaccia,
8 January
1938, AC,
Corrisp. SIAC).

The original reads: "le bozze sono arrivate . . . Il
Ministero ha
accordato
il nulla osta 'pur facendo rilevare che il Ministero delle
Comunicazioni
fa delle
riserve sulle teorie esposte nel volume.' Non mi parrebbe il
caso di
scrivere a
Sebastiani [Mussolini's secretary]" (Valentino Bompiani to
Gaetano Ciocca,
27
July 1939, AC, Corrisp. Bompiani).

These points are detailed in an IRI report,
"Possibilit&agrave; di
applicazione della strada guidata = Sistema Ing. Ciocca," 11
October 1939,
ACS,
Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri 1937-39, box
7-1-2.545; and in a
report by
the CNR's Commissione Centrale per l'Esame delle Invenzioni
("Parere

The original reads: "Questa strada guidata &egrave; stata
per me una
odissea,
non nei mari azzurri delle sirene, ma negli uffici, nelle
anticamere, fra
gli
scogli degli interessi privati."

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT82" HREF="#REF82">82</a>.
The original reads: "Quando Stephenson costru&igrave; la
prima
locomotiva,
lenta, debole e imperfetta, egli non poteva immaginare quali
miglioramenti
essa
avrebbe in seguito ricevuto n&egrave; quali benefici avrebbe
apportato
all'umanit&agrave;. La sicurezza nell'avvenire della
ferrovia, che lo
muoveva,
gli derivava non dagli argomenti concreti, ma dalla fede. La
fede &egrave;
appunto l'argomento delle cose che non appariscono e che
ancora non sono
concrete, pur essendo certe. Tutto il progresso &egrave;
derivato, non dai
freddi
calcoli, ma dalla fede nell'avvenire dell'umanit&agrave;."

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT83" HREF="#REF83">83</a>.
Given Ciocca's tendency to pepper all his writings with
quotations from
Dante, his version may have been filtered through the
<I>Commedia:</I>
"fede
&egrave; sustanza di cose sperate / e argomento de le non
parventi"
(Dante, <I>La
Divina Commedia. Paradiso,</I> eds. Umberto Bosco and
Giovanni Reggio
[Florence:
Le Monnier, 1979], 402).

The original reads: "La storia dei trasporti si confonde con
la storia
della
civilt&agrave;."

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT85" HREF="#REF85">85</a>.
The original reads: "Vi &egrave; dunque, alla base
dell'antagonismo
fra la
strada e la ferrovia, il contrasto fra una libert&agrave; e
un vincolo, una
libert&agrave; ingenita nella strada e un vincolo ingenito
nella ferrovia.
Non
occorre essere filosofi, per conoscere che, in ogni azione
naturale od
umana, il
contrasto &egrave; sempre fra una libert&agrave; e un
vincolo. Ma anche
l'equilibrio &egrave; sempre fra una libert&agrave; e un
vincolo. Di
conseguenza,
se vogliamo conciliare l'autocarro con la locomotiva,
dobbiamo raggiungere
l'equilibrio l&agrave; ove &egrave; il contrasto,
conciliando la guida
volontaria
del primo con la guida obbligata dell'altra" (quoted in
Gaetano Ciocca,
"Prove in
Roma di strada guidata," <I>Industria Italiana del
Cemento</I> 9 [October
1937]:
287).

<a NAME="FOOT86" HREF="#REF86">86</a>.
The original reads: "L'unit&agrave; di direzione sar&agrave;
quindi
assoluta.
Essa far&agrave; sentire, in caso di guerra, la sua infinita
forza."

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT87" HREF="#REF87">87</a>.
The original reads: "Le autostrade tedesche . . .
appartengono a
quell'ordine
di iniziative ardite e lungimiranti che soltanto la
genialit&agrave; e
l'intuito
di un capo eccezionale come Hitler, sostenuto dalla
volont&agrave; di
azione di
un popolo unito e senza discordie, &egrave; in grado di
prendere." Ciocca's
contribution to the Resistance is documented in a ministry
of war
certificate
(signed "U. Turrini"), 15 October 1945, AC, Documenti
Personali, Cimeli
file; and
in "Attestazione di Benemerenza" (signed "Alfredo Verani
Masin") issued by
the
Corpo Volontari della Libert&agrave;, AC, Documenti
Personali, Cimeli file
