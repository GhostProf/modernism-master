<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A tale of rape, carnage, and Futurist declamation set in Africa,
Marinetti's 1909 <I>Mafarka le Futuriste</I> takes as its theme the
generation of a mechanical son born of male parthenogenesis. In the
opening scene its protagonist Mafarka-el-Bar, an Arabian king with
imperial ambitions to conquer all of Africa, has recently defeated an army
of black Africans and dethroned his uncle, King Boubassa. Those ambitions,
both imperial and Futurist, will finally be satisfied, however, not by
Mafarka but by the son he constructs without the aid of what the text
refers to as the "vulva." The novel thus combines a number of elements
that might be called fascist: a rhetoric of virility, imperial fantasies
tied to the colonization of Africa, misogyny, a reproductive project,
and an obsession with self-sufficiency. Grounding itself on the notion
that the ideological specificity of a discourse or text is to be found
not in the single ideas that circulate within it, but rather in the
relations and articulations among elements, my project in this essay is
to map out the ideo-logic that binds together the elements above, and
to suggest a parallel articulation of elements in fascist discourse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If <I>Mafarka</I> is a Futurist text that looks ahead to fascism, it
also looks back to nineteenth-century orientalism. Like Flaubert's
<I>Salammb&ocirc;</I>, to which it is often disparagingly compared,
<I>Mafarka</I> is a novel immersed in an orientalist world into which
no self-identified Western narrator intrudes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The only "Western" voice to be heard is that of Marinetti in the
 preface, where he identifies himself with his "barbarian" theme: "Am
 I not a barbarian, at least for those false devotees of progress?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Within the novel itself, the perspective camouflages itself as
non-Western, even producing a reverse orientalism in which the
West, and Western women, are the source of exoticism. But unlike
<I>Salammb&ocirc;</I>, a novel resolutely without a future, <I>Mafarka</I>
ends both with the obliteration of the earth and with the birth of a
superhuman creature who will rule over a new world. The orientalist
notion that the West will be reborn, revitalized, by returning to the
East, a notion that appears in the narrative setting of the "founding
manifesto" and "Let's Kill the Moonlight" as well, thus informs the
narrative structure of the novel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 As Liz Constable has noted, at least one of the functions of the African
 setting is to invert the ration of the Eastern/African other as
 belonging to a time period different from that occupied by the West.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The notion that African peoples are "primitive," that they presently
 occupy a place in the West's past, is simply overturned so that they
 now occupy the place of the West's future, with all the orientalist
 notions about atrociously "primitive" qualities still intact.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Into this setting is introduced a reproductive fantasy: the novel's
project, in its own terms, is to bypass the vulva and impregnate the
ovary that is the male spirit: "the spirit of man," proclaims Marinetti
in the preface, "is an unused ovary...It is we who will fertilize it
for the first time <I>[la premi&egrave;re fois]!</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The narrative impetus for this fantasy is provided by the death of
 Mafarka's beloved brother Magamal, who contracts rabies and dies after
 ripping his bride to shreds and reducing her to what the text pleasantly
 refers to as "scarlet mud" (<I>M</I>, 134). Gazourmah, the mechanical
 son, is to be the immortal substitute for the dead brother. A sort
 of Futurist Geppetto (Mafarka in fact sculpts his son from a piece of
 oak), Mafarka's reasons for creating his own kin are less than kind--to
 women. The transplant of the ovary to the male spirit is necessitated by
 the unabashedly misogynist desire for procreation without procreative
 sex: in his "<I>discours futuriste</I>" (<I>M</I>, 163), Mafarka
 jubilantly announces that "it is possible to procreate an immortal
 giant from one's own flesh, without concourse and stinking complicity
 with woman's womb."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course this is not really "<I>la premi&egrave;re fois</I>" that such
a fantasy has been conceived; my use of the term autarchy is meant, in
fact, not only to anticipate its later fascist use but also to evoke
its much earlier classical sources--the Greek <I>autarkeia</I> was used
to refer to Jason's desire for self-sufficiency in a world without
women. Marinetti's claim to originality may seem at least partially
justified by the form that the son assumes, for Gazourmah takes shape
as an airplane, and, as part human flesh and part mechanical structure,
qualifies as an early cyborg: "With my very own hands I sculpted my son
in the wood of a young oak...I found a mixture/formula that transforms
vegetable fibres into living flesh and firm muscles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 But unlike the cyborgs theorized by Donna Haraway--the transgressive,
 oppositional creatures who conjure up visions of a postmodern, postgender
 world--Marinetti's Gazourmah is born of a dream of male parthenogenesis
 that rests on philosophical foundations that are not quite so shiny
 and new.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Jean-Joseph Goux nicely encapsulates those foundations when he writes
 of philosophical idealism that is "is first of all a conception of
 conception."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 That conception is one in which woman supplies matter, and man supplies
 form; its progeny is the philosophical opposition between matter and
 spirit; and

<B></B>

its dream is that of immaculate conception or, as Goux also puts it,
"scissiparous reproduction, sexless procreation" in which value reproduces
itself, concepts spawn concepts, and fathers create sons, all without
"mother" or "labor," "out of desire and form alone" (<I>SE</I>, 199).
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Goux's formulation points to the way in which the sexual and the economic
are necessarily intertwined in the fantasy of male autarchy. But in
acting out the fantasy of male autarchy that underlies this project, an
additional factor emerges, for the novel finds itself in the bonds--the
double bonds--of the "homesexual panic" theorized by Eve Sedgwick.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Sedgwick has analyzed this double bind, and resultant panic, as a
 product of the prescription of homosocial behavior (male bonding) and
 equally strong proscription of homosexual behavior that characterizes
 all patriarchal, heterosexual culture. Within such cultures, the
 boundaries between the homosocial and the homosexual are unstable,
 and that instability works to regulate, in more or less terroristic
 fashion, all bonds between men. In <I>Mafarka</I>, as in the manifestos,
 the elimination of woman brings into view this boundary dispute and
 its attendant panic. In <I>Mafarka</I>, woman is to be eliminated not
 only as <I>matrice, mater</I>, empty receptacle, but also as "vulva,"
 as object of sexual desire. Indeed, the part of woman to be bypassed is
 more often referred to as "<I>vulve</I>" than as <I>matrice</I>" or womb,
 thereby underscoring the sexual relation and producing the repeated,
 odd formulation "I gave birth to my son without the aid of the vulva!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 As we shall see, the form that the "homosexual panic" assumes in this
 novel is somewhat different from the form it takes in the manifestos,
 where the question of the correct proximity of man to man is red
 as a question of the correct proximity of man to woman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In <I>Mafarka</I>, instead, it is the question of the correct proximity
 between male mother and son that causes panic, and requires the
 reintroduction of the woman as mother. What does remain constant,
 however, is the question of proximity itself, now overcoded so that
 it is not only a question of the correct proximity of man to woman,
 but also of the proximity of Futurist Europe to its once and future
 colonies. In both cases, what is at stake is the transfer of properties:
 from women to men (a transfer red in the "male ovary"), and from
 Africa to a (linguistically) Franco-Italian West. Not surprisingly,
 this latter transfer is red on the model of the dominant pair:
 Africa is introduced metonymically in the first chapter, "Le viol
 des N&eacute;gresses" (The violation of negresses) as the racialized,
 sexualized body to be raped.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here in his African novel the "lyrical obsession with matter"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 of Marinetti's later "Technical Manifesto" appears instead as a lyrical
 obsession with <I>mater</I>--both with deanimating whatever is animate
 and gendered female, turning mother into matter, and with becoming a
 male mother. Both transformations are already internal to the project
 of idealism, as Goux describes it in his chapter on "Sexual Difference
 and History": the role of the mother is that of lifeless, formless
 matter, and the father's role, insofar as it is the purely ideological
 (as opposed to physiological) one of "cultural gestation," is that of
 "social mother" (<I>SE</I>, 224). It is as though <I>Mafarka</I> were
 the literalization of its philosophical underpinnings: Mafarka's own
 beloved mother,

<B></B>

Langourama, is a mummy--lifeless flesh preserved as object of
veneration--while Mafarka himself becomes the "social mother" and
cultural gestator of Futurism when he pronounces his "<I>discours
futuriste</I>." As I have suggested, in <I>Mafarka</I> these
transformations are bound up with "homosexual panic": we might say, in
fact, that becoming a male mother is the (however baffling) solution to
the problem at the heart of the novel: How can one remain a heterosexual
male once sexual relations with women have been eliminated? As it
turns out, of course, all mothers, including Mafarka himself, end up
deanimated, and all mothers, including Mafarka himself, end up having
sexual relations with men. But the logic of this exchange of question
(how to remain heterosexual) and answer (become a male mother) is the
structuring (and unconscious) ideo-logic of the novel.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The deanimation of female matter does not, however, imply its elimination
from the text. One of the conditions of being able to procreate without
the complicity of the "vulva" appears to be that the "vulva" must
paradoxically be everywhere present; as Kaplan has noted, "femininity"
is attributed to almost everything in the novel: landscape, objects,
Mafarka's brother Magamal, even Mafarka himself by the end, after he
has embraced his mummified mother and become a mother himself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Mafarka finds himself immersed in what Edward Said has called the
 "deep rich fund of female sexuality" characteristic of a certain
 orientalism which here functions to make his repeated refusals of
 women's propositions seem all the more heroic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 More importantly, though Mafarka rails against the debilitating effect
 of sexual relations with women, he is everywhere surrounded by scenes of
 rape. The "vulva" must not only be everywhere present but also always
 open to violence: the relation to matter is almost always red as
 heterosexual rape, as sexual violence against feminized matter or against
 female characters. Indeed, rape remains the relation to matter even for
 Gazourmah, Mafarka's mechanical son, who begins to spout the rhetoric
 of rape at birth and soon after finds himself some yielding breezes to
 violate. My analysis of the rhetoric of virility in the manifestos has
 suggested why this should be: in the homophobic logic of the text, female
 matter must always be open to violence in order to maintain the border
 between virility and what Marinetti slurringly refers to as "pederasty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what happens when a male becomes a mother, becomes matter in relation
to a mechanical son? The novel gives us two examples of possible relations
between mother and son: Mafarka's own relation to his mummy, and the
relation of (the hallucinated?) Coloubbi, Mafarka's abruptly introduced
ex-girlfriend, to Gazourmah. In the first case, reverence of the dead is
combined with a strange surrogacy, for by constructing Gazourmah, Mafarka
aims to give his mother a replacement for her dead son Magamal: he becomes
his mother's surrogate mother. Langourama is the only female character
in the novel not to be presented as a body to be raped, but it should
be noted that she is <I>already</I> inert matter. This might suggest
not that the mother is exempt from the sexual relation, but that it has
already taken place (at least phantasmatically), and had the consequence
consistent with the logic of the text. This suggestion is shored up by
Langourama's literary precedents (in Gautier's <I>Pied de Momie</I>,
for example, it is the object of desire who is mummified) and borne out by

<B></B>

Mafarka's reaction to Coloubbi's attempt at seduction, which Mafarka
rebuffs because it reminds him of mom: "With a very slow movement of
her soft and terrible arm, Coloubbi again drew Mafarka's mouth to her
breast...Suddenly he started, horrified, and cried: Oh! Don't make the
gesture of my mother!...Your breasts are cursed and exhausted!...Go away!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Coloubbi's own claim to be Gazourmah's mother provides further
 confirmation of the sexual nature of the relation between mother and
 son. Thus, while in relation to the "Futurist discourse" of the novel,
 Coloubbi clearly stands for the passatist nostalgia for <I>amour</I> and
 <I>clair de lune</I> that the Futurist Mafarka must overcome in order
 to give birth to his son, in relation to the economy outlined here,
 her importance lies in her sudden appearance as competing mother. She
 claims to be Gazourmah's true mother precisely because she is his lover:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He is my son, you know, for his first glance was for me!...I melted with
pleasure beneath the rough caress of his eyes!...And he is also my lover,
and I abandoned myself to his caprices in that first glance!...You see:
I enjoy atrociously, by myself, beneath his male strength that already
dreams of killing me, emptying his veins into mine!

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mother love, it would seem, is inseparable from annihilating incest.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kaplan has noted that both Mafarka and the narrative break down at this
point: Coloubbi's claim causes Mafarka to dissolve into tears, and sends
the narrative off onto a detour.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Kaplan argues that the breakdown signals an involuntary return to the
 maternal, occasioned by the threat of total feminization; I would argue
 that the narrative stalls as it attempts to re out a way to re
 the male mother's incestuous relation with the son as heterosexual. After
 all, according to the heterosexual imperative of the text, Gazourmah
 should rape his mother, should rape Mafarka; the homophobic ideologic
 of the text cannot permit this, however, because Gazourmah's "mother"
 is his "father": father-son incest cannot be staged. This conundrum
 occasions the return to the maternal, which takes place in the form
 of Mafarka's search for his "<I>momie maternelle</I>" (maternal mummy
 [<I>M</I>, 218]), Langourama, who then issues an order: "Mafarka! Kiss
 your son for me too, on the mouth!...Don't forget!" The order is clearly
 a relief to Mafarka: "Then a cry of joy relieved Mafarka's breast. He
 leapt toward his son, like the gush of a fountain." Made the bearer
 of an incestuous, but heterosexually incestuous, kiss, Mafarka can
 return to his son as a man turns from a wife to a lover; the rhetoric of
 justification is that of the supposedly unwilling adulterer, pushed into
 the arms of the "other woman": "Oh caressing breath of my mother!...You
 push me into the arms of my son!...You command me to annihilate my own
 body, giving him life!" It is at this moment in the novel that Mafarka
 is most clearly, and culturally, a mother, at the same time as he most
 clearly exhibits the forbearance marked as virile: "Oh my son! Oh my
 lord!...I have given everything, for you! By dint of fasts and bloody
 sacrifices and prayers, I saved my will from dependence on drink or on
 a fascinating color or on the perfume of a woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Kaplan quite correctly glosses the first three exclamations of this
 passage as marking a failure of will: Mafarka is the martyred mother, a
 "total woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 But the second half ("By dint of fasts...") introduces a rather different
 element, for this

<B></B>

is a rhetoric of virility that quite specifically marks this mother as a
male who can withstand the distraction women's perfume can cause to the
"olfactory imagination of the male."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In other words, Mafarka is both the sacrificing, devoted mother who
 gives all to her child and the male who succeeds in maintaining
 both will and virility, for as we know from the later manifesto
 "Contro il lusso femminile" (Against feminine excess) a mere whiff
 of a woman's perfume, a touch of a fine fabric, may sometimes lead to
 "pederasty." And by bearing the mother's kiss, Mafarka is able to give
 life to his son not through the lips of the vulva, but through those
 of his own mouth. Gazourmah comes to life under the kiss of his male
 mother: "Here is my soul!...Give me your lips and open your mouth to
 my kiss!...And he threw himself about the neck of his son, and pressed
 his own mouth onto the sculpted mouth. Immediately the formidable body
 of Gazourmah started violently, and his powerful wings sprung open."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 A page later, of course, Mafarka meets the fate of all that is feminine
 in the text, as he, too, is reduced to inert matter. But here the
 homoerotic kiss is stolen under cover of familial relations, through
 the mother's interposed kiss, and as a same-sex version of Pygmalion,
 who, like Mafarka, was driven to sculpt out of scorn for women. As
 in <I>Come si seducono le donne</I> (How to seduce women), where the
 Futurist male can <I>inculare</I> neutralists' wives while ting
 for the nation's borders, here the homoerotic fantasy is smuggled in
 <I>as</I> heterosexual.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The narrative introduction of a competing incestuous mother (Coloubbi)
and its detour to Mafarka's own mother (who gives permission to commit
incest) were thus motivated by a requirement of what Luce Irigary has
called the male hom(m)o-sexual economy. By male hom(m)o-sexual economy,
Irigaray means the patriarchal, exogamic economy in which women are
exchanged among, and serve as the mediation and alibi for relations
(economic as well as sexual) between, men. It is important to distinguish
this double-<I>m</I>-ed hom(m)o-sexuality from homosexuality, which
refers instead to male same-sex relations that are at once required by
and yet subversive of that economy. This is a familiar formulation,
for it recalls Eve Sedgwick's notion of the double bind whereby male
homosociality is prescribed but male homosexuality proscribed. For
Irigaray, male same-sex relations are subversive insofar as they forgo the
prescribed mediation through women and put into circulation the phallus
that serves as (excluded) universal equivalent, and thus deprive the
economy of its "money." In other words, male same-sex relations would
bankrupt the hom(m)o-sexual economy. Within that economy, then, neither
male homosexuality nor father-son incest may be openly avowed, for,
as Irigaray writes, "they openly interpret the law according to which
society operates."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In <I>Mafarka</I>, the evocation of mother-son incest is thus the
 displacement of the alibi for father-son incest, of the pederastic
 relation (and at this point I take "pederasty" out of the quotation
 marks that contained it as Marinetti's slur on all male same-sex
 relations). Within the economy of the text, the openness of this
 particular scene is paid for in the final pages of the novel, where
 the mediation through women is less than delicately restored in the
 dialogue between Gazourmah and the (linguistically feminine) "Mocking
 Breezes." I quote at length to show how "costly" the scene has been:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Surely there are other ways to imagine the relation between an airplane
and the clouds through which it flies, but even as airplane, the
transcendent male spirit needs to negate matter <I>as</I> female. The
by now tedious insistence upon rape as the basis of even the superhuman
Gazourmah's relation to feminized matter serves both to reaffirm the
heterosexual imperative, and to throw into high relief the anomaly of
the tender kiss exchanged between Mafarka and son. The "cost" of this
reaffirmation is the success of Mafarka's project, for this is the
relation to the "vulva" that Mafarka has railed against throughout the
novel, and that Gazourmah's vulva-less birth was meant to bypass. The
narrative, however, plays itself out in triumphant Futurist mode as
though oblivious to the loop in which its own project is caught. This
is no send up of idealism, but rather a rehearsal of its foundations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
That rehearsal is repeated in the "apocalyptic" scenes in the novel. In
both cases those scenes are apocalypses of heterosexuality. The first
is the "<I>d&eacute;bauche v&eacute;g&eacute;tale</I>" (vegetable orgy
[<I>M</I>, 200]) that immediately follows Mafarka's close call with
Coloubbi; he almost gives in to the temptation of nostalgia, and in the
place of surrender makes a burnt offering to the Hurricane that arises
inexplicably to threaten Gazourmah. The offering is the vegetable orgy;
male tree trunks and virile bowsprits are consumed by naked female
flames; ships tossed by the sea become "<I>tartanes en chaleur</I>"
(tartans in heat [<I>M</I>, 200]); Mafarka as pimp races about preparing
his own personal holocaust: "And Mafarka did not tire of running here
and there like a lugubrious pimp, preparing beds of lust for the loves
of these red goddesses! He arranged both young and centuagenarian trunks
on mattresses of leaves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 No noun enters this description without being both personified and
 gendered, and there is no relation that is not a (hetero)sexual one. Even
 the night during which the orgy takes place is personified as a woman
 in labor, giving birth to an unknown world: "the Night swelled her
 laboring belly. To what world would she give birth?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The question thematizes the function of the apocalypse itself; it seems
 to want to mark the death of the sexual relation to woman, and in its
 place put the parturition of the male mother: "Oh! The joy of having
 given birth to you thus, handsome and pure of all the defects that
 come from the maleficent vulva and predispose one to decrepitude and
 death!...Yes, you are immortal, my son!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 The implicit reference to Pandora, whose

<B></B>

birth inaugurated not only sickness and death but also introduced the
"damnable race of women" to mankind,
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 makes it clear that the world about to be born reinaugurates a
 pre-Pandoran state, yet that pre-Pandoran state cannot be imagined except
 through mediation by women or the feminine. Similarly, the pages that
 follow the dramatic dialogue quoted above describe the earth convulsed
 by quakes and engulfed in volcanic eruption as Gazourmah flies off to
 dethrone the sun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The destruction of the earth is simultaneous with the destruction of
 Coloubbi: "by killing me you kill the Earth!"

 Male spirit once again deanimates female matter as the condition of
 its very existence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The kiss between male mother and son is not entirely unprecedented
in the novel, however, for Mafarka's relation to his brother Magamal
similarly appears to smuggle in homoerotic relations under the cover
of the proximate relations of the family, and within the sheltering
boundaries of the so-called Sotadic zone. Given the orientalist context,
it seems appropriate to adopt this term coined by Richard Burton, the
orientalist and translator of the <I>Arabian Nights</I>, in order to
refer to a topography of "pederasty." Burton considers "pederasty" to
be "geographical and climatic, not racial"; within the Sotadic zone,
Burton writes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the Vice is popular and endemic, held at the worst to be a mere
peccadillo, whilst the races to the North and South of the limits here

When Burton mentions the "limits here defined" he refers not to some vague
geographical region, but rather to very precise coordinates, as follows:

1. There exists what I shall call a "Sotadic Zone" bounded westwards by
the northern shores of the Mediterranean (N. Lat. 43 degrees) and by the
southern (N. Lat. 30 degrees). Thus the depth would be 780 to 800 miles
including meridional France, the Iberian peninsula, Italy and Greece,
with the coast-regions of Africa from Marocco to Egypt.

From a narrow Mediterranean strip, the zone expands to "embrace" and
"enfold" an area so great as to encompass nearly the entire globe and,
moving steadily eastward from North America, seems to be encroaching
upon even the place from which the Englishman speaks.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Marinetti's imaginary geography, then, where Egypt, Morocco, and
central Africa seem to coexist, we are safely within the zone. But not
so safe as not to require that "Sotadic love" be red as brotherly
love. Magamal is blatantly feminized: he has "feminine graces" and, with
his "<I>corps de caoutchouc</I>" (body of rubber [<I>M</I>, 29]),

<B></B>

makes his appearance for the first time in the novel as if in response
to Mafarka's desire for an "ardent, elastic virgin."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 But the more interesting case is recounted in the tale that Mafarka tells
 the African king, Brafane-el-Kibir, as part of his strategy to conquer
 him and take his lands. Ironically, the story turns out to recount
 Mafarka's previous and recent success in precisely such an endeavour;
 introduced as the story of the horse trader, the stuffed fish, and the
 devil, it is also the story of Mafarka's usurpation of his uncle King
 Boubassa's power. Indeed, the tale can be read as a mise-en-abyme of
 the entire novel for, like Mafarka, Gazourmah has imperial ambitions;
 he aims to dethrone not an uncle but the Sun itself, and become king not
 of Africa but of the firmament. Briefly, the story recounts how Mafarka
 the horse trader sells a marvelous horse to the devil, disguised as a
 rich merchant (in obvious counterpoint to Mafarka, who is disguised as
 a poor beggar as he tells the tale). The wondrous stallion, whose red
 mane and tail ignite in the wind, and whose purple, sapphire-encrusted
 <I>zeb</I> is the dream of all the girls of the city (<I>zeb</I> is in
 fact Arabic slang for "dick"), turns out not to be a reliable means
 of transportation for he cannot resist an opportunity to copulate:
 "Completely drunk from the smell of the moist vulva, he tossed his
 whiplike mane against the flanks of the female, who started at the
 burning sensation, delivering terrible kicks. Thus the Devil, even
 though an excellent horseman, was thrown from the saddle three times."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Engaged, the Devil decides to get his revenge by castrating the horse
 and serving up its <I>zeb</I> to Mafarka as a stuffed fish, delicately
 prepared with curdled milk, violets, and cinnamon. Unaware, Mafarka
 eats the stuffed penis and immediately exhibits the same behavior as
 the horse, copulating with everything female in sight. As his violence
 grows, so does his own penis until it eventually reaches its maximum
 length of eleven meters, is mistaken for a rope curled next to him as
 he sleeps and then, as it is tied to a sail, becomes the mast of the
 ship that is his body. In this way Mafarka sails to Tell-el-Kibir, where
 King Boubassa hears the story and insists upon personally experiencing
 the virtues of such a miraculous <I>zeb</I>. The <I>zeb</I> in question
 is of course Mafarka's own at this point, and he hastens to comply with
 the King's request:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This single exception to the femaleness of the object of sexual violence
goes unremarked in the text, as Brafane-el-Kibir breaks in to ask about
the fate of the castrated stallion, still wandering about looking for its
lost <I>zeb</I>. The final scene (to which I shall return) is important,
however, not only as the culmination of the story of how Mafarka comes
to power, but also as the last exchange in what I will argue is a fable
of phallic economics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fabular and fabulous character of the story recalls tales of both
Scheherazade and Boccaccio. Mafarka's strategy, like Scheherazade's,
aims to gain power through storytelling; as in Boccaccio's tales of the
eating of hearts, the object that serves as

<B></B>

the catalyst of the story's plot is consumed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 When hearts are eaten in the <I>Decameron</I>, they are eaten as signs
 of nobility (the gentle heart) and as the consummation of a love for
 which the heart is the metaphor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 The consumption of the heart is not an act of cannibalism but rather
 the culinary consummation of a prohibited sexual relation. In the
 context of the (homophobic) homerotics of Marinetti's text, it seems
 all too easy to read the consumption of the <I>zeb</I> as yet another
 thinly disguised (homo)sexual act. But what is different about eating
 a stuffed penis is that, within a phallic economy, you are eating the
 general equivalent; you are, in other words, eating the gold standard
 of your libidinal economy, gobbling up your own capital.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may help to translate the tale into more explicitly economic terms,
in the wake of Marx, Goux, and Irigaray. Goux in fact points to what
would seem to be an analogous example of eating in Marx (without,
however, footnoting the exact location in Marx's work): as their empire
declined, the ancient Romans were given to eating pearl salads during
their orgies. The intertwining of the sexual and the economic in the
ingestion of pearls is what particularly interests Goux: what does it
mean to eat pearls, and why do so within the context of an orgy? Why is
it so economically and sexually perverse? The economic perversion, Marx
tells us, lies in treating wealth as though it had a direct use-value. Yet
pearls, of course, have no known nutritional value and it is therefore
blatantly not their use-value that is consumed; rather, they are
consumed <I>as</I> exchange value. As a quasi-money, pearls are consumed
insofar as they stand as general equivalent and hence as "the abstract
potential of all <I>jouissances</I>" (<I>SE</I>,  207). The pearl-eating
Romans, Goux concludes, found <I>jouissance</I> in the general power of
<I>jouissance</I>, imaginary satisfaction in the fetishism of exchange
value. The price of this imaginary satisfaction is great (and not only
for one's digestive tract), for in order to find <I>jouissance</I> in
the use of the general equivalent, one must renounce all exchange;
the economy falls apart. Now, Goux has no difficulty (perhaps too
little difficulty?) translating this into the libidinal economy: for
the penis to be the phallus, that is, to be the general equivalent, it
must be prohibited from immediate use value, which Goux identifies as
masturbation, and from immediate relative exchange value, which Goux
identifies as incest. As an analogy, or isomorph, to those pearl salads,
Goux offers an example from Sade of masturbation before piles of gold;
our own example from Marinetti works perhaps even better, for not only
does it represent a similar entwining of the sexual and the economic,
but it reveals, via Irigaray, a blindness in Goux's argument. Iragaray's
analysis of the hom(m)o-sexual economy also addresses the consequences of
treating the general equivalent that is the phallus as use-value: when,
as she writes, the "penis itself becomes merely a means to pleasure, of
pleasure among men, <I>the phallus loses its power</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Short-circuiting the commerce that is the exchange of women,
 male homosexuality, as we have said, eats the capital of
 hom(m)o-sexuality. Goux is thus both right and wrong when he points
 to incest as the equivalent of eating pearls: right insofar as what is
 at stake is the violation of exogamy, but wrong insofar as he seems to
 assume that it is only mother-son incest that is at issue. In Mafarka's
 story, the use of the penis as relative

<B></B>

exchange value is red as uncle-son incest, and the loss of phallic
power that it entails is fantasized instead as its explicit reversal. That
is to say, Mafarka <I>gains</I> the power of the king, the general
equivalent in the political realm, in precisely the moment that he,
in theory, loses phallic power by using the general equivalent in the
libidinal realm for pleasure between men. The lubrication for this
reversal is supplied by a recoding that takes place within the scene
itself; the consensual sexual relation between men (the king asks and
Mafarka complies) is, necessarily for the hom(m)o-sexual, homophobic
economy, recoded as a political rape: "<I>lui ravit le sceptre</I>"
(he stole/ravished his scepter [<I>M</I>, 64]).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mafarka's story of the <I>zeb</I> is not, however, only or even
principally a sexual fantasy; as in the Romans' orgiastic consumption
of pearls, the sexual fantasy is bound up with an economic fantasy. The
story also tells the tale of an increasingly "primitive" economy; it
begins with an exchange that takes place within a money economy, as
Mafarka sells the horse to the Devil, and then moves quickly to what
we might call a barter economy as the Devil takes his revenge. Revenge,
after all, seems to be based upon the principle of barter: the exchange
of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, is in principle no different
from the exchange of a horse for a pig. From revenge, the tale seems to
move to hoarding, and from hoarding to theft. In this economic fantasy,
the fantasy of the eating of the <I>zeb</I> and the consequent growth
of Mafarka's own penis appears to be based upon the notion that grounds
the fantasy of hoarding: to accumulate it is to increase it. This notion
is, of course, faulty with respect to money, since money must circulate;
as Marx explains, the independence of wealth is "a mere semblance; its
independence of circulation exists only in view of circulation, exists
as dependence on it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Wealth is dependent upon exchange, so that what appears to be, in
 hoarding, an increase in wealth is in fact its decrease. The notion of
 hoarding is foundational to the fantasy of male autarchy in the novel,
 for it proposes to hoard the penis, multiply the stores of virility by
 withdrawing it from the economy of the exchange of women. The economics
 of the fantasy of male autarchy are equally faulty, however, and the
 declaration of the male organ's independence exposes its dependence
 upon women in the (hom[m]o-)sexual economy. Wealth--in this case,
 virility--is, in that economy, dependent upon the exchange of women, upon
 their circulation both as commodities and as the "paper" representatives
 of the phallus. Once women are no longer exchanged, another economy
 must be envisioned. But as we have seen, the narrative can imagine that
 other economy only as the decrease of phallic power; indeed, Mafarka
 describes his years of powerlessness as those years in which he was
 trapped within the uncle's bowels. The narrative starts and stalls at
 each attempt to imagine that economy as ideological closure (here in
 the form of homophobia) moves in to choke it in order to secure the
 value of the phallus. Hoarding thus seems to stand as another (still
 baffling) solution to the dilemma of how to remain heterosexual without
 having sexual relations with women: it is an economy without exchange,
 Midas preferred to Medusa.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This petrified economy of no exchange is also an economy of pillage--there
is take, but no give. It makes (ideological) sense, then, that the
consequence of the

<B></B>

eleven-meter (hoarded) penis should be red as the "rape" of the
king/uncle by his usurping nephew, for the final stage in this series
is an economy of theft and rape. And the same sense might allow us to
suggest that the economy of theft and rape is here not coincidentally
set in Africa, for this is also a colonialist economic fantasy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Outside of the tale within the tale, that economic fantasy appears
in the series of what Kaplan has suggested are "uneven exchanges": as
technological qualities are attributed to humans (largely, males), human
qualities are distributed onto the landscape.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 As we have seen, those human qualities are largely "feminine" ones. But
 what happens to the (female) bodies from which those qualities have
 been borrowed? The novel seems to offer two possibilities, which often
 make up a sequence rather than an alternative: the body becomes the
 bearer of new properties, and/or it is reduced to paste. In the first
 case, the body in question is the black African woman's body, and as
 Liz Constable has noted, the properties in question are those desired
 not so much by an individual male as by a nation:
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 with "sugared thighs, the color of vanilla" and "breasts the color of
 roasted coffee," African women appear "suspended, like bananas, on the
 savory stem of his voice."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Even Magamal, with his "<I>corps de caoutchouc</I>," fits into this
 series. Rubber, sugar, vanilla, coffee, bananas: fantasized colonial
 products become properties of the body to be raped, so that possession
 of the woman becomes possession of the products as well: "One saw the
 smooth and shining bellies of the young women, and their small breasts
 the color of roasted coffee squirm with pain beneath the heavy blows of
 the men, whose bronze loins rose and fell indefatigably, in the dancing
 slapping of green putrefaction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 This rape, which takes place in the green paste produced from the
 grinding of African bodies by a "<I>fantastique pressoir</I>" (fantastic
 press [<I>M</I>, 38]), is, within the terms of the novel, color coded
 racially: the bronze rapists are, like Mafarka, Arabs, while the women
 raped are black Africans.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 And the relation between Arabs and black Africans is, through that
 putrefaction, red as an economic one: "Will not all these piles
 of black corpses, shiny, smoking, and almost liquefied on the dusty
 green of the praires, soon be transformed into pools of liquid manure,
 of rich ebony reflections, to cheer the proprietary eyes of the owner,
 the Sun...and yours, my prime minister!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 What is striking about this passage is not so much its interest in
 putrefaction--Flaubert's fascination, in <I>Salammb&ocirc;</I>, with the
 differing rates of putrefaction of bodies according to their national and
 ethnic identities provides a powerful and perhaps more shocking literary
 precedent--but rather the nature of that interest. Flaubert's investment
 seems detached, almost hyperintellectual, in relation to Mafarka's very
 proprietary interest, which is underlined by the possessive adjectives in
 the passage: the Sun owns the land to be enriched by the rot, the prime
 minister owns the eyes that like those of the Sun are proprietary, and
 Mafarka owns the prime minister. There is indeed a Western perspective
 in the novel, and this perspective is a colonial one. Mafarka the Arab
 is to the black Africans what the white man is to all Africans; the
 position of the subject in the fantasy is found not in this or that
 character, but in the relation between characters (or, as Laplanche
 and Pontalis put it, in the "syntax" of the fantasy).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Putrefaction transforms and transfers properties. Mafarka's interest is
in the future usefuless of such transformations:

The fantasy at work here posits a self-sufficient sun, able to reap crops
without interference of the "natives," indeed, by pur&eacute;eing them
into part of the inanimate raw material necessary in order to produce
those future salads.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 (The culinary, colonial logic of this process brings to mind Helen
 Bannerman's story "Little Black Sambo," in which tigers race after each
 other so fast that they are finally turned into butter, pur&eacute;ed
 into a useful product). A most convenient transformation, for it
 sidesteps all the various problems posed by the very existence
 of "natives," and clears the field for the possibility of the
 self-sufficiency of the Emperor that is the Sun.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 It is here that we may return to the questions with which the
essay began, and posit a point of articulation between the fantasy
of male autarchy as it is played out in <I>Mafarka</I>, and another
fantasy of autarchy that will be played out on the stage of fascist
Italy decades later: that of the cultural autarchy of the nation, and
later of the economic autarchy of the "Impero." I would like to suggest
that these fantasies are interstructuring, intercontaminating. As we
have seen, the fantasy of male autarchy is built upon misogyny, comes
to be threatened with bankruptcy by same-sex relations, and therefore
requires the reintroduction of the other in the form of the woman (to
be raped). Might we also say that the fantasy of national autarchy,
which is built upon nationalist xenophobia, comes to be threatened
with bankruptcy by the erasure of difference within, and therefore also
requires the reintroduction of the other in the form of the colony (to
be raped)? Does the structure of Marinetti's homo(phobic) economics also
inform the structure of fascism's fantasized "home economics"?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 This is the moment of articulation most subject to
narrativizations--source and deltas, roots and branches, biography
and work, and so forth--so I want to be very clear about how I see
the relation between literary text and fascist discourse. I am not
suggesting that proponents of national autarchy, having happened upon
<I>Mafarka</I> one rainy afternoon, found in it a blueprint for their
policies. Nor am I suggesting that Marinetti was possessed of prophetic
powers by means of which he foresaw future policy. I am suggesting,
rather, that both Marinetti's novel and fascist discourse construct
economic and cultural fantasies that share not only individual elements
but an overall structure, a syntax that I have been calling an ideo-logic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In other words, Marinetti did not "act alone." The notion of cultural
fantasy that I invoke here allows us to address ideological structures
as they manifest themselves in and across the most diverse of texts. Just
as the fantasy of male autarchy does not

<B></B>

originate with Marinetti, so the cultural materials that his novel binds
together can be found already joined, at least partially and in varying
conrations, in texts roughly contemporaneous with Marinetti. A case
in point would be an 1898 political tract entitled <I>La virilit&agrave;
nazionale e le colonie italiane</I> (National virility and Italian
colonies) by Pasquale Turiello. National virility and Italian colonies
are, Turiello argues, "completely interdependent, having a mutual relation
of cause and effect."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Turiello spells out that interdependence: Italy has suffered from
 "<I>muliebrit&agrave; politica</I>" (political womanliness) since
 the Risorgimento, a womanliness that consists in a languid weakness
 that has caused the nation to give in too easily to other nations, in
 particular to France, and to have passed up the opportunity to acquire
 colonies. After 1870, Turiello claims, Italy thought of Africa only
 "<I>supinamente</I>" (on her back). Now is the time to begin to
 take "virile action," he announces, and here virility is linked to
 antiparliamentarism, an expanded program of physical education in
 schools, discipline, and demographic colonialism:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To all this [political womanliness] there are only two definitive
remedies: more industrious activity (that in peacetime can only derive
from a more masculine education) and new fields and favor for dignified
emigration, by providing new locations for it. Since we cannot desire
that emigration stop, but rather urge that Italy grow, we are faced
by a dilemma: either this emigration will be entrusted to the changing
conditions of foreign states, so that it goes as a guest with head hung
low, and only as long as others are willing to receive it, or it will
go with head held high to our own lands, open and conquered.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several pages later, Turiello writes, "The solution to the African
problem is still today a problem more of Italian virility than of
Italian finance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 These arguments are similar to those that Mussolini will make. Here I
 cite Turiello in order to point to the way in which the fantasies of
 virility and colonialism that Marinetti's novel elaborates are already
 part of the cultural matrix.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It should not be so surprising, then, to find that two fantasies of
autarchy share an ideological structure. Most vigorous in the 1930s, the
fascist project of cultural autarchy consisted in the effort to expel all
that was foreign--linguistically, literarily, cinematically--in order
that Italian culture might produce itself as authentically Italian and
fascist. The campaign against the <I>Lei</I> (the formal second-person
singular form of address, deemed unItalian because not Latinate),
decrees against the use of words from foreign languages and dialects,
protectionist measures in the cinema as well as the practice of dubbing
all films into Italian, and literary movements like <I>Strapaese</I>
were all "autarchic" measures and proposals. As Giuseppe Carlo Marino
notes, the project remained elusive and dependent upon "a negative norm";
"<I>italianit&agrave;</I>" could define itself only as that which was
not foreign.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 But if the foreign is expelled culturally, it makes a necessary re-entry
 economically. In force during the 1940s, the project of economic
 autarchy aimed to make the nation, and then the Empire, economically
 self-sufficient (this "policy" became something closer to a necessity
 after sanctions were imposed upon Italy as a result of the Ethiopian
 campaign

<B></B>

in 1936). A paradox is produced in the encounter between cultural
imperative and economic reality, for as it turns out, the nation can
only be self-sufficient--can only survive economically--if it depends
upon others, if it annexes new markets and assures itself of sources
of raw materials not available in the metropolis. The paradox is solved
by expanding the "nation" into "empire," for as empire, the nation can
declare itself autarchic by taking into itself the foreign upon which
it depends culturally for definition and economically for survival.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Like the homophobic fantasy of male autarchy, which can do without women
 only through the mediation of women, the xenophobic fantasy of cultural
 and economic autarchy can do without the foreign only by annexing it.

Such an approach is crucial in dealing with fascist discourse which,
as Ernesto Laclau and Alice Yaeger Kaplan have argued, works by binding
together seemingly incompatible elements and polarities; its ideological
specificity therefore lies not in the elements it gathers together but in
the binding mechanism itself. See Ernesto Laclau, "Fascism and Ideology,"

Luce Irigaray, "Commodities Among Themselves," in <I>This Sex Which is

Press, 1985), 193. Originally published as "Des marchandises entre elles,"
<I>La quinzaine litteraire</I> 215 (August 1975). Irigaray's formulation
has been much misunderstood and accused of the very homophobia that
her theory explains. Sedgwick writes that Irigaray's writing about the
hom(m)o-sexual "is the locus classicus" of a trajectory "according to
which authoritarian regimes of homophobic masculinist culture may be
damned on the grounds of being <I>even more homosexual</I> than gay male
culture." Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, <I>The Epistemology of the Closet</I>
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), 154. For other
examples of this reading of Irigaray, see Jonathan Dollimore, <I>Sexual
Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault</I> (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1991) and Joseph Bristow, "Homophobia/Misogyny: Sexual
Fears, Sexual Definitions," in <I>Coming on Strong: Gay Politics and
Culture</I>, ed. Simon Shepherd and Mick Wallis (London: Unwin Hyman,
1989), 64. Dollimore cites Bristow approvingly:

Such an argument gives the impression that gay men are the culprits of
the sexual inequalities--between homosexual and heterosexual, man and
woman--we have to struggle against. The glaring contradiction--that
homosexual desire creates the oppression of homosexuality--appears
over and again in sociology, literary theory and varieties of feminist
criticism. (249-50)

Some of the paradoxes and uneven exchanges that result from this logic
are apparent in a 1940 economic treatise, Raffaele Basile-Giannini's
<I>Autarchia dell'Africa italiana</I> (Rome: Edizioni della "Rassegna
economica dell'Africa italiana," 1940). Published in "Anno XIX" according
to the calendar of the regime, it lays out plans for the autarchy
of Italian Africa as well as for the autarchy of the "Madrepatria,"
or Motherfatherland (another male mother?). The African landscape
it describes is an unpeopled one where colonial products--coffee
from Ethiopia, bananas from Somalia, grain from Libya, livestock
(what the text refers to as the "African zootechnical patrimony"
[109])--stand ready for importation to the Madrepatria. Or rather,
they stand ready to be "contributed" to the autarchy of the empire:
after initially describing the exchanges between colony and nation as
imports and exports, the text switches to "apporto" and "contributo,"
and speaks of "la possibilit&agrave; di eliminazione delle importazioni
metropolitane attraverso l'apporto dell'Africa Italiana" (the possibility
of the elimination of metropolitan imports through the contribution of
Italian Africa). Like the "male ovary," the Italian colony is part of a
one-way deal; part of the empire as it contributes, it is however to be
independent of the nation. Imperial and nationalist rhetorics crisscross,
absorbing and re-expelling the colony as necessary.
