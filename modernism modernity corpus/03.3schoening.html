"It was May of the year 1907, the year that was destined to bring the
greatest number of immigrants to the shores of the United
States."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Thus begins Henry Roth's remarkable novel <I>Call It
Sleep, </I>in which we learn of an eight-year-old Jewish boy from Austria,
David Schearl, attempting to find happiness in a land unfamiliar and often
frightening to him. But if this moment early in the novel suggests that
David's difficulties will derive chiefly from his encounter with an
America hostile to him as an immigrant and a Jew, the rest of the novel
often complicates that idea. Moments after David's story is provisionally
situated within the narrative of early-twentieth-century American
immigration, we are told that when compared with other immigrant families,
there was "something quite untypical" about the Schearls (<I>CS,</I> 11).
We soon learn that their singularity consists in the tension that divides
the family: seeing each other for the first time in years, David's parents
"stood silent, apart; the man staring with aloof, offended eyes grimly
down at the water. . . . And his wife beside him regarding him uneasily,
appealingly. And the child against her breast looking from one to the
other with watchful, frightened eyes" (<I>CS,</I> 11). Here as elsewhere
in the novel, the idea that David's problems will spring from his
experience with a hostile nation is confused by the degree to which the
problems appear instead to emanate from his experience with his family.

<P>
The very suggestion that David's unhappiness might stem from something
other than a clash between two cultures distinguishes


<B></B>


<I>Call It
Sleep </I>from the genre of ethnic novel out of which it grows. Roth began
writing his novel in 1930, just weeks after the immense success of Michael
Gold's <I>Jews Without Money. </I>And as Marcus Klein has pointed out, the
success of Gold's memoir of Jewish life on the Lower East Side of New York
appears to have been crucial to Roth's decision to make his own immigrant
experience central to his literary efforts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Yet the characters
that appear in <I>Jews Without Money </I>are routinely understood to
suffer because the land to which they have come has deprived them of their
cultural or ethnic heritage. Mikey Gold, the young boy at the center of
Gold's narrative, is pointedly made to suffer the humiliation of his
American schoolteachers calling him "Little Kike," and he finds himself
happy only when enveloped by a Lower East Side that he calls "this
remarkable dream of a million Jews."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Giving the young boy the
advice that the novel often offers its imagined audience, Rabbi Samuel
tells Mikey that in the future, he must be mindful of his "tradition," and
that he must "be true to it" (<I>JM,</I> 192). And though the reflective
narrator claims to have found the advice "weird" at the time, he insists
that nevertheless "something deep inside of me responded to it"
(<I>JM,</I> 194).

<P>
<I>Jews Without Money </I>ultimately develops a more complicated account
of its characters' sufferings than this description suggests, and I will
eventually return to the nature of those complications. But it is of more
immediate importance to note that in its assertion of a cultural identity
distinguished from that associated with America, Gold's novel follows the
lead of the Jewish novel of cultural conflict as established most clearly
by Anzia Yezierska's <I>Bread Givers </I>. In Yezierska's novel the
central conflict is between Sara Smolinsky, a young Jew whose desire to
become one of the "real Americans" is so intense that successful
Americanization seems to her the equivalent of being "changed into a
person," and her father, whose embodiment of Jewishness is so absolute
that to his family he seems "an ancient prophet that had just stepped out
of the Bible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 In the course of the novel, Sara's desire to
become an American leads her, against her father's wishes, to refuse an
arranged marriage and to pursue her goal of becoming a public
schoolteacher. But instead of making her happy, Sara's achievements leave
her "empty" (<I>BG,</I> 269), and it is only when she returns to her
father and marries a fellow Jew who is interested in learning the Hebrew
he neglected as a child that Sara is understood to have achieved a kind of
fulfillment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
If <I>Bread Givers</I> or <I>Jews Without Money</I> is representative of
the tradition of the Jewish novel from which <I>Call It Sleep</I> emerges,
we can describe that tradition by saying that within it, the assertion of
a cultural or ancestral identity serves chiefly as a repudiation of
American assimilation. In both <I>Bread Givers</I> and <I>Jews Without
Money,</I> to embrace one's cultural or old-world identity as a Jew is to
reject Americanization. It has recently been argued that the rejection of
assimilation evident in these novels is best understood in relation to an
earlier repudiation of assimilation on the part of mainstream American
cultural agents, notably the modern American novel. Seizing on how novels
as different as <I>The Professor's House</I> , <I>The Great
Gatsby</I> ,


<B></B>


and <I>The Sun Also Rises</I>  imagine
belonging or group membership to be a function of who you are rather than
what you do, Walter Benn Michaels has argued that the American novel of
the 1920s participated in a wide-ranging reconstruction of American
citizenship on the restrictive grounds of identity rather than
behavior.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 As a function of what you do, American citizenship
and identity are available to those who would acquire them by way of
assimilation; as a function of who you are, in some genealogical sense,
they become unavailable to precisely those who could only acquire them in
that way.

<P>
As a number of historians of the period have suggested, the interest that
these novels have in rethinking the terms of American identity derives
from an increasing anxiety in the early 1920s over the numbers of
immigrants arriving on American shores.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In 1924, that anxiety
culminated with the passage of the Johnson Immigration Act, which limited
the number of immigrants allowed into the United States to one hundred and
fifty thousand a year, as opposed to the approximately one million a year
of the period immediately preceding World War I. In a speech to the
National Education Association given soon after the bill passed, Calvin
Coolidge articulated the link between concerns over immigration and
concerns over American identity by citing the Johnson Act as his
administration's chief accomplishment in the effort to help America
"remain American."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Proceeding to inform his audience as to
what they might do to further that project, Coolidge promoted an emphasis
on "the teachings of history" (<I>AN,</I> 37) that would illuminate how
different nations "cling to their customs" (<I>AN,</I> 37), and he
particularly exhorted his audience to make an effort to work themselves
into the past to "search out and think the thoughts of those who
established our institutions" (<I>AN,</I> 56). In Professor St. Peter,
Nick Carraway, and Nick Adams--three fictive Americans clearly drawn to
the past--it is easy to see three res of whom Coolidge would have
approved. And the famous concluding scene of <I>The Great Gatsby,</I> with
its transformation of Nick's eyes into "Dutch sailors' eyes" seeing once
again the "vanished trees" of the "fresh, green breast of the new world,"
is as true to Coolidge's exhortation to recover an original American
experience as one could imagine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
But as novels like <I>Bread Givers</I> and <I>Jews Without Money</I>
suggest, the repudiation of assimilation articulated in the 1920s could be
affirmed by immigrants as well as by "natives"; the project of recovering
and embracing an ancestral past could be undertaken by immigrants like
Sara Smolinsky and Mikey Gold as well as by res like Nick Carraway and
Nick Adams. Indeed, attending to the terms in which the work of immigrant
writers like Yezierska and Gold was often received means recognizing the
degree to which the genre had as one of its central aims the preservation
of an ancestral or cultural experience perceived as endangered precisely
as a result of the assaults of assimilation. In her introduction to
<I>Bread Givers,</I> Alice Kessler Harris observes that the novel takes
great care "to evoke vividly the religion and tradition of the
shtetl."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Similarly, <I>Jews Without Money</I> conforms to the
pattern when it slows to document, in loving detail, what communal
gatherings were like for Jews on the


<B></B>


Lower East Side, recalling
tables laden with such delicacies as "the sponge cake, the herring, the
quince jam, the apples, <I>kraut knishes,</I> fried fish and cheese
blintzes . . . the fiery Polish <I>slivovitz,</I> the <I>wishniak,</I> the
plum brandy, the Roumanian wine" (<I>JM,</I> 21).

<P>
It may have been this aspect of the immigrant or ethnic novel that led a
representative fan of <I>Call It Sleep</I> like Leslie Fiedler to describe
that novel as the best example we have in American literature of an
immigrant "caught between two cultures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 But as I have
suggested, <I>Call It Sleep</I> resists being understood in terms of the
model of cultural conflict developed in so many of the novels from which
it draws. Its resistance is first registered in those scenes where David's
suffering is understood to derive less from his experiences with a hostile
nation and more from his experiences with a divided family. Very early in
the narrative, we are invited to consider the obvious tension between
David's parents to be his greatest problem, a consideration that quickly
acquires force in a scene in which David's father beats him while the boy
cries out, "Please, papa! Please! No more! No more! Darling papa! Darling
papa!" (<I>CS,</I> 84). In <I>Jews Without Money,</I> the family is
routinely understood as a cultural refuge that the immigrant can seek when
assaulted by the new world and its hostile culture. In <I>Call It
Sleep,</I> the family is itself one of the most powerful sources of the
immigrant's suffering, and David is depicted less as a child caught
between two cultures than between two parents.

<P>
And yet it would not be entirely accurate to say that <I>Call It Sleep</I>
traces its hero's sufferings to his family rather than to his experiences
with a world beyond it; David repeatedly suffers from experiences that
originate outside of his family, and that ultimately have nothing to do
with his mother or father. One of the first and most memorable of these is
his experience with a young immigrant girl who initiates him into the
mysteries of sex: wishing to play along while Annie outlines a new game,
David agrees to "play bad" until he discovers that this means sliding his
hand under her dress to feel "her skin under his palm" (<I>CS,</I> 53).
Horrified, he flees, and for the rest of the novel he expends a good deal
of energy trying to suppress the memory of an experience that threatens to
overwhelm him, to reduce the world to "a thousand little pieces, all
buzzing, all whining, and no one hearing them and no one seeing them
except himself" (<I>CS,</I> 55).

<P>
Annie, however, is only the beginning; throughout Roth's novel, David has
experiences that originate outside of his family, and that occasion in him
the same kind of suffering. In this light, it is more accurate to say that
David's difficulties are traced to a hostile environment that includes,
but extends beyond, his family. This links <I>Call It Sleep</I> even more
closely to <I>Jews Without Money,</I> to the distinct variation that that
novel works on the immigrant drama of cultural identity central to a novel
like <I>Bread Givers.</I> That is, immigrants in <I>Jews Without Money</I>
suffer because they have been both culturally and <I>economically</I>
deprived. The mindless cruelty of the young boys at the center of Gold's
narrative is repeatedly seen to derive from the boys' detachment from
their ethnic past, <I>and</I> from the degree to which they have been
forced to live in a slum world of "violence and stone," a place where
there are "too many cats"


<B></B>


and "too many children" (<I>JM,</I> 63). At
such moments, <I>Jews Without Money</I> develops a distinctly class-based
argument that accompanies its cultural argument concerning the suffering
of its protagonists. And insofar as David's world in <I>Call It Sleep</I>
is indeed the ghetto outlined in <I>Jews Without Money,</I> Roth's novel
extends the line of argument found in Gold's novel to suggest that its
hero is caught not simply between two cultures, or even between two
parents, but most crucially between two classes, the rich and the poor.

<P>
Just such a reading accounts for the other major avenue by which <I>Call
It Sleep</I> has come to be appreciated. In addition to being lauded as a
novel of culture that captures "Jewish life," Roth's work is routinely
praised as a narrative of class that captures what it means for a young
boy to be "exposed, shock by shock, to the blows of slum
life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 And yet here too <I>Call It Sleep</I> resists the
models of understanding that so clearly apply to other novels in the
tradition of immigrant fiction from which it draws. In <I>Jews Without
Money,</I> the suffering of young children is routinely understood as
occasioned by experiences highly specific to ghetto life; young girls, for
example, are forced by the need for money and the absence of economic
opportunity into prostitution (<I>JM,</I> 31). In <I>Call It Sleep,</I>
however, David's sufferings are traced to experiences difficult to call
ghetto-specific. Early in the novel, for instance, David encounters a
funeral while on his way home from school. Realizing what he is seeing, he
is reduced to a familiar "sense of desolation" (<I>CS,</I> 61). While
there is little doubt here that David lives in a ghetto and that he
suffers, funerals occur outside ghettos as well as inside them; they are
not specific to ghetto life.

<P>
How, then, are we to understand the desolation from which David suffers?
Or, more immediately, how does the novel understand this desolation to
resist narratives of cultural, familial, and economic deprivation? David's
encounter with the funeral leads to an exchange with his mother in which,
in response to her asking him what is wrong, he replies quietly, "I don't
know" (<I>CS,</I> 62). He wonders about a "dreamlike fugitive sadness"
that possesses him; he is haunted by visions of a world, a standard by
which everything in the actual world is found either wanting or assaultive
(<I>CS,</I> 68). Later, after another experience in which he has been
reduced to his familiar despair, David identifies this utopianism as the
source of his suffering. "Just don't believe," he counsels himself,
attempting to suppress his tendency to see a world other than the one that
confronts him; "don't believe, never" (<I>CS,</I> 116). "But," he goes on
to wonder, "when would that queer weight, that odd something lodged in his
bosom, that was so spiny, ramified, reminding, when would that vanish?
Tomorrow, maybe? Maybe tomorrow" (<I>CS,</I> 116). Here, as at other
moments, David's suffering is imagined to stem from some obscure and inner
sense he has of how the world might otherwise be, a "fugitive" sense that
the world he inhabits offends at every turn. And here, as elsewhere, David
imagines that if he could escape that sense, he might escape the cycle of
hope and despair that his experience has become.

<P>
Throughout <I>Call It Sleep,</I> though, that hope is positioned beyond
realization, and it is precisely this fact that accounts for David's
failure not only to be like the other boys in the street, but to become an
American. The other immigrant children who


<B></B>


appear are routinely
presented as enthusiastic students of the new world into which they have
been thrown; they study how to make their way in it, and in the process
become "this new breed[:] . . . Americans" (<I>CS,</I> 374). By contrast,
David is indifferent. Early in the novel, a boy in his neighborhood finds
an abandoned clock on the street. He dismantles it to recover a cog that
resembles a coin, and that thus might be used in a "slod machine" to get
gum (<I>CS,</I> 21). When he invites David to join him in retrieving the
prize, David's indifference causes the boy to eye him "curiously," and
after "shrugging off his perplexity," he leaves David alone (<I>CS,</I>
22). Because his mind is tuned to the fugitive sense of an alternative
world he carries about with him, David is construed as fundamentally
indifferent, and that indifference is understood to keep him from becoming
Americanized.

<P>
Eventually, and perhaps inevitably, David's indifference is identified by
the neighborhood rabbi as a sign of his true Jewishness, since it is taken
as a sign of his resistance to the forces of assimilation destroying
"Yiddish youth" (<I>CS,</I> 374). But it is important to note the way in
which Roth's novel goes out of its way to resist this view of David's
behavior. Readers of <I>Call It Sleep</I> will recall the extreme degree
to which David is understood to be his mother's rather than his father's
son: the young boy's nature is his mother's, not his father's, and there
is actually some question early in the narrative as to who his actual
biological father is. The other candidate is the "goy" (<I>CS,</I> 196)
Genya met and fell in love with in Austria, and though the situation is
eventually clarified, the force of the story depends less upon whether it
changes David's actual parentage than on the way it illuminates the son's
nature by way of revealing the mother's.

<P>
In the story in question, Genya is revealed to have been a romantic and an
idealist--therefore a problematic Jew. In pursuing her instinctive sense
of love and what marriage might be, as opposed to the more traditional
sense conveyed to her by her parents, Genya finds herself in love with a
Christian; thus, at the very moment she is understood to have satisfied
her basic nature, she is understood as a fallen Jew. As the less
idealistic sister, Bertha explicates the position of the Jewish community
on this question, "even if he was educated . . . and even if he was an
organist, he was a goy!" (<I>CS,</I> 196). At this and other points in
Roth's novel, Genya is clearly understood to be an idealist, responsive
less to the world as she finds it than to the world as she imagines it.
And at this and other points her idealism is understood to complicate, not
complement, her status as a Jew.

<P>
David's situation is rendered similarly: like his mother, he is less
responsive to the world he finds than to some alternative world he senses.
And like his mother, David undergoes an experience in which he discovers
he is a fallen Jew at precisely the moment he most satisfies his nature.
Late in the novel David meets a young Polish immigrant, a Christian, named
Leo. Because Leo's description of Christ evokes for David the image of an
even more powerful agent of world reconstruction than the Hebrew God he
has heard about in cheder, David instinctively asks the boy for the
scapular hanging around his neck. At this moment David vaguely recognizes
that his act involves "betraying all the Jews in his house" (<I>CS,</I>
306). But the desire that animates


<B></B>


his act--the desire to bring into
being a world other than the one that exists--is sufficiently strong to
override that concern. David is as idealistic as his mother, and again
that idealism is understood to make David a problematic Jew.

<P>
The novel's resistance to interpreting idealism as a sign of Jewishness is
nowhere more clearly dramatized than in the rabbi's repeatedly emphasized
misunderstanding of David's interest in his studies at cheder. While
David's proficiency in Hebrew studies is understood by his rabbi to
indicate a profound and rare interest in discovering "what it means to be
a Jew" (<I>CS,</I> 210), it is repeatedly construed as a function of the
quite different desire to learn about, and make contact with, a power
capable of first destroying and then refashioning the world. The Jewish
lore that the rabbi understands David to seek as an end in itself is, in
other words, routinely presented merely as a means to an end, an end the
boy clearly articulates when he asks his mother whether the God he has
heard of in cheder is capable of "breaking up" the world (<I>CS,</I> 241).
To the rabbi, then, David's indifference to the world around him is a sign
of his Jewishness, a sign of his resistance to the process of assimilation
that is "Americanization." But to the novel, that indifference is
understood to make David a failed or problematic Jew, as well as a failed
American.

<P>
To observe that David and his mother are both understood to be failed
Americans as well as problematic Jews is to note the degree to which
<I>Call It Sleep</I> rejects the opposition between American and Jew so
central to texts of the 1920s as different as <I>Bread Givers</I> and
Willa Cather's <I>The Professor's House.</I> In <I>Call It Sleep</I> that
opposition is converted into something like an identity, for Jews and
Americans are vaguely identified in terms of being able to accept and
adapt to the world in a way that neither Genya nor David can manage. In
entertaining a link between the identities of Jews and Americans, <I>Call
It Sleep</I> is following another lead established by <I>Jews Without
Money</I> in adapting another variation on the tradition of the immigrant
novel to which <I>Bread Givers</I> belongs. For in Gold's novel, true Jews
are understood to be true Americans, on the grounds that like true
Americans, true Jews are hard-working and adaptive. The qualification
"true" that precedes both "Jews" and "Americans" in this description is
important, because Gold's narrative is populated with false Jews as well
as false Americans, and sorting out the difference is vital to the work of
the novel.

<P>
Early in Gold's novel a distinction is established between the Americans
whom immigrants confront and the America that the Founding Fathers
imagined. The immigrants are confronted by Americans who are lazy,
overfed, and exploitative. The Founding Fathers, on the other hand, are
understood to have been hard-working individualists trying to make a place
for others like themselves. The immigrants in the novel can thus maintain
the paradoxical position of blasting contemporary America while becoming
emotional when at one point young Mikey sings:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">
[<I>JM,</I> 120].

<P>
<B></B>

<P>
Similarly, a distinction is drawn between true and false Jews, with the
former understood as hard-working and resourceful, while the latter are
seen as overprivileged and lazy. Mikey's mother, who holds several jobs
while caring for the sick in her building, is thus dramatically contrasted
with the overfed and discontented wife of a Jewish businessman, who is
described as "a typical wife of a Jewish <I>nouveau riche</I>" (<I>JM,</I>
217).

<P>
The identification of true Jews with true Americans that <I>Jews Without
Money</I> posits is most neatly articulated by Mikey's elision of Buffalo
Bill with the messiah. Having roamed outside of his neighborhood and into
the province of Italian boys hostile to Jews, Mikey imagines that

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
it was like the Wild West. Under the fierce sky Buffalo Bill and I chased
buffalo over the vast plains. . . . Then a secret message was sent to us
from a beautiful white maiden. She was a prisoner in the camp of the
Indians. . . . Buffalo Bill and I rode and rode and rode. In the nick of
time we saved her. . . . We escaped with the white girl, and rode and rode
and rode. . . . [<I>JM,</I> 187]
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As a Jew surrounded by hostile elements, young Mikey imagines himself as
allied with Buffalo Bill: both are rugged individualists, and both are
underdogs instinctively opposed to oppression.

<P>
In linking Jews and Americans <I>Jews Without Money</I> depends upon a
shift in how both forms of identity are conceived. For if Jewish and
American identities are conceived in terms of an ancestral past, as they
are in texts such as <I>Bread Givers</I> and <I>The Professor's House,</I>
then Jews cannot be Americans and Americans cannot be Jews, for the pasts
they are understood to possess are clearly different. In order for the
link to be made, the identities in question must be grounded differently.
The shift in question involves a move away from the idea of shared
ancestry or culture, and toward the idea of a shared disposition or
psychology. For what enables the identification of Mikey with Buffalo Bill
is a shared psychology: a sense of independence and resourcefulness in the
face of perceived difficulty. Their pasts have nothing in common. The
terms by which the Jew and the American are here identified indicate not
only the emergence of new conceptions of American citizenship and theories
of national identity in the 1930s, but also the particular concerns that
ground this shift.

<P>
In 1925 Maxwell Telling, an educator and self-declared patriot, announced
that those concerned with the future of America should take time to
understand not their culture but their psychology, not the experiences of
their ancestors but "the psychological experience of their
children."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Telling's argument was based on the premise that
the challenge facing America was not immigration, as Coolidge and others
had suggested, but economic progress. For Telling, World War I had
accelerated the national economy to the point that it was in danger of
exhausting those who would consume its products. The study to which
Telling's remarks served as an introduction, <I>Childhood's Fears:
Psychoanalysis and the Inferiority-Fear Complex</I> , went on



<B></B>


to argue that fear was the privileged experience in relation to which
parents must now raise their children; its presence or absence would
determine whether a child would become an "extrovert" or an "introvert,"
that is to say, an individual capable of embracing and adapting to the
world around him, or an individual paralyzed by that world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

For Telling and G. F. Morton, the author of the study, resourcefulness or
adaptability was the hallmark of a healthy human being <I>and a good
citizen,</I> and parents were urged to take special care to promote those
qualities in their children at a time when, as Morton put it, "material
civilization is going ahead so swiftly that man seems to be losing control
of the machinery owing to his own relatively slower advance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P>
The displacement of culture by psychology in the nationalist discourse
represented by Telling and Morton turns upon the displacement of racial or
ethnic concerns by concerns more specifically economic. The distinction
invoked here between culture and psychology, race and economics, is
complicated. It is arguable that the race-thinking of the 1920s in America
and other nations is economically motivated, and that the concern with
"culture" evident in that period is no less an economic issue than
depression unemployment. Moreover, it is arguable that the concern with
adaptability that marks the 1930s is racially inflected (John Steinbeck's
<I>The Grapes of Wrath</I> would be a case in point), and that the
psychological discourse emergent in the decade is thus less distinct from
the cultural exclusions of the 1920s than might appear. From this
perspective, it seems well advised to take account of the strategic
rhetorical nature of the distinction between culture and psychology or
race and economics invoked by Telling and others. And indeed, to do so is
to focus even more directly on the quite real effects that such
distinctions produced in American narratives.

<P>
From this vantage point, while culture became definitive grounds for
American citizenship and identity when the challenge facing the nation was
perceived to be racial or ethnic, psychology emerged as a basis for these
things when the nation confronted a more specifically economic challenge.
We would then expect to find the kind of nationalist discourse represented
by Telling and Morton becoming more prominent than that represented by
Coolidge in situations where economic concerns were perceived to outweigh,
or at least compete with, racial and ethnic concerns. No moment in
American history exemplifies such a situation better than the depression
of the 1930s, and it is in fact in the context of the Great Depression and
its emergent concerns that one can begin to grasp the force of the
identification between Jew and American that distinguishes a text like
<I>Jews Without Money.</I>

<P>
The Great Depression was only getting underway when <I>Jews Without
Money</I> was published, but Michael Gold had long viewed America and its
concerns in economic terms. As a founding editor of <I>The New Masses,</I>
Gold was interested in elaborating a new critique of contemporary America,
and in <I>Jews Without Money</I> it becomes clear that the kind of
nationalist discourse practiced by Morton and Telling in many ways opened
the door for him.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 To a re like Gold, the initial appeal
of the discourse


<B></B>


of disposition and psychology lay in its rejection
of the criteria that prevented all immigrants and most workers from
considering themselves central to the nation. And insofar as this
discourse insisted instead upon the centrality of a proper psychological
disposition, immigrants and workers became as likely to be "true
Americans" as the owners and natives with whom they were typically
contrasted.

<P>
Moreover, in its particular insistence upon the virtues of resourcefulness
and adaptability, the discourse in question allowed Gold to suggest that
the experience of immigrants and workers made them in fact <I>more</I>
likely to be true Americans than the natives or owners. In his
introduction to <I>Jews Without Money,</I> Gold attacks Nazi rhetoric as
it had begun to take hold in Weimar Germany--not on the grounds that it
was wrong to blame capitalists and "international bankers" for
contemporary social ills, but because it had mistakenly identified Jews
with these capitalists. "The great mass of Jews in the world today," Gold
argued vehemently, "are not millionaire bankers, but paupers and workers"
(<I>JM,</I> 6). As "paupers and workers," Jews in Gold's novel possess
precisely the virtues of resourcefulness and adaptability that Telling and
Morton use to identify their true patriots. And in the course of the
narrative, Jewish immigrants are thus imagined to be not just part of an
America from which they had previously been excluded, but the very heart
of the nation, in that they are conceived to possess precisely the
originary qualities needed to rejuvenate a crippled economy.

<P>
Public interest in ghetto experience, which was quite small during the
1920s, exploded during the depression, as several historians have
suggested; this accounts in large part for the astonishing success of
novels of hardship like <I>Jews Without Money,</I> James T. Farrell's
<I>Studs Lonigan</I> , and <I>The Grapes of Wrath</I>
.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 From this perspective, it seems clear why <I>Call It
Sleep</I> follows <I>Jews Without Money</I> in collapsing the opposition
between Jew and American so central to so many novels of the 1920s. Begun
in 1930 and published four years later, Roth's novel simply assumes that
the experience of becoming an American should be understood as a
psychological drama rather than engaged as a cultural drama of
assimilation. The failure in <I>Call It Sleep</I> of David and his mother
to be simultaneously Americans and Jews is understood as deriving
precisely from their failure to adapt to the world into which they have
been thrown.

<P>
And yet, although <I>Call It Sleep</I> follows <I>Jews Without Money</I>
in rejecting the opposition between Jew and American, it diverges from the
path of Gold's novel by marginalizing precisely those res who do adapt
to and overcome the hardships with which they are presented. In contrast
to Mikey's mother, David's mother is never employed outside the home, and
creates for herself and her son an environment defined expressly by the
absence of those challenges that mark the world beyond their apartment
door. And in contrast to Mikey, David avoids the world. Roth's novel,
then, precisely <I>reverses</I> the terms of Gold's novel, celebrating
exactly the psychological proclivities Gold identifies as at once
anti-American and anti-Jewish. I will eventually argue that in doing so
<I>Call It Sleep</I> employs the high-modern ration of the irreducibly
alienated subject to construct, within a depression-era cultural discourse
in


<B></B>


which Americanness was increasingly a matter of resourcefulness,
an alternative to the idea that good Americans were defined by the
flexibility with which they responded to the hardships of the depression.
At present, since the reversal that Roth's novel effects is conducted in
terms of the novel's celebration of David, the meaning of that reversal is
best grasped by examining the nature of that celebration.

<P>
Throughout the novel, David is distinguished from other immigrant children
not only by his revulsion to the world as he finds it, but by the degree
to which his mind is constantly engaged in the business of considering and
reconsidering the elements of experience. At home or wandering the
streets, David is imagined to be "sifting the mind's trinkets": "Was
wondering. Birds? Not birds. Bad words? No. Before that. When? Aunt
Bertha, the new man? No. Can't find. Funny. Maybe his name? Mr.--Mr. What.
Yes. Maybe. No--But . . ." (<I>CS,</I> 174). The content of the sifting
represented here--David is mulling over the pieces of the puzzle that is
his mother's past--is less important than the degree to which David is
identified throughout the novel with this kind of mental activity, for in
that identification lies the novel's most privileged understanding of its
young hero. Insofar as he is possessed by an "odd something" (<I>CS,</I>
116) that makes him less responsive to the external world than to an
internal one, David is imagined, like his mother, to be an idealist.
Insofar as he also possesses a desire to take in hand the disparate
aspects of his experience and to refashion them in accordance with that
other world, David is also understood to be an artist, and <I>Call It
Sleep</I> reemerges as a portrait of the artist as a young man.

<P>
Readers of <I>Call It Sleep</I> have long observed affinities between
Roth's work and Joyce's, and Roth himself identified Joyce as one of the
most powerful models behind <I>Call It Sleep.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The
techniques used to represent the workings of David's mind are clearly
indebted to techniques employed in <I>Ulysses</I> , and the
concluding scene of Roth's novel, where narrative techniques give way to
theatrical conventions, is obviously indebted to the Nighttown episode of
Joyce's novel. And yet, in addition to these affinities, there is the less
often remarked matter of David's resemblance to the image of the modern
artist that a novel like <I>Ulysses</I> projects. That image, which <I>The
Waste Land</I> could also be understood to project, is that of a man
sifting through the detritus of the world to see whether it might be
refashioned under the sign of some coherence or redemption. In a
discussion of Joyce, Eliot, and modernism, Roth claimed that
<I>Ulysses,</I> like <I>The Waste Land,</I> had shown him that "literature
[could] be created out of junk."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 And insofar as the young boy
at the center of <I>Call It Sleep</I> is distinguished by his tendency to
sift through "the trinkets of his mind" with an eye to coherence and
redemption--insofar as he is distinguished by precisely the tendency
associated with artistry in the work of Joyce and Eliot--the novel not
only paints a portrait of the artist as a young man, but paints a quite
specific portrait of the <I>modern</I> artist as a young man.

<P>
This tracing of literary influences brings to light the double, and
conflicted, genealogy of <I>Call It Sleep.</I> On the one hand it is
clearly indebted to the tradition of the immigrant novel represented by
<I>Bread Givers</I> and <I>Jews Without Money;</I> on the


<B></B>


other hand
the novel is just as clearly indebted to the modernism represented by
<I>Ulysses</I> and <I>The Waste Land.</I> The tradition of modernism
represented by Joyce and Eliot is often understood to have assumed as its
normative perspective the position of a subject with distinct privileges
of class and culture, privileges that at times revealed themselves in
moments of explicit anti-Semitism (think of Eliot's "Gerontion"). By
contrast, the tradition of the immigrant novel is often understood to have
assumed as its normative perspective the position of a subject deprived of
precisely the privileges that Eliot's modernism assumes. Moreover, in
adopting this latter perspective, the immigrant or ethnic novel is
frequently understood to entail a progressive politics that would insist
on including in public discourse precisely the voices that Eliot's
modernism excludes. To write a novel of immigrant experience in the
tradition of Yezierska and Gold is in this sense a politically progressive
act, although fashioning that work according to some of the central tenets
of what we have come to call high modernism might seem to defeat, or at
least complicate, that very purpose.

<P>
The novel's involvement with modernism is manifest in its concluding
scene, in which David stumbles toward an electrified streetcar rail, iron
milk ladle in hand, intending to draw from the rail the sparks he
understands to confirm the existence of a divine being possessed of
reconstructive powers. In addition to suggesting that David is driven to
this act by the "queer weight" (<I>CS,</I> 116) that distinguishes him
from others in the novel, the scene unfolds by juxtaposing David's
thoughts with the speech of various characters who inhabit the murky world
through which he moves, producing an effect similar to that achieved in
the Nighttown episode of <I>Ulysses,</I> or to the polyvocal pastiche of
<I>The Waste Land.</I> In a typical speech, a laborer named O'Toole
delivers himself as follows:

<P>

<P>
In one sense, Roth's readers have been right to focus on the affinities
between Roth's work and that of Joyce or Eliot. But to restrict the
critical attention to the narrative's formal features--especially in the
presence of speeches like O'Toole's--is to ignore the suddenly heightened
vulgarity of the characters whose actions are juxtaposed to David's.
Indeed, speeches like O'Toole's are suddenly offered toward the end of the
novel in order to display the degree to which the inhabitants of the
ghetto in which David finds himself have been degraded by the conditions
in which they are forced to live.


<B></B>

<P>
For most of its nearly five hundred pages, <I>Call It Sleep</I> has seemed
far less concerned than <I>Jews Without Money</I> and other novels of its
kind to focus on the nightmarish aspects of the ghetto that its
protagonist inhabits. I have suggested that this derives from the novel's
resistance to reducing its hero's sufferings to membership in a particular
class. In its final pages, however, Roth's narrative presents the ghetto
in as unflattering a light as any depicted in other immigrant novels, and
David's flight to the rail is clearly seen as deriving less from an
idiosyncratic nature than from the direct effects of his surroundings,
which he has perceived more acutely than anyone else. Moreover, the
novel's desire to suggest that the condition of the people it depicts
derives from a systematic problem with the nation to which they have come
is made explicit by a voice that is raised above the din to exclaim, "And
do you know, you can go all the way up inside her for twenty-five cents.
For only twenty-five cents, mind you! Every American man, woman and child
ought to go up inside her, it's a thrilling experience. The statue of
liberty is--" (<I>CS,</I> 415).

<P>
The statue of liberty appears here as defiled and defiling, and the nation
that the statue represents appears as degraded and degrading. In this
moment <I>Call It Sleep</I> establishes an explicitly national context for
David's actions. Or, to put this point differently, in this moment <I>Call
It Sleep</I> brings together its modernism and its politics. Indeed,
Roth's novel invites us here to understand David's drive to the rail in
the context of a critique of America that calls for revolution on the
grounds that the nation has arrived at the point of systematically
betraying the promises made to its citizens. In case there is any
possibility of missing this, we are given the final words that float
through David's mind the moment before he hits the rail: "Machine!
Liberty! Revolt! Redeem!" (<I>CS,</I> 419) And in case we are inclined to
miss that moment's significance, it becomes manifest in the description of
the consequences of David's act. As he hits the rail we are told that all
around him "a long burst of flame spurted from underground, growled as if
the veil of the earth were splitting" (<I>CS,</I> 420). The apocalyptic
tone of this passage is unmistakable, and its revolutionary impact is
extended once we recognize that, in addition to producing the sparks that
he associates with divine presence, David has interrupted at this moment
the electrical power flowing to, and sustaining, the routinized world of
the immigrant laborers around him. At the moment he does so the laborers
turn toward him--they snap out of the haze in which they exist--to
experience a moment of unusual and possibly significant reflection. "The
masses," we are told, "stood suddenly mute a moment, for a moment silent,
stricken, huddled, crushed by the pounce of night" (<I>CS,</I> 422).

<P>
We are to understand that it is precisely David's inability to adapt
himself to any aspect of the world that has led to this potentially
transformative moment. Throughout <I>Call It Sleep,</I> David has been
differentiated from others in terms of that inability. It now becomes
clear that the capacity to find one's way in the world is an obstacle, not
an avenue, to meaningful change. The workers surrounding David are
immigrant boys grown up, immigrants whose adaptation to the world has
resulted in finding places within it. But their social niches have
violated, not secured, their interests. By contrast, David's
<I>inability</I> to accommodate himself to the world is
understood


<B></B>


 at
the end of the novel to have brought him to the point of ring in the
genuinely revolutionary possibility of redirecting a power currently
engaged in sustaining the world to secure that world's destruction.

<P>
This is to suggest that, in the end, Roth's novel appropriates the
modernist celebration of the alienated subject and turns it not to
conservative or apolitical ends, but to distinctly progressive, even
radical, ones. The final scene of <I>Call It Sleep</I> employs the
high-modern ration of the irreducibly alienated subject in order at
once to <I>engage</I> a depression-era cultural discourse in which
Americanness was increasingly understood as a matter of adaptation, and to
construct <I>within that discourse</I> an alternative to the idea that
good Americans were defined by the skill and resourcefulness with which
they responded to economic hardships. In <I>Jews Without Money,</I>
adaptation is seized upon as a criterion for Americanness because it is
understood to allow for the inclusion of those subjects--immigrants and
ethnics--previously excluded from mainstream American discourse;
adaptation is understood to constitute the basis of a progressive
politics. In <I>The Grapes of Wrath</I> and other depression-era novels of
its kind, the same criterion is embraced because it can include the poor
in American discourse, and is similarly capable of inaugurating a
revolutionary movement. In <I>Call It Sleep,</I> however, adaptation is
rejected as a form of insidious incorporation; paralysis is embraced as a
precipatory form of extreme alienation that can trigger the coming into
being of a nation genuinely receptive to its citizen's concerns.

<P>
We can see, then, how Roth's text imagines the two traditions from which
it draws, high modernism and the novel of immigrant experience, to
complement each other. Indeed, Roth's novel imagines the modernist
celebration of the irreducibly alienated subject--the subject alienated,
in this case, expressly beyond the available therapeutics of cultural or
class identification--as constituting an extension of precisely the kind
of politics widely associated in the period with the embrace of classed,
raced, or cultured subjects. <I>Call It Sleep</I> resists narrative
patterns that locate David's suffering in his alienation from his culture
or class. And we have seen, when considering the degree to which David is
defined in the novel in terms of his sifting mind, how this resistance is
bound up with the novel's interest in rendering David as an artist. Yet
while David is thus presented as an artist rather than as a "Jew" or a
"worker"--while David's experience and suffering are thus presented in
precisely the way that an identification of him as a Jew or a worker would
resist--this characteristic is understood to make David more rather than
less politically progressive. Precisely insofar as he is understood as
resistant to the available identifications of ethnicity and class, David
is red as an agent of revolutionary change.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P>
The logic of <I>Call It Sleep</I> raises a number of concluding questions,
the first of which concerns the novel's judgment of the relationship
between a certain kind of modernism and a particular kind of radicalism.
Indeed, the celebration of resistance or paralysis evident in <I>Call It
Sleep</I> speaks to ongoing debates about the political value of
resistance or oppositionalism <I>as such</I> that increasingly animate
contemporary arguments about the kinds of cultural work that have a right
to be called progressive, and the kinds that don't.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 From one
of the two perspectives that dominate this


<B></B>


debate, the resistance
to identification celebrated in <I>Call It Sleep</I> represents an evasion
of the world of social and political affairs. Such resistance is seen as
an evasion of the sphere of "interests" with which the world of social and
political affairs is identified.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 From the other perspective,
the resistance in question is the basis of any genuine indictment of the
world; a resistance to accepting interests formulated in, and thus
complicit with, the world is taken to indicate a genuine opposition to the
current order of things.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P>
The dispute thus turns upon different theories of transformation or
change, and upon the place assigned within those theories to ideas of
exteriority or totality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 And although it is not within the
scope of this essay to resolve this debate, a concluding observation
regarding it is in order. In recovering the claim put forward in <I>Call
It Sleep</I> concerning the political ambiguity of certain cultural or
class identifications in the 1930s, we encounter the limits of what may be
called a political formalism, in which the social or political import of
certain commitments is understood to have been established at the level of
theory, and is thus independent of any of the particular social fields in
which those commitments might operate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In the absence, for
example, of recovering the specific fields of identification in which
<I>Call It Sleep</I> elaborates its commitment to a kind of high modern
alienation, Roth's novel would be, and indeed has been understood as
profoundly conservative on the grounds that the politically reactionary
nature of disidentification has been conceptually established. And yet to
recover the specific understandings of the Jew and the worker that Roth's
narrative resists is to find--or so I hope to have shown--that its
commitment to refusing such identifications cannot be so easily
understood. Indeed Roth's novel, and the recovery of its original context,
provides a provocative argument for the desirability of revisiting the
grounds upon which a number of political judgments have been made about a
number of literary works and periods.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 And finally, with
respect to the question of what kinds of cultural work have a right to be
called progressive, <I>Call It Sleep,</I> and, hopefully, the analysis
conducted here suggests that the best answers we can give to those
questions will be discovered at the level of what we might call sociality
as distinct from theory.

Ibid., 215. Since Telling and Morton's text weighs so heavily in
myargument for a shift in American discourse from race to psychology, and
from culture to economics, I want to be explicit about the degree to which
it is representative. My central claim for its representativeness rests on
a particular difference between a novel like <I>Bread Givers</I> and a
novel like <I>Jews Without Money</I> with respect to the narrative of
becoming (or failing to become) an American. The difference is between a
narrative in which ancestry is central to the question of Americanization,
and a narrative in which resilience is central to that question. Moreover,
Morton's book is part of a genealogy of contemporaneous studies that
entertain, with varying degrees of explicitness, the hypothesis that the
future of the nation has more to do with psychology than race, given that
its concerns would soon be more economic than cultural. For instance, in
their preface to H. von Hug-Hellmuth's <I>A Study of the Mental Life of
the Child,</I> trans. James J. Putnam (Washington: Nervous and Mental
Disease Publishing Company, 1919), James J. Putnam and Mabel Stevens argue
that since adulthood is nothing but "an extension of childhood," the key
to an individual's future lay in his or her "mental life" rather than in
his or her ancestry or genetic makeup (viii). By 1925, Morton and Telling
are in a position to shape this premise into the more specific argument
that, since nations depend upon the adults that run them, and since the
psychological traits of adaptability and resilience may be increasingly
demanded of adults, the key to the national future might lie in
cultivating these particular traits in children. And by 1930 this line of
argument is sufficiently established to allow Willard C. Olson, in
<I>Problem Tendencies in Children</I> (Minneapolis: University of
Minnesota Press, 1930), to state quite simply that an indifference to
"environmental demands" constitutes a "behavior problem" ; and to allow
Samuel Hartwell, in <I>Fifty-Five Bad Boys</I> (New York: Knopf, 1931), to
explain that the term "bad boy" signifies "a maladjusted boy," and that
now there was no more important task than intervening in the lives of such
bad boys in order to "modify the behavior and emotional habit patterns of
children in the direction of normal and healthy reactions" .

One point raised by the description of <I>Call It Sleep</I> advancedhere
bears remarking upon. Roth's joining the Communist Party of the
United States in 1933 might indicate an embrace of precisely the class
identification that I am claiming the novel resists. Roth's membership,
however, is profitably contrasted to Gold's. Like most party members, Gold
appears to have joined the CPUSA because he was committed to reorganizing
America in the interests of workers, and because he understood the party
to be the best means to that end. In the wake of problematic events like
the Moscow Trials and the Nazi-Soviet Pact, Gold was capable of critiquing
the party, and at times of distancing himself from it when it disengaged
from the interests to which he was committed. For a concise account of
Gold's dealings with the CPUSA, see Michael Folsom, introduction to
<I>Mike Gold: A Literary Anthology,</I> ed. Michael Folsom (New York:
International, 1972), 7-20. Roth, by contrast, appears to have turned
to the party out of a disaffection more general than the economic
disaffection that animated Gold. The very events that would qualify the
loyalty of party members like Gold left Roth unruffled; when pressed, Roth
would explain his allegiance by insisting that it was finally "the product
more of intuition than analysis" (Henry Roth, "Where My Sympathy Lies,"
<I>The New Masses,</I> 2 March 1937, 9). The nature of the "intuition" in
question can be recovered by recalling the most immediate thing the CPUSA
could be said to have represented at the time Roth joined: a fundamental
opposition to everything that America had historically been to that point.
To recall this fact is to recognize the degree to which Roth's turn to the
party was animated less by his commitment to the interests of a particular
<I>class</I> than by his commitment to rejecting--in the most fundamental
way possible--the nation he inhabited. We can then begin to understand not
only the peculiar logic behind Roth's vexing history with the CPUSA, but
the logic by which he comes to understand modernist alienation as an
<I>extension</I> of political opposition.

For a concise introduction to the kind of debates referred to here,and
for an indication of the degree to which they tend to revolve around
"postmodern" judgments or evaluations of "modernism," see Charles Altieri,
"The Powers and the Limits of Oppositional Postmodernism," <I>American
Literary History</I> 2 (fall 1990): 443-81.

This line of argument originated in early, and often marxist, analysesof
the high-modern insistence that art occupied a sphere of its own,
analyses that saw this insistence as deceptive and indicative of a desire
to avoid potentially destabilizing debates about the social and political
structure of the world. For a more general critique, see Stanley Fish,
"Unger and Milton," in his <I>Doing What Comes Naturally: Change,
Rhetoric, and the Practice of Theory in Literary and Legal Studies</I>
(Durham, N. C.: Duke University Press, 1989), 399-435; and Martin
Stone, "The Placement of Politics in Roberto Unger's <I>Politics,</I>"

Again, we see this in early marxist analyses of modern alienation,which
see that posture as a sign of unhappiness without which the urgency
of conceptualizing alternative worlds might vanish. More recently, Roberto
Unger has made the resistance to identification that this position
celebrates the basis of a postfoundational politics that he calls
Superliberalism. Superliberalism is defined by its commitment to the
heightened artificiality, plasticity, or disposability of all social
arrangements, or, as Unger writes, by its commitment to the pervasive
"availability to challenge" of structure as such (Roberto Mangabeira
Unger, <I>False Necessity: Anti-necessitarian Social Theory in the Service
of Radical Democracy,</I> vol. 1 of <I>Politics: A Work in Constructive
Social Theory</I> [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987], 362).
Richard Rorty has been one of Unger's most enthusiastic supporters, and
Judith Butler has recently elaborated the kind of resistance in question
here in a provocative analysis of the work of Drucilla Cornell and Ernesto
Laclau. See Roberto Unger, <I>Politics: A Work in Constructive Social
Theory,</I> 3 vols.; Richard Rorty, "Unger, Castoriadis, and the Romance
of a National Future," <I>Northwestern University Law Review</I> 82
: 325-51; and Judith Butler, "Poststructuralism and
Postmarxism," <I>Diacritics</I> 23 (winter 1993), 3-11.

The kind of work I have in mind tends to identify itself aspostmodern,
and to proceed under the assumption that current philosophical
and intellectual work has conclusively established the politically
reactionary nature of commitments to unity, identity, and consensus, and
the politically progressive nature of commitments to difference,
plurality, and marginality. As Terry Eagleton has recently observed, this
stance, while increasingly accepted as a matter of course, is less
philosophically sound than it appears: "Nobody on the left," Eagleton
writes, "wants to see a plurality of fascist parties, praises a social
group . . . just because of its marginality, or mistakes the solidarity of
the ANC for some tyrannical totality." As Eagleton goes on to suggest, the
formalism of this style of thought testifies not so much to successful
theorizing as to unsuccessful practice, or, as he puts it, the formalism
of this style of thought is "a symptom of the left's current bafflement,
not a solution to it." (Terry Eagleton, "Discourse and Discos: Theory in
the Space Between Culture and Capitalism," <I>The New York Times Literary
Supplement,</I> 15 July 1994, 3-4)

For instance, it has long been argued that the desire forcohesion or
community evident in the work of a re like Eliot is
reactionary, since that desire involves valorizing sameness over
difference, and since that valorization involves compromising an autonomy
or "otherness" that difference respects. Yet the same valorization of
sameness over difference also informs the work of a re like Langston
Hughes (think of his poem "The Negro Speaks of Rivers"), committed as it
often is to the formation of a racial community from distinct individuals.
To point out the similarities between the formal commitment that Eliot and
Hughes share is not necessarily to revise our sense of the political
judgments we make about their work, but it does indicate the degree to
which the judgments we make will depend upon recognizing the specific
natures of the projects to which the two res were committed, and upon
recovering the <I>specific fields of operation</I> within which those
commitments assumed or failed to assume their force.

<P>
On these grounds we may wish to retain our sense that the sameness to
which Eliot was committed was conservative, even reactionary, while the
sameness to which Hughes was committed was progressive. But what of the
resistance to the requirement of racial sameness evident at times in the
work of res like Countee Cullen and Jean Toomer? Is that resistance
reactionary simply because Hughes's commitment to sameness appears
progressive in contrast to Eliot's? And what of the possibility that
Eliot's commitment to community derived its force from a resistance to the
kind of nationalism understood to have precipitated World War I? Is
Eliot's commitment reactionary even if it emerged as a critique of
European nationalism? To ask these questions is to point to the limits of
approaching them formally, while also indicating the necessity of
returning to the work in question in order to examine the grounds upon
which political judgments about it have been made. It is to take seriously
an insistence most recently associated with the work of Pierre Bourdieu:
an adequate analysis of any discourse and its force must be based on a
systematic reconstruction of the field within which such discourse is
produced and received, with its distinctive forms of organization,
production, perception, and so on. For an analysis of the modern period
that is attentive to this insistence, see Edward Said on Yeats in his
<I>Culture and Imperialism</I> (New York: Knopf, 1993); for an analysis of
an earlier period, see Frances Ferguson's inquiry into transcendental
thought in <I>Solitude and the Sublime: Romanticism and the Aesthetics of
Individuation</I> (New York: Routledge, 1992).
