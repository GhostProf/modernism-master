<p>This essay begins to untangle the complex and ignored erotic friendship and collaboration between Bryher and Marianne Moore, during the years 1920-1923. Until recently, as Wayne Koestenbaum explains in <span style="font-style:italic;">Double Talk</span>, critics have often disparaged and misread collaboration. He contrasts the Goncourt brothers' exceptional declaration that their work represented one self, one confession, one "I" with the conventional notion of the male genius working alone. Given that "male collaboration had already earned a reputation for perversity," the dual authorship of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, for instance, was initially concealed.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Even so, Koestenbaum explains, the poem unveils "an epoch we might call The Age of Inversion, when heterosexuality was in the process of being undermined and traduced by its eerie opposite."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> The startling discovery that J.A. Symonds (spokesman for Decadent modernism), shortly before his death, had collaborated with Havelock Ellis on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Inversion</span>  is emblematic of how collaborative relationships, like the works they produced, were in themselves modernist experiments.</p>
<p>What of female collaborations in the "Age of Inversion"? While all collaborations are not based on friendships, the two are usually linked. Much work has been done to illuminate the networking and collaboration within female modernism.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Same-sex friendship, like collaboration, has remained a somewhat sacrosanct zone, set apart from romantic or erotic entanglements. In her fascinating study of negative or "backward" feelings in modernist queer writers, Heather Love writes: "The history of friendship is a particularly attractive archive for the exploration <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of same-sex relations, partly because of the relative absence of stigma, and partly because of the relatively unstructured nature of friendship as a mode of intimacy."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> More pertinently here, friendship apparently "holds out the promise of an autonomous space away from the tremors of eroticism, and also from eros's relentless narrative logic of pursuit, consummation, and exhaustion. Being with the friend is an end in itself. There is no orgasm of friendship; wedding bells do not ring for friends."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> It is against this "promise" of friendship that I propose a more muddied conflux of attraction and collaboration—one inspired by Love's emphasis upon "negative structures of feeling" and the call for an expanded queer literary historiography. My argument relies to a large extent upon a psychoanalytic model of transference, developed during modernism, which provides a necessary vocabulary for reframing collaboration. Transference, as a complex term of art, will be further defined and teased out later in this essay, but suffice it to say at the outset, that transference is part of all relationships, and can be differentiated from the conventional analytic situation, and newly enacted when unstated emotional currents and projective fantasies between individuals are routed through material, in this case literary, production.</p>
<p>As an illuminating case study, I examine Moore's erotic friendship, collaboration and transference with Bryher, born Annie Winifred Ellerman, illegitimate daughter of Sir John Ellerman, a shipping magnate, and the richest man in England upon his death in 1933. Bryher is an exemplary re through which to explore the question of "inverted collaboration" and transference, given her numerous material and psychic interactions with cohorts, friends, lovers, and analysts. However, Bryher is, to a much greater extent than Moore, recognized more for her <span style="font-style:italic;">absence</span> in modernist history than otherwise. For instance, Jayne Marek writes Bryher's "multifaceted support of publishing activities has been largely overlooked"<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup>; I would go further and say that virtually all Bryher's "activities" have been "largely overlooked." Bryher was decidedly not T.S. Eliot with his vague inklings toward inversion, as Koestenbaum portrays him in his "perverse" collaboration; rather, she repeatedly and unabashedly claimed she should have been a boy, and resisted her mother's attempt throughout her adolescence to mould her into a perfect miss. In February 1919, Bryher met sexologist Havelock Ellis, who confirmed "she was only a girl by accident."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> Armed with the terminology of inversion and her new romance with the poet H.D. (born Hilda Doolittle, dubbed <span style="font-style:italic;">H.D., Imagiste</span> by Pound), Bryher still could not embrace an openly lesbian or transgender life. Instead, she married twice for "convenience," and eventually adopted H.D.'s illegitimate child, Perdita, a scenario paradigmatic of the closet as well as of Bryher's radical meddling with the Edwardian family.</p>
<p>Bryher wrote the first critical book on Amy Lowell, fourteen novels, three memoirs, and two books of poetry. These books are to a great extent buried, and Bryher is known, if at all, for her roles as lover, companion, and caretaker of H.D., and secondarily as a patron of experimental modernists.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Yet Bryher not only monetarily and emotionally supported the creative endeavors of H.D. but also those of a host of other modernists in varying degrees, among the most notable—James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Norman Douglas, Edith Sitwell, Dorothy Richardson, Sylvia Beach, and Moore. Her wealth <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  enabled her to fund alternate artistic and political ventures as well as psychoanalysis; she used her home in Switzerland in the late thirties to smuggle over a hundred and five refugees fleeing Nazi Germany (many of them psychoanalysts). Her "accidental" gender, her own illegitimacy, and great wealth, among other factors, kept her giving endlessly, fuelling what I elsewhere refer to as "the melancholy of money," and what Moore called her "suicidal generosity," suggesting her need to compensate and substitute for an ongoing sense of loss.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> In essence, Bryher's literary and cultural reputation was thwarted by her overt expression of what Judith Halberstam has dubbed "female masculinity," or in Bryher's contemporary parlance, her inversion.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> In fact, her intimate relationship to the bisexual H.D. for over forty years as well as her wealth, which established the reputation of dozens of others, did more to obscure Bryher than foreground her.</p>
<p>What has this to do with Moore specifically? There is no existing book-length biography of Bryher,<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> let alone consideration of her as a serious re within Moore's creative and affective universe, with notable exceptions being the respective biographic and archival work of Patricia Willis and Linda Leavell. Cristanne Miller, in addition, has opened up new perspectives on Moore <span style="font-style:italic;">in relation</span> to others, especially as a transnational re, linking her with Else Lasker-Schüler and Mina Loy.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Nevertheless, most critics underestimate Bryher's pivotal role in Moore's life, and common lore (in spite of Willis and Leavell) persists in branding Moore as asexual. In turn, the relationship between Bryher and Moore is often generalized as sanitized friendship without the "tremors of eroticism."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> While I have no pleasure thermometer by which to measure such tremors, my aim here is two-fold: to uncover through close reading and archival research a significant modernist collaboration, Bryher and Moore's; and to redefine female collaboration as having multi-dimensional creative, psychological, monetary, and ultimately, transferential aesthetic and erotic significance through the more ignored Bryher.</p>
<p>Driven by personal and passionate desires, Bryher's work often conred itself in triangular collaborations. For instance, through her ménage a trois with Kenneth Macpherson (her second husband of convenience) and H.D., Bryher spearheaded the first film journal in English <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span> in 1927, which garnered translations of Sergei Eisenstein, contributions from Gertrude Stein, theoretical analysis by the psychoanalyst and founder of <span style="font-style:italic;">American Imago</span>, Hanns Sachs (Bryher's analyst), and even several film reviews by Moore. The trio also made the avant-garde film <span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span> , starring Paul and Eslanda Robeson along with H.D., with its intricate montage work, what Macpherson called "transferential," a word he used to denote slippage and emotional transfer between shots and characters.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> I point to these later collaborations for their almost overstated fusion of the erotic and aesthetic, pointing up a necessary refining and expansion of modernist love, friendship, and collaboration. I realize these are large terrains, but I contend that these categories overlap, are not uniformly positive, and require greater biographical nuance within an historical context of stigmatized non-heterosexual bonds. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Like the later "transferential" relationship enacted with H.D. and Macpherson, with its origins in the group's psychoanalytic reading of desire and transference, Bryher's relationship to Moore between 1920 and 1923 sets forth a template for Bryher's future collaborations. Transference, in this context, becomes a form of collaboration, a psychological as well as aesthetic enactment. Given that I rely on the process of psychoanalytic transference throughout this piece and that, to my knowledge, my application of them to modernist writers and lives has not been tried, I first sketch out the terminology's main elements. For Freud, transference "emerges as <span style="font-style:italic;">the most powerful resistance</span> to the treatment," given that this resistance will be to the uncovering the prototypic unfulfilled desires from early development: "If someone's need for love is not entirely satisfied by reality, he is bound to approach every new person whom he meets with libidinal anticipatory ideas" which become played out with the analyst.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> James Strachey summarized this early theorizing in 1934: "Transference was regarded predominantly as a <span style="font-style:italic;">libidinal</span> phenomenon. It was suggested that in everyone there existed a certain number of unsatisfied libidinal impulses, and that whenever some new person came upon the scene these impulses were ready to attach themselves to him."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Further developing my working terminology, in Freud's language, transferences are enabled as "new editions or facsimiles of the impulses and fantasies that are aroused and made conscious during the progress of the analysis; but they have this peculiarity . . . that they replace some earlier person by the person of the physician."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Through transference, love that is "thrown by the patient upon the analyst provided the necessary extra force to induce his ego to give up its resistances, undo the repressions and adopt a fresh solution of its ancient problems" ("Therapeutic Action," 53). Furthermore, transferences can be negative or positive: not all the emotions unleashed are loving; some are hostile and aggressive ("Therapeutic Action," 53).</p>
<p>Even though both Freud and Strachey broaden the occurrence of transference outside of analysis to "whenever a new person came on the scene," strictly speaking, transference would seem to necessitate analyst and analysand. Thus it would seem inappropriate to apply it to two writers, given that they are not replicating the analytic situation in its closed enactment and with, of course, the analyst usually positioned as the re of authority. Counter-transference would allow for a two-way projection of libidinal desires, but depends upon an initial transference and control by the analyst; by contrast, collaboration occurs between a duo that is not fixed, and the positions of analyst and analysand (as it were) ostensibly shift continually.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Moore and Bryher were not in analysis with one another. Nevertheless, I argue that transference theory offers potent and appropriate language for discussing what Freud called the "conditions for loving," wherein an analysand replicates an earlier prototype or the "infantile roots of her love."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Transference love, then, according to Roy Schafer, "is sheerly repetitive, merely a new edition of the old, artificial and regressive [. . .] and to be dealt with chiefly by translating it back into its infantile terms. [. . .] On the other hand, transference is a piece of real life that is adapted to the analytic purpose" ("Conditions for Loving," 405). The blurring of the analytic situation and "real" life is already present in Freud's provocative assertion: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "it is true that the [transference-] love consists of new editions of old traits and that it repeats infantile reactions. But this is the essential character of every state of being in love. There is no such state which does not reproduce infantile prototypes."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> For my purposes, it is helpful to think of Bryher and Moore's charged relationship—with its regressions, repressions, projections—as creating a proto-analytic situation, where correspondence, writing, and publications became markers of the "latest edition" of an earlier incarnation of shadowy love, or the "conditions of love." I construe literary collaboration as possessing a more erotized, emotional contour when transference is included as part of the equation.</p>
<p>I particularly seize upon Bryher's bond with Moore to examine the mechanics of creativity in the age of inversion where to "transfer" emotions and experiences had plural meanings for those who experienced at least some of their desires as unwanted or misdirected. Through this prism, I shed light on how modernist same-sex collaborations functioned, as did theirs, within a complicated mesh of power, debt, desire, and friendship. Bryher's relationship to Moore constituted an aesthetic erotic conjunction, supplementary to the poet's "aesthetic domestic conjunction" with her mother, who must be deferred to as Moore's most significant collaborator as well as transferential object.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> In aesthetic-erotic conjunctions, intellectual imperatives converge with erotic and economic ones; collaboration then becomes a matter of different forms of psychic interaction that extend beyond literal publication of a jointly conceived work to a larger field of exchanges. In the period I examine, Bryher and Moore engaged in the excitement of mutual criticism and recognition, the first flush of friendship, identification, homoerotic flirtation, and disavowal of erotic attachment. Their significant, if elusive, literary and transferential collaboration has passed mostly under the radar, yet it had immediate impact upon Bryher's development, upon Moore and, in less quantifiable ways, upon modernism more generally.</p>
<p>I here first lay out the arc of the essay as a whole before taking up each phase in this complex relationship. To highlight Bryher's and Moore's "courtship" as a form of transference, I zoom in upon a forgotten work and document of modernism, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, Bryher's novelistic telling of her travel in America. It is a narrative that foregrounds her developing "romance" with Moore and projects her own sense of herself as male adventurer, as well as her desire to mimic and reframe her father's mobility as shipping magnate. Drafted during Bryher's cross-country journey from 1920 through 1921 and culled from her correspondence with Moore, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> (published as <span style="font-style:italic;">West</span> in 1925) provides an intriguing site to examine their collaboration.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> A back and forth exchange of letters (as if part of an ongoing analysis) during this period helped create <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, given that Bryher incorporated Moore's language, and then sent the manuscript back with this recycled material for approval, and then for marketing (at Moore's invitation). In Bryher's seeking approval, taking on both the role of the young, still-developing writer and rescuer, Moore became a kind of "auxiliary super-ego," the role Strachey assigns the analyst ("Therapeutic Action," 61). Moore responded to the portrait of herself by Bryher as speedily enacted (written as it was upon the pair's early friendship), a reaction underscored in her further displeasure at Bryher's hasty and, for Moore, unexpected, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  even "inconvenient," first marriage of convenience on Valentine's Day 1921 to Robert McAlmon. Outside <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, "wedding bells do ring for friends," only not for my two friends, or erotic collaborators, but for Bryher and their mutual associate, McAlmon. The marriage was followed by the funding, editing and publication of Moore's <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> (July 1921) by the gang of three—Bryher (at the helm), H.D., and McAlmon. <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>, I suggest, was a form of unwanted ravishment of Moore by Bryher, whose sense of being seduced by Moore replicates the conventional transferential trajectory, while it does not erase Moore's own erotic feelings for Bryher. Meanwhile, Moore repudiated <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> while "feeling flattered and encouraged by what she calls 'the chivalry of the undertaking.'" <sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Bryher's "transferred" affections that went into showcasing <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> coincided with Moore's continued efforts to market <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>. In 1922, Bryher published <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrow Music</span>, a book of poems generally dismissed as "backward," evidently influenced by Lowell and H.D.'s imagism; the poems express an extremely open eroticism, and bear some traces of what she wrote about Moore in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> as we will see.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Subsequent to these historic personal and aesthetic events, Moore's later poem "Marriage" , was largely prompted, as Patricia Willis reveals, by Bryher's marriage and Moore's own identification with those who need to apply their "criminal ingenuity" to "avoid / it."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Bryher's literal wedding thus helped to beget "Marriage," a commentary upon those included as well as excluded by the heterosexual imperative, containing a personal address to Bryher as Eve "so handsome / she gave me a start." "Marriage" confirmed an ongoing behind-the-scenes collaboration, based on a desire to nurse perceptions and projections, drawing upon and recreating the other's writing and communication, formulated in the poem's borrowed quip: "'I should like to be alone; / why not be alone together?'" (This paradox anticipates D.W. Winnicott's description of the intimacy of analysis as "being alone together") ("Conditions for Loving," 411). Such an "ideal" mode of collaboration, without explicit contract (alone and together), exists along both the axis of the aesthetic—including the pragmatic aims of being published—and the erotic. In an earlier manuscript of the poem, Elizabeth W. Young discovered an excised line from the drafted beginning of the poem: "This institution should one say enterprise which is universally associated with the fear of loss."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Yet it is rather the fear of loss that precludes erotic adventure and deep attachment. Moore's ceaseless marketing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>—a book she didn't fully endorse but which expressed Bryher's affection for her—suggests that Moore continued to hold on to the disarticulated fantasy of their flirtation. Marketing was a way of consolidating the pair's bond: <span style="font-style:italic;">to get someone published</span> (crude as this sounds) can have an erotic dimension, standing in for a publication of bans for a marriage. In this case, it also nicely calls up Freud's idea of transference as minting a "new edition" of a loved prototype. With such biographical and literary events in mind, my essay calls for a reconration of modernist collaborations between women through the emotional thoroughfare of transference.</p>
<p>At first glance, Bryher's overtures towards Moore may look more like non-collaboration, or the acts of someone in need of monopolizing the other. But Moore <span style="font-style:italic;">did</span> "co-labor" with Bryher, and did take her very seriously. In reading drafts and the final copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> in 1921, Moore reinforced the image Bryher fashioned of Moore <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  as "boy scribe" and eccentric "pterodactyl," even though she found aspects of the manuscript to criticize—this too is part of what we may call negative collaboration. Understandably, inter-subjective collaboration is fraught with projections on both sides, yet where established in correspondence and other writing, it should be considered as part of a broader continuum of creative and affective transference, beyond idealized romantic friendships. If Bryher called upon Moore in her psychic processes of fashioning an identity apart from England and her father (perhaps even apart from H.D.), Moore reinforced a view of her own self as "boyish," both in need of and not in need of "rescue," while she also praised and internalized Bryher's repertoire of male identifications. This, of course, complicates how we regard lesbian desire: both women variously identified as boy-like, which did not exclude their desire for each other. We might think of Moore's multiplicity as incident to Bonnie Costello's apt description of the poet as "kleptomaniac of the mind," in her use of fragments and quotations from many sources;<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> the interpersonal scenario I invoke denotes "liftings" and transfers, collage (slang for marriage),<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> inter-psychic borrowings and identifications.</p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>Before Bryher met Moore in the flesh in September 1920 and began what I am calling the collaborative transference constituted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, she had already been seduced. The courtship was conducted in black and white. I provide here a synopsis of what they knew of each other through published writing. By 1918, H.D. supplanted Amy Lowell as Bryher's primary mentor (Lowell directed Bryher to H.D.'s work). H.D. captured Bryher's complete intellectual and erotic attention; in short, Bryher memorized <span style="font-style:italic;">Sea Garden</span>  before she first sought out the poet in July 1918. She then incorporated H.D. as her poetic "ego-ideal" as they two engaged in their own unusual romance. Moore, I contend, would temporarily divert Bryher's aesthetic and psychological affections. Bryher fell for "The Fish" when it appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> in 1918, and at H.D's instruction, Bryher read every poem she could find of Moore's.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> On the one hand, "The Fish," with its submarine explosions and mutilations, conveys the contemporary experience of war; on the other hand, it evoked the freshness of Bryher's beloved Cornwall—the fish, evasive, swift, touching upon bodies of light and texture, while moving in and out of "crevices." The "defiant edifice" of "The Fish" struck a chord that would continue to sound, so that by 1940, Bryher was still writing about it: "I had to be shown Marianne Moore but once I discovered 'wade // through black jade / of the crow-blue mussel shells' I was her prisoner for life."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>But what of Bryher's effect upon Moore? After meeting H.D., Bryher published several poems Moore would have seen, including "Adventure" in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bostonian</span> (February 1919) with its plea "Do not pass me like the wind," as well as Bryher's first two forays into prose publication, which evidenced telltale signs of inversion.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> A couple months after H.D. introduced the pair in New York in 1920, Moore praised Bryher's essay "Elizabethan Drama and The Girl-Page" (written in 1918, and published in 1920 in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Fortnightly</span>, exploring girls dressed up as boys): "Your 'Girl-Page' has come <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and I hope you do not begrudge me the pleasure I have had from it." She confessed to have copied two paragraphs in her commonplace book, and continued: "I like the exposition of wildness. At the end, 'the imagination of a child joined to the freedom of a boy' sums the thing up very well."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Indeed, this synthesis might encapsulate the psychosexual trajectory of both women who identified strongly with Peter Pan.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure:</span> the Kiss</h1>
<p>One and a half year old Perdita and her nurse in tow, Bryher, and H.D. arrived on September 10, 1920 in New York. In her "Unpublished Autobiography," Perdita dates her first memory to this transatlantic voyage with "two mothers" on the S.S. Adriatic.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> All of her adolescence and early adulthood, America dominated Bryher's fantasies of adventure and creative fulfillment. Her father worried it was unstable and dangerous, but for Bryher, the First World War cast a pall over London, leaving it utterly dead. Imagining that in America she could not only tap into H.D.'s creative sources, but could also strut about in trousers and be as mannish as she liked, she threatened her transatlantic correspondent Lowell that she would come dressed as a boy. Lowell had already written to Bryher that she'd be better off wearing men's clothes in London, warning: "in one of our small Western towns, the speed with which you would find yourself in the lock-up would really astonish you."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Nevertheless, Bryher cut her hair in preparation for the journey, which she considered the most important act of her life up to that point. As it turned out, both America and Lowell disappointed Bryher. However, sometime in September 1920, H.D. arranged a meeting for Moore and Bryher at the historic Hotel Brevoort, and across the tea table was Moore—an idiosyncratic homo-emotional incarnation, a soul mate, who lived with her mother and whom Bryher believed needed rescue from her family. The photo (below) of Bryher taken in Cornwall in 1921 after her return to England from America nicely captures one of Bryher's characteristic poses and would have been close to what Marianne saw when she met Bryher. Although Bryher masqueraded in dresses in New York, this particular stance of boyish defiance was what, as we shall see, Bryher communicated to Moore in her correspondence. The shot of Moore leaning on a ship deck in the summer of 1920 shows the poet just before the pair met. Moore looks plucky, reserved, and sexually indeterminate—a re immediately appealing to Bryher, who had always dreamed of running away to sea. Such were the twin "female masculinities," who identified with and cultivated each other.</p>
<p>In 1920, Moore was thirty-three, and had not yet published her first book. The twenty-six year old Bryher began a campaign of encouraging, teasing, aggravating, promoting, and flirting with the poet. This desire was self-reflexive: Moore was a gender outsider whose own brand of flirtation and liminal position mirrored Bryher's.</p>
<p>Bryher's ongoing drama of self-fashioning included a desire to foster Moore's "development" (a word that obsessed Bryher), and to render it part of her own narrative of "inversion." Leavell has demonstrated that, while Moore probably did not consider herself an "invert," she did recognize a divide between herself and the heterosexual <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  template. After a major crush on William James's daughter, Peggy, a classmate, at Bryn Mawr, where such crushes were an "institution," Moore became a passionate celibate, a "literary bachelor": "[a]lthough she may never have had a sexually intimate relationship, she did participate in what (Adrienne) Rich has defined broadly as a 'lesbian continuum' that can include many forms of 'primary intensity between and among women.'"<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> In addition, Bryher's motifs of male identification, adventure, and mobility percolated in her own work. The two also cherished <span style="font-style:italic;">Swiss Family Robinson</span> as well as popular boy's adventure tales. I go further to suggest that Moore was far from asexual, and Bryher was not simply looking for the next great modernist poet; that the pair's mutual identification of female masculinity and transferential collaboration constituted Moore's most likely erotic affair after Peggy James.</p>

<p>A back and forth sparring, an overture in letters, revolving around aesthetic sensibility began in Bryher's pivotal letter to Moore on September 24, 1920 from Santa Barbara, California. She expressed respectful puzzlement and wonder in the face of her new friend's elliptical style:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I am not sure that I have succeeded in discovering the precise meaning of the poems. I have a general impression of a world before the fish age where shells cling to a rock and whether the shell was just a shell knowing its own rock perfectly—the boundary of its own ledges—or whether the shell was the entire world I have neither discovered nor decided.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In some sense, Bryher is asking if the shell <span style="font-style:italic;">knew</span> its eco-relation with the rock, or whether the shell believed it was "the entire world"? To put the implied questions bluntly: did Moore know her limits, crave contact with the larger world, and desire relationship? Perhaps this is a leap, for Moore gave a cool, if gracious, response: "I have had so much curiosity about the world before the fish age that I am pleased to have reminded you of it" (October 17, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span> 134). Yet the "rock" is another re for the Sapphic island. To Bryher, Moore was not of her age, but existed from the perspective of literary experiment at its cutting edge. Moore was thus a perfect "case study" for Bryher's ongoing obsession with the process of development: How do conventions of education and social training hamper it? How does the female or queer artist develop—in isolation or with others? What does she do with her "boyish" proclivities? Bryher casts Moore into a "fish-age," suggestive of a sensual, aqueous world without fixed gender norms; at the same time, throughout her correspondence with Moore, she craves some more definite expression. There is a moment in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Gatsby</span> when a pair of lovers at a grand party is about to kiss, but they never do; for Fitzgerald, this ideal moment before fantasy degrades into reality. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, the kiss never happens, but desire remains in circulation, and was only fulfilled through the contact produced in the pair's manuscript exchange.</p>
<p>Within the time frame examined here, Moore read the draft of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> in progress; she encouraged the book and then vigorously tried to market it. There are at least two narratives expressed in this interchange: Moore's variegated letters, both flirting and resisting, in response to Bryher's urgings in letters and her draft, and Bryher's incorporation of this correspondence into her own "plot." These women took letters very seriously, so that an epistolary form allowed them to work out creative processes, express divergent desires tantamount to sexual activity, and to contribute to a larger exchange within modernism.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after their meeting, Moore introduced Bryher to McAlmon, another up and coming poet at the periphery of her circle. He co-edited a low-budget American-centered journal with William Carlos Williams, <span style="font-style:italic;">Contact</span>. H.D. encouraged Bryher's separate friendships with both Moore and McAlmon. During the first couple of months in America, Bryher sent Moore <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span> before launching upon <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> (inspired by Moore). Bryher wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span>, a memoir/novel begun in 1916 and published first in Britain in July 1920 by Constable and then in America in December the same year, due to Lowell's marketing efforts (the edition contains an explanatory preface by Lowell). Bryher regarded her boarding school experience as a "violation of the spirit."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Bryher sent Moore <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span> while traveling across America with H.D. and family. This first novel/memoir of Bryher's further fit into the epoch's growing recognition of the existence of the so-called "third sex,"<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> and captured Bryher's apparently insoluble predicament: "Her one regret was that she was a girl . . . She tried to forget, to escape any reference to being a girl . . . She was sure if she hoped enough she would turn into a boy."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Moore praised <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span> in a letter: "[t]he positiveness and absence of exaggeration in the narration give it an authoritativeness which is very striking and instinctiveness and intenseness of the wording, give to a great many of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the lines, the force of poetry" (November 29th, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 136). Bryher's experience of gender eccentricity struck a chord with Moore: "the great feature of [<span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span>]" is "[t]he exposition of the baffled sense one has of being outside what it is one's birthright to enjoy" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 137). Moore's largely favorable review the following year (in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dial</span> 70, May 1921) praised the book as "a flower cluster mounted on a tall spike," while noting that "in human development the flowering stage is many times this side of maturity." <sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Moore's combination of gender connotations—"cluster" "spike"—suggests that the "flowering stage" may not arrive according to social dictates or expectations. "Juxtaposed," she observed, "we have impetuosity and philosophic endurance of what cannot be helped," while also noting that Bryher's "envying a boy his freedom and his clothes," was a "view" that is "somewhat curtailed" (note Moore's witty pun) for "woman is more nearly at liberty to assume man's dress than man is able to avail himself of the opportunities for self-expression afforded by the variations in color and fabric which a woman may use."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Although H.D. regularly corresponded with Moore during this period, the emotional tenor of their letters never seemed to fire any attraction. Despite separate intrigues, H.D. and Bryher managed to forge a new family, including H.D.'s daughter, Perdita, and H.D.'s mother (Mrs. Doolittle was dubbed the "Beaver" by the set). Together they made a pilgrimage from New York City to California and back. During her trip West, Bryher corresponded with Moore and McAlmon, all the while penning <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> with both poets as characters in it, Moore taking center stage. The travelogue combines fiction and memoir, incorporating her ongoing correspondence with Moore. Its thinly disguised characters include Bryher as Nancy, H.D. as Helga, Lowell as Lyall, Moore as Anne, and McAlmon as Magnus West. <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> thus binds multiple strands of Bryher and Moore's unusual romance of ambivalent but mutual attraction and exchange. Moore as Anne Trollope is not a purely platonic friend, but a re of attraction: "[h] er austere boyish head, her flushed face about the prim white collar was vivid with excitement" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 35). Enamored with the "boyish head," Nancy demands Anne "send [her] everything" she has "ever written."</p>
<p>Written as the "adventure" was unfolding, the novel/memoir records the arrival "at the gates of New York"—"War and the old world were eastward in the blackness. Lights were ahead of them . . . rifted stars . . . an outline . . . swinging lanterns" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 22)—the short meeting with Moore (as Anne), and follows the menagerie from New York to Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to Carmel and back through Los Angeles to Monrovia. From Monrovia to the Mexican border, they confront orange orchards, competing with advertisements for Sunkist, Pasadena's Million Dollar Homes, and a booster's slogan: "Come to California and Forget You're Forty" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 123). They leave the land of broken dreams and ripe fruit, speeding by train through Arizona—with the hot sun, red canyons, white cattle bones and sage. They pass through open fields, and a blizzard in Chicago. When Nancy arrives back in New York, she has seen an alien world, imperfect but wondrous. Rounding out her adventure as its homo-emotional apex, she has lunch with Anne in Greenwich Village. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>While in Santa Barbara, Bryher had prodded Moore (in the same letter where she affectionately situated Moore in "the fish-age") to publish a poetry volume because she explains "it is a little difficult to get people interested in your work when it has to be sought for in the sparse pages of magazines."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> The advice proffered by Bryher's letters parallel that of her fictional character, Nancy, urging Anne to publish. For Bryher, we recall, Moore's poems had a porous relationship between "edge" and center. To be at the edge was also the state of mind Bryher navigated as she traveled—a state where collaboration was conditioned by distance, movement and indeterminate edges.</p>
<p>After Bryher praised Moore's attractive difficulty in this letter, she speculated upon the pair's possible differences: "I imagine we are so different in thought that it makes for barriers. I should have been very happy in Carthage watching elephants with Tyrian laurels crush the marigolds as they moved along the paths while you, I fear, would prefer the thin lines of a herd of gazelles that merge in with desert and are swift and quiet" (<span style="font-style:italic;">RML</span>). Bryher's discontent with the conspicuous consumption of Santa Barbara ("Everyone is rich, everyone has one, two or three motorcars, and there is no a sign of wildness or freedom"), returned the meditative traveler back to Moore's poems:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Since the war in England most girls go about in riding breeches and old coats in the country and I thought out here I could get into them again all the time but certainly it is not possible here. It is much too civilized. I liked New York so much and I hope to come back there for two or three months next spring. To me it was so beautiful and free of the sense of death that hangs over all of Europe since the war. I feel Europe is a bleak nightmare I do not wish to remember. [. . .] I like "Dock Rats" best of the poems but all interested me very much. As I wrote I see a cold sea, a few rocks, one or two shells thinking about the fish to be born perhaps in a million years; all sharp lines. <span style="font-style:italic;">I hope soon the poems will be collected into a volume</span></p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">RML</span>; emphasis added).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Even though Moore had not met Bryher when the former published "Dock Rats" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Others</span> , it anticipates the entrance of the shipping heiress into her life and iterates the call for adventure and "a good / place to come / home to", summed up in various vessels the poem catalogues ("square-rigged four-master, the liner, / the battleship, like the two- /thirds submerged section of an iceberg" and "ferry boat," hinting at Whitman's "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry." It is understandable why Bryher singles the poem out, considering its publication in a known experimental venue, its reminder of her father's industry, and her voracious desire for travel: "to one who has been accustomed / to it, shipping is the / most congenial thing in the world" ("Dock Rats," <span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 247). The poem also begs the question if Bryher knew (perhaps through H.D.) that her family called Moore "rat" (she will by December). Still the letter (as quoted above) represents how Bryher's imagination was becoming entangled (together and alone) with Moore's. "As I wrote I see" indicate Bryher's effort to make her letters catch up with present experience, ready to transmute into <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>. The passage further underscores her sense of Moore's style—"the fish to be born perhaps in a million years" is both archaic and oriented towards the future. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In her letter to Bryher dated October 15, 1920, Moore emphasized her new friend's desire for adventure as well as her own:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I hope you have been able to wear your riding breeches and do as you please. Have you found any horses? I cannot imagine anything more delightful than riding through the woods by the sea, in California. Unless it were to look at the elephants of which you speak—in Carthage. I hope that I don't give a false impression of myself in my poems for there is nothing I love more, than the concrete and there is an especial romance I think, about elephants</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 134).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Just as Bryher projected herself out among the rocks to see "all sharp lines," Moore participated in Bryher's fantasy "romance" of Carthage and elephants, and reinforced the depiction of herself in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> is an "especial romance," but it is also a survey of American prohibition, commoditization, superficial friendliness and "suburbia gone reckless" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 52). A billboard epitomizes slogan optimism: "Plenty of Water. Plenty of Sun. Settle in Albert and Forget your Neurasthenia" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 123). Yet while <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> is filled with Bryher's critique of America, the book's main drive is to pursue Anne, as representative American experimentalist. Helga, who "bade [Nancy] live," resides in the background, an interlocutor to poke fun at Nancy's past exaltation of America—"It must be quite a day since you told me that America is the future and that the only hope of the human race lies in the West. What has happened?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 48). Helga's poetry evokes "[f] lower leaf and salt water and a mind like a bird, diving everywhere"; Nancy as narrator then highlights the more restrained Anne, with her "submarine poems and her rock scratchings" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 69). In plucking out what she can from their correspondence, rewriting it into <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, Bryher thus collaborates with Moore as a psychic presence within the novel-memoir, akin to what Moore does with the texts she admires and refashions in her poems, letters, and reviews. But it is more than simply quoting the other; Bryher and Moore respond to each other in a highly tuned intimacy.</p>
<p>Just as Helga makes Nancy the butt of her own idealism, the real life Bryher courted and flirted with Moore, growing ever closer, even devising a pet name for her (December 13, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 157-8). In response to Bryher's inquiry, Moore offers Bryher a multitude of names: "I shall like any name you select for me; am in my family, a weasel, a coach-dog, a water-rat, a basilisk and an alligator and could be an armadillo, a bull-frog or anything that seems suitable to you" (December 13, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 157). This flirtatious pliancy with someone outside Moore's family reflected a singular familiarity. Based on an excerpt of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> she read in December 1920, Moore happily accepted the nickname, Pterodactyl. The literary text <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> thus sealed this appellation, and anchored the exchange. Bryher's portrait of the Pterodactyl Moore in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> has "heraldic" imagist force:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Beyond the window the tall width of the station held the summer sky on the square ledge of its roof. When the evening darkened gold would leap, barbaric fashion, in beads and rings along the midway floors. Anne leaned back, her hands folded on her lap, like some <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  heraldic version of a pterodactyl stiffly watching from its Jurassic rock, sea anemones open and close to the rhythm of the tides.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 39)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The description recruited Moore's identification, bearing the influence of "The Fish."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> In this light, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> seems almost written <span style="font-style:italic;">for her</span>—as a plea for Moore to collect her poems in a volume and to encourage Moore to come away to Europe or somewhere else exotic for an adventure. This small fragment of inter-psychic collaboration suggested how Bryher used her novel/memoir as a courtship, inter-cutting Moore's likes and dislikes, while wrestling with her dismay that America did not offer an immediate "going wild."</p>
<p>The process of writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> is akin to two films (at least) playing simultaneously: Bryher incorporates Moore's letters into her travel novel, and into her fantasy of Anne Trollope swimming among the seaweed and anemones. At the same time, the book records Bryher's post-war shock and reflects her relatively new relationship to H.D.—which was ostensibly overtly erotic.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> In Carmel, Nancy feels "billeted," given three movie crews are setting up scenes, firing guns, creating explosions (she was trying to escape the war, she cries out). Bryher records a funny scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>: several takes of a rescue in the waves are shot while a journalist snaps pictures of the filming with her Kodak; onlookers, among them, Mrs. Tinker admires the star, Martha Heywood (in real life, Mary Pickford):</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>'Martha, Martha,' the crowd rose with homage. The re kissed her fingers to them, stopped, called her maid.</p>
<p>'You can see she is a good woman,' old Mrs. Tinker sighed. 'She never takes off her wedding ring. Not even in a scene like this where she is supposed to be fifteen.'</p>
<p>'But she was divorced last month!'</p>
<p>'Oh, no, it wasn't legal. She had not been in residence long enough.'</p>
<p>Martha held up her hand for the crowd to watch. The ring was covered with a thick flesh-coloured substance.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 88)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">In truth, Mary Pickford had been divorced in March 1920 in Reno. The headlines of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span> in that month declaimed that Pickford pledged never to marry again, but in light of her subsequent marriage to Douglas Fairbanks the same month, this anecdote is not only interesting film gossip; it also directly underscores Bryher's own considerations of the rituals of matrimony as artifice, American prudishness, and sentimentality (that is Mrs. Tinker's naïve reaction). In spite of her sense of the film crew's unwanted invasion of Carmel, Bryher also penned an article "Mary Pickford in California," published in December 1920.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> Bryher's inclusion of the filming scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> oddly comments on Bryher's ménage, her incipient "false" union with McAlmon, and her attachment to Moore, who as Anne, is depicted as mounted on a rock; similarly, her piece on Pickford features a photograph of "Martha" rescuing a dying sailor on a rock and a film child on her lap.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>By January 1921, within four months of meeting Moore on only a few short occasions in the midst of debating numerous topics, including Carthage, fashion limits <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  upon women, her own writing before she met Moore, and both women's publishing possibilities, Bryher had made it clear that she viewed Moore's life as too limited. Bryher threatened to rescue Moore from what she perceived as the poet's confined circumstances, which paralleled both her own condition in England as well as her novel's conclusion, as we shall see. Bryher further wants to cut Marianne's luxuriant hair, and take her on exotic travels (Moore to Bryher; January 23, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 141). Repeated in the memoir-novel, Nancy describes Anne as "'really a young Byzantine scribe, all strange colours and angles,'" exclaiming to Helga: "'I should like to cut her hair short, her wonderful hair. Break her from everything to which she is accustomed and plunge her into a new world'"; Helga, meanwhile, wishes Nancy "'could try the experiment'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 102).</p>
<p>Echoing the above passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> and other letters from Bryher, Moore dissociates herself as third person, or rather third creature: "The pterodactyl has often thought of shortening its hair" (January 23, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 142), further objectifying the "pterodactyl": "[i]ts craving for peacock blue is the scandal of its rock." In Moore's fantasy about cutting her own hair, there was a coy yet erotic submission to the novel-memoir's suggestion, though Moore is already looking sexually indeterminate in photographs of the period. "Pterodactyl has an open mind with regard to Freud," the January letter continued. And then: "The pterodactyl's conscience hurts it." With a mock confession of guilt, her signature expressed both submission and resistance: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Love to H.D. Your trusting but disobedient</span>, pterodactyl."</p>
<p>Moore's fixation upon Bryher surfaces in her correspondence not only with Bryher, but also with H.D. as well as her brother. In the middle of one train of thought in a letter to H.D, she asks abruptly: "So B. is considered 'cute'?" (January 11, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 139). Though this query may be small, it points to her interest in Bryher's appearance. Although she had known Bryher for several months, Moore wrote to her brother, with the breathless enthusiasm she reserved for delicious gossip, a description of what Bryher planned to wear the next day to tea: "She looks as if she were 18 or twenty but is 26, had some beautiful Empress Josephine clothes Hilda says which she discarded for silks and suits when she turned artist. She is going to wear a cute black silk dress with short sleeves tomorrow with a red pattern of little flowers in circles and a high, low neck cut square" (February 13, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 143). Moore characteristically dwelt upon clothing and fabric, while signaling her attraction and ambivalence towards the rather femme (in this incarnation) rich girl "turned artist."</p>
<p>The very writing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> between 1920 and 1921, as the pair exchanged letters, marked an unusual courtship and complex transference which characterized Bryher as "hasty" and commanding, with Moore confessedly "not swift" and "disobedient." In the crucial letter of January 23, 1921, with her first signature as "your trusting but disobedient, pterodactyl," Moore's tone was playfully defiant, deflecting Bryher's insistence that she write and "forward [her] novel." This unpublished novel was evidently one of the confidences she shared with Bryher, yet she protested: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>But I am telling the truth when I say that if I had all the time in the world, I should not write anything for some years . . . I should like to look into certain things and <span style="font-style:italic;">make up my mind</span> with regard to the relevance or irrelevance of certain other things; . . . I have no swiftness. . . . The library is to some extent an incubus. . . . On the whole we live like anchorites . . .</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 141-2<span style="font-style:italic;">;</span> emphasis added).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Where Bryher "got" Marianne wrong, the letter advises, is in expecting gazelle-like swiftness in producing poetry or prose. She had let on to H.D. and Bryher she had started a novel, but she subsequently recants its readiness or plausibility.</p>
<p>Near the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, the chapter "Mushrooms and Pistachio Ice" (after what Anne orders for lunch) begins: "The Dactyl waited. A hasty message had summoned it. It was disguised in an Alpine hat, a frog-green coat and skirt. But unmistakable Jurassic eyes were swift to greet them and it hunched forward with decisive steps, fearful yet assured" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 145). Byher's attraction to the pterodactyl appears in the poem "The Pool" (also a H.D. title) from <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrow Music</span>: "Has no wing touched your cheek? / Is there no bird / to weave a nest between your sullen limbs / and hatch a songster, / (amber with lizard eyes) / to chirp above your phrases: " Love, love, love . . ." Notable is the poem's explicit sexuality as well as the phrase "(amber with lizard eyes)," echoing her description of Moore as "prehistoric" and now part of a series of poems called "Songs from the Stone Age," unwittingly calling up the language of transference which purportedly takes one back to "ancient" longings and early object choices. Meanwhile, in this scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, Nancy speculates that the jazz in the background at lunch is all that holds back chaos and the "prehistoric": "Had it not been for the sound the shapes would have fallen apart, black-and-white, orange, grey fur, into some entangled prehistoric heap, smoldering without purpose in the too white air" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 147). To Nancy's relentless effort to convince the poet to leave New York, Anne replies: "'Dactyls don't have to be rescued. They rescue themselves when the time comes'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 145).</p>
<p>In its bid to "rescue" the Dactyl, <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> attacks the "reactionary women" who have forgotten the "horror" and "awfulness" , projecting her own dilemma upon Anne:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Why did Anne carry it on, this Victorian tradition? . . . [I]t clashed with her hair, that curious bright forest colour, with her body that had the <span style="font-style:italic;">austere outline of a young scribe's form</span>, and with the bright mosaic of her mind. Her shrinking from life was masculine rather than a feminine gesture. It was the <span style="font-style:italic;">boy's denial of himself</span> for some misunderstood ideal</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 159; emphasis added).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Even if Anne (or Moore) did not accede to this reading, this passage intimates that the pterodactyl (and by extension Moore) is construed as "inverted" (like Bryher). Nancy demonstrates both a desire to "have" and to "be" this masculine young scribe who she wanted to liberate from "denial."</p>
<p>In reply to Bryher's conception of her as stunted, Moore claimed that her "ice-bound state" couldn't be blamed on bad education of the kind elucidated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span>; she <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  jokes: "You could not see any education that I have had, with a microscope" (December 13, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 137). According to Willis, "Bryher feared Moore was suffering the fate she tried to avoid <span style="font-style:italic;">while Moore felt alarm at Bryher's adventures to which she might have succumbed had her circumstances been different</span>" (emphasis added).<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> To some extent, Bryher imagined and inflated Moore's narrow straits. While Moore didn't envy Bryher's money, she might have imagined that with greater economic surety she would have more freedom. She admired the mobility of the "girl-page," wistfully telling Bryher, for instance, she wanted to fence (December 13, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 138), and then asking in the next month: "Does your father ever fence now? I am much excited to hear of his prowess, not to speak of your own" (January 10, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>).<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In this letter, Moore deflects Bryher's intense desire to bring her off her "rock" through complimentary spars and provides some basis for the depiction of her as seeking a larger sphere of action. In other words, within the correspondence, as depicted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, fantasy and reality blur as they do in psychoanalytic depictions of transference.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to her brother John, "the Badger," Moore expressed "absolute stupefaction" in the face of Bryher's continual reiteration that the poet should be out having adventures. Moore quotes Bryher "saying that she can't see the use of her [Marianne] being cooped up and kept to work when she might be writing, or riding an elephant." Moore's brother had not met Bryher, but he knew of her from his sister's letters. Bryher had proposed, offering the carrot, that <span style="font-style:italic;">if</span> Moore finished her novel, her father [Sir Ellerman] would finance an expedition. This trip, as Moore ambivalently appreciated, was "extended on the point of a sword," and echoing Bryher, that she'd have to behave like a "'good pterodactyl that will come out of its rock'" (January 23, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 141). To her brother, then, Moore gently mocked Bryher's "Dadda" who would arrange a cabin on the White Star Line, yet she considered "giving in": "I don't suppose we can go but I think there is some possibility that we might go. Mole [nickname of Mary Warner Moore] doesn't know what to say about it either. The library might let me go but if there is a possibility of Mole's being more worried than benefited by going, it would be out of the question." Bryher often set conditions, but Moore had her own conditions, teased back, while admitting that riding elephants and such places as Carthage tantalized her. To evade Bryher, Moore admitted to all sorts of faults, of having "shyness, scepticisms, lethargy and other tiresome qualities." She begged Bryher to "put up with her." Even after her marriage, Bryher tried to coax Moore into adventure abroad (with the ruse of a typing assignment); as Moore writes, "cables from Winifred Ellerman this week. One, 'please come secretary summer' the other 'come summer'" (to John Warner Moore, May 3, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 157). To Bryher, she refused such "musical therapeutics," and framed her position both dramatically and ambiguously: "I should not like at this time to leave the library unless it were to save a life or unless the situation here, for me, were so unbearable that by staying there wouldn't be anything of me left to go when I did want to go" (May 3, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 158). This was a convoluted way of expressing that it was choice and obligation that kept her at the library and at home, and only the most drastic circumstances could take her away; still she left the door open for wanting "to go" at some point, a confession held up in a letter the following <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  week, also dramatically expressed: "I am only too eager to be in England this minute but I cannot come before next year even if by that time it should be too late" (May 9, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 159).</p>
<p>In her novelistic version, Nancy taunts: "You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Sitting here like a pterodactyl on a rock afraid to move. I suppose you feel that if you fell off it into the sea you'd enjoy swimming among the anemones" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 150). Anne's response, like Moore's in real life, rejects Nancy's proposition: "'I should like to come with you,' Anne's eyes were bright, 'but it is not possible.'" Perhaps with some self-mocking, Bryher parses Anne's reply from Moore's letters: "'Your kindness is gratifying that you wish me to be with you. But if I am to write a novel it may not be for some years. I know I am not ready. You see,' Anne cut in two a large black mushroom slowly, 'I feel if I am to create anything I shall do it when I am, say, forty-five'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 148).</p>
<p>Moore had written provocatively to her brother: "When there are no strangers about she is most sprightly. Piggy [Moore's name for McAlmon] has a bad crush on [Bryher] . . . Winifred wants Mole and me to go over to England with them for the trip and to spend a month or two. She tried most of one evening to get me to promise to take a check for a Mediterranean trip as soon as she got it from her father. She said, 'Dactyl if you don't take it delicately with <span style="font-style:italic;">a swish of your tail</span> it will be very awkward. You see my father wants to encourage me to get rid of money'" (February 13, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 143, emphasis added). The date is significant: "Piggy" courted Bryher, while Bryher courted "Dactyl." Moore knew from Bryher that her father planned to bring Bryher back to England, but she was flabbergasted when the next day at her tea party, H.D. and Bryher announced that the "ceremony" at City Hall with McAlmon had taken place a couple hours before. Moore called this the "worst event" of a busy two weeks, a veritable "earthquake" (to John Warner Moore, February 20, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 144). For Moore, the marriage short-circuited what had been developing between the pair over the few months preceding, what can only be called a collaborative and transferential romance lacking a literal kiss or consummation.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, with her menagerie about to cast off for Europe, the purportedly "real marriage" with McAlmon is elided, while Bryher's imprecations for Moore to abandon her virginal existence constitute the book's emotional core. New York is all imagist clarity: "In the February morning the city became sharp as a photographic plate magnified many times. [. . .] The tallest skyscraper become a point on the horizon. The waves beat more swiftly, the sea was before them. Europe lay eastward; ready for rediscovery" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 191). In the chapter of lunching on mushrooms and pistachio, Nancy tries to woo the Dactyl by praising this very photographic ability in her: "And nobody else can make those hard little photographs. Of elephants and coral reefs. You ought to come and catalogue Europe before all the beauty of it disappears" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, 148-9). The Dactyl remains the anchor point of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> with the very writing of the book a kind of seduction plot. Although it ends with dissatisfaction, the book offers a tantalizing model of inter-subjective transference. As if completing this courtship at a later date in an "especial" romance, Moore eventually sent Bryher a provocative lock of her hair.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Continuing a dialogue with Bryher's description of her <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  as shell on a rock, and after Bryher's abrupt marriage, Moore was "impatient" to see <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>: "You are by no means off the rock; nor shall a husband share it with us" (May 9, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 159). Thus Moore placed herself in the scene Bryher had depicted, and then superimposed Bryher with her on the "Jurassic rock" surrounded by sea anemones; there was no room for a husband. Even after the marriage, she would sign her letters with either "loving" or "affectionately" and "Dactyl"; by 1932, the signature cooled to merely initials.</p>
<p>When Bryher, McAlmon, H.D., and Perdita returned to Europe as a new ménage in 1921, it was as if Bryher had lived out several lifetimes. This period represented an extraordinary set of interpersonal and creative revolutions. What can these overlapping triangles tell us about the unique creative processes of these poets at this cultural moment of "homosexual panic" that motivates in part the rich daughter (really a boy) to marry the bohemian bisexual poet, McAlmon, rather than remain in the awkward position of "companion" to H.D. and proto-lover to Moore? Bryher's marriage, oddly conservative in light of her simultaneous efforts to wrench Moore from her "narrow limits," was a concession to her parents as well as a stratagem to pursue yet another vision of creative co-operation—to give McAlmon an allowance for travel to Paris, and at the same time, to retain her own autonomy. This "experiment" ran parallel to her "impossible" relationship with the erotically independent Moore. He became a surrogate for the evasive Dactyl.</p>
<p>For their part, Bryher's parents were delighted to have a son-in-law to supplement Bryher's "queer" relationship—though they probably didn't detect the queerness in Bryher's friendship with Moore. Moore wrote H.D.: "I have just had a letter from Bryher which makes me very happy. She says her father and mother are pleased with Robert and I hope they are. Perhaps I exaggerate the momentousness of marriage" (March 27, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 149). Moore took pleasure in the family's obliviousness: "I can only smile very ironically at Robert's harmonizing so nicely with the family, in his adaptability to Perdita." By late March, Moore was still trying to make the best of the inconvenient marriage; she imagined Piggy's new wardrobe, deflecting erotic feeling through the bond she shared with Bryher—a love of men's clothing:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The sample, nipped from your belt, is beautiful—the color, and I like the peculiar, napless feel of it. I thought when you were here, that perhaps black velvet and gray Japanese silk would be becoming to you, or some shade of blue but when I saw your pink pongee with the embroidered pockets, I saw that you ought to wear deep pink or have a little of it on anything you wear. Old gold has an irresistible attraction for me; so has orange. . . . I wish I could see Robert's ties, suits and riding-breeches. Enthralled as I am by women's clothes I am much more enthralled by men's</p>
<div class="attrib">(to Bryher, March 28, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Moore's most immediate outward expression about the marriage was concern over Bryher's emotional state. Of Piggy, she wrote, "I am still shocked by him. Anyone who is so ignorant as not to know that he was doing Bryher an irreparable injury by doing as he did, is not fit to marry her" (to H.D., March 27, 1921, <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 149). Alternately, she lamented: "There is no such thing as a prudent marriage; marriage is a Crusade; there <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is always tragedy in it; in the case of one with so finely adjusted a mechanism as Bryher, one's spiritual motive power is sure to receive a backset." By 1923, she could memorialize her various affective responses in "Marriage" through a collage aesthetic.</p>
<p>Moore's many comments on Bryher's marriage reflect her understanding of the "motive" of such beards, but also her hurt, and moreover, her sense of abandonment on the collaborative "Jurassic rock." Further, her reactions are difficult to disentangle from the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>, five months after Bryher's taking Piggy as groom. Produced by a triumvirate (Bryher, H.D. and McAlmon), the collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> was not, at its birth, what Moore wanted. Moore understood the collaborating trio (especially Bryher) admired and also infantilized her by arranging publication without her involvement and consent. Collaboration as a form of negative transference, as this set of aesthetic-emotional details represent, has a murky side.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">"<span style="font-style:italic;">Your now naked</span> Dactyl": <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> and the Marketing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>
</h1>
<p>It is seldom noted that in reviewing <span style="font-style:italic;">Development</span> and purveying <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure,</span> Moore took on the role of ambassador for Bryher; at the same time, she used the opportunity to point out Bryher's hastiness in publication. In November of 1920, two months after their meeting, a reciprocal offer of help seemed purely business: she thanked Bryher "for all [her] care in telling [her] of modern English writers" while advising her to send one of her essays to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dial</span> or to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yale Review</span>, though she wasn't sure of their editorial policy (November 29, 1920; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 135-7). This letter, after sharing her kindred dislike of dolls as "the dreariest, tawdriest things in the world," Moore closed with gratitude: "Thank you for looking after my interest in the matter of the essays. Do, if I am not burdening you, secure me anything you can." Both thus conceived of each other as capable of creating venues for their writing, another stitch in the collaborative skein. By December, when <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> was inaugurated, the exchange took on stronger emotional nuances, including Moore's fear of having her friend rejected, and subsequently in the following year, her own sense of being chaperoned too strongly in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>.</p>
<p>As Moore's letters testify, her "no" did not mean a "yes," as Cyrena N. Pondrom conjectures.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Moore's resulting sense of disempowered vulnerability as "your now naked Dactyl" (her closing), presented a vivid self-comparison for one so enamored of armor and fur. The trio, we may consider, were making an effort, albeit a clumsy one, to consolidate an aesthetic vision, and claim Moore as "one of their own" apart from the more entrenched the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dial</span>, which gave Moore in 1924 its top award for <span style="font-style:italic;">Observations</span>, hosting fifty-three poems (some written after 1921) plus index and notes, while the premature publication had less than half the number. While representative of a concrete, not entirely successful, product of another collaboration, <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> took place on a transferential sphere, with Bryher projecting her own desires to "assist" Moore while shoring up her own psychic investment in modernist poetry and the Dactyl in particular. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Moore asked to read all of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> in May 1921, and by July (the same month as the fateful publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>), the poet took it around to various houses. At the same time, Moore undoubtedly felt the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> both rash and generous. She wrote T.S. Eliot that she "felt that it was no literary advantage to publish this work but Miss Bryher had been so optimistic as to disagree" (July 15, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 171); to her brother, she reiterated her preference <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> to be published "now that the thing is out as much as I did before" (July 10, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 170).</p>
<p>Moore began her long letter of July 7, 1921, as a feat in transference itself (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 164-7). After laying out her criticisms of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, she explained: "I have pounced on these details for <span style="font-style:italic;">I think it is not good for an artist to be hurried" (SL</span>, 164; emphasis added). Depicting herself as "<span style="font-style:italic;">a pterodactyl with no rock in which to hide</span>", "a Darwinian gosling," "a variety of pigeon that is born naked without any down whatever," Moore expanded upon Bryher's name of her and conveyed her dismayed vulnerability: "I wouldn't have the poems appear now if I could help it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 164; emphasis added). In effect undermining the whole venture, she admitted: "the product is remarkably innocuous." Moore was "very much touched by the beauty of all the printing details" and the "unstinted care" in the "outlay," yet her own compositional care had been foreshortened (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 164). Archly, she requested that Bryher give Harriet Monroe notice of "this opus" even though, as she critically observed, nothing had been reprinted from the 1915 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span>. The July letter's introductory paragraph ended with the oblique but telling, "Poor Hilda!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 165). Seeming to veer away from her hairless condition, she claimed "[t]o turn to more important matters." If <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> was meant as a kind of "auxiliary ego-ideal," on Bryher's side, to consolidate her relationship to Moore, the edition was mirrored back as a less than ideal version of how Moore perceived her progeny. With the sense that a book functions as an extension of a self if not an armature, in an aggressive swerve, Moore's letter then noted Macmillan's turning down <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>; the editor, she reported, had "said he was convinced that if the book appeared in its present form it would not be out two months before [Bryher] would regret having published it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 165). This parry anticipated other defensive strategies—first, a whole paragraph to her first impressions of Hilda and "her bedrock reliability"; and then, in a catalogue of books she has read, her reference to Frank Parson's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Psychology of Dress</span>, underscoring Moore's felt nakedness (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 165). She elucidated: "[t]he cocoon style with small waist and two or three yards of ruffled train (I explain this, my dear baby dactyl as you would not remember)" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 166). Bryher had apparently forgotten Moore's desire to be "cocooned" until ready. Moore reveals a "ruffled" sense of being infantilized as "gosling," a process she reverses by dubbing Bryher "baby dactyl" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 166).</p>
<p>Indeed the whole letter, traversing multiple subjects, can't get away from its initial image of the naked gosling, unready for flight. The particular jumps and omissions that so invigorate Moore's epistolary style reveal an unsettled yet revealing emotional score. Describing her visit to the Bronx zoo to see "a white snake with pink eyes," she informed: "[I]t eats mice without any fur" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 166). There is no transition between her observation that she "think[s] macaws should not be kept in a wire-enclosed field" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and her return to the letter's core subject: "As for Hilda's part in gathering the poems, I am too much in awe to be articulate; I cannot grasp the benevolence and compassing of the whole enterprise and Robert too, is prodigious" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 167). Indeed, she "cannot grasp" the part played by each collaborative player, though she knew Bryher's money backed the "enterprise." After a series of jumps in subject, her signature laid all bare: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Your now naked</span>, Dactyl" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 167). In this context, nakedness could only be vexingly pleasurable, yet it evidences the basis of considering Bryher and Moore's relationship as friendship riddled with transference. Her postscript complicated matters: "I should like to be very decent to Miss Weaver (at Egoist Press) but so far have ordered only ten copies. I don't know what to do with these and don't know what to do next" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 167). The copies are excessive, unwanted "editions," poor reflections of what Moore envisaged; yet Moore understood the flirtatious, generous, and even aggressive intentions motivating Bryher. As if to reinsert herself back into the Dactyl's intimate ground, Bryher's response, to essentially being blamed for going over Moore's head in publishing <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>, was to send a cedar bear to add to the poet's menagerie. Moore named it after its giver, "W. Bryher" and reports that "[i]ts inquisitive nose is very affectionately and respectfully received by the other animals and its little dagger teeth and curling tongue tip are a profound source of admiration" (July 27, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 173). Bryher had also sent one of Robert's letters as another token of confidential connection; the letter, Moore wrote, she would not speak of, and commented: "Also I like his not saying anything when I reproached him for a hasty marriage" (July 27, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 173).</p>
<p>In August, Moore informed Bryher that she would take the "revised" <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> back to the rejecting Macmillan (August 31, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 178). "I have not read the new version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> as it has just come. But what I should like to do is to take it back to Macmillan. . . . My choice of publishers is as follows: Macmillan, Doran, Knopf, Huebsch. As for commission, no compensation would induce me to take the manuscript anywhere <span style="font-style:italic;">if I did not wish to take it</span> and if I took ten manuscripts a month about for you, I should not feel that you were under any obligation" (August 31, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 179; emphasis added). This letter is signed "albino-dactyl," suggesting some color has been drained from her. Oddly, Moore both expressed her belief in the manuscript and duly reciprocated for the imprudent publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span> as well as for Bryher's "hasty" marriage to "Piggy." In her report in November 1921, Doran rejected <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> and so the devoted Moore "took it at once to Knopf" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 181).</p>
<p>In another turn of the screw, Harriet Monroe quoted Bryher in a review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems; "[Poems</span>] is the study of a Marco Polo detained at home. It is the fretting of a wish against wish . . ."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> In the context of their prior correspondence, Bryher sounds a bit like a spurned lover. Her highest compliment of this "triumphant book" makes Moore a masculine woman, setting her outside the Genteel school: "The spirit is robust, that of a man with facts and countries to discover and not that of a woman at tapestries. But something has come between the free spirit and its desire" . (This echoes a line in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, which Moore had already seen: "Anne sat back in her chair, a Marco Polo stayed at home, twisted to silence by some strange repression"; 37). Clearly, personal feeling has come between the critic's perception and Moore's work, given her role in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the publication. It is as if Moore's development was, in Bryher's mind, still repressed and sidetracked from adventures.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Burying the Bones: 1922-1923</h1>
<p>It is striking that Bryher offered Moore a "writing fellowship" in 1921 and 1922 so that the latter could travel—apparently with her—to distant parts; what is more striking is the manner in which Moore refused it. The pair would continue to read each other's work and help where possible, so that in the "cooling off" period of this literary infatuation, Moore once more assured Bryher: "I am indeed glad to take care of ADVENTURE" (April 25, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>). Bryher would send Moore multiple gifts, and as she did for others, very often with an extremely sensitive eye for the actual desires of the recipient. In March, she sent Moore "collars," a classic garment in Moore's outfits (recall the line from <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>: "[h]er austere boyish head, her flushed face about the prim white collar was vivid with excitement.") Here is how Moore responded, after informing Bryher she was then wearing one of the collars given her: "You are very indomitable in your vicarious collecting of choice possessions. Mother says <span style="font-style:italic;">I bury every bone beyond recovery</span>; these I shall keep above ground. I have had such pleasure in wearing the collar and it gratifies me to have your gift admired over and over" (June 13, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>; emphasis added). A collar is of course a resonant item, suggestive of submission. But does her poignant response suggest that Moore hides most all her love objects—all the "bones" she has savored, and most of the love offerings that have given her pleasure?</p>
<p>She returned the writing scholarship, as I said, even as she appreciated the evidence it bestowed. The money put Bryher's affection into intelligibility. Moore began her letter of June 26 with acknowledgment of what Bryher "gave as a sort of guarantee of leisure for writing"; she then asked the benefactor to find a more suitable recipient:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[the fund] ought to be used by someone who would justify your application of it and from your letters I know that you constantly come upon such artists. My processes are inherently different from the usual ones. Traveling hinders my work and doesn't help it; nevertheless I want to take the trip west that we are just starting on. [. . .] Therefore I have transferred the three hundred dollars to you, opening an account in your name in the bank where it has been since you gave it to me. They will send you a pass book and card for your signature, and while you may be for the moment deeply disappointed [. . .] you will have large consolation in the fact that the possession of it has been a true enrichment to me; <span style="font-style:italic;">without its actuality, I could not have known so well as I do, the strength of your friendship, its solidity and dependability</span>.</p>
<div class="attrib">(June 26, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>; emphasis added).</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This act of setting up a bank account for a wealthy woman announced Moore's piquant ethics and desire to read affection apart from money, even if it was ratified by it. Moore and her mother left for Seattle July 3 to visit "Badger" who was then stationed as a Navy Chaplain nearby, and where the poet would write her great "Octopus," inspired by Mt. Rainier<span style="font-weight:bold;">.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></span> Traveling to Seattle was Moore's escape hatch (to some extent) from Bryher's intense imprecations; she did, however, correspond with Bryher during this <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  period, once to reinforce that she did not usually mix travel with writing, and another to praise the release of Bryher's <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrow Music</span> , poems with traces of Bryher's passion for both H.D. and Moore.</p>
<p>To further bolster Moore's rejection of Bryher's "fund," Mary Warner Moore wrote her daughter's admirer while in Seattle<span style="font-weight:bold;">:</span> "Is it not a reasonable thing for her to put back your keeping the beautiful 'scholarship' you conferred that memorable New York visit?" She adds of the projected "Syrian trip": "I wish that I had youth and health to throw myself into the breach to do for you just what I should so gladly do for Marianne, were she wishing to take the trip you are to take—that is, were you and she taking it together. But Marianne herself has no facility in that sort of forging forward—" (July 24, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>). The same infantilizing letter underscored that Bryher should not make "Marianne [her] personal conductor" and that "secretary work is back breaking" (this in reply to Bryher's off-hand somewhat absurd attempt to "employ" Moore if she could not get her to travel otherwise) and "hard for one so frail," concluding that Moore's job at the library with its four and half hour shift was "enough." Moore's mother acted as conductress here, blocking Bryher's manifold plots to have the Dactyl near her. These plots were foiled, yet the monetary layer in Bryher's courtship reflected (as it deflected) the erotic longing present in the pair's aesthetic exchange. Not every bone was buried without recovery.</p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>In the same time frame of Bryher's intense entrancement with Moore between late 1920 and 1921 (underscored in <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> and their correspondence), Bryher hoped matrimony would grant her the respectability she needed to go on with her queer ménage with H.D. and Perdita, giving her freedom from parental domination. Unhappily, she and McAlmon were treated poorly by the press, which reduced him to a fortune hunter, hanging on to Bryher as masculine benefactor traveling with a "wife" (H.D.), who had an illegitimate child and who was estranged from her husband. Even if she might have taken the marriage as a semi-affront considering the coincident courtship unfolding between herself and Bryher, none of the "queerness" of such an arrangement would have been lost on Moore. Moore's "Marriage" of 1923 reflects this, given that Bryher red as the provocative Eve ("so handsome /she gave me a start"). The poem appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Manikin</span>, a journal brought out by Monroe Wheeler, who lived with Glenway Wescott in a "domestic" relationship. According to Moore, they were "able to maintain a relationship true to the spirit of marriage without the benefit of social contract" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 464). Further placing her within the fabric of the age of inversion, Moore (as Willis points out) drew upon Ellis's <span style="font-style:italic;">On Life and Sex</span> in her depiction of marriage as "Crusade" both in letters to Bryher and H.D., and then in her poem "Marriage." (Again, as with <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span>, fact and fiction blur.)</p>
<p>Moreover, Moore wrote Bryher in 1922 with usual equivocation: "I like Havelock Ellis so much that I am perhaps too eager to find something new in what he writes . . . " Moore's associative eagerness is both occluding and revealing; in reading Ellis' <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  injunction "to persevere," she thought of Trollope: "'for love that will gaze an eagle blind, that is a Hercules still climbing the trees in the garden of the Hesperides, forty-five to seventy is the best age. Up to that time men are merely flirting,' but perhaps that makes some seem willing to tease and I don't mean to be flippant" (March 22, 1922; <span style="font-style:italic;">BL</span>). Is she suggesting here—or rather confessing—her own teasing disposition towards Bryher and affirming her commitment to bachelorhood? The quote from Trollope reappeared in "Marriage," thus situating Ellis as a mediating strand within Moore's inverted relationship to Bryher (with the respectable Trollope as screen). She thereby reasserted her defense of "merely flirting." Further, Moore was not naïve about lesbian pairings: Moore recommended, for instance, Stein's "Miss Furr and Miss Skeene," and in the same letter of 1923, expressed envy of Man Ray's photo of Bryher (to Bryher, July 5, 1923; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 200-1). She was also not naïve about her choice <span style="font-style:italic;">not to marry</span>. However muted, she made several things clear: she had been flirting, she had been disappointed in Bryher's marriage, and she was a bachelor who had temporarily entertained the overtures of the butch shipping heiress. The strong erotic undertones in her letters to Bryher were finally abstracted in the poem "Marriage."</p>
</div>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>In this period, both Bryher and Moore (alone and together) crystallized and joined aesthetic with erotic goals; they reflected upon geographic and familial identity; they worried about publication as it hinged upon gender. <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> itself commemorated Bryher's arc of arriving in America, meeting Moore, touring the country and then reuniting with the poet. Strikingly, Bryher would later repudiate <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> turned <span style="font-style:italic;">West</span> in 1925 (as if incorporating Moore's criticism of it as hurried, and then burying it); indeed, the book comes early in Bryher's writing career, yet the novel/memoir lucidly portrays Bryher taking Moore into her modernist imaginary and vice versa.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> At the same time, Bryher's relationship to Moore is an exercise in literary collaboration as transference.</p>
<p>The publication relationship presented in this article is a detail in a much larger cultural mosaic of Bryher's life as "female husband" to modernism; she is a kind of female Pound, considering her multilingual internationalism and multiple acts of shepherding other artists (other than H.D., Moore was the first "official" writer to whom Bryher offered a writing fund). When Pound visited H.D. in 1920 and found Bryher alone in their apartment, he pronounced her quite dull; she shared the same view of him. Moore recounted to her brother about Bryher's meeting Ezra: "Bryher said, 'I let him in; I thought it was the bread or the potatoes and I was very sorry I had. He talked to me an hour about a Saxon king and a Danish chief and <span style="font-style:italic;">how one wanted to carry off the other's wife</span> and things went on till but one was left. He said afterward I didn't stand up very well without H.D'" (February 13, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 143; emphasis added). Pound's anecdote about the exchange of wives signals the patriarchal control artists like H.D., Moore and Bryher faced. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In November 1921, Moore wrote to H.D. and Bryher jointly regarding a review in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>, comparing herself to Edna St. Vincent Millay and Anna Wickham as women who "'contracted marriages with wit'" (as though contracting an illness) and "committed themselves to careers of brains"; "'Moore,' the critic continued, 'one admits right away, must best be taken for worse. She wedded wit, but after divorces from beauty and sense'" (to Hilda and Bryher, November 10, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 181-2). Moore's quotation from the review raises prominent questions about marriage and divorce in the modernist period. Unlike H.D. or Bryher who married for diverse reasons, Moore herself never married and lived with her mother after college as a kind of "couple" until Mary Warner Moore died in 1947. However, Moore was aroused by Bryher, and participated in a flirtatious attachment to the self-described "girl-page," a scenario that somewhat explains Moore's excessive disappointment in Bryher's marriage as well as her protective response—she worried that "it was an outrage for anyone to marry Winifred Bryher in such a style so unromantic" (to John Warner Moore, April 4, 1921; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 152). Moore saw through the compulsory convenience of the marriage, but probably could not fully sympathize with Bryher's capitulation to the "heterosexual/homosexual binary." The invocation of "marriages with wit" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span> review also suggests the way women writers, alone or unmarried, (or as Leavell frames it in Moore's case, celibate or committed to a mother/daughter relationship), are held accountable along the axis of heterosexual romance.</p>
<p>It is not surprising then that collaboration as a form of transference needs further refinement in cases where women (or men) do not fit within expected relationships; there are many degrees of affective and intellectual kinships forged where contracts are not available (nor even desirable) for solidifying them. In the case of Bryher and Moore, the literal encounters between them were brief, but their relationship was long and significant, layered and nautilus-like: they steadily corresponded, commented upon each other's writing, and wrote about each other (Moore wrote reviews of Bryher's novels in the 1950s and 1960s). By the late 1920s, Moore would accept a steady allowance (what Bryher referred to as "covenant") which kept Moore and her mother afloat through the Great Depression and beyond, up to Moore's death in 1972. Bryher also continued to send gifts, a stream of mad money for broaches, clothing, and other artifacts that caught Moore's eye. As further evidence of exchange, Bryher published Moore in her cinema journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span> (the poet reviewed, among other things, the lesbian 1930 cult classic, <span style="font-style:italic;">Maedchen in Uniform</span>); Bryher would continue to take tips from Moore about films, discuss politics and mutual friends, visit her when in New York, but 1920-1923 remains the apex of their romantic collaboration.</p>
<p>The very concept of collaboration as transference I conclude demands refashioning to accommodate Bryher's modernist circle, of which Moore was central. Georgina Taylor has posited an "intersubjective" counter-public sphere that flourished among women modernists between 1913 and 1946 (with H.D. at the center) where "new ideas emerged through a process of interaction" primarily through the little magazines.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> Yet I suggest that even when "intersubjectivity" enters the question of collaboration, the homo-emotional and/or erotic dimension often goes missing, especially in cases like <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Bryher's—who often passes as only patron, rather than full-fledged collaborator; and in cases like Moore's—who is often dubbed asexual, with her poems fulfilling the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span> reviewer's implication that she suffers from lack of <span style="font-style:italic;">real</span> conjugal union.</p>
<p>Bryher's transference with Moore reads like an attempt to act out an earlier self when being a boy seemed possible—a facsimile of frustrated longing she was still in the process of re-creating when she met Moore, who could allow her to act out her own male enterprising, testing the waters of her ability to express desire and take masculine roles outside her family. According to Schafer, the analyst in a transference scenario provides the "[c]ondition of the convincing, sustained readiness of those who are loved to contain one's more or less projective assaults on them, to tolerate the role of bad breast or phallus, arbitrary authority or violation of some other kind, and to endure being abandoned" ("Conditions for Loving," 408). Further, "having met this condition for loving, the analyst [again Moore and Bryher take turns in my case] is loved gratefully as a good mother, father, breast, womb, phallus, friend, and analyst. Not all at once, of course, and not once and for all, and not altogether, for this is only part of the work" ("Conditions for Loving," 408). Ambivalence and doubt are key to the work of transference, and in my mind, also to collaboration, where the old and new become "blurred, and "meaning is multifaceted"; we enter a territory where "one has found and accepted a new mode of experiencing one's self and one's world, which is to say, asserting a transformation to one's own subjectivity" ("Conditions for Loving," 409, 415).</p>
<p>Building upon Freud's notion of creating a new "edition" of the self, transformation takes place, according to Schafer, through the "psychology of metaphor," where some experiences can only be expressed metaphorically. In poems as in collaborative transference, "[m]etaphor is a new experience rather than a mere paraphrase of an already fully constituted experience. The metaphor creates an experience that one has never had before. It is an experience one has not realized by oneself. . . . it is a creation rather than a mere paraphrase or new edition" ("Conditions for Loving," 415). Metaphor—in the exchange between Bryher and Moore—was loaded: Bryher becomes Moore's publisher, her father, her rescuer, her child, her super-ego, her comrade, her usurper, even her seducer (and vice versa), across the course of their most intense interactions. Moore is Pterodactyl of the fish age, and Bryher is overweening adventurer who needs reining in; later, Moore's "edition" of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems</span>, turns into an assault that tests the limits of love, which appears to survive, even while the tenor of it necessarily changed. For Bryher and Moore, money and gifts became metaphoric monikers of personal and poetic value: can money transcend value of self or creativity? Can one "take" a gift without shame? Can one give it without shame? Can Bryher give it as a means of identification with her powerful shipping magnate father, and then transform this identity within the context of Moore's measures and gratitude? Can one gain purchase over the intangibles of an erotic connection, amidst the swirl of indeterminate nomenclature of female bachelors, of inverts, of queers? Transference, as I redefine it, is a kind of collaboration where "reference" travels between selves, and is not confined to a single text or "edition." In this essay's close up of Bryher's early "coercion" and urging of Moore, her writing <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Adventure</span> and wanting to have it too, along with Moore's little-known promotion of the book, begin to elucidate the projections, introjections and subtle intimacies of modernist collaboration as transference.</p>

As to Bryher's primary role in the journals she engineered and edited, she did participate in her own erasure by making sure others received more credit: in the instance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span>, she gave Macpherson centrality, though creating the first film journal in English was certainly the brain-child of <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> Bryher and Macpherson; with <span style="font-style:italic;">Life &amp; Letters</span>, she occluded herself almost entirely, although Moore, for instance, herself wrote the emerging poet Elizabeth Bishop to send her manuscripts directly to Mrs. Macpherson (September 8, 1935; <span style="font-style:italic;">SL</span>, 353). The editor in chief of <span style="font-style:italic;">Life &amp; Letters</span>, appointed by Bryher, was Robert Herring, and he certainly deserves much credit; at the same time, Bryher asked her name not to be on the masthead although she worked closely with Herring in his selections.</p></div>

Bryher was in analysis with Hanns Sachs from the mid-twenties up through his death in 1947. Bryher sent H.D. to Freud for analysis for sessions in 1933 and 1934, studied to be a lay-analyst, immersed herself in the period's psychoanalytic writings and attended psychoanalytic congresses. Thus, Bryher's relationships must be considered in light of her own sense of the overwhelming cultural significance of psychoanalysis. H.D. had certainly read Freud before meeting Bryher; likewise, Bryher knew Freud's work well before meeting Moore. Moore, on the other hand, didn't have any great faith in psychoanalysis. Still the language of projection, transference, and the incipient field of object relations, inspired by Freud and expanded through James Strachey and Anna Freud up to contemporary theorists like Jessica Benjamin, are useful in thinking about Moore and her modernist circle.</p></div>

The headlines called attention to the queerness of her female companion (H.D.), the model turned poet (McAlmon) calling him in many articles a fortune hunter, and casting her as the mannish Winifred. The articles hint rather loudly at the threesome's queerness.</p></div>
