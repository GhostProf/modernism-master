<h1 class="sec-headA">I</h1>
<p>
	I was told what happened this spring at one of the Moscow exhibitions. In a secluded room, a young woman started crying hysterically in front of a painting depicting a beautiful island in the middle of calm seas, a haven of love and beauty. Surprising and terrible were those real tears in front of a golden-framed painting which had nothing upsetting in itself. The organiser of the exhibition, K., a nice and friendly person, tried to calm the young lady. She kept repeating through tears: “Blood, blood, blood everywhere... <span style="font-style:italic;">but here</span> it feels so good.” Then the reason for her weakness became understandable. She had been to Poland, had seen a lot, had read the newspapers daily but precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">here</span>, in front of a painting, the thought of the inadequacy between the “blood” and the most cherished human dreams struck her with a particular violence. Undeniably, at this very moment, the colour-covered canvas in a golden frame won a great victory!
      </p>
<p>
	People might say: the young woman was naïve and sentimental. But doesn’t truth disclose itself to children, didn’t a child denounce the lies of the king in Andersen’s story? The young woman was moved by the genuine mission of art: a plea for human and humanist beauty, for the azure kingdom, for the kingdom of God. Of course art ceases to be art when it preaches  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> this plea; but it achieves its highest vocation when its unknown energies succeed to inspire will for life, faith in life. Nothing is hideous to such art, religious in its very nature; it unveils the wonderfully human in the typically human. Nothing is inanimate to such art; it perceives a soul in every “dead” thing.
      </p>
<p>
	Yet how far is this kind of art from the present-day futurism with its cult of the painterly <span style="font-style:italic;">bric-à-brac</span>* and its “ferro-concrete” poems!
      </p>
<p>
	There was a time, at the beginning of the war, when it seemed that a return to futurism was not possible, that it had dissipated as a bad dream. For the everyday reality with its death-propelling airplanes, its floating mines, its far-firing monsters, and its suffocating gases turned out to be more “futurist” than anything Marinetti’s most frenzied and militant fantasies could have dreamt of when he was glorifying war as the “world’s only hygiene.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Moreover, the very destruction of the monuments of the old art, to which the first futurist manifesto was appealing with the hotheadedness of the youth, did not only became a military event but even found a particular kind of ideological defence on the side of the most zealous and old-fashioned explorers of the past, the German <span style="font-style:italic;">Gelehrters</span>.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the face of the sorrowful ruins of the Reims cathedral, this first embodiment of a futurist act, this triumph of technology, yesterday’s verbal and artistic futurism seemed like childish stammering or, on the contrary, like worn-out “passéism.” Indeed, how could Marinetti’s “telegraphic lyricism” and battle onomatopoeias or Kamensky’s ferro-concrete poems compete with the genuine ferroconcrete poem of the most recent war?
      </p>
<p>
	It seemed that the time had come for a change of minds, that the roar of the military events would deafen the militant verbosity of our youth. For it could now have a glimpse at the “future” it was dreaming about: a future of bare physical strength and deified, soulless machine, a future of lightning-quick and ubiquitous speed... It seemed that our youth, saddened and ashamed, would come back to what it was burning before—the human being [<span style="font-style:italic;">čelovek</span>]—, to its eternal ideal—a beautiful soul and a beautiful body; that the “blood” spilled over “there” would not have been worthless but expiatory and purificatory blood; that the military thunder, calming down after the destruction, would give birth to a new conscience. For war is often part of the force that creates good while wishing the evil...
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II</h1>
<p>
	Yet—alas!—everything remained the same. The Burliuk and the Mayakovsky have clung to their positions; Larionov went to the front and came back unchanged. The exhibition “The Year 1915” arranged by Kandaurov in the Moscow Art Salon with the interesting aim to provide an objective image of contemporary painting, became a true bacchanalia of every variety of futurism. Actually, there were also some other trends at the exhibition. The works by the members of the “Knave of Diamonds” group seem already quite insipid next to all that ensued: Konchalovsky’s huge carpet project, Mashkov’s colourful, juicy fruits, Falk’s intimate landscapes and Kuprin’s pretty stilllives. Altman, Mrs. Tolstaia, Latri, Obolenskaia, Khodasevich, and especially the young  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> painter from Vitebsk, Mark Chagall—they all have some good things. But all this is deafened by the yelling actions of the futurists that weaken the beholder’s ability to perceive anything else.
      </p>
<p>
	Until now we were acquainted with “cubism” and “futurism” as a particular system of treating lines and colours on canvas. We were acquainted with Kandinsky’s “musical painting” which sought to arouse in the viewer this or that musical sensation by ways of mere coloured arabesques; this attempt was at least theoretically grounded. We had seen pasted paper labels on canvas as well as mosaics of gaudy coloured bits of fabric (“simultanism”) and it seemed that the laughster-artists<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> had little to surprise us with.
      </p>
<p>
	But this time the Muscovites did not stick to pasting. Larionov judged that it was insufficient, too unambiguous and elementary to paste scraps from theatrical posters on the portrait of Natalia Goncharova, reminding the audience of her participation in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Coq d’or*</span> and in “The Fan.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> He decided that he <span style="font-style:italic;">could do without the canvas</span> and show the audience some real things, joyfully coloured or even in their natural state. Hence, on his other, paper-made “portrait” of Goncharova, he pasted a real hairdresser’s plait. He then “nailed” some sticks, frames, a hat box, a bottle, bits of spiral-twisted paper, military maps, and newspaper clippings to the wall, painted all this with a brush, and achieved a “plastic rayism,” i.e. emanation of rays and mutual penetration of one object into another. In order to represent an “iron battle,” he took a board, pasted onto it pieces of military maps, candy wrappers and national toy-flags, added a toy house in place of a fortress and some black sticks symbolising cannons, and traced some bloody rivers and mountains in the form of red layers. The result is a “military toy” that any child would make in a much better way, for in the name of the decorative side of the war it would forget about its blood...
      </p>
<p>
	Mayakovsky acted even more simply: he displayed half of his top hat, his black glove, sprayed some black stripes on the wall and called all this a “sole-portrait” [<span style="font-style:italic;">samo-portret</span>]. The work of Tatlin, however—a very talented artist who gave us over the last year some interesting sketches for the performance of “Life for the Tsar”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a>—his work is no longer a <span style="font-style:italic;">bric-à-brac*</span> hastily nailed to the wall and coloured in the very exhibition space. It is a thorough device [<span style="font-style:italic;">sooruženie</span>] that he toiled to “nail” together: a folded iron sheet and half of a glass jar on a [wooden] board coated with plaster—a combination of black, grey, and dirty white shades and “intersecting planes.” Another “plastic still-life” consists of the same board, a chair leg and an S-shaped piece of iron. One ought to observe this junk from a single viewpoint; therefore, the author has drawn on the exhibition floor a sign indicating the place where the beholder should stand. While one might laugh at Larionov’s gaudy-coloured jumble, Tatlin’s austere black-grey-and-white showcase of things does not convey a laugh: too much work has been spent on it! <span style="font-style:italic;">“He nailed the temples with a rusty great.</span>”
      </p>
<p>
	This replacement of the painted still-life with real dead things is, actually, a very logical conclusion to “cubism.” This is cubism brought to its extreme limit, to its absurd. Why represent the volumes of things and the depth of space when one can simply display them by handing over an actual jar and by folding a tinplate sheet in order to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> get the third dimension? Why compose on the palette the different shades of iron, lime, and glass, when one can find them in real iron, plaster and jar?

<p>
	There was a grain of truth in cubism but it was cultured in a totally erroneous way. I mean the ambition to consolidate form and to facet objects, which came as a legitimate reaction against the amorphous and pulverized painting of the impressionists. Cézanne countered Manet’s [sic] de-objectified pictorial mirages with his consolidated—as if cast from rigid mass—res. What guided the brush of Cézanne was not merely the optical irritation of the eye (as in the paintings of the impressionists) but its sensory and motor capacity as well. This two-folded perception of the world, both pictorial and plastic [<span style="font-style:italic;">plastičeskoe</span>], bore in itself a great and healing principle. It returned to painting the <span style="font-style:italic;">feeling of reality</span> that the impressionists had lost; it announced a genuine, organic artistic synthesis—a painting in which the colour and form of things would harmoniously balance each other. Such a painting would be the triumph of the genuinely Latin tradition, the tradition of Poussin, classical in its nature, for classicism is balance and harmony.
      </p>
<p>
	Yet as always, the epigones vulgarised and perverted the idea of their teacher. Cézanne’s words that <span style="font-style:italic;">nature</span> should be rendered through the shapes of sphere, cone, and cylinder led them to the conclusion that one ought to paint only geometrical bodies. Cézanne’s “curvature,” which, as he complained to Bernard, was a flaw of his ageing eye,<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> but which did not prevent his compositions from being solidly built, led them to the conclusion that one ought to displace and curve the lines of all objects. Hence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> appeared the popular theory of “displacement,” of the “penetration” of objects one into another, of the “plastic dynamism”—a theory of the very illusionist impressionism that Cézanne had risen up against. For Cézanne, as a classic, was grounded in the objective idea of an object, in the representation of its volume, and not in this or that impression [of the object], while the “displacement” gives way, indeed, to the subjective arbitrariness of any given painter. Anyone would displace and dismantle objects anyhow! As a result, instead of Cézanne’s solid and monumental world, we’ve attained a new dematerialisation of the world, a new de-objectification of the things. The facets of the plane and the corners have grown into fetishes. In the name of geometry we have forgotten the blood and flesh of Cézanne’s painting—its saturated, resonant and replenishing colour. The paint was replaced by wallpaper and pasted papers. But it was even more consistent to replace the painted cylinders by a glass jar. Cézanne was yearning for the solidity of things—what could be more solid than the thing itself, real iron and glass?

<p>
	This is the logic of madness . . .
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">IV</h1>
<p>
	I already mentioned that the paintings of the “Knave of Diamonds” seem “insipid” today. Yet not so long ago even Konchalovsky’s Van Gogh-influenced paintings seemed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> revolutionary. There was a time when the Sunday visitors to the Shchukin gallery laughed upon Gauguin, while today Gauguin seems to them so undeniable and classical that, without even a halt in front of his wall, they move on to laugh upon Picasso. Shouldn’t we conclude that the works of the “nailers” would appear quite acceptable in a couple of years, just like all those other painterly phenomena that first gave rise to a storm of jokes and complaints? For even if the patriarch of Impressionism Edouard Manet had stated in the manifesto-introduction to his catalogue that he “never wanted to protest,” that he “merely sought to be sincere,”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> we might admit that a certain mood of struggle and protestation as well as a deliberate desire to <span style="font-style:italic;">épater les bourgeois*</span> are inevitable, from a psychological point of view, when a new tendency is about to clear its way. The radicalism of the new that such a tendency brings about is inevitable. Going too far is inevitable. Life has become so complex, there is such an over-production in art that it is difficult to ask modern artists to be as heroically modest as in the good old times. I fully understand the muddled cautiousness of the contemporary beholder who, on the one hand, is anxious not to miss something new and valuable while, on the other hand, fears to look like the fooled subjects of Andersen’s king. The situation is indeed tragicomic.
      </p>
<p>
	But it shouldn’t deprive us of our freedom of judgment nor turn us into “lackeys of the lackey-less.” As Baudelaire said, if “everything beautiful is strange, everything strange is not beautiful.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> For the question is not whether to “drag and not let”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> the new tendency, stab or not stab its samples with a cane, as the Parisian audience had wished at the sight of Manet’s paintings at the Salon des Refusés. No one contests nowadays the freedom of the artist, or the fact that futurism reflects the modern “whirl of ideas” and, as such, is fully understandable from a sociological point of view. The discussion is rather whether <span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> manifestation of the artistic arbitrariness is—or not—worthwhile; whether is or not worthwhile the futurist <span style="font-style:italic;">adoration</span> of those sides of contemporary life that our general cultural conscience wishes to overcome.
      </p>
<p>
	We do not argue over the fact that Tatlin is an able man who has spent a lot of labour in “nailing” his iron-glass work, but contrary to Apollinaire’s statement that “one should judge the work of art upon the quantity of labour supplied in it”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> we believe that the work of art should be judged solely upon its final result.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> And since a combination of iron, glass, and plaster does not evoke in us <span style="font-style:italic;">any</span> human emotion, then the result is un-artistic. Tatlin has fully the right to study the correlation between plaster, glass and tin within his studio, during the creative process; but at the exhibition we are only interested in the creation.
      </p>
<p>
	Similarly, we do not contest the fact that Kamensky’s ferro-concrete poem ([published in] “The Archer”) records his impressions from Constantinople, as such chaotic, scarce, and fugitive impressions and associations come to the mind of every city-dweller when he absorbs the polyphonic diversity of the street; already the Goncourt brothers had taken note of the impressions invading the soul of Cariolis [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] during his trip in the omnibus (<span style="font-style:italic;">Manette Salomon</span>*). But we do have the right to say that this is not a poem but a simple diary, and for that reason its place is not next to real poetry and prose. Moreover, it is thoroughly inappropriate for anyone to read Kamensky’s pocket  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> diary—its entries are too intimate and arbitrary. Why should we care, indeed, about the association that came to Kamensky’s mind at the sight of the mullahs, and how would we guess that the corals are the talisman of the poet who, according to the kind explanation of his commentator Mr. Shemshurin, “believes in such devices.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> By the way, Shemshurin himself was granted to learn these confidential secrets only “thanks to chance.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
	According to Mr. Shemshurin, Kamensky “acts just like Pushkin did” when instead of describing the winter he simply wrote “Winter! The peasant, celebrating...,”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> etc. But Shemshurin is seriously mistaken. Pushkin was much more <span style="font-style:italic;">modest</span> than Kamensky. Pushkin’s “Winter” is an objective image [<span style="font-style:italic;">obraz</span>] that evokes in us a series of shared and necessary associations, while the alphabetic and numeric drawings in Kamensky’s poem are totally random and arbitrary images. Anyone can associate anything with letters and ciphers! This is no longer the “forest of symbols” from Baudelaire’s dream but the impenetrable woodland of allegories. This is no longer the “gradual deciphering of hints” on which rely Mallarmé’s dark sonnets, but an encrypted stenography with no key available. For the key is only in Kamensky’s pocket, and any search for this key would entail digging in a stranger’s pocket.
      </p>
<p>
	Egotism, this infinite absorption in one’s petty self [<span style="font-style:italic;">samovliublennost’</span>]—such is the heavy sin of our artistic youth. Kamensky is convinced that his Constantinopolitan half-sensations have universal human value. Larionov illustrates Goncharova’s portrait with more or less promotional newspaper clippings speaking about her victories, about her ubiquitous “screenniness.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Mayakovsky’s act is even simpler: he displays <span style="font-style:italic;">orbi et urbi*</span> bits of his wardrobe, a top hat and a glove, as “sole-portrait” [<span style="font-style:italic;">samo-portretnye</span>] values, just as in his “poem” he calls himself “a cloud in trousers.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Indeed, contemporary futurists have top hats, gloves and trousers but their soul has evaporated like a cloud.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">V</h1>
<p>
	This petty egotism and evaporation of the soul are not only our youth’s fault but also its tragedy, maddened as it is by the chaos of the metropolis. If some ultra-orthodox historical materialist were to invent the art that would best correspond to the city’s [way of] “being” [<span style="font-style:italic;">bytie</span>], he wouldn’t find any better choice than to invent the futurist “conscience.” It’s true, however, that two conflicting tendencies coexist in the complex, fleeting and lightning-quick life of the city. The first one subjugates the human soul through the glittering dynamism of the street, devastates it as if it was wine that had been going through too many barrels, and turns the human being into a passer-by in life who abides by the <span style="font-style:italic;">credo: homo homini lupus est*</span>. This psychology of every individual passer-by in life leads to the fetishism of chaos and dynamics, to futurist anarchism, and to petty-bourgeois egotism.
      </p>
<p>
	The man of the crowd encrypts his feelings—what does he care if another passer-by will understand them! The man in a derby hat only wears a top hat in order to stand out of the derby crowd, out of the common street “dynamism.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	This is why Lentulov can write publicly, on a painting of his covered with pasted gold stars:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  “This manner of decorating one’s works belongs only to me; any untalented imitation would be subject to cruel prosecution.”
	</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Let it be a joke, but this joke is highly symbolic: it says everything!
      </p>
<p>
	It is fully understandable, from a psychological point of view, why for the individual passer-by who clings to his distinctiveness<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> as to a private property, the painting shouldn’t be part of a decorative whole but a self-sufficient entity; and why it “can be transferred with no consequences from the church to the dining room, from the museum to the dwelling” (Kul’bin<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>). For such a painter totally lacks any feeling of monumentality, any feeling of the indivisible bond between painting and wall. His ideal is no longer the fresco but the self-sufficient study or the personal diary poem <span style="font-style:italic;">an und für sich*</span>. This has always been the case in the eras of individualism, when the feeling of the organic character of life was being lost: the Alexandrian era produced a new, “cabinet” form of bas-relief, the genre medallions, easy-to-carry sculpture that could become a petty-bourgeois “lovely setting.” Such was the result of the incursion of urban “dynamism” into Ancient life.
      </p>
<p>
	But there is another tendency in the city: it makes the human soul more ample, responsive, and understanding; it leads to the feeling of a universal solidarity, to the <span style="font-style:italic;">unanimisme*</span> which the French poet Jules Roman [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] laid at the basis of his poetry of the crowd; to the <span style="font-style:italic;">altruisme</span>* of the scientific poetry of René Ghil, to the socialism of the greatest city-dweller of our days—Verhaeren. More than anyone else, Émile Verhaeren feels the great dynamism of the city, but he is no slave to the machine for he believes that this kingdom has to give way to the kingdom of freedom, when the machine will become the slave of the human being. Whereas for the futurist, the human being is only an addendum to the machine, a spoke in its wheel. Hence N. Goncharova names her paintings: “weaving loom + woman.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Tatlin, the beauty of tin and of the glass cylinder prevails over human beauty, as the artist confessed to me. He impressed me as a deeply sincere person who has lived through a lot of things. “I am no longer interested in anything but form and surface,” he said, while explaining why he was so fond of the intersecting iron, glass, and plaster surfaces. A terrible gust of devastation blew from these words of the artist and from his nailed iron-glass, truly <span style="font-style:italic;">still</span> life.
      </p>
<p>
	It is true that the history of art has had such moments of one-sided concentration on the study of some subordinate discipline. For instance, the Renaissance era was keen on perspective. According to Vasari, Uccello fell into “extravagance and bankruptcy” as a result of his passion for perspective, for geometry. But for the Renaissance painter this research was merely a means to a higher goal: <span style="font-style:italic;">the creation of a painting</span>. Whereas for Tatlin the intersection of planes and corners is a <span style="font-style:italic;">self-goal</span>. It is the truly iron dead-end of the things, the deadening of the soul; it is the devastation of Ivan Karamazov.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">VI</h1>

	The Karamazov effect... I was told that not long before the war, the German art critic Meier-Graefe gave a conference in which he warned the youth against the fashionable trends in painting. In one of his arguments, Meier-Graefe referred to Dostoevsky’s novel, to the Russian formulae “anything is permitted” and “there is no God,” which in his opinion were a factor in the expansion of futurism in painting. It should be noted, however, that the conscientious German, in his hostility against Russian “nihilism,” forgot—inadvertently or on purpose—to tell his audience that besides Mitenka and Ivan the old Karamazov also has a third son: Aliosha!
      </p>
<p>
	But we should not forget him. His very soul was in this naïve young lady who broke into tears in front of a painting. And while I was leaving the exhibition “Year 1915,” feeling completely worn out and weighed down, as if somebody had just “nailed” my temples, I suddenly remembered the existence of this other principle in the Russian soul, from which one can and should expect deliverance and a way out of the iron dead-end. There is a bright, wise, and gentle love for the world and for the human being, and for the sticky spring leaves; it will lead to the blooming of a true Russian painting, as soon as the storms of the war dust away, as soon as the young seeds of a new Russian culture start growing, enlightened by a greater respect for human life and the human person.

	  The original Russian title of the article, which appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Severnye zapiski</span> in July–August 1915 (pages 102–111), is “V železnom tupike (Po povodu odnoi moskovskoi vystavki.” All emphasis throughout the text is Tugendkhol’d’s except for the emphasized words followed by the * sign which refer to French, German, or Latin words used as such in the original Russian text. All notes are mine except for the three author’s notes, which are specifically indicated as such.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f2" href="#f2-text">2. </a>
	  Excerpt from Alexei Kruchenykh’s (1886–1968) poem “Na udel’noi” [On Udel’naia str.], 1915, published in the first issue of the literary and artistic journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Strelec</span> [The Archer], ed. by Aleksandr Belenson : 109. This poem describes with humour the nail-operated withdrawal of an abscess from the head of the narrator. In accordance with Kruchenykh’s understanding of <span style="font-style:italic;">zaum</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">beyonsense</span>, or transrational) poetry, the syntactic rules are neglected, some words are modified, and others are used in inappropriate meanings. The latter applies to the rather colloquial verb <span style="font-style:italic;">gvozdit’</span> which can mean either “to bang, beat, to bang away” or “to repeat, to keep on, to continue stubbornly.” In Kruchenykh’s poem, however, this verb also hints to the noun <span style="font-style:italic;">gvozd’</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">nail</span>), which in Russian does not lead to the verb “to nail.” Tugendkhol’d borrows this ambiguity of <span style="font-style:italic;">gvozdit’</span> (to annoy/to nail) and throughout his article builds it up as a metaphor of the mind-numbing and physically damaging Futurist element.

	    “The failing of which Cézanne most complained was his vision. ‘I see overlapping planes,’ he told me, ‘and sometimes straight lines appear to me to fall.’ These faults, which I was considering as products of his willful disregard, he blamed out on the weakness and bad habits of his vision.” P. [sic] Bernard, Souvenirs sur Paul Cézanne, Paris, 1912. (Here quoted after the English translation: Emile Bernard. “Memories of Paul Cézanne” [<span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure de France, 1907</span>] in Michael Doran, ed., <span style="font-style:italic;">Conversations with Cézanne</span> [Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 2001], 78.)

	    Allusion to a quote from Baudelaire’s “Exposition Universelle, 1855”: “<span style="font-style:italic;">The beautiful is always strange</span>. I do not mean that it is coldly, deliberately strange, for in that case it would be a monstrosity that had jumped the rails of life. I mean that it always contains a touch of strangeness, of simple, unpremeditated and unconscious strangeness, and that it is this touch of strangeness that gives it its particular quality as Beauty. It is its endorsement, so to speak—its mathematical characteristic. Reverse the proposition, and try to imagine a <span style="font-style:italic;">commonplace Beauty</span>!...”. (quoted after the English translation in <span style="font-style:italic;">Art in Paris 1945–1862: Salons and Other Exhibitions Reviewed by Charles Baudelaire</span>. Trans.,and ed. Jonathan Mayne [London: Phaidon, 1965], 124; original emphasis.)

	  The quote <span style="font-style:italic;">taš</span><span style="font-style:italic;">čit’ i ne puščat’</span> is used in a satirical short story by Gleb Uspensky (1843–1902) to summarize the duties of a policeman: to “drag” [<span style="font-style:italic;">taščit’</span>] people where they don’t want to go, and “not let them” [<span style="font-style:italic;">ne puščat’</span>] go where they want to. At the turn of the twentieth century, it had become a popular idiomatic phrase for arbitrary power.

Kul’bin’s article on Cubism in the anthology “The Archer,” where he attempts at exposing the <span style="font-style:italic;">credo</span>* of the Cubists without saying anything on his own and getting dry out of the water. I remember an incident. One of the “nailers” was explaining his work to the audience. “It is not important as a work of art but rather as an approach.”—“Thank you, thank you—that means <span style="font-style:italic;">not as a work of art!</span>,” rejoiced a certain clergyman. This is quite an example of the right approach and virility [<span style="font-style:italic;">mužestvennost’</span>] of the beholder.

	    Tugendkhol’d refers to Apollinaire’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetic Meditations: The Cubist Painters</span> of 1913, most probably according to the extensive quote given by Nikolai Kul’bin in his essay “Kubizm” [Cubism] in <span style="font-style:italic;">Strelec</span> (The Archer), <span style="font-style:italic;">op. cit.</span>, 214. Apollinaire’s statement appears in a chapter on Picasso and the importance of truth in art regardless of the materials used by the artist: “For myself, I need only to see the labour, one has to see the labour, it is only by the quantity of the labour supplied by the artist that one measures the true value of a work of art.” (quoted after the English translation in: Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, eds., <span style="font-style:italic;">A Cubism Reader. Documents and Criticism 1906–1914</span>. [Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2008]: 492.)

	    Tugendkhol’d uses the neologism <span style="font-style:italic;">oe.kranennost’</span> which is based on <span style="font-style:italic;">e.kran</span> (screen) and might hint to the beginning of the poem “The Epilogue of Ego-Futurism” [1912] by Igor Severianin: “I,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the genius Igor Severianin,/ am inebriated by my victory:/ I am screened all-cityingly/ I am asserted all-heartedly” (literal translation of « Ia, genii Igor’ Sever’ianin,/ Svoei pobedoi upoën:/ Ja povsegradno oe.kranen / Ja povseserdno utverždën ».
