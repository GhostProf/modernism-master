</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to critic David Sylvester in 1960, Willem de Kooning described his canvases of the late 1950s, what I will call his "highway paintings," in the following way:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Most of them are landscapes and highways and sensations of that, outside the city—with the feeling of going to the city or coming from it … But I love to go out in a car. I'm crazy about weekend drives, even if I drive in the middle of the week. I'm just crazy about going over the roads and highways.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Coupling the artist's words with the paintings' titles—such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>], <span style="font-style:italic;">Merritt Parkway</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Interchange</span>—it is hardly surprising that critics have mentioned these canvases of 1957–1960 alongside the rapidly expanding American highway system.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> De Kooning's phrase "going to the city or coming from it" has led some to posit a transit-based interpretation: the highway paintings represent a space between the urban and the suburban. According to this logic, de Kooning's shift from his claustrophobic, so-called "urban" abstractions of the mid-1950s to the airy style of the highway paintings a few years later mirrors the simultaneous middle-class abandonment of the inner city, a process certainly spurred on by new freeway construction.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> De Kooning himself participated in such urban shifts: he spent increasing amounts of time traveling by car between Manhattan and eastern Long Island during the late 1950s and early 1960s, before permanently settling in the Hamptons in 1963.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>De Kooning's remarks on the "sensations" associated with driving have encouraged a second, more representational, reading of these paintings in relation to highways: landscapes as viewed from a speeding car.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> This interpretation provides a ral frame through which to view these canvases; they are landscapes mediated by automotive movement. Viewers can apparently see blurred impressions of grass, water, and sky in the paintings' broad planes of color.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>With the art historical paydirt of de Kooning's comments and titles, critics have failed to probe deeper, neglecting the complex interrelation between highway driving, gestural abstraction, and individual subjectivity at the end of the 1950s. I believe that these paintings are not merely illustrative of an American culture in transition, but rather are deeply engaged with its anxieties, triumphs, and contradictions.</p>
<p>Through their address of the seemingly disparate spheres of "action painting" and driving, de Kooning's highway paintings engage both artistic modernism and social modernization, describing how ideologies of the former enabled an expansion of the latter. De Kooning connects these spheres—driving and painting, the spatial and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> pictorial—through a discourse that coalesces around the dual meanings of the word "sign." First, the paintings embody the logic of the new interstate culture: simplified, standardized <span style="font-style:italic;">road</span> signs of action painting. Second, the highway paintings are a culmination of de Kooning's involvement with <span style="font-style:italic;">semiotic</span> signs: they demonstrate the increasing impossibility of unmediated expression within culture, despite lingering mythologies of authenticity. Ultimately, the duality of these paintings—that they appear as both triumphant and tragic in relation to subjectivity—makes them crucial utterances of this conflicted moment of the late 1950s, a moment when America was on the verge of pop art and postmodernity.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Action Painting and Driving</h1>
<p>When Harold Rosenberg coined the term "action painting" in 1952, he had de Kooning's slashing, gestural style in mind.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> For the critic, painters should not approach a blank canvas with a preconceived notion of subject matter, but rather use the process of painting itself as a means of expressing the doubts and struggles of the postwar world. From the start, the existential angst of this style was loosely connected to car culture, as discourses of speed and risk rhetorically structured both.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> With his comments about highways, de Kooning's paintings from the late 1950s literally mark a convergence of driving and what Rosenberg called the "arena" of action painting. De Kooning, however, was not the only artist to register such a connection in the 1950s; in fact, it was his friend Robert Rauschenberg who first explored the relationship.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1953—just a few months after "The American Action Painters" appeared—Rauschenberg was busy erasing a heavily worked de Kooning drawing, given to him by the older artist for this intended purpose. According to the story, Rauschenberg labored for nearly a month with many erasers to remove the gestural traces of the artist. The result, a work called <span style="font-style:italic;">Erased de Kooning</span>, is an expression of negation as an artistic gesture in its own right. During the same period, Rauschenberg produced a second important work on this theme, <span style="font-style:italic;">Automobile Tire Print</span>, in collaboration with John Cage [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. While Cage slowly drove a Model A Ford over a 21-foot length of paper in downtown Manhattan, Rauschenberg continually applied ink to one of the car's rear tires—thus producing a long image of a tire print.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> This resulting mark is formally similar to the brushstrokes that were the hallmark of action painters—a point made clear by comparing Rauschenberg's print to the bold, grayish vertical brushstroke on the right side of de Kooning's famous <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>] from 1950–52. Both forms exhibit a marked linearity and parallel grooves within their borders. Despite the multivalent interpretations that Rauschenberg's tire print willfully engenders, its conflation of the automobile and action painting cannot be ignored.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>These two works by Rauschenberg are more than temporally related; both critique the idea of the unique painterly gesture fundamental to the mythology of action painting. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Erased de Kooning</span>, Rauschenberg negates the emotive overtones of the drawing. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Automobile Tire Print</span>, he reconres the mechanical tire print as a mock-expressive brushstroke, complete with the "accidental" drips and spatters accrued in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the process. In these two works, Rauschenberg murders and then mocks the heroic brushstroke of the action painters, but does so in the second instance with a clear allusion to car culture.</p>

<p>De Kooning eventually strikes back; his majestic 1958 painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> can be viewed as an artistic rejoinder to Rauschenberg, with its giant brushstroke that resembles a tire print in both size and appearance. After Rauschenberg's erasure and subsequent conflation of the brushstroke with car culture, de Kooning recodes the tire print back into a painterly gesture, producing a mark that appears, on the surface, heroic, masculine, and strong. With its title, "Montauk Highway," de Kooning makes the picture's relationship to Rauschenberg and driving explicit.</p>
<p>In his reclamation of the brushstroke, de Kooning reinvests the form with at least a façade of existential credibility. The artist's words from 1959 describing his painting process support this idea: "I'm not trying to be a virtuoso … but I have to do it fast. It's not like poker, where you can build a straight flush or something. It's like throwing dice. I can't save anything."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> This language of danger and speed, of course, recalls Rosenberg's notion of the risk involved in action painting. A look of velocity is certainly present in the lightning quick, rust-colored brushstroke in <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>. No curves or lateral wrist movement slow down the swash of the brush; de Kooning's performativity—how the brushstroke connotes its own making—allows for a visualization of painted speed, especially the mark's abrupt start or stop toward the bottom of the canvas. These bold, tire-like brushstrokes are a staple in other highway canvases like <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Lisbeth's Painting</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">Bolton Landing</span> , thus demonstrating de Kooning's engagement with an associative conflation of painterly and automotive speed, including the associated "risks" of both.</p>
<p>This dialogue between de Kooning and Rauschenberg had cultural implications beyond friendly artistic rivalry. For critic Leo Steinberg, works like <span style="font-style:italic;">Automobile Tire Print</span> represented a shift from nature to culture, manifested in a move from the vertical picture plane capturing emotional or natural sensations to a horizontal "flatbed": <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>… Rauschenberg's picture plane had to become a surface to which anything reachable-thinkable would adhere. It had to be whatever a billboard or dashboard is, and everything a projection screen is, with further affinities for anything that is flat and worked over … Any flat documentary surface that tabulates information is a relevant analogue of his picture plane—radically different from the transparent projection plane with its optical correspondence to man's visual field.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Rauschenberg's tire print—itself a flatbed surface, capturing information—retroactively situates de Kooning's brushstroke in the realm of culture, something already mediated by social forces. De Kooning's marks in <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> and other highway paintings, alternatively, maintain a complex ambivalence in relation to subjectivity: by reconring the tire print back into a bold, gestural brushstroke, it lingers between the horizontal flatbed and vertical window, between Steinberg's realms of nature and culture, between modernist alienation and postmodern mediation. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Furthermore, Steinberg's own terms are themselves dependent upon the highway, as he uses concepts like billboards, dashboards, and flatbeds (a type of cargo truck) in his written description. It is as if the fault line between the modern and postmodern is the open road itself, a point reiterated by Michael Fried's 1967 connection of minimal art's "incurable" theatricality to Tony Smith's drive on the New Jersey Turnpike.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> De Kooning's highway paintings confuse and conflate these realms; they are simultaneously the last gasp of modernist autonomy as well as an early breath of postmodern mediation.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Standardization and Franchises: Highway/Paintings</h1>
<p>In May 1959, a 55-year-old de Kooning had a one-person show at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York—his first since 1956—filled with a number of highway paintings. <span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> magazine recapped the opening day of the unusually popular exhibition:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>As early as 8:15 in the morning on opening day, collectors were queuing up outside 57<sup>th</sup> Street's Sidney Janis Gallery, jostling for first peeks and early buys. By noon, 19 of the shows 22 oils were sold … At week's end a new De [sic] Kooning was not to be had for love or money. Shyly backed against a wall as the crowd milled through the gallery, De [sic] Kooning was startled and pleased: 'There's no way of astonishing anyone any more. I'm selling my own image now. It's being understood. That's the way it's supposed to be.'<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Lines outside a gallery and collectors jockeying for position hardly sound like the trappings associated with the avant-garde. As the artist himself noted, any pretension of radicalism in these canvases—and the related ideas of shocking the middle class—was missing by 1959. De Kooning's paintings sold like hotcakes; even the semblance of alienation had disappeared.</p>
<p>Not only were these paintings apparently "being understood" by his public, scores of artists were also imitating de Kooning's distinctive style and brushwork. In 1959, Thomas Hess addressed the emulation which began after the artist's 1956 exhibition: "the process of dilution has continued, reaching a high-comic point as young artists make whole one-man shows out of a studio idea swallowed whole from still unfinished de Kooning paintings."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The artist's brushwork, once considered emblematic of direct, unmediated subjective experience, was quickly coming to signify an empty, endlessly copied gesture. Clement Greenberg also noticed de Kooning's influence on a group of abstract artists, who all worked and gathered around 10<sup>th</sup> Street in downtown Manhattan. In 1964 the critic labeled such gestural mannerism the "Tenth Street touch."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Greenberg explained that what turned this emulation into "something bad as art was its standardization, … as a dozen, and then a thousand, artists proceeded to maul the same viscosities of paint … into the same kind of picture."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Put simply, the effects of action painting had begun to be mass-produced; it became a system to adopt, a posture to assume, and a brand to buy. Artists like Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns had been implying the banality of abstract expressionist heroism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and brushwork for a number of years (like in <span style="font-style:italic;">Automobile Tire Print</span>), but commercial success and artistic imitation began to render such contradictions explicit by 1959.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> T. J. Clark has suggested that the self-conscious, overblown "vulgarity" of canvases like de Kooning's highway paintings register the socioeconomic conditions of this historic moment, thematizing their own emptiness for aspirational patrons who did not know any better.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> For Clark, the mannered, vulgar existentialism of these paintings was an ideal commodity at the end of the 1950s. De Kooning's words, "I'm selling my own image now," certainly express this condition.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>In a sense, de Kooning's mass production, the standardization of his art, paralleled the growing discourse of the highway. As Thomas Hess and others lamented the homogeneity of action painting, the construction for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways was well underway. In 1956, President Eisenhower signed into law the Federal Aid Highway Act, which allowed for this construction—a proposed network of 41,000 miles of roads linking most American cities with a population of 50,000 or more. This expensive legislation (the federal government was to foot 90% of the bill) was pushed through Congress largely by appealing to the project's connection to economic growth and national defense needs—military mobility and speedy urban evacuations in case of nuclear attack.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> A drive on the interstate, then, could not only be viewed as a rebellious escape from the post-war world (as articulated in Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Road</span>) but also as something simultaneously attached to official narratives of prosperity and survival in the atomic age.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> By provocatively combining the realms of action painting and the highway at this exact moment, de Kooning intuited a way to address the crisis of subjectivity inherent to both artistic modernism and larger questions of modernization.</p>
<p>The new interstate system fundamentally restructured society; for one, it reproduced its own bureaucratic structures in the areas surrounding interchanges, according to Keller Easterling.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Such logic helped to create one of the most influential business practices of the last 50 years: franchising. In a study of this economic and cultural phenomenon, Thomas Dicke has posited that by the late 1950s, the number of franchisers had reached a "critical mass," as investors realized that more money was to be made in selling a business system (like a whole restaurant) instead of just an individual product (like a hamburger).<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Entrepreneurs established gas and fast food franchises in the 1930s, but the business model exploded with interstate construction, as the mobile landscape provided an ideal setting for these new ventures.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> In the world of national roadways, a recognizable sign and familiar food would be comforting—endowing an undifferentiated landscape with a uniform sense of place.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>De Kooning's highway paintings respond to this franchised culture of the interstate in two ways. First, the canvases are streamlined to the point where they become clear road-signs of action painting. Second, they demonstrate the commodity-like serialization of ostensibly subjective gestures.</p>
<p>De Kooning's refined style is the first key to <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>'s structural engagement with highway culture. The grime and detail that de Kooning noticed when walking Manhattan streets in the mid-1950s and captured in a dense, cluttered painting like  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span> [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>] was lost on the interstate and in the highway paintings. Furthermore, these canvases not only appear to connote speed with their quick strokes, but their basic pictorial forms can also be apprehended in a flash, or, to use de Kooning's words, with a mere "glimpse."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>, for instance, the subject is direct; an exaggerated, reddish brushstroke is clearly visible in a largely uniform yellow field.</p>
<p>In some ways, then, de Kooning's highway paintings replicate the visual realities of the interstate. Franchises located at interchanges required direct and efficient signage that might be understood with only a passing glance. Since motorists would usually be speeding though these highway corridors, traditional small signs announcing an upcoming restaurant or gas station would no longer suffice.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> As Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour later noted in their seminal <span style="font-style:italic;">Learning from Las Vegas</span> , the "graphic sign in space has become the architecture of this [suburban] landscape."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Even whole buildings began to function as signs and advertisements, designed to capture passing, mobile attention. It was these highways, suburbs, and franchises in the 1950s, then, that begot the 1970s landscape based largely on standardized commerce—a bureaucratic space designed to create and reflect consumer desire.</p>
<p>Considering the appearance of these highway paintings, it is no surprise that de Kooning was a successful commercial painter and store window designer in New York during the 1930s, as they have the immediacy of an effective commercial sign. The scale of the paintings only heightens such effects, as some of them tower over six-feet; perhaps a billboard aesthetic was on de Kooning's mind.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> In 1960, the artist revealed his affection for such roadside signs: "Some people want to take the signs [on the highway] away, but it would break my heart. All those different big billboards."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1968, in the same essay in which he tackles Rauschenberg's "flatbed picture plane," Leo Steinberg uses these notions of efficient, quick communication to discuss Kenneth Noland's long, horizontal striped canvases from the late 1960s. To the critic, these pictures represented the "idealization of efficient speed," as they eliminate any element hindering direct expression.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> And while Steinberg does not mention de Kooning's highway paintings specifically, they also, some ten year earlier, clearly participated in such a discourse of effective communication.</p>
<p>That is not to say, however, that a painting like <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> smoothes over all surface nuances; it is the painting's hand-made quality that allows both the mythologizing of heroic subjectivity and the postmodern condition of its mediation. These highway paintings are not the most efficient signs in the commercial sense—leave that to Noland in the late 1960s or certain earlier examples of pop art—but they maintain just enough friction to make them akin to road signs of action painting.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>The surface of <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span> furthers this reading of action painting as an effective commercial road sign. The bright, almost reflective quality of the crusty yellow paint belongs to the highway, recalling both the hue of warning signs and road paint.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> By leaving subtle pentimenti in the canvas—the gestural traces of blue and red just visible beneath the yellow coating on the right side—de Kooning makes the very act of refinement an explicit subject of this painting. Clearly done with the undercoat dry, de Kooning's act of yellow over-painting renders a more direct canvas, taming  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the nuances and surface incident found in earlier canvases like <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span>. However, de Kooning leaves a patch of bare canvas at the bottom right corner of <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>, and this is where the sign-quality of the painting falters. It can remind viewers that covering is an active gesture—that "refinement" and its associated destruction is a choice.</p>

<p>This interpretation of abstract expressionism based on speed of viewing goes beyond de Kooning's highway paintings; modalities of speed can be used as an organizing principle for mid-century American painting in general. If Pollock's lines enact a logic of barely controllable speed on the part of the artist, the simplicity of other artists' works from later in the 1950s embodies a shift to faster perception on the part of the spectator.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In his 1955 essay "American Type Painting," Greenberg elevated the more refined, geometric abstractions of Barnett Newman (monochrome fields with vertical lines called "zips") and Mark Rothko (floating squares that echo the frame) above the work of other American painters, including the more gestural painting of de Kooning and Pollock.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> And a decade later, Michael Fried, who largely followed in Greenberg's footsteps, described a successful painting as one in which "a single brief instant would be long enough to see everything."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> One can thus interpret the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Greenbergian mandate for the continuing refinement of pictorial means as producing paintings more like efficient commercial signs, clear forms with less visible evidence of the human hand. Simplified expression, therefore, is one place where the wires of modernist refinement and postmodernist mediation first cross.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> De Kooning's highway paintings stage this contradiction explicitly; they are, to repeat, something akin to road signs of gestural abstraction.</p>
<p>De Kooning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>], also from 1958, similarly features <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>'s yellow pigment, but demonstrates another prominent mandate of franchising: seriality, the same consistent product over and over.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> The row of arching yellow shapes visible just below the horizon-like line, for example, is almost industrial in its hand-drawn repetition; one can imagine the machine-like motion of de Kooning's hand, painting one arch after another. The two red brushstrokes brashly converging right above the artist's signature also appear analogous, only executed in different directions. <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> is a hand-painted, faux-expressive version of pop art's later repetition strategies, visible in something like Andy Warhol's serialized images of Marilyn Monroe begun in 1962. This effect is found throughout other highway paintings; in the brighter palate of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruth's Zowie</span> , six bluish-black brushstrokes of comparable length and width appear on the right half of the picture, their direction varying slightly with each slash. And in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tree in Naples</span> , two very similar zigzag patterns appear in different colors, with different spatial orientations, in the bottom third of the canvas. Such repetition strategies not only help to create more standardized canvases, but are also an acknowledgement of the mass production of a canned subjectivity in painting. The slight alterations in direction or orientation, however, allow these paintings to read more as signs of action painting than as pop. This reversibility and ambivalence is their power.</p>
<p>Road signs and seriality come together in a remarkable passage in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Suburb in Havana</span>, namely where the two converging reddish brushstrokes form a "V" and support two of the serialized golden marks. The "V" looks a bit like scaffolding holding aloft an italicized "M"; it can be read as a flat representation of a sign in a landscape. Not unrelated to the painting at hand, the fast food chain McDonald's began its franchising operations in 1952 and opened its first Long Island branch in the suburban community of Islip in 1958, the same year <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> was painted.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> Islip is located on the south shore of Long Island, roughly between Manhattan and the Hamptons. The "golden arches"—which de Kooning's "M" resembles—were immediately part of McDonald's architectural signage, as seen in its standard building from the mid-1950s [<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>]. De Kooning was likely aware of this new restaurant phenomenon, as the Islip franchise was located right on the Montauk Highway—a popular route to the Hamptons in the 1950s and the title of one of the highway paintings already discussed.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> This iconographic whiff of vulgar, franchised culture in the rarefied art world—like the line outside of his Sidney Janis exhibition in 1959—revealed de Kooning's engagement with franchising, to those who cared to notice.</p>
<p>Such an inclusion, it is important to note, is consistent with de Kooning's broader artistic practice. With a background in commercial art like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and James Rosenquist, de Kooning would not have ignored such apparently  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "low" sources as a McDonald's logo. In fact, de Kooning's proto-pop collage practice (gluing mouths cut from magazines into drawings of women from the early 1950s, for instance), demonstrate a long-standing interest in mass cultural sources.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Such recognizable images, however, do not reduce <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> to being simply about "McDonalds" or "automotive culture." Instead, such gestures situate this and other paintings securely within a dialogue connecting abstraction to ration, as well as connecting artistic modernity to larger issues of social modernization.</p>

<p>With their sign-like nature and seriality, the highway paintings are as close to pop as de Kooning would get. They are not far from Lichtenstein's <span style="font-style:italic;">Brushstroke</span> series of the mid-1960s, where the pop artist showed only the emptiness and Benday-dot reproducibility of the gesture, without its reversibility and ability to actually read as serious [<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>]. The highway paintings are both among the last action paintings and the first pop paintings, and de Kooning knew it: "I'm selling my own image now" sounds almost Warholian. De Kooning, however, could never cross into pure pop art, as to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">him it lacked innocence; it traded Steinberg's idea of nature for culture.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> The artist's work needed the tension between the two realms. And it is de Kooning's mannered naiveté and expressive fatalism—a type of starry-eyed world-weariness—that makes these highway paintings an endgame for him.</p>
<p>As such, a number of contemporary reviewers sensed something final about these canvases in 1959; the pictures, for instance, were a "passionately desired terminus," according to Dore Ashton.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> His radical shift to a baroque ration in 1963 suggests that there was some truth in this. And while one can say that the highway paintings occupy a position between the traditional picture plane and the flatbed, between the modern and postmodern, a larger story needs to be told: mainly, how did de Kooning arrive at this point where he wanted to flaunt subjective expression, as well as show its futility and commodification?</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Semiotic Signs to Nowhere</h1>
<p>De Kooning's 1958 canvas <span style="font-style:italic;">Detour</span> [<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>] will close one aspect of my discussion of these highway paintings as signs, while opening another. In this picture, the artist brushes on a large pinkish-white triangle through an economy of slashing strokes. By allowing a singular form to overwhelm the picture—like <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>—and naming the canvas after a road sign, de Kooning again employs the highway and its logic as a way to address the sign and commodity status of his own painting. But "detour" is also a very particular kind of road sign—indicating an alternative, less-direct way to arrive at one's desired destination. As highway signs go, this one is arguably the most important, as it can be the driver's only beacon through a maze of unfamiliar roads—producing an experience completely mediated by signs.</p>
<p>Considering this, de Kooning not only enlisted the highway to address the domestication of subjectivity in painterly and spatial terms, but also to address the semiotic implications of the franchised landscape. The highway paintings, therefore, are about signs in two ways: those on the roadside <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> those constituting the very nature of expression. For someone so attuned to the nuances and puns of language, de Kooning was likely aware of both the high and low variances of the word "sign" when painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Detour</span>.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> His interest in slippery language carries over, of course, into his painting. He repeatedly depicts certain images that can be read in two ways simultaneously: tire print and brushstroke, serialized gestures and McDonald's logo.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>As a commercial artist in the 1920s and 1930s, de Kooning produced signs for New York businesses and illustrations for magazine advertisements.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Scholars have repeatedly noted that some of the methods and materials from his commercial work filtered into de Kooning's "fine art" painting.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> For instance, he often used a delicate sign-painters brush and commercial sign paints when creating his black-and-white abstractions from the late 1940s that gave him his first critical success. In a number of these canvases, de Kooning even employed legible commercial lettering as the basis for otherwise abstract compositions. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Zurich</span> [<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>] from 1947, one sees how de Kooning used the letters "Z," "O," and "T," in addition to other more painterly marks, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">to create a charged field of forms in tension. Critics, including Greenberg, argued that the shallow space and reduced palette in these black-and-white paintings are indebted to the analytic cubism of Pablo Picasso.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> More than this, both artists are engaged with questions of semiotics, but in different ways.</p>
<p>For instance, Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ma Jolie</span> from 1911–12 posits a radical reconsideration concerning the very nature of representation. He cleaves the techniques for painterly depth (like shading and shadow) away from traditional representational practices, revealing their arbitrary and linguistic nature in the process.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Picasso, like de Kooning, also uses letters, stenciling "Ma Jolie" at the picture's bottom center. Read in conjunction with Picasso's other marks and considering its linguistic uncertainty (does it reference his current lover, a refrain from a popular song in 1911, or both?), these letters suggest an ambiguity at the heart of communication, whether linguistic or pictorial.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup></p>
<p>De Kooning's cubism builds upon Picasso's. The younger artist's letters are arbitrary, yet they begin to exert a carnal presence, like they are ting to signify flesh through their rigid forms.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> The curved shape on the right side of <span style="font-style:italic;">Zurich</span>, for instance, looks to be a remnant of a vestigial "P" or "R"—as well as an organic bodily contour. By the time of <span style="font-style:italic;">Painting</span> in 1948 and <span style="font-style:italic;">Attic</span> of 1949, his "letters" are largely unrecognizable as linguistic signifiers; they had fully mutated into ambiguous breasts, buttocks, or other body parts twisting around in an arena of the erotic.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> And through de Kooning's style of painting—with sharp demarcations of certain planes, sometimes achieved through masking Picasso's edges—the morphed "letters" take on attributes of fragments collaged from signs or bodies. Rendered arbitrarily equivalent and meaningless, these bits add up to an erotically charged emptiness: all surface, no real depth. This visual uncertainty, in some ways, is a source of the existentialism associated with the late 1940s paintings. Through investigating signs and not simply following them, one could think about the arbitrariness of communication as a surrogate for an unanchored human life.</p>
<p>To reiterate, de Kooning's background in advertising is important, especially for his mass cultural understanding of semiotics. These black and white pictures demonstrate how commercial art is not about the surface or textual meaning, but instead about the <span style="font-style:italic;">intertext</span>—the bodily desire lurking behind commercial letters. As semioticians have argued, most advertisements carry both an overt and a latent meaning. The first is a literal reading of the text, the second is created when a viewer mentally synthesizes all of an ad's elements—joining text and image, for instance. This latent meaning creates consumer desire, but the overt aspects serve to naturalize this desire through its apparent transparency and stability.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>These ideas emerge in de Kooning's commercial work. The artist's illustrations of men smoking pipes, for instance, appeared in a 1943 <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span> magazine advertisement for Model tobacco [<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>].<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> An image of a packet of the advertised product appears along the bottom, but in the middle of the page is <span style="font-style:italic;">another</span> kind of model, a color photograph of a posing woman. On the surface, the text "Home is where your Model is" is clear and to the point: this is a tobacco that is attached to ideas of domesticity. But the latent meanings—driven home by the text "Make a Date with Model," de Kooning's men hovering above the woman, and the mail-in offer for a full-color pin-up of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the female—sexualize the connection between the tobacco and the woman. With their commercial approach to cubism—showing how language commercially res flesh—de Kooning's black-and-white paintings not only express the linguistic uncertainty of language, but also how this very instability is the engine behind consumer desire that ultimately helped fuel the postwar economic boom.</p>

</div>
<p>In discussing his series of <span style="font-style:italic;">Women</span> paintings from the early 1950s de Kooning explained to Thomas Hess his concept of "no-environment" that informs his pictures and clearly demonstrates an interest in semiotics:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>De Kooning claims that the modern scene is 'no-environment' and presents it as such. To make his point, he opened a tabloid newspaper and leafed through its illustrations. There was a politician standing next to an arched doorway and rusticated wall, but remove the return of the arch—the wall might be a pile of shoe boxes in a department store, or 'nothing.' … The modern image is without distinct character, probably because of the tremendous proliferation of visual sensations which causes duplicates to appear among unlikes.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Although explained in rather humble language, de Kooning's "no-environment"—the 77 undecidability of space in contemporary photographic images—is the space of visual and semiotic ambiguity. Not only is language a dangerously arbitrary sign system—as viewed in the black and white paintings—but so are the photographic images used in the service of news and advertising, according to the "no-environment." Photos deploy an illusory stability.</p>
<p>By fully integrating his images of women into nowhere settings, de Kooning addresses the very fluidity of the postwar image. The surface of <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>], for instance, shows its age: it had been worked, scraped, and repainted off and on for two years. In an early state of the composition, a window clearly appeared over the woman's left shoulder.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> This form later disappeared—and then briefly reappeared—as de Kooning continued to evolve new environments for his subject. In the final version, a cross-like passage resembling a windowpane is visible in the location of the old window, maybe loosely alluding to one of the painting's past incarnations. Each trace of a past setting, or each changed context for his woman, thus affected the overall appearance of the painting. Seeing the same photographic image in different contexts—the same photo in a number of magazines, the same billboard in different sites, or the same pin-up hanging in different locations—engenders a comparable sense of its anchorless instability. The ways in which each encounter with a specific image changes subsequent viewings is part of <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span>'s struggle for life.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>It is fitting that Greenberg's concept of "homeless representation"—coined in 1962 and used to condemn de Kooning's work from the mid-1950s (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span>)—is virtually a synonym for "no-environment." Greenberg describes his conceit as "a plastic and descriptive painterliness that is applied to abstract ends but which continues to suggest representational ones."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> Both "no-environment" and "homeless representation," then, imply an image without a fixed home. It is as if Greenberg understands the semiotic importance of de Kooning's project, but he cannot stomach its connections to the kitsch of mass culture.</p>
<p>De Kooning's studio practice of excising "a lot of mouths" from magazines and placing them into different painted and drawn images, confirms this interest in the fluidity of images.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> In fact, his technique as described by Hess in a 1953 <span style="font-style:italic;">Art News</span> essay "De Kooning Paints a Picture," internalizes this logic of the unstable signifier into his own studio practice: "Before making changes [on the canvas], De [sic] Kooning frequently interrupted the process of painting to trace with charcoal on transparent paper large sections of, or the whole composition. These would be cut apart and taped on the canvas in varying positions."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> By turning his own practice into one of painterly collaging, a way of expressing the fluidity of the fragments within his own image archive, de Kooning can express the macro-logic of image fluidity operating within consumer capitalism at the micro, sublimated level of his own paintings. If Picasso's cubist portraits treated the female body as a conjunction of unstable pictorial signifiers—flesh turned into sign—de Kooning's women reclaim their flesh, while signifying how this apparent wholeness still fails to connote experience.</p>
<p>Collage is often cited as the key moment for Picasso's cubist revolution of the sign: pasting newspaper onto blank paper res the very absence present at the heart of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> signifying. Depth, therefore, becomes something written on the field, but not represented.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> Cubist collage is also of vital importance to Greenberg: it is the first realization of a completely non-illusionistic, flat pictorial surface.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> While de Kooning had always been interested in aping the effects of collage in paint, his process of newspaper transfer in the mid-1950s more directly references this technique than previous works. The process is simple: de Kooning would press a sheet of newspaper flush against the canvas's wet surface and then remove it. The effect is two-fold. First, the pressing of newspaper onto a nuanced surface flattens out the outward signs of subjectivity, thus repressing the traces of the hand in that passage. More importantly, the action leaves a ghostly reverse-image of newsprint in the paint. The transfer, then, allows de Kooning to signify the no-environment of these abstractions (like Picasso signifying depth with only newsprint in his collages) without the continuous reworking associated with <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman I</span>. For de Kooning, the press image was a source of literal instability (its blurriness and reproducibility); by fusing it with paint—a medium tied to personal expression—he found a way to express the instability of the printed image while still painting, a theme that would find its full expression in the highway paintings.</p>
<p>The transfers in <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span> are clearly visible on the left side and top edge of the painting [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>]. When coupled with its title and urban clutter, this canvas can represent the jumble of signification in the city, not only though its frenetic charcoal grime and twisting forms, but also at the very level of the sign and "no-environment." In the majestic <span style="font-style:italic;">Easter Monday</span> from 1955–56, the newspaper transfers threaten to overtake the entire painting; they are especially clear along the bottom and in the top right corner of the picture. This is, however, also the first painting where de Kooning's brushstrokes become broad and confident, and the clarity of the highway paintings is first glimpsed. It is at this point that de Kooning makes another radical pictorial discovery: he no longer needs newsprint or the evidence of a highly worked surface to express the instability of pictorial and linguistic signs. The painting's white brushstroke darting diagonally from the top edge (or, for that matter, the vertical yellow stroke just right of center), can signify nothingness just as well as the newsprint.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Gotham News</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Easter Monday</span> de Kooning fused paint and newsprint to signify the shifting "no-environment" while still using paint. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>, he takes the next logical step. In the specific moment of the late 1950s, de Kooning realized that he need no longer signify absence through recourse to explicitly cubist strategies but could do it merely through the abstract expressionist gesture writ large.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> Because the conspicuous brushstroke had become empty with its reproducibility and class associations, it could signify its apparent opposite—thus making a death of painting look heroic.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Like his other "no-environment" of an ambiguous press photo, de Kooning's brushstroke seemed to have a physical, indexical anchor in his own experience and action. At this time, however, the mark was as mediated as an image in a popular advertisement—say, the woman in de Kooning's tobacco advertisement. In form and content, therefore, the highway paintings are about signs, both high and low, roadside and semiotic. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Interchange: Doom and Progress</h1>
<p>In his important essay "Myth Today," Roland Barthes, like de Kooning and Steinberg, uses driving to address the contemporary world in the late 1950s, making the relation between highway culture and semiotics explicit at that moment:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>If I am in a car and look at the scenery though the window, I can at will focus on the scenery or on the window-pane. At one moment I grasp the presence of the glass and the distance of the landscape; at another, on the contrary, the transparence of the glass and the depth of the landscape; but the result of this alternation is constant: the glass is at once present and empty to me, and the landscape unreal and full. The same thing occurs in the mythical signifier.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Drivers can view the passing landscape as both shallow—mediated by the window—and in a natural, unmediated depth dependant upon the glass's invisibility. The windshield reveals the cultural structuring of the landscape (as flat information, like Rauschenberg's surfaces) as well as its apparent naturalness (seen in depth, like a traditional view). This is semiotic uncertainty: things appear as both "nature" and "culture" when riding in a car.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> De Kooning would have had time to ponder such things: as someone who never learned to drive, he could focus solely on this visual uncertainty during his frequent front seat rides between Manhattan and the Hamptons during the 1950s.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>Driving plays more than a subsidiary role in a shift to a world of shallow images, a condition often related to postmodernity. Cultural theorist Margaret Morse has recognized that a car in motion on the freeway is an "intensely private space lifted out of the social world."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> In her terms, it is a nonspace, "an elsewhere which inhabits the everyday."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Drawing on Barthes, she concludes that drivers and passengers float between "a real outside and an idealized representation," and such a duality fosters a new "fiction effect."<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Motorists can view their life as a myth of control, the glass fetishizing their surroundings,<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> while the shift to a view in depth makes the experience appear as a given. Comparable to nineteenth-century colonial representations of foreign landscapes, the view through the car windshield can naturalize an ideology of modernization and spatial domination.<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> As such, scholars have noted how traveling fast on the interstate fosters a "mastery of space"—making large things seem manageable, thus erasing feelings of personal inadequacy.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> The pattern is clear: whether pictorially (road sign) or spatially (semiotic sign), de Kooning's highway paintings occupy a position perennially in-between nature and culture, modernity and postmodernity.</p>
<p>In his powerful description of postmodernity, Jean Baudrillard relates an overriding cultural logic of "driving" with the novelty of televisual flatness in the world.<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> Subjects no longer experience the wholeness of an object, but only its flat, easily transmissible image. In his view, "the drama of alienation" had transformed into "the ecstasy of communication."<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> And while de Kooning's paintings do not express a full realization of such "ecstasy" (this would be the realm of certain pop art or Noland's late-1960s canvases of "idealized speed," discussed by Steinberg), they do embody a flatness that makes them comparable to a Baudrillardian sign. Importantly, however, a sense of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the "drama of alienation" is also present in the friction and physicality of de Kooning's brushstrokes.</p>
<p>As I have suggested, the flat nature of the highway paintings was among the qualities most noticed by the critics of de Kooning's 1959 exhibition.<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> This flatness is certainly evident in <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway</span>, as the primary brushstroke sits on the surface of the picture plane, asserting its presence as a physical entity, not as a mark defining volume. Such flatness then can situate these paintings into a discourse now associated with Baudrillard's version of postmodernism. But after reading Barthes, one can also interpret these serialized arches in <span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> as a series of diagonal lines receding back into the picture plane—a cursory, lazy way to depict painterly depth. Greenberg also saw depth in the artist's paintings from the period: "deep space is … increasingly suggested in almost everything de Kooning has done lately."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> So again, there is a sense of depth <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> flatness in the highway paintings—the same alternation of which Barthes speaks.</p>
<p>Steinberg argued in 1968 that many kinds of pictorial flatness exist. For him, Greenberg's influential definition was only one among many, and furthermore, it was largely arbitrary and ahistorical.<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> De Kooning's fickle flatness, then, must be read in its own terms. It is not only a product of the cubist evolution that I have traced, but a way to use the experience of riding in a car to explore the individual's place in the late 1950s. In his highway paintings, de Kooning rethinks the "no-environment"; it becomes less about the false anchors of words or fluidity of images, but instead about the very instability of human subjectivity in such an image-based society of franchises and serialized gestures, despite the body's apparent anchors in the world. The paintings look expressive, but they are only superficially that, a consequence of the new flatness that Baudrillard describes.</p>
<p>Writing in 1958, the year of <span style="font-style:italic;">Montauk Highway,</span> architectural critic Lewis Mumford understood exactly how driving itself could naturalize destruction: "Perhaps the only thing that could bring Americans to their senses would be a clear demonstration of the fact that their highway program will, eventually, wipe out the very area of freedom that the private motorcar promised to retain for them."<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup> Barthes also writes cogently about the process: "[myth] transforms history into nature"—or, to translate this into Steinberg's terms, culture into nature.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup> It is this duality that enables destruction in the name of progress; it allows a drive on a raised inner-city portion of an interstate without thinking about the historical progress of traumas and dislocation its construction caused below.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Whether related to Jack Kerouac or the action painters, Mumford's ideas resonate with the stakes of this period: an empty gesture of subjectivity could naturalize and franchise subjectivity, reduce its sphere, and increase its colonization. As Morse states, echoing Foucault, the interstates are systems of control without the need for panoptical positions; they are "fully congruent with the values of individualism and hedonistic pleasure."<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup></p>
<p>De Kooning's paintings, however, move beyond the functioning of myth to reveal its very power structure. Since they address such serious issues as the franchising of gesture and landscape, one would expect these paintings to look melancholic or  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> foreboding—to register consciously some of the period anxieties on the surface. These 81 paintings on the whole, however, are attractive canvases that would look great in a modern living room. Why else would 19 out of 22 of the highway paintings sell before noon at the exhibition's opening day in 1959? By making an image of the homogenization of self and place so desirable and attractive, these works not only demonstrate the upward aspirations of the middle classes, but also at the same time the way in which these groups willingly participated in and brought upon their own destruction and serialization. Through the mutual heroism and emptiness of his highway paintings, de Kooning marks these contradictory times: how, to quote Marshall Berman, various forces were destroying the world, while seeming "to be working in the name of values that we ourselves embraced."<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup> The sunny disposition of these canvases is the source of their tragedy: postmodern doom pictured as modernist progress.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f10" href="#f10-text">10. </a>The connection between driving and action painting manifests itself in a number of other anecdotal ways—whether in Jackson Pollock or Franz's Kline's penchant for fast cars, de Kooning's friendship with Jack Kerouac, or Pollock's famous 1956 death in a high-speed car crash in East Hampton.</p></div>

Walter Hopps and Susan Davidson (New York: Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 1997), 553. A number of commentators speak of a connection and friendship between de Kooning and Rauschenberg. In an earlier work, for instance, Rauschenberg collaged a newspaper reference to "DeKoning" [sic] into a work (Prather, "Catalogue," 134–5). And the fact that de Kooning gave Rauschenberg a drawing for the express purpose of erasure indicates a certain level of trust and understanding (Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan, <span style="font-style:italic;">de Kooning: An American Master</span> [New York: Alfred A.

Clark, <span style="font-style:italic;">Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism</span> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), 401. Clark believes abstract expressionism is at its best when its over-expressive bravado is right on the surface, "because it is then that it grasps most fully the conditions of representation—the technical and social conditions—of its historical moment" . It is in this period (c. 1958–1962) that abstract expressionism became a form of visual currency to fuel the "petty bourgeoisie's aspirations to aristocracy" . In this essay, Clark reproduces two de Kooning highway paintings from the 1959 exhibition—<span style="font-style:italic;">Suburb in Havana</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Merritt Parkway</span>—as exemplary of this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> process. The brushstrokes in these canvases are so expressive and so painterly, they have to be read as at least partly meretricious, according to Clark .</p></div>

John O'Brian (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1986), 228. Also see David Sylvester, "Flesh Was the Reason," <span style="font-style:italic;">WDKP</span>, 20–21. De Kooning has spoken highly of cubism: "Of all movements, I like Cubism most. It had that wonderful unsure atmosphere of reflection." See Willem de Kooning, "What Abstract Art Means to Me" , reprinted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Willem de Kooning: Pittsburgh International Series</span>, 23.</p></div>

William Rubin (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1992), 262. Krauss links this practice to Picasso's recognition of the loss of the carnal body to vision; because depth is only realized through a mental reconstitution of lived spatial experience, it can only be signified, not actually represented .</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f53" href="#f53-text">53. </a>The text "Ma Jolie" has long fascinated Picasso scholars.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f54" href="#f54-text">54. </a>Marcel Duchamp's variations on cubism are a closer equivalent to de Kooning's work. David Joselit has convincingly demonstrated that Duchamp's style of cubism circa 1914 posits an "infinite regress" between language and the carnal body. Language and sign systems are arbitrary <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> carnal for Duchamp; his paintings endow rationality with a sense of flesh, and vice versa. De Kooning is also interested in these issues, but for different reasons. See David Joselit, <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Regress: Marcel Duchamp 1910–1941</span> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998), 24–27.</p></div>

These images of his work appearing in different public contexts transform the painting itself into a source of photographic instability, and might have spurred the subsequent evolution of his "no-environment."</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f66" href="#f66-text">66. </a>David Sylvester makes a visual link between Picasso's pastings and de Kooning's large brushstrokes. He said: "In these de Kooning landscapes large, loaded brush marks echo with massive resonance those beautifully flimsy pieces of paper cut out in triangles and quadrilaterals and polygons and stuck down on a sheet of paper in dynamic balance." See "Flesh was the Reason," 20.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f67" href="#f67-text">67. </a>T. J. Clark addresses this shift as de Kooning's attempt to express "a manner in search of an object," by using the "mere props" of a pseudo-landscape format as subject matter (<span style="font-style:italic;">Farewell to an Idea</span>, 394). The aggrandized aggression, then, becomes the subject. Yet Clark does not acknowledge the semiotic implications of the new style—how it addresses not only the emptiness of gesture, but also of the larger social environment.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f69" href="#f69-text">69. </a>Around 1940, Ford Motor Company asked various commercial illustrators to submit drawings of America as pictured through a car windshield for a series of advertisements. De Kooning submitted examples for this campaign, but did not receive this commission. Therefore, he had already visually considered the landscape mediated by automobiles in his commercial past.
