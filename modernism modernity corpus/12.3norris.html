The first article I ever read by Hugh Kenner on Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> was "Homer's Sticks and Stones," published in the <i>James Joyce Quarterly</i> . In this essay Kenner subjects what T. S. Eliot called Joyce's "mythical method" to a meditation that we might now consider a quasi-deconstructive maneuver. As we know, Joyce learned Latin but not Greek in his Jesuit university, and Hugh Kenner asks how Joyce would have acquired his Homer. The answer, of course, is through translation, and given that there were numerous translations available, and given the late nineteenth-century controversy about Homer's identity, Kenner suggests that Joyce's Homer would have been multiple Homers. In <i>Joyce's Voices</i> he names them, the "fairly business-like translations" of Cowper and Butler, Parry and Lord's "'oral-formulaic' improviser," and "the stained-glass Homer of Butcher and Lang" (<i>JV,</i> 65&#x02013;6). Kenner's 1969 essay was virtually contemporaneous with Roland Barthes's "The Death of the Author," and yet it illustrates one of Hugh Kenner's salient gifts&#x02014;to think theoretically without explicit resort to the discourse of theory. Kenner's principled rigor as a critic reflected a sensibility that allowed multiplicities and indeterminacies continually to complicate his respect for the empirical and his commitment to objectivity. In his early essay on Joyce's Homer, Kenner illustrates the constructed nature of the author, and in <i>The Pound Era,</i> he suggests that there is not one Joyce but several. Without benefit of narratological apparatus, Kenner also illustrates subtle concepts in theories of 

<b></b>

narrative. In his work on <i>Ulysses</i> especially, Kenner treats Joyce's novel as a writerly text by filling in its gaps and void spaces with such powerful, convincing supplements that many of our <i>Ulysses</i> (plural) are dialogical texts in which the voices of Joyce and Kenner converse and blend.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  These strategies of the early Kenner, produced in his Joyce criticism of the 1970s, have become for many of us a kind of critical unconscious.
</p>

<p>
The bridge between Kenner's commitment to objectivity and evidence, on the one hand, and his allowance of multiplicities, on the other, is his ability to hear literary language against the background of silence. For Kenner, as for Sherlock Holmes, the most significant sounds were sometimes the ones that were not audible, and the most interesting scenes in fiction, especially Joyce's, were lodged in a seeming void or gap. Kenner's empirical bent initially required him, however, to take issue with one of modernism's sacred texts. He wrote in <i>Joyce's Voices,</i> "The handy word 'myth,' as in Eliot's '<i>Ulysses,</i> Order and Myth,' is simply wrong, an uninspected legacy from the age of Matthew Arnold and Max M&#x000FC;ller" (<i>JV,</i> 64). For the Homer Kenner liked best as Joyce's inspiration was the one whose Troy had a historical existence, like Heinrich Schliemann's and Samuel Butler's. "[T]he Homer of Joyce's time was the archaeologist's," he wrote in "Homer's Stick's and Stones"&#x02014;that is, not a myth-making idealist or a romancer but an empirical observer.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Kenner also claimed that Joyce, like Butler, took "the archeologist's Homer seriously," by considering "what it might mean to believe that the <i>Odyssey</i> was composed by a real person in touch with the living details of real cities, real harbors, real bowls and cups and pins and spoons, real kings, real warriors, real houses" ("HSS," 293). Kenner here adumbrates a modernist methodological bent he elaborates more fully in <i>Joyce's Voices</i> where he calls it "Objectivity," the "attention to the evidential" (<i>JV,</i> xi). Kenner traces "Objectivity" to the early nineteenth century, when new disciplines dictated that "men should learn to merely look and listen, that attention to what was and was not evidence might deliver the methodiz'd mind from self-deception" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
Kenner adheres to this discipline almost literally&#x02014;particularly and (ironically, given his early hearing loss) to its caveat to <i>listen.</i> What he heard were multiplicities, the pluralized voices of Homer from all those different translations become audible in <i>Ulysses,</i> and the often pluralized voices in the Joycean text. Sometimes this multiplicity was audible to Kenner in a single line, and sometimes he heard it in a present or even an absent punctuation mark. Reading Joyce's story "Eveline," he heard something in two commas: "'He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres [comma] he said [comma] and had come over to the old country just for a holiday'".<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Kenner goes on: "Great issues may be said to hang on those commas, which stipulate not only that Eveline is quoting Frank, but that Frank has been quoting also: quoting from the kind of fiction Eveline will believe, the fiction in which ready lads 'fall on their feet'" (ibid). To a narratologist, the commas signify merely a tag clause or an inquit formula&#x02014;the "he said" of tagged indirect discourse as Seymour Chatman might call it.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  But when Kenner heard invisible quotation marks in Joyce, they signaled that multiple voices were speaking in a single line&#x02014;that fiction was speaking through fictional discourse. To Kenner great issues attached to the narratological quirks, because one of them, free indirect 

<b></b>

discourse, allowed him to rescue Joyce from the brutal disparagement of Wyndham Lewis. Lewis generally heard in Joyce's written diction the phony accents of the parvenu and the poseur. But he finds that Joyce slipped up in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</i> Citing the sentence, "Every morning, therefore, Uncle Charles <i>repaired</i> to his outhouse," Lewis sniffed that people only "<i>repair</i> to places in works of fiction of the humblest order".<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  But Kenner, listening to Lewis listening, heard something else, namely that "repaired" wore invisible quotation marks. "It would be Uncle Charles's own word should he chance to say what he was doing," Kenner writes, and he honors Uncle Charles's unspoken style of speaking by giving his name to Joyce's innovation, "the normally neutral narrative vocabulary pervaded by a little cloud of idioms which a character might use if he were managing the narrative" (<i>JV,</i> 17). We could argue over whether Joyce invented free indirect discourse, or whether Hugh Kenner merely discovered its use in Joyce's writing.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Kenner's Uncle Charles Principle made this unobtrusive narrative practice audible: "So let us designate the Uncle Charles Principle: <i>the narrative idiom need not be the narrator's"</i> (<i>JV,</i> 18).
</p>

<p>
Hearing poorly, Kenner heard acutely in a variety of registers simultaneously. He heard unspoken sounds that had no substance, that were there but not there, and he heard sounds as material and solid as a hard substance. To convey what he heard, Kenner composed his own poetic language, a singular style of critical writing that lodges with particular grace in our ears. He res the "little cloud of idioms" surrounding a narrator's words in free indirect discourse as specks of tiny insects&#x02014;seemingly insignificant and yet as insistent as gnats: "A word he need not even utter is there like a gnat in the air beside him, for us to perceive in the same field of attention in which we note how 'scrupulously' he brushes his hat" (<i>JV,</i> 17). At other times, the sounds have the solidity of metal, as in the opening of the story "Grace": "Joyce has a way of ringing an opening sentence like a coin on a counter; we respond to the ring; our senses lock in" (<i>JV,</i> 14). When the sound turns leaden, as it does for Kenner in the opening of "The Dead," his antennae quiver: "The first sentence of 'The Dead' has also a leaden ring, very perceptible to the translingual ear" (<i>JV,</i> 15). The sentence is "Lily, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet." The translingual ear is Joyce's, whose "household language," Kenner reminds us, "was Italian, his public language during the <i>Ulysses</i> period successively Triestino, Schweizerdeutsch and French. He was normally poised between some other language and English" (<i>JV,</i> 15). The translingual ear's advantage transmuted it into a transliterary ear attuned to the invisible idioms of novelistic writing that turn its language into "unobtrusive novelese" (<i>JV,</i> 68). Writers with a translingual ear could hear and thereby avoid or exploit the invisible idiom of "the rattling good stories" of Edwardian fiction. Kenner writes, "To the inhabitant of a period, the characterizing idiom of that period, whether in painting, in sculpture or in literature, is absolutely invisible. It took Conrad&#x02014;a Pole&#x02014;Joyce&#x02014;a Dubliner&#x02014;and Hueffer&#x02014;who would rather have been writing in French&#x02014;to detect Edwardian novelese accurately enough to avoid it, or (in Joyce's case) to use it deliberately before avoiding it deliberately" (ibid). This novelese has another sound that rings like a coin on a counter, and Kenner hears it in the diction of the stage-Irishman, the stage-Englishman,

<b></b>

and the stage-poet in the opening of <i>Ulysses</i>: "So the style of 'Telemachus,' called in the famous schema 'Narrative (young),' today gives off here and there an unmistakable ring of Edwardian novelese" (<i>JV,</i> 69).
</p>

<p>
Behind this acute ear trained on the sounds of literary history, the Objectivist was always active and ready to pounce. As a critic of Joyce, Kenner loved to sleuth for what was not there but there, untold and inaudible yet capable of being inferred, invisible yet visualizable. These were textual moments caught between presence and absence that he named "The Rhetoric of Silence," the title of his 1979 <i>James Joyce Quarterly</i> article. But unlike a true deconstructionist captivated by undecidability itself&#x02014;Kenner could not resist "Sherlockholmesing" the text, as the narrator of "Eumeaus" might call it, turning innocuous bits of matter into evidence, and training on them his formidable deductive powers.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  This was his procedure in "Molly's Masterstroke" , which many of us consider "Kenner's Masterstroke." The essay was triggered by a question: if Bloom banged his cranium on the door of his front room because the furniture has been moved, who moved it and why? In this gap in the narration Kenner inscribes the bedroom farce that he calls Molly's failed masterstroke: "We shall see Molly attempting a counterstroke of her own; or rather, we shan't see her attempt. We'll have to deduce it, though from ample evidence" ("MM," 22). Kenner then concludes that Blazes Boylan moved the furniture at Molly's request, presumably to mitigate his threatening sexual prowess. For Kenner, fictional women&#x02014;like Flaubert's fictional women&#x02014;are kinetic rather than static readers, as Stephen Dedalus might call them, and Molly Bloom here acts under the presumed influence of her favorite pornographer, Paul De Kock. But the power of Kenner's argument&#x02014;the marshalling of evidence, the logical reconstruction of events and their presumed motives&#x02014;is so powerful that we forget that he has performed a purely speculative exercise. He has hypothesized a scene missing from <i>Ulysses</i> yet made it so palpably vivid and convincing by his argument that we feel it is <i>there</i>&#x02014;that we have read it in Joyce's text. Hugh Kenner turned <i>Ulysses,</i> already a dialogical work in the Bakhtinian sense, into a text whose voids have been filled by Kenner's voice.
