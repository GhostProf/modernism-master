"There is nothing historical about this book except the state of mind,"
Stein tells us in the epilogue to her novel, <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>,
a book about life in wartime France, written during the years
1940-1943.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Stein's bellicose, quintessentially modernist
declaration is worth our attention, as is the curious allegorical fiction
to which it is appended, since her last novel and its epilogue place us
precisely at a tangled interchange where concerns about identity, history,
ethics, and politics converge in our century. Her assertion captures the
simultaneous contraction and expansion of the modern subject: so tiny
that its domain can be no bigger, of no more moment than a "state of
mind"; so gigantic that it can push a world's war into the shadows as it
commands an entire book about its "state." If we are conceiving the mind
in its condition of maximum extension, we do not interpret the pivotal,
ambiguous "except" as dismissive. Since nothing else is, who could imagine
a book more thoroughly or appropriately saturated by history, or history
more aptly situated in its properly subjective location? States on a map
matter less than a mind's moods, its modes of being. But if, in looking
from a different angle, we observe the mind in its contracted state,
all that remains on the pages of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> are faint echoes
of events occurring elsewhere--events that might matter but that cannot
be told--"aethereal rumours."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I aim in this essay to trace the outlines of this variable place Stein
names a "state of mind" and to ascertain whether we might measure its
position in time, in history. Stein and her texts present us with
peculiar and important difficulties when we attempt to make these
measurements, and the reasons for

<B></B>

those difficulties derive
from her understanding of the self's relation to time. Like any number
of modernists, she concerns herself centrally with the faculty of memory
and the discipline of reading the world historically. She is obsessed by
temporality. But today, when socio-historical contextualization of a work
of art has come to seem an essential component of any discussion of that
work, when "the time of and the time in the composition" is of enormous,
even unprecedented consequence, Stein proves doggedly resistant to our
customary gambits for such temporal framing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 She forces
us to scrutinize the assumptions underwriting our historiographic
practices. On the one hand, those practices are profoundly skeptical
ones, as evidenced by the proliferation of studies that treat memory
as the unavoidable, notoriously distorted and distorting lens through
which we recall the past. On the other hand, our unsettling attention
to memory is counterbalanced by a fascination with historical material,
with actual things retrieved, with photographs and documents bearing
witness to another time, with endless, telling details brought to
light, with archives that promise wholesale recovery of the past. The
general effect of this bifurcated historiographical practice often
seems to be a confidence that, by both acknowledging the role of the
recollecting subject in our accounts of the past and embracing the
voluminous inventories that we have recovered from prior eras, we are
closer than ever before to unprecedentedly accurate, psychologically
nuanced positioning of texts, authors, and events in time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein will not allow that confidence to persist unshaken, or the goal
of recovery to stand unquestioned. I focus this essay on two of her
texts--<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> and "Phenomena of Nature"--both of which
explore disjunctions among writing, interiority, events, and recalling and
recounting the passing of time. <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> poses questions about
how we account for character and how we live in time, how we construe
history. "Phenomena of Nature," together with the manuscript witnesses
associated with that essay, provides us with a venue for considering the
relations between time's passing and the act of writing itself. How are
we to remember Stein's work? How should we recall it for readers at this
century's end? How does she teach us to remember her? What obstacles
does she deliberately place in the paths of our remembrances, and why
does she desire that our attempts at recollection should prove difficult?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over the past two decades, Stein's work, has been, taken from an
earlier location in literary-historical narratives that sketched
quiet salons where she and her charmed circle of artist friends
experimented with form and style, and repositioned in new locations
that give her much more prominence and prestige in today's academy:
the consequential thoroughfares of modern politics, Western history,
social reform, and sexual liberation. We must now attend closely to
"the racial-ethnic-religious-national politics of both [Stein's] work
and her life," Marianne DeKoven exhorts us, celebrating current critical
practices that have enabled us "to see Stein's experimental writing as
at once located in time, life, history, materiality," and lauding recent
critics who have vastly expanded "the limits of the possibilities for
representing that locatedness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 And yet, though Stein's
former situation in the salon was cramped and

<B></B>

her work devalued,
she does not make her relocation entirely happily. Throughout her life
she fervently embraced the local, but she resisted with equal fervor
being "located" in most of the senses intended by DeKoven. While she
dismantles and reinvents much of her Western linguistic inheritance
and can therefore be construed, in aesthetic terms at least, as a
revolutionary, no modernist more uncompromisingly asserts independence
from and indifference to each of the politicized venues in which she
currently finds herself. Stein energetically and ingeniously displaces
both politics and history from a great deal of her work. As an ironic
consequence, she stands at odds with her current audience at precisely the
time when that audience is larger and more enthusiastic than it has been
at any time since the mid-1930s. Perhaps we need to attend more fully
to Stein's resistance to the kind of sociohistorical positioning that
has become almost automatic in today's academy, and to consider how it
might teach us to perform the task of assigning her a position in "place,
time, life, history, materiality." I do so not by way of objecting to the
intent that motivates the historical-materialist turn in English studies,
but to argue that if we are to make this turn responsibly, honoring the
shapes of the texts we are framing, we must make every effort to assess
the meanings that our categories of understanding--"history," "politics,"
even "time" itself--might have held for the subjects of our scrutiny.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Wanda Van Dusen's "Portrait of a National Fetish: Gertrude Stein's
'Introduction to the Speeches of Mar&eacute;chal P&eacute;tain'
," provides an extended, recent instance of this impulse toward
materialist positioning. Immediately, in the parenthesis included in the
essay's title--""--Van Dusen promises to place us in a precise
historical location: the moment, 19 January 1942, when Stein sent to
Bennett Cerf, editor at Random House, her laudatory preface to the
translated speeches of Philippe Henri P&eacute;tain, leader of France's
pro-German Vichy government (1940-1944). Though students of Stein
have known about the existence of this preface since Richard Bridgman
provided a cogent description of it in <I>Gertrude Stein in Pieces</I>
, Van Dusen gives us, in addition to her own ambitious and extensive
analysis, the full text of Stein's preface itself, now published for the
first time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 For Van Dusen, Stein's preface "rekindles the
debate over the depth of conviction behind Stein's 'anti-patriarchal'
experimental writing between 1906 and 1932 in light of evidence of her
political conservatism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Van Dusen builds her appraisal of
Stein's politics around a number of simplistic assertions: between 1906
and 1932 Stein campaigned against "the patriarchy," but she stopped
campaigning as her work grew more accessible; aesthetic experiment
is "anti-patriarchal"; political beliefs and aesthetic practices
correspond. Van Dusen is dismayed by Stein's preface not simply because it
praises P&eacute;tain but because Stein fails to declare her own identity
with sufficient openness, nor does she discuss "the gender, class, sexual,
and racial composition of the 'new France,' and she thereby allows "the
invisible face of a diverse population [to be] obscured by the unifying
state mask of the Mar&eacute;chal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Stein is deceptive
in her deliberate "evacuating [of her] gender, her lesbianism, and
Jewishness--those cultural processes abjected by public discourse. Without
these markers, the unified self

<B></B>

presented by Stein can be safely
subsumed in the dominant category of 'we' in France."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 And
when Stein approaches political discussion from her hiding place behind
the dishonest pronoun "we," Van Dusen finds the shape of that discussion
deplorable and familiar: "Stein's text reinscribes the mythical thinking
of the Vichy political ideology, an archaism characteristic of fascism
and Nazism and symptomatic of culture's anxiety in the face of socially
disruptive modernization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But it is the very familiarity of Stein's failings to Van Dusen--and
the utter familiarity of the terms in which Van Dusen finds fault with
Stein--that betray Van Dusen's by no means uncommon abridgment of time's
passing. Inquiry into a different time and place and another's body of
writing must register that difference and that distance if it is to be
even remotely true to the nature of the faculty--memory--that allows
us to experience time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 That registering must occur not
only in historical research, but also in the details of diction, and
in the development and application of categories of understanding. The
political ruler Van Dusen applies to Stein is calibrated for 1996:
"politics" is a practice that begins and ends with a forthright
assertion of one's identity and involves a careful measuring of one's
socioeconomic, racial, and sexual positions vis-&agrave;-vis the
dominant sociopolitical order. The Stein Van Dusen dreams of finding
when she looks in the direction of 1942 is someone she knows too well
and too easily: an aesthetically radical Jewish lesbian who builds her
equally radical political practice upon open declarations of her various
identities--someone whose thinking about individuals and culture contains
at its center the categories by which we are accustomed to measuring
diversity: gender, class, race, sexual orientation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 When
Stein turns in her portrait of P&eacute;tain to myth and prophecy, she
falls by ready association into an archaism identical with the archaism
characteristic of fascist ideology. When she invokes the "old prediction
that when the enemy had gotten to Lyons the country that is France would
be saved by an old man on a white horse and P&eacute;tain had always
ridden a white horse," she mystifies political power in precisely the way
that Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin did.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Here is a Stein
whose identity should promise us a certain kind of laudable left-wing
politics and whose failures to achieve that position we are consequently
to recognize and lament. Van Dusen's tendency to assimilate prior time to
our own is reflected not only in the general categories of understanding
around which she builds her essay, but also in her prose, which is by no
means unusually filled with jargon, but which is nevertheless redolent
of the late 1990s--a rhetorical failure of memory that makes it difficult
to glimpse a subject located in another time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the most basic but nevertheless crucial level, Van Dusen, energetically
describing Stein's Introduction as "performing a redemptive fetishistic
ritual that denies the existence of racism in the so-called free zone
administered by P&eacute;tain," fails to pay sufficient attention to
what <I>can</I> be known of French history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 She is more
interested in the theoretical construct of "the fetish" than in what
it might have been like to live in occupied France in the first two
years of the war. Even before we turn to P&eacute;tain and Stein, we
should understand that being a Jew in occupied France,

<B></B>

rather
than encouraging a public declaration of solidarity with marginalized
populations or recriminations against France's puppet government, would
have been more likely to encourage Stein in her longstanding preference
for avoiding risky, public, political stands.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 And Philippe
Burrin's ambitious, extensive history of <I>France Under the Germans:
Collaboration and Compromise</I> (New York: New Press, 1993) makes it
clear that Stein's admiration for P&eacute;tain, even as late as the
winter of 1941, was more ordinary, more widespread, more emotionally
comprehensible than Van Dusen's piece would have us believe. In the
early 1940s, particularly after the British had preemptively shelled
the French fleet at Mers el Kebir in Algeria in the summer of 1940,
resistance, to the majority of the French, looked suicidal and promised
little but further destruction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

At this juncture , the French were grateful to [P&eacute;tain] for
having brought the ting to an end, for lending the defeated country
his prestige and for offering them words of compassion. P&eacute;tain
was the one fixed star on a collapsed horizon, the man who could restore
the four cardinal points for them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even after most of France had turned fully against the Vichy government,
in the autumn of 1942 (Stein mailed her preface to Cerf, we should
recall, in January of 1942), "P&eacute;tain's aura was . . . not totally
dissipated. As a public re, he continued to be respected to the
bitter end by part of the population, which felt compassion for him
and regarded him as a symbol of their suffering country."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

Stein concludes her introduction with applause for P&eacute;tain that
is culpably myopic but not anomalous, not simply a modernist invention
or part of a disingenuous posturing to save her from deportation:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And so we in France having seen France governed . . . having seen every
time that all being lost actually everything was being held together,
I must say little by little the most critical and the most violent of
us have come gradually to do what the Mar&eacute;chal asks all French
people to do, to have faith in him and in the fact that France will
live.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These words reveal less about modernism or about the fetish than they do
about a widespread set of attitudes in France in 1941. Stein assimilates
and repeats ideas current at the time--ideas that fit comfortably with
the conservative social politics that she had long been embracing prior
to the war. Chief among the ironies arising from Van Dusen's essay
is the fact that Stein's politics--and even this word, "politics," is
importantly misleading, as we shall see--are, if anything, more openly,
idiosyncratically, and radically disturbing than anything Van Dusen
describes, and they are disturbing in ways profoundly different from
the all-too-familiar ones that Van Dusen articulates.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not only has Van Dusen forgotten important aspects of French history; she
discusses Stein's politics without listening sufficiently to what Stein
has to say on the subject, thereby losing a vitally important perspective
in her eagerness to fit Stein

<B></B>

into a contemporary constellation
of ideas about fascism and modernism. Unlike the revelation of de Man's
wartime writings, the publication of this "Preface" to P&eacute;tain's
speeches will not surprise readers even cursorily familiar with Stein's
opinions during the 1930s and 1940s. To the extent that Stein cared to
express political convictions, by the mid-1930s she had clearly sided
with French conservatives against those communists and constitutionalists
who favored more risky, socially disruptive reforms. Bridgman quotes
a letter, written in 1936, in which Stein notes that many of her
French friends belong to the "Croix de feu"--a nationalistic and
anti-parliamentary organization originally founded by veterans of the
First World War.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Among her associates before and during
the war are the British painter Francis Rose--an admirer of the Nazis
and particular friend of Ernst Roehm, leader of Hitler's storm troopers
(S. A.)--and Bernard F&auml;y, wartime director of the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale and associate of P&eacute;tain.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 There is every
reason to believe that the influence of both men, particularly that
of F&auml;y, helped preserve Stein's and Toklas's property and their
physical safety throughout the war.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further, though her allegiances could and often did place her among
those whose commitments were narrowly and explicitly right-wing, Stein
was by temperament and conviction "conservative" in the word's broadest
sense: she was opposed to change. More particularly, she opposed the
outer-directedness, the expenditure of energy that sociopolitical
labor demands. In her more accessible writing of the 1930s and 1940s,
she repeatedly proclaims that artistic and cultural innovation is best
nurtured by a stable, essentially unchanging social matrix. She explains
her living in France largely by the ease with which her outsider's
status allows her to remain disconnected from French history and
politics. "France was friendly and it let you alone, and so there it was
and there you were," she muses in "An American and France," insisting
that the country and the individual happily occupy quite distinct
locations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 The First World War and the increasingly heated
political debates of the late twenties and the thirties unfortunately
brought these two "there"s closer together, "and so painting has become
Spanish," but the chief glory of French government in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries was its willingness to stay scarcely
visible, like an imperturbable old retainer, in the background of its
citizens' private lives: "It is not what France gave you but what it
did not take away from you that was important."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 "They said
in their revolution Egalit&eacute; Fraternit&eacute; Libert&eacute;,"
Stein recalls in <I>Paris France</I>, as the Germans roll across French
countryside and through French towns, "but these qualities should be left
to war and politics, they are not human."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 She notes ruefully
that "every century has had that dream every revolutionary has that dream,
to destroy the family," but she and her adopted countrymen know better:
"although adolescence and intellectualism demand that he believes in a
world not based upon a family unit, in his heart every Frenchman knows
that that is all there is to it, a family and himself a father of a
family."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 There are potentially powerful ironies operating in
this defense of the family (though the more one reads Stein's public and
private writings, including her letters, the less these words reverberate
with irony), but its conservative bent is consistently reinforced in
Stein's writing. It is

<B></B>

worth registering, after we have taken note
of Stein's right-wing alliances and her allegiance to conservative modes
of thought, that her "politics" are also fundamentally antipathetic to
fascist ideology. She rejects without qualification the collective, the
State as an entity worthy of attention. When a country makes claims of
any sort on its citizens, and when those citizens respond by devoting
themselves to politics in any of its antic guises, whatever springs from
within, from the detached place where creation occurs, will suffer:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Alas the after-war has made France interested in you . . . [B]ut to us who
know France the France that took nothing from you because it was there
and had no need of you not of you but of what anything meant in being

anything from all that was inside them needed to be living.

Living, but not participating or campaigning, not trying to shape events

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's late work, her "politics," and her sense of history can only
be understood if we approach those subjects by way of her extensive
and complex considerations of the faculty of memory and the practice
of forgetting. I take "memory" to designate the symbolic acts by which
we constitute ourselves and position ourselves in time--a definition
proposed by Michael Lambek, an anthropologist and theorist of memory who
usefully reminds us that memory as a practice is in large part socially
mediated and, therefore, a fundamentally moral act. "Rather than treat
memory as a discrete thing, stored and retrieved," Lambek argues,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
or as the biologically innate process of storage and retrieval waiting
to be discovered by the experiments of the psychologist, . . . we
[should] understand it as a culturally mediated expression of the
temporal dimension of experience, in particular of social commitments and
identifications. Remembering comprises contextually situated assertions
of continuity on the part of subjects and claims about the significance
of past experience. Such tacit assertions and claims, based as much on
cumulative wisdom and moral vision as on individual interest, form a
kind of moral practice.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Insofar as the "new" Stein has frequently been discussed in terms that
evoke ethics: insofar as we are searching for a "political" or a socially
engaged Stein, her extensive musings about memory take a new weight,
matter more than they did when she was merely a baffling experimental
writer, a gnomic philosopher. At stake in their interpretation is not
only our assessment of Stein's engagements with P&eacute;tain, but
also our understanding of how we are to discuss politics and modernism
without simply slotting individual modernists into an already familiar
historical narrative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Approaching a study of the past through theories of memory, instead of
convincing us that the past is more intimately and easily available,
more present, emphasizes distances and removals. The complex,
stitched-together tapestries that we make of remembered time are filled
more with holes than cloth. We compose narratives of time past, but
"the smoother the story, the more evident that it is the product of
secondary

<B></B>

reworking." These narratives themselves bear witness to
forgetting, to time not merely past but lost: "It is precisely because
I <I>cannot</I> remember in direct, unmediated fashion the experience
of my childhood," Lambek writes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
that is, can no longer experience as a child, and because cannot remember
directly the events that lead from the infant to the man, that I rely
upon a narrative construction to realize this continuity. Individual
memory, like the narration of the collective we call history, is never
literal reproduction, but an artifice to render the continuity in change
realistic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein, one of our century's most skeptical and thorough students
of memory, repeatedly poses a laconic question in her later work
that suggests the abyss separating past from present, the failure of
recollection to establish continuity: "What is the use of being a little
boy if you are going to grow up to be a man?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 We habitually
fill the present with stories of our childhoods, but those stories
themselves, paradoxically in direct proportion to their completeness
and coherence, testify to how far gone is the child as subject rather
than narrative object.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's conundrum about the radical disjunction between the little boy
and the man encapsulates for her a set of questions about the unavoidable
experiential chasm separating what she variously names "entity" from
"identity"; "the human mind" from "human nature"; "being" from "becoming"
or from "history." The man's past lies at an ontological remove from
his present: "the boy and the man have nothing to do with each other,"
Stein declares in "What Are Master-Pieces?" "except in relation to memory
and identity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 "Identity" is another name for the way we
represent ourselves to ourselves and others (and the ways they choose to
represent us as well). The word comprises the changing sum of portraits
in the gallery named "Gertrude Stein," and when we talk about "human
nature" we use the faculty of memory to generalize from the collection of
rations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 The conscious self necessarily inhabits nothing
more than a brief span of present time. That self remains fundamentally
isolated from other consciousness and is only capable of recalling what
it refers to as "the past" by means of the always-in-progress stories
it tells itself. We inhabit the narrowest of rooms, though we often
hypothesize mansions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In an interview with Robert Haas and William Sutton in 1946, Stein
recalls that in the 1930s, particularly following the publication of
<I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I>, she "became more and more
interested in the subject of narration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 "Subject" here
can designate both the topic of how one tells a story as well as the
"self" composed by narrative means. And yet Stein's convictions that
"if it is inside then there is not there is no time and there is no
identity" (<I>GH</I>,182), and that "genius . . . is the existing
without any internal recognition of time"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 commits her to
a kind of writing that forecloses the possibilities both of "subject"
and "narration" as we usually mean these words. She aspires to solve
"the problem of time in telling a story of anybody" by writing without
recourse to that internal timekeeper, the faculty of memory, and by
dissolving the subject so that we read without trying to plot that
subject's

<B></B>

evolution or its end, without trying to string events
together like fish on a line.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 And she would do this using
a medium that unfolds naturally, inevitably in time. Writing for the
newspapers epitomizes work performed under the temporal constraints
that she resists. Journalists "have to consider not the time in which to
write but the time in which the newspaper is coming out. Three senses of
time to struggle with, the time the event took place, the time they are
writing, and the time it has to come out. Their sense of time cannot be
but false."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Stein works in her fundamentally non-referential vein, leaving
clocks and calendars behind proves relatively easy. "So many words to
use," she muses in <I>The Geographical History of America</I>, and then
rebels against the instrumentality of the verb: "Oh do not say that
words have a use" (<I>GH</I>, 190). But when she turns her attention to
matters of historical record or to contemporary events--to politics and
history, to character sketches of public res--she finds her escape
more complicated. In <I>Everybody's Autobiography</I>, she describes
<I>The Geographical History of America</I>  as a meditation on
the relations between matters of identity and the world's business: "And
so I began to be more and more absorbed in the question of the feeling
of past and present and future inside in one and naturally that led me
later on the subject of history and newspapers to meditate more . . . on
the subject of history and newspapers and politics."

 From
the mid-1930s to the end of her life, Stein writes about the atemporal
"now" of the human mind and the myriad time-inflected snares in which
that mind usually remains caught. The most intimate and fundamental of
these snares we call "identity"; the largest and most grand is named
"history." 1946, the year of her death, finds her still considering:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the essence of narration is this problem of time . . . [Y]ou have to
denude yourself of time so that writing time does not exist. If time
exists, your writing is ephemeral. You can have a historical time,
but for you the time does not exist, and if you are writing about the
present, the time element must cease to exist . . . [In <I>Wars I Have
Seen</I>,] I described something momentous happening under my eyes and
I was able to do it without a great sense of time. There should not be a
sense of time, but an existence suspended in time. That is really where
I am at the present moment. I am still largely meditating about this
sense of time.

"The human mind never does anything," but the world stays busy, and it
is around these different but necessarily related axes of stillness and
motion that <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, Stein's last novel, revolves (<I>CH</I>,
133). By the time Stein composes this novel, she has developed fully her
distinction between human mind and human nature; she has presented her
case against memory and has described and practiced writing that does not
rely on memory. She has been centrally occupied for almost a decade with
"the problem of narration." Now, beginning in 1940 and continuing for the
next two years, as France falls to the Germans, as the geopolitical map of
the world changes from week to week, Stein writes a text that considers
how life might be conducted by Steinian subjects: in part irrevocably
and fundamentally disjunct

<B></B>

from any past or future, balanced on the
narrow, shifting sill of the present moment, but also unavoidably tangled
in each day's unfolding events and utterly obsessed by time past and to
come. The novel concerns itself with "the state of mind" of subjects who
seem unable to assemble themselves internally and who consequently cannot
find convincing rationales for judgments or actions in a world that makes
endless demands for both. Stein does tie herself loosely but decidedly
to time when, in her epilogue to <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, she describes her
effort to present us with "the way anybody could feel these years"--"these
years" being 1940-1943. But we should keep in mind her wry dictum
concerning the misapprehensions necessarily attending the interpretive
activity named "history": "Now history has really no relation to the human
mind at all, because history is the state of confusion between anybody
doing anything and anything happening" (<I>GH</I>, 133).

If one believes that our convictions of agency are the merest fantasies
of power and that the stories we tell about time's passing are founded
on those fantasies, how can one even begin to postulate an ethics? The
world makes us take sides, if only because we chance to be born in one
place and time rather than another, but what can it mean, how can it
matter that we choose to resist or to collaborate, that we side with
P&eacute;tain or Churchill and the Crown, Mussolini or Stalin or Hitler?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Those five great names never find a place on the pages of
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>. The novel--the term is convenient, though
inadequate, insofar as it implies plotted narrative--is a muddy and
incomplete allegory, with a hodgepodge of characters milling around
two men: Angel Harper and Joseph Lane. These two public res, Stein
herself tells us, stand for Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

They are "in the century," part of the century's public story, in a way
that Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds are not.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,
anxious observers of history in progress, are lodged deep within daily
circumstances and cannot be seen from any distance. Stein manages her
novel's characters and its plot using the deliberately creaky apparatus
of prophecy and allegory. Wobbling around the unfocused consciousness of
Mrs. Reynolds, the chapters progress according to Angel Harper's rise
to power as a dictator, his advancing age, and his certain death. This
rise and fall have been foretold in prophesies by the Saints Odile
and Godfrey, whose predictions Stein sets out at length in the opening
pages of her book. From early in the novel, Mrs. Reynolds holds Angel
Harper's death hopefully in sight; on the last page she turns to her
sleepy husband and reminds him that she has not been wrong to believe
in Saint Odile, "because Saint Odile had not been mistaken. Angel Harper
was not fifty-five alive" (<I>MR</I>, 330).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the core of this novel lies the irony that, in the absence of a
firmly internalized sense of time and the stabilizing effects provided
by a belief in memory, an obsession with temporal coordinates dominates
the whole. In a surreal narrative facsimile of daily living without
the faculty of memory, <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> poses the problems Stein
has been considering from primarily philosophical perspectives for more
than a decade prior to its composition. In <I>The Geographical History
of America</I> Stein can write "[t]he relation of human nature to the
human mind makes everybody indifferent to remembering and forgetting to
age and living to knowing that every one can

<B></B>

die so that there may
be room for all who are here now" (<I>GH</I>, 59). In <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>
she places her characters in this indifferent world and she locates
that world, at least to some degree, in time, thereby revealing how vexed
and unsettling are the relations between human mind and human nature,
between the subject to itself and the subject in time. On virtually
every page of this book, with a reiterative logic that makes sense only
if one posits a storyteller plagued by a continuous state of amnesia,
we listen to the narrative tell over a few notches on the stick that
allows it to keep some record of its uncertain temporal place: Angel
Harper's age, Mrs. Reynolds's age, the age of the century, the year as
specified in prophecy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's preoccupations with narrative and memory, with the disjunctions
between the subject's temporally unmoored existence and the object's
embeddedness in time, give this odd book a shape that is often comically
unsophisticated. Having told us that Mrs. Reynolds "was not really
Mrs. Reynolds until she was twenty-three," the book labors to build a
story and to draw a bead on its main character, using the progress toward
twenty-three as temporary telos: "She was nineteen then and then she
was twenty. She was not yet twenty-one" (<I>MR</I>, 17). Mrs. Reynolds
stands only once for a moment before our eyes, early in the novel, held
up for the scrutiny we are accustomed to give res in fiction:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Mrs. Reynolds liked to wear a beret, she was neither dark nor

"Pretty," "small," "tall," "heavy," not dark, not blonde--the first
sentence provides us with almost nothing we can carry away, nothing
to recall. Its measured phrases balance each other like statements on
either side of an equals sign in algebra, canceling each other out. But
then she perhaps pursues invisibility deliberately, given the danger of
the times. The sudden shift from outside to inside, from her beret and
her stature to what she knows, might prompt us to attribute motive and
psychological depth to her lack of distinguishing features. The book,
however, offers no sustained exploration of interiority that might warrant
this reading. All its characters are propelled forward by the ticking
of a clock, the pure passing of time, rather than by any recognizably
internal drives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the absence of character development to keep us oriented in our
reading, the narrative of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> searches constantly
for interpretive shorthand, for ways to anchor perception, keys to
the whirling world. Suppose hair and habits of grooming counted for
something? "If blonde people brush their hair, and make it curl they
are called Gabriel. If dark people brush their hair and it does not
curl, they are called Angel Harper" (<I>MR</I>, 60). Like any number
of similarly crazy forays into logic in this novel, this conditional
assertion can be read as a grim parody of Nazi proclamations about race,
but what is most disturbing about this paragraph is that its confident
illogic is ubiquitous in this book. Mrs. Reynolds, or any of the other
res passing

<B></B>

through these pages, is just as likely to propose
this kind of equation as is Angel Harper or the narrative itself. Rather
than being a moment of merely political satire, this passage speaks to a
pervasive, ontological problem, a bewilderment so profound that politics,
history, ethics, narrative--all that humans build--seems equally flimsy,
equally founded on illusory connections, equally beside the point.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The preeminent ground for studying the odd contours of Steinian history
is the character of Angel Harper himself. Given our knowledge of his
referent in real life--and his connection to Adolph Hitler was noted by
the novel's earliest reviewers--his name presents us with immediate
difficulties. Sounding like a cross between a re from Hardy
and, with the unconcealed pun in his last name, from Bunyan, "Angel
Harper" constitutes one of Stein's most audacious experiments with the
possibility of disconnecting words and things, language and history. To
change "Adolph" to "Angel" is not simply to make a semantic equation
but, as we experience a dissonance in the rechristening, to expose our
presuppositions about how names should fit the world. That is, Stein
presents "Adolph" and "Angel," without commentary, as different, though
similar, collections of letters. Our desire for a semantic order that
corresponds to an ethical one causes us to read the substitution as a
grotesque and deliberate mismatching, an affront to our deepest sense
of order. But then, nothing adds up with Angel Harper. Stein introduces
him in the second chapter of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, and he is from the
outset a character who cannot find a place for himself. In a parody of
portents, Stein obliquely suggests that his birth was accompanied by
signs but then quickly dismisses the relevance of her own suggestion:
"The hoot-owl was hooting terrifically up the valley. Nobody knew just
when or how Angel Harper was born. Not that it made any difference. It
did not" (<I>MR</I>, 38). Whether it is the public's ignorance of the
facts surrounding Angel Harper's birth or the owl's hooting that is
the referent of the "it" in these last two sentences doesn't matter,
since neither explains who this re is or why he developed as he
did. When Stein focuses more intimately on the antagonist who comes to
haunt Mrs. Reynolds, there seems to be nothing inside:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
So he began, being born did not interest him and being dead could not
happen to him and being married was never a possibility for him and
being older as yet was not happening to him and being younger had never
happened to him, so what was the matter. (<I>MR</I>, 38)

Perched precariously in the present on what William James calls the
"saddle-back of time," alone and disconnected, Angel Harper amounts almost
to nothing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Scarcely anything is of consequence; there is
hardly a subject available for description. Stein means "matter" in both
these senses, offering an economical summary of her dwindling character
as subject and object: "Sometimes nothing was the matter." And then,
gathering up what little she can carry away from this early assessment,
she takes stock of all we know: "His name was Angel Harper and sometimes
nothing was the matter" (<I>MR</I>, 38-9).

Even to himself, with a memory that functions only intermittently and
that does not respond to his bidding, Angel Harper is a cipher. Following
a paragraph in which we learn that Mrs. Reynolds's brother was often
unable to "remember what most people whom he knew looked like"--Angel
Harper's failures of memory are by no means anomalous in this book--we
watch Angel Harper try to pull himself together:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

But Angel Harper was completely like that, he would begin trying to

In Martin Amis's <I>Time's Arrow</I> (London: Jonathan Cape, 1991), the
narrative "I" tells the story of the novel's central character, a Nazi
doctor, backwards, from death to birth. Entirely lacking the faculty of
memory, since time runs backward, effect precedes cause, and there is
no past to recall in the present, the "I" is cut off from the identity
of this person whose body and mind he inhabits. The narrator watches,
trapped, bemused, amoral, as the thing with a name, an identity to use
Stein's terms, moves confusingly through the world. <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>
is Stein's earlier version of the puzzle Amis makes, though it lacks the
morally redemptive satirical thrust of <I>Time's Arrow</I>. It is a book
filled with res (human minds) whose identities (human natures) are
attached loosely to them like sets of ill-fitting garments, res who
possess a consciousness, an "I," but little more. When Angel Harper even
considers telling his life story, he finds that "[h]e could not think in
that way, he could not remember, he only remembered what he left." His
past has not completely vanished; it lies in abandoned pieces behind him,
"left" rather than narratively gathered up and brought with him into now:
"Little by little he tried to remember what he had but he never could,
he could only remember what he left" (<I>MR</I>, 85).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The true horror of Stein's Angel Harper is that, because he lacks the
ability to forge a narrative from events, he is utterly amoral. His
actions are unmotivated, and his thoughts are disconnected from those
actions. As Laurence Kirmayer succinctly puts it, "[t]he moral function
of memory is to compel us to confront what we--and all around us--wish to
leave behind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The canvas of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> is dotted
with brief recollected vignettes from Angel Harper's childhood, but Angel
Harper's past has for him no gravity, nor does he live in the present as
though his actions will become part of a burden he must carry. Instead
of providing us with explanatory frames for understanding, glimpses of
psychosis or sociopathology in embryo, his memories stand isolated from
the paragraphs around them and from the recollecting subject himself. The
trigger for each memory is invariably nothing more than time: "When he
was forty-three," a typical episode begins, "he remembered that when he
was thirteen he would sit by a drain and whisper in it to some one on
the other side of it" (<I>MR</I>, 109). The memories are often vaguely
disturbing, but nothing analytically or emotionally productive arises
from these disturbances:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[W]hen he was forty-four he remembered that when he had been fourteen, he
played a game and each one, not he but each one around him had a knife,
and each one came up to him and whispered something to him and he did not
whisper anything . . . When he was forty-four he remembered about this
that it had been happening when he was fourteen. (<I>MR</I>, 118-19)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Enough said," the next paragraph begins, and the adolescents with their
knives and their whispers fade from view. Angel Harper suffers from angst
but not remorse, from unfocused anxiety but not guilt. Even recollections
that, with a small degree of psychologically coherent treatment, might
serve as keys to character are either simply abandoned or are turned by
the narrative into occasions for wordplay:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[W]hen he was fifty-three he remembered that when he was fifteen he asked
them to make a very small enclosure of stone and in that in a chair he
sat alone and sometimes  he let another boy sit in there with him and
near him he let a little girl make a little park with flowers and when
he was fifty-three he remembered all that. (<I>MR</I>, 276)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Echoing Stein's conundrum about the man's inability to recall the
little boy who preceded him, the narrative following this memory
expresses surprise that the fifty-three-year-old Angel Harper even
found this piece of his childhood floating into his field of vision:
"He might not have remembered all that, because when he was fifty-three
there was not much to remember at, because he often felt very different
from any day to any day" (<I>MR</I>, 276). The paragraph then takes a
conspicuous turn away from analysis and toward poetry, with rhythm and
rhyme seeming to determine sense. The word "Jew" (it is impossible to
imagine three letters that carry a stronger ethical and political charge
in the early 1940s) occurs mostly because it is a word that rhymes with
so many other words. Here is more medium than message, on an occasion
when a moral order would demand a message:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What shall I do he said if I am or if I am not a Jew, what shall I do he
said, he was fifty-three and he was not lonesome and he was not subdued,
he was very rude, not rude to himself because although he was afraid he
went away to go ahead and he never never went to bed. So one at a time
there was no time. (<I>MR</I>, 277)

There is, as Stein said of <I>Wars I Have Seen</I>, "something momentous
happening" somewhere behind the words of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, but, with
every character and the narrative voice all being "existences suspended in
time," we cannot make supportable leaps from those words to the world. In
a masterful paragraph of suggestive but untranslatable comparisons,
Mrs. Reynolds attempts to locate Angel Harper on an occupational
spectrum, to put him convincingly next to any other person. "Nobody
asked her," the passage wryly begins--why should the opinion of a
Mrs. Reynolds matter?--"but what did she think of him." In the absence
of an interlocutor, the occasion for speech must be rhetorical:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

She thought that he was not as useful as a plumber and more dangerous, she
thought that he was not as useful as an electrician but more violent, she
thought that he was not as regular as a gardener but more destructive,
she thought that he was more solemn than a baker but more fiery, and
she thought he was not as bloody as a butcher but more deceitful, and
then she burst out into hysterical laughter and Mr. Reynolds said what
is it, and she said it is Angel Harper and he is fifty just fifty going
on being fifty, and if, and she gave a deep sigh if he only never came
to be fifty-one. (<I>MR</I>, 188)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mrs. Reynolds, rarely caught in "the state of confusion between anybody
doing anything and anything happening," typically concludes her musings
on Angel Harper's dangerous progress with a prayer that his time run
out--that he not be allowed to "go on being" whatever age he happens
to be. Another way to put this is to say that Mrs. Reynolds shares
her creator's skepticism, her passivity concerning cause and effect
and action. For her, the present lies contiguous to but not obviously
connected to the past and future.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Stein too, she would prefer to be disconnected from the
responsibility that memory entails: "Mrs. Reynolds said she wished
that she was a cow and then she would only know now, and not about the
clock going back" (<I>MR</I>, 221). If one is lost in the beguiling
pages of <I>The Geographical History of America</I> or in "What are
Master-Pieces?" living entirely in the "now" of the human mind may seem
liberating. The attempt looks somewhat different--and Stein knows that it
looks different--on the pages of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, where we discover
a state of mind that is historical in spite of itself. In 1936 Stein
could protest that "[t]he newspapers tell about events but what have
events to do with anything nothing" (<I>GH</I>, 95). Now it is the early
1940s and, in a fine moment of sardonic comedy that has as its target
both Mrs. Reynolds and Gertrude Stein, we hear Mrs. Reynolds talking to
her husband: "Mr. Miner says, said Mrs. Reynolds to Mr. Reynolds that
there is a great difference between there was an army and there is an
army" (<I>MR</I>, 248). The problem Stein sets for herself (and for the
anxious heroine of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>) is how to register the fact of
this terrible difference without succumbing entirely to the newspapers,
to the clock ticking regularly inside as well as outside her head, to
the obligations and the false sense of agency that memory entails. How
to avoid the easy, unpleasant, and unproductive slide into materialism
that leads straight to the dullest forms of narrative but yields nothing
of aesthetic or philosophical value?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Bearing comparison with the H.D. of "Trilogy" or the Yeats of <I>A
Vision</I>, Stein in <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> discovers that prophecy--in
particular, the prophetic voices of Saint Odile and Saint Godfrey--allows
time into the world she creates without requiring that she also import
memory, or human agency, or a developed political or ethical system. Stein
herself avidly read and recounted to her friends during the war the work
of a "Leonardo Blake," an English astrologer whose two books, <I>Hitler's
Last Year of Power</I>  and <I>The Last Year of the War</I> 
provide much of the structure and rationale for <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>. Both
books, filled with the horoscopes of leaders and nations, are saturated
with dates and magisterial pronouncements that bear particular resonance
for anyone who has been reading Stein. "Men only think they

<B></B>

are
the makers of history," Blake insists, but "[a]ctually there is being
staged in Europe to-day the greatest puppet-show in the history of
man."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 "For the prophet," Blake writes, "there is neither
past, present, nor future. To him all Time is an eternal present. Thus,
what is to come is as evident to him as what has past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

Writing from the perspective of Yeats's Chinamen in "Lapis Lazuli,"
sounding a bit like the impersonal poet in Eliot's "Tradition and the
Individual Talent," Blake says: "I have written this book not because
I am an adversary of the Nazi regime (for the true astrologer is far
removed from any kind of party politics and prejudices)."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

"The astrologer who genuinely desires to help those around him," Blake
continues, "must first liberate himself from his own ego . . . In
interpreting the cosmic law, it is not a subjective perception that
matters, but an objective perception of the whole secret fabric of
creation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The promise that Blake holds for Stein is order and answers--repose in
a deeply conservative system that does not even require the knowledge,
much less the assent or participation of the actors caught up in
their strictly assigned parts. There is a folder among Stein's papers
at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library at Yale University
filled with typed and handwritten prophesies, copied at different
times and from different sources. Two of those prophesies, those of
Saints Odile and Godfrey, make their way almost verbatim into the text
of <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 It is fitting that Stein, in a
willing abdication of her role as author, had only to act as a conduit
for the wisdom of the stars, copying these maps of the future into her
book. In order to clarify how fully prophecy is memory's antagonist, we
might briefly consider Henri Bergson's central argument in his <I>Matter
and Memory</I> (1896, trans. 1911). Memory for Bergson is the faculty
that is "placed at the confluence of mind and matter." It binds ideas
to the real; it attaches consciousness to the world with our body at
that world's center:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Do we turn to memory? We note that its primary function is to evoke all
those past perceptions which are analogous to the present perception,
to recall to us what preceded and followed them, and so to suggest to us
that decision which is the most useful. But this is not all. By allowing
us to grasp in a single intuition multiple moments of duration, it frees
us from the movement of the flow of things, that is to say, from the
rhythm of necessity.

One cannot imagine a more profound nightmare for Mrs. Reynolds than
this freedom from the comforting rhythm of what must be. "Dear me,"
she sighs late in Stein's chronicle of her days, "it is so tiresome
not to know what is going to be happening" (<I>MR</I>, 246). Bergson's
memory suspends us above time's flow only long enough for us to make a
choice and then plunge willingly in again; Blake and the Saints offer
Mrs. Reynolds and her creator another way out.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what makes <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> a compelling and complex portrait
of "the way anybody could feel" during the war are the difficulties
Mrs. Reynolds has in taking consolation from her saints. Predictions
should palliate anxiety: "Mrs. Reynolds said

<B></B>

she felt very
complicated this morning and so she would calm herself by reading
the predictions of Saint Odile" (<I>MR</I>, 277). But every
calm, uncomplicated morning in this book is thrown off kilter by
subsequent doubts. It is not easy to rest outside of time: "Dear me said
Mrs. Reynolds if I knew how to be patient and I know how to be impatient I
would know that everything is imminent" (<I>MR</I>, 325). Over and over,
with increasing frequency as the book progresses and Angel Harper lives
year after costly year, the narrator must assure us that Mrs. Reynolds's
faith has not waned. "[S]he had not weakened, she was still choosing Saint
Odile" (<I>MR</I>, 291), we learn at one of the points in the novel where
Stein reveals the current date (it is 1942). It is hardly surprising
that in this grim year Mrs. Reynolds confesses on the following page:
"I weakened a little bit" (<I>MR</I>, 292). Like Stein, she finds it
necessary to write Saint Odile's words over, since "when she made a copy
of it she believed it all again" (<I>MR</I>, 233).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

a decade earlier, in 1926, Stein had told the audiences at Cambridge and
Oxford that "beginning again and again" was of central importance to
her work.

 In this late and guardedly historical fiction,
repetition derives from the pervasive sense that nothing provides a
purchase on the world. Mrs. Reynolds, having renounced the internal
chronology provided by memory, has to begin every day again, trying to
conjure some sense into time's passing and find some tranquility in her
powerlessness. Late in the novel, long after we have heard the full text
of Saint Odile's prophecy repeated several times, Mrs. Reynolds comes
excitedly home to her patient, skeptical, agreeable husband:

and now I am only waiting for the ting in the streets of the city
of cities, to believe that Saint Odile is right and of course Saint
Odile is right and it is all the same, and said Mrs. Reynolds even if
it does not make any difference to me and in a way it does not make any
difference to me but I have not a restless feeling but an underground
happy feeling that it is all the same . . . and you are all the same

Stein makes narrative either something impossible to discover--in her
opaque prose-poetry--or, as here, she saturates it with comedy--the often
dark comedy of disjunctions arising from any structure that makes the
absurd claim: "first X then Y." Instead we have X, then X again, with
the corollary that we cannot keep track of the Xs, since each fades so
quickly from our memory after its iteration. Each statement is wholly
new, entirely and perpetually modern, though in its very novelty, its
singularity, it destroys even the possibility that we might assign it a
temporal position. Stein is most modern in her idiosyncratic, longstanding
preoccupation with memory, forgetting, and the structures created by
the endless interplay between recollection and amnesia. "Thinking,"
she admits, "is something that does so nearly need to be memory," but
she nevertheless continues to attempt to dissever the mind from its

<B></B>

milieus.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Positioning her historically requires that
we honor fully her resistance to being "placed" historically at all,
and we can only honor that resistance by taking it seriously enough to
observe Stein's own writing of that resistance deeply into the details
of her narratives.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In her "Epilogue" to <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, immediately preceding her
final sentence tying history to a "state of mind," Stein describes how
"the shadow of two men" (Hitler and Stalin) "gets bigger and then blows
away and there is no other" (<I>MR</I>, 331). No legacy, then, of the
War--nothing to remember, no stories really worth telling. If we care
to, we can read the newspapers. Of course she knows that most of us
will not or cannot let the past simply blow away. She knows, too, since
she herself is not consistently able to turn the world and its activity
into shadows or puppet shows, that we will continue to worry, as will
she, over politics and the shape of our futures. But she believes her
most important labor to be elsewhere--on a project so different from our
current preoccupations in the academy that it proves difficult even to
discern or credit. Stein aspires to live in what Eliot described, in the
greatest modern poetic treatment of memory and the possibilities of living
within and outside of time, as "the unimaginable / Zero summer"--where,
in her own phrase, "everything is imminent" and nothing is happening.

The critical practice that promises to situate a text most firmly,
most literally in time is textual scholarship. Think of <I>Ulysses</I>
or, their every word plotted on a retrospectively assembled <I>The
Waste Land</I> calendar of composition. Jerome McGann concludes <I>The
Textual Condition</I> proclaiming that all events "[localize] human
temporalities." "To the interpreter," he writes, "texts often appear
as the images of time; to the maker of texts, however, they are the
very events of time and history itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
The finished text
constitutes, in its procession of letters across the page, a memorial to
time's passing in the life of its author. Drafts of that text offer an
even more obvious witness to temporality. As the textual critic makes
an ordered gathering of earlier versions, he or she fully exposes the
diachronic nature of writing. McGann reminds us that "[v]ariation . . . is
the invariant rule of the textual condition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Like markings
on the face of a clock, variants provide us with a way to calibrate the
author's labor and to tie her changing words to time. But Stein proves
every bit as difficult to fix on any textual clock as she is resistant
to location in occupied France. When we turn to her drafts, prompted by
a desire to glimpse the author at work, what we find disrupts one of the
founding premises of textual scholarship: that texts evolve over time. On
this most fundamental level--the level of writing itself--Stein forces
us to consider the philosophical and procedural difficulties attending
all epistemologies that privilege temporal, historical categories of
understanding.

<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I> provided us with a textual locus for examining
Stein's complex positioning of a subject in historical time. To focus
my discussion of her equally complex and closely related compositional
practice, I turn to a long essay she sometimes called "Phenomena of
Nature," sometimes "Natural Phenomena." She composed the essay in
1925-1926; it was first published posthumously in the <I>Yale
Gertrude Stein</I>

<B></B>

. I choose this essay in large part because
we are fortunate to have, among Stein's papers at the Beinecke library,
textual witnesses from each of her three characteristic compositional
stages. These stages have been described with admirable clarity by Ulla
Dydo, a pioneer in the study of Stein's manuscripts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 For
"Phenomena of Nature," an essay that has received very little attention
in print, we have eight surviving <I>carnets</I>--the small copybooks
in which Stein composed the earliest drafts of her work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>

We have a complete set of twenty-five <I>cahiers</I>--larger notebooks
that contain a manuscript transcription of the essay. And we have the
full typescript, used to set the text for publication in 1955. Though
Stein wrote this piece twenty years before writing <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>,
and though she, her writing, and the world changed enormously in the
intervening years, the means by which she builds "Phenomena of Nature" are
directly and revealingly comparable to the way she tells her anti-temporal
historical narrative of the Second World War.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's career has been more or less usefully divided into phases by a
number of her critics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 In her autobiographical writings,
Stein herself energetically promoted this practice of partitioning. And
these divisions can come to seem like uncrossable borders to Stein's
critics: what has her work of the mid-1920s to do with a novel composed
in the early 1940s? But "Phenomena of Nature" and <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>
belong together in a discussion of Stein, memory, and critical locations
of her in "place, time, life, history, materiality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 A
writer's habits of work reveal fundamental assumptions about the world
and the place of the writer and her writing in that world. In Stein's
case, the way she writes, the way she moves through successive versions
of a text, constitutes the methodological foundation of her assault
against the reign of memory, the tyrannies of time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By way of illustrating the challenge Stein presents to textual
scholarship, I quote three sentences from the first portion of
"Phenomena of Nature" for which we have draft evidence. Here are
the sentences as they first appear in pencil on a page from the
<I>carnet</I>: "They hate sitting, sitting where, sitting there and
being allowed to sit anywhere. In what way is this their seat and
seated. Believing in chance" (92:1716). Here are those sentences
in their final, printed version: "They hate sitting, sitting where,
sitting there and being allowed to sit anywhere. In what way is this
their seat and seated. Believing in chance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 We can find
twenty-eight draft passages for "Phenomena of Nature" scattered among
the eight <I>carnets</I>. We can count on one hand the instances of
deletions at this earliest compositional stage. There are virtually no
instances of interpolations. Even the tiniest details of punctuation
and capitalization are, for the most part, set from the start. Except
for what seem to be occasional slips of the pen, the text as it appears
in the <I>cahiers</I> is identical to the published version. It is
difficult to convey fully how odd these notebooks first appear to one
accustomed to making discoveries in drafts. The term "draft" itself,
though useful as a term to distinguish Stein's first, handwritten copy
of a text from a later, printed version, is misleading insofar as it
implies a preliminary sketch or rough version.

In an essay on Virginia Woolf and textual criticism, Brenda Silver
remarks that "[o]nce seen, once read, the words and images found in
the previous versions shadow and illuminate the impressions we receive
from the familiar words on the well-thumbed page and create something
new."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 Stein's essay startles because its drafts cast
almost no shadows, because we discover, when we fix our attention
on what preceded the present text, sameness rather than difference:
Narcissus staring in the silvered pool; Echo following in the track of
every prior utterance. There are, it is true, slight variations at each
of the essay's stages of composition. <I>Carnets</I>, <I>cahiers</I>,
typescript, and typeset versions each posses significantly different
bibliographic codes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 And the <I>carnets</I> are filled with
a complex assembly of other writings to which I will return. But I dwell
first on the extraordinary unnaturalness of "Natural Phenomena" in its
earliest form. The sentences in their first and final versions, ending
as they began, complete a circle that obscures from our view evidence
of the author's earliest intentions and of changes to those intentions;
of problems encountered and overcome or left unresolved in the course
of composition; of expressive alterations in the design of details or
of the whole. They leave us with a starkly simple text that speaks of
presence rather than growth. "Phenomena of Nature" is, in an important
sense, an essay without a past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dydo has pointed out that Stein herself claimed "she did not believe in
revision, for if writing involved the perception of the here and now,
revisions were bound to force a text into a different here and now,
which required different verbal forms."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 But Dydo's own
work, particularly her discussion of "Stanzas in Meditation," dwells
on Stein's comparatively few but powerfully significant revisions, and
Dydo assures us that "[e]ven pieces that show no evidence of revision
were not tossed off without the hard work and concentrated effort
that Stein called <I>meditation</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Dydo's defensive
pronouncement demonstrates, among other things, how much traditional
scholarship relies on drafts to document an author's worth. Evidence
of extensive labor helps guarantee the value we ascribe to the final
text. The criticisms brought against Stein during her lifetime and
after her death--we need only think of Wyndham Lewis, sneering at the
"sodden lustreless heaping up of sheer meaningless material"--could be
so much more easily dispensed with if there were some equivalent to
the forty-nine notebooks marshaled behind the published <I>Finnegans
Wake</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 But it is perhaps necessary to add, before I turn
to a detailed description of the textual witnesses for "Phenomena of
Nature," that I do not intend to propose evaluative judgments of Stein's
work based on her compositional practices. Her improvisatory method does
raise important questions about how audiences determine aesthetic value
and how we might interpret writing that reaches publication without
evidence of revision. But my primary concern here is to examine and
explain the epistemological convictions that underwrite Stein's way of
making "Phenomena of Nature." It should also be understood that Stein does
not write all of her work in the same fashion. She generally composes her
more accessible, more openly referential writing in a manner familiar
to textual scholars. She works from notes through changing drafts to a
final version. "Natural Phenomena" provides us with an unusually rich
illustration

<B></B>

of an alternative path to completion--a path Stein
tends to follow as she creates her less referential texts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Phenomena of Nature" is a little over twenty thousand words in length. It
is reasonable to suppose that Stein drafted the entire composition
in <I>carnets</I> before she and Alice Toklas copied the material to
<I>cahiers</I>. The eight relevant <I>carnets</I> contain a total of
twenty-eight sections from the essay--some as short as forty words,
most falling somewhere between two and four hundred words. Interspersed
with these pieces of "Phenomena of Nature" are love notes and drawings
to Alice; miscellaneous lists--lists of names, of the day's necessary
groceries, of titles; various addresses; agendas for the day or the week;
reading notes; sums; drafts of letters; and pieces of other compositions
that Stein was concurrently writing: "Business in Baltimore," "A Novel
of Thank You," "A Third."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Alice often responds to Stein's
notes; she also occasionally uses the <I>carnets</I> for her own lists
and daily jottings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The writing in the <I>carnets</I> is usually inverted about halfway
through each notebook: the reader must turn the notebook over at the
midpoint and begin afresh from the other end. Sometimes there will be
a page in the middle of a <I>carnet</I> where the two halves of the
book meet and the inverted writing lies interlineated, like Leopold and
Molly Bloom in bed. While Stein does not break sections of "Phenomena
of Nature" at these points of inversion, she may continue composing the
same text after turning the <I>carnet</I> over and beginning to work her
way toward the middle of the notebook from the other cover.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>

The sequence of sections within each <I>carnet</I> rarely follows the
sequence in the final "Phenomena of Nature," and the material from a given
<I>carnet</I>, if that <I>carnet</I> contains more than one portion of the
essay, can be distributed over anywhere from two to eight pages of the
final text.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 This is an essay assembled at the level of the
<I>cahiers</I>, built like a mosaic out of the tesserae that are the short
bits of prose selected from the <I>carnets</I>. We have at most a third of
the <I>carnet</I> witnesses for this text. As Stein pieced "Phenomena of
Nature" together, she would have been choosing passages from a large stack
of little notebooks, each of which already constituted an extraordinarily
heterogeneous collection of writings. I cannot imagine the essay coming
from fewer than twenty <I>carnets</I>; there could conceivably have
been twice that number. Joyce's large envelopes stuffed with disparate
material for chapters of <I>Ulysses</I> come to mind, as do Woolf's 1930s
scrapbooks that lie behind <I>The Years</I> and <I>Three Guineas</I>, but
these famously scattered archives ultimately yield wholes, even though
those final texts are in part designed to let readers see that the book
they read was built from snippets. Stein's mosaic does not produce a
picture of anything, nor does it reveal a pattern. We must read as she
wrote, moving from one small unit to the next, never trying to back up
far enough that we can forget the compositional medium and dwell instead
on any resemblance to something we might vaguely denominate "life."

Stein's discovery of a method for disassembling books as she reads will
come as "regrettable" news to all the readers and writers who prefer that
language remain subordinate, in the service of narrative. It becomes
clear, when working segment by segment through the <I>carnets</I>
(particularly if one is transcribing every word), that Stein composes
in these little books partly to frustrate any impulses she might have
toward forcing her words to amount to something grand.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With a <I>carnet</I> open before her, she could never even see more than
twenty or thirty words at one time. Switching from one work-in-progress
to another, and frequently shifting registers entirely (sandwiching,
say, a menu for tomorrow's dinner or a love note with an accompanying
page of sketches between part of "Phenomena of Nature" and "Business
in Baltimore"), she would find it virtually impossible to establish a
narrative line. Stein demarcates sections of her works with short title
headings--"P. of N ." or "N .P ."; "B. in B ."; "Novel"; "A Third"--that
already signal a breakdown of wholes into parts. We find no regular order
and no set length of the sections. Stein occasionally superimposes one
section title on another, changing her direction the way an improvising
musician may suddenly change key or tempo. Sometimes the superimposition
occurs in an obviously different pencil: she may have returned to an
already drafted section and reassigned its location; she might have left
a heading for herself that she later decided not to use; she might simply
have changed her mind as she was picking up another pencil. She had a
definite but shifting sense, as she was writing, of what she wanted to be
composing, and the <I>carnets</I> allow her to honor the vagaries of her
desire, their rules of assembly insisting all the while that the desire
remain vagrant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Though there are instances where the ending
of one section has obviously triggered a word or phrase in the next, there
are not overarching themes or even substantial and sustained verbal echoes
binding sections together.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 <I>Carnets</I> have the unity
granted them by the physical fact that each is a separate book, but they
are not collections of fragments shored or bound together--not a <I>Waste

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or perhaps, if we were so inclined and if Stein did not warn us so
vehemently against the activity, we could make these little notebooks
cohere as fully as do any of those differently disheveled monuments. When
we see words in a book, we move naturally and expediently to connect
them with one another and to have them point to something. The fact of
that pointing itself then bespeaks unity of purpose and design. The
problem of referentiality--and for Stein it is a problem precisely
because

<B></B>

readers remain incorrigibly interested in words' capacity
to evoke images of "whole things"--haunts the interpretive history of
Stein's opaque writings and is staged as both problem and blessing with
extraordinary vividness throughout the <I>carnets</I>. Once we have read
the <I>carnets</I> for "Phenomena of Nature," particularly when we have
discovered the notes between Gertrude and Alice, it is difficult to read
the published essay only as Stein wants us to, concentrating on words
"one at a time," without any "remembering or forgetting." The unrevised
manuscript origins of "Phenomena of Nature" present us with a powerful
witness to Stein's attempt at banishing memory from the process of
composition, her refusal of what McGann calls "the textual condition." But
we find these portions of "Natural Phenomena" adjacent to very different
kinds of writing. At the farthest extreme from the polished surfaces of
"Phenomena of Nature" are Stein's notes to Alice, which exhibit language
in its most deeply and privately referential aspect. Stein's meditative
writing for publication is the product of the human mind; love letters
are, of all kinds of writing, the genre belonging most fully to human
nature, predicated as they are on memory and voice, designed expressly
to evoke the absent beloved. Filled with both kinds of writing, the
<I>carnets</I> simultaneously celebrate and eschew reference.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I do not turn to Stein's private writing so that I may crack the code
of "Natural Phenomena." I am not interested in cross-referential
interpretations that will uncover love letters in Stein's public
works. The particular importance of the <I>carnets</I> as I read them
is that they reveal Stein moving among various linguistic registers,
considering different ways of deploying words, and they thereby
constitute a crucial, underutilized locus for observing her shifting
as a writer between human mind and human nature. In addition to reading
her pronouncements concerning the differences between these two states
of being, we can observe her negotiating their different demands on the
pages of these little books.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The notes to and from Alice do not remain neatly cordoned off from the
other writings in the <I>carnets</I>, though one might suppose they do
from Dydo's description of them in "Reading the Hand Writing":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Often (Stein) began work in a <I>carnet</I> by pencilling little
love notes, jingles, intimate addresses, and sometimes drawings to
Toklas. These notes are written in a tiny, thin, "secret" hand to offset
them from actual compositions. None are literary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is in fact most provocative about this intimate writing to Alice
is that it spills over into adjacent sections. It is by no means always
written in a "secret hand"; there are no dependably consistent, convenient
graphic signals that warn us when we have moved from literature to
love, from "actual composition" to something more private. The notes
do regularly occur as invocations at the beginning of a <I>carnet</I>
(or at both beginnings, since the inverted writing in the <I>carnets</I>
can be said to give each notebook two beginnings), but they can turn up
anywhere between the covers. When we have read a handful of these notes,
becoming steeped in their characteristic turns of phrase and attuned to
their typical vocabulary, we cannot read the public

<B></B>

"Phenomena of
Nature" or the private letters to Alice without hearing echoes between
theoretically distinct kinds of writing. Human mind and human nature,
it turns out, share a good deal of the same vocabulary. Even if one
reads word by word, determined to look neither forward nor backward for
wholes, language is a vexing medium for the human mind to use. Paint or
sound seem inherently more promising. Words are like burrs: they stick
so readily to the fabric of the world, to our lives, our recollected
pasts, our vividly experienced presents, our imagined futures. Stein
treats her medium in the <I>carnet</I>s as an improvising musician treats
notes--building without erasure or backtracking (except as repetition
with change constitutes a form of serial revision in which the earlier
version also remains present on the completed page). But insofar as her
reader holds the <I>carnets</I> in his or her memory, parts of "Phenomena
of Nature" can carry complex attractive charges, recalling adjacent and
differently directed writing from the <I>carnets</I>. I said earlier
that the drafts for "Phenomena of Nature" cast no shadows. That was
not entirely true. Those drafts are surrounded by shadows--writing that
remembers, writing that recalls and anticipates items, places, people,
ideas, the body, the presence of the beloved. To read the <I>carnets</I>
is to watch Stein (and to imagine Alice) crossing the vaguely demarcated
boundary between referential writing and the writing without precedent
or elsewheres that is "Natural Phenomena."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consider two pages from one of the <I>carnets</I>. Stein has been
composing "N.P.": "She does not like a flower to droop its head and so
instead she pours a little water in its bed. And she noticed it and told
me and I was pleased to hear about it although just then although just
then" (1734; <I>NP</I>, 194). The next page begins with a parenthetical
aside to Alice (and perhaps, as a reminder, to Gertrude as well)--"(this
is separate)"--followed by a brief, typical "note to tell my wifie
that I can quote and that I wrote and that she will have come out a
cow now now how, sweetly" . The parenthesis claiming separation
is necessary only because the passage from "Phenomena of Nature," in
its preciousness, its intimate focus on nurturing, on conversation, on
giving and pleasure, slips easily into the genre of the love letter
as Stein's practice in the <I>carnets</I> has defined it. But these
qualities of intimacy that I have ascribed to the passage from "Phenomena
of Nature" must always remain purely potential and must depend on what
any reader chooses to remember from the drafts, and who we imagine the
audience of these words to be. The words will never simply and purely
possess their possibly intimate inflections on the pages of "Phenomena
of Nature," if only because Stein worked diligently and explicitly, in
theory and practice, to unsettle interpretive arrivals and resolutions,
especially resolutions that produce a body, a personality, an identity
as the endpoint of reading.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is mistaken to propose, as Dydo does, that "a full study of the Stein
autograph notebooks can make works accessible that have been considered
hermetic or incomprehensible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 Nor, I think, should we
use the drafts to discover, at a particular moment in a published text,
that "[p]lainly Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas are quarreling," or to
find that "'Natural Phenomena' . . . ends with a tiny dialogue that is

<B></B>

undoubtedly an exchange between Stein and Toklas: 'I choose you. I
choose you too.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 When she uses the <I>carnets</I> as a key,
Dydo confounds different orders of writing. These words might once have
formed part of an exchange between people, and the <I>carnets</I>--hybrids
of journal and draft--encourage reading across genres. But when Stein
folds "I choose you" into "Natural Phenomena," the possibility that she
spoke these words to Alice gets us almost nowhere in the interpretive
thicket of Stein's text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or nowhere legitimate: manuscripts for radically challenging texts
invariably tempt us with the lure that we will uncover intelligible
guides to the whole at an earlier compositional stage. And yet we should
recall A. Walton Litz's admonition in the preface to his book on Joyce's

already spent considerable time in the Joyce archives, Litz confesses:

produced by other kinds of criticism. The irreducible gap between

always in plain view, not in the dark corners explored by the genetic
or biographical critic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This warning fits Stein's case just as perfectly as it does Joyce's. Like
Joyce in his late work, Stein concentrates on linguistic surfaces in
a great deal of her writing, and finding sources for verbal details,
while it may prove satisfying and may even offer spurious comfort in
the face of mystery, will never compel the words before us to arrange
themselves in a referential order. The <I>carnets</I> hold a vast array
of samplings from all the kinds of language we use to bind our lives
together, and Stein picks from among those languages as she practices
her art. But the <I>carnets</I>, when placed beside her finished work,
do not give us plain quarrels in that work, or transcribed conversations,
or circumstances formerly concealed, or readings that are, at last, true
and wholly accurate to a world lying somewhere off the page. One can,
of course, weave snippets from the public work back into an account of
Stein's daily, private life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Her words and phrases are
available for this more lucid use. One of the chief lessons of the
<I>carnets</I>, however, lies in the proximity of different kinds of
writing and in our desire, when confronted with these various writings, to
seek out references and make narratives, even after Stein has told us that
she has little interest in narrative lines or in words pointing to things.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can find evidence of this desire at work in Alice Toklas herself, as
she read and transcribed from the <I>carnets</I> in the days following
Stein's nocturnal labor. Clearly Alice expected both manuscript texts and
notes from her lover. Part of the intrigue for her as a reader of these
notebooks would have been the uncertain aura of many passages--love letter
or word-by-word writing? Both? As she turned pages she would suddenly
find words for herself. "You write a note to me," Alice plaintively
demands at one point. "I do I have," Stein responds , and it is
possible to see in Stein's terse rejoinder a comment about the way she
can be writing in part to Alice

<B></B>

even if the heading on a page reads
"P. of N." or "B. in B." I often found myself uncertain, as I transcribed
<I>carnets</I>, about what kind of writing I was reading and to whom it
was addressed. Here is an exemplary passage, chosen almost at random: "And
when she likes it when they do do it it is when they do do it that she
likes it. It is when she likes and she has the way of having heard that
she was satisfied with what had been heard earnestly" . Two pages
before these sentences, Stein has written "A Third" as a heading, but
the words on this page might also find a private and particular reader.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Stein, though, as for Nietzsche before her, to be a modern
who can write or read master-pieces, one must cultivate the "power
of forgetting, or, in more learned phrase, the capacity of feeling
'unhistorically.'"

 She would have us suppress our editorial
training, our inclination to unsnarl manuscript tangles, draw diagrams,
place texts carefully in historical time. She would teach us not
to concern ourselves with finding love letters buried in her public
writings, not to chase after the scent of reference in the hopes of
catching real people, tangible places, actual things hiding in their
lairs. The <I>carnets</I> for "Phenomena of Nature" provide us with a
text framed by temporalities but also outside of time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Throughout the <I>carnets</I> and in Stein's more public texts, we find
a talismanic sentence whose changing meanings speak to how Stein's ideal,
empty writing and perfectly forgetful audience might come gradually into
being: "When this you see remember me." The injunction--so old, so often
repeated that it cannot be said to have an author--belongs especially to
the folk-art tradition of the sampler. It was stitched into countless
borders, usually by children and adolescent girls, and often made one
line of a brief verse concerning mortality. A characteristic example,
dated 1739, tells the reader,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Many such verses also had the sampler-maker's name appended. But what
do names and dates mean when tied to such conventional and endlessly
reiterated writing? As the sampler leaves immediate kin for wider and
more temporally distant worlds, "when this you see remember me" turns
from a prayer for remembrance into a memorial to forgetting, a monument
to the absences of author and recipient. The phrase becomes an emblem
for words' tendency to lose their private resonances for more public,
general meanings. Language does tend to evoke the world, but it proves a
porous receptacle for intimacies. Given a little time, even the poignant
injunction to "remember me" can become an assembly of letters on a piece
of cloth--simply language.

If we read Stein's "Introduction to the Speeches of Mar&eacute;chal
P&eacute;tain" in the context of the contemporaneous <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>,
with an understanding of Stein's deep, interconnected skepticisms
concerning the operations of memory, historical narratives,

<B></B>

explanations of political and military events, and stories built
around the development of character, we discover something much more
complicated and peculiar than another instance of "modernism's complicity
with conservative--even fascist--impulses."
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Van Dusen's
familiar indictment, her ready association of modernism and fascism,
recurs often today, as critics attempt to assess the politics of texts
written between the Wars. She falls into the common error of historical
"foreshadowing," as it is astutely described by Michael Andr&eacute;
Bernstein in his essay "Foregone Conclusions: Narrating the Fate of
Austro-German Jewry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Foreshadowed history collapses the vast
array of possibilities, the range of plausible alternative directions
that might follow from any particular moment in time, and gives us
instead a history inflected in its every detail by our own privileged
knowledge of what did in fact happen after that particular moment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The event "that actually happened . . . exists from then on with
all the weight afforded by the singularity of what we might call its
event-ness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 The ethics of this teleologically driven
historiography are frighteningly simple: "the shared knowledge of the
outcome of a series of events by narrator and listener is used to judge
the participants in those events as though they too should have known
what was to come."
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the most fundamental level, Stein's "Introduction" forces us to
confront the enormous difficulties of thinking about modernism in the
shadow of the Shoah. "The more devastating the event," Bernstein points
out, "the greater the compensatory pressure to comprehend it according
to the strictest teleological model as the climax of a grim trajectory
whose inevitable outcome it must be."
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 But, he continues, in
a sentence that fits well with Stein's overturning of narrative logics,
"no historical event, no paradigm of struggle, resistance, and loss,
can transform the death of countless human beings into a tragedy, if
only because real events never happen as part of an already narrated
form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 Understanding any of modernism's texts in political
terms paradoxically requires both that we practice a laborious remembering
of the contexts and motivations, the other writings and events that
surrounded those texts, but also that we simultaneously cultivate a form
of forgetting, a suspension of our certain knowledge of what did, in fact,
transpire in the unknowable future of which that text would become a part.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's lessons in forgetting, rather than being equivalent to the
Nazi's institutionalized and obsessively narrativized acts of erasure and
forgetting that enabled the extermination of millions of people, present
us instead with a model for overturning the complaisant simplicities
of histories that forget "that events now far in the past were once in
the future."

The "Introduction" is hardly a simple paean to P&eacute;tain. He rises
in Stein's third paragraph as an inert, symbolic re--a statue, an
emblem of the collective imagination of the French in wartime. He has
no more substance than any of the res milling about on the stage of
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He is very like George Washington because he too is first in war first
in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen, who like George
Washington has given them courage

 in their darkest moments held
them together through their times of desperation and has always told
them the truth and in telling them the truth has made them realise that
the truth would set them free. ("MP,"  93)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Built piece by piece in a collage of clich&eacute;s, this leader satisfies
a public need and, in so doing, the actual old man vanishes just as
certainly as George Washington did in his becoming the Father of our
Country: P&eacute;tain "became not P&eacute;tain not Mar&eacute;chal
P&eacute;tain but the Mar&eacute;chal" ("MP," 94). Temporal continuity
and causality are no more pertinent to this story than they were to
Angel Harper's or Joseph Lane's: "In the last war . . . was when we first
knew about P&eacute;tain, and Verdun did not fall. Then for a long time
there was nothing about him" ("MP," 94). When he reappears in this next
War, he comes essentially without attachments: "the French people they
realised that being as old as he was and not having a family, he had no
future, he only had the future of France" ("MP," 94). As we read Stein's
bizarre anatomy of this man who has lost his name, we understand that it
is precisely because he has been made from a person into a leader that he
has so little substance, is so old, so often silent, so stripped of past
and future. Angel Harper did a great deal that could not be explained. The
Mar&eacute;chal also defies explanation, though he does virtually nothing:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And then gradually the Mar&eacute;chal either did what any one and every
one thought he ought to do or he did not, and whether he did or whether
he did not and really nobody really knew there was one thing that was
certain and that was that he never defended himself, he never explained
himself, in short his character did not need any defence. ("MP," 95)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The quiet comedy latent in the word "character" surfaces as we realize
that the word refers not to the richly delineated essence of a man named
Philippe Henri P&eacute;tain but to the one-dimensional cutout that is
the Mar&eacute;chal. He is a character indeed, and in this "Introduction"
he flimsily assumes his place beside the other wartime res summoned
in <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The res around whom the emotional energies of Stein's prose
coalescse in this "Introduction" are the uncertain "we" who wait, as
Mrs. Reynolds waits, wondering what might happen next and how they
might respond. "Always there were rumors and more rumors," Stein writes
wearily; "we used to stand on the country-roads and discuss" the contest
between the Germans and the Mar&eacute;chal ("MP," 95). "We all talked
and talked," she reports to us, and it becomes clear by the end of this
"Introduction" that these "we" measure time in this war by the spinning
of stories and the gradual shifting of opinions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Time saturates this "Introduction" as it does <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>, and
for many of the same reasons. In the absence of any empowering sense
of "somebody doing anything and anything happening," the disoriented
people standing on the country roads can only trade stories back and
forth--stories whose very telling bears witness to the unavoidable,
overwhelming fact of waiting in ignorance as time passes. Stein sketches

<B></B>

the genesis of one such story about the Mar&eacute;chal, being
careful to present the narrative so that we understand that we are not to
inquire into whether it actually happened: "Gradually they began to tell
that when he was asked who was going to win the English or the Germans,
he did not answer and when he was pressed he touched his breast and
answered Moi I" ("MP," 95). But what does the first-person pronoun mean
when attached to the Mar&eacute;chal in this shadowy narrative (who asked
this question? when? where?)? Earlier in her brief "Introduction," Stein
has already slipped the French subject from its moorings in identity:
"As a Frenchman explained it to me it is not only that they do not think
alike with their neighbors but they do not think alike within themselves"
("MP," 94).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We have discovered these scattered selves everywhere in
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>. Memory may be able to hoodwink us into the
comforting belief after the fact that we have held one opinion (or an
orderly progression of opinions) through our trials, but Stein knows
better, and she has tried to teach her readers so.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prophecy, that other hermeneutic for tidying up the passage of
time, is likewise qualified in this "Introduction," as it was in
<I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>. The Mar&eacute;chal seems to fulfill "the old
prediction" of France's savior being "an old man on a white horse." But
Stein's utterance of the prophecy begins with the defensive phrase "to
be sure" and concludes with another assurance that rings as much of the
need to buttress credibility as it does of certainty: "as a matter of fact
he did make the armistice in front of Lyon" ("MP," 94). If it was making
an armistice with the occupying army that the "old prediction" intended
as salvation, this prophecy is fraught with the deepest ironies in its
coming to fruition. Like any number of moments in <I>Mrs. Reynolds</I>,
this sentence bears poignant witness to its author's desire for an
orderly scheme, a story to tell as "week by week things were getting
more and more terrible" ("MP," 94). The miracle of the Mar&eacute;chal's
presence is that, simply by being a focal point around which the "we"
might circulate, passing the time in talk, he collects pieces desultorily
into an unstable whole: "And so we in France . . . having seen every
time that all being lost actually everything was being held together"
("MP," 95). The passive voice speaks perfectly to how little agency is
required of the Mar&eacute;chal. It is fitting that the occasion for this
"Introduction" should be a collection of speeches. Stein demonstrates in
her paragraph comparing George Washington and P&eacute;tain how quickly
rhetoric collects round a public re and how the "I" behind that
re vanishes in a windy fanfare of clich&eacute;.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is, further, a specific reason that Stein has for wanting to present
these translated speeches to the American people, and it strikes me as
ironic that Stein's own, explicit historical positioning of her essay
receives no notice from Van Dusen, whose attention is drawn instead to
various positions she wishes Stein had taken. "I am well aware that until
just now," Stein begins the second paragraph of her "Introduction," "it
would have been quite impossible to interest my fellow countrymen in these
words which tell so convincing and moving a story" ("MP," 91). Her next
sentence repeats the locating phrase, "just now." And the third sentence
in this

<B></B>

sequence of temporal coordinates lets us know precisely
that the occasion for Stein's writing this "Introduction"--perhaps its
very day of drafting--is 7 December 1941: "Since the civil war until
to-day, when the action of Japan has made us realize the misery the
grief and the terror of war . . . we did not understand defeat enough to
sympathise with the French people" ("MP," 93). Pearl Harbor has made it
possible for Americans to comprehend the need for a Mar&eacute;chal or
a Washington. The "convincing" and "moving" story this "Introduction"
promises is not so much the speeches themselves; it is the story Stein
tells of a people's need for speeches, though the giver of those speeches
is scarcely visible as anything other than a projection of a wounded
and confused populace. This longing for speeches is a dangerous though
utterly understandable need, and much of what Stein writes over the
course of her long life shows us how and why we should look askance
at anyone who claims that the truth will set us free. Stein's writings
on the Second World War remain disturbing not primarily because of the
political stances one might extract from her supple and elusive prose,
but because they demonstrate the vast distances between the mind in its
unsteady motions and the public, political positions individuals take in
times of calamity. We conduct ourselves, in wartime, under assumed names,
bearing allegiances to abstractions and res on horseback, forcing
the human mind into daily, dishonest compromises. Retribution for these
compromises will come in the as-yet-unwritten histories that gradually
pare lives down until each fits neatly into the contours of a narrative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the first part of this essay, I discussed the challenges Stein
presents to contemporary scholarship, bent as it is on locating texts in
history and on reading for signs of the author's identity, her sexual
and sociopolitical orientations, her psychological predispositions. In
crucial respects, Stein is philosophically and, as we have just seen,
methodologically at odds with an academy and a larger intellectual culture
that currently desire her recuperation as one of the most important
authors of our century. She is being remembered, in a wide variety of
venues, as someone whose life and work is of enormous consequence. But
the terms of that remembrance are powerfully inflected by hermeneutics
that privilege historicity, by interpretive approaches that work from the
author's psyche (and, particularly in the case of Stein, her sexuality)
to the text. These critical valuations, crucially different from those
Stein herself promoted and practiced, make it difficult for us to discern
accurately or fully the nature of Stein's work. If we are to "locate"
Stein in history, we should keep uppermost in our minds her adamant and
repeated assertions concerning the emptiness of historical categories
of understanding. If we are to assess her manuscripts--and I think it
important that we do so--we should not simply read them for clues or
details from the life. Stein would have those few <I>carnets</I> that
were neither lost nor destroyed travel a route from Alice's hands toward
forgetting. The trajectory would only be forlorn, the attending losses
lamentable to those still snared by human nature's longing for narratives
of intimacy, for stories built around recollection. If we learn to read
with our minds, as moderns who have overcome the tyrannical claims of
memory, everything in the <I>carnets</I> will look more or less the
same, as a landscape appears from

<B></B>

an airplane.
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 There
will be no stories then to tell, in this steady-state verbal system,
since we will know how to distribute our attention equally among all
words. What is made will look like what is found. The products of human
labor will be indistinguishable from natural phenomena. Differences
at the level of drafts, if we can even discover them, will scarcely be
worth notice or commentary, just as historical facts will matter less
than states of mind. Textual study, like the writing of history and the
telling of news or the recounting of biographies, will take its properly
subordinate place among other sensual musics. Time will still shape the
songs of dying generations, but it will concern us chiefly, however, as
it measures nothing more--but nothing less--than the regular occurrence
of syllables and silences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this quiet place, however, we will always search for signs of the
author and her stories, even after we have been urged to do otherwise. The
penultimate paragraph of "Natural Phenomena" exposes the question that
motivates our search:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What does it mean when all of it has been put there and does not show
that it has been put there has been put there has been put there too
does not any of it show that it has been put there and it has been put
there too has been put there too. ("NP," 233)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To offer any reading of this sentence is to ascribe a particular intent
to communicate to its author and thereby to do a kind of violence to its
deliberate open-endedness, since the question it frames is precisely what
kinds of meaning we can justifiably attach to something if its existence
offers little evidence of agency, no testimony of creative intent, no
sign of having been "put" at all. Can we read it if it is a phenomenon
of nature rather than a product of humankind? Do natural phenomena have
meaning at all, or does that meaning follow only after we have painted
the phenomena in colors provided by the imagination? Interpretation is
the name for the activity by means of which we assure ourselves that
"all of it has been put there." It is the name for our fond hope that
we can leave marks on the world that others will take the trouble
to decipher; that love letters will find recipients and encourage
answers; that at least some of the phenomena we encounter derive from
human consciousnesses rather than the blindly powerful forces that
make hurricanes and earthquakes, tidal waves and the <I>aurora</I>
<I>borealis</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></SUP>
 To interpret is to declare ourselves more
or less at home.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Among the modernists of her generation, Stein is the most ruthless
in her examination of the assumptions that underwrite the related
acts of interpretation and positioning oneself in time. She is the
most skeptical in her scrutiny of the subject's place in the world,
the least inclined to foreclose questions, the most avid to query the
suppositions that allow us to read and write. She builds up the last
paragraph of "Natural Phenomena" as though she can count on nothing,
can take nothing for granted: "After a little while it has been by that
time by that time when by that time and when by that time and when by
that time and choice. I choose you. I choose you too" ("NP," 233). We
know of time's passing partly by the accrual of phrases. The paragraph
contains its own clock for measuring: "by that time" gradually adds
up.

<B></B>

When "that time" has arrived--and we have been prepared by
the opening phrase of the first sentence to know that the moment we await
will come "after a little while"--we discover the noun ("choice") that
names the exercise of will that sets human actions apart from natural
phenomena. And following the nomination of this crucial human enterprise
come two brief sentences built around that noun: "I choose you. I choose
you too." We have already heard Dydo's confident assurance that these
sentences are "undoubtedly an exchange between Stein and Toklas." But
the end of "Natural Phenomena" will not be fit tidily into a domestic
scene. These sentences generate more questions than answers. Is this a
reassuring fragment of a conversation, a sign that we have come happily
home to a place of mutual choosing after struggling through a long and
challenging piece of writing? Or does the "I" designate the same person in
both sentences, which might give to this ending an unsettling, open-ended
twist. These two sentences could be the beginning of a list of choices
by a single, polygamous "I" rather than a tiny story about reciprocated
desire. The corollary question is whether the object of each sentence
stands for the same person (or whether it represents a person at all). We
might also wonder whether the "you" knows it has been chosen. When we
come upon these sentences in the virtual vacuum of this paragraph, we
should spend a good deal of our interpretive energy considering our own
strategies for making narratives from pronouns and verbs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein gives us very little to take with us, little to remember as we work
through the enormous accumulation of her writing. Drafts don't necessarily
evolve. Characters don't add up to wholes by a novel's end. Events only
sometimes seem to cause or to follow one another. History, insofar as
we can discern it as an object of inquiry, happens somewhere else,
to subjects other than ourselves. Narrative is a trickle that runs
intermittently through Stein's prose; rarely does it make a stream. We
are forced to carry what we know with us as we proceed and to recognize
how small the bundle is that holds our knowledge: "after a little while
it has been by that time." In Stein's parsimonious imagining of the
subject, there is almost nothing about states of mind that can count
itself historical.

I am thinking of the general trend toward materially inflected

Stein as a politically engaged writer: "She lacked a global imagination,
and it was this provinciality that laid her vulnerable to charges of

her emotion was reserved for those whose immediate existence possessed

In a Nietzschean paragraph following this passage, Stein has the
historian, in a necessary act of bad faith, embracing ignorance of the

Bridgman writes that "In 'Natural Phenomena' she took up the argument

For an illustration of this phenomenon, see the <I>carnet</I> in
folder 1720, in which Stein is writing "Phenomena of Nature" up to the

From the eight <I>carnets</I> and the twenty-eight sections contained
in those <I>carnets</I>, there are six instances of sections used
sequentially in the final text. These six instances involve a total
of thirteen sections. Five are cases where Stein uses two sections
contiguously; the sixth consists of a string of three sections. For an
example of the scattered distribution of <I>carnet</I> sections, see page
191 of the published "Phenomena of Nature": the contiguous paragraphs
beginning "What is the difference" and "Only only very nearly" and "He
knew how to look at a lake" follow each other in <I>carnet</I> 1721,
though the first is separated from the second two paragraphs in that
<I>carnet</I> by miscellaneous other writing. But the next paragraph
(beginning "if they tap and do so too") comes from <I>carnet</I> 1735.

See, for example, <I>carnet</I> 1721, where the phrase "what is the

"P. of N." In this same <I>carnet</I> we find "I was watching" is a
phrase that Stein deletes from a section headed "A third" but then uses
in "P. of N.": "Phenomena of Nature all around I was watching." See also
1733, where "A third" ends with musings on the number "thirty-three" and
"P. of N." begins with "Thirty three and numerous makes mountains."

It is worth comparing Stein's collation of Washington and
