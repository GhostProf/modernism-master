Ever since Woolf's recuperation by feminists in the 1970s, critics have attempted to overcome the powerful stereotype of her as a fragile genius, unconnected with the world. This view, so dominant in <i>Recollections of VirginiaWoolf by Her Contemporaries</i>, and more recently in the book and movie <i>The Hours</i>, has been difficult to dislodge. Fortunately, these three books confirm Woolf's deep engagement in the social and political world of her times. Black and Cuddy-Keane concentrate on Woolf as a professional writer, as someone who had to meet deadlines, work with editors, and persuade readers. Cuddy-Keane examines how Woolf responded to specific political events, while Black integrates Woolf's lifelong feminism with her anti-war arguments. Humm concentrates on Woolf and her sister, Vanessa Bell, as amateur photographers, showing how their fascination with contemporary visual technologies affected their work. All three would agree that this quintessential modernist appeals to a post-modern sensibility in her insistent creation of multiple layers and points of view. Like Woolf, all are very aware of their own critical biases.
</p>

<p>
These authors acknowledge a characteristic that either endears or annoys readers: Woolf's repeated use of ironic fantasy, or what Black 

<b></b>

calls her "dense, whimsical, and semi-academic style" . Each effectively defends Woolf's idiosyncratic style for its effective balancing of different arguments and positions. To paraphrase Woolf, they see her as one of the few English writers writing for grown-up people. Black notes how Woolf insisted that readers undertake an imaginative engagement with her argument by the use of provocative asides, digressions from the subject at hand, and a discordant combination of anger and humor. Cuddy-Keane concludes that Woolf's elliptical style encouraged her readers to think for themselves. Humm compliments Woolf's sophisticated use of "photographic tropes of illumination and reflection" , which draw attention to the elusive, evanescent nature of reality. These critics each provide such good close readings of Woolf's essays that I wish they had considered more fully the stylistic relationship between her nonfiction and fiction. Woolf's unique critical voice combines fact and fiction in psychologically and politically unsettling ways that are well worth exploring. 
</p>

<p>
There is surprisingly little overlap in these three studies. Woolf was so prolific that each author emphasizes different works. The most broadly based book is Cuddy-Keane's careful dissection of Woolf as a public intellectual. Her opening chapter on the interwar debate about education, mass culture and politics is especially strong. She documents Woolf's carefully argued position on the value of independent learning, of an individual's thoughtful engagement with books, ideas and ideologies. Cuddy-Keane labels Woolf a "democratic highbrow," which seems to me a perfect description of Woolf's mixture of elitism and social responsibility. Woolf had no illusions that everyone could be a sophisticated reader, but she always believed this to be a politically important goal for modern British citizens. Moreover, she especially wanted women of all social classes to benefit from a proper education. Woolf vehemently opposed any curriculum that was a watered-down version of middle-class culture; for her it was a repugnant perpetuation of second-hand ideas. A later chapter explores why Woolf always loathed honors, awards and hierarchies, whether for persons or for books. She opposed, for example, F. R. Leavis's creation of a canon of English literature, but she urged her readers toward specific English masterpieces. Especially during the 1930s, when literary commentators on all sides used a hard-edged political style, Woolf's personal, distinctively feminist voice seemed outdated. Her multilayered argument, with its ironic twists and turns, now seems far more supple and intelligent than most of the self-righteous criticism of the interwar years. Cuddy-Keane's book should be required reading for anyone interested in the intellectual and cultural history of modernism.
</p>

<p>
Cuddy-Keane analyzes Woolf's writing style, while Black explicates the often-difficult content of her essays. Both critics, for example, discuss Woolf's 1920 polemical essay, "The Plumage Bill." Cuddy-Keane situates it in terms of audience and purpose, noting that Massingham's sexist attack on "child-bearing" women who wore feathers appeared in <i>The Nation</i>, a left-leaning weekly, whereas Woolf's reply appeared in the <i>Women's Leader</i>, whose readers were largely female and feminist. She concentrates on the various twists or "wobbles" Woolf takes to convince her readers that the real enemies of endangered egrets are not women, but rather male hunters and sellers of feathers. For Cuddy-Keane, Woolf's ironies "indict men for violence and, at the same time, problematize this indictment" . Throughout her book, Cuddy-Keane notes the power of Woolf's conversational style as an effective strategy for chastising her adversaries without turning them into enemies. Although she admits that readers did not always understand Woolf's subtle arguments, she does not fault her for political failure. Black, a political scientist, is more concerned with results than with rhetorical strategies. Since Massingham dismissed Woolf as sectarian, Black concludes, "Irony, comedy, and exaggeration have, as they will so often in the future, both leavened her prose and confused, then angered a 'progressive' audience" . Cuddy-Keane is always stimulating and thoughtful, but I wish she had been more willing to discuss the limitations of Woolf's methods. Moreover, it is surprising that she does not include <i>Three Guineas</i> in her purview. Fortunately, Black's thorough study compensates for this lack, but I longed for Cuddy-Keane's subtle textual analysis of this complex book.
</p>

<p>
Black, an editor of the Shakespeare Head edition of <i>Three Guineas</i>, examines Woolf's feminism through the lens of this late book. While an earlier generation of feminist critics saw Woolf as a great foremother, Black places her back in her own times. She carefully enumerates Woolf's various political commitments, showing how often she was called upon to give a lecture, attend 

<b></b>

a meeting, sign a petition, or donate money. And Woolf did so, repeatedly. Through friends and relatives, she was in contact with all the major suffrage organizations, including the working-class Women's Cooperative Guild. In the 1920s and 1930s, Woolf supported the post-suffrage London and National Society for Women's Service, which lobbied Parliament on women's issues. She also supported the Women's Employment Federation, which worked to widen women's job opportunities. Given her deep commitment to women's self-education, Woolf was a loyal benefactor of the Fawcett Library; from March 1938 until her death, she agreed to pay for the books they ordered and she donated many of the books footnoted in <i>Three Guineas</i> . 
</p>

<p>
Black's major focus, however, is on Woolf's feminist theory, which she sees as a coherent attack on all forms of patriarchy. Black reminds us of how radical her ideas were (and are). For example, Woolf hoped for "economic independence and privacy . . . as well as for egalitarian, nonviolent families" . Politicians have never seriously considered her call for a "living wage" for wives. Woolf also wanted women to have an education as good as men's, including the freedom to travel and live independently. During the interwar years, women faced many barriers to economic self-sufficiency; upon marriage, many women legally lost their jobs. Rather than condemning Woolf for her utopian solutions to social problems, Black suggests the importance of Woolf's stand against all patriarchal institutions. For her, Woolf'sfeminism is deeply radical, asking for profound changes in society, rather than simply calling for equal opportunities with men or for valuing women's unique contributions. <i>Three Guineas</i> is not so much a feminist manifesto against war as it is a "transformative argument"  showing "that the educational and professional structures of public life, which exclude women, are intrinsically hierarchical, and therefore the basic causes of war" . 
</p>

<p>
Black focuses entirely on explicating <i>Three Guineas</i>, clarifying its complex argument and style. Her book has a somewhat old-fashioned feel; it is accessible, clear and modest in its aims. More speculation about Woolf's general methods, as well as a consideration of the poor responses to this carefully constructed book, would have strengthened her analyses. For example, Black reminds readers of the frequent deletion of the five photographs of men in public rituals from various editions of <i>Three Guineas</i>, but her conclusion is predictable. For Black, the photographs of a general, a judge, an archbishop, an academic procession, and a row of buglers all in full regalia, underscore "the absence of women from the formal ceremonial contexts that attest to public power" . She notes the very negative reception of these photographs among Woolf's male friends, but does not extend her interpretation beyond this point. Why were these photographs so frequently deleted from later editions of <i>Three Guineas</i>? Were they too inflammatory or too distracting? In this richly detailed study, Black could tell us more about the ways in which feminism was forced to the margins of political debate by the late 1930s even among sympathetic men.
</p>

<p>
In sharp contrast, Humm's analysis of <i>Three Guineas</i> spends little time on either the political context or the five photographs. Instead, she discusses Woolf's descriptions of absent photographs of dead mothers and children during the Spanish Civil War. Her exploration of the "dense visual plenitude" of <i>Three Guineas</i> offers fascinating and provocative new insights into this allusive work. Humm considers Woolf's descriptions of photographs of dead women and children emblematic of "experiences unacknowledged by patriarchy," a point with which Black would agree. She stretches her argument further, however, to suggest that the female narrator's memories of these photographs and her revulsion against them are corporeal signs of gender difference. Readers may balk at her Lacanian reading, which insists upon an essentialized notion of a "specifically female modernist memory," based on "corporeal affect" . She comes perilously close to reducing the absent photographs to "female modernist memory" and the published photographs of powerful men to symbols. Her focus on how "photographs and visual memories can reveal a gendered subjectivity"  gives her argument clarity and energy, yet surely at the loss of political force. Faced with an imminent war that placed her husband in grave danger, Woolf may not have seen patriarchal leaders as simply "fetishes of the symbolic," but rather as very real and present dangers to women and Jews. The photographs were neither jokes nor symbols, as her peers knew. As Black so convincingly argues, Woolf's aim in <i>Three Guineas</i> went beyond the creation of a gendered subjectivity; she intended to call into question patriarchy itself. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Humm's book is most valuable in its detailed discussions of Vanessa and Virginia Stephen's early and long-lasting fascination with photography. Here her argument that photographs are carriers of gendered memories is original and persuasive. Humm portrays an artist and a writer who quickly and easily incorporated into their work the visual possibilities of both photography and film. In the surviving photograph albums, Woolf did not arrange her photographs in any artistic or chronological order, nor did she winnow them, throwing away out-of-focus or poorly framed photographs. For Humm, these casual, intimate snapshots are a rich source for documenting the domestic as an integral part of the modernist movement. Humm contends that when Woolf repeatedly places the same sitters in similar poses, it suggests an unconscious return to an earlier "visual event." For her, this is an 1892 family photograph of her parents reading on a sofa, with the young Virginia in the background. It is pasted into one of Woolf's albums, out of chronological order, but close to a single, formal portrait of her mother. Humm argues that the family photograph is in dialogue with the many other informal photographs of Woolf's friends and living family members. Her psychoanalytic approach works well here, illuminating the complex ways in which both Bell and Woolf reconstituted the maternal in their art and fiction. 
</p>

<p>
For many readers the most interesting part of Humm's book will be her tactful dissection of Vanessa Bell's photographs of her children. Humm is consistently respectful and sensible, avoiding both impossible claims for Bell's motivations and twenty-first century judgments. Bell's family albums contain approximately fifty photographs of naked children and ten of naked children with fully clothed adults. They were highly unusual at the time, and Humm sees them as examples of Bell's "fresh and powerful engagement" with feminine modernity . Humm reads the photographs for their eroticism and artistry, as well as the reciprocal, active participation of the subjects. Julian, the eldest son, for example, repeatedly looks directly at the camera. Humm notes how some of the photographs echo those that Bell's aunt, Julia Margaret Cameron, took in the 1860s. Bell contextualized the nude photographs in unexpected ways; album pages include different shots taken at different times, so that, unlike Woolf, she created a sequence and narrative with her photographs. Bell constantly placed a nude portrait with photographs of herself posing with the children, or even out-of-focus shots of them playing and posing. For Humm, these juxtapositions situate the erotic in a more conventional context that finds pleasure in visual repetition. She concludes that these photographs show Bell making "her art part of a natural, everyday, non-hierarchical world" . As someone who has never cared for Bell's art, I found Humm's discussion valuable for raising larger issues about the tensions between the formal, expressive goals of visual art and Bell's effort to include everyday moments in that art. Humm is less successful in her quick rundown of feminist writers on early silent films, but I valued her insistence on taking seriously the different ways in which women artists and writers incorporated new visual materials into their work. 
</p>

<p>
Humm is the most invested in current theoretical trends, and offers the most imaginative reconstruction of Woolf as an author; other critics will mine her insights, developing further the connections between photography and modernist writing. Black sticks closely to her texts, but the result is a definitive study of <i>Three Guineas</i>. Her book will be required reading for anyone interested in feminist political theory. If Humm is perhaps too trendy, Black at times seems too literal in her interpretations of an author who reveled in metaphor and fantasy. Cuddy-Keane draws from a variety of critical sources, including not only Foucault, but also Bakhtin, Bourdieu, and Pratt. Her flexible approach to Woolf's nonfiction yields fresh insights that illuminate Woolf's major fiction. Each author demonstrates how important Woolf's thinking continues to be in the twenty-first century. 
</p>

<p>
In early 1933, the feminist composer Ethel Smyth tried to sum up the personality of Virginia Woolf: "She is arrogant intellectually beyond words&#x02014;yet absolutely humble about her own great gift. Her integrity chiefly fascinates me, I think. To save your life, or her own, she could not doctor what she thinks to be the truth. . . . How far V. is human I don't know. She is very moody&#x02014;incalculable&#x02014;&amp; has never been known to admit that she can be in the wrong. And yet you love her&#x02014;love her."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Each of these three authors tackles Woolf's profound intellectual and personal integrity, showing her consistent engagement with the major issues of her day. I hope they will also lay to rest the false notion that Woolf refused to engage in the political issues of her 

<b></b>

day. Best of all, reading these books has reminded me of why so many people love reading Woolf and reading about Woolf; indeed, why her work is continually worthy of reinterpretation for each new generation of students and scholars.
