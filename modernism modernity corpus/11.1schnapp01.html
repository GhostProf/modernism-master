Archaeologies of the Modern
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
"Archaeologies of the Modern" invites a double explanation: first,
of a title that associates the modern(ist) scene with the excavation
of apparently fragmentary pasts; second, of the issue's unconventional
format. The issue is dialogical in structure and provocative in intent. It
conjoins essays authored by cultural historians and by archaeologists, and
accompanies each contribution by an archaeologist with a brief response
from a cultural historian, and vice versa. The aim of this device, as
well as of the special issue as a whole, is to inaugurate a dialogue
between reflections on archaeology as a modern discipline and inquiries
into the archaeological imagination in nineteenth- and twentieth-century
cultural forms. We believe that this dialogue transgresses the limits
of conventional interdisciplinarity because it excavates forms in the
cultural imaginary that find a home in no orthodox disciplinary field.
<p>
One simple and limited aim of the issue is to contribute to the new
history of archaeology. It was only in the 1980s that histories of the
publications of supposed great and originary minds in archaeology
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
were augmented by simple sociological and ideological motivation:
for example, middle-class Anglo-American experience reflected in
archaeological method and theory;
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
nineteenth-century nationalisms fueling archaeological research into
local origins.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Research into the history of archaeology





based upon other than published sources had to wait until the mid-1990s
(notably associated with the AREA Project: see Nathan Schlanger's
contribution to the dossier in this issue).
<p>
Anything other than a strictly internalist account of archaeology may well
be far off, but there is more to archaeology than the discipline. Here
our issue's title points to a much wider aim of furthering what may be
called an archaeological history of modernity and its cultural imaginary,
modernism, through an exploration of their archaeological components.
<p>
To explain what we mean by this we begin with a classic modernist and
archaeological gesture (one of Duchamp's readymades) and then sketch
three archaeological moments of the last century or so. These lay the
ground for a glossary of some key features of archaeological discourse
that are the subject of this issue's papers.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
An Archaeological Gesture
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Consider the snow shovel chosen by Marcel Duchamp as the protagonist
of <i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i> . The shovel poses
fundamental questions about the nature of objects and their relation to
the world. Duchamp's shovel was bought off the shelf of a hardware store,
torn from the everyday and set in a museum gallery with a title. It is a
fragment of the material culture of the early twentieth century, a piece
of machine-age trash&#x02014;quite unexceptional. But in its association
with Duchamp, in its gallery siting, in its titling, it is also a special
shovel. It bears an argument about the character of contemporary art (the
gallery and its objects; the artist's work and choices). It preres
a narrative (contemporary newspapers had carried the story of a man who
had broken his arm clearing the streets of snow). It is also a relic,
an object of worship and even pilgrimage, a fetish&#x02014;preserved (and,
indeed, recreated) for posterity so as to keep alive a distinctly modern
practice of <i>decontextualization</i> and <i>recontextualization</i>.
<p>
The readymade piece of art is, of course, duplicitous. In the gallery
it betrays its function and elicits new significances only through this
betrayal. It is tagged with the story of a <i>future</i> denouement. It
doesn't dig, but breaks arms. Duchamp's <i>In Advance of the Broken
Arm</i> positions itself ahead of the work of digging, of uncovering
and amassing. The shovel is an avant-<i>bras:</i> we might push the
gesture further and say that <i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i> moves
in advance of a <i>double</i> movement that would break the arm of
certain longstanding disciplinary conventions: an antiquarian tradition
in archaeology with its cult of the past as radical continuity; the
anti-antiquarian strain in studies of modernism and modernity with its
celebration of history as radical discontinuity. The shovel is a token
of digging, but only in a manner of speaking. No longer able to seek out
origins in depths, it instead excavates passages (snow removed from city
streets) across the labile, unsteady surfaces of an epoch that places
constant demands upon the recent and remote past while feverishly seeking
innovation; an epoch in which institutions dedicated to the recovery,
preservation, reconstruction, and display of ancient "finds" coexist with
institutions of countermemory dedicated to the cult of ever renewable,
ever new <i>trouvailles</i>. That such <i>trouvailles</i> may include


<b></b>


<i>trouv&#x000E8;res</i> or may choose to privilege ancient
textual/architectural remains (as in the cases of Eliot and Pound)
merely underscores the point.
<p>
Decontextualization and recontextualization&#x02014;how does this duplicity
and irony relate to the practices that long placed archaeology in the
service of historical, national, and international myths of origin
and (dis)continuity: of group identity formation (nationalisms), race
(ethnicity), technological progress, the rise and fall of civilizations,
and the like? And how does this distinctly modern(ist) culture of objects
intersect the history of archaeology itself, as well as more recent
critiques of archaeology, as it were, from the inside? Is the broken arm
that the shovel betokens a future in which archaeology excavates in the
service of discontinuity? These are among the questions that the present
special issue seeks to explore.

Modernist Dreams of An Other Archaeology
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
To speak of a literal archaeology of the modern era might appear perverse
given the negative role assigned to archaeologists and antiquarians in
the most advanced expressions of modern culture. From Gustave Flaubert
to the avant-gardes and beyond, the archaeologist, whether amateur
or professional, has routinely been dismissed as an intransigent and
acritical worshipper of the past, and as an adversary of the new,
the unexpected, and the unknown. Indeed, when Flaubert sends his two
"imbeciles," Bouvard and P&#x000E9;cuchet, into archaeological raptures,
it is only to underscore their unthinking pretension, most tellingly when
they learn of phallic symbolism among the ancient Celts&#x02014;"and for
Bouvard and P&#x000E9;cuchet everything became a phallus. They collected
the swing-bars of carriages, legs of armchairs, cellar bolts, chemists'
pestles."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
In their archaeological excess, the pair recruits even the most
functional objects of material culture into a bathetic ancient symbolics;
their combination of rapt fetishism and autodidactic ignorance cruelly
parodies amateur antiquarianism. The 1909 Founding Manifesto of Futurism,
similarly, launches its incendiary appeal for a worship of the future
against "the fetid cancer of professors, archaeologists, tourist guides,
and antiques dealers."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Boccioni and the Futurist painters take aim at a similar list, denouncing
restorers, critics, and gouty academics, but singling out for special
attention "affected archaeologists with their chronic necrophilia."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Professors, tourist guides, antiques dealers, archaeologists: the
tumor of pass&#x000E9;ism was fed by the nineteenth century's seemingly
insatiable appetite for experiences of the past as present, whether
this meant continuity in the form of relics collected, inserted into
bourgeois interiors, or styles from the past revived and resurrected as
ornamental surfaces laid over machines or modern constructions. Whether
in its houses of secular worship (such as museums and libraries) or in
its amusement parks, the century constantly sought to animate the present
with expressions of a past that was felt to be ever more remote, thanks
to the tumultuous impact of the industrial revolution and the resulting
time-space compression and acceleration. But in its very remoteness that
past became material for reanimation from the dead into living forms,
as well as a realm of pleasurable fantasy and consumption associated
with leisure.


<b></b>


<p>
So when Tristan Tzara first codified the emancipatory nature of Dada's
work of demolition nearly a decade after Marinetti and Boccioni, the
archaeologist remained squarely in the line of fire:

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
DADA; every object, all objects, feelings and obscurities, every
apparition and the precise shock of parallel lines, are means for
the battle of: DADA; the abolition of memory: DADA; the abolition of
archaeology: DADA the abolition of prophets: DADA; the abolition of
the future: DADA; the absolute and indisputable belief in every god
that is an immediate product of spontaneity . . . Liberty: DADA DADA
DADA;&#x02014;the roar of contorted pains, the interweaving of contraries
and all contradictions, freaks and irrelevancies: LIFE.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The avant-gardes' target is twofold: on the one hand, nineteenth-century
amateur archaeology as driven by the culture of connoisseurship
and collecting, associated with the country estate, the bourgeois
interior, and the museum as reliquary; on the other hand, a newly
emerging professional or "scientific" archaeology, driven by field
research and supported by academies and universities. The two are
collapsed into a single monolithic antiquarianism whose deeper logic
is declared insidious because it locates the past at the very core of
a conservative, continuity-based vision of the future. The diagnosis is
largely correct. Much as in the science fictions of Jules Verne, Edward
Bulwer-Lytton, and H. G. Wells, amateur and professional antiquarians
were committed to a futurology that either elevated objects outside of
time and space into a realm of transcultural and transhistorical beauty
(the cult of the masterpiece) and/or subordinated them within grand
evolutionary schemes and narratives in the service of a higher law
(progress, science, nationhood, humanity, God). Hence Tzara's leap
from archaeology- and memory-bashing to the bashing of prophets and
futurologists. And hence the importance granted to accidents, freaks,
and exceptions to any and every rule.
<p>
As is made explicit in Tzara's text, the abolition of archaeology
has nested within it a positive counterproposal. It stands as the
precondition for an other (and even <i>othering</i>) archaeology loosely
affiliated both with Freud's tracking of subterranean psychic and somatic
intensities, and with an ongoing modern preoccupation, extending from
Nietzsche through Artaud and Bataille, with tapping into "prehistoric"
instinctualisms, violence, savagery, sacrifice, and sacrality. Instead of
feeding necrophilia, this modernist archaeology purports to operate in the
service of life. It unburies life forms resistant to or hostile to Culture
and Civilization. Irreducible and intractable, its "finds" refuse to be
absorbed into grand narratives of nation-building, science, or progress
and yield surprises, shocks, thrills, and traumas. They belong either
to the realm of prehistory or to the material culture of the everyday.
<p>
This other archaeology purports to free objects from the onus of having
to signify, to function, to be accessible or available. It cherishes the
duplicity of archaeological objects: their moments of decontextualization
and recontextualization. In being dug out and ripped from its matrix,
the old object holds the potential of producing the effect of the new,
by virtue of its very remoteness and alterity, its singularity. The
process, the duplicity, is one of estrangement, re-collection, recovery.

Three Modern Archaeological Moments
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
1. April or May 1896: An Archaeology of the Psyche
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
In a letter to Stefan Zweig in 1931, Sigmund Freud complains, or brags,
"I have sacrificed a great deal for my collection of Greek, Roman and
Egyptian antiquities, [and] have actually read more archaeology than
psychology."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The obsessive nature of Freud's antiquity collecting is well
documented. In Edmund Engelman's famous photographs of the study at
Berggasse 19, glowering masks dangle precariously over archaic gods
huddled cheek by jowl on every available surface.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
H. D. describes her first reaction to the doctor's examining room as
speechless amazement before the wealth of collectibles: "Sigmund Freud
does not speak. He is waiting for me to say something. I cannot speak. I
look around the room. . . . Pricelessly lovely objects are displayed
here on the shelves to right, to left of me. . . . no one had told me
that this room was lined with treasures."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Freud's personal physician relates that Freud called his collecting
"an addiction second in intensity only to his nicotine addiction."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
But Freud's interest in archaeological artifacts is not manifest
simply in a mania for rines. Although his confession to Zweig may
well be exaggerated, his lifelong fascination with archaeology was
systematic enough to call for a library of archaeological treatises
running to hundreds of titles and to undergird a close friendship
with Emanuel L&#x000F6;wy, recently rediscovered as a "forgotten pioneer"
in archaeological research.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
Underlying this scientific curiosity is a personal enthrallment to the
re of Heinrich Schliemann: as early as 1899, Freud writes Wilhelm
Fliess of his envy for the discoverer of Troy, whose archaeological
motivations he ascribes to childhood dreams as vivid as his own early
love for Rome: "happiness comes only with the fulfillment of a childhood
wish. This reminds me that I shall not go to Italy this year."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
Even before this avowal of personal idolatry, Freud had introduced
archaeology as a methodological correlate to his developing theories of
therapeutic psychology. "The Aetiology of Hysteria" (<i>Zur &#x000C4;tiologie
der Hysterie</i>), first presented as a lecture to the Viennese "Verein
f&#x000FC;r Psychiatrie und Neurologie" in April or May 1896,
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
opens with a justification for Freud and Breuer's approach based
on comparison to excavation&#x02014;an "advance" in archaeological
technique. Freud turns from the patient's autobiographical
self-assessment to the analyst's clinical discovery by invoking
the switch in authority from history to material culture that Gavin
Lucas limns in this issue. An explorer happening upon some ruins may,
Freud suggests, simply ask the locals ("perhaps semi-barbaric people")
to divulge any indigenous traditions concerning their history. "But
he may act differently. . . . he may start upon the ruins, clear
away the rubbish, and, beginning from the visible remains, uncover
what is buried." If he is successful, the unearthed artifacts will
"yield undreamed-of information about the events of the remote
past. . . . <i>Saxa loquuntur!</i>"
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
For one archaeological tradition, stones speak about their history. For
the excavatory analyst, hysterical symptoms are eloquent about their
traumatic causes.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Both authorities, we might add, will exhibit a similar tendency towards
collection and display of the curiosities they expose.


<b></b>


<p>
As with so many things Freudian, the systematic role of archaeology
in Freud's work has been the subject of controversy in the past twenty
years. While Peter Gay is willing to term it "a master metaphor for his
life's work,"
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Donald Spence finds its implied positivism inadequate to the "anecdotal
rather than archival" nature of the "so-called data" of psychoanalysis,
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
to which Donald Kuspit responds that, on the contrary, psychoanalysis
achieves its hermeneutic goals even more successfully than archaeology.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Freud's use of the metaphor is inscribed in a synthetic discussion of
the relation of archaeological practice to modernist thought by Julian
Thomas in his essay in this issue.
<p>
The complexity of critical reaction may simply reflect Freud's own
equivocations: the archaeological metaphor appears at odd intervals
throughout his writing&#x02014;in case studies: Dora, the Wolfman,
the Rat Man; in the analysis of Wilhelm Jensen's archaeological fable
<i>Gradiva</i>&#x02014;subject in each case to varying qualifications
and stipulations.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
In its final evocation, in a late paper on technique, "Constructions
in Analysis" (<i>Konstruktionen in der Analyse</i> [1937]), the exact
equivalence of archaeology and psychoanalysis&#x02014;"the two processes
are in fact identical"&#x02014;is almost immediately negated by the
caveat that "the analyst works under better conditions . . . since
what he is dealing with is not something destroyed but something that
is still alive."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
The distinction here echoes the avant-garde critique of archaeological
pass&#x000E9;ism.
<p>
The complexity of the comparison between archaeology and psychoanalysis is
not lost on Freud. He finds a means of redeploying facets of archaeology
for the modern aspirations of a science of the psyche. The analogy
recruits not just the depth model of excavation, but other aspects
of archaeological practice: its stratigraphic mapping of temporality
onto spatial relations; its conscription of fragmentary evidence into a
causal narrative. Freud compares the layers of the psyche to those of
an archaeological dig, "and if an object makes its appearance in some
particular level, it often remains to be decided whether it belongs to
that level or whether it was carried down to that level owing to some
subsequent disturbance."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
And the broken objects found in this stratigraphic psyche, like the
"priceless though mutilated relics of antiquity" to which he compares
them,
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
must be reassembled to produce their meaning. It is
this&#x02014;crucially&#x02014;that distinguishes the archaeology of
the psyche. The biographical event is redescribed as a psychic
object whose causes and effects can be reconstructed only ex post
facto by the patient analyst, who dusts them off and interprets them
in relation to the other shards buried in the ruins of the psychic
landscape. Like Freud's rines, like his speaking stones, the psychic
object&#x02014;defamiliarized but uncannily at home&#x02014;most strikingly
links psychoanalysis and archaeology: disciplines concerned with objects
recognizable enough to inspire the reconstruction of their narrative,
but remote enough to be accessible only through the ministrations of
an expert.

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
2. July 1926: "Archaeologisms"
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
Th&#x000E9;ophile Homelle, the director of the dig at Delphi, announced
as early as 1895, "Primitive forms of art now take pride of place in
archaeological research," and gushed that archaic sculpture "has the
beauty of a half-opened flower, keeping still hidden and intact its
glory and its perfume."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
But it was not a premonitory whiff of the aesthetics


<b></b>


of classical Greece that modern art found most salutary in archaic
archaeology. If the primitivism of the early years of the century relies
on the trappings of cultures far-flung in space&#x02014;African masks and
Tahitian maidens&#x02014;it avails itself equally of the remnants of far-off
times, furnished by an archaeology moving beyond Winckelmannian classicism
and hellenism, a move whose specific implications for Greek modernism are
outlined by Gregory Jusdanis in this issue. But Picasso's Iberian heads
and Le Corbusier's polychromed Moschophorous are not reference points
along a scientifically established timeline, but end-runs around the
inevitability of archaeological chronology: before and outside history,
so temporally distant as to escape the taint of historicism&#x02014;and
thereby ripe for exploitation by modernism.
<p>
So it is when Christian Zervos founds the journal <i>Cahiers d'art</i>
in 1926. Subtitling the publication "Revue d'actualit&#x000E9; artistique"
(Review of artistic contemporaneity), Zervos underlines its commitment to
the latest and most cutting-edge artistic production. The <i>Cahiers</i>
showcase the cream of the avant-garde crop: Braque, Gris, L&#x000E9;ger,
Matisse. Above all, they champion Picasso, Zervos's particular favorite,
whose work he would present in a thirty-three-volume catalogue
raisonn&#x000E9; beginning in 1932.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
But Zervos's insistence on the modernity of contemporary art goes hand
in hand with a presentation of the archaeological object in the power
of its alterity. Implicitly reframed by juxtaposition with cubist
painting and International architecture, the artifacts unearthed in
archaeological excavation shake off their dust and present a brave
new face to the world. From the first issues, the <i>Cahiers</i> ran
articles on Cycladic rines and Cretan faience, on Etruscan mural
painting and Mesopotamian pottery. For some contributors, the importance
of this material lay in its crystallization of an untainted originary
moment in human existence: Hans M&#x000FC;hlestein devotes a five-part
investigation to "The Origins of Art and Culture" in the <i>Cahiers</i>
for 1930, which is introduced with an explicit call for a "return to the
source." "Whoever has a true interest in art cannot be satisfied with
the doctrines inspired by classicism, which rest only on a derivative
conception of an anterior state where instinct plays the most active
role. They are only a consequence: we must go back to the origin."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
The implicit substitution of a good archaic history for a degenerate
classical one may just replicate a shifting archaeological
chronology. More radical is the gesture Zervos himself advocates:
wrenching objects out of their context so that the journal becomes
the forum for encounters between the past and the present, "in order
to show the unity of the human spirit under its surface complexity,
and the modernity of the great works of the past."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
It is in this spirit that Zervos enlists Georges-Henri
Rivi&#x000E8;re, student at the &#x000C9;cole du Louvre and sometime
contributor to the <i>Cahiers,</i> to kick off a series presenting
archaeological finds&#x02014;an ongoing set of avant-garde field
reports&#x02014;with a manifesto of sorts in seventh issue of the
journal. "Arch&#x000E9;ologismes," presented in extenso in the dossier
hereto, hits the high notes of vanguard-approved archaeology: not
classical but archaic; not European but world-wide; not museified but
site-specific. "Parricide daughter of humanism," archaeology is its own
worst enemy, toppling the museums it seeks to feed and revealing life
where it sought to document history. At the same time, Rivi&#x000E8;re
lauds the fruitful archaeological dig and hardnosed archaeological
rigor. Archaeology


<b></b>


shows us, not the course of civilization, but the force of the
object&#x02014;modern and ancient are equal; Minos, divested of his
legends, reclaims his palaces, their treasures, their frescos. (Arthur
Evans, the excavator of Minoan Knossos, certainly colluded in wresting
his archaeological finds from a detached and prehistoric past with his
modernist reconstructions of the site and its society&#x02014;they appear
distinctively contemporary.) In a warning sadly unheeded by many of his
colleagues, Rivi&#x000E8;re concludes, "those who expect to return to
the source will find fog . . ."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
In Rivi&#x000E8;re's series, ceramics from Knossos and sculptures
from China rub shoulders with etchings by Braque and paintings by
L&#x000E9;ger. It is not long before his presentations move from print
to museum, as his archaeologisms lead him to organize a celebrated
exhibit of the American Indian collections at the Trocad&#x000E9;ro in
1928 and from there to a career in museological innovation, showcasing
archaeological objects for their artistic and cultural creativity.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
This archaeology is no longer metaphorical but utilitarian, a machine
for producing objects whose alterity undergirds revolution.

<h4>
<!--_b-head-->
Interlude. 1937: The End of History
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
"Be that as it may, history has ended."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
When Alexandre Koj&#x000E8;ve explicated Hegel's <i>Phenomenology of the
Spirit</i> to the Parisian intellectual elite between 1933 and 1939,
history became no longer a set of stuffy traditions to be violently
abandoned. It was done, finished, reduced to a few posthumous spasms and
an internecine debate over whether Napol&#x000E9;on or Stalin was its last
avatar. Georges Bataille, whose archaeological interests are discussed
by Carrie Noland in these pages, writes Koj&#x000E8;ve in 1937 in bemused
agreement with his analysis: "I grant (as a likely supposition) that
from now on history is ended (except for the denouement)."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
It is during this denouement that an irregular attendee of Bataille's
experimental "Coll&#x000E8;ge de sociologie," Walter Benjamin, was hunched
over a reading desk in the Biblioth&#x000E8;que nationale, assembling
material for his monumental <i>Arcades Project</i>. The debris of history
surveyed by Benjamin's rearguard angel is exhaustingly exhumed and laid
out in this accumulation of historical objects, which consistently
seeks to "blast the continuity of history." What Jens Malte Fischer
has called an "archaeology of bourgeois interiors"
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
finds its justification in resisting the subsumption of those objects
into narration.

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In fact, an object of history cannot be targeted at all within the
continuous elapse of history. And so, from time immemorial, historical
narration has simply picked out an object from this continuous
succession. But it has done so without foundation, as an expedient;
and its first thought was then always to reinsert the object into the
continuum, which it would create anew through empathy. Materialist
historiography does not choose its objects arbitrarily. It does not
fasten on them but rather springs them loose from the order of succession.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
If the historical continuity implied by some archaeology is rewritten
as ontogeny by Freud and repudiated as oppressive by the avant-gardes,
its end, or explosion, will require a new relationship to its objects. The
unfinished heap of material making up the <i>Arcades Project</i> suggests
the hazards of such an undertaking.

3. 1961: The Archaeology of That Silence
<!--_/b-head-->
</h4>

<p>
The award for the most extensive use of the term archaeology to describe
humanistic undertaking goes, of course, to Michel Foucault. Yet when
Foucault invokes archaeology in the preface to the first edition of
<i>Folie et d&#x000E9;raison</i> (Madness and Civilization), it is easy
to gloss over the reference as unremarkable. Bemoaning the silencing of
madness by its constitution as a mental illness, Foucault counters with
his plans for recovery. "The language of psychiatry, which is a monologue
of reason about madness, has been established only on the basis of such
a silence. / I have not tried to write the history of that language,
but rather the archaeology of that silence."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
The inspiration here seems still to be a metaphorics of
excavation&#x02014;a silence buried under layers of reason's chatter
yearns only to be unearthed so that, like Freud's stones, it too might
speak. As a philosophical gesture, it repeats the same distracted wave
of the hand with which Jean Cavaill&#x000E8;s treats phenomenology as
an archaeology&#x02014;for its depth model of epistemology.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The same appears to be the case when Foucault subtitles <i>Birth of
the Clinic</i> "an archaeology of medical perception [<i>regard</i>],"
although here perhaps the flavor of rigorous scientific inquiry into
the past is added to the mix as well. As it turns out, though, these
archaeologies contain seeds of a complexity only hinted at by their
initial uses.
<p>
What it all adds up to, we learn in <i>The Archaeology of Knowledge</i>,
is the redescription in terms of topology and stratigraphy of what used to
belong to chronology. "There was a time when archaeology, as a discipline
devoted to silent monuments, inert traces, objects without context,
and things left by the past, aspired to the condition of history, and
attained meaning only through the restitution of a historical discourse;
it might be said, to play on words a little, that in our time history
aspires to the condition of archaeology, to the intrinsic description
of the monument."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Foucault's archaeology provides a description of discourses in their
positivity, just as Rivi&#x000E8;re's provides a description of Minoan
palaces without their legends. At the end of history&#x02014;here, history
as the story of the subject <i>man</i>&#x02014;it is ironically archaeology
that, stripped of its narrativizing propensities, can once again serve
to describe the past. That Foucault precisely rejects the depth model
of interpretation that archaeological excavation would seem to invite,
and indeed repudiates the very notion of object, serves only to show
the many points of contact between a multifaceted archaeology and the
complex variegations of modern epistemology.

&#x02014;An Archaeological Glossary
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
We have outlined what may be called the duplicity of the archaeological
object and have tracked aspects of some archaeological modernisms
that work upon this duplicity, playing the fragment against context in
relation to epistemology, temporality and emancipation. We will amplify
our illustration of three archaeological moments with a glossary. Many
of the terms here are tropes&#x02014;in particular, narrative scenarios,
character types and metaphors.

surfaces&#x02014;depths
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
The archaeological matrix, sometimes called the archaeological record,
is considered as an amalgam of layers. The concept of stratigraphy is
used to decode this amalgam.
<p>
In this decoding, the archaeologist digs down to find meaning. But digging
stratigraphically is impossible without the concept of horizontal surface
interface&#x02014;edges, moments of discontinuity when one layer becomes
another. The establishment of such surface discontinuity is the focus
of much archaeological excavation. And, of course, it involves sideways
movement across a surface, planning features such as walls and pits,
as one goes.
<p>
This is not simply to map the spatial coordinates of a 3-D
matrix&#x02014;the phases perhaps of a ruined building. There is no
comprehensible past down there to be discovered in some kind of 3-D
form&#x02014;for archaeology depends upon tying layers to date (there
is no innate chronology to sediment), choices of what to distinguish,
upon defining the interfaces between and across layers. The concept
of interface is thus a <i>supplement</i> to the stratigraphy&#x02014;an
immaterial concept external to layering, but essential to it.

<i>
<!--_c-head-->
origins&#x02014;continuity
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Much archaeology is a quest for contemporary origins (this is where and
when we come from) and is thus premised upon a continuity between past
and present.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
(dis)continuity&#x02014;shock
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Of course there is a particular and material continuity that lends
extraordinary force to notions of geneaological continuity&#x02014;the
materiality of the past has survived, ruined and decayed, but nevertheless
present to the archaeologist.
<p>
The materiality of loss, however, the experience that so much is gone,
that so little remains as inheritance, is simultaneously the ground
for radical discontinuity. The implications are threefold. First: The
waste and loss that may be the real story of history means that ideas of
sociocultural continuity (of community, identity, technology, progress)
may be quite literally groundless. Second: The fragments of history
attest to massive lacunae, and assembling the pieces as a narrative can
only occur locally, if at all. Third: Radical historical discontinuity
throws suspicion on accounts and narratives that depend upon notions of
sociocultural and biological similarity that transcend history (notions,
for example, of universal human values). Radical discontinuity may thus
mean a shock of radical difference.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
difference&#x02014;primitivism
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Evolutionary schemes play upon a past that is different from the present
in being at an earlier, more primitive stage. Here discontinuity is
explicitly and intimately tied to grand metanarratives of historical
contintuity.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
authenticity&#x02014;aura
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Depth and origin are often equated with authenticity.
<p>
An authentic artifact may be considered to possess aura. And aura,
of course, may involve a sense of distance and difference.
<p>
The grounds for authenticity and aura are material&#x02014;the piece of
the past has survived and its materiality is witness to this survival,
its metonymical bridging of time and making good of loss.

<!--_c-head-->
embodiment&#x02014;document
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
The material past is encountered unspoken, and is ultimately ineffable
(but see mute-ability). Here is a profound question that can only be
resolved as fatally flawed translation&#x02014;how are we to document
the past on the basis of its fragmentary material remains? We can only
interminably scribble on the ruins which always hold back more than ever
could be said or pictured.
<p>
Encountering the archaeological past is distinctively
sensory&#x02014;embodied. Just like memory, we feel as much as rationally
decode the past. This is associated with its ineffability&#x02014;it is
often <i>only</i> felt. Reactions may range from fascination through
disgust to veneration of the sacred.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
the fieldworker
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Engages with archaeological places, and decontextualizes site and
artifact, rips them from their setting, for there are only ever fragments,
and choices must be made, of what elicits attention, of what to record,
of what to conserve.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
topography&#x02014;topology
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Ruins in the land&#x02014;this is one of the sites of archaeology. It may
be conceived as "the field."
<p>
Sites may be represented as coordinates&#x02014;spatial grid reference. They
may be described topographically. More accurately, and with Michel Serres,
their representation requires a <i>topology</i> that can deal with
the palimpsest that is landscape&#x02014;the percolating time that folds
together the many fragmentary traces of pasts present in any one place.

systematics&#x02014;loss
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
The archaeologist faces a mound of debris. One way of making good the loss
inherent in the fragment is to define categories and classify. Writing
catalogs.
<p>
Or, in choosing a systematics that eschews the construction of a coherent
historical narrative (inadequately based upon scattered archaeological
fragments), archaeologists may instead approximate an artifactual
cladistics.

ruin&#x02014;entropy
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
The loss that is at the heart of the archaeological project&#x02014;history
as ruin&#x02014;is a precisely modernist experience of the twentieth
century. How can we hold on to the mass of information and detail,
the lives descending into chaos?

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
horror&#x02014;abjection
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
There is horror not only in the metamorphic processes of decay
that apply to our own materiality. But also in the entropy that is
history&#x02014;the tendency to misunderstand (so much is missing), the
drift into formlessness. Then there is the sickening loss that is the
horror of history&#x02014;the wasted lives. So much thrown away.
<p>
A forensic horror too, as at the scene of a crime&#x02014;the chance find
of a finger bone or tooth (or, so often now, the mass grave of anonymous
victims) attesting to . . .

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
symptomatic logic&#x02014;forensics
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
At a scene of crime anything might be relevant. The archaeological site
is cognate with the crime scene. The tiny fragment may be significant
and provide a clue to some deeper meaning or knowledge. The fragment or
trace is here conceived as a kind of clue or symptom.


<b></b>


<p>
In a symptomatic logic superficial and isolated finds, events and
observations are linked to underlying process. A symptom may lead to
medical diagnosis. An archaeological find may track the migration of an
ethnic group.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
forensics&#x02014;anthropometrics
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
The desire is for some kind of control over the incidental details,
a system that might lead to identification. Just as Francis Galton and
Alphonse Bertillon, and a nineteenth-century will to knowledge, codified
and cataloged fingerprints and ears, the shape of eyebrows in a forensic
anthropology, a physiognomic science of character, race and conformity,
so too did, do, archaeologists collect skulls and flint tools, measuring
and comparing in a systematization of ancient race and cultural industry.

the connoisseur
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Their esoteric knowledge is based upon tying apparently incidental detail
to the authority of the catalog. In such attribution of item to class
the connoisseur judges quality and value.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
the collector
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
Recontextualizing fragments. The collection is always more than an
account of the past and more than the sum of its parts. It is rooted in
heterogeneous association. The collector is fascinated by the life of
an artifact&#x02014;its journey through making, use, discard, recovery,
re-collection.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
re-collection
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
It is not only that archaeologists gather fragments and
build collections. Like memory, the work of archaeology is
re-collection&#x02014;the reinsertion of pieces of the past into a form
that carries significance in the present, carried forward from the
past. As in memory, the (archaeological) traces of the past do not
constitute a timeline or linear account. They resonate with a present
experienced moment; this is what precipitates their reemergence, their
recollection. This is actuality.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
absence and negativity
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
It is not that the archaeological past is absent. It is more precisely
not present. Or, we might say the trace means the past is absent in its
presence. Archaeology is a dynamic of presence and absence.
<p>
In this dynamic, all historical culture is residual. There is a negativity
represented by the loss of the past, its absence. This negativity is
the only condition for knowledge of the past&#x02014;waste and garbage
are the condition of historical insight and knowledge.

<p>
<i>
<!--_c-head-->
agent and artifact
<!--_/c-head-->
</i>

<p>
What is the distinction between the history of human agents and the
history of material traces? Between people and tools? People and artifacts
have, we may say, been intertwined for as long as there have been modern
humans. We have always been cyborgs, material agents, embodied agents,
materially located agents, people conceivable as things, artifacts
playing active roles in society and history.


<b></b>


<p>
Material culture, the subject of archaeology and a new interdisciplinary
field (material culture studies) that also includes anthropology,
sociology, economics, design, and art history, is thus something of
a tautology&#x02014;because human history (of culture) has always been
material, in the social fabric, in the materiality of human agents.
<p>
Archaeology thus, potentially, merges with natural history, as it did in
its antiquarian beginnings, as chorography mingled topography with writing
on nature, with speculation on field monuments, with philological focus
upon place names, with an interest in old things found, in the animal
and plant species of a landscape.
<p>
To what extent is the individual agent lost in the tide of history? Is
archaeology best understood as the evolution of species of tools? Are
overarching structures (social, cultural, biological) the real subject
of deep human time?

<!--_a-head-->
New Archaeological Histories
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
We have histories of published ideas in archaeology, and histories of
class determination in the creation of archaeological knowledges. One
of the aims of this collection is to contribute to a new history of
archaeological dispositions, of the forms of a cultural imaginary centered
upon traces of the past in the present, their metamorphoses in the
interests of modernists and antiquarians, the fears and gratifications.
<p>
Another goal of this special issue is to show that despite modernist
critique of antiquarianism, the connections between modern culture and
archaeology are multiple and productive. The twin poles of association
evoked by Duchamp's shovel&#x02014;a metaphorics of embodied excavation
and a turn to the accumulated, to the object&#x02014;resonate powerfully
with modernist thought. Between&#x02014;and beyond&#x02014;these poles lies a
complex of notions: archaism and primitivism, topography, stratigraphy,
cladistics, that speaks to the richness of this encounter. What follows
is an attempt to begin a discussion between archaeologists and humanists
about the vectors of its continuation.
