<P>
When I was a boy the New York <I>Daily Mirror</I> ran on its masthead the
injunction from John 8:32: "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall
make ye free." I was never too young to miss the irony of that statement
on a Hearst newspaper, but I felt it <I>as</I> an irony that didn't force
me to question the ideal the masthead affirmed. I didn't, however, know
then that the apostle John and William Hearst were affirming a fundamental
tenet of late-nineteenth-century positivism. The great Enlightenment
ideal, the commitment to knowledge and rationality as a means to
progressive improvement of the human condition, found one of its last
important outlets in positivism. Let me red-facedly admit that--despite a
lifetime of rebuffs--I have not given up that commitment.

<P>
Karl Pearson participated vigorously in it. In his 1892 <I>Grammar of
Science,</I> he virtually begins, in a section called "Science and
Citizenship," by asserting that the scientific "frame of mind seems to me
an essential of good citizenship."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
If this looks suspiciously
like science as the opiate of the masses, it may also be taken as a
good-faith commitment to the view that epistemology should be driven by
human needs. Put that way, it sounds not like scientific disingenuousness
but pragmatist revisionism. Surely, Pearson's explanation has some
contemporary resonance: "Every modern citizen," he says, "is thrust into
an appalling maze of social and educational problems." And every citizen
is "called upon to form a judgment apart, if it possibly may be, from his
own feelings and emotions--a judgment in what he conceives to be the
interests of society at large" (<I>GS,</I> 10).


<B></B>


 Here an Arnoldian
ideal of disinterest joins with positivist idealizing of knowledge.

<P>
<I>The Grammar of Science,</I> the most important summary of scientific
epistemology, method, and possibility since John Herschel's <I>Preliminary
Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy</I> of 1830, embraced both
the political and epistemological ideals of a new vision for science and
society. "The goal of science is clear," Pearson concludes; "it is nothing
short of the complete interpretation of the universe" (<I>GS,</I> 18).

<P>
Against this scientific imperialism it would be easy now to succumb to the
temptation to push once again the argument that scientific
thought--ostensibly disinterested and objective--disguises self-interest
and ideological complicity. Pearson was a propagandist for strong
pre-Vienna Circle positivist theory and at the same time one of the
most active and important of eugenicists. The connection makes itself.
There can be no mistaking that his major scientific initiatives were
ideologically driven by a passion for social reform, and a reform based on
a eugenic program of racial improvement.

<P>
I want to resist that temptation. I am interested in shaking up what may
be a current critical complacency latent in the idea that all knowledge is
political. Of course. And then what? In Pearson's case, for example, there
is the fact of "statistics." Statistics as a scientific discipline given
shape and direction by Pearson is an indispensable tool of modern life. J.
B. S. Haldane once remarked that Pearson's "theory of heredity was
incorrect in some fundamental respects. So was Columbus's theory of
geography. He set out for China, and discovered America."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 It
is partly because of this apparently odd result--the growth of a valuable
science from an obviously ideologically driven enterprise--that I want to
think about the implications of his work for our own relations to
knowledge and science and politics. In addition, Pearson is a particularly
interesting subject because his theories raise echoes of contemporary
nonpositivist epistemological enterprises, and because his politics are
far more complicated--he was both socialist and feminist--than the
connection with eugenics first suggests. Pearson is, then, an ideal test
case for my tentative exploration of the possibility of recuperating some
aspects of the positivist enterprise, including certain elements of the
cognitive and something like an imagination of uncontaminated knowledge.

<P>
I don't propose, with Pearsonian hubris, to manage such a recuperation. At
best, I expect to complicate the picture: Pearson's kind of positivism
opens onto possibilities that many of us have been embracing and may
continue to embrace, both intellectually and politically.

<P>
I want, then, to go over some familiar ground about the positivist
epistemology that undergirded Pearson's idea of science, and to watch his
progress from citizenship to epistemic skepticism, to the possibility of
knowing. In doing so, I will be emphasizing aspects of his thought close
to current humanist critiques. And I do so because I believe that we have
tended to surrender too easily the value of some sort of rational and
cognitive consensus to the politically and intellectually conservative.
Positivism, certainly in the hands of Pearson, was an enterprise for human
betterment. Like all


<B></B>


such enterprises, it was therefore dangerous,
but no more so perhaps than our own anti-positivistic enterprises. It's
worth seeing where we connect with it and why it ended up in places that
have led to its dismissal.

<P>
Let me then recall that positivism, popularly conceived as dogmatic,
realistic, and fact-oriented, shares with the Nietzsche of Pearson's own
day a deep-rooted skepticism, and a perspectivist belief in the inevitable
human element buried in every "fact." It is initiated as much as a theory
of strong disbelief as of strong belief. "The improver of natural
knowledge," Huxley famously said, "absolutely refuses to acknowledge
authority as such. For him, scepticism is the highest of
duties."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The condition of strong belief is a preliminary
rejection of virtually everything one has believed. The word "positivism"
itself implies something of the Cartesian enterprise--the clearing away of
the debris of knowledge, all that is muddy and doubtable, not "clear and
distinct," for whatever foundational certainty one might find.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P>
But Pearson sought ways to resist the instability he believed in. The
movement through negations to aggressively affirmative modes of positivism
is a tricky one, based on fine description of the methods of science. Not
Cartesian in that he begins with a total commitment to empiricism, Pearson
replays Descartes's hunt for what it might be possible and necessary to
believe. He sustains at once a fundamental incredulity almost as complete
as Descartes's Great Doubt, and uses it to build a confident (if
stringently limited) way of knowing. Part of Pearson's program was the
absolute dismissal of traditional religion and metaphysics from the sphere
of knowledge; the other, "positive," part was the definition of a valid
mode of knowing.

<P>
Pearson tries to argue both that everything is in principle knowable and
that anything that lies outside sense impression is unknowable. This is a
particularly difficult maneuver, initiating the positivist strategy of
dismissing empirically indeterminable questions as nonsense, yet allowing
that maybe, yes, someday, we might know about reality. But we are too
ignorant to know whether we can know it. He finds the positive modes of
knowledge where we might expect, in science. "Wherever there is the
slightest possibility for the human mind to <I>know,</I> there is a
legitimate problem of science" (<I>GS,</I> 23). But, finally, to make
science valid on his terms and sweep up any metaphysical residue, he
rejects all claims that science is about reality.

<P>
Pearson's world is familiar to those who know Nietzsche's transformation
of knowledge into fiction. Kant's "thing in itself" is as much fiction to
Pearson as to Nietzsche; science is a mode of interpreting rather than a
representation of the real. Pearson argues that we know only our own
consciousnesses, that the world is in effect a construct of our
consciousness (where have we heard this before?). Strictly speaking, the
scientist discovers nothing: he is an inventor. The laws of nature owe
their existence to the creative power of man's intellect: "There is," says
Pearson, "more meaning in the statement that man gives laws to Nature than
in its converse that Nature gives law to man" (<I>GS,</I> 77). Pearson's
kind of positivism probably provided much of the intellectual ground for
the paradoxes of Oscar Wilde, who was unusually knowledgeable about
science, and a close reader of the naturalists, T. H.


<B></B>


Huxley, W. K.
Clifford, and John Tyndall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Here, in effect, Pearson says, as
Wilde would, that nature imitates art, not vice versa.

<P>
Pearson retreats from all large knowledge claims to one fundamental
recognition--not so much a cogito as a "sentio": I experience, therefore a
certain "routine of perception" (<I>GS,</I> 111, passim) exists. Routine
of perception is Pearson's antimetaphysically chilling formula for what
others might call reality, the regularity of impressions that allows the
mind to invent laws of nature. Scientists simply describe accurately and
economically the routine of those perceptions, through which it becomes
possible to infer past and future routines of perception. Such empiricist
orthodoxy threatens the very stability it seeks and entails further
recuperative moves. There are no "laws of nature," only descriptions of
routines of perception. This purging of reality and metaphysics leaves
positivism hovering over an abyss of nonknowing. (Note that the pragmatist
tradition shares intimately with this positivist one the refusal to allow
for science or language as "representation," particularly as
representation of some "reality" that lies outside of anyone's
consciousness.) For Pearson as for the pragmatists, we are all bound by
the egocentric predicament.

<P>
"Science," Pearson argues, "is in reality a classification and analysis of
the contents of the mind: and the scientific method consists in drawing
just comparisons and inferences from the stored impresses of past sense
impressions, and from the conceptions based on them" (<I>GS,</I> 49). Only
by making all knowledge claims pass through the narrow funnel of
individual consciousness can Pearson make the world safe from the
incursions of metaphysics. He thus moves himself, as so many of his
contemporaries moved, inside Pater's "thick wall . . . through which no
real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we
can only conjecture to be without."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P>
Yet Pearson's socialism entailed the belief that all individuals are bound
to and subsumed under the community; his epistemology made the same
requirement, for both moral and intellectual reasons. How, then, negotiate
an empiricist subjectivity that makes it impossible to get beyond the
self? Pearson, like many others at the time, including Wilde, Tyndall, and
even Nietzsche, adopts a strategy characteristic of strayed
foundationalists, the biologistic appeal to evolution.

<P>
Pearson replaces foundations with "normality." "The universal validity of
science depends," he says, "upon the similarity of the perceptive and
reasoning faculties in normal civilized men" (<I>GS,</I> 45); and for "a
conception to have scientific validity [it] must be <I>deducible</I> from
the perceptions of the normal human being" (<I>GS,</I> 50). Scientific
universality "has only meaning insofar as we refer to a certain type of
perceptive faculty, namely, that of a normal human being" (<I>GS,</I> 75).

<P>
The Foucauldian critique waits in the wings, but I defer it to get clear
how Pearson makes his epistemological maneuvers. Minds, he says, are
machines, and if they don't act adequately in response to stimulation, "we
say that the mind is disordered, the reason wanting, the person mad"
(<I>GS,</I> 88-89). Normality is, then, a power of evolutionary
survival. In an Erewhonian way, error becomes illness, and Pearson's
epistemology reaches out beyond mind to the body that seems to house it.
For the mad person, "The fitting exertion would not follow the sense
impression, and any


<B></B>


such man would have small chance of surviving
among men whose perceptive and reasoning faculties were attuned"
(<I>GS,</I> 91). Interestingly, in Wilde's notebooks there is an entry
under the heading <I>"Survival of Fittest in Thought"</I> that reads:
"Nature kills off all those who do not believe in the Uniformity of Nature
and the Law of Causation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Thus, with no access to other
people's minds, Pearson believes he can, with the concept of normality,
validate knowledge claims.

<P>
But another epistemological step, some antimetaphysical tool for knowing,
is required. The crucial instrument Pearson finds, learned of course from
Francis Galton, is "correlation." Things remain unknown, but a "sequence"
of impressions can be known. We will never find out what causes the
impressions, never get behind the screen of consciousness, and yet what we
find out will be enough to increase our chances of survival. Statistics,
in effect, becomes the basis of an antimetaphysical science in that it
allows the invention of laws to describe in the most economical possible
way the sequences of events--woops, impressions. If I experience this, I
am also likely to experience that. Such language replaces the idea of
cause, a word Pearson is willing to use only in a revised sense.
Probability contains the idea of "provability," as Pearson himself notes.
Taking into account the underdetermination of pure empirical evidence,
Pearson finds that statistics provides a convincing description of the
world, that is, of the routine. The "clear and distinct" of Descartes
gives way to "probability." Science moves from representation of reality
to statistical correlation. "Henceforward," he wrote, "the philosophical
view of the universe was to be that of a correlated system of variates,
approaching but by no means reaching perfect correlation, i. e., absolute
causality" (<I>GS,</I> 188). In <I>The Grammar of Science</I> the
metaphysics of causality becomes the science of correlation.

<P>
All of this is very clever. Yet, res don't lie, but liars re, and
we know that Pearson measured things for which he had totally inadequate
information; that he posited entities like normal mental acuity, for which
he had no justification; that he rejected Mendel's results in a
closed-minded and rather unscientific way. Even on the grounds of
conventional science, these can be detected as errors. But note in how
many different ways the idea of correlation and statistics satisfies
epistemological needs. Correlation makes no absolute claims about
relationship; it only registers that a relationship can be inferred. The
numbers used to establish correlation are comfortably free from the
personal, and the trick is only (a) to make sure you are counting the
right things, (b) to make sure you are asking the right questions in the
right way, and (c) to make sure that the mathematics is correct.
Correlative statistics seems to provide an algorithm for action and, as
William James would have seen it critically, precludes the one real
necessity, the need and responsibility to choose. But James's critique
does not preclude the necessity for shareable knowledge. And what I want
to emphasize here is Pearson's brilliant effort to construct the
shareable, rather than to insist on its adequacy.

<P>
When I first read Pearson I didn't know of his connections with eugenics,
and I followed the circuits of his argument without trying to resist.
Pearson's social goals were allied to his science because he believed that
true knowledge was attainable,


<B></B>


and that once attained it would carry
sufficient weight to guide political and moral action. Current strategies
of the critique of science manifest similar attempts to demonstrate a set
of facts (the incoherence of the narrative of ideal science, for example)
in order to produce social goals. Donna Haraway, for example, imagines a
science that would make "a no-nonsense commitment to faithful accounts of
a 'real' world, one that can be partially shared and friendly to
earth-wide projects of finite freedom, adequate material abundance, modest
meaning in suffering, and limited happiness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 I'm not trying
to equate Haraway and Pearson, but to call attention to a fundamental
similarity in their projects: science tries to provide the best possible
description of its subject in order to produce a social ideal. This is not
the normal way philosophers and scientists themselves talk about science
these days, yet the roll call of those who connect the project of science
with social goals is impressive--Francis Bacon, John Herschel, Huxley,
Pearson, Karl Popper, Bruno Latour, Haraway.

<P>
The usual idea that the intrusion of social and personal ambitions into
the working of science disrupts the possibility of disinterest and
therefore of true knowledge might well, as in Pearson's case, have it
backwards. Since there is no escaping the pressure of the subjective in
the act of knowing, the moral recognition of the primary need to confirm
knowledge with others and to sustain the larger community in conditions of
equity and fairness could in fact lead to the sorts of disciplined
restraint of the personal that could lend credibility to assertion.

<P>
The attempt to make statistics a perfect epistemological machine that
allows impersonality in a system otherwise inevitably biased was an
important enterprise in its effort--perhaps excessive--to get beyond the
personal, to discipline the desires, to penetrate the disguises of
ideology. That Pearson developed various statistical strategies through
his biometric work has not invalidated those strategies. That the
ingenuities of science have been touched by the pressures of money,
ambition, and social hierarchy has not diminished the importance of its
modes of knowing. Pearson's epistemology, the positivist ecstasy (or
effort to stand outside the self) and social critiques of science each
tend to set their sights far too high. They each assume that the only way
to achieve rational authority in knowledge is to distinguish radically the
knower from the act of knowing, and absolutely and austerely to refuse to
affirm any knowledge that lacks the authority of valid evidence, however
that may be defined. This is veritably a Cartesian standard of doubt, and
it exemplifies what Rom Harr&eacute; has called "the fallacy of 'high
redefinition.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
It is not clear to me that although beginning with several assumptions not
available to Pearson--that the eugenic project is an evil one, that
science has been driven in part at least by strong nonrational forces, and
that it has not been an unequivocal force for good--current strategies of
negotiating with skepticism and with the impossibility of ideal
self-repression are clearly an improvement on Pearson's. Ironically,
positivism and its enemies negotiate the same difficulties with the same
end: an ideal of valid, shareable, humanly usable knowledge. The excesses
of resistance to the inescapability of the partial in the projects of
knowledge and good citizenship do not negate the projects. It's not that
science and citizenship are oxymoronic, only that our


<B></B>


definitions
of these terms need modification in the light of ideas like Pearson's and
in the light of his failures.

<P>
Current strategies for negotiating with skepticism and with the
impossibility of self-repression are not self-evidently an improvement on
Pearson's. The ideal of disinterest still has work to do in our society.
The ideal of modest truth claims, connected to disinterest, has yet more
work to do.

<P>
For Pearson science, broadly, was rigorous thinking that makes the minimal
possible claims based on the fullest possible experience in order to
improve the quality of human life. I am not arguing for this epistemology,
but for a recognition of our continuing investment in his kind of
epistemology, for the importance of attempting to reaffirm the possibility
of human connection through rational understanding and knowledge, and our
responsibility for it.
