Among her meditations on French character and "civilisation," Gertrude Stein's <i>Paris France</i>  includes a quick dismissal of the "sur-realist crowd":



<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
That was really the trouble with the sur-realist crowd, they missed their moment of becoming civilized, they used their revolt, not as a private but as a public thing, they wanted publicity not civilisation, and so really they never succeeded in being peaceful and exciting.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>
 

<p>
This passage may seem counter-intuitive coming from Stein, who is often seen as a paradigmatic re of the avant-garde and who regularly demonstrated her own genius at cultivating and negotiating publicity. The "sur-realist crowd," representatives <i>par excellence</i> of what Peter B&#x000FC;rger has termed "the historical avant-garde," would seem a group for whom Stein would feel affinities rather than antagonism, not least a shared desire for publicity.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  But here and elsewhere in <i>Paris France</i>, Stein develops a set of subtle distinctions between her own project and the surrealist project. While her version of publicity embraces literary institutions and their role in creating literary history, the surrealist version depends on claims to pure originality and revolt. While her project celebrates an ideal of "civilisation" built over time through an accretion of daily behaviors, the Surrealists' preoccupation with "revolt" leads them to miss "their moment of becoming civilized." While Stein applies a dialectical understanding 


<b></b>


of habit as both stultifying <i>and</i> enabling of original thought and action, the Surrealist movement depends on the fiction that one can dispense with habits of thought and action altogether. While gradualism, accretion, continuity, and recontextualization define Stein's work, she sees the surrealist movement as characterized by iconoclasm, rupture, and opposition.

<p>
In this paper I distinguish Stein's project from the surrealist project, and from avant-garde projects more generally, by defining a version of modernism that grows out of American pragmatism rather than out of a continental avant-garde tradition. The two movements are not as distant as one might think; indeed, Ross Posnock argues that pragmatism shares a good deal with the avant-garde, including commitments to replacing "theory with practice, the a priori with contingency, clarity with shock, [and] information with immersion."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Despite these similarities, the dominance of the avant-garde tradition in historical, theoretical, and philosophical narratives of modernism has obscured one of pragmatism's most characteristic and potentially useful contributions to theories of art, culture, and politics: its commitment to what I call a "recontextualizing" rather than an "oppositional" mode of criticism.

<p>
Despite many influential revisions of modernism&#x02014;under the banners of feminism, racial politics, and mass culture, to name just a few&#x02014;the oppositional model associated with avant-gardism remains dominant. Not only does this model continue to set the terms of discussion for questions of modernism and avant-gardism, but it seems more generally to define popular understandings of "political art." Andreas Huyssen, for example, in his influential treatment of modernism and mass culture, describes the avant-garde in the language of opposition, claiming that the avant-garde depends upon an "iconoclastic and anti-aesthetic ethos, which attempt[s] to break the political bondage of high culture . . . and to integrate art into life."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Likewise, in B&#x000FC;rger's terms, avant-garde movements aim to produce for their readers and viewers an effect of "shock . . . as a stimulus to change one's conduct of life; it is the means to break through aesthetic immanence and to usher in (initiate) a change in the recipient's life praxis" (<i>TAG</i>, 80).

<p>
This model, with its emphasis on breaking through, shock, or, as Posnock puts it, "heroic opposition and a shattering of conventions," has offered a potent alternative to bourgeois complacency for generations of avant-garde artists and theorists. At the same time, its dominance renders illegible other forms of innovative or radical artistic work and other styles of navigation between the aesthetic and the social. "This understanding of cultural critique," continues Posnock, "forecloses a subtler, if less glamorous, alternative, one founded on the mundane fact that our experience of the social order is one of contradiction&#x02014;that we are at once within and without it."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The "subtler, if less glamorous alternative" that I call "pragmatic modernism" thus defies traditional understandings of modernism and of cultural critique. It works within institutions; it prefers to educate rather than to convert, to contextualize rather than to defamiliarize. Its power as a mode of critique and as a version of praxis deserves further attention from critics of modernism and within discussions of aesthetics and politics more generally.


<b></b>


<p>
What follows is a preliminary exploration of pragmatic modernism's recontextualizing mode by way of one of its key terms, habit. I take habit as a pragmatist "keyword" in Raymond Williams's sense: a "strong, difficult, and persuasive" word that takes on specialized meanings within the context of pragmatist philosophy, meanings with the potential to significantly enrich and expand our understanding of modernism beyond the oppositional model exemplified by the historical avant-garde.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 

<p>
In taking pragmatist "habit" as my pivotal term, I hope to illuminate the distinctions and the similarities between avant-gardism and pragmatic modernism. Though William James's definition of habit in <i>Principles of Psychology</i> is straightforward ("habit diminishes the conscious attention with which our acts are performed"), this mundane term takes on global importance for both James and John Dewey, linking the psychological to the social in both men's work.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Though the pragmatists were hardly the first to address the idea of habit&#x02014;Walter Pater had in 1873 declared that "our failure is to form habits"&#x02014;pragmatists took a different approach to the problem than their recent precursors.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Rather than pathologizing habits of thought, as the Romantics and the Aestheticists had done, and calling for an end to or a breaking through of habit, pragmatism saw habit as constitutive of&#x02014;and utterly necessary to&#x02014;thought and social behavior. In returning to this more Aristotelian model, it subtly shifted the meaning of the term. Rather than a set of compulsions or a mere mindless automatism, pragmatist habit was reborn as a site of personal and social potential. 

<p>
For James, the roots of habit are physiological. He argues that "the nervous system" follows old impulses and paths more easily than new ones. But habit also provides a conceptual apparatus through which he links individual nerve endings to social and institutional structures. Habit connects the specific to the abstract and the body to the body politic, in more than a merely metaphorical sense. While it links conceptually the mindless motions of the body to the social mores that determine human values, beliefs, and actions, it also signals an organic conception of history, temporally connecting past behaviors to future impulses. This pragmatist approach to history, in which the past is seen as inevitably influential, for better <i>and</i> for worse, presents a dramatic alternative to visionary and revolutionary rejections of all that had come before.

<p>
Avant-garde theories of art have their own treatments of habit. Shklovsky's famous discussion of defamiliarization in "Art as Technique," for instance, claims that "[h]abitualization devours works, clothes, furniture, one's wife, and the fear of war . . . And art exists that one may recover the sensation of life; it exists to make one feel things, to make the stone <i>stony</i>."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Whether addressed directly or indirectly, habit's numbing, deadening qualities invariably furnish the adversary against which the avant-garde artist must struggle. With habit's anesthetic qualities taken for granted, the manifestoes of avant-garde movements from the Surrealists to the Vorticists focus on the moment of defamiliarization or shock&#x02014;the moment at which daily habits are punctured and illuminations and transrations can take place. Words like "destruction," "negativity," "smash," and "demolition" appear again and again in avant-garde manifestoes, from Futurist images of car crashes and shell explosions to <i>Blast</i>'s call for a cultural violence that will "destroy politeness, standardisation and academic, that is civilized, vision."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 


<b></b>


<p>
Pragmatism, on the other hand, while it shares an interest in revealing invisible habits and in challenging mindless habits of thought, interests itself not only in the moment of shock itself, but also in the moments that precede and follow shock. As Dewey claims in <i>Human Nature and Conduct</i> , 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Without habit there is only irritation and confused hesitation. With habit alone there is a machine-like repetition, duplicating recurrence of old acts. <i>With conflict of habits and release of impulse there is conscious search</i> 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
What makes Dewey's discussion characteristically pragmatist is its dialectical treatment of habit. He offers no alternative to habit; no space outside of habit. Rather, he describes how habit permeates every aspect of existence, cushioning us from "irritation and confused hesitation" in our everyday lives. Though he encourages an awareness of habit's anodyne effects, he is also quick to point out that habit's undoing is not achieved through a "dream of romantic freedom, in which <i>all</i> life is plastic to impulse, a continual source of improvised spontaneities and novel inspirations" and in which "[w]e rebel against all organization and all stability" (<i>HNC</i>, 72).

<p>
According to Dewey, new habits come only after a process, initiated by the moment of "conflict" and "release of impulse," which can be compared to the avant-garde moment of shock, and which inspires "conscious search." After this comes a "utilizing [of] released impulse as an agent of steady reorganization of custom and institutions" (<i>HNC</i>, 72). It is this reintegration or recontextualization of released energies back into the social fabric that distinguishes pragmatism from other critical modes of thought. The goal described here is unambiguously <i>not</i> the smashing or shattering of custom and the destruction of institutions, but their "steady reorganization."

<p>
It is easy to see how "steady reorganization" might seem somewhat pedestrian when compared to the aesthetic and political rhetorics of the avant-garde, and these differences of style and tone are reflected in generic differences as well. Along with outrageous and shocking artworks and performances, the avant-garde specialized in manifestoes, provocations, and the definitional founding statements of movements; forms especially conducive to creating flashes of momentary illumination. Pragmatism, on the other hand, developed in the far more mundane contexts of academic lectures, books, and articles, forms well adapted to the institutional contexts in which they were written or delivered. We might imagine here the staid and civilized luncheons of the Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Massachusetts in relation to the spontaneous revelries of the Surrealists at Au Chien Qui Fume or another Parisian retreat. Coming as they do from different social contexts and devoted as they are to different goals, these two movements have opposing and specialized vocabularies to offer, one a vocabulary of shock and defamiliarization and the other of "steady reorganization." Given their many shared interests and preoccupations, however, and their complementary specializations, it would seem that a greater dialogue between the two traditions could be immensely beneficial to students of both.

<p>
Indeed, if charges of complacency can be reasonably brought against pragmatism for its emphasis on the moment of reintegration over the moment of conflict or rupture


<b></b>


from convention, then the charge of empty radical posturing could be leveled against the avant-garde approach. B&#x000FC;rger insightfully underscores the difficulty with the avant-garde reliance upon shock to do the majority of its political work:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The problem with shock as the intended reaction of the recipient is that it is generally nonspecific . . . [it] does not insure that the recipient's change of behavior is given a particular direction . . . A further difficulty inheres . . . and that is the impossibility to make permanent this kind of effect. Nothing loses its effectiveness more quickly than shock; by its very nature, it is a unique experience . . . The violent reactions of the public to the mere appearance of the Dadaists are an example: newspaper reports had prepared the public for the shock; it expected it. Such a nearly institutionalized shock probably has a minimal effect on the way the recipients run their lives. The shock is 'consumed.'

<p class="noIndent">
It is precisely this question with which pragmatism concerns itself. Assuming that all shock is "consumed," and that this is the process through which habit operates, pragmatism turns its attention to managing the "consumption" of shock, or to the "steady reorganization of custom and institutions" described above. The choice, pragmatism tells us, is not between steady reorganization and total revolution but between steady reorganization and a flash of shock followed by an inevitable reversion to the status quo. Without the recontextualizing component of social change, the energies of shock disperse, leaving mindless habits of thought essentially intact.

<p class="noIndent">
Set against the backdrop of Paris, and offered in the context of urban modernity, Walter Benjamin's essay "On Some Motifs in Baudelaire" provides a glimpse of a modernist aesthetic distinct from the shock-centered aesthetic of the avant-garde. Though Benjamin's essay famously treats shock as the herald of modernity, it remains equally (and dialectically) invested in the state against which shock is counterposed in the essay: a state of unconsciousness, of deeply personal memory, of protection from stimuli, of habituated response. This oscillation between habit and shock is presented by Benjamin not as a general philosophical truth but as a peculiarly modernist problematic. Through his reading of Baudelaire, he imagines an aesthetic that remains equally attuned to the power of habit <i>and</i> to modernity's endless jolts to habit, an aesthetic that, like pragmatism, sets these two states in a necessary and ongoing relation to one another.

<p>
Benjamin's sense of habituated unconsciousness, interestingly enough, is taken from Bergson's <i>Matter and Memory</i>, a text that was both influenced by and greatly influential for the work of William James. Bergson, Benjamin claims in his essay, treats "experience" as "a matter of tradition, in collective existence as well as private life. It is less the product of facts firmly anchored in memory than of a convergence in memory of accumulated and frequently unconscious data."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Putting this "accumulated and frequently unconscious data" at the center of experience, and claiming it as a link between 


<b></b>


collective and private existence, Bergson offers a notion of human thought and behavior that powerfully recalls pragmatist habit. Like Dewey and James, he attempts to theorize the difference between conscious and unconscious behaviors, to link the psychological to the social, and to connect impulses of the body with tendencies of the mind.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 

<p>
Benjamin's hesitation about Bergsonian experience is that it creates a dehistoricized and abstracted vision of modernity:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It is . . . not at all Bergson's intention to attach any specific historical label to memory. On the contrary, he rejects any historical determination of memory. He thus manages above all to stay clear of that experience from which his own philosophy evolved or, rather, in reaction to which it arose. It was the inhospitable, blinding age of big-scale industrialism. In shutting out this experience the eye perceives an experience of a complementary nature in the form of its spontaneous afterimage, as it were . . . His philosophy thus indirectly furnishes a clue to the experience which presented itself to Baudelaire's eyes in its undistorted version in the re of his reader.

<p class="noIndent">
In other words, Bergsonian experience is as important for what it does not record as for what it does. The "blinding age of big-scale industrialism" determines the nature of both Bergsonian memory and Bergsonian experience, but its traces are concealed. Present as a palpable absence, or "spontaneous afterimage," history is dispersed from experience. As Benjamin goes on to argue, modern shock thus becomes a means of "emancipation from experience"&#x02014;a mode of re-entry into history, into a specific time and place. Shock is also the necessary precondition for consciousness, and, for this reason "Baudelaire placed the shock experience at the very center of his artistic work" ("SMB," 163).

<p>
Benjamin's critique of Bergsonian experience and his description of modern shock thus offer a historicized version of habit perfectly suited to discussions of literary and social modernity. Whereas pragmatism and avant-gardism could each be said to suggest a hierarchy, emphasizing either the constructive, accumulating qualities of habit or the illuminating, defamiliarizing benefits of shock, Benjamin places habit and shock together in the context of the urban crowd, the "industrial work process" ("SMB," 176), the newspaper, and the photograph. For Benjamin the oscillation between shock and habit, between conscious and unconscious behavior, is defined and limited not only by the romantic spontaneity of the avant-garde artist or the "steady reorganization" of the pragmatist social engineer but by the ruling social conditions as well. Benjamin rejects the avant-gardist's romantic celebration of shock as a sign of modernity working exclusively against the primitive habits of the past. At the same time, he complicates and contextualizes the pragmatist tendency to see better habits of the future as an emancipation from the outmoded metaphysics of revolution. He puts both habit and shock in their historical place: the repetitions of series production and the explosion of the flashbulb become representations of a dialectic of habit newly charged with social meaning.

<p>
To read habit through Benjamin's essay on Baudelaire is to illuminate elements of his work not easily assimilable to received notions of avant-gardism. By reading modern 


<b></b>


shock against Bergsonian experience, Benjamin contextualizes both the romanticized notion of the oppositional hero-artist and the abstract philosophical pendulum-swing of habit. In so doing, Benjamin's essay demonstrates a set of relationships and a mode of analysis representative of pragmatic modernism. Just as Benjamin's interest in unconscious habit (or Bergsonian experience) would never be read as complacency or as satisfaction with the status quo, pragmatic modernism's recontextualizing mode should not be read as antithetical to engaged criticism. Rather, it should be read as a mode of criticism that distinguishes itself from the powerful ideology of oppositional criticism, one that interests itself both in moments of shock and rupture and in the historical conditions and surrounding events that produce and respond to such moments. 

<p>
It is in this light that I read Stein's discussion of the relation between publicity, in the form of an attention-grabbing performance or outrageous manifesto, and civilization, in the form of daily behaviors accumulated over time. Her criticism of the Surrealists grows out of more than mere rivalry and can be read as an endorsement of the recontextualizing mode. As with Benjamin, Stein's interest in the power of habit is animated by historically specific energies&#x02014;discussions of war, mechanical reproduction, cinema, and national identity are each linked to habit's dialectic. In the following sections, I turn to Stein, an author usually subsumed to the tradition of avant-garde modernism, to show at greater length what pragmatic modernism looks like in action.

<p class="noIndent">
Habit in Stein, as in James and Dewey, is never merely a problem to be overcome, a failure of imagination, or a "machine-like repetition" (<i>HNC</i>, 126). It is the smallest component part into which thought and behavior can be broken down, and through which they are built back up. Stein takes as one of her most serious engagements the duty of rendering habit visible: from the minutiae of daily life, to textual "habits" such as punctuation and clich&#x000E9;, to the habits that constitute national identity, to the collective habits of thought that create institutions and literary canons. Even Stein's most radically experimental works famously achieve their difficulty through repetitions. Her readers face not shocks <i>per se</i> but habit made visible through sheer exaggeration. Rhythms and repetitions are far more important in Stein than are pronouncements; her vision of literature is expressed more through a logic of duration than it is through such world-altering Poundian cries as "Make it new!" Stein's most outrageous claims tend not to gain power from the intensity of her conviction nor the purity of her expression, but rather from an intensifying effect&#x02014;a snowballing logic of repetition and amplification. Indeed, the concept of habit takes us through a set of highly diverse and seemingly incommensurable areas of the Steinian corpus, from sentences to theories, and from her most accessible works to her most experimental.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 

<p>
Stein drew important connections between her work and the cinema.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Like her fascination with what she calls "series production," this connection is at once formal and historical. On the one hand, she is responding to the stylistic similarities between 


<b></b>


her own literary innovations and the cinema's use of repetition, of accumulating photographic frames linked together to form a narrative. On the other hand, she is responding to the historical contexts in which she is creating these stylistic innovations. As she puts it in "Portraits and Repetition":

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I was doing what the cinema was doing, I was making a continuous succession of the statement of what that person was until I had not many things but one thing . . . I of course did not think of it in terms of the cinema, in fact I doubt whether at any time I had ever seen a cinema but, and I cannot repeat this too often any one is of one's period and this our period was undoubtedly the period of the cinema and series production. And each of us in our own way are bound to express what the world in which we are living is doing.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's manifest argument in this quotation is that history determines style, that "any one is of one's period," and that her work was thus of its moment, profoundly modern in the sense that "the cinema and series production" were modern. But we might also read her comment in the opposite direction. That is, her understanding of cinema is in some senses determined by her investment in a pragmatist discourse of habit, allowing her to see in the mechanized and repetitive forms of "cinema and series production" a metaphor for her own work and her own vision of habitual repetitions. Just as Benjamin's essay on Baudelaire contextualizes habit within the social settings of modernity, Stein's pragmatic modernism helps to reinvest the mechanized modern language of series production and repetition with the humanized, individuated energy of daily habits and behaviors.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 

<p>
At the same time, Stein's comments about the cinema capture her ability to insert herself into historical narratives&#x02014;literary, cultural, technological&#x02014;in order to fortify and reinscribe her own position as a public re and famous author. This adds another element&#x02014;one we might label "marketing" or indeed "publicity"&#x02014;which complicates Stein's relation to the cinema, and to mass culture more generally. Stein clearly and unsentimentally saw her work and her literary personality as commodities, and in 1936 she went so far as to write enthusiastically to Thornton Wilder about the possibility of making <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> into a Hollywood film:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
listen Thornton, couldn't they do the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas at Hollywood, that might make a lovely film, I do not know what makes lovely films but that might and they could shoot the background here and in Paris and we could be taken in Hollywood including the puppies Basket and Pepe and we would have enough money to make a leisurely trip across the continent and the Mississippi valley taking on a college boy for the more difficult driving and then we could have an installation in Washington Square and go to and fro for ever. Do you think there is anything in it, I am not just perfectly sure there isn't.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
What appears as Stein's characteristic faux-na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9; ("I do not know what makes lovely films but that might") in this passage can also be seen as a clever meditation on her own public image. Reasonably enough, Stein feels that a film would be a good source 


<b></b>


of income and that it would give her and Alice an excuse to return to the United States after her triumphant lecture tour of 1934-1935. At the same time, she seems to be suggesting that she and Alice (not to mention the dogs Basket and Pepe) would actually be the stars of the film. Further, she chooses to imagine that the making of this film would be an infinite process, allowing Stein to "have an installation in Washington Square and go to and fro for ever." The letter takes the mythology of Stein's private life&#x02014;her travels by automobile with Alice, their households at Bilignin and at Paris, their love for their dogs, and so forth&#x02014;and offers it as material for a film, making explicit her conviction that it constitutes an appropriate, even an ideal, subject of public interest.

<p>
The boundaries between the fictional world of this film and the creation of her own public identity and private life are so artfully blurred in this description as to suggest a real insight into Stein's conception of her life and public image. Indeed, though such a film was never made, the idea of the film is a resonant one for our understanding of Stein's self-creation as a public re. It is easy to imagine that Stein conceived of herself as though she were the star of an ongoing film. As is indicated by the pleasure she takes in imagining her own mythology in cinematic terms (in the idiom of modern commercial culture), her work and her thought were thoroughly permeated with moments of self-conscious salesmanship. This salesmanship functioned very much as a mode of mediation, a way of negotiating the relationship between her stylistic experiments and her historical moment. Such a self-conscious negotiation and manipulation of her work within her social context, furthermore, required a vastly sophisticated grasp of the complicated interrelationships between daily life, the marketplace, literary history, and literary and educational institutions. Habit also functioned for Stein as the key to these relationships.

<p>
Recent work on modernism has attempted to think across Huyssen's "great divide," and to bring modernism into contact with commercial culture in a variety of different ways.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Stein's deep understanding of and investment in commercial culture, her interest in self-promotion, and her sophisticated marketing skills have made her a prime candidate for just this sort of rereading. For Stein, there was no choice to be made between literary institutions and avant-garde proclamations&#x02014;the failure of the Surrealists as she describes it in <i>Paris France</i> is evidence of this very impossibility. It is a mistake to want "publicity not civilisation," but it is not a mistake to want publicity; the crucial failure is the failure to grasp the necessary and ongoing relation between the two. The recontextualizing stance exemplified by Stein demanded both an acceptance and a deep understanding of the ways in which literary institutions, national identities, and individual thoughts and actions were built upon long years of accrued habit. Stein's approach to publicity maintained a dialectical connection to "civilisation" that she felt the Surrealists had sacrificed too quickly.

<p>
The image of Stein as an impresario on her own behalf&#x02014;in public and in private&#x02014;is perhaps most succinctly captured in the imprint at the top of her 27 Rue de Fleurus stationery, which bore a tiny rose surrounded by circular typeface reading "rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  This stunningly resonant image functions precisely the way a trademark functions in legal terms, as a synecdoche for a product, a guarantee of quality, 


<b></b>


a form of consumer protection, but most importantly as a way of fostering "brand recognition."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Most striking about Stein's choice of phrases to represent her "brand name" is that as much as this choice is a form of self-creation, it relies as well on public constructions of her identity. The phrase "rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" was adopted very early on as a public shorthand for Stein's repetitions and obscurity of meaning, a sort of popular Zen koan meant to stand in for all of Stein's work. By enthusiastically acceding to the idea that this single phrase could somehow capture the complexity of her work, Stein intentionally plays on the public's existing image of her, embroidering and engraving it into her daily life and circulating it within her personal correspondence. Such a combination of "publicity" and "civilisation" demonstrates Stein's genius for self-promotion, her canny manipulation of simplification and repetition, and her deep respect for the powerful ripples sent out by private, daily life.

<p>
These ripples are strongly felt in <i>Paris France</i>, not only in Stein's discussions of the relation between publicity and civilization, but in her vision of national identities as constituted through and by the accretion of daily habits. Indeed, in <i>Paris France</i> "civilisation" is not only what she misses in the work of the Surrealists, it is also a shorthand for French culture, a culture Stein reveres for its ability to balance respect for the past with unperturbed adaptability in the face of modernity. As Stein puts it, "It is nice in France they adapt themselves to everything slowly they change completely but all the time they know that they are as they were" (<i>PF</i>, 16). 

<p>
"Civilisation" is composed of a complex amalgamation of minutiae (daily behaviors and habits) and generalities (national beliefs and ideologies), in combinations that sometimes appear intuitive and at other times are quite surprising. It is typical of Stein, for example, to find the essence of French identity in a place as distant from the clich&#x000E9;d shorthands of berets or the Marseillaise as can be imagined:

<blockquote class="extract">

But the thing that was most exciting were the knives and forks.

It may seem strange that a humble&#x02014;if acute and incisive&#x02014;knife and fork would be asked to stand in for the entirety of French civilization. It is precisely the banality of the objects, however, and the dailiness of their use that qualifies them to be, in Stein's words, "the most passionately french things I knew, I might say I ever knew." For Stein, the continual accumulation of daily experiences and habits creates a shared literary, philosophical, and national history that is evoked by the use and recollection of such objects as knives and forks.

<p>
More specifically, what makes these knives and forks so "passionately french" is the way they both represent history and bend to present circumstance. They had been "sharpened so much that the blade was as thin as a dagger," while at the same time they were "so light that when you pressed on them they bent." In other words, it is through the accumulation of a long and noble history of daily use that these knives and forks have acquired their flexibility, their adaptability. This combination of respect for

the past and flexibility about the future captures perfectly Stein's sense of French culture more generally. Her vision of national identity, and of history, depends upon her respect for the power and importance of daily repetitions and accumulations. She insists that habits can accrue a historical and a national weight even as they remain flexible to future needs. 

<p>
But Stein specifically credits French culture with understanding both the inevitability and the crucial importance of habits established over many long years. It is because of the power and command of habit in France&#x02014;because it is a culture that has an answer for every question, a solution to every problem, a technique for every undertaking&#x02014;that Stein sees it as "where the twentieth century was:"<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

As the final line of this passage indicates, <i>Paris France</i>'s interest in French civilization is an interest developed very much in the shadow of the two World Wars. Stein's discussions of civilization explicitly link questions of national identity to international politics. However, they also link national identity to publicity, to literary tradition and literary history, and to Stein's own role as a public re and famous author. When she claims that France formed the "background for the twentieth century," she means in part that it provided a background for her and her circle. In the lectures delivered during her lecture tour of 1934-1935, these links between daily life, national identity, and literary history are made explicit in order to foreground and explain the importance of her own work.

<p>
<i>Lectures in America</i>, the volume that resulted from this tour, is made up of lectures (including "The Gradual Making of the Making of Americans," "Portraits and Repetition," "Poetry and Grammar," and "What is English Literature") that attempt to systematize and rationalize the literary choices made by Stein over the course of her career, and to contextualize them more generally within literary history. At the same time, these lectures do more than merely organize past thoughts: they reintegrate her work into a new progressivist narrative, a narrative at once about Stein's literary success and about the development of an American national consciousness. By linking these two narratives of development, Stein establishes a coherent vision of literary history and national identity that is both constitutive of and foundational to her own public importance. She thus connects publicity and civilization, moving readers into the twentieth century by finding ways to contextualize the shock of modernity and avant-garde representational strategies within existing cultural traditions and literary institutions. She manages to publicize her own work, winning acclaim while presenting herself as an exemplary modern re, a model for others seeking to integrate the shocks of modern publicity, representation, and production into existing patterns of daily life and collective habit.


<b></b>


<p>
These lectures, and in particular "What is English Literature," offer an interesting comparison to <i>Paris France</i>. As in <i>Paris France</i>, the story Stein tells also implies a parallel story&#x02014;the story of her own work, her own innovations, her own moment. The lectures, however, want to trace a context for, as opposed to a backdrop to, Stein's literary contribution. While <i>Paris France</i> seeks to explain the setting in which "the twentieth century" found its home, her lectures explicitly posit an alternative version of literary history&#x02014;in this case <i>English</i> literary history. They then offer prophecies of the future of literature, prophecies that inevitably locate that future in America and embody it in the re of Stein. As she says near the beginning of the lecture, "What is English literature, by English literature I mean American literature too."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 

<p>
Stein opens "What is English Literature" with what appears to be a tautology: "One cannot come back too often to the question what is knowledge and to the answer knowledge is what one knows" ("WIEL," 11). The rest of the essay will bear out the opening claim. Stein believes, literally, that "one cannot come back too often," or that repetition has a power and a value that this piece (like most of her work) will exemplify. Of course it is never mere mindless repetition she advocates, but rather iterations in the Derridean sense, whose nuances (and insistences) shift with their contexts and accumulate a range of meanings over time. The second paragraph, for instance, offers the title question of the essay&#x02014;not as a mere repetition but as an already-expanded, subtly modified, and ever-shifting amplification of the question:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
What is English literature that is to say what do I know about it, that is to say what is it. What is English literature, by English literature I mean American literature too. 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

</div>


<p class="noIndent">
Typically, Stein's gestures of clarification ("That is to say," "by English literature I mean . . . ") do as much to obscure or expand as they do to clarify or limit her question. Traditional logic is replaced by an internal logic of accumulation: English literature is "what . . . I know about it," and this is English literature. When she appears to be on the verge of offering a definition of "English literature," she veers into another area entirely: "by English literature I mean American literature too." This addition is a significant one for Stein's new genealogy of literary history, which, at the turning point of the twentieth century, leaps across the ocean from England to America. 

<p>
The logic of the essay is perhaps made most explicit in the following paragraph:



<blockquote class="extract">

Leaving aside the tantalizingly provocative claim that the history of English literature "could be told in a couple of sentences," this moment marries the stylistic features of the piece to Stein's larger arguments about national identity and literary history. For while Stein argues for English literature as a coherent, continuous narrative built over time through accumulated habits of daily behavior and civilization and culminating in her own work, the piece also argues, explicitly and through its formal structure, for the 


<b></b>


power and the importance of repetition, amplification, accumulation, duration&#x02014;for the necessity of making things "a great deal longer."

<p>
While "What is English Literature" links textual, syntactic, and rhetorical repetitions to literary history through its formal structures, its argument also takes up the question of how daily repetitions contribute to a national history. As Stein relates the history of the development of literature in England, she also importantly defines British culture as an island culture.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The island is a particularly notable image for Stein, representing a site where a single culture progresses based on its own habits of daily living. The insularity of "island living" is thus evocative of a continuity with past habits as well as an inaccessibility to other ways of life. 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The thing that has made the glory of English literature is description simple concentrated description not of what happened nor what is thought or what is dreamed but what exists and so makes the life the island life the daily island life. It is natural that an island life should be that. What could interest an island as much as the daily the completely daily island life. And in the descriptions the daily, the hourly descriptions of this island life as it exists and it does exist it does really exist English literature has gone on and on from Chaucer until now.

In the single paragraph from which this passage is quoted, Stein uses the word "description" four times, the word "daily" four times, the word "island" seven times, and the word "life" eight times. The effect is the recreation of the "daily island life" in which repeated actions accumulate to form the behaviors, preferences, and tendencies of a culture. That "description" res prominently in her vision of "daily island life" is significant as well, because it demonstrates the extent to which Stein sees writing as at once a daily practice, like making the bed or brushing your teeth, and as a mode through which the author participates discursively in the creation and the maintenance of a national culture.

<p>
In the story of development traced out by "What is English Literature," "daily island living," or living by the habits of the past, comes to be replaced by something new, represented by "American literature" and more particularly by Stein herself: 

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
In England the daily island life was the daily life and it was solidly that daily life and they generally always simply relied on it. They relied on it so completely that they did not describe it they just had it and told it. Just like that. And then they had poetry, because everything was shut in there with them and these things birds beasts woods flowers, roses, violets and fishes were all there and as they were all there just telling that they were all there made poetry for any one. And there was a great deal of poetry for some five hundred years or more and there is a great deal of it. All this now has been everything.

<p class="blockquote">

In America as I was saying the daily everything was not the daily living and generally speaking there was not a daily everything. They do not live every day. And as they do not live every day they do not have the daily living and so they do not have this as something that they are telling.

This vision of America as a land without habit also partakes of a very recognizable mythology: America as a land unmoored from history and thus as more genuinely 


<b></b>


capable of recreating itself each day in the fresher air of the New World. Critics from Cornel West to Richard Poirier have celebrated what they see as the "Emersonian" and "pragmatic" elements of this view.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 

<p>
But the narrative of progress put forward here, what appears to be Stein's dismissal of "daily island living" as incapable of producing the literature of the twentieth century, should be read against competing claims elsewhere in her work. It should be read, for instance, against her claim in the <i>Autobiography</i> that "if you are way ahead with your head you naturally are old fashioned and regular in your daily life" (<i>AABT</i>, 75). Even the idea that the narrative of literary progress should end in America can be thrown into question with these final lines of the <i>Autobiography</i>: "About six weeks ago Gertrude Stein said, it does not look to me as if you were ever going to write that autobiography. You know what I am going to do, I am going to write it for you. I am going to write it as simply as Defoe did the autobiography of Robinson Crusoe. And she has and this is it." (<i>AABT</i>, 237)

<p>
This evocation of Crusoe, who had to recreate life anew on his island, to forge new habits taken from the past but shaped and molded to the new context in which he found himself, is at once a powerful tribute to habits of the past (including those represented by British literary history), and a celebration of those who are willing to create new habits and thus new ways of living in the present. Writing to Stein in 1936, Thornton Wilder offered the following enthusiastic adoption of Stein's most recent principles:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Oh, dear Gertrude, how right you are. Without tears I say it human nature is not interesting only Robinson Crusoe is interesting.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
"Human nature" here can be taken to mean mindless, habitual behaviors.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Robinson Crusoe, on the other hand, can be taken to represent a commitment to creating new habits better suited to a new world. It is thus the reinvention&#x02014;and not the rejection&#x02014;of "daily island living" that enables Stein to claim a position from which she can create the literature of the twentieth century. If the "daily island life" indicates a world in which "everything was shut in there with them," it is not much of a leap to imagine the lesbian m&#x000E9;nage of Toklas and Stein as one possibility for a newly responsive and modern recreation of "daily island living" with a difference&#x02014;a new set of habits, created in Dewey's words to be "more intelligent, more sensitively percipient, more informed with foresight, more aware of what they are about, more direct and sincere, more flexibly responsive than those now current" (<i>HNC</i>, 128). 

<p>
In creating&#x02014;and publicizing&#x02014;a "daily island life" of her own even as she develops a theory of "daily island living" and its links to literary history, Stein produces a vision of both national and individual identity linked to literary identity, one that is formed through daily exercises in writing, the rhythms of solitary work, and the public literary identity that comes from selling and justifying one's work in the marketplace. Instead of attempting to isolate either the purely textual movements of Stein's writings or the purely social discourses she produces, I want to argue that Stein's pragmatic modernism


<b></b>


makes it difficult to think one without the other. Her vision of social identities&#x02014;national, literary, sexual, class-based, and so forth&#x02014;inevitably takes shape through literary habits on the page and in practice, while her literary habits are always shaped by meditations on their place and effect within national and international public contexts.

Stein's work demonstrates the same complicated and dialectical treatment of habit that can be seen in James's and Dewey's philosophical examinations. Though she does not allow herself the conceptual escape-hatch of the oppositional stance, Stein remains profoundly aware of habit's mindless, deadening qualities. Indeed, her sophisticated understanding of the workings of habit renders her ambivalence towards its power all the more profound. As in James and Dewey, daily habits in Stein's work carry both conservative and transformative resonances, echoes of the past and visions of future actions. This ambivalence echoes throughout Stein's work, from <i>The Autobiography</i> to the following passage from "Poetry and Grammar":

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one's own interest and I do decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing. A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's description of commas in this passage recalls Dewey's description of "habit alone," which leads to "machine-like repetition, duplicating recurrence of old acts" (<i>HNC</i>, 126). Like habit, commas are a way of "replacing one's own interest," and the implications of their use are hardly negligible, for they "keep you from living your life as actively as you should lead it." While the passage offers an implicit treatment of philosophical or political habits of thought, it also uses metaphors of domestic life to signal the mindlessness and invisibility of grammatical habits. The rhythms of daily life and the daily practice of writing are placed in explicit relation, in this case by the transformation of the text into a sort of domestic environment.

<p>
Central to this textual/domestic habitat is the image of everyday household toil, an image reinforced by Stein's choice of the word "servile" to describe commas at the start of the passage. This scornful relegation of the comma to the role of the wife&#x02014;who, by "helping you along" helps "you" to ignore the daily functioning of your home so that you can consider weightier matters&#x02014;recalls Stein's alternating scorn and regard for the "daily island life" that enables truly creative work<i>.</i><sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> Toklas, banished to the boring and thankless task of entertaining Fernande Picasso almost from the start of <i>The Autobiography</i>, is also implicitly credited throughout that work, and throughout Stein's work more generally, with enabling Stein's genius. Stein's claim in <i>The Autobiography</i> that "if you are way ahead with your head you naturally are old fashioned 


<b></b>


and regular in your daily life" (<i>AABT</i>, 75) should be taken seriously. Stein is equally serious, however, when she associates being "old fashioned and regular in your daily life" with grammatical crutches like commas, literary ruts, and worst of all, with mindless habits of thought. This dialectical movement illuminates the paradox of habit described by Dewey and James.

<p>
Reading through this dialectic makes it clear that "living your life as actively as you should lead it" does not mean rejecting daily habits, as the historical avant-garde might have suggested. On the contrary, it means embracing those habits in a newly mindful way. Furthermore, Stein's discussion does not gesture toward a space free from habitual crutches. Indeed, the passage itself employs three commas, thus implying that, like habit, commas may be degrading, but they are also necessary to the forward movement of a text (as, by extension, habits are necessary to the smooth functioning of a home, or to the stability and power of a culture). Stein thus captures the ongoing tension between habitual behavior and thought as both enabling and deadening, as something to be warmly embraced but also vigorously resisted. 

<p>
In <i>Paris France</i>, habit represents at once the reassuring continuation of the past and the radical innovation of the future. The text traces Stein's ever-changing emphasis from the conservative to the transformative implications of habit. The question of habit is never resolved: it is both the necessary precondition for literary and political innovation and their potential downfall. The credo of <i>Paris France,</i> "Paris France is peaceful and exciting," itself embodies the conflict at the center of pragmatist habit. For Stein as for Dewey, awakening from habit is an ongoing process involving a sometimes painful fluctuation between habit itself (which is "peaceful") and shocks to habit (which are "exciting"). Further, the repetition of the phrase "Paris France is peaceful and exciting" performs a kind of rehabituation of the reader, who experiences the impermeability of Steinian "nonsense" even as she is invited into the Steinian logic of the text. As she moves through the book, the reader is habituated into a new set of reading practices, brought from alienation and estrangement to new habits of thought. In other words, the line embodies its own content, in the sense that the reader simultaneously experiences the "peaceful" lull of repetition and the "exciting" or invigorating work of avant-garde literary experiment. Taken together, this interplay between the "peaceful" and the "exciting" captures the very essence of the recontextualizing mode.

<p>
Daily repetitions and cultural traditions are important in the context of <i>Paris France</i> not just for their own sake, but because they create an environment in which innovations can take place:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
So it begins to be reasonable that the twentieth century whose mechanics, whose crimes, whose standardisation began in America, needed the background of Paris, the place where tradition was so firm that they could look modern without being different, and where their acceptance of reality is so great that they could let any one have the emotion of unreality. 


<b></b>

<div class="attribution">

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>


<p class="noIndent">
Movements of the future require a solid ground of "firm tradition" from which to launch their transformations. According to Stein, "anything one does every day is important and imposing" (<i>PF</i>, 18), precisely because it enables something beyond itself. In this case, the importance of Paris is that it enables "the emotion of unreality"&#x02014;the imagination of an unrealized (and possibly radical) future&#x02014;imported, along with "the twentieth century," from America. As in "What is English Literature," "America" is posited not only as the opposite of "tradition," but as the very wellspring of the twentieth century in the form of "mechanics" and "standardisation," terms that recall Stein's description of the cinema and "series production" in "Portraits and Repetition." 

<p>
But the complicating term in this passage is "crimes," hidden suggestively between "mechanics" and "standardisation." The word seems to suggest that "mechanics" and "standardisation" may be harbingers of the future, but they do not necessarily represent a triumphant overcoming of the civilization of the past:

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
And so the French having invented nineteenth century warfare and then lost it, it was completed by the Americans in the civil war, they developed and fixed it as a thing definite and complete and the 1914-1918 war was as one might say just the end of the series.

<p class="noIndent">
War as a form of "series production," or, more appropriately, "series destruction," is thus presented as one of America's contributions to the development of the "twentieth century." The suggestion that the Civil War offered a model for war as a newly standardized and mechanized activity calls up harrowing images of conveyor-belt casualties and deaths not far from the historical truth of the American Civil War and the war Stein claims is its legacy, World War I. With "crimes" included in her vision of "the twentieth century," modernity appears here as an ethically compromised development, hardly the radical future that breaks free from the stultifying past. Even the accompanying "standardisation" and "mechanisation" are thrown into a new light, and suddenly modernity signals habit's destructive consequences while the "firm tradition" of France offers an affirmative, "civilising" influence. Habit is everywhere in this description: neither savior nor villain, it enables and destroys in equal measure. Just as daily domestic habits are linked to national culture and "civilisation," the newly modernized habits of series production, standardization, and mechanization are linked to military conquest, national expansion, and the changing relation of Europe to America in the twentieth century. 

<p>
Recent criticisms of pragmatism tend to emphasize its limitations in accounting for the weight of the past, and, indeed, some contemporary incarnations of pragmatism call for a turn away from past and present political failures or divisions on the cultural left and towards a less "resentful" approach to the political present.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Stein's pragmatic modernism offers a different approach to the relation between past and future. As deployed by Stein, the pragmatist concept of habit not only respects the weight and power of the past, but actively demonstrates the dangers of ignoring that past. It shows that mindlessness is an equal danger in all habitual modes of thought, including those that orient themselves towards some imagined future. This delicate balance of pragmatist


<b></b>


habit, continually juggling respect for constructive habits of the past with skepticism for any and all mindless practices, reaches into every sphere. It suggests the relationship of mutual interdependence between the domestic and the national and insists that the "weightier matters" of philosophical thought and literary experimentation flourish in the rich soil of daily life.

<p>
Stein's complicated approach to the habits of "daily island living" can be felt throughout <i>Paris France</i>, where the civilization of France and the innovations of the twentieth century are only useful and interesting when juxtaposed. The title <i>Paris France</i> embodies the centrality of this sort of juxtaposition within the text, acting as the crowning example of the "peaceful and exciting" dialectic explored throughout the book. Though the phrase may appear at first as a clich&#x000E9;, or as a synecdoche for a known quantity, it comes alive with the opposing energies of past and future, of habit and modernity, of Paris and France. Paris, signifying a site of international cosmopolitan sophistication, takes on a newly modern charge in relation to France, a nation-state with a history stretching backwards into the past. What further enables this dialectical push and pull is the elimination of the "servile" comma that works against active and fully contradictory living. Free of the comma, the phrase opens itself up to a dialectic of habit which also functions as a Benjaminian engagement with history. As in the Baudelaire essay, "modernity" in <i>Paris France</i> is meaningless as a concept abstracted from historical conflict and specificity. To understand "the twentieth century," Stein might say, it is necessary to understand the deep and variegated strata of habits that have brought us to our moment. 

<p>
Stein's pragmatic modernism should be valued for what previous discussions of modernism have too often disdained: for its commitment to managing and redirecting the energies of historically specific shock, its awareness of its own institutional embeddedness, and its skepticism about the inherent usefulness of violent disruptions of convention. To study the tradition of pragmatic modernism, as illustrated by the work of Stein, is to put modernism into its social and institutional contexts. While Stein's work does not share Benjamin's explicit commitment to leftist social transformation, it joins with Benjamin to suggest the possibility of an alternative model of critique, one that can also be recognized in the work of novelists like Henry James or Marcel Proust, or of such thinkers as William James, John Dewey, and Oliver Wendell Holmes. As developed by Stein, habit offers an unrooted, antiessentialist dialectic whose oscillations require neither undue empirical confidence nor metaphysical teleology and whose implications for social and literary criticism are thus all the more potent. Stein's work offers us a glimpse of an alternative tradition in modernism, and it points the way toward a new possibility within contemporary academic discourse: that of the recontextualizing mode of criticism.

Connections between pragmatism and Bergsonism have often been invited by the biographical fact that James and Bergson met several times, shared a correspondence, and read each other's work with great sympathy and interest. Ralph Barton Perry devotes several chapters to the relationship in his <i>The Thought and Character of William James</i> (Boston: Little, Brown, 1935). Priscilla Wald also briefly mentions this relationship, in connection, interestingly, with Bergson's influence on Stein. See Wald, <i>Constituting Americans</i> (Chapel Hill: Duke University Press, 1995), 295-7.

Reading Stein through pragmatist habit also helps to break down common dichotomies in the categorizations of Stein's work, such as the division between her "accessible" and "experimental" styles. It is in this vein that I focus primarily on <i>PF</i> in this article. With the important exception of a recently published essay by John Whittier-Ferguson, "The Liberation of Gertrude Stein: War and Writing," ( 8.3 [2001]: 405-28) surprisingly few critics have offered sustained readings of <i>Paris France</i>. Those who do so often use the text as though it were a transparent memoir. Shari Benstock, for example, uses <i>PF</i> as an informational "source" in her <i>Women of the Left Bank</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986). Equally surprising are reports of the book being shelved in the "travel" section of bookstores. Putting this text in the context of pragmatic modernism will, I hope, reveal not only its textual experimentalism and richness but its continuity with Stein's more commonly revered "Master-Pieces."

Stein criticism over the years has made much of this topic, most frequently in order to argue in favor of Stein's interest in the disjunctive, the extra-linguistic, or the technological. See Wendy Steiner's introduction to <i>Lectures in America</i> (1935; rpt. Boston: Virago, 1988), and Susan McCabe, "'Delight in Dislocation': The Cinematic Modernism of Stein, Chaplin, and Man Ray,"  8.3 : 429-53.

It is in the context of her discussion of cinema that Stein famously makes the distinction between "repetition" and "insistence," in a highly amusing defense of her most commonly parodied and misunderstood textual innovation: "Then also there is the important question of repetition and is there any such thing. Is there repetition or is there insistence. I am inclined to believe that there is no such thing as repetition. And really how can there be . . . every time one of the hundreds of times a newspaper man makes fun of my writing and of my repetition he always has the same theme, always having the same theme, that is, if you like, repetition, that is if you like the repeating that is the same thing, but once started expressing this thing, expressing any thing there can be no repetition because the essence of that expression is insistence, and if you insist you must each time use emphasis and if you use emphasis it is not possible while anybody is alive that they should use exactly the same emphasis.

And so let us think seriously of the difference between repetition and insistence." (Stein, "Portraits and Repetition," 166-7.)

The editors of the <i>Collected Letters of Gertrude Stein and Thornton Wilder</i> offer the following elaboration on the rose logo: "In <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, Stein writes, 'Speaking of the device of rose is a rose is a rose is a rose, it was I who found it in one of Gertrude Stein's manuscripts and insisted upon putting it as a device on the letter paper, on the table linen and anywhere that she would permit that I would put it. I am very pleased with myself for having done so' . The line makes its first appearance in 'Sacred Emily.' The poem, a portrait of Madame Matisse, was written in 1913 and published in December 1922 in <i>Geography and Plays.</i> " (Burns and Dydo, <i>The Letters of Gertrude Stein and Thornton Wilder</i>, 128).

This is not the only place she refers to "island cultures." Perhaps most memorably, in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,</i> she argues with Bertrand Russell over the difference between Greek and Latin cultures, claiming the distinction lies in whether or not they are "island cultures" (<i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, in <i>Selected Writings of Gertrude Stein</i>, ed. Carl Van Vechten [New York: Vintage, 1990], 75. Henceforth abbreviated as <i>AABT</i>).

Stein's most important extended discussion of "human nature" and its adverse, "the human mind," takes place, appropriately enough, in <i>The Geographical History of America or The Relation of Human Nature to the Human Mind</i> (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973). Critics have read this discussion as concerning a wide variety of philosophical problems; in addition, they have read <i>The Geographical History of America</i> as "the central text in any consideration of Stein's relations to American literary tradition" (Marianne DeKoven, "Half in and Half Out of Doors: Gertrude Stein and Literary Tradition," in <i>A Gertrude Stein Companion</i>, ed. Bruce Kellner [Westport, CT: 1988], 75). Most readings of the text connect "human nature" and "the human mind" to abstract philosophical concepts such as "identity" and "self." DeKoven links the terms to an Emersonian tradition, arguing that "a great deal of the book is in fact a serious, sustained idealist meditation on the difference between transcendence, or the human mind, and immanence, or human nature" . I prefer to read "human nature" as ingrained and thoughtless behaviors or social habits, and "the human mind" as Dewey's "conscious search," signaling a variety of possibilities, from literary and intellectual history to the critical stance of pragmatic questioning. This reading offers an understanding of 


<b></b>


the relation of human nature to the human mind that grounds such abstract philosophical issues as "transcendence," "immanence," and "master-pieces" within the dialectic of habit.

Stein's disdain for the servile commas also recalls the dominant mythology of Stein's relations with Alice B. Toklas, and interestingly suggests the daily habits that characterized the "daily island living" of the Stein/Toklas m&#x000E9;nage. Catharine Stimpson has claimed that "the marriage was Victorian," pointing out that "(n)ot only did Stein write, and Toklas type and edit, but Stein ate, and Toklas cooked and served" (Catharine R. Stimpson, "Gertrice/Altrude: Stein, Toklas, and the Paradox of the Happy Marriage," in <i>Mothering the Mind</i>, eds. Ruth Perry and Martine Watson Brownley [New York: Holmes and Meier, 1984], 130). Toklas's hyper-traditional wifely role was emphasized time and again by both Stein and Toklas and is central to <i>AABT</i>, in which Stein has Toklas introduce herself as follows: "I am a pretty good housekeeper and a pretty good gardener and a pretty good needlewoman and a pretty good secretary and a pretty good editor and a pretty good vet for dogs and I have to do them all at once and I found it difficult to add being a pretty good author." (<i>AABT</i>, 237) Even the famous Stein/Toklas Saturday evening salons were divided neatly by "gender roles;" Stein sat with the "geniuses," and Toklas sat with "the wives of geniuses": "Before I decided to write this book my twenty-five years with Gertrude Stein, I had often said that I would write, The wives of geniuses I have sat with. I have sat with so many. I have sat with wives who were not wives, with geniuses who were real geniuses. I have sat with real wives of geniuses who were not real geniuses. I have sat with wives of geniuses, of near geniuses, of would be geniuses, in short I have sat very often and very long with many wives and wives of many geniuses" (<i>AABT</i>, 13).
