There were, as nearly everybody knows by now, two

Kurt Weills . . . . The first Weill, it has been

said, wrote "authentic" works with a claim on the

art music world; the second "sold out" for popular

success.

<p>
In September 1942, Kurt Weill reported to Lotte Lenya on his
six-hour
meeting
with Marlene Dietrich, during which he had tried to persuade
her to play
the
title role in <I>One Touch of Venus: </I>"Marlene liked the
music, but
started
that old business about the different quality of my music
here in America.
I cut
it short by saying, 'Never mind those old German songs. --We're in
America now and Broadway is tougher than the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm.'
That stopped her."
<sup><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
But it hasn't stopped others. In the
subsequent
five decades, that familiar theme, the "different quality"
of Weill's
American
music, has become evermore an evergreen, subject to
countless variations,
most of
which have deftly shifted accentuation from <I>"different
</I>quality" to
"different <I>quality." </I>Meanwhile, posthumous
professional productions
of
Weill's American stage works have been infrequent and access
to them at
best only
partial (through vocal scores and recordings) and at worst
entirely
misrepresentative (through film adaptations). The perceived
stylistic and
qualitative differences between Weill's American and
European
music--already "old
business" in 1942--have become so pronounced that today it
is commonplace
to
speak of "two Weills." 

<B></B>

<p>
This critical construct has even been institutionalized in
<I>The New Grove
Dictionary of Music and Musicians, </I>where the final
section of David
Drew's
Weill entry is actually entitled "The Two Weills." Drew
asserts that
"while some
notable artists have simply stopped creating at a certain
stage in their
careers
and a few have put an end to their lives, Weill is perhaps
the only one to
have
done away with his old creative self in order to make way
for a new one .
. . .
With <I>Lady in the Dark </I>a new Weill was born, to the
horror of the
handful
of old admirers who were waiting for an American
<I>Dreigroschenoper.</I>"
<sup><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Drew infers the genuine composer's
suicide from the circumstantial evidence of an alleged sea
change in the
music
Weill composed in America. "This has nothing to do with
normal evolutionary
processes," he explained in 1969. "It is . . . a
psychological and indeed
historical phenomenon for which there is no parallel in
music. It means
that in
Weill we have not one, but two composers. The first and
important one can
and
should be evaluated without reference to the second."
<sup><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Today such an opinion cannot be dismissed out of hand as
merely
Eurocentric, for
the "two-Weill" conceit was, in fact, coined in America amid
shadows cast
by the
critical response of French-connected musical modernists to
<I>Lady in the
Dark</I>'s triumphant premiere in January 1941. Weill's
erstwhile admirer
Virgil
Thomson, who five years earlier had claimed in <I>Modern
Music </I>that
"Weill
has almost created style," lamented in the <I>New York
Herald Tribune
</I>that
the &eacute;migr&eacute; composer's effort to master a
distinctively
American and
populist Broadway idiom had failed: "All is monotonous,
heavy, ponderously
German. It reminds one of Berlinese jazz from the early
1920s, of revues
called
'Die Schokoladen Kiddies,' of sentimental ditties called
'Ein kleiner
Slow-Fox
mit Mary.' . . . His music is just as banal as before; but
its banality
expresses
nothing."
<sup><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Samuel L. M. Barlow, whom Thomson had recommended
to the
editorial staff of <I>Modern Music, </I>echoed Thomson's
views and
invoked, for
possibly the first time, the notion of a "true Weill" in
contrast to the
one who
had composed <I>Lady in the Dark: </I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In this long score, there are not three minutes of the true
Weill. And in
this
new medium, this new life, this new success, the promise has
been buried
under a
branch of expensive but imitation laurel. This is sad, and
no joking
matter.
Something first-rate has gone third-rate, which is a loss
for everyone who
cares
deeply for an art, beyond any prejudice or timeliness or
mode."
<sup><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Shortly before Weill's death, the distinguished New York
drama critic
Harold
Clurman, one of the founders of the Group Theatre, provided
a
retrospective of
the composer's American career:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Weill's career since <I>Johnny Johnson, </I>despite
excellent work now and
again--always on a high level of craftsmanship--has been an
adaptation
toward an
increasingly facile, I might say, artistically nondescript
goal. The
result has
been--not unnaturally--an ever more conventional musicality,
a decline in
real
quality, and an increase in journalistic praise, as well as
box office
receipts .
. . . There is nothing wrong in adapting oneself to 

<B></B>

 a new
environment, but
one
must adapt oneself upward rather than downward, that is, to
the more
challenging
and difficult as well as to the simpler and safer.
<sup><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
A year later, in a review of a memorial concert for Weill in
Town Hall,
Virgil
Thomson agreed that the aesthetic shift differentiating the
two Weills had
indeed
coincided with the biographical dislocation at the midpoint
of his career
and
succinctly formulated the indictment: "After Weill came to
live in
America, he
ceased to work as a modernist."
<sup><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
As musicology now begins to take the historical measure of
various strains
of
high modernism and deconstruct its mythology, Weill emerges
as a key
re.
<sup><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Although in the introductory statement to the first
<I>Ferienkurse f&uuml;r internationale neue Musik </I>in
Darmstadt in 1946
Weill
was one of the ten composers mentioned by name for European
post-War
reclamation
(curiously Webern and Berg were not), sustainable interest
in his
post-1933 music
did not outlive him there. Weill himself had well recognized
the
precarious state
of his post-war reputation in Germany and did not
underestimate the
cultural
barriers that would prevent a fair hearing of his American
works. In 1949,
for
example, he discouraged the notion of a German production of
<I>One Touch
of
Venus, </I>his Broadway piece most closely resembling
conventional musical
comedy: "From all I know about the present status of the
German theatres my
impression is that they are in no way equipped to do justice
to a piece
like
<I>Venus, </I>and a bad production would do a lot of harm to
me. My
European
reputation is worth more to me than the very negligible
amount of money I
can
make with this production."
<sup><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Weill's misgivings were
confirmed by
Berlin theater critic Friedrich Luft, who marvelled at
Weill's and Lerner's
"vaudeville" <I>Love Life, </I>the "most beautiful and most
powerful
evening of
theater" he had encountered in New York in 1949: "Such a
combination of
music,
lighting, dance, and wit could hardly be produced with such
nonchalant
precision
by us at home, today or in the foreseeable future."
<sup><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
But those European critics who could know Weill's American
work only by
reputation, popular arrangements of individual songs, or
grossly disred
screen adaptations of his stage works, tended to concur with
Otto
Klemperer's
assessment: "Weill's last pieces I find awful."
<sup><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
The
vehemence with
which Weill's American work was repudiated in the post-War
European musical
environment is indicative less of its intrinsic value than
of the
challenge it
seemed to pose to prevailing canons and hierarchies.
<sup><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
For
example,
in the opening line of his obituary of Weill, T. W. Adorno
suggested that
"the
profile of this composer, who died in America, can hardly be
encompassed
by the
concept of a composer at all." Thereby, Adorno implied that
Weill's
individual
works, his total output, and his compositional evolution
lacked the organic
unity, stylistic progression, and internal consistency
expected of a
genuine
composer.
<sup><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
Adorno, of course, had long been a, if not <I>the, </I>key
re in
Weill-reception, at least in Central Europe. A virtuoso
display of
dialectical
gymnastics had initially allowed him to defend <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper,
</I>and
consequently Brecht and Weill, 

<B></B>

 from
that work's popular
success. Squeezed
into an
almost unmaneuverable space between an idiosyncratic Marxist
world view
and his
modernist dictum that "all good music since 1850 has
renounced
commercialism
altogether," Adorno declared <I>Dreigroschenoper</I>'s
popularity to have
been a
misunderstanding. The music's parodistic surface is so
appealing, he
noted, that
"those who don't observe sharply enough might think it's all
fun" rather
than a
negative example, a warning against "the demonic abyss of
inanity."
<sup><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Although themselves assembled from "the debris of old,
atrophied material,"
<I>Dreigroschenoper </I>and <I>Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt
Mahagonny
</I>brilliantly exposed the folly, in Adorno's view, of
attempting to
revive dead
(read tonal) music. But Weill was unwilling to follow the
implicit agenda
that
Adorno was thus setting out for him under the label
"surrealism."
<sup><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
After writing an enthusiastic essay about the Berlin
production of the
<I>Mahagonny </I>opera at the Theater am
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, Adorno
predictably
reneged on his commitment to review <I>Der Jasager </I>and
<I>Die
B&uuml;rgschaft, </I>whose path led away from the parts of
<I>Mahagonny
</I>that
had attracted him. Erstwhile praise for the composer he had
constructed was
becoming something of an embarrassment. Weill had left
Brecht behind, and,
with
him, what had been the basis for Adorno's defense. Further
comment would
require
disavowal, as Weill had renounced the values Adorno
considered to be
absolute:
subjective expression's exclusive claim to authenticity, the
historical
necessity
of atonality, and the existence of objective, integral laws
of musical
structure.
In contrast, long before he would arrive in America, Weill
claimed that the
European tradition of autonomous art music had reached its
appointed
historical
end and was thus doomed to extinction.
<sup><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
In his works composed
after
1925, Weill had tried to break out of New Music's splendid
isolation, to
attract
a non-specialist audience, to dismantle the barricades that
the
"art-for-art's-sake" wing of modernism had erected against
mass culture. He
suggested that an art work must arise from some sort of
social
consciousness.

<p>
By 1940 Adorno and Weill were both in New York. They had
very little, if
any,
direct social or professional contact.
<sup><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
As Weill was composing
<I>Lady in the Dark, </I>Adorno was writing his Schoenberg
study,
"Schoenberg and
Progress," later to be published as part of his
<I>Philosophie der neuen
Musik
</I>(philosophy of modern music).
<sup><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Therein Adorno insists
that "even
the loneliest language of the artist" communicates by
renouncing
communication,
and that this lonely discourse "reveals more about social
tendencies than
does
communicative discourse." In an interview the same year,
Weill
categorically
rejected <I>"Einsamkeit" </I>(loneliness) and once again
affirmed his
commitment
to accessibility over autonomy: "I do not feel that I
compromise my
integrity as
a musician by working for the theater, the radio, the motion
pictures or
any
other medium which can reach the public which wants to
listen to my
music."
<sup><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
After Adorno moved to Los Angeles in 1941, he corresponded
with Weill only
once,
at Brecht's instigation, concerning a proposed all-Black
production of
<I>The
Threepenny Opera.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<I> </I>Adorno returned to Frankfurt in
1949,
and the occasion of his next public statement on Weill was
the obituary,
which,
although it evinces no firsthand 

<B></B>

knowledge of Weill's stage
works after
<I>Lady
in the Dark, </I>nevertheless dismisses them all as
concessions to the
American
culture industry: "He had tried to write grand opera. The
most pretentious
was
<I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft. </I>But he no doubt realized the
inadequacy of
that."
Then, modelling himself on Cole Porter, "Weill yielded,"
Adorno claimed,
"to the
pressures and enticements of exile, without fully counting
the cost." But
critic
and Schoenberg-biographer H. H. Stuckenschmidt soon did and
tallied the
balance
sheet: Weill's success in America "was dearly bought by loss
of
quality."
<sup><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
"Success" is almost an id&eacute;e fixe within the two-Weill
debate, and
it has
already become something of a leitmotif in this discussion.
Although most
modernist critics have tended to date Weill's purported
"sellout" for
popular
success as roughly coinciding with his arrival in America,
his search for
a wider
audience in commercial venues had begun in Berlin. Already
in the cultural
setting of 1928, success and <I>Amerikanismus</I>--and in
Siegfried
Kracauer's
formulation, also "mass ornaments" and <I>neue Sachlichkeit
</I>(new
matter-of-factness)--were widely seen to be linked: "The
content of
Americanism
reaches its peak not in cultural values but in the idea of
success. Work
only
rarely means something for its own sake to Americans . . .
while pure
creativity
in all forms not immediately concerned with success assumes
the status of a
social wallflower."
<sup><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
After the worldwide success of <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper, </I>even Hans Heinsheimer, representing
Weill's
publisher,
Universal Edition, expressed concern over Weill's most
recent
"commercialized
artistic activity," the score for Brecht's and Elisabeth
Hauptmann's slight
<I>Amerikanismus-St&uuml;ck, Happy End: </I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
You should and must free yourself once and for all from
Berlin's
commercialized
artistic activity now that the success of your recent works
has given you
complete independence and freedom, not only financially, but
also
artistically. .
. . You must once again create works which can truly endure,
works which
aren't
just created for the moment as accompaniment for plays, but
which follow
the
great path of development I have always perceived in all
your
works.

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Two decades later, having just seen Weill's and Maxwell
Anderson's
anti-apartheid
"musical tragedy" <I>Lost in the Stars, New York Times
</I>music critic
Olin
Downes wrote to the composer to express opinions similar to
Heinsheimer's:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In many respects I think <I>Lost in the Stars </I>is the
best thing you
have done
yet for the theater . . . . But I am still waiting for the
day when you get
exactly the subject which you can treat without the faintest
consideration
of
public taste or expediency of any sort, while in the
meantime you are
constantly
developing a reputation for making it more and more possible
for you to do
exactly what you want to do ultimately.
<sup><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In attempting to persuade Weill to abandon the more
"accessible" path and
turn
back onto a "higher," albeit more difficult road, without
regard for an
audience,
both Heinsheimer and Downes seemed unable to perceive or
accept the central
thread linking the two halves of Weill's career. The
composer's responses
to each
of them, 

<B></B>

 though formulated in different
languages and under
drastically
different
circumstances, are remarkably alike in content and even
diction. Weill
wrote to
Heinsheimer:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The fact that my <I>Dreigroschenoper </I>music has been
commercialized
doesn't
speak against it, but for it, and we would be falling back
into our old
mistakes
if we were to deny some music its importance and artistic
value simply
because it
found its way to the masses . . . . I am the only creative
musician who
for years
has worked consistently and uncompromisingly in the face of
opposition
from the
snobs and aesthetes toward the creation of fundamental forms
of a new,
simple,
popular musical theater. Even my least significant music
theater works
during
this time have been written with this sense of
responsibility and have
grown out
of a constant effort to further a development which seems to
me the only
one
possible. Is that commercialized artistic activity?
<sup><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
And to Downes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It must be somewhat surprising indeed to find a serious
subject treated in
a form
which (in this country at least) has been used so far only
for a lighter
form of
entertainment. But that was exactly the nature of my
experiment--to do a
"musical
tragedy" for the American theater so that the typical
American audience
(not a
specialized audience) can accept it, and the real success of
the piece to
me is
the fact that the audience did accept it without hesitation,
that they
accepted a
lot of very serious, tragic, quite un-Broadway-ish music of
operatic
dimensions,
together with some songs written in a more familiar style.
Personally I
don't
feel that this represents a compromise.
<sup><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Weill's expulsion from Germany and subsequent emigration
certainly
complicated
the issue of "success," for theories of assimilation or
resistance in
exile are
closely intertwined with certain aesthetic precepts of
modernism. In
Adorno's
words, "every intellectual in emigration is, without
exception, mutilated
and
does well to acknowledge it to himself, if he wishes to
avoid being cruelly
apprised of it behind the tightly closed doors of his
self-esteem."
<sup><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
As might be expected, Weill felt just the opposite. In 1949,
he wrote (in
English) to one of his old friends in Germany:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
My success here (which people usually ascribe to "luck") is
mostly due to
the
fact that I took a very positive and constructive attitude
towards the
American
way of life and the cultural possibilities in this country
of which most
of the
German intellectuals who came here at the same time, were
critical and
doubtful.
I found enormous latent possibilities in my special field,
the musical
theatre .
. . . Of the ten theatre pieces I've written since I came
here, about half
were
successes, the other half failures.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Success of the collaborative venture of Broadway musical
theater entailed
high
stakes and was unambiguously defined: if a musical play
failed to find an
audience, it disappeared, sometimes after only a single
performance. And
after a
flop in New York, rarely was there the possibility of a
second chance for
revision and restaging that Rossini and Verdi had taken for
granted, or
even
<I>Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny </I>had eventually
managed. The
intertwined processes of creation and production 

<B></B>

 of American
musical
theater
blurred the boundaries between "work" and "event,"
composition and
performance,
with out-of-town previews serving as a lower-stakes
opportunity for the
collaborators to proof the pudding and refine its recipe
before a paying
audience, which on Broadway would function as final arbiter,
an
all-powerful,
democratically constituted collective critic. Predictably
Adorno
considered such
an approach to the creative process a capitulation to
cultural
commercialism:
"Popularity is psychologically calculated down to the last
note for its
effect on
the listener."
<sup><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Weill disagreed; "It wouldn't be so much fun
if it
weren't so dangerous, so unpredictable," he told Lenya. "It
is safer to
work in
the movies. But how dull, how uninspiring!"
<sup><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Whereas "the
enormous
amounts of money involved" in radio, television, and film
forced the
"creative
artist to adapt himself to the requirements of that
industry," in the
theater
"investments are smaller so one is much freer."
<sup><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
The 1930s were a grim decade for the Broadway musical, and
not just
because of
the Great Depression. Competing with radio and movie
musicals that had
lured away
many of its creative teams and performers, the stage musical
was searching
for
both new form and function. To envision Broadway in 1936 as
"a perfect
place to
develop a musical theater which, in time, will become to
[America] what
opera was
to Europe" required considerable imagination, especially
after the
financial
failure of <I>Porgy and Bess, </I>Weill's misleading
initiation to the
American
musical theater.
<sup><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
In an essay published in 1937, Weill
appended "in
America" to a title--"The Future of Opera,"--that Schoenberg
had used a
decade
earlier (and Busoni two decades previous), and set out an
ambitious agenda
for a
"music theater which would develop on a new plane fixed by
the conditions
in the
United States." Whereas Schoenberg had insisted that "art
and success have
to
part company," Weill critiqued the moribund European
operatic tradition
that had
lost its way with "an almost diseased passion for musical
originality."
<sup><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
He asserted that "it would be much healthier
for an
American musical theater to make certain concessions to
Broadway
showmanship than
to cater to a traditional opera form which is European in
concept and
purpose."
<sup><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Adorno scoffed at what he considered to be self-deception:
"Weill talked
as if
concession to the commercial field were no concession, but
only a pure
test of
'skill' which made everything possible even within
standardized
boundaries." Yet,
the substance and manner of Weill's Broadway works (with one
or two
exceptions,
perhaps) virtually guaranteed that they would not be the box
office
successes of
his competitors. As Stephen Hinton has observed, "Weill's
American
works--each
breaking new ground, each laying claim to the status <I>sui
generis</I>--are no
less <I>Urformen </I>than the European."
<sup><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Weill's emigration
had
unexpectedly given him the freedom to explore new hybrid
forms of musical
theater
which the state-subsidized theatrical system in Germany had
largely failed
to
accommodate. The composer described his own <I>Linie
</I>from 1927 to
1947, from
the <I>Songspiel Mahagonny </I>through <I>Street Scene,
</I>as continuous,
a
striving toward "a special brand of musical theater" ("CT").

<p>
Most critics, however, have disagreed. Ernst Krenek, in his
essay
"America's
Influence On Its Emigre Composers," included Weill among
those colleagues
who
took "great pains, against their better judgment, to
cultivate modes of
writing
conditioned 

<B></B>

 by their surroundings" and
"whose American works
point up new
characteristics unknown to their earlier works." Weill, with
his
"irrepressible
urge to communicate via the musical theater," Krenek
observed, "adapted
this
communication to the only vehicle at his disposal, namely
the Broadway
stage."
<sup><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Adorno was less empathetic: "He could no longer do
what he
knew how to do. He had to renounce all those elements in his
musical
language
which once had created a Weillian atmosphere."
<sup><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Decades
later, even
the composer's staunchest champion positioned one Weill at
the greatest
possible
distance from the other: "In all principles--of composition,
of direction,
of
character--everything Weill wrote in America is
fundamentally different
from the
way that was Weill's in Europe."

<p>
But is it? By what criteria? Aesthetic, technical,
sociological,
dramaturgical,
or ideological? This represents the central question in
Weill scholarship
today,
and it impinges upon many wider issues about the nature,
function, and
reception
of music in the twentieth century. In addressing it, we are
immediately
thrust
into an ongoing postmodern debate where contextualists and
relativists
battle
against culture-specific assumptions, which have long
purported themselves
to be
universals. If, as Weill consistently maintained in private
and public,
all his
works were stepping stones along the same path toward an
accessible modern
musical theater, that accessibility demanded that he take
into account his
audience, his "reader." "Being a theatrical composer," he
believed, "I
have to
present my music in a manner which would be accepted by a
realistic
public."
<sup><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Therefore, as his public changed, from Berlin to
Paris to
London to New York, his manner would also have to change. It
is in this
sense
that Harold Clurman's description of Weill as a musical
Gulliver,
"characteristically twentieth-century" in his adaptability,
gains meaning:
"He
could write music in any country so that it would seem as if
he were a
native. If
he had landed among the Hottentots, he would have become the
outstanding
Hottentot composer of the Hottentot theater. Weill was all
theater and all
'mask.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
If, in Weill's case, style is defined as neither
"idea"
nor <I>the </I>immutable essence that encodes its composer's
identity, but
as
<I>a </I>manner in which he chooses to communicate a
particular musical
thought,
then his style indeed changed. But not once, in America, but
rather, again
and
again. That this stylistic diversity does not follow a
linear biographical
progression becomes obvious in a sample of works composed
almost
simultaneously
in France in 1933-34: the second symphony, the biblical
spectacle <I>Der
Weg der
Verheissung, </I>the satirical operetta <I>Der Kuhhandel,
</I>the
quintessentially French incidental score for <I>Marie
galante, </I>as well
as
cabaret songs for Marlene Dietrich and chansons for Lys
Gauty. The variety
here--of composition, direction, character--would seem to
exceed that
between
<I>Die Dreigroschenoper </I>and <I>Love Life </I>or between
<I>Der
Silbersee
</I>and <I>Street Scene. </I>

<p>
Rather than attempting to sort and classify Weill's various
stylistic
masks as
either "European" or "American" in origin and design, it may
be instructive
instead to identify 

<B></B>

 those features
which remained invariable
throughout his
career. "I need poetry to set my imagination in motion, for
my imagination
is not
a bird but an airplane," Weill had admitted to his sister in
1919, the
year he
determined "that his special field of activity would be the
theater."
<sup><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Thirty years later he proudly observed:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
One of the first decisions I made was to get the leading
dramatists of my
time
interested in the problems of the musical theater . . . .
The list of my
collaborators reads like a good selection of contemporary
playwrights from
different countries.
<sup><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In private, however, he continually lamented how big a role
he always had
to play
in writing a libretto and how difficult it was to find a
qualified
librettist. In
New York, Weill avoided working with the practitioners of
formulaic musical
comedy; his distinguished list of near-collaborators
included such unlikely
librettists as John Steinbeck, Thornton Wilder, Herman Wouk,
William
Saroyan, and
Tennessee Williams. And the failure of Weill's and Brecht's
attempt to
renew
their partnership in the mid-forties for musical versions of
<I>Schweyk
</I>and
<I>Sezuan </I>must be imputed largely to Brecht's refusal to
deal with the
realities of the American producing system rather than any
artistic or
political
reticence on Weill's part. When Weill joined the Playwrights
Producing
Company so
that "things [could be] handled with more courage and
imagination"
<sup><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
than could be expected from most commercial producers, he
found little
altered
from the modus operandi of the Brecht or Piscator
collectives in Berlin,
except,
as Weill told Adorno, that "there exist certain rules of
'fair play' in the
American Theatre."
<sup><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>

<p>
Weill's working methods were at odds with the Broadway norm
in other ways,
as
well. For example, his collaboration with Ira Gershwin was
initially
problematic,
because Ira was accustomed to fitting lyrics to George's
preexistent
tunes, the
usual procedure for popular songwriting teams. Weill, on the
other hand,
found it
virtually impossible to compose without a text in hand. As a
compromise,
at first
they worked in the same room, creating text and music almost
simultaneously;
later Gershwin would give Weill a quatrain to set before
writing the
remainder of
the lyric. Weill also insisted on orchestrating the bulk of
his own
Broadway
music, something few others after Victor Herbert have
attempted, either
because
they lacked the requisite expertise or the production
schedule imposed
deadlines
that could be met without heroic efforts only by a team of
orchestrators
and
copyists. Willingly turning over to specialists just a very
few "hot" jazz
or
dance numbers with which he was uncomfortable, Weill often
wrote full
score as he
watched rehearsals and stayed up all night during tryouts to
accommodate
new
material and changes. Because orchestration was such a key
stage in his
compositional process, he risked his health rather than
compromise this
dimension
of his artistic vision. He sought dispensation from union
rules and
agreements
specifying a minimum number of players in order to outfit
each Broadway
work with
its own characteristic orchestral palette and texture.
Therefore, the ad
hoc
mixed ensembles of his American works seldom conformed to
the standard
twenty-odd
piece Broadway pit orchestra of the forties. <I>Street
Scene</I> 

<B></B>

 used the
largest
orchestra, approximately thirty-five; <I>Lost in the Stars,
</I>the
smallest,
only twelve. He considered the latter the most ingenious
orchestral effort
of his
career, and a detailed study of Weill's Broadway
orchestrations would
reveal
subtlety and skill unsurpassed in any of his European
scores. But to date
none of
his American theater works has been published in orchestral
score, and
they have
seldom been heard. Only two have been recorded in their
entirety; and
Weill's
instrumentation rarely survived in the well-known pop song
versions and
film
adaptations of his stage works.

<p>
Weill finished no independent instrumental compositions in
America. After
the
opening of <I>Lady in the Dark, </I>he reported to Ira
Gershwin, "I've
written
some orchester [sic] music, but I threw it away. It seems so
silly just to
write
music at a time like this."
<sup><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
His attitude was consistent with
his
lifelong desire to write "committed" music that would have
demonstrable
impact on
the culture and society for which it was intended. To
appreciate the
historical
and sociological context for his work, one must recall that
the African
American
lyricist of <I>Street Scene, </I>Langston Hughes, was not
permitted to
stay in
the same hotel as the rest of the company in Philadelphia,
and the tour of
<I>Lost in the Stars </I>was cancelled for the same reason
of enforced
racial
segregation. If Adorno had experienced Weill's American
scores as
performed in
their original Broadway productions, he would not have found
the music
"hard to
distinguish from Cole Porter."
<sup><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Rather he would have
encountered
(and surely recognized) familiar Weillian elements:
melodies, harmonic
procedures, formal structures, text-music relationships,
tonal
language--even
movements taken over intact from the European works. The
most obvious
carryovers,
of course, were literal self-borrowings, often resurrecting
material from
pieces
unlikely to be resuscitated as a whole. Something from
<I>Der Kuhhandel
</I>,<I> </I>for example, turns up in virtually every
score prior to
<I>Street Scene </I>(including both <I>Lady in the Dark
</I>and <I>One
Touch of
Venus</I>).
<sup><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
A memorable contrafactum from a tenor aria in
<I>Der
Kuhhandel </I>accompanied Maxwell Anderson's lyric "Oh, it's
a long, long
way
from May to September" in <I>Knickerbocker Holiday
</I> and thus was
transformed into Weill's most famous American song. Some
"Salvation Army
material" from <I>Happy End </I> was interpolated into
<I>Johnny
Johnson</I>  and <I>One Touch of Venus</I> ,
without any tinge
of
exoticism. Finding the war music of <I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft
</I> in
the
"Divorce Ballet" of <I>Love Life</I> , however, is
more surprising.

<p>
Sometimes literal quotation of earlier material was
motivated by textual
correspondence. For example, in the <I>Ballad of Magna
Carta</I> ,
as King
John strikes down the Seneschal with his mailed fist, Weill
composed music
virtually identical to the end of the boxing scene in Act II
of
<I>Aufstieg und
Fall der Stadt Mahagonny </I>,<I> </I>when Joe sinks
to the ground
and
Fatty calls it a knockout. By far the lengthiest
self-borrowing is the
instrumental introduction ("Nocturne") to Act II of
<I>Street Scene,
</I>lifted
with only slight modification from the "Nachtszene" of
Weill's incidental
music
for Piscator's 1928 production of Leo Lania's
<I>Konjunktur.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
What is significant about passages such as these is <I>not
</I>that Weill
has
reused music from his European works; self-borrowing, only
rarely intended
to be
heard as allusive, had 

<B></B>

 long red in
his compositional
process: <I>Die
sieben
Tods&uuml;nden </I>appropriated portions of <I>Der
Silbersee, </I>for
example,
and the Second Symphony borrowed material from both <I>Die
B&uuml;rgschaft
</I>and <I>Silbersee. </I>Rather, it is that these passages
could be taken
over
with little or no alteration without seeming "foreign" or
borrowed. They
seldom
needed translation in their new contexts.

<p>
Such occurrences, however, remain only superficial echoes of
specific
passages
from Weill's European music. More telling are deeper
resonances within his
musical language: the treatment of strophic and
verse-refrain structures
(cf.,
for example, the form and function of the 16-measure,
strophic "Moritat vom
Mackie Messer" and "The Saga of Jenny"); characteristically
"Weillian"
harmonic
progressions (cf. the refrain of "Das sch&ouml;ne Kind"
[1917] and the
climax of
Maurrant's Aria from <I>Street Scene </I>[1947]); the
unfolding of
large-scale
double-tonic structural units with explicit non-triadic
cadential
resolutions
(cf. Sonata for Cello and Piano [1920] and "My Ship" from
<I>Lady in the
Dark
</I>[1940]); fifth-generated harmonies and pentatonic
melodies (cf. Mvt.
IV of
<I>Frauentanz </I>[1923] and "What Good Would the Moon Be?"
from<I> Street
Scene</I>); and ubiquitous semitone vacillations between
major and minor
within
melodic and harmonic structures. While such examples put the
lie to
Adorno's
assertion that in America Weill "could no longer do what he
knew how to
do,"
generalizations of any sort are inadequate with respect to
Weill, European
or
American. Unmasking one work reveals little about the
stylistic identity of
another. Each aspires to its own manner and form: in Weill's
words, "each
show of
this type has to create its own style. its own texture, its
own
relationship
between text and music."
<sup><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
Thus, even contiguous pieces such as
<I>Street Scene, Down in the Valley, </I>and <I>Love Life
</I>differ from
each
other as fundamentally in "composition, direction, and
character" as they
do from
any European predecessors in Weill's oeuvre.
<sup><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<p>
For a number of reasons, <I>Street Scene </I>may be the most
compelling
case
study for testing the two-Weill hypothesis.
<sup><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
As he was
composing it,
Weill told his brother Hans that "it is without doubt the
most important
piece
I've written since <I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft, </I>and it might
turn out to be
the
best of all my works."
<sup><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
Shortly before his death, Weill
affirmed that
appraisal and prophesied that "Seventy-five years from now,
<I>Street Scene
</I>will be remembered as my major work."
<sup><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
It represented, he
said,
the culmination of two dreams: 1. the dream of "a special
brand of musical
theater that would completely integrate drama and music,
spoken word, song
and
movement," toward which all his previous works had aspired;
2. the dream
of an
American opera on Broadway.
<sup><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Thus, if Weill privately
acknowledged
any split in his musical personality, in <I>Street Scene
</I>the two
personas met
and merged again. As a self-consciously American
opera--written <I>about
</I>America, intended <I>for </I>America, idiomatically
<I>of
</I>America--there
is no Broadway score of Weill's, before or after, that seems
to David Drew
"so
remote from his European experience."
<sup><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
And during the first
three
decades after Weill's death, <I>Street Scene </I>was
virtually the only
Broadway
work 

<B></B>

 by Weill to be produced in
recognizable form in Europe
and thus impact
directly upon the "two-Weill" debate there. Thirty-five
years after its
European
premiere in D&uuml;sseldorf in 1955, release of the first
two complete
recordings
of the opera and subsequent productions in Bielefeld and
Munich--as well
as an
influential co-production with the Houston Grand Opera in
1994 by the
Theater im
Pfalzbau in Ludwigshafen and the Theater des Westens in
Berlin--have
rekindled
the controversy that now seems to center on <I>Street Scene
</I>rather than
<I>Lady in the Dark.</I>

<p>
Weill said that he had first experienced Elmer Rice's 1929
Pultizer
Prize-winning
play <I>Street Scene </I>when it was produced as <I>Die
Stra&szlig;e </I>in
Berlin in 1930.
<sup><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
He met the playwright in New York during
rehearsals
of <I>Johnny Johnson </I>in 1936 and told him that "he had
thought of it
many
times as a perfect vehicle for a musical play" ("SP"). But
Rice, having
been
approached by a number of other composers, including Deems
Taylor and
William
Schuman, thought it was too early for such a musical
adaptation. After the
end of
the war in 1945, however, it again seemed feasible to
consider producing a
play
about the urban American melting pot, in which outsiders
strove to be
insiders.
<sup><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Weill and Maxwell Anderson had already started
work on an
outline of a musical version, when Rice insisted that he
would have to
adapt the
play himself. He did agree to bring in a poet to write the
lyrics, which
were to
have none of what Weill called the slickness of typical
Broadway lyrics,
but
rather would "attempt to lift the everyday language of the
people into a
simple,
unsophisticated poetry" ("SP"). After submitting several
audition drafts,
one of
the leading poets of the Harlem Renaissance, Langston
Hughes, landed the
commission, even though he had never worked in the musical
theater before.
The
subsequent collaboration only barely accommodated the team's
conflicting
agendas.
Rice resisted changes to his veristic play, so that after a
year of work
what
emerged was far closer to <I>Literaturoper </I>than Weill
had originally
hoped.
The first number Weill is known to have composed in January
1946 was,
appropriately, "Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?"
<sup><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Rice later described <I>Street Scene </I>as the "most
experimental" play
he ever
attempted, in that the apparent classical unities of time
and place were
overwhelmed by a "multitude of varied and seemingly
irrelevant incidents,"
which
somehow had to be arranged into "a patterned mosaic" whose
construction
would
depend upon "concealed architectonics." Rice recalled:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I was helped by concert-going, as well as picture-gazing. No
musician, I
yet had
some grasp of the structure of symphonic music: the
statement,
restatement, and
development of themes . . . . I had been strongly influenced
by the work
of the
17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain, in most of whose
pictures
there was a
dominant architectural unit; . . . in the foreground were
groups of
res, seen
always in relation to the pervasive structure . . . . I was
excited by the
concept of a large number of diverse individuals whose
behavior and
relationships
were largely conditioned by their accidental common
occupancy of a looming
architectural pile. In keeping with this plastic approach, I
thought of
calling
the play "Landscape with res."

Thus the apartment
building,
modelled on an actual one on West 65th Street, served as a
microcosmic

pot, in which working class characters of diverse ethnic and

experienced, within a single twenty-four-hour period, birth,

Rice's naturalistic drama now seems a most unlikely source
for a libretto.
Despite Weill's <I>post facto </I>insistence that it was a
"perfect
vehicle for
the sort of popular opera" he wanted to write, he wrote to
his parents
that "it
was the riskiest project" 

<B></B>

 he'd yet
undertaken.
<sup><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
Although
foreign to
the naturalism of the play, traditional operatic discourse
could certainly
articulate the principal characters's aspirations, dashed
hopes, and
unfulfilled
dreams. But finding a musical analogue for the "urban
landscape with
res"
represented by the house, the "musicodramatic agent" that
Weill described
as "a
prison for the human spirit," presented more of a challenge:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
As soon as I began to think about the music for <I>Street
Scene </I>I
discovered
that the play lent itself to a great variety of music, just
as the streets
of New
York themselves embrace the music of many lands and many
people. I had an
opportunity to use different forms of musical expression,
from popular
songs to
operatic arias and ensembles, music of mood and dramatic
music, music of
young
love, music of passion and death.

<p>
Thus Weill was inspired to invent an equivalent for the
Melting Pot: he
planned
to precede Sam's arietta, "Lonely House," with a huge
five-section
scene-complex
entitled "A Nation of Nations," which would serve as the
central metaphor
for the
opera's pluralistic subject matter and manner. He instructed
Hughes:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
The Melting Pot scene we have worked out somewhat on the
following line: it
should start out with a very funny description of Columbus's
trip by Lippo,
always at the end of stanza interrupted by Olsen's dry
remark "But
Erickson was
first." Then we'll have a number of rather short songs of
the different
nationalities, built on a refrain "if it weren't for the
Irish (Germans,
Negros,
etc.), where would America be?" This would lead into a short
t. Then we
decided, Sam should come in and should give them the Melting
Pot idea, and
this
leads into a big ensemble.

Sam, the shy Jewish intellectual, with palpable
autobiographical resonance
for
both Rice and Weill, would seem, in comparison, an isolated
re, the
genuine
outsider of the play. Standing on the street in front of the
house, Sam
would
then sing a "blues," what Weill called the "theme song" of
the show.
("Funny, you
can be so lonely with all these folks around," the first
verse of its
refrain,
ironically corresponds to Adorno's definition of
Expressionist
"Einsamkeit": "the
loneliness of city dwellers who are totally unaware of each
other.")
<sup><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
Eventually the entire "Melting Pot" ensemble had to
be
dropped because of its length (it survives in an incomplete
twenty-page
piano
draft), but the relationship it bore to Sam's arietta was
extrapolated to
all of
Act I. (See <a href=2.1kowalke_2.html> 2</a> for the
Musical Design of <I>Street
Scene.</I>)

<p>
The musical design of Act I corresponds to what Rice called
the "patterned
mosaic" structure of the original play and is also
suggestive of the
res
foregrounded in Lorrain's landscapes.
<sup><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
The private drama of
the
Maurrant family is set in relief against a broader musical
backdrop of the
community living in Number 346. After the introductory unit
of the first
four
numbers, successive "I am . . ." musical monologues by each
of the four
principal
characters in the Maurrant drama (Anna, Frank, Sam, and
Rose) alternate
with
pieces of the collective facade, presented by an ensemble
populated by
people
with different dialects and ethnic backgrounds: the "Gossip
Quartet," the
"Ice
Cream Sextet," "Wrapped in a Ribbon," "Wouldn't You 

<B></B>

 [<a name="2" href="2.1kowalke_2.html">re
2</a>] <b>[Begin Page 42]</B>

 Like to Be On
Broadway," and
"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed." In the space of these nine
numbers, the
audience is
confronted with two full-blown arias, a parody of a
nineteenth-century
Italian
opera ensemble, a gloss on the Gossip Trio in d'Albert's
<I>Tiefland,
</I>a charm
song <I>&agrave; la </I>Rodgers and Hammerstein, a seductive
soft-shoe, a
jitterbug, a blues, and a slow fox torch song. Note,
however, that the only
musical numbers to receive overtly operatic generic labels
(arias for the
elder
Maurrants, cavatina and arietta for Rose and Sam) are sung
by the four
principals, and minor mode is reserved almost exclusively
for their use.

<p>
The centripetal force of so many diverse idioms packed into
less than an
hour
might threaten musical coherence, had Weill not counteracted
this stylistic
plurality with an analogue for the symphonic technique Rice
had utilized
to hold
his text together, by which words and images (especially
celestial ones
relating
the moon, stars, and dreams) recur, interact, and evolve
when presented by
various characters at different points in the drama. Despite
its
collage-like
surface, there is no score of Weill more tightly interwoven
motivically and
thematically than <I>Street Scene; </I>this is especially
remarkable given
how
much material from his original conception was ultimately
deleted. He uses
all
manner and scale of musical repetition, development, and
transformation to
unify
seemingly un-unifiable elements: reprise of large sections
of numbers;
refrains
within musical scenes; motivic generation and thematic
reminiscence,
transformation, and development. The resulting integration
of diverse
idioms and
sources within a single distinctive voice and coherent
musical structure
was
virtually unique in the Broadway musical theater of Weill's
time. Many of
the
associative relationships are too subtle and complex to be
diagrammed, but
some
of the most significant large-scale thematic correspondences
are indicated
in a
primitive chart on the right side of <a
href=2.1kowalke_2.html> 2</a>.
(Note also that
the opera
begins and
ends in <I>D</I>, with the minor mode of that key recurring
at key tragic
moments
of the drama.)
<sup><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
The cumulative effect of such highly
self-referential construction draws the audience into the
scene and rivets
attention on the domestic drama unfolding within the house.

<p>
Some instances are entirely traditional in technique and
function: a
four-measure
orchestral reprise of "Lonely House" closes Act I to
recapitulate the
central
theme of the drama as Sam is left alone on stage, dwarfed by
the building;
the
orchestra plays the melody associated with Mrs. Maurrant's
words "Somehow
I never
could believe" at the climax of the Choral Lament as she is
carried off on
a
stretcher, never to regain consciousness; the reprise at the
end of the
opera of
the opening number "Ain't It Awful, the Heat" brings the
drama full circle
to
emphasize the ultimate futility of individual human
endeavor; with
characteristic
Weillian irony in the final two-bar cadence of the work the
orchestra
blares the
principal melodic re associated with Mr. Maurrant's "Let
Things Be
Like They
Always Was." The densest web of associative material occurs
in the
underscoring,
which Weill uses not only to reinforce the illusion of
naturalism by
mediating
between what is spoken and what is sung, but also to comment
on the stage
action,
usually from an omniscient authorial point of view--a
familiar technique
in film,
which it in turn had appropriated from opera and operetta.
<sup><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></sup> 

<B></B>

<p>
"The results are something like <I>Carmen," </I>Weill said.
"The entire
musical
score thus becomes a form of storytelling."
<sup><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
The impetus
toward
"narrativizing" orchestral discourse is apparent at the very
outset of the
opera:
in the verse section of Number 10 "Lonely House" a static,
chromatic
ostinato
re is repeated nineteen times in the bass line; its
laconic surface is
agitated by a secco vertical presentation of a minor second.
When Weill
later
composed the Introduction to Act I, he started the opera
with the first
four
measures of the refrain from "Lonely House," brutally scored
and
symmetrically
harmonized for maximum distortion. Then, over a pentatonic
ostinato
invoking a
cinematic clich&eacute; for a bustling metropolis, the minor
second unfolds
linearly, before stretto entries by the violas and cellos
double the
motion of
the "molto agitato." Thus what Weill called the "theme song"
of the opera
also
generated the principal musical material of its
introduction. Both
elements of
that opening are then recalled at the moment of greatest
tension
immediately
preceding the double murder in Act II.

<p>
Clues to the function or meaning of such<I> intra</I>textual
references are
encoded entirely within <I>Street Scene. </I>But what Weill
termed the
"great
variety of musical idioms" in the score was not intended to
work merely on
a
"phenomenal" level as the vernacular music one might hear
"on a hot summer
evening in New York" ("SP"). (He and Hughes had spent
several evenings
observing
children at play so that the Children's Game at the opening
of Act II
would sound
authentic, and he used an actual school song of the Julia
Richman School
to lead
into "Wrapped in a Ribbon.") Rather, with <I>Street
Scene</I>'s collage of
styles
Weill has constructed a matrix of<I> inter-</I>textual
allusions, as large
and
complex as the<I> intra</I>textual one. They invite
associations with
specific
works, musical idioms, or stylistic conventions external to
<I>Street Scene
</I>and thereby force the audience to pull back from the
proscenium into a
larger
world.

<p>
Weill was thus still doing what he knew how to do:
defamiliarizing the
conventional, distancing musical content from function,
estranging music
from its
text, allowing well-known musical icons to become
particularized within the
unfolding drama at hand. As he had formulated it in 1933,
"Everyone who
knows
something about me knows that a text is merely a starting
point for
me--that
every text I've composed looks entirely different once it's
been filtered
through
my music."
<sup><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
At its most blatant, Weill paraphrases the "fate
motive"
from <I>Carmen, </I>as well as the melody associated with
the words "I
Pagliacci," at appropriate points in the stage action,
thereby
foreshadowing the
inevitability of the tragic outcome of the love triangle in
<I>Street Scene
</I>and aligning his everyday characters with their grander
operatic
predecessors. And what Adorno had admired in <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper,
</I>refunctioning old conventions by "transferring the
'estranging effect'
into
the musical realm" ("VA"), is also characteristic of
sections of <I>Street
Scene.
</I>The parodic references to the <I>Rigoletto </I>Quartet
and the
<I>Lucia di
Lammermoor </I>Sextet in <I>Street Scene</I>'s "Ice Cream
Sextet" recall
the
technique of the Handelian Third Dreigroschenfinale. In
furnishing Hughes
with a
blueprint for Nurses' Lullaby in Act II, Weill allows us a
glimpse into the
workshop where its "Brechtian irony" was crafted: 

<B></B>

Whatever we will do with the last scene, I am sure the
nursemaids will be
in, and
they need badly an amusing song. As you remember, it should
be a sort of
waltz
song about the newspaper reports and pictures, using the
whole Daily News
terminology which is typical of fifty million women in
America who are more
interested in murder stories than anything else. If you want
to, the
number could
also talk about their Park Avenue employers, maybe they
could indicate
their wish
that a murder like this should happen to their mistresses.
This part
should be a
regular little waltz chorus, then it would be interrupted by
a little
ditty in a
different rhythm (short lines) where they are scolding the
babies in the
carriages to be quiet . . . I know that this kind of lyric
which should be
gay
and funny and bitter at the same time is not easy to write
and that's why
I am
anxious for you to get started so that we won't get into
trouble.

<p>
Whereas epic <I>Verfremdung </I>had relied almost
exclusively on parody and
irony, fifteen years later Weill had at his disposal a
number of different,
sometimes more subtle, metadramatic devices for aesthetic
distancing.
<sup><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
Precisely because of this subtlety, however,
<I>Street
Scene</I>'s audiences<I> </I>were even more likely than
<I>Die
Dreigroschenoper</I>'s to mistake its surface for its
substance. Invited
rather
than required to adopt a critical stance, the "strong
reader" was
challenged to
decode the musical text while others in the audience could
simply enjoy it
without bother. In many cases Weill's intentions remained
ambiguous,
concealed
behind his proverbial theatrical mask. Intertextual
references could be
recognized and interpreted only if the listener were
equipped to
differentiate
them from the conventional backgrounds from which they
emerged. In this
sense,
the original title I had envisioned for this essay,
<I>"&Ouml;ffentlichkeit als
Stil: </I>Musical Experiences of a European Composer in
America," and the
music
of <I>Street Scene </I>(and most of Weill's other American
works,
especially
<I>Love Life</I>) are comparable: "readers" must apprehend
their
intertextuality
if they wish to place the particular within a larger
universe. To be
understood
fully, my abandoned title would have required not only
familiarity with two
languages but recognition of the titles and content of the
two essays by
Adorno
being troped: <I>"Einsamkeit als Stil" (</I>loneliness as
style), a key
section
from "Schoenberg and Progress," and "Scientific Experiences
of a European
Scholar
in America," Adorno's retrospective on his own years of
"exile" in the
United
States. The incongruities between the title and subtitle
prevent the astute
reader from mistaking Adorno himself for the "European
Composer in
America" whose
stylistic credo was accessibility.

<p>
Those referents would have been as foreign to <I>Street
Scene</I>'s
American
"readership" as many of <I>Street Scene</I>'s were to Adorno
and most of
the
European audience. While he could never have taken at face
value the
treakly
operetta idiom parodied in Polly and Macheath's "Liebeslied"
in <I>Die
Dreigroschenoper, </I>only someone more familiar with the
traditions and
repertory of the American musical theater might be expected
to see
something
standing behind the polyanna sentimentality of "We'll Go
Away Together" or
"Wrapped in a Ribbon." With these pointed allusions to two
generations of
American operetta--Romberg/Kern and Hammerstein and Rodgers
and Hammerstein
respectively--Weill manages both to relish and to critique,
while locating
<I>Street Scene </I>within a larger theatrical environment
and its
inhabitants
within 

<B></B>

 a wider sociological landscape.
In the end, however, meaning of such
intertextuality--even multiple layers of meaning--depends
less on attempts
to
fathom the composer's intentions than on the spectator's
independent
interrogation and interpretation of an often ambiguous text.

<p>
That the most "conventional" and seductive music in
<I>Street Scene</I> is
reserved for its shallowest, least mature characters is
discernible from
the
Musical Design outlined in <a
href=2.1kowalke_2.html> 2</a>.
The items marked by
asterisks are the
only
musical numbers that utilize one of the two standard forms
of American
popular
songs, with the 32-bar refrain or chorus generally
comprising four 8-bar
phrases
in either AABA or ABAB patterns. There are five such songs
in a row in Act
I,
Numbers 9-13, four of which are sung naively or impetuously
by youthful
characters, the fifth seductively by Harry Easter, <I>Street
Scene</I>'s
counterpart to<I> Porgy and Bess</I>'s Sportin' Life. The
two popular song
forms
in Act II, Numbers 18 and 20, frame the great choral lament,
and thus
serve a
double function. The extent to which each of these seven
numbers departs
from or
distorts the 32-bar conventional form indicates the degree
of independence
and
spontaneity of thought expressed by the character who is
singing.

<a name=3 href=2.1kowalke_3.html>
<img align=right hspace=5 height=125

Of the seven, the most conventional in form and content is
"Moon-Faced,
Starry-Eyed," but it invites the closest reading. It first
appears at the
end of
the orchestral introduction to Act I, immediately preceding
"Ain't It
Awful, the
Heat," itself an allusion to "Summertime" in <I>Porgy and
Bess. </I>Just
as that
work's overture had originally dovetailed into Jazzbo
Brown's on-stage
piano
solo, in <I>Street Scene </I>the orchestra drops out two
bars after the
curtain
goes up, leaving an on-stage radio playing a bebop
arrangement of the
first part
of "Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed." Obviously to be interpreted as
an actual
popular
song of the day, it simultaneously fixes the time period of
the opera as
the
forties (as opposed to the original play's twenties) and
draws the
audience into
the setting prior to the first rhythmically spoken lines of
dialogue, when
the
orchestra once again enters and takes control. Seventy-five
minutes later,
the
recklessly youthful Mae Jones and her date Dick McGann each
sing, in the
penultimate number of Act I, a full 32-bar chorus of the
song, interrupted
by
melodrama, i.e. diaglogue with musical underscoring,
particular to their
own
immediate situation. Here "Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed" is
presented as a
popular
song they both know, thereby allowing the audience to
suspend disbelief as
the
characters break into virtuoso jitterbugging which seldom
fails to bring
down the
house (<a href=2.1kowalke_3.html> 3</a>). The lyrics
of the song convert into the
most inane
clich&eacute;s the celestial imagery that had previously
conveyed central
characters's personal visions of the American dream.
<sup><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
Taken at
face
value, the number would indeed have placed Weill in the hit
parade down
Tin Pan
Alley with the popular tunesmiths and jitterbuggers who
symbolized for
Adorno
everything that was mindless and sick about American
culture. But the
musical
moment demands to be "defamiliarized," without assistance
from so blatant a
distancing device as Jack O'Brien provides in <I>Mahagonny
</I>by
proclaiming the
"Maiden's Prayer" to be "die ewige Kunst" (eternal art).

<p>
To make sure that the audience for <I>Street Scene
</I>understood the most
important intertextual reference in the opera, the inside
front and back
covers
of the souvenir 

<B></B>

 program book for the
Broadway production featured decidedly
kitschy photographs of lilac sprigs illustrating two stanzas
of "When
Lilacs Last
in the Dooryard Bloom'd," Walt Whitman's famous elegy in
memory of Abraham
Lincoln, which is recited, but only in small part, by Sam to
Rose at the
climax
of Act I in the 1929 play. Langston Hughes may have been a
Broadway novice
at the
time, but he was widely recognized as the foremost Whitman
disciple of his
generation, going beyond Carl Sandburg to embrace Whitman as
not only
<I>the
</I>American nationalist poet, but also a visionary
"outsider," a champion
of
social justice. During the two years he worked on <I>Street
Scene,
</I>Hughes
edited and introduced two collections of Whitman's poetry
and proposed to a
publisher an anthology of recent Negro and Indian poetry
entitled "Walt
Whitman's
Darker Brothers." In his introduction to the Whitman
collection published
by
Young World Books, Hughes articulated what might be
construed as the
principal
theme of <I>Street Scene: </I>"Singing the greatness of the
individual,
Whitman
also sings the greatness of unity, cooperation, and
understanding."
<sup><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
Soon after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941,
Weill, too, had
turned
to a volume of Whitman's <I>Leaves of Grass, </I>which Paul
Green had
given him
in 1938. Weill 

<B></B>

 marked a number of poems
from the Civil War collection
<I>Drum
Taps, </I>set three of them as songs for voice and piano,
and then
orchestrated
them for a recording that never materialized. Thus Whitman
had helped to
shape
all three collaborators's impressions of the American scene
and by the
time the
opera opened, a web of Whitmanesque imagery saturated
dialogue, lyrics, and
music, stretching from the black janitor's "Marble and a
Star" to the final
strains of Act II.

The musical adaptation of Rice's play preserved its
intertextual reference
to
Whitman's "Lilacs" as the conclusion to Act I, the duet
"Remember That I
Care."
Comparison of the corresponding scenes in the 1929 script
and the 1946
libretto
(see <a href=2.1kowalke_4.html> 4</a>) demonstrates
how closely the libretto adhered
to the text of
the
original play, although this duet was not among the ten
numbers for which
Elmer
Rice ultimately received credit as co-lyricist with Hughes.
In both play
and
opera, the scene containing the Whitman recitation serves a
pastoral
function
within <I>"verismo" </I>surroundings, as Sam and Rose enact
a ritual of
innocence
prior to their elders's ritual of violence.

<p>
Weill began his musical scene with melodrama, underscoring
Rose's and Sam's
conversation in response to Sam's rhetorical question, "What
good does
[graduating from college with honors] do you when nobody
ever looks at
you--when
nobody cares whether you exist or not?" Anticipating Rose's
answer, "I
care,
Sam," Weill reprises, with muted strings, the refrain of
Rose's ballad
"What Good
Would the Moon Be?" in which she had asked herself similar
questions. When
the
topic of their dialogue turns to rumors about Rose's mother
and her affair
with
the milk collector, the orchestra presents chromatically
twisted
variations on
Mrs. Maurrant's aria, "Somehow I Never Could Believe." Mrs.
Buchanan's
scream of
labor pain precipitates Sam's monologue on the subject of
his own
existential
torment and wrenches the musical idiom out of melodrama and
onto a highly
charged
operatic plane, accompanied by full orchestra and
characterized by the
greatest
density of chromaticism, dissonance, and asymmetries in Act
I. At the
fortissimo
climax of this expressionistic outburst--as close as one
comes to <I>Der
Protagonist </I> in Weill's Broadway works--"the
scream of birth,
the moan
of death" give way to a dejected reformulation of Sam's
question, "What
else has
life got to give?" The orchestra dwindles to only the lowest
members of the
woodwind, brass, and string choirs, thereby providing
maximum timbral
contrast
with Rose's response.

<p>
Her answer, now sung rather than spoken, is once again
anticipated
orchestrally,
with a reprise of the instrumental introduction to "What
Good Would the
Moon Be?"
Marked "tranquillo" in its original appearance in Number 12,
the recalled
music
opens up a pastoral space, a folk-like realm suffused with
pentatonicism,
where
urban musical intrusions are banished by almost magically
transcendent
instrumental textures and fifth-generated harmonies which
coalesce from
celeste,
bells, harp, strings, and solo woodwinds. Here the
intratextual reference
to
Rose's cavatina articulates the scene's (and the opera's)
central visual
and
poetic image, "the lilac bush flow'ring bright." Her
recollection of
seeing the
lilac bush in the park is accompanied in the orchestra by
the melody to
which Sam
will soon recite the third 

<B></B>

 [<a
href="2.1kowalke_4.html">re 4</a>] <b>[Begin Page 49]</B>

 stanza of Whitman's "When Lilacs Last in the
Dooryard
Bloom'd." A single stanza stands in for that entire elegy,
because Weill
omitted
the first strophe, the "false start" of the poem in the
play. The remaining
fragment seems self-contained in its imagery: Sam and Rose,
two
first-generation
children of immigrants, yearn for a small parcel of the
utopian America
symbolized by lilacs in Whitman's pastoral vision and denied
those trapped
in the
city's prisons for the human spirit. With the first stanza
omitted, the
referent
of "the great star early droop'd in the western sky" is no
longer
explicit, and
thus available only to those in the audience already
familiar with the
entire
poem. Similarly, the lilac sprigs are not associated
explicitly with
President
Lincoln's casket, so they can function as a symbol of hope
rather than
mourning.
Weill thereby transforms Whitman's memorial for Lincoln into
a
universalized
expression of mutual affection, a bond between individuals
that must be
the basis
for any honest relationship or just society. And yet, this
diatonic
respite from
Sam's existential despair can be only temporary; those in
the audience who
know
their Whitman already intuit that the thrush's death carol
must soon be
tallied.

Weill's reading makes Whitman's text seem both more and less
than it was
originally and as quoted in Rice's play. As soon as Sam
begins to recite
the
poem, to luxuriant, <I>cantabile </I>orchestral sonorities,
<I>intra</I>textual
references to Rose's cavatina give way to an<I>
inter</I>textual allusion
to the
last vocal utterance in Act II of Puccini's <I>Madama
Butterfly, </I>the
"sostenuto dolcemente" at rehearsal Number 84: "Dammi sul
viso un tocco di
carmino," (put on a touch of rouge).
<sup><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
Puccini's and Weill's
melodies
are nearly identical for three measures, yet there seem to
be no directly
congruent textual parallels that might account for the
musical reference
(<a href=2.1kowalke_5a.html>5</a>). However, the
moment in Puccini follows immediately upon
Butterfly's and
Suzuki's famous "flower duet," where images of fragrant
cherry blossoms,
lilies,
jasmine, and violets from the spring garden give Butterfly
new hope as she
decorates the house in anticipation of Pinkerton's arrival:
"diedi pianto
alla
zolla, essa i suoi fior mi da" (I have given tears to the
earth and she
gives her
flowers to me). Suspicions, voiced by numerous critics ever
since <I>Street
Scene</I>'s premiere, that the allusion might be fortuitous
or the musical
idiom
merely "secondhand Puccini" in a more general sense may be
dispelled if one
recalls that the corresponding pastoral moment in <I>Madama
Butterfly
</I>is
prompted by the appearance of an American warship in port:
"Hold my
trembling
hand so that I may read the name: ABRAHAM LINCOLN!"

<p>
For those in <I>Street Scene</I>'s audience who really knew
their Puccini,
this
must have seemed the quintessential musical pun; on
reflection, however,
the
allusion is characteristically ambiguous. Because it both
"distances" and
"affects," its reading presents a challenge. In their duet,
Butterfly and
Suzuki
sing ecstatically of anticipated happiness now that
Butterfly's
long-suffering
faith and hope appear to have been vindicated. They decorate
the house with
flowers; then Suzuki applies makeup to both Butterfly and
her son, in
anticipation of Butterfly's reunion with his father. Soon,
of course, her
"American dream" will be dashed; Pinkerton, incapable of
bridging the
ethnic/cultural gulf that separates them, has married
someone else in
America.
Butterfly's pastoral respite is now recognized to have been
false hope.

 In
Act II
of <I>Street Scene, </I>Sam's sister Shirley tries to
protect her younger
brother
and gives Rose advice that could have been lifted from the
libretto of
<I>Madama
Butterfly: </I>"It's better to marry with your own kind. You
can't mix oil
and
water." The cultural chasm between first-generation Russian
Jewish and
Irish
Catholic immigrants living within the same apartment
building seems even
more
forbidding than that separating Puccini's couple: the
allusion tells us
that Sam
and Rose's relationship is doomed, before it has a chance to
blossom.
<sup><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>

<p>
As Rose echoes Sam's recitation of Whitman, she gets carried
away by his
rapturous personalization of the poem. Sam then builds to a
climax as he
sings of
breaking off a sprig of lilac, and Rose joins him in
claiming their fair
share of
the American dream. Immediately, however, Rose retreats from
the emotional
heights she had briefly scaled with Sam and recounts the
reality she had
encountered in the park earlier in the day. Here the
libretto again
paraphrases
dialogue from the play, and all inter- and intratextual
references are left
behind. But Buchanan does not enter at this point, as he did
in the play.
Instead
Sam regains the emotional pitch of his "pain" monologue as
he rails
against the
obstacles standing between him and the lilac bush. Weill had
explained to
Hughes
how he wanted the borders of the finale's lyrical space
extended at this
moment,
compensating for the omission of the first stanza of
Whitman:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
When Rose sings about the policeman in the park she should
continue but
the lilac
bush is there, it is ours, nobody can take it from us--and
that should
build into
a beutiful [sic] duet which reaches its climax (after a
short interruption
with
Buchanan) when he asks her to kiss him, and here, the
lilac-bush theme
should
sing out in the orchestra.
<sup><a NAME="REF76"
HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></sup><!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Indeed, Rose's reminder that the
lilac
bush is theirs--at least in their dreams--allows them to
regain, for the
first
time singing in unison, the ecstatic heights of "A sprig
with its flower we
break." Then, with Rose leading the way, they finally arrive
at a
"tranquillo"
plateau: "And when you see the lilac bush, Bright in the
morning air,
Remember,
always remember, Remember that I care." Singing as if with
one voice, Sam
and
Rose sustain <I>fortissimo </I>high A's for three measures
on the word
"remember," while the orchestra creates an overwhelming
Puccinian climax
with a
tutti recall of the Butterfly-related melodic material--in
the manner of a
parallel <I>fortississimo </I>moment when Puccini's heroine
sings "Trionfa
il mio
amor! La mia f&egrave; trionfa intera" (My love triumphs! My
faith
triumphs over
everything!), also climaxing on a high A (rehearsal Number
70).

<p>
As Weill had suggested to Hughes, Buchanan's entry then cuts
off the final
cadence of the Whitman Duet, and underscoring abruptly
disrupts the idyll.
Maurrant calls Rose into the house, but before she goes
upstairs Sam asks
awkwardly, "Rose, will you kiss me?" She responds as she had
in the play,
"Why,
of course I will, Sam." But after the Whitman text had been
filtered
through
Weill's passionate music, the stage directions from the
original play
proved
unsuitable for the kiss: "She offers him her lips. He clasps
her in a
fervent
embrace, to which she submits but does not respond. Freeing
herself gently
. . ."
Instead the opera's libretto indicates only that "she kisses
him," and the
orchestra accompanies the embrace with a "molto 

<B></B>

 crescendo" of the lilac
theme.
Weill knew the power of his own music; the same day he had
outlined the
Whitman
Duet for Hughes, he wrote to Rouben Mamoulian, whom he hoped
to persuade to
direct the production, and summarized the differences
between the original
play
and his plans for the opera: "The love story between Sam and
Rose will be
made
more important and more passionate." Indeed, in the musical
adaptation, it
is
Rose who initiates the reprise of the Whitman duet after the
kiss. This
time,
however, any associations of the orchestral flourish with
Butterfly are
sublimated to the fresher memory of the "lilac bush, Bright
in the morning
air,"
as the intratextual reminiscence overwhelms the intertextual
allusion. Sam
rejoins the reverie, but Henry, the black janitor, cuts
short any
possibility of
prolonged rhapsody, as he reiterates a shred of his own
utopic credo, the
blues-tempo "I got a marble and a star," code words for his
less-than-cosmic game
of craps.

<p>
This was again Weill doing what he knew how to do, although
"love duets"
are as
rare in his American works as in his European ones. The
Whitman duet calls
to
mind, both textually and musically, another which serves as
an act finale,
"Auf
jener Stra&szlig;e," the ending of Act II of <I>Der
Silbersee </I>.
Here
too the soprano and tenor, Fennimore and Severin, sing with
unveiled
idealism,
eschewing avowals of erotic love in favor of another
pastoral vision, not
of a
lilac bush but of a magical frozen lake that "will carry
whoever must go
further"
(Wer weiter mu&szlig;, den tr&auml;gt der Silbersee). On the
eve of
Germany's
darkest decade, Weill had responded in his unguarded lyrical
mode to Georg
Kaiser's glimpse of a socialist utopia, with exquisite
pentatonic

<sup><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
Perhaps the
earliest
manifestation in one of Weill's dramatic works of what Horst
Koegler would
describe as "a sincerity of feeling that is not afraid to
reveal itself as
such"
was the so-called "Kraniche Duett," composed in 1929 as a
substitute for
the
censored "Liebe" brothel scene in Act II of <I>Aufstieg und
Fall der Stadt
Mahagonny.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
There, too, uncensored expression of
affection by
another decidedly non-stereotypical couple stands near the
center of the
drama in
sharp relief against highly intertextual and estranging
musical
surroundings. The
head of Universal Edition's opera department, Hans
Heinsheimer, recognized
the
"Crane Duet" as a stylistic breakthrough:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
This is the reason I consider this scene in <I>Mahagonny
</I>so especially
important: here you bring the style of 1928 to a close, here
the new sound
of the
coming years becomes audible, that sound which I believe is
created out of
a new
romanticism, a new longing, a new search for the
<I>"unattainable," </I>in
short,
an emotional realm which must fully embrace the <I>neue
Sachlichkeit
</I>in order
to transcend it.
<sup><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Agreeing that the music of <I>Mahagonny
</I>far
surpassed that of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper, </I>Adorno too
singled out the
<I>"carmenhaft" </I>duet of Jimmy and Jenny: like Carmen, it
is at once
"captivating and enigmatic."
<sup><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>

<p>
But when Heinsheimer's prediction for Weill's future path
was validated in
<I>Der
Jasager, Die B&uuml;rgschaft, </I>and <I>Der Silbersee,
</I>such lyrical
passages
of direct emotional expression challenged the prescription
for "surrealist
music"
Adorno had extrapolated from <I>Mahagonny:</I> 

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
The surrealistic intentions of <I>Mahagonny </I>are borne
out by the music,
which, from the first note to the last, is dedicated to the
shock which the
sudden representation of the disintegrated bourgeois world
engenders . . .
. This
music, pieced together from triads and off-notes with the
steady beat of
old
music hall songs, which we hardly recognize any more but are
nonetheless
remembered like an heirloom, is hammered and glued together
with the fetid
mucilage of a soggy potpourri of operas. This music, made up
of the debris
of
past music, is completely contemporary . . . . The music is
allowed to
make use
of triads because it doesn't believe in them; rather, it
destroys them
through
the very manner in which they are used.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
When, therefore, Weill's post-<I>Mahagonny </I>European
music failed to
"shy away
from direct expression," "superimpose its own criticism," or
"electrify its
audiences while slapping them in the face," Adorno turned
his back on it,
and
Weill.
<sup><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
Weill himself recognized that he had left the
<I>Mahagonny</I>-manner behind. After the war, in December
1948, he wrote
to La
Scala in Milan: <I>"Mahagonny </I>is very much an expression
of the decade
after
the First World War." He suggested that instead the famous
opera house
should
consider <I>Street Scene, </I>"an American opera in the true
sense of the
word,
probably the only opera in the vernacular of the large
American
city."
<sup><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>

<p>
Shortly before <I>Street Scene </I>had closed its Broadway
run after 148
performances attended by nearly a quarter of a million
people (but at a
loss of
the producers' entire investment of $148,000), Weill
received a letter
from Georg
Kaiser's widow, with the news that the Hebbel Theater in
Berlin intended to
produce <I>Der Silbersee. </I>Weill did not object, but
could supply no
music: "I
had a letter from Universal Edition with the laconic
notification that all
my
full scores had been confiscated by the Gestapo . . . . I
don't have a
single
partitur of my European works and therefore at the moment I
can't say if
one can
procure them anywhere."
<sup><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
Thus he devoted his energies toward
interesting European opera houses and publishers in what had
been a
Broadway
"flop." He wrote to Langston Hughes: "It is no use fooling
ourselves that
the
songs we have written are hit-parade material, because they
are
not."
<sup><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
When discussing European representation of the work
with
Boosey and Hawkes and Universal Edition, he offered to
expand the
orchestration
from 33 to the standard opera orchestra and to effect
several other musical
changes that would make the piece less "Broadway" and more
"opera."
<sup><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>
During his only trip back to Europe (in 1947), he personally
promoted
<I>Street
Scene </I>in London, Paris, and Z&uuml;rich. He avoided
Germany. Upon his
return,
he told Maxwell Anderson that he was planning a symphonic
suite from
<I>Street
Scene </I>and several more Whitman songs. But Weill
completed only "Come
Up From
the Fields, Father" and did not live to see the stage work
that he deemed
his
most significant performed in the Old World.

<p>
The posthumous European premiere of <I>Street Scene </I>in
D&uuml;sseldorf
during
the 1955-56 season promised to be an auspicious occasion:
the cast would
include
Randolph Symonette (who had played the role of Mr. Maurrant
for most of the 

<B></B>

Broadway run), two numbers cut from the opera during
Philadelphia tryouts
were to
be restored, Lenya would attend, and, not least, Adorno--of
all
people--would
write an essay for the program book. But his essay, "Nach
einem
Vierteljahrhundert" (after a quarter-century), turned out to
be little
more than
a refunctioning of his obituary of Weill in the guise of a
retrospective on
<I>Die Dreigroschenoper </I>and <I>Mahagonny. </I>Although
Adorno
dismissed the
genre of the "Musical" as "merchandised nuisance," he never
mentioned
<I>Street
Scene </I>or any of Weill's other American works by name.
Instead, Adorno
again
hailed those works with Brecht that were characteristic of
the "dilemma of
all
modern art," while planting seeds of doubt about Weill's own
awareness of
the
nature of his achievement:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Like no other music, Weill's stood for the collective image
of the time
during
which it became famous . . . . Its power depends on the
decline of the
time whose
passing it chronicles . . . . Only derision and mockery of
sentiment were
left in
his music, thereby giving expression to a mourning for all
that had been
doomed
by history . . . . But it remains ambiguous just how far the
music commits
itself
to this and how far Weill denounced what he had co-executed
without
commentary .
. . . He would rather sacrifice musical standards than
coherence of
theatrical
effect, for which his method of response had been calculated
<I>&agrave; la
</I>Offenbach, to whom he liked to compare himself.
<sup><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The
subversive
power of Adorno's essay was sufficient to sabotage critical
reception of
<I>Street Scene, </I>as the young Horst Koegler, a recent
refugee from East
Berlin, observed in a review essay entitled "Der Vortrupp
der Musicals"
(the
vanguard of the musical):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
It should come as no surprise that two days after the
premiere the
D&uuml;sseldorfers opened their morning papers to be told by
their critics
that
they had attended an operatic funeral of the first class.
Those present at
the
premiere would hardly have noticed anything like a funereal
atmosphere.
Instead
they applauded after almost every other number of the score
and at the end
called
the members of the cast in front of the curtain some twenty
times . . . .
Though
none of the critics denied the success with the audience, it
didn't
prevent one
of them from putting two short sentences together: "Reicher
Beifall. Wie
denn
auch nicht!" [Lots of applause. What else would you expect!]
Those six
words are
too beautiful to resist the temptation to reflect upon a
group of critics
who
obviously champion progressivism at any price--to whom any
genuine public
success
is suspect from the outset.
<sup><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Throwing down the gauntlet at Adorno's feet, Koegler jumped
to the defense
of
American musical theater in general and Weill in particular,
while
challenging
ideological and aesthetic clich&eacute;s:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
The assessment of Kurt Weill's Broadway successes swings
back and forth
according
to the critics'--or their respective newspaper's--political
point of view.
Between them, practically every perspective is represented:
from the
tradition-conscious European's feeling of infinite
superiority,
nonchalantly
looking down on the fully-automatic American "un-culture";
to the rueful
mea
culpa one--after all, we were the ones who 

<B></B>

 had driven Weill into the
desert of
the rich flesh pots. Therefore over here--or at least as far
as our
critics are
concerned--practically everything which carries the stamp of
a Broadway
success
has been condemned to failure.
<sup><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Although his counteroffensive
may
have been overstated and under-documented, Koegler correctly
observed
that--before his emigration--Weill had severed himself from
Brecht and what
Adorno termed surrealism: "At that time he had long outgrown
the
<I>Dreigroschenoper, </I>to which some people stubbornly try
to weld him .
. . .
Nobody who knows his work not just from the shark with the
teeth in his
face will
deny that Weill secretly has been a romantic."
<sup><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>

<p>
In his reply to Koegler, "Vortrupp und Avantgarde," Adorno
made passing
reference
to <I>Down in the Valley </I>and the songs from <I>Lady
</I>and <I>Venus
</I>which he found difficult to distinguish from Cole
Porter, but there is
still
nothing to indicate that he had become more familiar with or
had actually
attended a performance of <I>Street Scene. </I>Instead, he
rebuffed
Koegler's
attack by expanding his original argument, this time making
more explicit
its
underlying premises, respectively technical and
sociological: 1.
Weill-after-Brecht had failed to adopt a progressive musical
language and
thus
was more culpable than Stravinsky (or Britten and
Shostakovich) of the
charges
which Weill-with-Brecht had only narrowly avoided by
transferring the
"Verfremdungseffekt" (estranging effect) into the musical
realm; 2.
objections to
the pseudo-individualized, mass-produced cultural
merchandise Adorno
thought to
be "jazz" (actually German commercial music of the 1920s)
were equally
applicable
to American musical theater.
<sup><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>
Jazz and the "Musical" were
linked in
Adorno's mind because the "popular song," <I>Schlager,
</I>served as the
central
unit of both. As so-called "mass music," popular songs,
jazz, and musicals
are
all necessarily anonymous, or at best pseudo-individualized.
Only the
formulas
need be deciphered, not the individual uses thereof, for
this music is not
"that
which it is" but "that for which it is employed." And just
as Adorno rarely
mentions in his jazz criticism the name of a jazz composer
or performer,
the
title of a song or jazz number, or a particular recording or
live
performance, so
the "Musical" is discussed only in generic terms, without
reference to
specific
works. The person responsible for the music of a "Musical"
is not a real
composer, but a <I>Musikregisseur, </I>comparable to the
jazz arranger,
making
music to fit the contingencies of the situation. Adorno
closed his
sarcastic
reply by declining Koegler's suggestion that he write an
essay "Vom Altern
der
neuen Kritik" (new criticism is growing old) and countering
with his own
assignment for Koegler, "Der Highbrow als Lowbrow," the
theme of which he
outlined: "The highbrow has in many places set himself up as
the staunch
cultural
advocate of the lowbrow. For God's sake, it would be better
for him to
remain a
highbrow and let himself be called a snob."
<sup><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>

<p>
In this assignment for Koegler, Adorno had unwittingly
invoked terminology
from
Constant Lambert's 1933 review of <I>Die sieben
Tods&uuml;nden, </I>in
which he
compared Weill with Adorno's teacher:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
Even those who do not find Weill's music sympathetic must
realize that he
symbolizes the split that is taking place not between
highbrow and
lowbrow, but
between highbrow 

<B></B>

 and highbrow . . . .
He and Alban Berg represent the two
extremes of Central European aesthetic, and in their widely
different ways
are
the most successful exponents of their respective styles.
<sup><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Had
Adorno
been more familiar with Weill's Broadway works in general
and <I>Street
Scene
</I>in particular, he surely would have chosen different
turf for his
battle with
Koegler, for <I>Street Scene, </I>as we have seen, can't be
easily
dismissed as
"Kitsch," the category to which Adorno automatically assigns
the
"Musical." On
the other hand, in the wake of the triumphant European tours
of Robert
Breen's
production of <I>Porgy and Bess, </I>Koegler's appropriation
of <I>Street
Scene
</I>as a platform from which to challenge the prevailing
ideology of
post-World
War II Central European musical modernism must have seemed
strategically
defensible. It is in this larger aesthetic context that we
must ultimately
situate the Adorno-Koegler polemic in particular and the
two-Weill debate
in
general.

<p>
Weill, the composer whom Richard Taruskin has identified as
"perhaps the
twentieth century's most problematical major musician"
("RT"), seems in
retrospect a, if not <I>the, </I>representative re
reifying the key
issues at
hand: modernism versus counter- or postmodernism, elitism
versus populism;
autonomy versus accessibility; originality versus
comprehensibility;
atonality
versus tonality. He anticipated in the second quarter of our
century what
can now
be seen in the fourth as the central "problem" of the entire
post-War
period:
what is the "genuine" or "authentic" modern music of our
century? It was
precisely this question which Adorno himself raised in 1949
at the
conclusion of
his <I>Philosophie der neuen Musik: </I>"Perhaps the only
authentic art
will be
that which renounces the very idea of authenticity itself,
of being one
particular way rather than another."
<sup><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>
However, Adorno's
ongoing
attempts to refunction the historical paradigm of musical
progress,
extending
from Bach through Beethoven to Schoenberg and his serial
successors,
required
affirmation of aesthetic autonomy, work immanence, and
originality as the
<I>sine
qua non </I>for "authenticity." When these values came under
increasing
scrutiny
and attack in the "pluralistic, postmodern, and
aesthetically entropic
world"
Adorno left behind at the time of his death in 1969,
salvaging that part
of his
mission which would stave off collapse of the Austro-German
"great works"
tradition became a key component in what James Hepokoski has
called the
"Dahlhaus
Project."
<sup><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>
Although Weill's name appears in Carl Dahlhaus's
writings
only rarely and always in tandem with Brecht's, he is by
inference one of
those
"opera composers who felt unequal to the aesthetic problems
imposed upon
their
genre by Modernism" and therefore "sacrificed stylistic
modernity to
theatrical
effectiveness and thereby lost all claim to historical
'authenticity.'"
<sup><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></sup>
In a history of music whose ideology required
"relative autonomy" for itself as well as its subject, it
becomes clear,
for
reasons too obvious to restate, why Weill ends up on
Dahlhaus's "ash heap
of
music history."

<p>
"Had Weill continued to develop after 1933 as he had in the
previous
years,"
begins David Drew's final paragraph in the <I>New Groves
</I>Weill-entry,
"he
could have become one of the commanding res in German
music" rather
than "one
of 

<B></B>

 music's great 'might have beens,'"
as its last sentence concludes. It
would
seem, therefore, that Weill's American works will require a
defense
protecting
them against their success which is more vigorous and
imaginative than
Adorno's
for <I>Die Dreigroschenoper, </I>because the split between
autonomy and
accessibility and what Richard Crawford has termed
"composers' music" and
"performers' music" (as an alternative to the categories of
<I>E-Musik/U-Musik,
</I>"serious"/"popular," or "cultivated"/"vernacular") has
always seemed
more
pronounced on American soil. In <I>The American Musical
Landscape,
</I>Crawford
frames the debate in post-Adornian terms:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
autonomy--the right to compose essentially outside the
strictures of
audience
esteem, or critic's approval, or the tastes and preferences
of performers
. . .
Through hard labor and the acceptance of a lofty, lonely
vision of their
calling,
composers have carved out for themselves an autonomous
niche. Autonomy has
expressed itself in a feeling that . . . composers are
perhaps the best
judges of
each others' works. The twentieth century has seen the
gradual alienation
of many
composers of composers' music from other musical trades and
occupations
and from
much of the concert-going audience as well.
<!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In contrast, Crawford says, "where music reflects the
pressures of the
marketplace, money and musical style are closely
intermingled.
Accessibility
seeks out the center of the marketplace. It privileges
occasions over
works. And
it invests ultimate authority in the present-day audience."
Authenticity in
performance is closely linked with autonomy, as
"authenticity privileges
works
over occasions."
<sup><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></sup>

<p>
Among Central European &eacute;migr&eacute;
composers, the extreme exemplars of Crawford's taxonomy
were, of course,
Schoenberg and Weill. When asked in 1950 how migration had
affected the
character
and quality of his own work in America, Schoenberg replied:
"If
immigration to
America has changed me--I am not aware of it . . . . Maybe I
would have
written
more when remaining in Europe, but I think: nothing comes
out, what was
not in.
And two times two equals four in every climate. Maybe I had
<I>four times
four
</I>times harder to work for a living. But I made no
concessions to the
market."
<sup><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></sup>
In his own manifesto of 1940, Weill articulated his
agenda
by contrasting it with Schoenberg's: "I'm convinced that
many modern
composers
have a feeling of superiority toward their audiences . . . .
I write for
today."
<sup><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></sup>
Such statements make Andreas Huyssen's bold assertion
that
"mass culture has always been the hidden subtext of the
modernist project"
seem
almost a truism, and they call to mind aesthetic and
sociological
conflicts that
extend at least as far back as Nietzsche's indictment of
Wagner: "Success
with
the masses no longer sides with those who are authentic . .
. . Wherever
the
decision comes to rest with the masses, authenticity becomes
superfluous,
disadvantageous, a liability."
<sup><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></sup>

<p>
In the American musical
theater,
Weill encountered these same issues, intricately
intertwined: compositional
"work" and performance "event" overlapped and merged in the
process of
production; in non-subsidized venues accessibility took
precedence over
autonomy;
and popular exploitation and adaptation of single numbers
(stripped of
their
original dramatic context and function) by performers active
in commercial
music
tended to undermine the integrity of his music for the
theater. 

<B></B>

 But if we
recall
Heinsheimer's and Downes's parallel exhortations to the
composer, written
in 1929
and 1949 respectively ("You should and must free yourself
once and for all
from
Berlin's commercialized artistic activity" and "I am still
waiting for the
day
when you get exactly the subject which you can treat without
the faintest
consideration of public taste or expediency of any sort"),
the "two-Weill"
debate
cannot be disguised as cultural or geographical--European
versus
American--in
nature or origin. Though ostensibly raised by biographical
circumstances
and
historical events, the issues are central to the
self-conscious dilemma
during
the entire modernist period concerning the nature, meaning,
and purpose of
art in
general and of musical expression in particular.

<p>
"What are the aims of music?" Weill's teacher Ferruccio
Busoni had asked
in his
<I>Entwurf einer neuen Aesthetik der Tonkunst </I>(sketch
for a new
aesthetic of
music; 1907) and then tried to answer anew after World War I
with his
concept of
"junge Klassizit&auml;t" and his opera <I>Doktor Faust.</I>
<sup><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></sup>
Such
post-war attempts to reconcile past and present were
characteristic of what
Martha Bayles calls "extroverted modernism," whose attitude
toward
accessibility/popularity differentiates it from its
"introverted" and
"perverse"
kin.
<sup><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></sup>
If, in aspiring to be, as Busoni quipped, "a Verdi of
the
poor,"
<sup><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></sup>
by 1927 Weill had rejected the former option--"working
toward
the solution of aesthetic problems as if behind closed
doors," eliminating
the
criterion of accessibility or popularity from aesthetic
judgments, and
cultivating indifference, even hostility toward the
audience--his
subsequent
"perverse" or surrealist phase did not outlast his
collaboration with
Brecht and
the fall of <I>Mahagonny</I>.
<sup><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></sup>

<p>
In 1930 Erwin Stein, then the head of Universal Edition's
orchestral
division,
tried to change Weill's mind and convince him "to make
another appearance
as an
absolute composer," thereby "expanding your sphere of
influence and making
your
work felt in circles which have been up in arms against
you": "And don't
tell me
that you don't give a for such people--you must make an
effort to win
them
over as musicians."
<sup><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></sup>
Shortly before he fled Berlin for Paris
Weill
did accept a commission for a symphony from the Princesse
Edmond de
Polignac, but
after its premiere by the Concertgebouw Orchestra under
Bruno Walter in
1934 he
dismissed the effort as "not very important." Soon after his
arrival in the
United States, Weill reaffirmed the futility of writing
autonomous music:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_/extract-->
In our time theater-music is far more important than
absolute music. Maybe
that
was not true in previous centuries, but it certainly is now.
Concerts are
becoming more and more the property of--how do you call
them?--stuffed
shirts.
The recital hall is obsolete.
<sup><a NAME="REF106"
HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></sup><!--_extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
In privileging stylistic
diversity
over individual subjectivity, the theater over the concert
hall, the
audience
over the composer-critic, the "immediate" over the
"difficult," Weill made
no
apologies: "I want to use whatever gifts I have for
practical purposes,
not waste
them on things which have no life, or which have to be kept
alive by
artificial
means. That's why I've made that theater which exists
without benefit of
subsidy
my life work" ("CT"). Music could not afford to be only "in
and of
itself." Weill
required that it aspire to extrinsic value and serve as a
means to moral or
political 

<B></B>

 impact on an audience
expecting to be pleased and entertained as
well
as edified. No wonder, then, that within Adorno's
uncompromising and
rigorously
"introverted" stance, such a composer scarcely qualified as
a <I>Komponist
</I>at
all, and two Weills had to be created so that the
"historically authentic"
part
of him could be salvaged. But in declining to be <I>einsam
</I>and daring
to be
<I>&ouml;ffentlich, </I>Weill had been attempting all along
to redefine not
himself, but modern music theater and its audience, as well
as the
aesthetic and
historical model in which he must be divided in two.

Earlier drafts of sections of this essay were presented at a
symposium on
Weill's
American works co-sponsored by the Houston Grand Opera and
the Goethe
House,
Houston (29 January 1994) and a conference "Biographische
Konstellation und
k&uuml;nstlerisches Handeln" in Frankfurt am Main,
co-sponsored by the Paul
Hindemith Institute and the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik (25
February 1994). A
longer version of this essay, directed toward a European
musicological
audience,
will be published with the proceedings of the conference:

Dietrich eventually declined the role, claiming that it was
"too sexy and
profane" for her, an ironic excuse made more so by Mary
Martin's portrayal
of
Venus. In autumn 1933 Dietrich had requested two songs from
Weill as revue
and
recording material, but there is no record of her performing
or recording
either
of his responses, "Der Abschiedsbrief" and "Es regnet." In
March 1934
Dietrich
did, however, lobby Josef von Sternberg to invite Weill to
Hollywood to
collaborate on her planned musical film; protracted
negotiations came to
naught.

informed Ira
Gershwin in
a letter of 8 March 1941:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Virgil Thomson wrote a violent attack against me. t was all
very personal
and his
main point was that I am no good any more since I stopped
working with
Brecht and
that I am "constantly avoiding" collaborating with "major
poets" (a rather
bold
statement, don't you think so?). Well, I am used to this
kind of attacks
from the
part of jealous composers. In some form or another it
happens every time I
do a
new show.

next was a
flattering

Thomson's,
Weill discouraged his producers from inviting music critics,

<I>The Saturday Review of Literature, </I>31 December 1949.
It is in
this
essay that Clurman first articulates his "Hottentot
metaphor." Clurman
had been
one of three founding directors of the Group Theatre; in
1936 he was
replaced
during rehearsals as stage director of <I>Johnny Johnson
</I>by Lee
Strasberg.
After the Group disbanded, Clurman became one of the most
highly respected
theater critics in New York. Weill was deeply offended by
the essay; among
his
surviving papers are (mostly illegible) pencil notes and two
typewritten
paragraphs in response to Clurman (Series 41, Box 2).
Weill's prefatory
paragraph
does not disguise his sense of personal betrayal: "It always
seemed to me
one of
the more commendable customs of our time is that a man
should not talk
back to
his critic. If I don't adhere to this rule in the case of
Harold Clurman's
article 'Lost in the Stars of Broadway,' it is because it
seems to me that
this
article was not written as a criticism of my music (since
Clurman
certainly is
not a music critic), but as a well-meant advice from an old
friend."
Weill's
projected defense seems to rest on the premise that "certain
musical
circles are
so far removed from the living theater that they have little
understanding
for a
movement which has its roots more in theatrical than in
musical
developments.
This is nothing new . . . . When I started writing music in
Europe in the
early
twenties, Verdi was looked upon as a writer of 'Circus
Music' and Carmen
was
generally considered an 'operetta' in musical circles. . . .
Some people
don't
seem to think that music [written for Broadway] is 'good
music.'"

February 1951. Note that Thomson's assessment had been quite
different in
his
1950 obituary of Weill: "Everything he wrote became in one
way or another
historic. He was probably the most original single workman
in the whole
musical
theatre, internationally considered, during the last quarter
century . . .
Every
work was a new model, a new shape, a new solution of
dramatic problems."

In 1938, however, Lenya had reported to Weill in Hollywood
that she
was going
"to have dinner with that Ho-ho-Wiesengrund at the home of
Jews from
Frankfurt .
. . After dinner, they will make an abortion of the music
they'll play."
Letter
from Lenya to Weill, 10 May 1938. Apparently Weill and
Adorno never met in
New
York, as a letter of 31 March 1942 from Adorno in Brentwood
Heights, Los
Angeles,
to Weill in New City, New York, begins: "Dear Weill, it will
amaze you to
hear
from me all of a sudden after so long a time and an
ill-fated rendezvous
in New

"since WEILL was making difficulties about the negro
production of DIE

responded

broadway, which

pioneered. the last play he did the music for ran 14 months.

Adorno
had included his reviews of <I>American Jazz Music </I>by
Wilder Hobson and
<I>Jazz: Hot and Hybrid </I>by Winthrop Sargent. Weill's
response to
Adorno has
not been located; his summary to Lenya (letter of 8 April

from
Brecht's:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[Clarence] Muse writes me that Brecht had told him last
summer he had
written to
me and I didn't answer! The good old swinish Brecht method.
Well, I wrote
Wiesengrund a letter which he won't forget for some time. I
wrote him: It
is a
shame that a man of your intelligence should be so
misinformed. Then I
explained
him that the American Theatre isn't as bad as he thinks and
in the end I
said,
"maybe the main difference between the German and the
American theatre is
the
fact that there exist certain rules of fair play in the
American theatre."

Public,

Market: Kurt Weill and Universal Edition" in <I>A New
Orpheus, </I>29-31.
Even if
he had been so inclined, Weill would have been unable, given
political and
economic circumstances, to follow his publisher's admonition
to avoid
"commercialized artistic activity." Not a single work of
Weill composed
after
1927 and intended for production by state-subsidized
theaters or opera
houses
found a secure home there. Most notably, all three of
Berlin's opera houses
declined to produce <I>Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny
</I>after its
highly
politicized reception in the provinces. Similarly, the
Kampfbund f&uuml;r
Deutsche Kultur assured that there could be no successors to
the three
productions of <I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft </I>which premiered
within a single
week in
March 1932. Less than a year later three productions of
<I>Der Silbersee
</I>opened simultaneously in Leipzig, Erfurt, and Magdeburg,
but soon
closed
under a blanket edict. <I>Der Kuhhandel </I>and <I>Der Weg
der Verheissung
</I>could find no appropriate venue anywhere in Europe.
Already in Europe,
then,
more and more of Weill's plans and projects had addressed
themselves to
alternative institutions where diverse combinations of
executants and
audiences
could be assembled ad hoc: radio, schools, film,
metropolitan commercial
theaters.

Letter from Downes to Weill, 9 December 1949. Downes noted
the
"remarkable

observed:
"It's awfully interesting to me to see your hand get firmer
with each
thing you
are doing, and your new treatments and forms and new
technical resources.
It is
wonderful that you've got such an opera over on the stage.
This work, and
the
<I>Street Scene, </I>will be among the most significant
steps which have
so far
been taken both to modernize and popularize the operatic
principle, and say
something worthwhile in the artistic sense."

say, 'You are

there is no opera!' This was in 1936. The Metropolitan Opera
had a season
of
sixteen weeks, San Francisco, I think, had six weeks,
Chicago had Stock.

felt it necessary to utilize several settings of Rilke's

und Hymnus, </I>op. 6 ; at least one of the <I>Lieder

Broadway,
"Kurt
Weill on Broadway: The Postwar Years (1945-1950)," Ph.D.
Dissertation,

University, 1992, David Kilroy compares the "outsider"
characters Jud and
Sam and
contrasts the mid- and post-War cultural contexts of
<I>Oklahoma! </I>and
<I>Street Scene: </I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The lonely Jud is the uncritical male antagonist, ostracized
as an
outsider who
threatens the lily-white "folk"; the lonely Sam is an
intellectual male
protagonist, both admired and mistrusted for is outsider's
criticism of
American
society . . . Weill's presentation of his view had to wait
until after the
war's
end, for to suggest that "outsider" citizens be treated with
all due
rights and
privileges may well have been considered anti-American
during World War II
. .
.After the war had ended, however, he and Rice could hope
that the
suspension of
civil liberties that were to some degree warranted by
wartime exigencies
would
cease. Yet, fueled by <I>Oklahoma!</I>'s<I>
</I>unprecedented longevity and
continued proclamation that vigilante justice was "OK" in
the United
States, the
country was very slow in reversing its ideological direction
and became
embroiled
in other repressive activities, especially against real and
supposed
Communists.

"SP." The term "musicodramatic agent" has been borrowed from
Carl
Dahlhaus's
description of the function of setting within <I>verismo
</I>opera, where
"milieu
moves center stage as a musicodramatic 'agent.'" In this
sense at least,
<I>Street Scene </I>seems to conform to Dahlhaus's category
of operas which
feature local color or "milieu-painting": "although
<I>verismo </I>adopted
a
realist or naturalist pose by choosing subjects from normal
life and the
present
day, from the standpoint of intellectual history it can be
viewed as a
variant of
exoticism, the appeal of the faraway and remote . . . Local
color, which
seemed
'new' and yet was immediately accessible, offered a refuge
to opera
composers who
felt unequal to the aesthetic problems imposed upon their
genre by
modernism."

Letter from Weill to Hughes, 20 September 1946. David Kilroy
notes
that Weill
even offered Hughes (in a letter of 15 May 1946) Christopher
Isherwood's
translation of Peachum's "Lied von der Unzul&auml;nglichkeit
menschlichen

It was
Hughes's sense that Weill continually tried to make
<I>Street Scene

something more like <I>Die Dreigroschenoper </I>than what
Elmer Rice had
in mind.

When the collaborators needed a lyric for a dance number,
Hughes had
brought
"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed" out of his trunk; although it had
been written
years
earlier, it required virtually no changes as the text of a
32-bar popular
song.
Eventually it was cited as the best lyric of the Broadway
season.

I am grateful to Michael Pisani for pointing out the melodic
similarity of
these two passages. Although Kilroy noted the pastoral

<p>
<a NAME="FOOT75" HREF="#REF75">75</a>.
Shortly after <I>Street Scene </I>had opened on Broadway,
Weill
agreed to
appear on "Opera News on the Air," during the intermission
of a radio
broadcast
from the Metropolitan Opera--the only such invitation he is
known to have
accepted. The opera Weill agreed to discuss was <I>Madama
Butterfly.
</I>The host
of the program, Boris Goldovsky, introduced the topic of
<I>Street
Scene</I>'s
Puccini-isms: "You know, it occurs to me, Mr. Weill, that
your <I>Street
Scene
</I>is just the sort of play that would have appealed to
Puccini if he were
living and writing in America today." Weill: "I'm mighty
glad that Puccini
didn't
have a chance to see <I>Street Scene </I>when it was
produced as a play
almost 20
years ago. Because he might have beat me to it." Weill then
described
Puccini and
his opera as if speaking of himself and <I>Street Scene:
</I>"I have the
feeling
that Puccini wasn't particularly interested in musical
experimentation for
its
own sake, but rather in the effect it would have on the
audience in the
opera
house . . . . His audience had probably never heard a score
which
introduced
present day people, dressed in present day clothes, [which]
translates a
realistic story completely into music, so that the story
moves along as
swiftly
as in a legitimate play." Weill's copy of the typescript for
the interview,
annotated with his own handwritten additions and corrections
(Series 41,
Box 3),
called for Goldovsky's other guest, Irene Jordan, to mention
as one of the
highlights of <I>Madama Butterfly </I>the "glorious duet
with Suzuki,
where they
decorate the house with flowers for Pinkerton's arrival."
Goldovsky played
the
end of the flower duet, and then "another interesting
example": "the
section just
after the flower duet, where Butterfly looks at herself in
the mirror and
wonders
whether the passing of three years has robbed her of her
beauty. 'I have
changed,' she says. 'My lips have sighed too many sighs and
my eyes have
scanned
the horizon too long.'" Weill commented: "We shouldn't lose
sight of the
fact
that all these musical devices are a means to an end, not an
end in
themselves."
<I>Madama Butterfly </I>was not among the eight vocal scores
of operas in
Weill's
library inventoried by David Drew in 1960; <I>Turandot,
</I>however, was:
it had
been an opening night present for <I>Lady in the Dark
</I>inscribed to
"Giacomo
Weill from Gabriele Gershwin." Ralph Locke has suggested to
me that the
repetitive harmonic oscillation underlying the Whitman Duet
may have been
modelled on a similarly constructed passage in Calaf's Act I
aria, "Non
piangere,
Li&ugrave;," eleven measures before Rehearsal Number 46. The
orchestral
accompaniment of Sam and Rose's other duet, "We'll Go Away
Together," may
call to
mind ironically the passage immediately preceding "Un bel
di," in which
Butterfly
insists "He'll come back."

<I>Der Silbersee </I>and <I>Street Scene </I>bear comparison
in other
respects: both are hybrid works intended for performance by
a mixed cast of
singers and actors, with comparably sized orchestras.
Melodrama plays a
larger
role in the musical texture of these two works than in any
others of
Weill. Note
also the textual and musical parallels between "Auf jener
Stra&szlig;e" and
another pastoral number, "The Hills of Ixopo," the opening
of <I>Lost in
the
Stars. </I>The musical setting of this picture of pre-urban
South Africa
is also
suffused with pentatonicism, but as that idyllic landscape
is corrupted,
chromaticism enters the musical language and soon overwhelms
the folk-like
idiom
of the opening.

On 9 October 1947 Weill wrote to Max Dreyfus of Chappell:
"As you
remember, I
had great hesitations to have <I>Street Scene </I>published
by Chappell's.
I
wanted to give it to Boosey and Hawkes because with them I
would have been
sure
of the kind of standard exploitation which this score calls
for, of an
English
production (Covent Garden) and of performances in European
opera houses."
On 11
December 1948, Weill wrote to Traute von Witt at Universal
Edition in
Vienna:
"Die Oper war f&uuml;r die speziellen Erfordernisse des
Broadway-Theaters
f&uuml;r ein verh&auml;ltnism&auml;ssig kleines Orchester

ich frage mich, ob das f&uuml;r die grossen Opernh&auml;user
ausreichend
w&auml;re. Da es wahrscheinlich f&uuml;r eine

"VA." The original reads: "der highbrow hat sich vielerorten
als
biederer
kultureller Advokat der lowbrows etabliert. Lieber sollte er
in Gottes
Namen ein
highbrow bleiben und sogar sich einen Snob schimpfen
lassen." Koegler's
title,
"Vom Altern der neuen Kritik," is an intertextual reference
to a famous
essay by
Adorno, delivered as a lecture for the S&uuml;ddeutscher
Rundfunk in
Stuttgart
the year before, entitled "Das Altern der neuen Musik"
(modern music is
growing
old), first published in <I>Dissonanzen </I>(G&ouml;ttingen:
Van den Hoeck
&amp;
Ruprecht, 1956).

appraisal of Weill
was
based on the premise that accessibility was a positive
aesthetic goal:
"Some
people contend that when Kurt Weill worked in the vein of
the popular
theater he
became 'commercial.' I contend instead that he became
universal." Langston

Book, <I>Die
Strasse,

729, Langston

Schoenberg's letter to Albert Goldberg, quoted in "The
Sounding Board:
The
Transplanted Composer," <I>Los Angeles Times, </I>14 May
1950; my italics.
It is
hardly coincidental that Otto Klemperer's biographer, Peter
Heyworth,
contrasted
Schoenberg's and Weill's responses to emigration, utilizing
precisely the
same
Modernist framework as Schoenberg's: "A composer as
contemptuous of popular
success as Schoenberg was at any rate in one respect well
equipped to
endure it:
he had, after all, had long experience of existing with
little or no
public.
Weill, in contrast, was a composer for the theatre. His art
demanded a
social
context, such as the Weimar Republic had provided. In
America his search
for that
context thrust him into the marketplace. A more purposeful
character might
have
been able to stand out against the system. Weill fooled
himself into
supposing
that he could make it work for his own ends." "Lost on
Broadway," <I>Times
