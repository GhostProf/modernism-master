<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Is “making it new” a linear process of continual reinvention, or does this process involve cycling back to earlier forms of the old?</span></p>
<p>
      Whereas the traditional definition of modernism denies any mantle of commercialism, the current age of modernist studies firmly establishes modernism’s dependence upon market dynamics. The field of “Material Modernism,” initiated over the last few decades by critics such as Lawrence Rainey, Kevin Dettmar, Stephen Watt, and George Bornstein, has persuasively shown how modernism marketed itself and was disseminated to an increasingly popular audience.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Jonathan Rose and Patrick Collier, among others, have explored how modernism became the purview of working class intellectuals and was available in populist forms.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Fewer scholars, however, have taken into consideration how modernism was defined and canonized by academia. Jennifer Wicke, for one, points out the need for scholars and critics to acknowledge their own implication in establishing modernism’s “brand name,” how our scholarship is involved in the ongoing and self-defining modernist industry.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      I would take Wicke’s suggestion one step further and point out that not only is our research involved in the “marketing” of modernism, but so is our pedagogy. We, as teachers, are dealers in the multivalent forms of modernism, and the classroom is the place where the movement is “bought and sold.” Yet, as Helen Sword points out in her introduction to this collection, pedagogy is often overlooked in our highly theoretical field of study. There is a divide between what we write and the praxis of the classroom. This gap, I believe, may very well be an echo of that old academically constructed bias against seeing modernism in the marketplace.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      In an attempt to bridge this divide, I have devised a semester-long group assignment that involves students in the ongoing process of modernist vision and revision. The project uses new, student-based, digital media to teach by example how modernism aspired to innovative forms and stylistics, was spread and marketed as a cultural movement, and, finally, was dependent upon the public sphere. Assigned early in the semester as students grapple with the anomalous, protean definition(s) of modernism, the project has students construct networks of MySpace profiles based upon modernist books, characters, and authors. As part of the process of defining (or un-defining) modernism, we collectively explore many of the movement’s contradictions: how prejudice and misogyny coexisted alongside humanism and feminism; how displacement of the reader encouraged a new, democratic way of reading; how modernism was restrictive yet became the canonized and influential literature of the century.
    </p>
<p>
      The prompt gives groups (usually four students) a limited option of texts (such as Ford Maddox Ford’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Good Soldier</span> or Lawrence’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Sons and Lovers</span>) and/or coterie groups (such as Lewis, Pound, Marinetti, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span>, or Woolf’s Bloomsbury Salon) for which students produce MySpace profiles. The students research and represent biography, historical context, characterization, and criticism. They are directed to emulate stylistic experimentation in their profiles as a means of “translating” and “enacting” modernism in a non-traditional media. The rubric stresses that pages will be graded on:
    </p>
<ol class="lalpha">
<li><p>a.   
	  understanding of the text and author’s innovations;
	</p></li>
<li><p>b.   
	  creativity in capturing aspects of the work on their pages (i.e. their own stylistic innovation in capturing or updating the subject);
	</p></li>
<li><p>c.   
	  intertextuality between group members and even other groups (i.e. using the “network” aspect of both modernism and MySpace to its fullest advantage);
	</p></li>
<li><p>d.   
	  rationalization for their choices on their group’s discussion board, which includes a bibliography to substantiate research.
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continued">
      Groups are required to contribute weekly both to their profiles and to the class discussion board. This way, the profile clusters evolve organically over the course of the semester both in their sophistication and in their understanding of modernism.
    </p>
<p>
      Students respond enthusiastically and energetically to the unconventional nature of the project, which invites them to use a known language and skill to explore a difficult and academic subject. For example, their detailed historical research into textual allusions has consistently surprised me. One student’s profile for James Joyce was amazingly astute, featuring interplay between illustrations, such as numerous contemporary Dublin postcards, and biographical bulletins about Joyce’s loss of sight. Her research for the webpage led to an excellent paper on Joyce’s capturing of a fading cultural and personal visuality. Just as impressive is the way students “role play” their online interactions. A student profiling Virginia Woolf left wonderfully snide comments on the Joyce profile.
    </p>
<p>
      Even groups that do not emulate the creativity of the material can illustrate aspects of the work in other ways. For example, one <span style="font-style:italic;">Great Gatsby</span> group was complacent, just going to the 1974 film version for profile pictures and inspiration. This lackluster effort  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sparked in-class and online discussion about the dissemination and popularity of a work, how the book itself might culturally pass as high-brow or as genre novel, and about what aspects of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gatsby</span> lent themselves to adaptation. The profiles have a tendency to take on a protean life as they move across the web: groups blur, and members of the general public (i.e. non-class members) try to “friend” certain characters or res.
    </p>
<p>
      This last element of unpredictability exemplifies how this assignment teaches by example through the transition to a new medium. “Viral” has become the term for inexplicable, runaway popularity online, and the network aspect of the assignment mirrors the viral way in which modernism originally spread. Critics such as Mark Morrison, Michael Murphy, and Joyce Wexler have explored how modernism infiltrated the public sphere via youth culture, slick magazines, and sensationalism.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Such explorations help explain the disparity between the wide cultural influence of modernism and the fact that much modernist writing originally appeared in restricted formats such as little magazines. The MySpace project, when paired with themes about dissemination, definition, and popular history, in effect invites students to create and market a “modernist” text, thereby illustrating how modernism existed across avant-garde and popular spheres alike (to pick up the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gatsby</span> example again, the book was filmed as early as in 1926 and reprinted the same year in the pulp magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Famous Story</span>). By recreating the scene of modernist creation within a virtual medium, students learn to navigate the three temporal dynamics of modernist definition: its initial scene (“what was modernism?”), the New Critical imposition of a cohesive definition (“how was this scene constructed or defined by academia?”), and our current moment of rediscovery and revision (“how are we redefining modernism(s) now?”). I find that one of the greatest challenges of teaching modernism is exactly this negotiation between past and present concepts of the movement: a reinvention that also entails a return to the old dynamics.
    </p>
<p>
      Influenced by (among others) Pater’s call for art to aspire to the dynamics of music, Conrad’s aim to make the reader “see,” Marinetti’s push for explosive typography, and Eugene Jolas and Bob Brown’s call in <span style="font-style:italic;">transition</span> to revolutionize the word, modernist writers aspired to a multi-dimensional form of creativity and reception that taught their audience new strategies for active reading. Similarly, as Catherine McLoughlin and Mark Lee have pointed out, the participatory information-sharing that characterizes today’s World Wide Web (Web 2.0, as it is called) has redefined the idea of audience as passive.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> By introducing “more flexible, dynamic, and interactive notions of the respective roles of author and reader,” notes Dana Wilber, social networking sites such as wikis, blogs, and MySpace create “new, multiple literacies,”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> or what Carey Jewitt and Gunther Kress describe as “multi-modal literacies.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Thus the pedagogy of the MySpace project mimics as well as illuminates modernism, opening up literary texts to the multi-modal semiotics of visuality, orality, aurality, and popular and artistic culture.
    </p>
<p>
      While the use of such a corporate and advertising-driven engine as MySpace might trouble some academics, the feeling of disquiet that surrounds modernism’s corporate involvement (and that worries Michael Sayeau in his teaching project, described below) is in fact central to this assignment. The students’ role-playing as authors and modernist impresarios makes them aware of how modernists were “selling” new ideas and also  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> allows the consideration (albeit in a more subtle manner) of how elements of modernism and the discipline of English Studies constructed their own reputation. I believe that this self-marketing should be central to our concept of modernism, not just in our scholarship, but in our teaching as well.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> As researchers, modernist scholars continually seek to trouble the great divide: what Andreas Huyssen described as modernism’s antagonistic relationship to popular culture. Likewise, our goal as teachers should be not to police the borders of an elitist literature, but to explode them: to advertise, democratize, market, and make modernism consumable to our audience.
