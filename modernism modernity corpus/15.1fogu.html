<p id="lead">"In the golden years of rationalist architecture, Mediterranean-ness became our polar star" (Carlo Belli, cited in Danesi, 25). Thus architectural and art critic Belli recalled in 1976 the key role that the idea of <i>mediterraneità </i>(Mediterranean-ness) had come to play for both avant-garde Italian artists and rationalist architects in the early 1930s. Whether identified with a modern sense of the "<i>classic</i>" intended as an art of "intimacy cum narrative depth"—which accommodated equally the abstractism of Milanese painters, the "scuola Romana" of Giuseppe Capogrossi, Emanuele Cavalli e Corrado Cagli, and "les Italiens de Paris" united around Giorgio De Chirico—or with the "solar-ness" of Italian-rationalist architecture, Mediterranean-ness became the most effective line of defense in the Italian-modernist town (Vescovo 24). It allowed Italian modernists under Fascism to unify around a common discursive strategy in order to simultaneously distinguish themselves from their Northern European rivals, and to fence off the increasingly worrisome accusations of <i>esterofilia</i> (love of everything foreign) levied against them by the ever more vocal proponents of an official fascist style responding to the idea of <i>romanità </i>(ancient Roman-ness) (Benzi 30).  </p>

<p>Already between 1928 and 1929, Italian emigré painters in Paris, from the ex-futurist Gino Severini to the <i>sui generis novecentisti</i> Massimo Campigli and Filippo De Pisis, gathered around De Chirico, father of the most intuitively Mediterranean style in painting (metafisica), to combine "magical realism" and "abstract classicism" in order to create a Mediterranean alternative to the Surrealist "appeals to the unconscious, unexplored lands, and elementary forces"(Benzi 31).Similarly, in 1931, 



 the rationalist architects known as <i>Gruppo 7</i> began their polemic against the "cold rationalism" and "socialistic" tendencies of Bauhaus architecture, opposing to it the "solar" and "spontaneous" rationalism of Southern Italian and Greek islands architecture (Danesi 25). Pointing to the geographical consistency of the connection between sun, Mediterranean sea, and white walls-architecture, and linking it to the diachronic consistency of climate and natural landscape across the Mediterranean area, the adherents to the most foreign-inspired modernist trend—rationalist architecture—could thus construct, <i>a posteriori</i>, a most convenient national-natural foundation for their daring architectural choices. Modern architecture was projected to be a natural outgrowth <i>of</i> Mediterranean climate and that had always been there in the combination of solar whiteness and <i>sezione aurea</i> (Golden section), characterizing even the so-called spontaneous architecture of Mediterranean islands. But was <i>mediterraneità </i>anything more than a politically convenient strategy for carving a vital space for the avant-garde under Fascism, while at the same time continuing to feed the cultural mill of <i>Italian-ness</i>? Did, for example, Malaparte-Libera's architectural masterpiece in Capri, or the <i>villa Oro</i> (Golden villa) by Luigi Cosenza in Naples, share substantial traits with both the centuries-old spontaneous architecture of the Corricella harbor in the island of Procida and the "marine landscapes" that became a statistically relevant reality of Italian-modernist painting in the second half of the 1930s? (Vescovo 20). </p>

<p> To these questions, Belli's friend Edoardo Persico responded throughout the 1930s from the pages of the influential journal <i>Casabella</i> with a resounding "no." For Persico the idea of <i>mediterraneità </i>was as vague, rhetorical, and banal as its more official and conservative counterparts such as <i>romanità, latinità, italianità. </i>Worse still, a serious brand of Latin-Mediterranean modernist architecture existed, but not in Italy. It was, of course, Le Corbusier's (Danesi 25). Surely Persico's opinion was just one. But even if one were to connect more architectural and artistic dots than he was prepared to recognize as avant-garde, would the <i>mediterraneità </i>of Italian rationalism and metafisica amount to much more than a certain suggestion of the naturalness of the classic, an idea of natural purity distilled from the sea and bathed in light, an abstract genealogy without the burden of history? Where, in other words, was the "modern" element in this Mediterranean-ness? This question was never addressed by Persico, nor by champions of Mediterranean-ness such as Rava and Belli, nor has it been pursued by later historians, maybe because the answer lies elsewhere from where <i>mediterraneità </i>was discursively constructed or opposed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Maybe—this is the suggestion this paper will make—<i> mediterraneità</i> had been an improbable part of the avant-garde, least likely to elaborate a Mediterranean imaginary: Marinetti's Futurism. </p>

<p>At first sight nothing could be conceived as more antithetical to <i>mediterraneità </i>than a movement with its center in the northern cities of Milan and Paris, one made of <i>modernolatria</i> (idolatry of modernity) and using the destruction of all forms of <i>passatismo </i>(past-ism) as its battle-cries for over three decades of cultural activity. Yet, we could begin by noting that Futurism's undisputed leader, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, was born in the quintessentially Mediterranean city of Alexandria, Egypt, that he once 

<b></b>

 affirmed that he felt more "Neapolitan" than Italian, that he spent long periods of time on the island of Capri, in front of Naples, and that the first futurist manifesto was published in Naples four days before it appeared in <i>Le ro</i>. Coupled with the capillary dissemination that Futurism achieved in Southern Italy in the interwar period, these facts about Marinetti's biography have led scholars such as Claudia Salaris to propose that, in time, the Mediterranean came to constitute the counter-polarity to the "idolatry of modernity" and "destructive tendencies" characteristic of early futurism, thereby allowing the movement to acquire a more "solar" (or sun-inspired) and "constructive" character in the 1920s and '30s .<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  For Salaris, then, Futurism came to share the same passion for the solar oriented that united the modernist chorus singing the praises of <i>mediterraneità </i>under Fascism. </p>

<p>This article wishes to expand upon Solaris's pioneering work by highlighting some key contributions by Southern Italian futurists to the development of the movement before and during fascism, by reframing such polarities as those of a Northern-destructive avant-garde phase in the 1910s and a Southern-constructive one in the 1920s and '30s. I wish to propose, first, that instead of invoking successive spatial-temporal phases, we should think of this polarity as constitutive and as internal to a Mediterranean imaginary that Futurism developed from its inception and nourished until its very end. This is attested to by the founding of the journal <i>Mediterraneo futurista</i> as late as 1938. Second, I want to show that this polarity should not be identified with culturalized nature as in the customary opposition of a solar-constructive South over and against a cold-destructive North. Instead it should be thought of as a transration of the Latin notions of <i>emporium</i> and <i>imperium</i>. </p>

<p>Rather than referring to something essentially or naturally Mediterranean, these terms denoted the Mediterranean as a quintessentially urban space, and simultaneously connoted it as a civilization characterized by exchange- and impact-driven modes of encounter with the other.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Originally, the Latin <i>Emporium </i>translated the Greek term <i>emporion</i>, which was the general term designating colonial trading posts that Greek city-states had established along the Mediterranean coasts. In Roman times, however, <i>emporium</i> expanded to designate new trading towns built not only along the Mediterranean coast, but also on the banks of rivers that connected the Mediterranean to the interior lands of the Empire. <i>Emporium</i> also comprised larger cities established for the specific purpose of trading. It thus captured the idea that the cultural continuity in Greco-Roman civilization was centered on a metaphorical trans-regional expansion of medi-terranean-ness—literally 'in between lands'—rather than just designating a purely maritime space of exploration and settlement. In this way, <i>emporium</i> came to signify the centrality of exchange and the in-between-ness of land and sea in the Roman Empire. In fact, in Roman times, the term '<i>mediterraneaum</i>' was used only as an adjective to indicate 'being in the middle of lands' while the sea we call the Mediterranean was instead called <i>mare magnum, mare nostrum, mare internum, </i>or <i>mare intestium</i>.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Similarly, the idea of Roman <i>imperium</i> had expanded from a temporary military title in Republican Rome to become the idea that Rome ruled the Mediterranean space more by the attraction it exercised over conquered people to become culturally Roman, than by brute coercion.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Futurism, of course, did not seek to conquer lands or establish trading posts, nor did it claim any Roman ancestry, but its cultural politics oscillate between the imaginary poles of <i>emporium </i>and <i>imperium</i>, precisely because these notions not only restore a certain historical depth to the futurist imaginary; these two terms also suggest that a deep level of resonance between futurist and fascist imaginaries was in place from the beginning of the movement prior to involvement in the Great War. The search for an <i>imperium</i> expanding over the cultural field of the avant-garde can thus be seen as connecting Futurist "rhetorics of virility"—to use Barbara Spackman's fortunate phrase —with <i>modernolatria</i> (idolatry of the machine-age) and the love of war, "the world's sole hygiene." The latter slogan used by Marinetti and company identified the futurists not only with a three-pronged cultural struggle against all forms of <i>passatismo</i> (passeism), but also with the Italian right to seek Great Nation status by building a Mediterranean Empire after Mussolini's ascent to power (Gentile 47). On the other hand, the futurist drive towards <i>emporium</i> is eloquently exemplified by the unique projection of this movement towards breaking down all barriers and opening up exchange between avant-garde aesthetics and mass media communication, as well as between high art and commercial-art expressions under Fascism. Yet, what is most remarkable and least obvious is that the very formation of this imaginary polarity between <i>emporium </i>and <i>imperium </i>belongs to the earliest phase of the movement's history, in particular, to the poetic work of Marinetti. </p>

<p>As is well known, the announced birth of Futurism by Marinetti in <i>Mafarka </i> and the founding <i>Manifesto </i>of 1910 remained without a proper poetic theorization or realization, until a series of three manifestos for over two years: the <i>Manifesto tecnico della letteratura futurista </i>(Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature) in 1912, <i>Immaginazione senza fili. Distruzione della sintassi. Parole in libertà </i>(Imagination without Wires. Destruction of Syntax. Words in Freedom) in 1913, and <i>Lo Splendore geometrico e meccanico e la sensibilità numerica </i>(Geometrical and Mechanical Splendor and the Numerical Sensibility) in 1914. These declarations defined for the whole movement the connections between the liberation of poetic language from syntax, and the abolition of the poetic "I" in favor of a poetry dominated by unbridled chains of analogies, along with the sensory charging of the sign with visual, aural and even tactile resonances. Furthermore, in each of these manifestos, Marinetti presented the futurist revolution in poetics as the expression of a dynamism and simultaneity intrinsic to the experience of modernity, and, hence, as the mark of distinction of futurism from all other avant-gardes. Yet, a look at the first and most well known expression of Marinetti's words in freedom, <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum,</i> composed in 1912 and published in 1914, reveals that the connection between futurism, modernity, and the destruction of syntax theorized in Marinetti's manifestos on poetry, owed as much to the imagery of Mediterranean-ness as to that of the machine or of masculine self-generation.  </p>

<p>In <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum</i> futurist poetry is not "BORN" of a phallic self-generation, as in <i>Mafarka</i>, or from a car crash, as in the first manifesto, but during a slow train ride through Southern Italy (Calabria and Sicily) somewhere between the devastating earthquake of Messina and the "petrified lava" of the Etna (<i>Selected Poems</i> 57–59). 

<b></b>

 In this key respect, <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum </i>recorded an evolution of Marinetti's poetic that can best be seen by looking at Marinetti's early texts such as "La Conquête des Étoiles" (The Conquest of the Stars<i>, </i>1902) and "Destruction" (Destruction<i>, </i>1903), and comparing them to his last pre-words-in-freedom text, "Le Monoplan du Pape" (The Pope's Monoplane<i>,</i> 1912). While in the first composition the poet invokes "the Sovereign Sea" (<i>Selected Poems</i> 13) and in the second the "Almighty Sea" (<i>Selected Poems</i> 21) to deliver his poetic language from its enslavement "to the ideal," the free verses of "The Pope's Monoplane" allow him to encounter from on high "the Dark African wind" and engage—for over twenty pages—in an imaginary duel with the Sicilian Volcano Etna while flying, to quote Marinetti: "Over Sicily, the New Heart of Italy" (<i>Selected Poems</i>, 48).  </p>

<p>At the level of imagery, then, <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum</i> was both continuous with Marinetti's pre-futurist work and registered an evolution in the Futurist imaginary that had been long in the making, that was no longer centered on the sea but on the volcano as the principal cipher of Mediterranean-ness and key poetic analog of futurist poetics. In fact, within a year from the publication of <i>Zang Tumb Tuuum</i>, Marinetti would make the analogy even more clear by speaking of Futurism as "that great mass of incandescent metals that we have extracted with our bare hands from the depths of a volcano" (<i>Teoria e invenzione</i> 267). Entering the futurist universe in 1912, the image of the volcano thus came to iconize the<i> imperium </i>pole of futurist Mediterranean-ness and flourished well into the 1920s as evident in Marinetti's 1927 play "Prigionieri e vulcani" ("Prisoners and Volcanoes") and the 1929 futurist journal <i>Vulcani</i>. In the process, however, the geographical center of futurist imaginary gradually shifted from the Sicilian Etna to the Neapolitan Vesuvius, as graphically testified by the words-in-freedom portraits of Marinetti and the Neapolitan poet, Francesco Cangiullo, published by Marietta Angelini in the Neapolitan review <i>Vela Latina</i> in 1918 [<a href="#1">res 1</a> &amp; 2]. Aside from identifying Marinetti as a "Vesuvian brain," this double portrait captured the deeper process of "Neapolitanization"—to cite Ardenigo Soffici's polemical definition—that Futurism and its leader had undergone during the war-years.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This is not the place for a discussion of the recurrent tensions between Northern and Southern futurists, and the recurring distinction between <i>marinettismo</i> and <i>futurismo</i> resulting from splintering factions in the movement. But, we should not hesitate to recognize that Soffici's disparaging comment contained an undeniable kernel of truth. Between 1912 and 1916 the friendship, patronage, and collaboration between Marinetti and the young Neapolitan poet Francesco Cangiullo had grown beyond all proportions and the understanding of most futurists.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In fact, numerous references to Cangiullo appear in key manifestos by Marinetti, such as the "Manifesto del teatro di varietà" ("Manifesto of the Variety Theatre," 1913), the "Manifesto della recitazione sinottica e dinamica" ("Manifesto of Synoptic and Dynamic Recitation," 1916), and the "Manifesto del teatro della sorpresa" ("Manifesto of the Theatre of Surprise," 1924). These statements chart Marinetti's genuine and strategic turn away from reconnecting words in freedom to the <i>lyrical </i>and the <i>poetic </i>as advocated by Soffici, and mark his move instead towards the "contamination" of futurist poetics with forms of popular culture absorbed primarily from Southern Italy.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>Marinetti visited Naples for the first time in 1908, but it was not until 1910 that he encountered there the younger poet Francesco Cangiullo.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  As we shall see in a moment, the gravitation of Futurism from <i>imperium </i>towards <i>emporium</i> owed much to the friendship between Marinetti and Cangiullo and the impact of the latter on his <i>maestro </i>as well as the whole movement. At first, though, this friendship also meant for Marinetti a personal involvement with Naples that led him to visit the island of Capri in 1914, and later to choose it for his honeymoon site with Benedetta.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The encounter with Capri produced its most direct poetic effects in the development of Marinetti's erotic novels, a genre that would comprise not only the many narrations of Marinetti's conquests of women in <i>Come si seducono le donne</i> (<i>How to Seduce Women</i>) of 1916, <i>L'alcova d'acciaio </i>(<i>The Steel Alcove</i>) of 1921, and <i>Scatole d'amore in conserva</i> (<i>Love in Tin Cans</i>) of 1927, but also<i> L'isola dei baci </i>(<i>The Island of Kisses</i>), an "erotic-social" novel, written with Bruno Corra in 1918. This novel takes place entirely in Capri, but, rather than focusing on Marinetti's conquests, it stages a confrontation between the futurist poet and the homosexual members of the "Pink Congress." In the text, Pink Congress is identified with all the typical crimes of <i>passatismo</i>: from the pacifist condemnation of war, to the call for full financing of archeological digs, to the "establishment of Schools of Slowness, Indecision, and Delicacy in order to heal humanity from the pest of Speed".  </p>

<p>Surely the novel's antigay sarcasm demonstrates the perfect harmony between futurist rhetorics of virility and the Mediterranean imaginary that Futurism was forging 

<b></b>

 during the war years. But, more to the point, the novel staged the Pink Congress in the "mellifluous" and "picturesque" waters of the blue grotto, while identifying the poet, "wearing his grey-green uniform" with the island's "volcanic rocks" that reminded him of the war theatre of the "Carso" . In so doing, <i>L'isola dei baci</i> effectively reified the evolution of futurist poetics described above into a polarization between past-loving sea and futurist lava. The analogical chain of associations linking Futurism to volcanoes, to Vesuvius, to volcanic rocks, and to the manly seduction of women, thus found its war-like completion in the image of Capri-Carso. It would therefore be but a small step for Marinetti to describe the island in a perfect <i>imperium </i>style as a "geological and plastic summary of our peninsula and race," and as "a piece of that volcanic peer that once connected Europe to Africa"  in a 1922 keynote address at a conference held in Capri. While capping the metaphorical expansion of a futurist <i>imperium</i> by identifying futurists with the whole Italian race, this image anticipated Mussolini's famous description of the Italian peninsula, on the eve of the Ethiopian campaign, as a natural aircraft carrier projected towards the Northern shores of Mediterranean Africa. And yet, it is in this same 1922 text that we can also capture the traces of a futurist imaginary seeking to counterbalance its own drive toward <i>imperium </i>with a more open attitude of <i>emporium</i>, that is, one featuring an active engagement with and transration of popular forms of Mediterranean culture. </p>

<p>Having developed the analogical chain of Capri-Italy-Futurism by identifying the island's rocks as "Italian," that is, "rebellious, lyrical, and revolutionary like futurist art," Marinetti proceeded to present the island as a "<i>varietà</i>" (a variety theatre), in which the natural elements (the sun, the rocks, the moon, the sea) "mimicked" futurist paintings, theatre, and poetry (36–40). Far from being merely casual, this image of Capri-<i>varietà </i>gestured explicitly towards the key contribution of Neapolitan Futurism to the transration of the Variety Theatre into a futurist Theatre of Surprise. Marinetti had explicitly praised the variety theatre in a manifesto published in 1913, which began by exalting the Parisian tradition of variety theatres, and explicitly that of the <i>Folies-Bergère,</i> for all the usual futurist reasons: its dynamism, <i>antipassatismo</i>, and anticipation of the futurist sensibility destined to become dominant. In the last part of the manifesto, however, Marinetti had prescribed the need for Futurism to "destroy all logic in variety spectacles" and "abolish the Parisian <i>Revues</i>" by introducing "surprise effect[s]" (88–89). In this way, the "Manifesto del teatro di varietà" had registered the theorization of the principle of <i>la trovata</i> (surprise effect) in Francesco Cangiullo's poetic work of 1912–1913. It also anticipated the application of this effect to the theatre by Cangiullo and Marinetti themselves in the "Manifesto del Teatro della Sorpresa" published just a few months before Marinetti's keynote speech in Capri.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The composite image of Capri-Futurism-<i>teatro di varietà</i> thus pointed to a new and very different analogic series from that of Futurism-war-Carso projected by <i>L'isola dei baci</i>. It identified Futurism with the absorption of the popular-cultural heritage of the Neapolitan <i>trovata</i>. </p>

<p>In so doing, it also registered the impact of Marinetti's intense collaboration with Cangiullo during and immediately after the war. This collaboration had begun in 

<b></b>

 1910 with Cangiullo's participation in the first futurist soirée in Naples. From that date onwards, Cangiullo had become Marinetti's man in Naples as well as one of the most active animators of the futurist soirées.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Cangiullo's pre-futurist experience as a composer of Neapolitan pop songs, musical motifs for the lively café-chantants of the city, and as a creator of comic sketches for the local variety theatres put him in an ideal position to create an osmotic channel of communication between the "high" art of futurist avant-gardism and the "low" culture of Neapolitan gesticulation, scurrility, and crass humor.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  As a consequence of this role, Cangiullo has remained a somewhat belittled re in the movement, suffering from the negative judgment of temporary futurists such as Soffici, who regarded him as a major danger to Futurism, and as the principal cause for Marinetti's betrayal of the movement.  </p>

<p>To be sure, authoritative scholars such as John White and Willard Bohn have rendered justice more recently to the originality of Cangiullo's contributions to the development of futurist visual poetry, while making his poetic work known to the English-speaking public.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  But although Cangiullo's poetic compositions <i>Piedigrotta </i>, <i>Caffeconcerto: alfabeto a sorpresa</i> (The Surprise Alphabet<i>, </i>1916), and <i>Poesia Pentagrammata</i> (Pentagrammatical Poem, 1918) were important for pushing futurist poetics towards their pictorial and onomatopoeic limits, the historical role played by Cangiullo in the evolution of the whole movement has remained largely unexplored. This oversight may have been caused by the fact that Canguillo's role has not been fully appreciated through synthetically assessing his activities as theatrical playwright, impresario, and theoretician after the war.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In 1921, Cangiullo set up a futurist theatrical company designed to perform a whole new style of futurist theatre, which Cangiullo called <i>Teatro della sorpresa </i>(Theatre of Surprise) and theorized in the homonymous manifesto written with Marinetti in the same year. Among all of the futurist manifestos, this document may be one of the most remarkable for its theoretical insights. Marinetti-Cangiullo began by expanding the scope of the manifesto of Variety Theatre through proposing that the highest value for a work of art was its "surprise value," that is, "the effect of wonder produced by the first viewing of a painting or a fresco." This value, they claimed, was clearly the highest one for both artists and patrons in the past, if "as we all know, so many frescoes and paintings were covered up by new ones because they had lost their surprise value" due to both "ritual" viewing and "reproduction" in different media.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  In this day and age, the authors continued, it has become so difficult to surprise people due to the multiplication of reproductive techniques, that a "theatre of surprise" may be needed simply to reintroduce surprise value in our lives.  </p>

<p>Marinetti and Cangiullo then spelled out the combined three goals of the theatre of surprise as follows: first, to conceive of "surprise" always in a specific relation to the audience encountered; second, to organize the performance in such a way as to produce a concatenation of comical ideas that would draw the audience into the spectacle; and, finally, to extend the surprise effect into the streets of the city. Most importantly, the primary goal of the futurist theatre of surprise was to bring together and to mix popular forms of entertainment, such as "magicians," "illusionists," and "athletes" with 

<b></b>

 all forms of futurist art: from the performance of synthetic theatrical pieces, to the synoptic declamations of poetry, to the exhibition of painting and sculptures, to the distribution among the audience of the "tactile tables" just invented by Marinetti, to the improvisation of "musical dialogues between two pianos," and even to the inclusion of a "theatrical news section on futurist activities" . </p>

<p>Clearly, in the <i>Teatro della Sorpresa</i> we encounter a proper futurist <i>emporium</i>: a warehousing of the popular art form of the Neapolitan <i>varietà</i> that absorbs futurist art-forms and gives them a proper space of commercial exhibition, while at the same time enacting all the prescriptions that Marinetti had wished for in the manifesto of the Variety Theatre, including the gluing of chairs and the selling of ten tickets per seat.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Unfortunately, however, over ten years after its explosion upon the stage of the avant-garde, Futurism was no longer a novelty, and its capacity to surprise was very limited indeed. As the surviving chronicles and other texts about these novel futurist soirées amply testify, the "surprise value" of the theatrical pieces was more often than not ridiculed by both audience and critics.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  To give just an example, the two pieces of which Cangiullo was most proud were entitled "Non c'è un Cane" ("There is Not Even a Dog Here"), and "Luce" ("Light"). In both pieces, the <i>trovata</i> consisted in representing the gap between the literal and the idiomatic value of their titles: in the former, a dog was made to cross the stage from right to left, and then the curtain was dropped. In Italian, however, "<i>there is not even a dog here</i>" means "nobody is there"—the joke-<i>trovata</i> being that in fact a dog was on stage, however briefly! As for "Luce," this was the exclamation that one would sometime hear in a theatre at the beginning of a theatrical performance or film if management forgot to turn off the lights. Cangiullo's piece entailed a completely darkened theatre and, after a good ten minutes, if the audience had not done it yet, a couple of actors in the audience starting to shout "light." As the shouting multiplied over several minutes and reached a climax, suddenly the lights on the stage would be turned on and after a minute the curtain would come down . . . amidst further shouts of the audience asking for their money back. </p>

<p>Whether written by Cangiullo or Marinetti, these surprise pieces amounted to little more than smart plays on idiomatic expressions, and, what's worse, their reproduction in the chronicles of the newspapers destroyed their surprise value altogether. Within a few weeks after the first performance, almost everybody in Italy knew that members of the orchestra would sit among the audience, that a few members of the audience would be sold the same seat in the theatre so as to initiate a rouse, and that at least one seat in the theatre would be spread with glue. Newspapers even reported that the first ten rows of the theatres were always empty because people knew part of the action would take place there, and sought to reinstate the barrier between actors and audience. But, predictably, the value of this form of theatre did not reside for Marinetti and company in its adherence to its manifesto, nor in its ability to truly surprise its audience.  </p>

<p>It was the cultural <i>lowering </i>of the <i>high-sounding</i> Marinetti-Futurism that the audience came to watch. In this form of theatre, it was the audience that played the part of the provocateur, often preventing the actors from finishing their synthetic acts, and, at the end of the spectacle, waiting for them outside to escort them to their hotel, thereby 

<b></b>

 offering a self-conscious and original rendition of the third principle of the theatre of surprise. Rather than breaking the boundaries between actors and audience, the theatre of surprise ended up inverting their places, with the latter, acting according to a script written in the pages of the newspapers. For the Futurists, however, a series of more important consolations were in store. In the first place, thanks to the "surprise" of doubling the prices for the third gallery seats, and offering the best seats at half price, these futurist spectacles did manage to break even and had an impact on the social composition of the audience by democratizing it. Second, unlike the evenings of the 1910s, the theatrical evenings of the surprise theatre were generally attended by an audience that while booing and even coming to blows with the futurists, remained until the end of the spectacle, or beyond. In such a futurist <i>emporium,</i> there would always be something that in the end each spectator would appreciate.  </p>

<p>Cangiullo's <i>Teatro della sorpresa</i> lasted only two years, but remarkably, Marinetti attended every single performance, knowing full well that his presence was the key to electrify the atmosphere. It is not without its sad tinge of irony that at the end of the second tournée, in 1924, Cangiullo would not only leave the company but also publicly dissociate himself from Futurism, because he believed that the movement had exhausted its "surprise value."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The irony—not lost on Cangiullo who reconnected with Marinetti in the mid-1930s—was that by 1924 the Cangiullian principle of the <i>trovata</i> had made its mark on the whole of Futurism, especially on that part of the movement that was bent on destroying the boundary between high art and mass communication, especially on the Calabrian futurist Enzo Benedetto, who translated Cangiullo's idea into a manifesto entitled "L'arte della reclame" ("The Art of Advertizing"). In "L'Arte della reclame" Benedetto argued that the bourgeois era of the painting had ended and was being replaced by that of the advertising poster. This, however, he considered a much higher form of art than the former, because "while [painting] depended only on the inspiration of the artist," the latter was much harder because "dependant on a commission and the ability of the artist to translate it into a <i>trovata,</i>" a surprise effect . Although no futurist painter ever abandoned completely the easel for the street wall, Benedetto's manifesto on behalf of the advertising poster correctly interpreted the commercial road towards <i>emporium</i> that most futurists had embarked upon in the early 1930s when the avant-garde status and revolutionary zeal of the movement had long been exhausted, even as <i>mediterraneità </i>had become the common discursive denominator for all modernist movements.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In fact, with the growth of the anti-modernist fascist front in the mid-1930s, <i>mediterraneità </i>had not only become an ideological point of conjunction across the whole fascist-modernist spectrum in Italy, but also its own aesthetic form of expression in what we can properly term "exhibition art." </p>

<p>Fascism of course did not invent the art of designing thematic exhibitions, nor did it develop a specifically "Mediterranean" exhibition-style. But as Marla Stone has documented, in the 1930s Fascism gave more space and attention to the organization of mass cultural exhibitions than any other regime either democratic or totalitarian ever did . In addition, exhibitions came to counterbalance the excessive ritualization of public life in the second half of the decade.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The exhibition of every aspect of 

<b></b>

 the socio-economic workings of the corporate state—from the extraction and use of Italian minerals to the establishment of summer camps for children—represented for the regime much more than a means of propaganda. Fascist exhibitions hardly aimed at solidifying consensus or collective identity, but rather at stimulating an ever-waning enthusiasm by seeking to communicate to the visitor a synaesthetic feeling of absolute <i>distinction</i> directly derived from futurist poetics of virility.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  On the other hand, the extraordinary effort poured by the regime into this area triggered a veritable boom in commercial fairs, or emporia with exhibitions dedicated to every aspect of design and exhibition culture itself. By the mid-1930s, Italian modernist artists and architects spent most or their time and talent designing pavilions, advertising campaigns, and commodities.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  And here, in the commercialized exhibition form <i>per se</i>, the Mediterranean imaginary cultivated by the whole modernist front under Fascism, found the perfect means to bring together <i>imperium </i>and <i>emporium</i>, to recall the words of influential architecture critic Mario Pagano.  </p>

<p>Writing in the special number of his journal, <i>Casabella</i>, dedicated to a comparison between Italian and European exhibition-culture, Pagano—who was anything but an uncritical sponsor of Italian-ness—affirmed that Italian exhibition-art had bypassed all others in Europe because it had accomplished "a futurist synthesis of novecentismo and razionalismo," which consisted in bringing together two apparently contradictory tendencies . On the one hand, under Fascism, exhibitions had been entrusted to the vision of single "architect-painters," who expressed the idea of <i>imperium</i> through the "exaltation of 'pure' values that ignore practical considerations in order to attempt an affirmation of style in the most lyrical sense of the word" . On the other hand, Pagano added, this idea of "style" without adjectives had expressed itself in the commodified <i>emporium</i> field of "advertisement architecture" much better than in the political exhibitions organized by the regime. Thus, writing retrospectively in 1941, Pagano favorably compared the futurist-rationalist experimentations in purely <i>emporium</i> exhibitions such as the <i>Mostra nazionale della moda </i>(National Exhibition of Fashion, 1933) or the <i>Mostra del poster e della pubblicità commerciale </i>(Exhibition of the Poster and the Commercial Advertisement, 1936), to the more compromised and rhetorical collaborations in those exhibitions, such as the <i>Mostra augustea della romanità </i>(Exhibition of Augustus's Rome, 1937) in which the regime had explicitly celebrated its right to <i>imperium</i>. And yet, it was precisely in the last political exhibition, the <i>Mostra delle terre d'oltremare </i>(Exhibition of African Colonies) organized by the regime in Naples in 1940, that we can find the most mature expression of Futurism's Mediterranean imaginary. </p>

<p>The intentions of the fascist Party, which initially commissioned it, the <i>Mostra delle terre d'oltremare </i>(MTO) were to celebrate the fascist Empire, through a display of both historical and symbolic effects that would trace the Italian right to <i>imperium </i>from Roman times to the present. The architectural prominence of the PNF tower and the six pavilions dedicated to the documentation of the Italian expansion in the Mediterranean were an eloquent reminder of these intentions [<a href="#3">re 3</a>]. </p>

<p>But, if one compares the actual space covered by the permanent-symbolic installations—sixty rooms in total—with the one hundred and fifty temporary or semi-permanent 

<b></b>

 installations aimed at documenting the economic activities connected to this expansion throughout Italy and the <i>terre d'oltremare</i> (a euphemism for Italian colonies), the impression one receives is instructive. It becomes apparent that this exhibition was much closer to the <i>Fiere del levante, </i>the commercial fairs held annually in Bari, than to political events such as the Autarchic exhibition of Italian minerals held the year before in Rome.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In other words, an exhibition that was explicitly aimed at celebrating and legitimizing the Roman origins of fascist <i>imperium</i>, ended up documenting Fascism's debt to the commodity-bound Mediterranean imaginary cultivated by Futurism for over two decades. It was in fact in its overall design that the MTO came to express and consolidate the futurist notion of Mediterranean-ness in the arrangement of an "architettura a sorpresa" (surprise architecture) in which the organizers themselves identified explicitly the guiding criterion of the exhibition's aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> </p>

<p>It is surprising how the official architectural style of the regime, <i>stile littorio</i>, which dominated the entrance to the expo, gave way in the surrounding areas to a mixture of architectural styles without precedent in the history of regime exhibitions.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  These ranged from the daring rationalist theater of masses designed by the twenty-six year old Neapolitan architect Giulio De Luca [<a href="#4">re 4</a>] to the orientalist "Marco Polo Tower" designed by Vittorio Calza Bini [<a href="#5">re 5</a>].  </p>

<p>Also surprising were the number of pavilions  dedicated to all aspects of Mediterranean production and consumption that were built behind the symbolic center of the exhibition by another young Neapolitan architect, Stefania Filo Speziale. Among them was the celebrated pavilion dedicated to the electrotechnical industry decorated by futurist master Enrico Prampolini [<a href="#6">re 6</a>]. In addition, there were purely <i>emporium </i>pavilions, such as, the "Torre pubblicitaria" (advertising tower), and the other two towers that contained the exhibition of fashion, and one of tourism. Above all, however,

<p class="continued">

 the surprise effect was captured in the urban planning of the exhibition itself, which envisioned an entertainment park, a zoo with several green areas and houses, and a spectacular <i>funicolare</i>—suspended cable-car—connecting the MTO with the top of Naples' Posillipo hill [<a href="#7">re 7</a>]. </p>

<p>Much more like a theme-park or a modern mall than a thematic exhibition, the whole planning of the MTO was dominated by a concern for the valorization of the tourist potential of the area in which it was built—hence the <i>funicolare</i>, the terrace on top of the PNF tower, and the restaurant-Olympic swimming-pool complex designed by Naples' foremost futurist master, Carlo Cocchia. Alongside the "international" commercial input, however, stood also the discordant desire to offer a <i>una faccia una razza</i> (one face one race) and an <i>Italiani brava gente</i> (Italians, good folks) version of fascist colonization.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Hence there were innumerable ethnic spectacles of African dances and music, and the ever present delegations of imperial subjects in local costume roaming around the exhibition, in order to produce in the visitor a "living experience of the Mediterranean man"—as an advertising pamphlet put it.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The MTO, we might summarize, adapted Marinetti's image of Capri as a geological bridge between Europe and Africa to the whole Italian peninsula, thereby projecting the notion of the fascist Mediterranean as both an extension of the fatherland—one destined to live and die with it—and an hinterland between the real north and the deep African south to which the exhibition dedicated various pavilions. At least, this seems the message we still receive today from the only surviving decoration of the exhibition: Prampolini's plaster mural situated on the north side of Cocchia's restaurant. This work literalized and simultaneously inverted Marinetti's image of Capri as a "piece of that peer that once connected Europe to Africa" by shaping the African continent—represented to the left of the quintessentially Mediterranean image of dancing natives, white and black—as the Capri he had loved and depicted over and over in the 1920s [Compare res <a href="#8">8</a> and <a href="#9">9</a>]. </p>

<p>In identifying Africa with Capri, Prampolini closed the analogic chain of Mediterranean links that Marinetti initiated in his early poetry, at last, identifying <i>imperium </i>with <i>emporium</i>. It would be misleading, though, to read in this picture any conscious or latent anti-imperialist message. And yet, one cannot escape the impression that it not only summarized the Mediterranean imaginary that Futurism cultivated before and during the regime, but also foreshadowed its survival into the postcolonial culture that in the postwar era has constructed Italy as the emporium of Mediterranean-ness.
