<p>Modernity, of course, has no single meaning, not even in one location. This polylogue—constructed collaboratively with colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison—voices particular views shaped by different planetary positionalities.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Globally and locally, modernity appears infinitely expandable. Listening to these diverse voices, reading their scripts, I despair—especially for the new scholar just entering the field of dreams, a Tower of Babel with too many levels to climb; but also for the older scholar, trained in the old modernist studies: vertigo out on a limb, whirled up into a vortex of the new. Yet I also rejoice. Change is what drew me to modernism in the beginning. Why should it ossify? Why should the fluid freeze over, the undecidable become decided?</p>
<p>All that is solid melts into air.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> We know that. Why should we want a stability for the field that the modernists themselves rebelled against? Caught in the polylogue, we are in the thick of things. At the level of scholarship and teaching we inhabit what it is we study. As W. B. Yeats asks, "How can we know the dancer from the dance?"<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> We are participating in what we study, and we should not be apologetic about it. This is a planetary epistemology of modernity, of modernism.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The New Modernist Studies: Expansion and Containment</h1>
<p>In their 2008 overview of the "new" modernist studies in <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> Douglas Mao and Rebecca L. Walkowitz characterize the field's expansions along three major axes—the temporal, horizontal, and vertical, by which they mean the growing historical and geographical reach of modernist studies as well as the dissolution of divisions between high and low art and culture.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Jennifer Wicke has dubbed the field's making itself new a form of rebranding, a commodification of the field that ensures our own complicity in the logic of globalization.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Disciplining Modernism</span>, Pamela L. Caughie asks whether modernism can or should be contained and if so, what would be the ethics/politics of such "disciplining"?<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> We wonder, have the field's boundaries become so boundless as to incorporate everything and thus lose all definitional cogency or analytic utility? Does this rebranding exhibit imperial ambitions to colonize other fields? Or is this new planetary reach an unraveling of foundational hierarchies? Modernism, like modernity, exceeds definitional and disciplinary limitations. And yet, these terms require some set of meanings to provide any functional use. The conjunction of the need for limits and their failure to contain characterizes modernist studies today, recapitulating the logic of  itself. As Garry Leonard suggests,  is like the internal combustion engine: both exhibit an endlessly recurring dynamic of explosion and containment. The logic of modernity follows the hydraulics of pressure and explosive release; containment and then movement.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Beyond Anxiety and the Comfort Zone</h1>
<p>There is a palpable anxiety pervading modernist studies, according to Stephen Ross, a meta-critical angst about the nature of the field that manifests in uncanny attempts <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to define modernism and "make it new," thereby creating an ethically unjustifiable need for ourselves as a professorial elite.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> But a retreat into the comfort zone of a modernist studies based on late nineteenth-early twentieth century "high modernist" experimentation in Europe and the U.S., is neither desirable nor possible. The cat is already out of the bag. And yet, the danger of an expansionist modernism lapsing into meaninglessness or colonizing gestures is real.</p>
<p>To navigate between these extremes, I advocate a <span style="font-style:italic;">transformational</span> planetary epistemology rather than a merely expansionist or additive one, one that builds on the far-reaching implications of the linkage of modernism with modernity. This link, reflected in the title of the Modernist Studies Association's journal, <span style="font-style:italic;"></span>, might seem so obvious by now as to be unworthy of note. But it wasn't always so. In the early days of the field, modernism was understood primarily in formalist terms as a loose affiliation of movements coalescing around certain aesthetic rebellions, styles, and philosophical principles and resisting the aesthetics of immediate precursors in the arts and literature of so-called "high" culture.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Curiously, the substantive link between modernism and modernity appeared in Malcolm Bradbury and James McFarlane's introduction to their 1976 volume, <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism</span>. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Modernism is the one art that responds to the scenario of our chaos. It is the art consequent on Heisenberg's 'Uncertainty principle', of the destruction of civilization and reason in the First World War, of the world changed and reinterrupted by Marx, Freud, and Darwin, of capitalism and constant industrial acceleration, of existential exposure to meaninglessness or absurdity.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In spite of their book's limited canon, the seed was sown for a radical departure from aestheticism as the definitional foundation for modernism.</p>
<p>Modernism, for many, became a reflection of and engagement with a wide spectrum of historical changes, including intensified and alienating urbanization; the cataclysms of world war and technological progress run amok; the rise and fall of European empires; changing gender, class, and race relations; and technological inventions that radically changed the nature of everyday life, work, mobility, and communication. Once modernity became the defining cause of aesthetic engagements with it, the door opened to thinking about the specific conditions of modernity for different genders, races, sexualities, nations, and so forth. Modernity became modernities, a pluralization that spawned a plurality of modernisms and the circulations among them.</p>
<p>To resist the definitional expansions in modernist studies is to t modernism's constitutive link with modernity. Could it be that the anxieties about the geohistorical and generic expansion of modernist studies represents an uncanny desire to re-establish a particular early twentieth-century Western aesthetic style as the <span style="font-style:italic;">sina qua non</span> of modernism? What is the ethics of that interminably repeated comfort zone? How are we to break the hold of the old modernist mold? That is the question, if we want to foster a planetary modernist studies. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Thirteen ways of looking at the interconnections of modernism slash modernity. The point of Wallace Stevens's iconic poem—like the point of Cubism—is epistemological: that seeing is multi-faceted; that what is seen must be seen from multiple points of view. Hold it up. Walk around it. Mull on its multiplicities. Listen to others who hold it up, walk around it, mull on its multiplicities. Resist fixity, finality, single perspectives.</p>

<p>Interrogate the slash! A planetary epistemology in modernist studies begins by looking at the meanings embedded in that slash between . The slash both connects and separates, it is the paradox of all borders. Many regularly assume that modernism mirrors, reflects, reacts, or responds to modernity—as if the historical condition of modernity precedes the aesthetic response to it, as if modernism comes belatedly as the avant-garde of dissolving epistemological and political hegemonies. I want to suggest however, a simultaneity of effects and practices. I think we should stop positing modernism as modernity's self-reflexive other, its symptomatic reaction formation, its oppositional consciousness.</p>
<p>Instead, I suggest we regard modernism in its different geohistorical locations and periods as a powerful domain <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> a particular modernity, not something outside of it, caused by it, or responding belatedly to it. From this perspective, modernism is a force effecting change as much as it intersects other domains of change. Thus, I am suggesting that we treat modernism as the domain of creative expressivity <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> modernity's dynamic of rapid change, a domain that interacts with the other arenas of rupture such as technology, trade, migration, state formation, societal institutions, and so forth.</p>
<p>The slash between modernity/modernism implies a simultaneity, but also a distinction; a connection, but also a separation. Modernism is a part of modernity, a part that is centered in modernity's aesthetic dimension, which is distinct from other dimensions but not separate from them. Though interlocked with institutional or economic forces, for example, modernism's expressive domain is a product of particularly human agencies in the media of the creative, the aesthetic, and the representational. Focused on the contradictions of the slash, this approach opens doorways to seeing how the aesthetic interacts with other arenas of change. It also empowers a planetary approach to modernism that breaks the Anglo-European hold on the field. Every modernity has its distinctive modernism. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>I must confess, however, to some anxieties that I have not yet resolved. The power of those early concepts of modernism as the crisis of aesthetic representation, with a repudiation of nineteenth-century realism, remains very strong within me. It is one thing to claim, as I have, that texts like Tayeb Salih's <span style="font-style:italic;">Season of Migration to the North</span>  and Arundhati Roy's <span style="font-style:italic;">The God of Small Things</span>  are "modernist," defining a postcolonial modernism both interlocked with and yet distinct from Euro-American modernism.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> The formalist experimentalism of these texts makes them philosophically, psychologically, and aesthetically attuned to writers like Conrad, Joyce, Woolf, and Faulkner, however different their modernities. It's another thing entirely for me to make such a claim about a novel like <span style="font-style:italic;">Brick Lane</span> , Monica Ali's predominantly realist novel of Bangladeshi migration to London. <span style="font-style:italic;">Brick Lane</span> deliberately echoes <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, embeds epistolary narratives from London and Bangladesh, and deals centrally with what migration scholar Nikos Papastergiadis calls "the restless trajectories of modernity," the dialogic and contrapuntal psychologies characterizing the "turbulence of migration."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> But is <span style="font-style:italic;">Brick Lane</span> a "modernist novel"?</p>
<p>I'm caught in a conundrum of my own making—my insistence on a planetary approach to modernism, alongside my anxiety at the implications of its scope. This is a confession. I find it hard to call a novel like <span style="font-style:italic;">Brick Lane</span> "modernist." But I think this is my problem, not the problem of the more capacious understanding of modernism as the expressive domain of modernity I proposed earlier. I think the struggles within the field are embedded in my psyche. The anxiety is there, but I'm not proud of it. It needs to be worked through, as a holdover from the past. That's what it means to leave the comfort zone.</p>

<p>A planetary epistemology of  must break the mold of Eurocentrism. "<span style="font-style:italic;">Eurocentrism</span>," writes Aamir Mufti, is "an <span style="font-style:italic;">epistemological problem</span>" ("Global Corporatism," 493). Epistemology signifies ways of knowing and embeds the political questions of who is doing the knowing, for whom knowledge is produced, how knowledge is deployed, and who benefits from that deployment. Eurocentrism, of course, is not the only centrism on earth—all societies construct narratives of their own centrality, exceptionalism, and world view through which others are viewed and against which they are measured. But in modernist studies, Eurocentrism is the dominant centrism to confront because the West's narrative of itself is the story of its own invention of modernity <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and because the field of modernist studies itself began in the West as a study of Western modernities and modernisms. A planetary modernist studies begins with "provincializing Europe," to invoke Dipesh Chakrabarty's resonant phrase.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Add to this an awareness that the concept of "the West" is itself deeply centric, repressing the heterogeneities and peripheries <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> Europe and North America and the degree to which the West has never been and is not "one." Eurocentric "structures of historical knowledge," as Mufti writes,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>normalize and <span style="font-style:italic;">make</span> normative the idea of Europe as "the scene of the birth of the modern". . . . It is the social and cultural <span style="font-style:italic;">force</span> of this idea of Europe in intellectual life . . . that I am referring to here as Eurocentrism. . . . Humanistic culture is saturated with this informal developmentalism—a "first in the West, and then elsewhere" structure of global time. . . in which cultural objects from non-Western societies can be grasped only with reference to the categories of European cultural history, as pale or partial reflections of the latter, to be seen ultimately as coming late, lagging behind, and lacking originality.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The old mold of modernist studies narrates just such a tale of informal developmentalism—" we" did it first in the West (although the origin dates and locations differ radically, from Baudelaire to Imagism, from the Impressionists to the Cubists); and then "they" did it elsewhere: derivative and belated.</p>
<p>The power of the field's originary narratives of modernism is a wonder to behold.</p>

<p>How can we challenge those Eurocentric originary narratives, exploding radically out of their forces of containment, to invoke Leonard's combustion metaphor? The first step is to set aside the nominal definition of modernity as it has so commonly been constructed:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Modernity is: [fill in the blanks]</p>
<p>a.</p>
<p>b.</p>
<p>c.</p>
<p>d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Anthony Giddens, for example, a progressive doyen of sociological modernity studies, defines modernity as a specific historical development characterized by the rise of the nation-state, panoptic bureaucracies, and capitalism as developed in the West from the eighteenth century and spread to many parts of the world by the twentieth century. In his view, globalization is the diffusion of Western modernity to the rest of the world. He is not alone.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>A planetary epistemology of modernity, in contrast, needs to be relational, delineating not a nominal set of characteristics (e.g., "big" = x, y, and z), but rather defining <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  one thing in relation to another (e.g., "big" is not "small"). It focuses on the dynamics of change, the self-consciousness of change, or even the illusion of change—a "before" and "after," an "old" and a "new."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> As Bruno Latour writes, "Modernity comes in as many versions as there are thinkers or journalists, yet all its definitions point, in one way or another, to the passage of time. The adjective 'modern' designates a new regime, an acceleration, a rupture, a revolution in time." <sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> This relational, adjectival approach to modernity is more suited than a nominal definition to planetarity because it enables recognition of a spatial dimension to modernity's temporality, an interactional set of relations throughout the globe that may also manifest differently in particular places and times. It provides a comparative framework that balances the commensurable—what different modernities share—with the incommensurable—how they are different.</p>
<p>Of course, the relational dynamic of old and new is fraught with contradictions. Elsewhere, I have posited modernity's relational structure as a temporal narrative that invents the "before" as "tradition." Tradition is itself a construct of modernity, coming into being at the moment of its loss, a process both celebrated and lamented. In relational terms, Modernity contains within it a struggle—often a violent one—between modernizers and traditionalists—evident, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> the U.S. and the Middle East today. It also contains a palimpsestic layering of new over old, one that often involves a misrecognition of powerful continuities that is constitutive of modernity. For some, such misrecognition involves a haunting of the old in the new, a return of the repressed occasioned by the ruthless forgetting of the past that Nietzsche and De Man theorized as constitutive of modernity.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> For others, it represents illusory thinking based in what Bruno Latour describes as the needs of the moderns "to invent the Great Divide" between themselves and the premoderns."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>In facing the question of how new is "the new," and how much must we forget to think of it as "the new," we also bump squarely into a major difficulty with the relational approach. Where the nominal definition provides the comfort of relative stability (modernity = a, b, and c), the relational approach opens us up to the difficult question of whether anything is "not modern," and thus whether any expressive form is "not modernist." Is there a historical period which is not undergoing rapid change across a spectrum of social indicators? Are there texts which are not engaged with that change? For any text that I might name, would someone rise up to defend its particular form of engagement with a particular modernity? Milton's <span style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Lost</span> for example? Willa Cather's <span style="font-style:italic;">O Pioneers!</span>? Norman Mailer's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Naked and the Dead</span>? For <span style="font-style:italic;">modernity/ modernism</span> to have utility as analytic categories, even relationally defined, must we identify the <span style="font-style:italic;">not modern, not modernist</span>? <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>Striking, you might say, how much that map exhibits a modernist poetics drawn from the early twentieth century in the West. In fact, Satya P. Mohanty challenged my chart on just those grounds, saying that it represents an imposition of an aesthetic perspective onto modernity, instead of the philosophical one featuring individualism that he prefers, or the socioeconomic one Giddens delineates. He may be right.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Perhaps all relational definitions slide into the nominal, incorporating willy-nilly some presupposed characteristics. As I struggle with this problem, I acknowledge that I am what I study, formed by my background in literary studies—this is epistemologically true. I cut my critical teeth on manifesto modernism—perhaps my efforts to move outside of my epistemological frame end up repeating it. On the other hand, for the word <span style="font-style:italic;">modernity</span> to mean anything at all, we need to think about what is put into relation with what, and how that relationship takes on different forms at different geohistorical locations. Perhaps the modernist poetics of the early twentieth century in the West presciently articulated a logic at work in other times and places.</p>

<p>A relational epistemology allows us to see the globe afresh, to see that modernity which is not one, to see modernity in its multiple and diverse forms in the geohistory of the world. In step with the rapidly proliferating rhetorics of plural modernities, I ask, here, for an approach diametrically opposed to that of Fredric Jameson in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Singular Modernity</span>, in which he argues that "Everyone knows the formula by now. . . .you talk about 'alternative' or 'alternative' modernities. . . . But this is to overlook the other fundamental meaning of modernity which is that of a worldwide capitalism. . . . I believe that the only satisfactory semantic meaning of modernity lies in its association with capitalism."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Such a reductionist view limits the nominalist definition, even more radically than Giddens does, to a set of one: capitalism. Jameson's notion of singularity impoverishes what needs to be a complex approach to the overdeterminations of history and the enmeshments of different systems of power in understanding modernity.</p>
<p>The profusion of terms for modernity's plural formations belies the singularity Jameson seeks. The field abounds in such adjectives for modernity or modernities as <span style="font-style:italic;">multiple, polycentric, early, at large, alternative, other, peripheral, divergent, discrepant, uneven, conjunctural</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">recurrent</span>.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Each term is its own keyword, with different nuances, particularly in what it suggests about the relation to Western modernities. I like how they suggest a spatial approach to modernity, a necessity for globalizing a concept that has been predominantly temporal. I like how they assume an uneven temporality for the emergence of different modernities. Some arise at the same time, such as the modernities of colonizer and colonized in the <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> of Britain, Egypt, and India. Some arise at different times, such as the early modernities of India in the fourteenth-fifteenth centuries or the postcolonial modernities of Africa after 1960. I like how the term <span style="font-style:italic;">polycentric</span> posits each modernity as its own center, with others as their peripheries. I also like how the terms <span style="font-style:italic;">uneven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">discrepant</span> invite analysis of unequal <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  power and privilege, both between differently located modernities and within a single location. I do object to the way such terms as <span style="font-style:italic;">alternative, other, peripheral</span>, and even <span style="font-style:italic;">divergent</span> reinstate Western modernity as the center, with all the "other" modernities as marginal or derivative. In sum, I like terms that suggest the fluidity and multiplicity of modernities, terms that refuse to use one modernity as the measure of all others.</p>
<p>I have been probing the potential of yet another term, <span style="font-style:italic;">recurrent</span> modernities, because it suggests that human history cycles unevenly through periods of relative stasis and then explosive kinesis; between retrenchment and expansion, continuity and change, consolidation and risk; between inward and outward mobilities.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The concept of recurrent modernities requires a capacious historical archive, the <span style="font-style:italic;">longue durée</span> of world historians or what Wai Chi Dimock calls "deep time."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Different points of the globe flare up at different times as nodal points of transformational change across a wide spectrum of societal domains, each taking a particular form in its geohistorical location—from long ago world systems to today's globalization. As Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar writes, "<span style="font-style:italic;">everywhere, at every national/cultural site, modernity is not one but many, modernity is not new but old and familiar; modernity is incomplete and necessarily so.</span>"<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>

<p>"There is no modernity without coloniality," Walter D. Mignolo writes.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> He is speaking specifically of European and Latin American modernities formed constitutively through conquest since 1500. He regards them as distinctive modernities, but thoroughly enmeshed, formed through interaction with each other through conquest, or through colonial and postcolonial relations. "We have come to understand colonialism and conquest as the very condition of possibility for modernity and for aesthetic modernism," writes Andreas Huyssen of Euro-American modernism.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Have we all come to this understanding, I wonder, or do (post)colonial modernities and modernisms remain at the periphery of the field?</p>
<p>More fundamentally, do other, even earlier empires combine periods of violent conquest with rapid technological change, world-systems of trade and cultural exchange, the bang/clash of different peoples and their world views, and new representational practices in the arts and other expressive domains? Yes, I think they do. For starters, the Roman Empire; Tang Dynasty China; the Muslim Empire centered especially in the commercial and cultural capitals of Baghdad, Al-Andalus, and Timbuktu; the Mughal Empire in India; and the largest land empire in human history, the Mongol Empire—all encompassed these phenomena I am calling modernity <span style="font-style:italic;">before</span> the modernities of the post-1500 world-system. All produced explosively creative mixtures of peoples and cultural practices.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Putting the formation of Western modernity within that <span style="font-style:italic;">longue durée</span> does not diminish its global power, but it does change the exceptionalist, diffusionist, and hierarchical originary myths of modernity that have dominated the field. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Recognizing the violence and conquest that are so often a constitutive part of recurrent modernities helps prevent discourses of modernity's fluidity, multidirectionality, and reciprocal exchange from sliding into a utopian rhetoric of happy hybridity. To counter this tendency, I keep reminding myself that the massive ruptures of modernity across a spectrum of social formations are most likely to occur during periods of rapid, often brutal conquest that cause wide-scale material, psychological, spiritual, representational, and epistemological dislocation.</p>
<p>And yet, with the dislocations of imperial or hegemonic dominance come creative re-locations. With suffering also come the transformative agencies of the human imagination. Recurrent modernities, I believe, are neither pure defeat nor pure progress. They are geohistorical moments of dynamic kinesis that put in dialectic the dystopic with the utopic, slaveries with freedoms, destructions with creations. At the center of these contradictions lie the self-reflexive and representational domains of modernity, the arena of all modernisms.</p>
<p>Just think of jazz: Remember that Paul Gilroy argues that the first modern subjects of the Enlightenment period were the Africans torn from their homes, enslaved in the New World—alienated, exiled, transplanted, and infinitely creative.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> And in that new world, their descendants blended European and African musics to create creolized musical forms that have themselves transformed, traveled, and transplanted throughout the planet.</p>

<p>Polycentric, recurrent modernities and their modernisms develop not in isolation but always relationally through encounters with other societies and civilizations, encounters which are transcultural, not unidirectional. "Les contacts entre les cultures—," Édouard Glissant writes,—c'est là une de données de la modernité" / "Contact among cultures is one of the givens of modernity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PR</span>, 39/26). Historians of the global ecumene like André Gunder Frank trace large-scale patterns of encounter through commerce, war, technology, migrations of people, and cultural practices.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Anthropologists like James Clifford and Arjun Appardurai trace traveling cultures, intercultural networks, and the processes of cultural translation and transcultration, asserting that distinctive cultures form through hybridic interaction with others.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hybrid Muse</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Transnational Poetics</span> Jahan Ramazani adapts these concepts of circulating cultures to propose a planetary poetics of modernism that is "both discretely located and thoroughly enmeshed, networked, cross-racialized."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> As Laura Doyle and Laura Winkiel argue in <span style="font-style:italic;">Geomodernisms</span>, thinking "in terms of interconnected modernisms" "breaks open" the term <span style="font-style:italic;">modernism</span> into something they call "geomoderisms," a landscape of interlocking engagements with "cultural and political discourses of global modernity."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In "Modernism, Geopolitics, Globalization," Melba Cuddy-Keane brings the "interactivity and interdependency" of "cultural globalization" to modernist studies, insisting on the multidirectional, kinetic, and impure fluidity of "disjunctive global <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  flows."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Reginia Gagnier's Global Circulation Project is a vast online dialogue among scholars around the world on the circulations of different Anglophone modernisms.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>The borderlands of contact zones create creolizations on all sides through patterns of imitation, adaptation, transculturation, and cultural translation. "I call creolization the meeting," Glissant writes, "the interference, shock, harmonies, and disharmonies between the cultures of the world, in the realized totality of the world" ("Unforeseeable Diversity," 290). Beyond <span style="font-style:italic;">creolization</span>, dozens of keywords in English are being used—and presumably in other languages—for these processes, each with different resonances, often suggesting both utopic and dystopic forms of intercultural encounter. Think, for example, of the opposing weight of terms like <span style="font-style:italic;">contamination</span> versus <span style="font-style:italic;">adaptation</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">theft</span> versus <span style="font-style:italic;">translation</span>. I have been collecting these keywords and sorting them into distinctive rhetorics based on the biological (e.g., adaptation, bastardization, contamination, grafting, rhizome, transplantation, etc.); the corporeal (e.g., incorporation, absorption, cannibalization, ingestion, etc.); the commercial (e.g., borrowing, commerce, exchange, lending, traffic, etc.); the political (e.g., accommodation, alliance, appropriation, collaboration, co-optation, etc.); the technological (e.g., interlocking, network, web, transmission, etc.); the cultural (e.g., assimilation, blending, encounter, hybridization, vernacularization, etc.); and the representational (e.g., mimesis, cutting and pasting, distortion, translation, versioning, etc.). In short, the vast array of keywords for interculturalism on a global scale point to the major domains that constellate different modernities.</p>
<p>Models of planetary cultural traffic, mimesis, and translation need to supplant older concepts of modernist internationalism, which are typically based on binaries of Self-Other, modern-traditional, civilized-savage, high art-primitive art. The appropriation model in particular regards the modernists of the West as cosmopolitan producers of culture who cite or steal the traditions of the Rest to break out of the repressive, clichéd, or narrow representational conventions of the West. Whether used in praise or critique of the West's modernism, the appropriation model recapitulates the logic of imperialism, with the Rest providing the raw material transmuted into modernist art in the West. As Jahan Ramazani argues, "Criticism that reduces high modernist . . . 'appropriations' to orientalist theft or primitivist exoticism may risk circumscribing instead of opening up possibilities for global and transnational analysis." <sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Demoiselles D'Avignon</span> , with its incorporation of African masks into three of the five faces of the prostitutes in the painting, is often invoked as the iconic example of this appropriation model.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>] As Simon Gikandi has argued, such discussions often refuse to grant African art the position of aesthetic or formal innovation, instead reducing it to the fetishistic and psychological.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In contrast to the appropriation model, a planetary approach to cultural circulation would stress how the agencies of African artists producing and being collected in Africa in the late nineteenth century were part of a colonial modernity, constituting a colonial modernism that Picasso and the cubists indigenized, that is, made native to Parisian modernism. The creative agencies of modernities outside the West circulated into the West as transformative influences. Who, we must ask, is derivative of whom? [<a name="3-text" href="#3">. 3</a>-<a name="6-text" href="#6">6</a>]</p>
<p>Take for another example the Ukiyo-e, or Floating World woodblocks from Japan, absorbed into Paris in the 1880s as <span style="font-style:italic;">Japonisme</span> swept the West while Japan itself modernized <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">in the Meiji period. [<a name="7-text" href="#7">. 7</a> and <a name="8-text" href="#8">8</a>] As a form of "low" or popular art, the Ukiyo-e had been produced since the seventeenth century in Edo, a little sea of commercial and aesthetic modernity within Japan's feudal state. Van Gogh called the Ukiyo-e "savage," and freely translated their bold aesthetics of cropped edges, radical designs, and color patterns, to make his palette and frame "modern."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> [<a name="9-text" href="#9">9</a>] Mary Cassatt indigenized the Ukiyo-e as well, adapting formalist qualities, as in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Boating Party</span> , along with their fascination with interiors, fabrics, material culture, and moments of intimacy [<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>]. She did not regard the Ukiyo-e artists as "savage," but rather promoted their artistry through collecting Ukiyo-e and displaying her favorite, Utamaro, side by side with her <span style="font-style:italic;">Suite of Ten</span> (1890-1891) in her own house. [<a name="1-text" href="#1">. 11</a> and <a name="2-text" href="#2">12</a>] Again, I ask, who is derivative of whom?

<p>A planetary aesthetics of modernism needs to be transformative rather than merely additive. It is worthwhile to identify texts—visual, verbal, auditory—outside the West that exhibit the aesthetics of so-called "high modernism," but a fully planetary approach should aim to detect the different forms that representational rupture take in connection with different modernities. We need to let go of the familiar laundry list of aesthetic properties drawn from the Western culture capitals of the early twentieth century as <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> definitional core of modernism. I'm attached to that list, as I have confessed. But we need to provincialize it, that is to see "high" or "avant-garde" modernism as ONE articulation of a particularly situated modernism—an important modernism but not the measure by which all others are judged and to which all others must be compared. Instead, we must look across the planet, through deep time, and vertically within each location to identify sites of the slash—modernity/modernism—and then focus our attention on the nature of the particular modernity in question, explore the shapes and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  forms of creative expressivities engaging that modernity, and ask what cultural and political work those aesthetic practices perform as an important domain within it.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: I am not suggesting we abandon consideration of the aesthetic, the formal, particularly the creative agencies of expressive culture that put into question the representational conventions of their time and place. I want to avoid the familiar polarization of aesthetics and politics that privileges one over the other. Rather, I hope that we can be open to different kinds of aesthetic innovation linked to different modernities around the world and through time. In this regard, the aesthetic is always imbricated in the political, the historical. And <span style="font-style:italic;">vice versa</span>. Not a single set of formalist characteristics, but rather the formal <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span>, however it might articulate the modern.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the experimental blend of high and low culture as aesthetic markers of an African diasporic modernity in the Harlem Renaissance. Langston Hughes's <span style="font-style:italic;">Montage of a Dream Deferred</span> weds a jazz and blues aesthetic to the lyric sequence form of the twentieth-century long poem and the dialectical principles of cinematic montage:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Take the particular intertextuality of postcolonial modernisms. The global citational strategies of Pound and Eliot are reinvented in the dialogic engagement of the colonized with the colonizer, through denaturalizing mimicries or indigenizing transplantions, as in Tayeb Salih's or Arundhati Roy's rewriting of <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>. Roy's play with Conrad's title—"Dark of Heartness tiptoed into the Heart of Darkness"—does more than mimic in a colonial register. It relocates the "darkness" of all states (colonizing, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  colonized, and postcolonial) from the purely geopolitical to the interpenetrations of public and private, institutional and personal, thereby fostering a rereading of Marlow's lie to the Intended.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> Postcolonial intertextualities are not derivative; they innovate, in a different register, breaking with other and often multiple conventions.</p>
<p>A planetary modernist poetics must be plural, opening up the concept of formal ruptures to a wide array of representational engagements with modernity. "Rather than privilege the radically new in Western avant-gardist fashion," writes Huyssen, "we may want to focus on the complexity of repetition and rewriting, <span style="font-style:italic;">bricolage</span> and translation," or the layering of high and low, realism and experiment, " thus expanding our notion of innovation."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> In Latin America, Mary Louise Pratt argues, European avant-gardism developed alongside other experimentalisms with rural, frontier, and ethnographic aesthetics blending orality, popular forms, realism, the vernacular, and the supernatural—as in the modernist magic realism of Gabriel García Márquez.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup></p>

<p>How can modernist studies be planetary if it is monolingual, if it operates within the <span style="font-style:italic;">lingua franca</span> of any given era, if it reproduces the linguistic hegemonies of modernity's imperial legacies, if, for example, it remains within the confines of global English today?</p>
<p>"Le dit de la Relation," Glissant writes, "est multilingue. Par-delà les impositions des puissances économiques et des pressions culturelles, ils s'oppose en droit au totalitanisme des visées, monolingues" / "Relation is spoken multilingually. Going beyond the impositions of economic forces and cultural pressures, Relation rightfully opposes totalitarianism of any monolingual intent" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PR</span>, 31/19). Even more than multilingualism, however, Glissant advocates a "worldness" in which "we write . . . in the presence of all the world's languages, all of them, leaving none out of consideration":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>If we say that we write, henceforth, in the presence of all the world's languages, . . . If we rediscover the fact that we can change through exchange with others, without losing ourselves. . . then we are able to glimpse what I would like to call worldness, which is our common condition today.</p>
<div class="attrib">("Unforeseeable Diversity," 287)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Modernity's polylogue is a vast archive of hundreds of languages beyond the ken of any individual. But Glissant's "worldness"—his concept of "planetary consciousness"—asks not for the impossible linguistically, but rather for a transformative epistemology: that we write with the consciousness of the diversity of languages and cultures and the richness that these differences bring. In this sense, the multilingual archipelago of the Caribbean is his model for "worldness." Creolization, for Glissant, is not the synthesis or fusion of difference into a monolingual sameness, not a global homogenization. Instead, <span style="font-style:italic;">creolité</span> represents the principle of linguistic differences in mixture: the contact zones <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of encounter, linkages, interconnections—a poetics of multilingual relation based in the continual play of multiple vernaculars.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Translation has a central role to play in the multilingual globalization of modernist studies. Translation involves a paradox of the commensurable and incommensurable, as Emily Apter argues in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Translation Zone</span>. Equivalence from one language to another, one culture to another is not possible, but the existence of world systems for thousands of years has necessitated the continual presence of translation, evident in the ancient Rosetta Stone in Egyptian hieroglyphics, Egyptian Demotic, and Greek from 196 B.C.E. and the more recent Chengde Imperial Stele in Manchu, Tibetan, Chinese, and Mongol from the Qing Dynasty in the eighteenth century. [<a name="3-text" href="#3">. 13</a> and <a name="4-text" href="#4">14</a>] Planetary cultural circulations, networks, and enmeshments of the global and local all depend upon translation, broadly understood from the linguistic to the cultural. Indeed, linguistic translation is essentially a practice of intercultural encounter and border thinking, the basis upon which other cultural traffic depends. Translation is a form of adaptation, transplantation, indigenization—from one culture to another. The multidirectional traveling of modernities and their modernisms is fundamentally a translational practice.</p>
<p>On a planetary scale, the multitude of vernaculars coexists with the singularity of a <span style="font-style:italic;">lingua franca</span>, a common language that enables the cultural flows of the global ecumene—from Aramaic, Latin, Sanskrit, and Chinese to Arabic, French, and English. The coexistence is a dynamic and tense one, with the vernaculars perpetually under threat, with the native speakers of the common language privileged above all others.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Translation in planetary modernist studies today ought to be reciprocal and multidirectional. But it is too much of a one-way street, with the rest of the world translating English texts into other languages, with many fewer works being translated into English, and with English translation too often serving as the mediation between two other languages.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> Challenging modernity's complicity with colonialism in the formation of a planetary modernist studies requires studying, reading, and empowering the vernaculars.</p>
<p>Every modernity plays out linguistically in a dialectic of the vernacular and the cosmopolitan. The linguistic cosmopolitanism of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses, The Cantos</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> is famously citational, absorbing languages from elsewhere into English. Make no mistake, however. The opposition between vernacular and <span style="font-style:italic;">lingua franca</span> or cosmopolitanism does not reproduce the binary of traditional/modern. The vernacular has often signaled a modernity of a different kind, a resistance to the hegemony of the language of elites of all kinds as part of widespread societal change.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Chaucer's Middle-English and Dante's Italian were harbingers of the Renaissance, breaking with the dominance of Latin. Women, at times denied access to the languages of "high literature," wrote and read in the vernacular, helping local spoken languages develop literary cultures: for example, Lady Murasaki in the early eleventh century, broke with the dominance of Chinese in high culture, by writing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tale of Genji</span> in Japanese.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> In medieval Al-Andalus, a new poetic form arose called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Muwashshahāt</span> counterpointing the parallel love laments of a man speaking in classical Arabic and a woman speaking in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the vernacular, as Maria Rosa Menocal shows.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> In fifteenth-century Orissa, a group of low-caste (sudra) poet-saints challenged the Sanskrit-educated elite in producing revolutionary poems in Oriya, the local vernacular, according to Satya P. Mohanty. One of these, Balaram Das, writes an explicitly feminist narrative in the vernacular that advocates gender and caste equality ("Alternative Modernities," 3-5). In his novella, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Broken Nest</span>, Rabindranath Tagore conflates the association of the vernacular with modernity and women writers by having a woman's anonymously published, fresh, modern writing in the vernacular take literary Calcutta by storm for its break with the artifice of convention-ridden Bengali poetics.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> The vernacular, as Amit Chaudhuri writes, is "the idiom of modernity."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>

<p>I see doubt in your faces; I feel doubt in my own. Ten ways of seeing that blackbird have produced an archive of modernisms that is staggering in its global and temporal reach. That way paralysis lies. What's a poor scholar to do? This is too much. That's just going too far. Don't we need to discipline the proliferation of modernisms and their interconnections? Can't we just globalize modernism within a single and identifiable historical period—let's say, 1890 through 1950, as the Modernist Studies Association's website proclaims, or 1840 through 1950, if we want to include the French? <span style="font-style:italic;">Genug</span>, enough already! <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Ah, that old comfort zone again, the return of what is so hard to repress in modernist studies. I suggest, however, that we return instead to the full significance of the slash: . If modernism is constitutively linked to modernity as the creative and expressive domain within it, then we are bound to recognize that particular modernisms take shape within different modernities and can potentially end up looking very different from each other. That slash has consequences.</p>

<p>To work within a planetary framework, no single scholar need do it all. Instead, we can recognize the foundational meaning of collaboration in the project of scholarship—we share a common project, however our views, methods, and languages differ. We can each locate ourselves in a manageable way among the multiplicity of critical practices in modernist studies. We can find our own place on the critical map of the field, one that suits our particular interests and knowledge base. As navigational guide, I suggest one or more of four main critical practices, each distinctive but also blendable: Re-vision; Recovery; Circulation; Collage.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Re-vision</span> is the act of looking again, of defamiliarizing the familiar archive by looking anew through different lenses, asking new questions of "high modernism": Picasso, Pound, Joyce, Woolf, Eliot, and so forth. What are the traces of other modernities within the texts of European and Anglo-America "high modernism"? Where are the footprints of the planetary in the local formations of the West? What is the ghost in the machine? Scores of scholars since Simon Gikandi's pathbreaking <span style="font-style:italic;">Maps of Englishness</span> have learned to read coloniality in the modernisms of Europe and the U.S. <sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> But the planetary not only incorporates Western empires but also exceeds them. The planetary of what Dimock calls "deep time"—a transcontinental spatiality as well as <span style="font-style:italic;">longue durée—</span>needs to be reread in the modernisms of the West.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Recovery</span> is the act of digging, an archaeology of new archives—other modernities outside the familiar Western ones and thus other forms of creative expressivities. New books on other modernisms are proliferating, working with modernisms contemporaneous with or in different time-frames from Western modernisms. In his translation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Kalapurnodaymau/ The Sound of the Kiss</span> from the Telegu of the sixteenth century, V. Narayana Rao, for example, claims an early modernism for Pingali Suranna, citing his invention of the novel-in-verse genre for Telegu literature, his radical disruption of literary conventions, and his psychologizing of the human mind. Rao also translates a more recent Indian modernism: <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanyasulkam/ Girls for Sale</span>, an 1892 Telegu play using parody, masquerade, and satire to attack both the colonial government and the gender system within Indian culture.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> Multilingual scholars are the avant-garde of such recoveries, locating buried and forgotten texts in the global archive of languages, but scholars working in translation are also essential to bring knowledge of these modernisms into the <span style="font-style:italic;">lingua franca</span> of the field.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Circulation</span> is the archive of mobility, calling for the act of seeing linkages, networks, conjunctures, creolizations, intertextualities, travels, and transplantations connecting modernisms from different parts of the planet. Often the pathways are the routes born of colonialism, passages to India, Africa, or the Caribbean by western writers like Forster or Conrad; passages to the colonizers' metropole by writers like Jean Rhys, Mulk Raj Anand, or Tayeb Salih. How is that relationality experienced, reflected upon, represented? What is the interplay of roots and routes in those circulations across the globe? Unlike a center/periphery model, circulation stresses the interactive and dynamic, assuming multiple agencies, centers, and conjunctures around the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Collage</span> is the archive of radical juxtaposition, the scholar's act of paratactic cutting and pasting. It establishes a montage of differences where the putting side by side illuminates those differences at the same time that it spotlights commonalities. Ideally, collage is a non-hierarchical act of comparison, a joining that illuminates both commensurabilities and incommensurabilities. Take, for example, from different parts of the world and different decades, Aimé Césaire's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notebook for a Return to the Native Land</span> and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dictée</span>. Voila! What comes into focus is a diasporic modernism based in the instabilities of colonial exile and the imaginative recreation of lost homes: for Césaire, Negritude reuniting the diasporas of slavery with black Africa; for Cha, the maternal body as route to a syncretic phenomenology of home and homeland. Both invoking the rhythm of <span style="font-style:italic;">aller/retour</span>.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup></p>
<p>Re-vision, Recovery, Circulation, and Collage: Four strategies for reading particular modernisms within a planetary epistemology. This is manageable. We can each find our place on the map without vertigo, paralysis. We don't need to try to do it all. We can change our epistemological framework and locate our specific method within it, as one part of a large, fluid, mobile project to which all of us are contributing, differently.

<p>Planetarity in its very name invokes the Earth in deep time. Does the planet have its own modernities, crises distinct from those of the human species? The critical practices of re-vision, recovery, circulation, and collage can examine the meanings of the non-human world for the human and the interactions of human modernities with the Earth as a planet in the cosmos. Can we, for example, re-vision Eliot's waste land in the context of ecological disasters and read the human mind as objective correlative of the landscape scarred by war? How do the rivers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness, Season of Migration to the North</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The God of Small Things</span> both shape and exceed the human stories upon them? "Time passes," Woolf famously writes in <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, with human modernities a mere parenthesis within nature's geohistory.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps more answerable is to examine the intersection of human modernities with the earth's non-human species, diversities, and cosmic rhythms. Ursula K. Heise <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  calls for an "'eco-cosmopolitanism', or environmental world citizenship" that frees the term cosmopolitanism from early twentieth-century modernist "connotations of social privilege and leisure travel."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> Glissant's poetics of relation includes a call to recognize the "relational interdependence of all lands, of the whole Earth," and the particularly harsh consequences of the "politics of ecology" for the poor (<span style="font-style:italic;">PR</span>, 146). He asks for an "aesthetics of the earth" which is not "anachronistic or naïve: reactionary or sterile," but rather an "aesthetics of rupture and connection," of "disruption and intrusion" that can encompass "the half-starved dust of Africas," "the mud of flooded Asias," "in epidemics, masked forms of exploitation, flies buzz-bombing the skeleton skins of children," "in city sewers" and so forth (<span style="font-style:italic;">PR</span>, 150, 151). In what way do our human modernities Other the Earth, he wonders.</p>

<p>Planetarity as I use the term is an epistemology, not an ontology. On a human scale, the "worldness" the term invokes—to echo Glissant—means a polylogue of languages, cultures, viewpoints, and standpoints on . It requires attention to modes of local and translocal meaning-making and translation, to processes and practices of perception and expression on a global scale. It is not nominalist, fundamentalist: it doesn't name a singular , thereby privileging one over all others. It must, by its very "worldness," encompass multitudes on a global grid of relational networks. And that means encompassing contradictions, tensions, oppositions, and asymmetries. Like rooted and situated cosmopolitanisms, planetarity suggests a capacity to engage simultaneously with local and global modernities. It embraces the generative energies and synergies of modernism's Tower of Babel. In that, it is utopian. Not very quotidian, I know; not down and dirty in the trenches of reading, teaching, conferencing, publishing. But nonetheless planetarity is a vision that can percolate through the practices of everyday professional life.</p>
<p>Planetarity is not a threat, it is an opportunity. It means leaving the comfort zone for the contact zone.</p>

For the shifting rhetorics of the planetary, global, or worldness, see for example, Mary Louise Pratt, <span style="font-style:italic;">Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation</span> (London: Routledge, 1992), 1-37; Paul Gilroy, <span style="font-style:italic;">Postcolonial Melancholia</span> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005), 29-57; Wai Chee Dimock, <span style="font-style:italic;">Through Other Continents: American Literature Across Deep Time</span> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2006); Edward Said, "Culture and the Vultures," <span style="font-style:italic;">Times Higher Education Supplement</span> 24 (January 1992): 19; Bruce Robbins, "Comparative Cosmopolitans," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Cosmopolitics: Thinking and Feeling beyond the Nation</span>, ed.
