      At the turn of the twentieth century, an extended community of American and European actors, dancers, and physical culture teachers created a spectrum of “body cultures” that responded and contributed to social modernity and artistic modernism. Body cultures are theories about how bodies should look, feel, work, and move, and physical practices for training and presenting oneself accordingly. Such combinations of somatic theory and practice are culturally and historically specific, determined by the needs, interests, and places of their making. In this period, they occurred within multiple contexts, including theater, dance, fashion, medicine, labor, sport, and “physical culture” (the contemporary term for calisthenic exercise).<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Collectively, they crafted and visualized a “modern” body, ready for work, play, and self-expression. This essay considers how modern body cultures such as the American Delsarte and Mensendieck systems reached for industrial, disciplinary efficiency and individualized, emancipatory expressiveness, thus uniting social modernity and artistic modernism.
    </p>
<p>
      The body cultures most explicitly and frequently connected to industrial and social modernity are those that pursued engineered efficiency. This somatic ideal can be seen in the rationalized, disciplined, and mechanized body of Taylorized assembly line workers, the Tiller Girls and Ziegfeld Follies theatrical extravaganzas, physical education jumping jacks, the modern military assembly, and the mass movement performances recorded by Leni Riefenstahl. Alternatively, the body culture that is most obviously associated with artistic expressive modernism valued holistic fluidity and the search for archaic, primitive, and authentic  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> somatic experience. This relaxed, flexible, and individualized body is associated with the un-corseted and lounging avant-garde elite, the athletic New Woman, barefoot modern dancers, and German <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span>’s nudists frolicking in meadows. Following Foucault, or Adorno and Horkheimer, it is tempting to see bodies in the first category as the subject of discipline, against which those in the second react by remaking the body into a site of liberation.
    </p>
<p>
      Although they seem to be at odds, these two modes of embodiment – disciplinary efficiency and emancipatory expressiveness – actually co-existed and were even united within specific body culture praxis. This essay joins recent scholarship by offering two linked case studies of how modernizing body cultures “often elided the question of the relation between external and internal disciplines, between a mechanical and a motivational or expressive model of the body,” as Tim Armstrong argues in his study of writers’ physical regimes and self-reconstructions.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Similarly, Carrie J. Preston shows that Isadora Duncan, probably the greatest icon of the expressive and organic modern body, “consistently position[ed] her choreography at the juncture of motorized movement and soulful expression.” Duncan herself said that in order to perform, she had to “place a motor in [her] soul.” Although Duncan’s performances appeared to be effortless improvisations, mechanical metaphors abound in her philosophy and process of choreographing, rehearsing, and performing. The force of her “motor” energy, focused through repetition, produced a “multiplied body” that, like a powered machine, accomplished many tasks at once.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Whereas the intellectual lineage from the original French Delsarte system of rhetorical gesture to Duncan and other modern dancers in the United States and Europe is well-recognized, the path from Delsartism to Mensendieck body mechanics exercise is less well known and has yet to be contextualized.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> This essay offers three simultaneous layers of exploration into the expressive efficiencies of American Delsarte and Mensendieck body cultures. First, there is a chronological narrative of how each emerged, the latter out of the former, and how these essentially European schools of body training evolved in American contexts. The character of those changes provides the second layer. Delsarte and Mensendieck formulated extremely orderly systems of movement, one explicitly artistic and the other explicitly mechanical, but both rationalized physical positions and motions. In American contexts, practitioners of each program would increasingly focus on individual personality development, thus merging efficiency and expression. Recovering their similarities enables us to see the third layer; in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, some emancipatory forms of artistic modernism and disciplinary forms of social modernity could work together in mutually constitutive ways.
    </p>
<p>
      The importance of uniting expression and efficiency is evident in the early roots of Delsartism. In 1839, French singer François Delsarte introduced an educational system of oratorical gesture that was used in European and American ministry, political speeches, theater, pantomime, dramatic dance, and film acting through the 1920s. He believed that emotions reliably generated uniform, essential, eternal, and specific  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> physical movements. His goal was to study the innate postures, gestures, and facial expressions that revealed genuine emotions, so that actors and other rhetoricians could learn to convincingly and sincerely manifest those feelings.
    </p>
<p>
      Delsarte’s method of theatrical training was based on a rationalized taxonomy of emotional affect, organized in a series of three by three charts. Each limb, appendage, and facial feature was assigned nine positions based on its movement in an “eccentric” (outward), “normal” (orthogonal), or “concentric” (inward) direction. Each position of the hand, arm, leg, head, eyes, and so on, corresponded to a specific emotion, but neither the meaning nor the position were static. Rather, each was modulated by the direction and quality of movement. Motion knit the elements together into a meaningful whole, like the transformation that occurs when letters are arranged into words, and words accumulate into sentences. In the chart of the “Expressions of the Mouth,” when the lips are turned down at the edges, the signified meaning is disapproval. Lips pressed together indicate emotional firmness. In combination, the meaning is “disapproval plus firmness = discontent.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the “Degrees of Affirmation” chart, the arm circles down from “It is absolute, it is enchanting, it is evident, [and] it is certain,” to, at the horizontal position simply, “It is.” Continuing on the lower rotation, the arm signifies “It is probable [. . .] doubtful [. . .] improbable,” “it is not,” “it is impossible,” and finally, “it is evil (or rejected).”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> If one wanted to signify the physical conditions of “fatigue, vertigo, or intoxication,” the straight-legged wide-angled position seen in the center square of the leg positions chart (thus in the “normal-normal” position) was appropriate [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Or, if combined with other signifiers, the same pose could convey “familiarity or vulgar boorishness.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> To our twenty-first-century eyes, the meanings he proposed are not explicit, in part because we learn of them from truncated verbal descriptions and static images of isolated parts. Delsarte saw his system as one that was difficult for performers to learn, but easy for audiences to automatically interpret. If the combination of legible gestures and postures in motion worked semiotically, it was a motivated, not arbitrary, set of specific meanings. By organizing them into nine-fold charts, Delsarte—like the other great taxonomists of the eighteenth and nineteenth century—sorted nature into a manageable and totalizing order. From the chaos of human emotion, he offered an economy of expression.
    </p>
<p>
      Through acts of urban flânerie, Delsarte decoded a visual language that he believed would be useful both for actors on the professional stage and for viewers of everyday urban life. He began formulating his translation of universal body language when he noticed similarities between the thumbs of the dead and those of disaffected childcare workers. After visiting a dissecting-room where he realized the cadavers all had contracted thumbs, he strolled through the Tuileries, observing women holding babies. The “distracted and indifferent” nurses curled their thumbs towards the palm (like the hands of the dead), whereas the loving mothers had thumbs “bent violently outward.” The thumb’s position, he concluded, expressed the degree of life or affirmation. He suggested that such body language offered a built-in lie detector. If one was to ask a favor of a stranger, and the latter pulled in his thumb while answering “yes,” that small gesture showed the body dis-affirming the verbal statement; the stranger did not really  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> intend to perform as promised.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> In the same period, American etiquette writers similarly studied facial expressions, deportment, and clothing to discover true character. These indexes to sincerity, Karen Halttunen argues, were intended to ease the anxiety felt by the urban bourgeoisie when evaluating strangers and possible interlopers. But confidence men, actors, and the bourgeoisie alike studied human behavior and learned to imitate sincere emotion.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

      Such concerns about performing and reading affect through bodily gesture made the late nineteenth-century United States fertile ground for Delsartism, where it was substantially revised and became wildly popular, taken up by preachers, lawyers, politicians, actors, dancers, andrecreationists. The system was introduced by American actor and director Steele MacKaye when he returned from studying with the master himself. In the 1870s, Mackaye and his immediate followers—including oratory professor Lewis Baxter Monroe and Unitarian minister William R. Alger—retained the original emphasis on emotional expression for theatrical performances on stage or in the pulpit. However, within two generations of transmission from Delsarte, the practices, philosophy, teachers, and consumers of American Delsartism diverged from its paternal origin and application. By the 1880s, it evolved into eclectic forms of “aesthetic,” “rhythmic,” “harmonic,” or “society gymnastics” that combined the French system of theatrical expression with contemporary concerns about energy and health. It was increasingly  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> taught by women to other women, for exercise, enlightenment, and personal development rather than by men to men for professional theatrical expression. At the end of the nineteenth century, Delsarte’s best-known American practitioners were Genevieve Stebbins (1857–c. 1930) and Henrietta Russell (Hovey) (1849–1918); their reputations grew in the late 1880s and early 1890s when they were teaching primarily middle-aged, upper-class women. Other Delsarte teachers documented by Nancy Lee Chalfa Ruyter include Emily Montague Bishop (1858 – 1916), R. Anna Morris, Eva Allen Alberti, Eleanor Georgen, and Mary Perry King. (<span style="font-style:italic;">CBM</span>).
    </p>
<p>
      By the 1890s, professional performance of genuine emotional content was no longer the central goal. Instead, most American Delsarteans were interested in personal development, and the cultivation of physically attractive and “artistic” gestures in everyday life. During her 1892 visit to New York, Delsarte’s daughter Mme. Marie Géraldy found that although it was “very popular in young ladies’ seminaries and [. . .] clubs,” the added “convolutions” and “flourishes” bore little resemblance to her father’s method. She was not pleased: “I would rather my father were not known at all [. . .] than to be known as he is in your country, that is, as a professor of gymnastics.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Genevieve Stebbins did retain several aspects of traditional Delsartism, namely the nine-square charts of expression; Emanuel Swedenborg’s doctrine of correspondence, in which the invisible spiritual world was connected to the visible material world; the theosophical trinity of mind, body and soul; and the study and emulation of Greek sculpture in tableaux vivants. However, the Delsarte revisionists, of which Stebbins, Russell, and Bishop were the most recognized, also introduced several new elements drawn from an international sampling of health regimes and concerns, including Swedish Ling gymnastics, Eastern yoga, and anti-corset dress reform, leading to a new focus on conscientious breathing exercises. They and their followers further Americanized Delsartism by expanding it into a cure for neurasthenia, and a technique for impression management, sociologist Erving Goffman’s term for the cultivated intentional performance of public self.
    </p>
<p>
      In girls’ schools, women’s clubs, and private domestic settings, American Delsarteans addressed the health dangers specific to women who wore corsets that limited their physical activity, including their ability to breathe properly. Stebbins proposed to teach women how to achieve the “power in reserve” that she attributed to ancient Greek sculpture, regularly citing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Venus de Milo</span> as the ideal female torso. In the appendix to <span style="font-style:italic;">Dynamic Breathing and Harmonic Gymnastics</span> , Stebbins reproduced a dress reform tract by Sir William Henry Flower, Professor of Comparative Anatomy at the English Royal College of Surgeons [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. Flower contrasted the “deformed, fashionable re,” a corseted female body of 1880, to the uncompressed “artistic, natural female body” of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Venus</span>, suggesting the health dangers of the former and recommending the benefits and appearance of the latter.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Indirectly disparaging the intelligence of those women who preferred a tiny waist to efficient lungs, Stebbins called her un-corseted neoclassical aesthetic dress a “brain costume [. . .] because it takes brains to make and wear them.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Thus clothed, her followers could more easily perform the tableaux vivants or the melting pose-to-pose “tableaux mouvants” she  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> invented. Delsartean dress reform and expressive art-inspired exercises appealed to the tastes of elite women while counteracting the kinaesthetic of the constrained, conspicuously ornamented, and objectified female body, famously diagnosed as a symptom of American nouveau riche competitive materialism by sociologist Thorstein Veblen in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Theory of the Leisure Class</span>.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

      Beginning in the late 1880s, at the Chautauqua summer recreation camps for weary east coast urbanites, Emily Bishop led attendees in many of the same physical movements of Stebbins’s Delsartism while helping to take this body culture further toward the goal of self-improvement. Instead of equating emotions and expressive verbal phrases with particular physical gestures, Bishop focused on improving the health of those who desperately needed to learn how to relax in order to be more energetic:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	Overwrought, nervous Americans have special need to learn “the gospel of relaxation.” From the cradle to the grave, excitation and strained exertion are the order of most lives. In school, children are urged to injurious nervous efforts in their studies that a high per cent. may be attained. [ . . . ] After school come the drive and the strife of the competitive systems of society and business; the nerves are kept constantly alert in the struggle for wealth, for position, or many times, for the necessities of life. Thus “the pace that kills” has become common with modern men and women.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Bishop’s rhetoric shows that American Delsartism fit into the late nineteenth-century “therapeutic world view” that sought to cure what contemporaries called neurasthenia or nervousness, and that historians have connected to the repressive effects of urban, bourgeois, and increasingly industrialized western culture.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The latter-day Delsarteans promoted their artistic exercises as a response to the modernized lifestyle of competitive but inefficient over-productivity, which incubated nervous deterioration in its subjects.
    </p>
<p>
      Seen in this context, American Delsartism seems “anti-modern,” part of the broader movement that sought a return to authentic, organic, and essential experience, as described by T.J. Jackson Lears in <span style="font-style:italic;">No Place of Grace</span>. Certainly, Stebbins’s aesthetic chitons and philhellenic tableaux vivants gave American Delsartism a reactionary façade, but it was built on a contrived notion of the ancient “natural” body that was no more authentically accessible to the late nineteenth-century New Yorker than was landscaped Central Park a genuine wilderness. Rather, as Hillel Schwartz convincingly argues in his groundbreaking essay, “Torque: The New Kinaesthetic of the Twentieth Century,” French and American Delsartism fit into a cluster of body culture activities that were created <span style="font-style:italic;">in reaction against and in relation to</span> social modernity’s rationalized mechanization of the body into isolated parts. The “current wisdom” that “we have managed speed but not coherence, repetition but not meaning, isolation but not independence, juxtaposition but not integrity,” in the twentieth-century western experience of the body, is only one part of the equation. This critique of the mechanized body assumes a solution: alternate “ideals of movement” that were themselves a distinctly modern approach to the body. These alternate kinaesthetic ideals, found in Delsartism, modern dance, penmanship, zippers, artificial limbs, and other techniques, were articulated and explored in “full-bodied” and fluid movements that function to both reveal and contribute to the making of a unique sense of self. A fragmented sense of the body, Schwartz argues, led to the search for an aesthetic and expressive kinaesthetic, and thus a kinaesthetic that was simultaneously opposed to modernity and constitutive of modernism.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> This argument is very useful for modulating Lears’s “anti-modernist” claim, but I want to suggest here that it could go even farther towards finding areas of cohesion between the dichotomous kinaesthetics of industrial efficiency and artistic expressiveness.
    </p>
<p>
      Such cohesion is suggested by recent scholarship that situates turn-of-the-century Delsartism within the distinctly modern and linked cultures of “will” and “personality” that responded to the epidemic of nervousness and fragmentation with self-disciplined body culture practices. Although the expressivist concept of “personality” is usually seen as the antithesis of the modes of self-discipline that characterized earlier ideals of authentic character, the body cultures of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries demonstrate a mode of expressivity premised on restraint. In his study of the German “cult of the will,” Michael Cowan charts a broader western movement that “sought to transform mental states through bodily performance” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CW</span>, 119). Rather than seeing neurasthenia as the problem of an over-intellectualized body, many body culture proponents viewed the problem as one of:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	the overwhelming presence of a body in excess, one whose nervous tics, twitches, spasms, pains, cramps, convulsions, and paralyses refused to obey the dictates of the will [. . .] learning to control the excessively nervous body was a key ingredient in the fantasy of regaining control over a modern world that no longer allowed it.
      </p>
<div class="attrib">
	(<span style="font-style:italic;">CW</span>, 113)
      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Cowan thus argues “in opposition to the oft-repeated contention that early twentieth-century reform programs constituted a ‘rediscovery’ of the body after its ‘suppression’ under nineteenth-century rationalism.” Instead “these programs were driven by precisely the opposite imaginary project; that of taming a rebellious, nervous body in excess” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CW</span>, 17). Containment strengthened and calmed the body, thus readying it for action.
      </p>
<p>
	Physical self-control, including the kind practiced by American Delsarteans, would in turn cultivate not only beauty but also emotional self-possession, and eventually the projection of self-confidence (<span style="font-style:italic;">CW</span>, 153). Whereas Delsarte originally identified inherent and essential gestures of authentic emotion, revisionists like Russell, Mary Perry King, and poet Bliss Carman re-purposed the study of gesture and comportment to serve the construction of malleable public persona. Drawing on Goffman’s theory of the “presentation of self in everyday life,” Ann Daly suggests that in the first decade of the twentieth century, “like an actor in rehearsal, the Delsartean sought to master the techniques of performance” through repetitive drills, an approach that she sees as disciplinary and repressive, in contrast to Schwartz’s position.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> This quality of rationalizing, fragmenting, and reintegrating kinaesthetic movement, controlling the body, and remaking the personality through conscientious physical practice, was essential to the twentieth-century versions of Delsarte body culture.
      </p>
<p>
	At the turn of the century, Delsartism branched into two directions, modern dance and physical culture. In the United States, Delsartism was carried forward by modern dance pioneers Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis (1879–1968), and Ted Shawn (1891– 1972). Their philosophy and choreography borrowed from the traditional Delsarte lexicon by reproducing art historical imagery and reaching for emotional epiphany through expressive movement. Thanks to their work, Delsartism was extended into twentieth-century dance choreography and the gestural vocabulary of silent film acting. <a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> This trajectory is well known in the scholarship on modern kinaesthetics, but the corresponding physical culture branch of Delsartism, such as that practiced by Bess M. Mensendieck, is less familiar. Before looking in detail at the latter, a quick review of Delsartism’s status within the emerging professional field of physical education will suggest how an artificial dichotomy between bodily expression and muscular efficiency conceptually pushed apart elements that were actually quite similar in practice.
      </p>
<p>
	The impact of Americanized Delsartism on physical culture education is virtually unknown because even as it was occurring, Delsarteans were apologizing for their wayward practitioners and physical education promoters were distancing themselves from its embarrassingly effete reputation. Stebbins acknowledged a split between these groups in the early 1890s. At that time, some of her students were, much to her disappointment, “present[ing] the public with a distortion of psycho-physical culture,”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> which contributed to the raging debate between “the defenders of artistic grace” and “the advocates of muscle.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> When Delsarte teachers Emily M. Bishop and Franklin H. Sargent went before the American Association for the Advancement of Physical Education (AAAPE) in 1892, they anticipated—and mostly found—a hostile audience.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Bishop acknowledged that:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  many persons are prejudiced against any teaching that bears the name Delsarte, because they believe that all Delsarte teaching arbitrarily prescribes certain ways to do certain things. [. . .] No wonder that practical teachers of other systems of physical education shrug their shoulders and smile contemptuously at such nonsense; so do practical Delsarte teachers.
	</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Despite this unfortunate reputation, she insisted, Delsartism is not a series of “arbitrary” poses that “would rob people of all spontaneity, all individuality, would make them mere automatons” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 81). Rather, it promotes relaxation, efficient movements, and genuine personal expression. Turning from negative to positive mechanical metaphors, Bishop subtly reminded her listeners of Delsarte’s original engine-like “law for control: ‘strength at the center, freedom at the surface,’” and explicitly referred to strong bodies as “good machines [that] in themselves are not enough. In order to save these machines from tear and to make them wear well, we must know how to run them with the least amount of friction” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 84–85). Delsartism could provide this lesson, turning muscle into productivity through proper movement. Despite Bishop’s efforts to show the functional value of Delsarte movements, Harvard physical education innovator Dudley A. Sargent was unconvinced. Delsartism, he responded bluntly, “is not a system of physical training and you cannot make it so in any way.” Unlike the Swedish Ling gymnastics, which he favored, Delsartism was useless because it does not cultivate muscular “bodily vigor”; from his perspective, the two approaches to health were “diametrically opposed” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 89). J. Madison Taylor of Philadelphia was more optimistic; he saw through superficial differences and mirrored one of the core principles of American Delsartism—“grace is the economy of force” (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 85)—when he added:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  I think we have grasped the fact that the animus is to bring the greatest possible efficiency and grace to persons who have bad muscular habits. These two systems, which are traveling in parallel lines, may, I think, safely inosculate.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">AAAPE</span>, 93–94)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
	  Although Bess Mensendieck’s system was not widely known in the American physical education community before the 1930s, it may be considered the marriage of the “advocates of muscle” to the “defenders of artistic grace” that Taylor predicted at the 1892 AAAPE meeting. The Mensendieck system merged goals of muscular efficiency and expressive grace, and in turn contributed to both dance and physical education of the twentieth century. Elizabeth Marguerite de Varel Mensendieck (c.1866–1959), better known as Bess M. Mensendieck, was a Dutch American<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> who studied Delsartism with Stebbins prior to forging her own exercise system. The “Mensendieck System of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Functional Exercises” was designed to maximize the efficiency of the “human machine and mechanisms through which it functions.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Her approach was physiological: not psychological, not spiritual, not emotional. In the only book-length study of American Delsartism published to date, Nancy Lee Chalfa Ruyter observes that Stebbins’s followers (including Mensendieck) contributed to early twentieth-century German modern dance and physical culture but with a significant difference: “The emphasis was [. . .] on the facility and quality of movement rather than on the Delsartean canon of expressive gestures or attitudes.” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CBM,</span> 71). In the long run however, it served a new kind of expressivity, forged through a new degree of bodily efficiency.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck did not agree with most physical education drills and sports, but she also thought that expressive and aesthetic gymnastics were superficial, unscientific, and insulting to women’s intelligence. Particularly disturbing to Mensendieck were Stebbins’s metaphysical additions, which she called “loads of blooming rubbish.” She aimed to strip away this “curse of ridiculousness” and restore the underlying principles of Delsarte and Ling muscular control without their “metaphysical squiggles.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In addition to rejecting Delsartism’s attachment to archaic universal spiritual and emotional meanings, Mensendieck later differentiated her rationalized physical culture system from the expressive avant-garde modern dance of Weimar Germany and interwar America. “It is not by cultivating bizarre and exaggerated types of dance movements that bodily perfection is to be attained” nor could it “be acquired by a so-called ‘expressionism,’ which, through bodily contortions, gives rein to a fancy even less esthetic than are the movements themselves.” Citing Nietzche, she forwarded bodily discipline, rather than the soul, as the origin of and route to self-discovery and graceful kinaesthetic style.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck’s system came to public attention through her role in Kaiser Wilhelm II’s court, a network of schools, and a series of publications in German, Dutch, and English. The Kaiser hired her to improve the posture of courtiers who “in an effort to appease him, whenever they stood at attention in his presence [. . .] folded their hands over their bulging abdomens. This posture made them look like fantastic beer-mugs, a sight which vexed Wilhelm further.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Between 1905 and 1924, Mensendieck and her followers established schools in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland, Holland, France, Czechoslovakia, and the United States.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> John Martin, the leading modern dance critic in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century, commended Mensendieck for her influence on German modern dance in a 1929 <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> article:

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    It is [. . .] in the work of Bess Mensendieck that the romantic—or if you will, the modern— dance theory finds its completion. Like Isadora, an American far better known and valued abroad than at home, Dr. Mensendieck took her stand against vicarious experience. In her scheme of themes this did not concern esthetic or emotional problems, but simple physical ones. The dance was not her interest, but through her development of a new and radical method of physical education the dance has profited incalculably. It is no secret that most of the modern German physical culture dancing is a direct outgrowth of her pioneering.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  The “romantic theory” of modern dance (as Martin called it), was associated most prominently with Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis in the U.S., and in Europe with Rudolf Bode, Émile Jacque-Dalcroze, Rudolf von Laban, and Mary Wigman. They valued the “expression of personally felt emotional experience,” Martin remarked.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> He also recognized that although this was not Mensendieck’s goal, her work was a formidable and formative element in expressive and artistic kinaesthetic modernism.
	</p>
<p>
	  During the first two decades when the Mensendieck system was spreading rapidly through northern Europe, its growth in the United States was happening at a slower and less-publicized pace. In 1937, its founder blamed the American Comstock obscenity laws for having restricted her ability to lecture, teach, or publish with the necessary nude demonstrations (<span style="font-style:italic;">MSFE</span>, xi), but there is evidence that in the 1910s she and her followers were giving clothed lessons at schools for young women, and nude private instruction in New York City, even before she established the Mensendieck Central Institute there in 1923.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> American versions of her publications were delayed until the 1931 release of <span style="font-style:italic;">“It’s Up to You”</span>, which features res partially clothed, thanks to the photographic retoucher. In the 1930s, she was teaching on the modern dance faculty at the New School for Social Research in New York and Boston University while publishing American volumes featuring her students’ accomplishments in the United States.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> In 1937, the system was employed at Yale and other “eminently respectable schools” in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and had “won over 200,000 disciples, two-thirds of them women” worldwide, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">Time Magazine</span>. <a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Although the system was originally designed for adult women, students who went on to teach her system in the U.S. passed it on to diverse publics, including young athletes, dancers, physical education instructors, and elite women and businessmen who wanted better poise.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck started her exercise system with a goal shared by other Delsarteans; she wanted to make the human body into an art form. In the 1890s, she moved to Paris and took studio courses in sculpting clay from life. Carrying on the Delsartist ideal of Greek bodies, she was critical of the models’ res and comportment. In contrast to the perfected bodies in Hellenic art, the models had heavy thighs, puffy arms, narrow chest carriage, and jerking movements. “If some models could have the beautiful lines of masterful Greek statues why couldn’t others?” she wondered. “To be sure, not everyone could be a Venus or an Adonis, but it seemed that many did not develop the full potentialities of their bodies.” Recognizing this unrealized capacity for health and beauty, Mensendieck decided to become a “sculptor in flesh.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Instead of translating living bodies into static art, she would re-shape bodies into living art.
	</p>
<p>
	  Despite this original continuity with Delsartism, Mensendieck’s approach to kinaesthetics turned increasingly scientific and intellectual because of her encounter with French physiological studies and her orientation within the culture of will power (discussed above). She left art school and enrolled in the Medical College in Paris, eventually finishing her degree at the University of Zurich. While at the Medical College in Paris, she worked in the lab of the late Dr. Guillaume B. Duchenne de Boulogne (1806–1875). Duchenne’s lab electrically stimulated human muscles in order  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to determine their function, an approach called the “Physiology of Motion” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 5–6). Like Delsarte, Duchenne was codifying emotional expression, but purely on the basis of muscle action. By applying electrical current directly to his subjects’ heads, he determined which muscles changed facial expression from a grimace to a smile and back again. Instead of reading the body for external signs of emotion as Stebbins had taught her to do, Mensendieck learned to correlate movement—even the appearance of emotion—with muscle stimulation from the nervous system. As she recalled years later, Duchenne’s experiments prompted her curiosity: “If an electric current stimulated the muscle into action,” she wondered, “could not the brain do as much? Could not the will power of the individual be used to stimulate specific, neglected muscles? If will power were exerted and the muscle brought into use, what influence would this have upon the muscle shape?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 5–7). The influence of that lab appears when she employed electrical stimulation as a metaphor for will power, asserting “no artificial device can equal in strength, in delicacy and in efficiency the power of the will-current which the brain is able to send through the nerves to stimulate the muscles to act” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 27). It was in this period that Mensendieck developed her understanding of the relationship of muscular, skeletal, and neurological systems, and began to focus on the relationship between these systems and proprioception, which is the body’s internal sense of movement through space, a key component of kinaesthetics.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck’s system tested the power of the mind to retrain muscles and thus reshape bodies for better health and greater beauty, and eventually higher freedom. Instead of a stated emotional or spiritual motivation, her system would be driven by the intellect. There was no place in her program for the Delsartean goal of teaching the body to expressively mirror the emotions. Neither did she tolerate the dumb muscle stimuli of Duchenne’s experiments. Instead of equating gestures with emotions, Mensendieck identified the smoothest, most concise, and most energy-enhancing ways to sit, rise, stand, walk, bend, lift, and breathe. Then, using this knowledge, she helped students learn how to “make his intelligence the engineer for running his body machine <span style="font-style:italic;">according to the mechanical laws established by nature</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MSFE</span>, 16). In contrast to the expressive and spiritual character of Stebbins’s American Delsartism, the Mensendieck system was intellectual, scientific, and pragmatic.
	</p>
<p>
	  American Delsarteans helped the overstressed to relax, but Mensendieck blamed slumped relaxation for weakening bodies. People needed to cultivate vigilant self-awareness, self-control, and increased muscular tension, not its opposite. Mensendieck saw her system as a cure for the ugly bodies damaged by modern dress, work posture, bad diet, and lack of exercise. The habits of everyday life eroded the body’s efficiency, creating poor body mass alignments that had long-term damaging effects. Like other feminist health reformers, she crusaded against “that worst of all autocrats—Madame La Corsetiere.” Women’s bodies suffered new problems with post-corset freedom. Accustomed to an external support, their back and abdominal muscles were weak, and their bellies bulged out when they exhaled.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> “Wearing abnormally-shaped shoes” that caused wearers to put too much weight on the heel or on the toe damaged posture, as did the casual stance of “standing, slumped sideways, with more weight on one leg  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> than the other” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 38). Photographic illustrations from her American publications identify a population whose enjoyment of cigarettes, telephones, and fur coats comes with the casual physical self-presentation associated with kinaesthetic modernity, according to Peter Stearns’s work on the history of posture.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> The incorrect bodies slouch, bellies and chins thrust forward, knees locked, and calves hyper-extended to the rear. In her 1937 volume, Mensendieck chides her photographed subject [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]: “Does the mere act of lighting a cigarette call for such a general displacement of body-masses— such ugly outlines?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MSFE</span>, 10). The solution was a holistic and constant mind-body renovation, accomplished by intentional muscular tonicity. She advocated training the body and mind to work together to make self-conscious muscle placement and movement through space into learned and automatic habit. With proper breathing, posture, and movements, the muscles could be re-educated so that the relationship between nervous system, bone structure, and musculature worked together.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mensendieck promoted an efficiency of movement engaged with the new industrial streamlined sense of the body’s mobile power. The body was a machine, an engine, a work of architecture. Describing the body in these terms filled what she saw as a linguistic void: “WE HAVE NO LANGUAGE FOR DESCRIBING BODILY MOVEMENT,” she lamented (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 2). Consequently, writers who wanted to describe grace in motion employed meaningless clichés or gave up entirely, instead praising famously graceful res like the actress Eleanora Duse for her “essentially spiritual” performances. “No matter how spiritual the message,” Mensendieck reminded her readers, “the body must be the carrier of that message” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 3). Like other machines, the body machine deserved “labor saving” efforts to prevent the “wasteful use of muscular energy” that occurs “when we bring into use groups of muscles which are not required for the act to be performed” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 27). Mensendieck wanted to reduce such waste, and prevent the unnecessary fatigue everyday movements caused. This was a matter of retraining the body into a better servant and retraining the mind into a better master. In an illustration of a “too close approach” to opening a cabinet door [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>], Mensendieck faulted the model’s posture but also blamed her brain for sending an inefficient “order” that caused “multiple ‘detours’ of muscular energy” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 146). Determining and using the right muscles in correct sequence with smooth timing, which Mensendieck called “physiological rhythm,” was an essential component in achieving efficiency, poise, and shapeliness (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 33–35).
	</p>
<p>
	  Because muscular realignment could not occur without seeing how the body worked, Mensendieck discarded Delsartism’s Grecian tunics and instituted more effective methods for visual inspection of muscular function: nudity and mirrors. In her physical culture treatises and in her classrooms, Mensendieck teachers and students worked naked or clothed only for the barest modesty, so that no muscles, tonic or slack, evaded view. The exercises were performed in rooms equipped with two mirrors, one parallel to the front of the body, and the other at an angle that allowed the exerciser to see her opposite side reflected in the front mirror [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>]. The two mirrors “train the eye to be the guardian which ‘polices’ the body, which locates the truant muscles that habitually shirk their functions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MSFE</span>, 69). Like other modern forms of discipline,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	  in the Mensendieck system, the body was rationalized and inspected by the supervisor (teacher) and by the supervised, who learned how to self-regulate. Clearly Mensendieck’s pedagogical methods fall within Foucault’s regimes of normalization, but cultural circumstances suggest alternate meanings as well.
	</p>
<p>
	  Although the teachers inspected students’ nude bodies and coached them towards physical uniformity, it was not the “impossible surrender” some imagined, according to a student who studied Mensendieck techniques at Hedwig Hagemann’s school in Germany. Rather, there was nothing more beautiful than to observe and correct one’s own body. Through such efforts, even the imperfectly built re could achieve beauty and harmony through elastic and energetic movement, but the power to make such changes were held by “the person alone, he alone has it in his hand” and only accessed by contemplating one’s unclothed reflection. “[One] must go to this naked moment,” the young woman wrote, to win physical, spiritual, and emotional freedom.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> This pronudity student was the Norwegian-born dancer Fé Alf (1910–1996) who immigrated to the United States in 1931 and promoted body culture for pregnant women, the most significantly feminist and eugenic aspects of Mensendieck’s program. Alf’s perspective reflects her training in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span>-influenced Hagemann school. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span> combined back-to-nature nude dance and athletic recreation in outdoor settings with notions of feminist self-determination, self-discipline, and increased labor productivity.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> It was a reaction to the mechanization and rationalization of modern life, and intended to open the body for experiences of “freedom of identity and action,” both individually and collectively beneficial, especially for women, argues historian Karl Toepfer (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 10–11). Thus, like other body cultures that yoked efficiency and expression, Toepfer  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> finds that “<span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span> consistently presented itself as a sign of modernity and an aspect of modernism rather than as a reaction against both” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 31). Mensendieck did not connect nudity to nature appreciation, as did her <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span> contemporaries and some of her students, notably Hagemann and Alice Bloch, but she did share its belief in freedom through discipline. In her thinking, nudity increased productivity through rationalization and control of the body’s systems and movements, which would ultimately result in greater agency and self-realization.
	</p>
<p>
	  In a cultural formation parallel to the earlier Americanization of Delsartism, Mensendieck practitioners turned a rational system of movement into personality development, thus merging efficiency and expression. Mensendieck signaled this ethos when she titled her 1931 U. S. publication <span style="font-style:italic;">“It’s Up to You”</span>, a culturally-relevant shift from the earlier <span style="font-style:italic;">Körperkultur der Frau</span> (Physical Culture for Women). In the later American text, she wrote that having “trained himself to hold in mind, consciously, until it shall have become <span style="font-style:italic;">second-nature</span>, an ideal of the most perfect way to perform movement,” a person was, like a skilled writer or public speaker, ready to give graceful form to meaning (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 31). “Correct automatisms” facilitated full-bodied and individual expression: “the power of the soul, which animates the face, also permeates the entire body; [and] bodies differ in expression as much as faces. The personality is expressed by the individual as a whole, not by his face alone” (<span style="font-style:italic;">IUTY</span>, 33, 32). In the early 1940s, Fé Alf was teaching Mensendieck body mechanics and poise at Donu Edmond’s House of Prana, a “New York beauty establishment.” The “psychological factor of looking well” dominated press coverage of Alf’s lessons and the appended Lane Bryant maternity-wear fashion shows held at the House of Prana.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> The beauty spa’s name is a play on words that encapsulates the trajectory from Delsarte’s spiritually-inflected mid-nineteenth-century program to the personality-oriented early twentieth-century versions of American Delsarte and Mensendieck body cultures. In the yogic tradition, prana is the “breath of life,” energy that circulates in the air, and the solar plexus is considered the “store-house of prana.” The adjusted phrase implies a fashion designer’s atelier (e.g., House of Worth, House of Chanel).<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Like Stebbins, Edmond appropriated eastern spirituality to turn exercise into western confidence building.
	</p>
<p>
	  Edmond hired Alf to help women, pregnant or not, to build strength, trim fat, suit their demeanor to clothing, and manage their public impressions. During the fall of 1941, the pregnant Alf taught other expectant mothers how to perform everyday movements such as “standing, stooping, reaching and lifting” safely and with grace: “When you stretch to smooth the far corner of your bed, pull yourself stiff and keep your whole body in a straight line.” In the accompanying photo, her right leg is impressively extended in an elevated arabesque while her arm reaches in the opposite direction to pull the bedclothes taut. She explained this pose in terms of body mechanics. One should “Extend one leg for balance, in order to distribute the effort of the movement over as many parts of your body as possible.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> There were also lessons in how to kinaesthetically negotiate non-domestic terrain. For example, Edmond’s press release promised that any woman who attended Alf’s course would learn  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    how to enter a crowded lobby or dining room and either attract attention of every man and woman there, or enter inconspicuously and unnoticed according to her desire[. . .] . [W]e must be aware of our inner selves, of how we look, what we are and the impression we are creating by our movements, and not trust to luck.
	  </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  By controlling one’s every move, adjusted according to one’s wardrobe, hair-do, and make-up of the moment, women could “create an effect in harmony with what they are or to develop into what they want to be.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Frankfurt School and Foucauldian analyses of mechanized and disciplined corporeality are immeasurably useful and important, but they have made it difficult to see how such kinaesthetic practices ever could be genuinely expressive and individualized. Certainly, the body cultures under discussion here may have cultivated a false sense of consciousness, interiority, or self-possession that worked to motivate or sedate workers and consumers. However, it is worth considering how the American Delsarte and Mensendieck practices attempted to achieve kinesthetic freedom by uniting the values of industrial modernity and artistic modernism.
	</p>
<p>
	  Recent philosophers and historians, namely Richard Shusterman, Michael Cowan, Michael Hau, and Tim Armstrong, have argued that self-conscious body mechanics and orthopedics programs, such as those taught by F. Matthias Alexander, the American Posture League, Mensendieck and others in this period, facilitated individualized aesthetic sensitivity and liberated self-control.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Body consciousness is not always anxiety about exposure, surveillance, criticism, and lack of control. In the body cultures under discussion here, physical self-discipline could be a way of cultivating or maintaining agency, just as neurasthenia could be a way of refusing discipline. Although such orderly bodily techniques conflict with current notions that kinesthetic freedom is uncontrolled and spontaneous movement (akin to the ideologies of the free market, free will, and consumer choice), in the same way that mastering verbal language gives us the flexibility to express ourselves fluidly, somatic programs like those discussed here provided a stable base from which bodily improvisation was not only possible but empowered. Both promoted rationalized and disciplined movement as the premise for individual expressivity.
	</p>
<p>
	  The trajectory from Delsarte expression to Mensendieck exercise, as it evolved in the United States, demonstrates a cultural negotiation between disciplinary efficiency, and emancipatory expressiveness. Although the original French Delsarte system of rhetorical gesture was highly rationalized and furthermore, informed by the distinctly modern urban experience of observing and assessing strangers, American Delsarteans transformed it into women’s “society gymnastics” that cured neurasthenia and cultivated personal appearance. This provided the basis for early twentieth-century modern dance choreography, the sine qua non of expressive embodied modernism, but the Mensendieck physical culture system was a simultaneous and complementary offshoot. Promoting health in terms of engineered muscular efficiency, her nude body-mechanics rehabilitation program espoused repetitive self-discipline as the necessary route to liberated individuality. Its historical position, between the values of scientific management and those associated with the movement practices that came out of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> American Delsartism, illuminates unforeseen similarities between those two body cultures, namely the rationalization of movement in service of individual expression. Recognizing this shared territory repositions the mechanized kinaesthetic of social modernity in relation to the expressive body cultures associated with artistic modernism; they existed in co-existed in intimate and even collaborative tension, not simply in opposition to one another.

These contemporary historians of early twentieth-century <span style="font-style:italic;">Nacktkultur</span> insist that German nudist physical culture contributed to, but was neither directly responsible for nor exclusively attractive to the developing Nazi philosophy of nationalist racial hygiene. Mensendieck’s League for Better Bodies, established in 1924 and mentioned in “Finds Beauty Lies in Muscle Control,” invites analysis on how German and American eugenics programs intersected, but the topic is too complex to address here, other than to warn readers against a reductive interpretation.
