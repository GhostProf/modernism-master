<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What are the rewards, challenges, and risks of innovation in general? Is there necessarily an inherent value in “making it new” in pedagogy?</span></p>
<p>
      Like some of the other respondents—Marsha Bryant and Suzanne Churchill with their “periodical pedagogy” or David Earle in his deployment of MySpace in the classroom—I find that my teaching often involves the juxtaposing of canonical texts and items drawn from the popular and extra-artistic reaches of culture. In general, I try to make things new for my students the old-fashioned way—by addressing and readdressing the contemporary pertinence of the texts that we read. In particular, I am most interested in having my students see the persistence of the formal innovations of modernism—the way that certain strains of irony, estrangement, and montage developed during the modernist period are still central to aesthetic creation today. The shows and movies that we see, the news that we watch at night, and even many of the websites that play an increasingly important role in our lives all bear the marks of modernist influence, however indirect or subtle.
    </p>
<p>
      When I happen upon just the right contemporary analogue, this tactic of mine seems to be very effective. The past and present bring each other into sharp focus as an apparently arcane literary form comes to appear familiar, already a part of my students’ everyday experiences of media and entertainment, yet something they suddenly feel empowered to understand and describe. (It would probably be too much to compare the effect to Walter Benjamin’s concept of the “dialectical image,” but perhaps the same sort of idea is at play.)<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The students speak  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> more excitedly when things are opened up this way, and when we turn back to Joyce or Eliot or Woolf, the excitement tends to persist. The classroom becomes a happier and more productive place. And amidst all this engagement and interest, and without saying a word about it, I begin to get very deeply worried.
    </p>
<p>
      The best way to show why I am so worried is to tell a story. Last year I decided to open a course on modern European fiction by showing a set of advertisements stored on YouTube that had been on my mind during the last weeks of the summer.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> They seemed to me uncannily good evocations of some of the principal stances of modernist narrative form, complete works viewable in 30 seconds that would bring my students face to face with the issues of technique and tone that would preoccupy us all semester.
    </p>
<p>
      The best one of all is a brilliant spot directed by the filmmaker Spike Jonze for IKEA. Soapy, maudlin piano music plays as we watch a woman unplug the tired reading lamp that sits on a side table next to her sofa and carry it out to the curb for garbage pickup. The camera angle shifts to impersonate the perspective of the lamp itself, as it takes its last look at its comfortable home, staring back at the shut front door and finally, during a dark and stormy night, watching its former mistress reading under the light of a brand new lamp, which she caresses softly before turning in for the night. We get a bit wrapped up in the scene, so cunningly is it shot, until, just as the music comes to its melodramatic crescendo, an odd-looking man with what seems to be a Swedish accent strolls into the shot, looks into the camera, and addresses us directly: “Many of you feel bad for this lamp. That is because you’re crazy. It has no feelings. And the new one is much better.”
    </p>
<p>
      It’s a great joke, of course, and a great vehicle for IKEA’s long-standing (and, in a sense, modernist, if cynically so) pitch: you won’t really stop being a child so long as your home is full of your parents’ old furniture, so throw it all out, head to IKEA and make it (your apartment, yourself) new. But the usefulness of the ad as a means to open a window on modernist form extends beyond its message. Via this advertisement and our discussions of it, my students received a working sense of montage, Brechtian estrangement and shock, and what we might call generic impersonation—that is, what it means for a work to sell itself as, in this case, a soap opera, only to snap back against the viewer suffering along with the lamp at the end of the spot. And since we would start in on <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame Bovary</span> during the next meeting, the overall tactic of the ad opened the complicated concept of the <span style="font-style:italic;">style indirect libre</span> in a way that I have never been able to do as clearly via blackboard diagramming and patient explanation.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Beyond the first day of class, this advertisement, as well as the others that I showed that day, came to serve as touchstones that my students and I would constantly return to as we took up the difficult works of Proust and Kafka, Benjamin and Calvino. But despite the fact that my tactic seemed pedagogically effective, the ease of translation from the one form to the other—from the canonical text to the contemporary advertisement—struck me as increasingly disturbing. What does it say about the texts and methods to which I’ve devoted my working life when their principles of construction are exposed as the secret sharers of the slickest practices of contemporary branding campaigns?
    </p>
<p>
      In short, my small effort to make it new in my classroom provoked much larger  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> questions about the purpose of making it new during the reign of modernism. When the code of Flaubert’s prose can be broken by a television spot bent on selling us a cheap new lamp, what are we left to think about <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame Bovary</span>? Whatever it is that we believe we are doing in the classroom as we teach modernism, I would bet that most of us retain a deep sense that these texts and the formal innovations that “made them new” retain some degree of critical efficacy—that their ability to estrange and reveal the under-workings of modern life remains, despite our increasing distance from their moment of composition. The fact that modernist form can be separated from what we might think of as a properly modernist project threw the texts and tactics that I work on into an abruptly ambiguous light.
    </p>
<p>
      There is, however, a solution to my problem, even if it is one that is far easier to describe than to put into practice. Faced with such doubts, I should have thematized them—brought them into the course itself as an issue for class discussion. After all, the uneasy relationship between modernism and marketing has been a long-standing issue of investigation for modernists and scholars of modernism alike—from the Soviet Constructivists’ avant-garde posters to Jennifer Wicke’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertising Fictions</span> and Frederic Jameson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Postmodernism.</span><a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
      But even beyond the literary-historical issue, there is an even more fundamental educational opportunity at hand in this situation. The self-reflexivity of understanding—the ability to see ourselves seeing, to read ourselves as we read—is perhaps the greatest skill we who teach literature can help our students obtain—and it is one best taught by practicing it ourselves. As we experiment with new tactics of teaching modernism, we must be ready for and open to the untimely questions and unforeseen openings that emerge from our innovative techniques.
