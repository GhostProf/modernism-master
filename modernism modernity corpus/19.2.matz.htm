Another letter recounts a woman’s dream of washing clothes in a creek with her baby standing nearby and throwing pebbles into the water. Seeing she had forgotten to bring soap, the woman went to get some, only to discover upon her return the baby “lying face down in the water” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">MT</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 225). She awoke with a “wave of joy” to see her baby safe, but then, months later, was astonished to find herself actually doing washing by a creek with her baby at her side—without soap, too, but forewarned by her dream against leaving her baby alone. One man wrote to Priestley telling how his brother had dreamt in detail about his own funeral: “He had dreamt of a funeral cortege, of the mourners, the bearers with red and white flowers, even me wearing a wide black hat” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">MT</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 324). Not long after, “he got a bad kick on the football field, it turned to peritonitis, he died, and his funeral was exactly as he had dreamed it—the red and white flowers, his football club colours—and it passed through the same streets, everything the same as in his dream.” </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:47px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Other precognitions were less portentous: for example, one of “an Indian canoe </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">sailing across the Town Hall Square” which turned out nine years later to be theatrical </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-left:31px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">scenery in transit.

He had been called “a leader second in importance only to Mr. Churchill” in 1940 by Graham Greene, in recognition of his inspiring and daring wartime radio broadcasts, and the public arena had also seen him active as a soldier in the First World War, as a founder of the Authors National Committee (which found ways for writers to pitch in during the Second World War), and as a leader in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Even if F. R. Leavis had announced that “life isn’t long enough to permit of one’s giving much time to Fielding or any to Mr. Priestley,” and even despite “the myth of the hard-headed and coarse-grained Yorkshireman who knew exactly what the public liked and who gave them it,” Priestley in 1963 had become (in the words of one critic) “the most widely-known of all living English writers: the only one whose name can produce beams of recognition among readers from Liverpool to Los Angeles, Sydney to Smollensk, and so on through the alphabet and around the world.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">All of which is significant here for the way it makes Priestley’s 1963 television appearance a kind of culmination, for himself and for a more widespread form of public performance. Challenging time on television, Priestley was making no new departure, but linking together his signature pursuits and postures into a significant cultural intervention. Popular performance, temporal experiment, social leadership, and middlebrow zeal together marshaled a campaign to regain time itself, and, in so doing, redeem English society. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">It may have been the only thing he and Woolf had in common. Priestley was not alone in his bid to transform public temporal possibilities. Woolf as well as a host of modernist writers sought to make such a difference to time; temporal redemption achieved through aesthetic form was integral to modernist invention. Of course, we know full well that the modernists experimented with time, but their experiments are known as efforts at experiential or theoretical verisimilitude, efforts to represent or to theorize the real experience of time. But they also—more characteristically, even—had designs upon time. Beyond any interest in reflecting the truth about it, they tried to intervene in the reality of time, to reclaim or transform temporalities destroyed or enabled by modernity. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In other words, they had what we might call </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">ecological </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">motives.

To say this project took place in the “theater of time” is at once to capture the militancy of Priestley’s campaign and to name the aesthetic mode through which he thought “multiple time” might be performed. For Priestley, drama was the theater in which to fight for time and chart temporal territory for a “New Britain.” His “time plays”—</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Time and the Conways </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1937), </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">An Inspector Calls </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1946), and others—dem</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">onstrate those practices of precognition, “future influencing present,” and other forms of multiple time that were for Priestley key to vital cultural transformations. Beyond that, however, what he called “dramatic experience” had a closer and more essential relationship to temporal freedom, making the theater a space in which the temporali</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ties Priestley thematized in his plays could transfer into real public advantages. As I will show, the theory of time Priestley promotes in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Man and Time</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"> corresponds to the theory of dramatic experience he presents in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">The Art of the Dramatist </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1957) and other critical statements. Dramatic experience and “multiple time” share a structure, which would make Priestley’s time-plays a new pattern for English society. Correlations among time, drama, and freedom make the theater a space for aesthetic experience that is also political action, a central proving ground for modernist time ecology. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Priestley claimed always to have been “time-haunted,” compelled “every few years to vanish into the mazes of the Time problem, returning, rather worn, with a play or a story.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>6 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">It was in 1927, however, that he found new and enduring inspiration for this obsession.

Other theorists would influence him greatly as well (mainly P. D.

In dreams, a secondary consciousness transcends the present moment and ranges freely among past, present, and (most significantly) the future. Dreams that seem to predict the future actually perceive it, not through any paranormal magic but because the “observer” that produces them, normally pegged to our conscious awareness, is free of it, free in sleep to see the future, which eludes us only because of the limitations of normal awareness. The observer that produces our dreams is only the second in a “series” of observers that might open up limitless temporal dimensions (running right up against the divine) and endless temporal freedom. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Dunne’s appeal to Priestley had everything to do with the purpose to which Priestley </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">325 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">felt this freedom might be put.

Throughout the nation Priestley discovers lost freedoms, social injustice, dehumanization, the “giant dirty trick” of the country’s industrial supremacy, everything becoming “too mechanised and Americanised,” “robot employment” and its corollary, “robot leisure,” but he also notes that “if there is not as much liberty here as I should like . . . there is a good deal more than there is in many countries just now.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">There is still hope for England, manifest in the folk in whom its spirit survives, and Priestley encourages it, calling for the nation to “waken up” and take active pride in everything that might sustain the “inner glowing tradition of the English spirit” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">MT</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 322). Most critical to this awakening, as we will see, was what Priestley found in Dunne’s vision of temporal freedom. For Priestley came to believe that England’s problems were essentially temporal ones, rooted in time’s mechanization, the dominance of present interests, and excessive divisions among past, present, and future.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Dunne promised solutions. As we will see, his serialism could enable new recourse to England’s great past and its promising future. It could liberate England from pres</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ent interests and confer upon its people new measures of temporal agency and even creativity. These alternatives were in turn essential to the politics Priestley would profess. He liked to say “it is little England I love,” and, as John Baxendale has noted, this little-Englandism was not simply reactionary nostalgia. It was not defined against outsiders, progress, or modernity, but against “Big Englanders,” those who want “to go and boss everybody about all over the world” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">MT</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 331). Pitched against Big-English single-mindedness, Priestley’s politics entailed something more heterodox, a radical populism embodied in the serial observers through whom Dunne theorized temporal freedom. Any inquiry into Priestley’s affinity for Dunne must take into account these political implications, which, I will argue, largely account for Priestley’s interest in bringing Dunne’s theory of time to the public stage. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Dreams come true—more than we tend to think, and for different reasons. Dunne begins </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">An Experiment with Time </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">with this claim and argues (from experience) that dreams actually can predict the future. Perplexed by such premonitions himself, Dunne had thought at first that he was “suffering, seemingly, from some extraordinary fault in my relation to reality, something so uniquely wrong that it compelled me to perceive, at rare intervals, large blocks of otherwise perfectly normal personal experience displaced from their proper positions in Time.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>10 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Far from uniquely wrong, these experiences came to seem “not abnormal, but </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">normal</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">,” leading him to believe “that dreams— dreams in general, all dreams, everybody’s dreams—were composed of images of past </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:; margin-right:17px; margin-left:64px; text-indent:-30px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">326 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">experience and images of future experience blended together in approximately equal proportions” (68). Such a blending also composes the universe. Only our “lop-sided” view of it, “with the ‘future’ part unaccountably missing, cut off from the growing ‘past’ by a traveling ‘present moment,’” makes it seem to exist only now. Because that view defines the primary way we “observe” the universe, consciousness is “lop-sided,” and only ceases to lop time away while we sleep. Dreaming therefore reveals the truth about time. The dreaming self observes things differently, and Dunne makes that form of observation the crux of his “experiment with time.” First there is waking consciousness or “observer 1,” fixated upon the present and cut off from real views of the past and the future. But next there is “observer 2,” nor</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">mally compelled by the nature of consciousness to observe what is seen by observer </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">1. </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">“But what if there is no focus of attention in field 1? What if field 1 becomes, as in deep sleep, a blank, owing to the passivity of the cerebellum?”: in that case, observer 2 becomes free to take a broader temporal view (194). No longer tied to the moving present observed in field 1, observer 2 yields visions of past and future, which not only characterize dreams but give us actual access to other moments in time. But it doesn’t end there, because observer 2 is watched as well, its visions and vantage point the basis for the temporal dimension of observer 3, and so on into infinity. An infinite regress gives way into any number of other temporalities, enabling possibilities and freedoms only denied us by the practical fixation of the “first” of them. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">For anyone “haunted” by time, Dunne held out intriguing hopes for everything from prophecy to total recall to immortality. More immediately, however, Priestley discovered some exciting dramatic possibilities. Undone by a bout of melancholy in 1937, Priestley was “blown away by the arrival, like a flash, of what seemed to me a glorious idea”: to make Dunne’s theory of time the basis for a new dramatic structure. “Suddenly I saw that there was a play in the relation between a fairly middle-class pro</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">vincial family and the theory of Time, the theory chiefly concerned with J. W. Dunne, over which I had been brooding for the past two years”: Priestley saw in a flash that “multiple time,” by which past, present, and future exist at once to understanding, freely observed by a non-practical awareness, could become the aesthetic form for the arrangement of scenes in a play.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>11 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">More specifically, the future could come before the present, its knowledge known to the audience, to give drama something like the power of comprehension Dunne attributes to temporal transcendence.

As the Conways try on costumes and cheerfully tease each other, only two things lend an air of gravity to the action. Performance is an issue, suggesting that the Conways may not be who they seem, and indicating Priestley’s interest in setting up nesting worlds of “observation.” More ominously, the siblings remember the death by drowning of their father, and Kay, who will become the play’s central intelligence, wonders if he might possibly have known in advance that he was to die: “Do you think </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">that sometimes, in a mysterious sort of way, he knew?”<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt"><Sup>13 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif">She asks if it is possible “to see </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'">327 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif">round the corner—into the future,” and the question becomes the play’s key proposal, as Kay dimly perceives a terrible future for the family. </SPAN></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">That terrible future then comes immediately into view. Act Two shifts directly to it. Act One takes place in 1919, at a moment of post-war uncertainty and excitement, with the young Conways all clamoring for progress, prosperity, and reform. Act Two takes place in the “present day” of 1937, and much has changed. The setting is the same, but “the general effect is harder and rather brighter,” an apt background for a family now ruined by financial failure, death, professional disappointment, betrayal, and hatred (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">TC</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 153). Amid the recriminations and bickering that characterize this portion of the play someone remembers the lost moment of happiness from the earlier scenes, “a long time ago, just after the War” when they “still thought we could suddenly make everything better for everybody. Socialism! Peace! Universal Brotherhood! All that” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">TC</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 173–174).

Alan’s version of Dunne proves redemptive.

The sister who will die declares with utter certainty that she is “going to </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">live</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">”; mother boasts she has refused a business deal which, we know from Act Two, could have been the family’s salvation (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">TC</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 195).

He responds, “There will be—something—I can tell you—one day. I’ll try—I promise,” and Priestley thereby moderates the horrors of the known future with the better possibilities of time as Dunne redefines it. Priestley’s immediate goal was to make “multiple time” the basis for the most “poi</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">gnant dramaturgy”—the best possible dramatization of the “tearing ironies” always most captivating to theater audiences.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>14 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">He pursued that goal in his many “time-plays,” including </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Dangerous Corner </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1932), </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">I Have Been Here Before </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1937), and </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Desert High</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">way </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1943). But this play’s emphatic moral lesson indicates that Priestley’s time-plays had another goal. Their dramatic structure advocates a redemptive form of temporal understanding. </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Time and the Conways </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">encourages us to think like Kay, to sharpen our vague sense of what is to come, and, in so doing, avert disaster and even realize a fuller form of life.

And dramatic effects therefore intervene in the very structure of time, not only representing that structure (our experience of it, the truth about it) but engineering a transformation through which the future might actually redeem the present moment.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>15 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">The intervention in question may indeed have become an ecological one, given the hit status of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Time and the Conways </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">as “by far the most important of the new plays of the season”—by one account, Priestley’s 1930s time-plays were also the “most </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">discussed </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">plays of the London season” (emphasis added)—and given Priestley’s wider efforts to publicize the link between his plays and Dunne’s theories.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>16 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">He had Dunne work with the original cast of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Time and the Conways </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(fig. 2), timed a new review of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">An Experi</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">ment with Time </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">to coincide with the play’s American production, noted himself that “one good result of the play’s success was that it turned the attention of many people towards J. W. Dunne and his Serialism,” and more generally promoted his play’s temporal relevance to the point where at least one contemporary characterized it as an effort to “popularize” temporal experimentation.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>17 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">As indicated in a headnote to his 1940 review of Dunne’s </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Nothing Dies</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, “Nothing has done more to familiarize the general public with what is commonly known as ‘the time problem’ than Mr. Priestley’s plays ‘Time and the Conways’ and ‘I Have Been Here Before,’ as well as passages in some of his recent books.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>18 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">And yet Priestley’s campaign in the theater of time went beyond Dunne, its full activity dependent upon the way Priestley marshaled other conceptual and political possibilities. To make the “experiment with time” actually transformative, Priestley rethought its relations both to art and to politics: he revised its system of “observers” to match them to “dramatic experience” and to link them to possibilities for new politi</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">cal freedom.

Priestley noted repeatedly that Dunne’s “observers,” each operating at a further remove from time as we know it, multiply into a bad infinite regress, endlessly defer</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ring temporal understanding.

He agreed that “observer 2” focuses on “observer 1” and achieves temporal freedom during that first observer’s blank moments. But whereas Dunne had argued that it took an “observer 3” to perceive that freedom, and, in turn, subsequent observers to achieve freedom’s fuller possibilities, Priestley established a different dynamic. He theorized a dialectic in which tension between the first two observers becomes the crucial object of understanding for the third. Observer 1 is fixed upon temporal action (in the present, in sequence); observer 2 is detached from action and free to contemplate past, present, and future together; and a dialectical relationship between these two temporalities—the practical time of observer 1, the contemplative freedom of observer 2—is the basis for real temporal empowerment at the level of observer 3.

In this reinvention of the terms of aesthetic theory, this variation on the dialectics that had long defined the aesthetic in terms of its synthesis of opposed modes of human understanding, Priestley readies Dunne’s temporality for entrance into the space of aesthetic engagement, and in turn, in the theater, the space of art’s redress. The aesthetic revision enabled him to correlate Dunne’s “observers” to aspects of the theater. In </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">The Art of the Dramatist</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, he suggests that “time three” is the tempo</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">rality of dramatic experience, setting up the theater as the space in which temporal freedom might uniquely obtain. The dramatist, Priestley argues, does not simply aim to reflect reality. What appears on stage always has a “double character,” “seen in the strange light and shadow of belief and disbelief,” belonging to “a heightened reality that we know to be unreal” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">AD</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 5). Reality combines with the unreal (fantasy, proph</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ecy, the symbolic) to generate dramatic experience. But the audience must contribute to dramatic experience “by allowing our minds to function on two levels at the same time,” the levels of empirical judgment and imaginative disbelief. As we function on both levels, “when these two are delicately balanced and both are excitedly meet</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ing the demands made upon them,” then we achieve an “ecstatic state” of aesthetic awareness. This state is a mode of “exhilarating” aesthetic awareness to be had only in the theater; “the Theater exists to provide it for us,” for “the simultaneous double response . . . makes this experience unlike any other” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">AD</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 10, 39).

But this disclaimer was in fact simply Priestley’s way to express the hope for a more fundamental way to make temporal freedom publicly available through dramatic experience.

They suggest “a vision of man in relation to the whole stream of time” in something like the way “multiple time” could envision all times at once; they “build a vision of man secure in the longer view of history, in his present control of time, and in his creative control of the future,” much the way Priestley’s time-plays model forms of human agency defined by the simultaneity of past, present, and future understanding. At their best, they dramatize a way for modern man to “[see] himself creating history out of his vision of the past and his will for the future,” engineering just the capacities Priestley would promote through dramatic experience.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>23 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Tennessee Williams, most of all.

In his well-known essay “The Timeless World of a Play” (1951), Williams regrets the way the “continual rush of time . . . deprives our actual lives of so much dignity and meaning,” and contrasts the “depth and significance” conferred upon the world of the theater by its “arrest of time.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>25 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Theater exists to afford an opportunity for timeless contemplation, a chance, for example, to look with extended solicitude upon Willy Loman, someone likely to be quickly dismissed by us in real life. And a play’s moments of recognition last as such. “By a sort of legerdemain, events are made to remain </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">events</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, rather than being reduced so quickly to mere </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">occurrences</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">”: this distinction corresponds to the contrasting tem</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">poralities through which Priestley engineers a chance for real temporal change. For Williams, however, no such result is likely. When the play ends, time reasserts itself; “by the time we have arrived at Sardi’s,” we return to a real life that cannot accommo</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">date human dignity and higher meaning.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>26 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Audiences can only temporarily gain access to something better, without much hope of recognizing any potentially redemptive relationship between the time of the world and the time of the theater. Priestley, by contrast, tries for something longer lasting, a timeless world enabled by the example of dramatic experience. His sense of this possibility was also shared by contemporary dramatic theorists, most notably Susanne Langer, whose </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Feeling and Form </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1953) similarly correlates dramatic experience to broadened temporal recourse. Langer defines drama as “form in suspense”; it is the aesthetic mode of “destiny.” Whereas other dramatic theories posit that theater exists to create a perpetual present, Langer notes that “it is only a present filled with its own future that is really dramatic.” In dramatic action, the future is implicit, because the present moment is performed always implying the existence of what is to come. The sense of destiny “makes the present action seem like an integral part of the future, howbeit that future has not unfolded yet,” and the “total action” of drama is not just action in the present but action undertaken always with an implication of outcomes.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>27 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Not unlike “multiple time,” this theory of the temporality of dramatic experience is what Priestley makes explicit, in plays that literalize destiny’s implication in the present moment. He makes the “feeling” Langer theorizes a reflexive object of dramatic attention. Langer would not have argued that drama’s mode of destiny could transfer into a function of human awareness, but practical understanding was in fact a key concern of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Feeling and Form</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">: pragmatism motivated Langer to bracket philosophical sources and ground her work in impulses of studio practice. She shared Priestley’s sense that dramatic experience was not special to an isolated aesthetic realm but a product and source of real know-how. That sense was shared as well by Jackson Barry. Barry’s </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Dramatic Structure: the Shaping of Experience </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1970), also roughly contemporary with Priestley’s explanation of the time-schemes implicit in dramatic experience, claims that drama offers a purchase upon a fundamental tension between two forms of time: “drama is an image of man’s life in time in which the pattern structures represent our view of time as fixed—as capable of being viewed as </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">pattern</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">—whereas the improvisational quality corresponds to our sense of time as the eternally changing, eternally present ‘becoming.’”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>28 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In his </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">time-plays, Priestley makes a similar duality the basis for dramatic experience but also, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">333 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">in turn, a focus for transformative “observation,” making what is implicit in Barry’s theory of the dramatic “shaping of experience” an actual activity in audience response. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">A play like </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Time and the Conways</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, then, was poised to do more than present Dunne’s theories or make them the basis for a compelling dramatic structure.

Any play would do so, given Priestley’s definition of dramatic experience, but these plays provoke their audience to enact the freedom they embody, thematizing their structure in such a way as to make it an explicit and active achievement. That theater as an institution might play such a role—actively enhancing real lives—was always Priestley’s hope, one articulated in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">The Arts Under Socialism </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1947), </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Theatre Outlook </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1947), and other texts that align aesthetic engagement with progressive social ambition. It was a hope perhaps best expressed in his celebration of the way England’s regional theaters “have opened little windows into a world of ideas . . . have kept going a stir of thought and imagination . . . have acted as outposts of for the army of the citizens of tomorrow, demanding to live . . . a life at once more ardent and imaginative and more thoughtful than their fathers and mothers ever knew.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>29 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">But it was in terms of time that Priestley tried to lead this audience-army—in terms of the temporality of dramatic experience that could in turn redeem the life of their forebears.

Populist rhetoric makes time theory into political theory, suggesting that the temporal freedom found in Dunne justifies Priestley’s little-English egalitarianism. This rhetoric becomes more explicit, too, developing beyond rhetoric into explicit connections between temporal freedom and democracy itself. In a remark</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">able passage written in the late 1930s, Priestley blames “the idea of inexorable passing time” for the rise of fascism: </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:34px; margin-left:32px; line-height:16px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F">When masses of men, feeling anything but positive, come to believe that life is a meaning<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt"></SPAN>less accident, that they are homeless among the cold black spaces, that they are huddled together in an execution chamber, that their humanity is without sense and dignity, then they are soon trapped within a vicious circle.

Without a sense of human dignity, people lose claim to their rights and become “men in the mass,” subject to those who would take power over them. Thus, fascism: “much of the evil of our age comes from the notion that we have merely so much time before oblivion overtakes us,” and Priestley explicitly attributes both this notion and that evil to “Nazi leaders” and their cult of death, making an association prevalent throughout the critique of fascism.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>31 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">So when Priestley speaks of his reasons for wanting to popularize Dunne’s theories in terms of a wish to “liberate” the public from the “bad idea” of time “still dominating our age,” he has extended Dunne from theoretical interest to pressing political practice, for the liberation in question is inseparable from that which would deliver mankind from real political subjugation (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">MT</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 282). </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Priestley makes the connection between conventional temporality and contemporary politics clear again in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Out of the People</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, the book he wrote for the Authors National Committee in 1940: “It is this all-too-common belief that events are now out of our control that gives enormous power to ambitious and wicked men who know this fool</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ish view is wrong and proceed to shape events.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>32 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">As much as he was alarmed about the content of the events in question, Priestley was more concerned with the form of time that put events beyond the control of the English people.

Priestley’s goal is to restore it, believing that this restoration really might only require the kind of public interventions his own projects could accomplish. For the Great Time “is here with us, if we do not delib</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">erately blind ourselves to it, and is ready to give us courage and strength” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">MT</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 141). Courage and strength could in turn mean England’s redemption. If English democracy is in a poor state largely because the time-frame necessary to sustain it has been lost, restoring the Great Time could mean giving the nation the strength to reassert its great popular identity. Not a great imperial one—Priestley’s England is never more than a home for its folk—but one great for its transcendence of immediate interests into the wider scheme of eternal concerns. Such an outcome is nowhere inherent in Dunne’s Serialism, but Priestley’s version of it adds the sociopolitical associations necessary to dramatize a very pressing need to experiment with time. Politicizing Dunne, Priestley makes his theory of time the basis for public action. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">There is an allegorical figure for Priestley’s ideal England that reflects the way “multiple time” would redeem it. Priestley once argued that the unicorn ought to be England’s heraldic symbol. In “The Unicorn,” he claims that “we are losing because we are backing the wrong beast”: not the lion but the unicorn should be the symbol of England, in part because it “escapes the withering process of time,” in part because of its association with little-English enchantment, but also because of the way it fig</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ures Priestley’s hybrid of timelessness, freedom, and Englishness: “I am seeing it, of course, as the heraldic sign and symbol of the imaginative, creative, boldly inventive, original, and individual side of the national character.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>35 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">The unicorn stands for the national character as Priestley’s temporal campaign would have it: Englishness made quirky and free, creative and impractical. Just as the unicorn differs from the lion for its loopy, pacifist sentimentality, trading imperial vigor for magical unrealism, Priestley would engineer a utopianism different from that which tends to motivate fantasies of national coherence. Another good image for it appears in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">An English Journey</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, in a contrast between what one might expect from Priestley and the utopianism the book really favors. One illustration envisions the Cotswolds as an object of fairly predictable sentimental nostalgia, “the most English and the least spoiled of all our countrysides” (fig. 3). But another envisions Lincoln as something more peculiar. Observing that there “you labour down below, in the clanging twentieth century, and spend your leisure by the side of the Cathedral, in the twelfth century,” Priestley associates Englishness with a certain power of temporal liberty, the power to put together the nation’s best moments into a composite identity (fig. 4).</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>36 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">It is worth pausing over this utopianism to distinguish it from that common to Priest</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ley’s contemporaries, or, rather, to note how the utopianism he shared with them entails </SPAN></P><IMG width=496 height=347 style="display:block; float:none; text-align:left; margin-bottom:4px" src="images/19.2.matz_img_4.jpg"><P style="text-align:justify"><SPAN style="font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F">▲ </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:16px; margin-right:4px; line-height:17px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:8pt; color:#221E1F">Figs. 3 &amp; 4.the standard little-Englandism of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:8pt; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">English Journey</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:8pt; color:#221E1F"> vs. the different framework enabled by “multiple time” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:8pt; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">English Journey</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:8pt; color:#221E1F"> 40, 292). </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">a form of understanding more radically experimental than which shapes the utopias of William Morris and H.

Although Woolf, Proust, and others would seem to have little in common with Priestley’s jolly wish to ride the uni<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif"></SPAN>corn into a better English future, their versions of the relationship between aesthetic engagement and public time share Priestley’s sense that the former might redeem the latter. Their texts hold out the same hope made so explicit in Priestley’s public campaign </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif">to encourage England to pursue the unconventional time-frames of its dreams and his </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'">337 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif">plays.

Proust represents the art of memory, but also encourages his readers to make use of his book, “my book being merely a sort of magnifying glass like those which the optician at Combray used to offer his customers—it would be my book, but with its help I would furnish them with the means of reading what may lie inside themselves.”<SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt"><Sup>40 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif">Woolf shows how to keep time from passing with a view toward multiple time not unlike that which Priestley stages in the theater, despite the way </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic">To the Lighthouse </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif">apparently represents subjective time for psychological insight alone. Even if Woolf’s novel would seem to conclude with the wholly private experience of art hidden away in attics, she models the format through which aesthetic experience yields forms of temporal agency. Other modernist temporalities likewise present themselves as meta-utopian public opportunities, forms in which art might enable people to reclaim time. </SPAN></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:16px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">This difference between modernism’s well-known representations of temporal complexity and these pragmatic performances of temporal redress may seem minor, but it makes a major difference to our understanding of the nature and purpose of the representation of time in modernist art. Especially in the context of Priestley’s public-intellectual pursuits, time ecology redefines aesthetic engagement. Representations that have seemed to pursue regretful mimesis of ironic failure or escape from public time into worlds of private transcendence now pursue an active public mission. The divide between aesthetic experience and public life so durably definitive of modernist culture not only disappears but becomes an active dialectic, or, more than that, itself an object of redemptive play. And the divide between aesthetic form and instrumental action—so vexing to theorists throughout the history of the aesthetic, and particularly a problem for political theorists wanting to find a central place for art without destroy</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ing its status as such—similarly disappears. The instrumentality in question, the use of aesthetic form to redeem public time, is one that would bring the object of its action back around toward the ideal. In other words, putting art into practice here does not entail any undoing of art’s definitive nonpracticality but instead modifies praxis such that it more closely resembles aesthetic engagement. For if time becomes a field of freedom, it makes gains in the structure definitive of art, that free play of impressions that has for so long distinguished aesthetic experience from forms of ideality on the one hand and action on the other. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">The Priestley play most dedicated to the politics of temporal redemption, and the one that has had most success advancing his temporal campaign, is </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">An Inspector Calls </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1946).

As the play’s first two acts progress, each member of the family turns out to be responsible for the suicide: the father had fired her (after she led a group threatening a labor strike); the daughter had been responsible for the loss of another job (at a shop, where the daughter felt she’d been treated with insolence); the mother had turned the girl away when she came in search of charitable help, and the son had been responsible for the pregnancy that finally drove the girl to suicide. It’s an absurd set of coincidences—how could each of them have destroyed the same girl?—and the play’s first clever surprise is that they actually did not. Inspector Goole is no inspector at all, and he has only threaded together disparate circumstances into this single drama, fooling the family into thinking the many young women they’d wronged in one way or another were a single suicide when in fact there has been no suicide at all. Or so it seems, until the plays final and famous surprise ending, in which an Inspector really does call—about a suicide that has only just occurred. </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">An Inspector Calls </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">is good, serviceable, boiler-plate drama, the basis of any number of imitations and parodies since its first production in 1946.

I do not mean to revalue Priestley as much as to make him represent a certain approach to the relationship between aesthetic engagement and temporal modernity. Priestley was a leading figure in this effort to make of art a new purchase on time and, in turn, to rectify a range of social and cultural practices necessarily structured according to temporal custom. As such, he can help us to understand that effort—to see how it characterizes the arts of the twentieth century and how it still (or perhaps even increasingly) motivates a certain form of aesthetic innovation. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Perhaps the best way to make this last argument is to discover Priestley’s campaign in a twenty-first-century work that would hardly seem to have anything to do with anything Priestley represents.

That scene gives way to prior ones: the woman and the two men consorting happily at a party, until she takes offense at something and leaves on her own; earlier, single long shots of the woman and her lover in intimate states of loving joy; and then, the clincher: the scene in which the woman discovers she is pregnant. So first, a violent murder, which turns out to be a scene of vengeance, following upon a rape, which in turn follows scenes of bliss and promise. The film ends here: disclosing that the woman is pregnant, and then, finally, showing the woman as a girl in a park, at peace amid a swirl of life rolling merrily along. The point of showing things in reverse is to cultivate a dramatic irony as brutal as the film’s notorious rape scene. Unless there is another point, one indicated by something else we see in the film’s final scene: as the progress of life spins around her, the girl whose life will one day be so brutally destroyed holds——but fails to read—</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">An Experiment with Time </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(fig. 5). The book is here to suggest that what is so horribly irreversible in her life could be reversed were Dunne heeded, just as it is reversed in the visual language of film.
