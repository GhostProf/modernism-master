Introduction

</h3>

<p>
Archaeology, as an academic discipline and as a means of addressing
the past, is a phenomenon that emerged in the modern era. For many
commentators this is because some specific aspect of the modern experience
has facilitated or promoted the study of the material traces of the
past. These might include the rise of an educated and affluent middle
class; improvements in transport, which rendered the antiquities of the
countryside accessible; or the construction of canals and railways, and
the consequent exposure of buried deposits. However, in this contribution
I will argue that the link between archaeology and modernity is more than
circumstantial. Indeed, I will suggest that modern philosophy, modern
forms of political organization, and modern social practices represent
the ground of the possibility of "doing archaeology." I will hope to
demonstrate that in some senses archaeology distills a modern sensibility,
embodying conceptions of time, humanity, nature, and science that have
been widely adopted over the past half-millennium. It is distinctive
of the modern world that philosophy and science, while representing
the discourses of specialized professionals, have contributed much to
the everyday rationality routinely employed by lay people. This is in
part because philosophy and science partake of a "ground plan" or set
of fundamental assumptions that is hard to fully articulate, and is
therefore metaphysical.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Archaeology, perhaps as much as any other discipline, is steeped in
the implicit and explicit presuppositions of modern thought.
<p>
This argument presents us with a series of paradoxes. The project of
archaeology, which uses material evidence to investigate


<b></b>


both prehistory and the historic past, is distinctively modern, and is
often understood to involve a kind of conversation between different
cultural or temporal horizons. Yet the very conditions that predispose
us to work in this way, and encourage us to believe that a knowledge
of the past is valuable, make it more difficult for us to comprehend
that past. For the burden of my case is that the worlds that we address
through archaeology are often ones in which archaeology would itself
be inconceivable. One of the most distinctive characteristics of
modernity has been the decline of tradition, and the corresponding
growth of "mechanical" forms of social integration, such as state
institutions. While traditional communities often have a knowledge of
the past which is transmitted orally between the generations, and which
is integral to social relations as a consequence, modern institutions
require legitimation by reference to an empirically validated past.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
This relation of exteriority to the past was one of the critical elements
in the creation of archaeology. Equally important was the recognition
that the past was different from the present in significant ways. It
has often been pointed out that modern societies are <i>futural,</i>
and that philosophical ideas take on the role of legislating and planning
for the future in modernity.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The search for perfection in the future is pursued through the design
of objects and institutions, and through establishing new foundations
for thought and action.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Such a directional, nonreversible view of history implies a past in
which contemporary technologies and social arrangements were less
strongly developed.
<p>
Conventional histories of archaeology often point to activities that
prere the practice of excavation: Nabonidus's diggings in the
temple of Larsa, classical Greek openings of earlier tombs, or Bishops
Earldred and Eadmar's recovery of building stone from St. Albans in the
eleventh century <small>A.D.</small> But it is important to distinguish
between <i>addressing the archaeological,</i> in the sense of recovering
ancient artifacts for use as treasure or raw materials, and <i>practicing
archaeology</i>. The latter requires the understanding that these objects
can be studied in such a way as to generate new knowledge about people who
are no longer present, and the development of an appropriate inferential
framework. The need for this kind of knowledge was minimal during the
Middle Ages in the West, where the dominant view of history was linear,
yet extended between the Creation and the Judgment. The belief that the
last days were at hand was widespread, and the Bible's authoritative view
of the past was that it was to be measured in a few generations, and
had not differed from the present in social or technological terms. By
contrast, Renaissance scholars were more likely to argue that human
beings were able to change their own conditions of existence by action,
thereby bringing about historical change.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Yet this emphasis on human action was held in check by the powerful
influence of teleology, and the attendant notion of the world as a
kind of integrated body or organism. Michel Foucault has described the
holistic conception of knowledge that prevailed within this cosmology:
all things contained meaning and moral value, and all were networked
together by connotation, sympathy, reflection and metaphor.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
All phenomena gravitated to their appropriate place in the world
according to their moral worth, and the imbricated totality was
continually in motion as each entity progressed toward its immaterial
ideal form. Where this tendency toward


<b></b>


the telos was conceived as the principal cause of change in the universe,
human acts were understood as "efficient causes," and were thus thought
relatively inconsequential.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
Nonetheless, the Renaissance enthusiasm for the classical world had
inspired an appreciation of the difference of the past. This chimed with
the humanist recognition of human diversity, even if historical change was
often understood in terms of a continuous decline of human faculties since
ancient times. The new attention paid to the classical past gave rise to
the practices of antiquarianism, specifically the collection of ancient
artifacts, and also to Marsilio Ficino's rediscovery of Plato. The latter
would revive a mathematical conception of the world, in time providing a
challenge to the dominant influence of Aristotelianism. Teleology was
also to be confronted by a growing emphasis on individuality during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In their quite different ways,
Erasmus would stress free rational action and creativity, while Luther
developed a vision of the subject as wholly responsible before God for
his or her own salvation.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Yet both were to contribute to an intellectual climate in which
personal action was placed above traditional authority and dogma. The
consequence would be the Council of Trent, with its restatement of
papal infallibility and the unquestionable character of the Church's
teachings. Stephen Toulmin has elegantly demonstrated that it was the
political, philosophical, and religious strife and instability of the
later seventeenth and earlier eighteenth centuries that gave rise to a
new desire for stability, truth, and certainty, which was manifested
in rationalist philosophy and its confluence with empiricism in the
Scientific Revolution.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the challenge to
monarchic rule seen in the English Civil War, brought about a reaction
against humanist skepticism and pluralism. But from the point of view of
the argument being developed here the eventual creation of archaeology
depended equally upon the acknowledgement of the importance of human
agency and its products (artifacts, architecture and institutions), and
the attitudes to evidence and materiality that were to be established
in the Scientific Revolution. The specificity of archaeology is such
that it was not a product of a single intellectual tradition, but of
the contingent relations between what were in some cases opposed ways
of thinking.

<h3>

Order and epistemology
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
From the seventeenth century onward, scholarship was increasingly
connected with the state, while religion was to some extent compromised
by its identification as a source of fraternal strife. Learning had a
growing role in the construction and maintenance of political authority,
and this was particularly the case with history and antiquarianism. Where
rulers like Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden sought to create bureaucratic
and managerial monarchies, rather than rely upon divine right and
dynastic inheritance, they began to provide patronage for antiquaries
such as Johan Bure. Bure's investigations of early medieval rune-stones
effectively documented the early history of the Swedes, providing a
grounding identity for the new nation-state.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
This imperative to create historical foundations for the modern state
can be compared to the contemporary drive to establish a secure ground
for knowledge. The two separate strands


<b></b>


that were to contribute to this project, Baconian empiricism and
Cartesian rationalism, shared a wish to reconstruct science from
first principles. In the case of Francis Bacon, it was to be the
immediate sensory experience of things that would provide a starting
place. Innumerable experiments and observations should be catalogued
to form a universal natural history, which would in time give humanity
dominion over nature.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
This argument overturned the Renaissance belief that since humanity
was in decline, all worthwhile knowledge existed in the writings of
the ancient authors.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
By insisting that new knowledge, not contained in any book, could be
created through the experience of material things, Bacon was putting
in place one of the prerequisite elements of any archaeology. At the
same time, Bacon's view that the incremental growth of human knowing
was the means to progress was, once refined by Hobbes and Locke, to
contribute to a historical narrative of social and technical evolution
through the application of reason.
<p>
Ren&#x000E9; Descartes's approach to refounding knowledge was to
concentrate on pure, abstract reason, while doubting everything
else. Descartes held reasoning to be an innate capacity, given to
humanity by God, and therefore more reliable than the sense-evidence
focused on by Bacon. Where Renaissance scholars had explored connections
and resemblances, Descartes mistrusted appearances and sought to reduce
reality to its elemental forms in mathematics and geometry. This demanded
measurement and comparison, and the division of any complex entity into
its component parts in order to render it comprehensible. Ironically,
Descartes's means of rescuing human knowledge from skepticism was by
way of skepticism itself, cutting away any supposition that could not be
proven until he arrived at the rock-solid certainty that if a person is
aware of her own thinking, her real existence is guaranteed. One cannot be
tricked or deluded into thinking that one is thinking. Descartes takes
consciousness as his foundation, and works outward to reestablish a
method for investigating the world. This had a number of implications:
conscious reason was understood as being the essence of humanity;
epistemology gained priority over all other forms of knowing; whatever
could be known was to be known by a human subject.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Christianity had put in place a cosmology in which human beings were
possessed of immortal souls, and inhabited a transient world that
would be replaced by the coming of the kingdom of heaven. In contrast
with the ancient Greek conception of mortals in an eternal world,
this had established the view that creation was at the disposal of
humankind. Descartes's philosophy built on this perspective by presenting
humans as privileged interpreters of reality. Humanity now found itself
at the center of a world to which it gave a structure. This view would
be elaborated by Hobbes and Locke, who saw the universe as composed
only of particular things, while order was imposed on it by human reason.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
While Renaissance thinkers had seen themselves as exploring the
resemblances and associations that permeated creation, from this time
onward the role of the scholar was one of classification and ordering.
<p>
From the point of view of archaeology, Descartes's influence was most
profound in the role that he afforded to epistemology. Once one has
argued that verifiable knowledge rests upon the subject's self-certainty
and free will, while the material world


<b></b>


behaves according to invariant laws, the most fundamental problem of
philosophy is that of how the mind can apprehend physical things.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
In this way of thinking the goal of any investigation is the
representation of phenomena in the mind, and the purpose of epistemology
is to make sure that reconstruction is achieved without the distortions
wrought by prejudice and superstition. By implication, a coherent and
uniform method has priority over any specific question that we might
wish to ask concerning worldly phenomena: any particular understanding is
secondary to the problem of the possibility of knowledge in general. This
has meant, firstly, that the apprehension of the world through perception
has been identified as a difficulty, and secondly that the positioning
of a generalized methodology before any specific engagement with material
things has become a virtually unquestionable assumption.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
This privileging of epistemology values a universalized and
decontextualized logic over the particular or the contingent. It also
construes knowing as a procedure, which can be conducted in a right or a
wrong way, and which produces meaning out of things that are themselves
without meaning.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
The position of epistemology as first philosophy is virtually constitutive
of archaeology. The typological classification of artifacts and
their chronological ordering through seriation, the construction of
regional chronologies and stylistic sequences, the plotting of spatial
distributions and the definition of "culture groups" all depend upon
the view that an abstract method should be applied to entities before
they are rendered meaningful. Indeed, following Descartes, these are all
methodological procedures that fragment a relational world into discrete
objects in order to render it malleable. In the "culture-historic"
archaeology that dominated the discipline in both Europe and the Americas
throughout the first half of the twentieth century the rigorous definition
of traits, phases, components, and culture-groups on the basis of the
stylistic variation of material culture was understood as a purely
descriptive exercise.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
This methodical enterprise was nonetheless presumed to give the
archaeologist access to real sociocultural entities that had existed in
the past. Assemblages of pots could be equated with past "peoples." The
assumption here was that human beings always divide themselves into
bounded communities identifiable through mutually exclusive artifactual
repertoires. When culture-history came under attack from a generation
of more anthropologically oriented archaeologists in the United States
during the 1940s, it was on the grounds that archaeology needed greater
epistemological refinement. Revealingly, Walter Taylor was to argue that
archaeology is not exclusively related to either history or anthropology.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Rather, archaeology is simply a methodology which can be used in the
service of either discipline. By implication, archaeology is a technology
for the extraction of data, which can be absolutely distinguished from
the attribution of meaning that might be performed at a later stage by
anthropologists or historians.
<p>
Taylor's call for archaeologists to refound their discipline by returning
to epistemological first principles is characteristic of modern thought,
carrying echoes of both Locke's wish to clear the ground for new
understandings and the early pronouncements of logical positivism. The
same imperative was restated by the "New Archaeology" of the 1960s,
which set out to create a new foundation for the discipline, separating


<b></b>


the discovery of archaeological remains from their evaluation, and in
the process removing subjectivity from archaeological reasoning.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Far the most profound thinker in this school, Lewis Binford has spent
much of his career constructing ways of assessing the significance
of statements about the past. While early practitioners of the New
Archaeology attempted to apply the hypothetico-deductive method to
their arguments, Binford was to point out that hypotheses about the
past could not be tested on material evidence in the present.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
The past is not available for testing. Binford's eventual answer to
the problem lay in "middle range theory," which sought to typify the
signatures of mechanical and physical processes observable in the
archaeological record on the basis of observations and experiments
in the present. He described this process as one of giving meaning
to archaeological observations, the implication of which is that
archaeological evidence in the present is simply dead, meaningless
matter.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Moreover, this approach construes events (the butchering of an animal;
the breaking of a pot) in an atomized way, as context-free happenings
that bring about discrete material outcomes.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Crucially, both the New Archaeology of the 1960s and Binford's more
recent work follow the Cartesian formula of constructing methods in
abstraction, while understanding that meaning only arrives on the scene
when the analysis is complete.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Artifacts, atomism, and the social contract
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Bacon's argument that new knowledge could be created from things
was to have a critical significance for the way that artifacts were
understood, including those deriving from the distant past. If objects
were the equivalent of books that could be studied, rather than
simply representing illustrative examples of phenomena, collections
of things might be compared to libraries. This is the conception that
lies behind the modern museum. In this sense the museum was a product
of the seventeenth century, but histories of archaeology have tended to
underestimate the importance of the Renaissance "cabinets of curiosity"
that predated museums. While the significance of personal collections
that occasionally contained antiquities is acknowledged, cabinets are
sometimes dismissed as haphazard and disordered. In particular, they
generally failed to discriminate between cultural artifacts and "natural"
geological and biological samples. This neglects the point that cabinets
were often structured according to an Aristotelian system of knowledge,
in which entities were connected by sympathy, allegory, correspondence,
and reflection rather than typology and tabulation.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Cabinets of curiosity represented a microcosm of the world at large,
and in some cases were even understood as an apparatus for the practice
of a form of sympathetic magic. The emergence of museums thus amounts
to a transformation of the cultural practice of collecting, but was
also a symptom of a shift to a modern mode of knowing, which changed
the status of artifacts. This change was crucial for the development
of archaeology in its contemporary form.
<p>
If the cabinet was an array of objects that one could manipulate from
within, the museum was a world-picture, whose order could be appreciated
from without. Museums were increasingly organized according to what
Foucault describes as the table or


<b></b>


grid, the dominant re of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
knowledge.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Taxonomic classification emerged as a means by which the order of
nature could be made apparent: an imposition of human reason upon
nature, which nonetheless betrayed the first glimmer of a suspicion
that there might be underlying structures beneath the visible surface
of reality. Significantly, Edward Lhwyd, one of the early keepers of the
Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, developed a typological ordering of fossils,
which he later applied to antiquities.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Once the classificatory table had replaced a holistic vision of nature,
it was more than likely that a typology of artifacts would develop,
as the work of Caylus and Winckelmann was to demonstrate.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
If museums provided the context for the identification of ancient
artifacts as nodes within a classificatory grid, seventeenth-century
thought inclined more generally to the view that objects were
free-standing entities which logically preceded any structure in which
they were implicated. This facilitated a mechanical conception of the
universe such as that of Newton, in which a single set of laws applied
to all phenomena throughout the cosmos.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
This mechanism insisted that material things cannot move themselves:
there is no tendency toward a telos and only external causality. The
isolation of material things as autonomous entities fits closely with the
removal of meaning from the physical world. Things are not inherently
meaningful, and meaning is created in the mind. The valorization of a
knowledge that was decontextualized and universal can be seen as part
of the project of severing it from religion, politics, and ethics.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
The supposed universality of the ideas of the new science and the new
philosophy indicated that the same kinds of regularities that had been
identified in nature might also be found in human societies.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
As a consequence, arguments about the human past that can present
themselves as scientific and value-free have been able to claim a degree
of legitimacy, while those that address questions of ethics, legality
or aesthetics have been placed on a par with rhetoric, superstition and
fantasy. These arguments continue to be rehearsed today, with claims for
the absolute separation of science from other forms of archaeological
knowledge.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
The first manifestation of a Newtonian conception of human relations is
found in the "social physics" of Hobbes and Locke. Here, the singular
human being is envisaged as the social atom, who is a fully formed agent
before his insertion into the social field. This means that society is a
kind of contract, an artificial arrangement constructed by human beings,
and it follows that it can be redesigned for the better. This is what we
would now describe as "social engineering." While the notion of a "social
contract" is one that goes back to classical times, its articulation
by Hobbes in <i>Leviathan</i> , and the quite different version
presented by Rousseau , have been singularly influential in the
development of modern political ideas.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
Most importantly, the growth of the nation-state as the characteristic
political formation of modernity has involved a change from sovereign
rule to government as a management of populations that has required a
degree of consent.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
The designed and managed state has both drawn on and contributed to
the philosophy of social contract, and has generated the widespread
expectation that national identities, bounded territories, a
shared language or culture, and state organization, should all be
congruent. That is to say, the belief in a





sutured and internally homogeneous ethnic or political community, which
can be retrospectively imposed on the past, is in part a product of
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century political philosophies. We have
seen that the existence of such units in the distant past has been
a fundamental assumption of particular forms of archaeology. Equally
important, though, has been the way in which these ideas concerning the
"naturalness" of bounded "peoples," and the belief in their existence
in a golden age in the past, contributed to the creation of popular
nationalism at the start of the nineteenth century.
<p>
We have already seen that once the monarchs of Europe began to cast
themselves as the chief executive of the nation-state they could no
longer rely on their dynastic inheritance for legitimacy, and turned
instead to the historical authenticity of the political community. The
role of the early antiquarians in substantiating the early histories of
the European nations was not a precocious nationalism, but scholarship in
the service of the state. By contrast, the archaeology of the nineteenth
century drew upon and was promoted by the notion of a "national past,"
which occasionally played against the interests of the ruling classes by
demanding the preservation of ancient monuments and relics. Nationalism
essentializes the past, seeking an origin for the present in a
prelapsarian state of pristine ethnic uniformity. Nationalism generally
presents itself as being hostile to new-fangled, cosmopolitan, hybrid,
miscegenatory modernity. It celebrates tradition and the wholesome
peasant existence of the imagined past, and yet it is a profoundly
modern phenomenon.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Archaeology has supported this agenda by helping to construct idealized
pasts. However, while some authorities have presented nationalism
as a layer of distortion that has been imposed onto the evidence by
practitioners with an atavistic bias,
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
this view represents a retreat into a belief that "the truth about the
past" can be readily separated from interests and prejudices. Even at a
methodological level, archaeology is permeated by modernist assumptions
regarding the character of the past, as we have seen in the case of
culture-history.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
It is worth pointing out that the "processual," ecological, functionalist
archaeologies of the 1960s and 1970s were equally attached to the
notion of "societies" or "communities" as naturally occurring human
units, which existed in an adaptive and homeostatic relationship with
their environments. This conception is equally indebted to the social
philosophies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Reason, progress, and metanarratives
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
That the Newtonian framework could be generalized to cover human
society was axiomatic for the Enlightenment, which built on Locke's
belief that knowledge is acquired and Descartes's emphasis on free will
and the exercise of reason to claim that humans can transform their own
conditions of existence and achieve worldly perfection. The acquisition
of greater understanding is thereby a route toward social progress. For
Enlightenment philosophers like Voltaire, reason was universal, and all
human beings were equally capable of perfecting their rational conduct,
providing that the shackles of tradition, authority and superstition
can be cast aside. Yet the implication


<b></b>


of this argument is that there is a single universal condition and
type of society that all human beings should aspire to, that human
diversity is superficial, and that Western civilization is superior to
any traditional society. This amounts to a denial of human finitude,
the condition of being positioned in contingent circumstances as the
mortal inheritor of a particular cultural tradition. Many would insist
that this is actually the source of our humanity.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Given the diversity of humankind in the present and the possibility
of perfection in the future, Enlightenment thinkers proposed a series
of conjectural historical sequences by which humanity might be in
the process of progressing from savagery to civilization. In most
cases these replaced the Christian narrative of the fall from grace
followed by salvation with a story of the progressive freeing of the
human individual from the state of nature.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
These philosophical histories were often stadial in character, composed
of progressive phases of savagery, barbarism and civilization, or hunting,
pastoralism, agriculture, and commerce.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
Implicitly or explicitly, such schemes suggested the progressive
evolution of technology over time.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
These arguments were constructed entirely in isolation from any material
evidence, but they nonetheless provided the inspiration for Christian
Thomsen's organization of the material in the collection of the Royal
Commission of Danish Ancient Monuments in Copenhagen into finds from
the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. This was the first use of the
"three age system" in archaeology.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
A less obvious way in which Enlightenment conceptions of history have
been critical to archaeology has been in the distinction between history
and nature. While historical change was directional, nature was, until
the beginning of the nineteenth century, generally considered to be
inert. Consequentially, human progress depended upon an escape from the
state of nature at some time in the past, resulting in a preoccupation
with origins. This still casts a shadow over archaeology, where "the
origins of anatomically modern humans," "the origins of the human mind,"
and "the origins of agriculture" remain topics of debate.
<p>
The fixity of nature began to come into question in the later eighteenth
century, when biologists like Buffon started to argue that the physiology
of animal species can change over time. Foucault has pointed to the
particularly important role that Cuvier played in replacing the view
that creatures were place-holders within a massive classificatory table
with an emphasis on the functional character of anatomy and the behavior
of animals.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
This introduced a discontinuity into nature, while indicating that there
were important aspects of the character of creatures which could not be
ascertained from their surface morphology. After Cuvier it was easier
for the notion of biological evolution to develop, and with it a dynamic
conception of nature. A natural world that was constantly in motion
threatened to displace the division between culture and nature, but the
conceptual danger was overcome by distinguishing between "processual"
change (which might be cyclical) and historical change (which remained
directional and irreversible). Within archaeology this has led to some
confusion over the particular kind of change that characterizes specific
phenomena in the past. For instance, does the development from hunting
and gathering to herding and cultivation constitute a "natural" or a
"historical" process? In practice, different generations of





archaeologists have argued for either option at different
times. Occasionally, archaeologists have sought to collapse history into
nature, effectively echoing the materialism of Gassendi and La Mettrie.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
A spectacular example of this is found in the "palaeoeconomy" school
of the 1960s, which argued that all prehistoric developments could be
understood using the conceptual tools of animal ethology and ecological
succession.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
Archaeology appears to be addicted to metanarratives, whether historical
or processual in character. These might concern themselves with the
rise of the state, the descent of <i>homo sapiens,</i> the development
of metallurgy, or the growth of urban society, but in each case they
propose that history can be understood as a seamless directional flow,
made comprehensible through the trajectory of a single variable. In this
respect, the visions of history that stem from the Enlightenment have the
modern characteristic of seeking to reduce ambiguity and impose patterned
order. Yet it is also arguable that the experience of modernity is one
of increasing heterogeneity, hybridity, and instability.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Modern science and philosophy sought to separate human knowledge from
human interests, thereby guaranteeing its objectivity. But developments
in the twentieth century appear to have undercut this project. In
the First World War the emergence of military technologies that far
outstripped the capabilities of the strategists into whose hands
they had been placed (mustard gas, tanks, railways, heavy artillery,
aircraft) gave rise to concerns over the social role of science. The
result was a series of initiatives to cleanse, evaluate or refound
scientific and academic practice: logical positivism, critical theory,
and transcendental phenomenology. Yet this "crisis of knowledge" was less
profound than that which followed the Second World War, and in particular
the Holocaust. Given that a highly civilized and technologically
sophisticated nation had undertaken systematically to murder part of
its population, using the full resources of bureaucracy and science,
the belief that the Western world was moving inexorably toward universal
perfection was difficult to sustain. Indeed, Jean-Fran&#x000E7;ois Lyotard
has identified the principal characteristic of a postmodern era as an
"incredulity toward metanarratives."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
After Auschwitz it is impossible to believe in universal progress. This
raises an important question for archaeology: where does its own
predilection for grand narratives stand in this new intellectual climate?

Interiority and the individual
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
We have seen that Cuvier's comparative anatomy established that the
outward appearance of an organism might not provide all of the salient
information about it. Foucault presents Cuvier's ideas in the context
of a more general explosion of "structural" thinking at around 1800
<small>A.D.</small>, which also encompassed the study of language and
the analysis of wealth.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
However, it is possible to argue that this horizon was prered by
a growing tension between the classificatory mode of knowing and a
developing sense of human interiority. Charles Taylor has suggested
that the notion of an "inner self" first developed within Christianity,
and was made explicit by Augustine.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Augustine proposed the inward turn into introspection as a way of
approaching God,


<b></b>


so that the truth is located deep within ourselves. Later, the inner world
became a space in which hidden desires might lurk, and which needed to
be carefully monitored through the confessional. Arguably, this concern
with interiority was elaborated in the modern era, in which human beings
came to be understood as having "two insides": a body interior composed of
organs and tissues, and a mind. This is very much what Heidegger refers to
when he describes the modern conception of the person as a creature "built
in layers"; a biological body to which a mind or soul has been added.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
On this view the mind is a separate entity from the body, and could
exist independently from and prior to it. There is an obvious parallel
between this Cartesian mind that precedes the body, and the Hobbesian
individual, who precedes his or her involvement in social relations.
<p>
Throughout much of the twentieth century archaeology has been dominated
by perspectives which emphasize the social whole. Culture-historic
archaeology relied upon the norms and values that are passed from
generation to generation, and collective identities rather than
human action, while the ecological functionalism of the 1960s and
1970s presented communities as adaptive totalities. Unfortunately, the
eventual reaction against these views has involved the identification of
the autonomous individual as a universal category. Recent arguments have
argued that the individual is a self-contained, embodied consciousness,
and have advocated the identification of distinct personalities and
biographies in the past.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
One might object that "individuality" is in any case only a cultural
fiction of modernity, a condition to which modern Westerners aspire,
even if complete personal autonomy is a practical impossibility. Given
the strong ethnographic evidence that many people neither understand
themselves nor act as "individuals,"
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
the concept is one which may be both anachronistic and ethnocentric
when applied to the distant past. However, the way in which a model
of the person that grew up in the period following the Renaissance
is so easily resorted to as an alternative to undifferentiated social
totalities again points to the way in which archaeology finds itself
immersed in modern ways of thinking.

<!--_a-head-->
Depth and surface
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
The vision of a body exterior containing a bundle of organs, or concealing
a mind, expresses a relationship between inside and outside which became
increasingly prevalent after 1800. Importantly, it was at precisely
this point that antiquarianism was transformed into archaeology. It is
broadly accepted that the innovation that enabled this change to take
place was the introduction of <i>stratification</i>.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
In geology, James Hutton's <i>Theory of the Earth</i>  and
William Smith's <i>Strata Identified by Organised Fossils</i> 
were together responsible for a view of the earth as continuously
changing through the actions of heat, pressure and weathering, and in the
process building up sequences of strata which contained chronologically
diagnostic fossil remains.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
The lesson that was learned from this was that the pattern of topography
could be understood through the stratified rocks beneath the surface,
just as the pathology of human bodies could be grasped by opening up
corpses. Archaeologists now began to appreciate


<b></b>


the sequences of events represented by the accumulation of layers of soil
and debris on ancient sites, and a relationship between the depth of time
and the depth of deposit became a critical element in the archaeological
imagination. It is of enormous significance that archaeology became
identifiable as a discipline at precisely the point when, according to
Foucault, "man" as a discursive object first appeared on the scene.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
"Man," in this sense, is what occurs when human beings cease to be one
species amongst others, and become the point at which biology, history,
and statecraft meet; at once an object of empirical observation,
a problem of population, order and management, and the knower of
knowledge. As such, "man" is the meeting point of historical process
and human finitude, and this is just what archaeology has concerned
itself with, from its earliest appearance. Archaeology identifies the
cultural works and physical remains of human beings, and places them in
the context of a temporal sequence established through a relationship
between depth and surface.
<p>
Fredric Jameson has argued that "depth models" are the hallmark of
modern thinking.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
The examples that he provides include the relationship between speech
and grammar in structuralism, essence and appearance in Marxism,
authenticity and inauthenticity in existentialism, and superficial
reading versus deep meaning in hermeneutics. Perhaps because the
depths of the person are connected with the mind, the soul, and the
route to the deity, depth is often equated with profundity and surface
with superficiality. Archaeology was integral to the development of
this "depth thinking," and its embodiment of the recovery of hidden
truths from below the earth and from the distant past has provided
a powerful metaphor in other areas of thought. In this sense, the
idea of archaeology has been central to later modern thinking. This
metaphorical use of the concept of archaeology is possibly clearest in
the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud. Freud was an enthusiastic
collector of ancient artifacts, and was fascinated by the discoveries of
Heinrich Schliemann at Troy and Arthur Evans at Knossos. He compared the
task of the psychoanalyst to that of the archaeologist, clearing away
debris (the repression) in order to uncover neglected treasures. Freud
wrote often of the "depths" of the mind, and literally considered the
psychic apparatus to be stratified.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Just as successive occupation layers build up over time on an ancient
settlement, so the deeper layers of the id contained the collective
psychic history of the human race, which was recapitulated in the
suppression of sexual feelings for the parents and the formation of
the ego ideal.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
Freud's "topographic" model of the mind equated stratigraphic depth
with the collective and the instinctual, and elsewhere in his work
there are connections between prehistory, myth, and the mental lives
of contemporary non-Western "primitives." It remains a burden that the
discipline has to contend with that depth and hiddenness are associated
with mystery, insight and truth. This undoubtedly colors the popular
conception of archaeology, but it also arguably has a role in the
valorization of various forms of archaeological research. Our field
practices are often geared toward the establishment of a linear temporal
sequence through the deposits on a site, working back toward a point
of origin. Equally, the uncovering and recovery of hidden deposits and
artifacts is sometimes held in greater esteem than the interpretation
and appreciation of ancient things that are already


<b></b>


fully visible. It is as if by bringing things into the light the
past itself is being recovered. Forms of archaeology that concern
themselves with that which is readily accessible (rock art, standing
buildings, industrial archaeology) sometimes struggle to attract the same
attention. Yet there is a real sense in which we inhabit a past that is
all around us, and the uncovering of hidden depths provides more evidence,
but not evidence of an ontologically different kind.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Mind, body, and substance
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
We have seen already that the seventeenth-century project of overcoming
ambivalence through rigorous method was connected with an increasing
separation of subject and object, and mind and body. As a result, the mind
came to be imagined as a space within which representations are generated,
quite distinct from worldly objects. At least for Descartes, the mind
was a thinking thing, quite different in kind from the substantial things
of the world. These formulations have given rise to views of materiality
and mentality which still dominate archaeology. In the first place, the
recent fashion for "cognitive archaeology," increasingly allied as it is
to cognitive psychology and directed toward explaining the "evolution
of the modern mind," rests on the belief that there is a discrete and
objective entity that we can call a mind. This mind can be observed
through the consequences of its functioning, which are manifested in
the archaeological record as the traces of problem-solving events.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Cognitive archaeology proposes that the mind is an information-processing
device, and has an "architecture" which appears to be only indirectly
related to that of the brain. As with Descartes's immaterial
consciousness, it is unclear where this mind resides (other than being
immanent in the brain), suggesting that it is a metaphysical concept.
<p>
For cognitive archaeologies, the mind is like a computer, which makes
the world intelligible by inputting atomized fragments of information
and processing them.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
Yet there is an evident circularity about saying that the mind is
like a computer, when a computer is a device that has been created to
simulate the processes of thought (or rather, a limited selection of
them). What cognitive approaches neglect is that human beings do not
simply process information: they deal with significant phenomena in
a world of meaning. Only in a Cartesian world that has been declared
free of meaning does the notion of information processing make any
sense. Computers do not "have a world," they do not have background
practices, and they do not have shared skills and traditions.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
The way in which human beings operate in their contexts of significance
cannot be made explicit, cannot be represented, and cannot be reduced
to calculation.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
Yet the forms of evolutionary psychology that are currently being used
to address the actions of early humans rely on the understanding that
the mind is an entity that has a particular form, which is a product of
natural selection, and which is more or less successful at performing
particular tasks.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>

<p>
It is readily apparent that the division between mind and matter has
had a harmful effect on the way that we understand human beings in the
past. The implications of modern views of materiality are perhaps more
subtle. Where meaning has been banished


<b></b>


to the mind, the physical world comes to be understood as composed of
objects that have spatial extension and spatio-temporal motion; material
entities and the causal relations between them.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
Once the world has been reduced to these terms, modern science is
highly successful in explaining the behavior of matter. However, what
this reduction demands is that all relationships between people and
things be object/subject relations, in which consciousness engages
with discrete entities. This is the mode of engagement that Heidegger
defines as "present-at-handness," where humans observe worldly things
in an objectified, distanced and disinterested way.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
Crucially, there is another way in which people deal with things,
the ready-to-hand, in which we are barely aware of the entity at all,
and yet our relationship with it may be much closer and more profound
than gazing in an analytic fashion. Heidegger's classic example of the
ready-to-hand is the act of using a hammer to drive in a nail, in which
the hammer "recedes" from our notice in the act of hammering. It is
certainly easier to grasp this unthematized way of being with material
things in the case of a tool that withdraws into the project at hand, but
for the most part people "get on with things" in just this nonanalytic
way, and only occasionally stand back and contemplate objects from a
position of disengagement.
<p>
The problems that an atomistic conception of materiality sets up for
archaeology are profound. First, it points to one of the distinguishing
conditions of modernity: an attitude in which we understand our
surroundings as if they were composed of a series of free-standing
objects, which are at our disposal as resources to be used up. We
cannot assume that people in the deep past shared this attitude to the
world. Further, our ways of addressing prehistoric material culture are
overwhelmingly analytic: typology, seriation, measurement, quantification,
graphs, and distributions. But if our archaeology takes a form that is
principally analytic, objective, and scientific, we may learn very little
about the habitual, experiential, and involved character of everyday
life in the past. People in antiquity did not live their entire lives as
disengaged subjects, gathering information from abstract objects. They
dwelt in sensuous worlds of meaning, desire, suffering, and labor. It
is impossible to construct an understanding of the past on the basis
of artifacts and structures viewed as analytic objects and to hope to
somehow <i>unfold</i> a world of meaning out it. Meaning never arrives on
the scene as an afterthought, after the structures of material existence
have been put together.

Conclusion: Archaeology as ethical knowledge
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
In this article I have outlined some of the arguments made in my book
<i>Archaeology and Modernity</i>.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
In this abbreviated form, positions that were already broad-brush may
lack substantiation and nuance. However, the principal point that I have
been hoping to demonstrate is simply that archaeology is bound to the
modern condition at a variety of different levels. In some cases all that
is implied is that archaeologists have employed theories or frameworks
that are distinctively modern, or that their preconceptions have been
formed by the modern experience. This much could presumably be argued for
any discipline. But there is also a sense in which archaeology would be


<b></b>


inconceivable under other historical conditions. Archaeology emerged from
a nexus of modern ideas: the recognition of the difference of the past;
the replacement of teleology by a classificatory mode of knowledge;
the formulation of narratives of social and technological progress; the
rise of the belief that new knowledge can be made from material things;
the view of materiality that arose from superimposing the distinction
between mind and matter on that between form and matter; the emphasis on
depth models; and the belief in the naturalness of bounded human groups
that arose alongside the nation-state. This is why not all societies
practice archaeology.
<p>
Yet if archaeology could only have been generated in the context of the
modern world, where does that leave it today? It remains a matter of
debate whether we have entered a postmodern era, but if modernity were
indeed to have come to an end, would archaeology find itself moribund
and obsolete? Is the subject so intrinsically tied to a particular set of
conditions that it can only be of use (or interest) to a particular kind
of society? It is perhaps heartening that archaeology is undergoing a
phase of unprecedented interest in the media, but it could be suggested
that television programs on digs, mummies, and lost cities do no
more than feed a postmodern economy of groundless images and spectral
nostalgia. Could archaeology transform itself into a different kind of
discipline, to make itself significant to a new kind of world? Such an
idea immediately suggests the distinctively modern strategy of a return to
first principles, the creation of another set of new foundations. This
would certainly be inappropriate. A more modest proposal is that
although archaeology might not have come into being without modernity,
it could be changed by augmenting its present concerns with those kinds
of knowledge that modernist thought tends to excise: ethics, politics,
aesthetics and rhetoric. This is not so much a case of leaping onto a
postmodern bandwagon as of realizing a set of countermodern potentials.
<p>
That archaeology could be defined as ethical knowledge might appear
surprising. For decades, the discussion of "ethics in archaeology" has
been limited to questions of the propriety of excavating particular sites
as opposed to preserving them, professional standards of recording, the
trade in illicit antiquities, and so on. But it is also worth considering
that our relationship to the past people about whom we write is an ethical
one. Archaeology conventionally separates the present and the past, and
often considers its evidence (including human remains and the products of
human labor) to be meaningless until they have been interpreted. Moreover,
the people whom we study are dead, and feel neither pain nor shame. Yet
in using past human beings as the raw material for creating narratives of
historical process, we treat them as if they were fully comprehensible. It
makes little difference that the people that we study through archaeology
cannot look or speak back to us. If we reduce them to the atoms of a past
social system, or to rational foraging organisms, we subject them to a
totalizing logic. By failing to recognize that human lives exceed our
conceptual schemes, we do not learn from the past so much as organize it.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
This kind of totalization is close in spirit to totalitarianism. If
we find ourselves willing to organize the lives of people in the past
according to grand conceptual schemes, we are that much more likely to
find it acceptable to do the same to people in the present.


<b></b>


<p>
The ethical task of archaeology is to bear witness to the other human
being in his or her difference. However, modern ethical schemes have
tended to follow the Enlightenment belief in the universality of a
particular kind of humanity. Thus, they have focused on the definition of
universal rights. The alternative is to concentrate less on the autonomy
of universal individuals, but rather on the relational connectedness
that arises from difference.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
Archaeology may have arisen from modernity, but it has the unique
capability to bring us into contact with lived worlds that are utterly
alien from our own, <i>even if they at one time occupied the same
space</i> as ourselves<i>.</i> This encounter gives us the possibility
of recognizing the particularity and contingency of our own way of
living. Learning more about the past expands our understanding of
ourselves, but it is essential that in doing so we recognize that there
is some element of the difference of the past other that will always
elude us.
