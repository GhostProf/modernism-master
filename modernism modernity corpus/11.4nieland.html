Indulge me in this undernarrated episode in the long history of modernist caprice. During the summer of 1943, Marsden Hartley made a visit to Madison Square Garden to catch "Spangles," a one-ring circus mounted by the Ringling Brothers. In early August, he wrote to his young friend Richard Sisson, an Army sergeant stationed in New York, asking him if he had seen this "darling show" with a white horse that looked like "a page out of Wm. Blake's prophetic books."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Hartley, who would die just a month later, also explained that he was putting the finishing touches on his circus book, titled first <i>Circus</i> and later, more showily, <i>Elephants and Rhinestones: A Book of Circus Values</i>. In this unfinished project, the aging Hartley would fulfill a longstanding desire to develop "the idea of acrobatics," and to "make [himself] historian for these . . . esthetes of muscular melody," for whom "life is but one long day in which to make beautiful their bodies, and make joyful the eyes of those who love to look at them!"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  And so, sixty-six years old, with sore joints and an ailing heart, Hartley returns to the place under the big top where his eyes can best get their fill: "I make the awful ascent by the stairways, alas no elevators in the circus, and when I have achieved this exhausting feat, I am thoroughly at home."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  This, the habitu&#x000E9;'s accustomed seat ("section twenty five or six"), is the very apex of pleasure: "I always have wanted to be opposite the flying trapeze," he claims, because "this is the act of all acts that I care for most . . . it is these artists who have always given me the most" (<i>C2</i>, 2; <i>C1,</i> 1). 
</p>

<p>
The precise nature of the acrobat's gift is elusive but of crucial import for our understanding of modernism's broad repertoire of feeling in the public sphere, as well as of the political 

<b></b>

asymmetries informing such affective modes. In exploring the nexus of affect and publicity in Hartley's work, I join the critical effort better to understand&#x02014;but not simply to recuperate&#x02014;the place of sentiment in modernism and the politico-ethical positions such feeling might entail. Hartley's work not only troubles still-current gendered truisms about "(masculine) modernism's programmatic antisentimentalism, its ironic detachment from love,"<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  but urges us to consider the exoteric structuring of modernist affects within and across a dynamic and reflexive public sphere: here, for example, through the spectacular performances that so fascinated modernists.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Indeed, Hartley's misty-eyed attachment to acrobats is not <i>just</i> feeling but theory, a matter of desire and its negotiation, an attempt to think a form of public intimacy ("the idea of acrobatics") premised, I will argue, not on a plummy fantasy of unmediated connection, nor a Habermasian "audience-oriented" intimacy that would train the subject to participate in rational-critical and market exchanges, but rather on a kind of subjective detachment produced by spectacle.
</p>

<p>
In his sustained connoisseurship of the private dimension of popular performance, of course, Hartley was not alone, but the stakes of his articulation of public intimacy, like the closely related terms of its conception&#x02014;embodiment, vision, exteriorized detachment&#x02014;were clearly overdetermined by his homosexuality and its own fraught ration within contemporary aesthetic and sexological discourse.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In this sense, Hartley's attempt to think intimacy through itinerant public spectacles like the circus also resonates within the discourse of queer publicness, of homosexual intimacies in the public sphere.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  At the risk of drawing too easy or anachronistic an analogy between Hartley's modernist thing for acrobats and contemporary queer politics, we might say that Hartley's acrobatic investments were attempts to imagine and legitimate, but not overly publicize, a fugitive mode of idealized relation. If not true intersubjectivity, this proximate grammar&#x02014;constructed of res both corporeal and linguistic&#x02014;flickers between intimacy and publicity, social attachment and detachment, emotive personalism and spectacular disembodiment, surfacing both in Hartley's painting and in his writing in the form of what I call, after Hartley, the acrobat's "light re." In what follows, I trace the graceful utility of these res and their attendant grammar: as their conditions of possibility emerge in the "age of blood and iron" of Wilhelmine Berlin, as they mediate Hartley's tenuous relationship to New York dada and the Stieglitz circle in the 1920s, and as they make their final, most eloquent performance in <i>Elephants and Rhinestones</i>.

<p class="noIndent">
As Hartley saw it, the intimacy achieved by the truly light re entailed a perceptual attunement to a larger plurality, the "hobnobbing with the universe" to which he was privy both on the streets of bohemian Paris and in that&#x02014;for him&#x02014;<i>flagrant</i> interior of Gertrude Stein's salon: "[Y]ou had much, in all human ways, out of an evening there . . . you had the quality of yourself and others, a kind of William James intimacy, which, as everyone knows, is style bringing the universe of ideas to your door in terms 

<b></b>

of your own sensations" (<i>AIA,</i> 195).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Like James, Hartley insisted on the complex beauty of a world of difference composed of "innumerable unforetold particulars," but accessed ultimately through individual perceptual experience, the "stuff of which everything is made."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Hartley put it thus in his essay "Concerning Fairy Tales and Me":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

I am related to the world by the way I feel attached to the life of it as exemplified in the vividness of the moment.

<p class="noIndent">
"Experience as delectable diversion." This logic seems simple enough: the more vivid the moment, the more bound to life one becomes; the more entrancing the spectacle, the stronger the attachment between the spectator and the heterogeneous splendor of outside life. And yet this moment of attunement is also red as a separation of sorts, a discarding of the "material husk" of experience in the moment of "delectable diversion." As Hartley explains this tension in an essay on the "new kind of poetic diversion" in the work of Emily Dickinson, a kind of "sublime, impertinent playfulness" is achieved through a "celestial attachedness, or must we call it detachedness" (<i>AIA,</i> 200). Here, Hartley offers us a decidedly modernist category, "experience," that remains strangely unrecognizable. This kind of feeling outward, we might say, is Jamesian insofar as its vehicle is the perceiving individual, but decidedly un-Jamesian in its centrifugal movement away from the "private and the personal" and toward the "cosmic and the general," in its seeming departure from the true self whose geometric locus James once identified at "the innermost center of the circle."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  For Hartley, as for Walter Benjamin and the Frankfurt School tradition more broadly, "experience" is a conceptual "hinge between consciousness and world, inside and outside, monadic subject and community," but there is no mourning here of the eclipse of genuine <i>Erfahrung</i> by enervated <i>Erlebnis</i>.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Nor is "diversion" a compensatory perceptual mode, as "distraction" is in Benjamin's and Siegfried Kracauer's formulations.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Conceptually speaking, diversion is delicious, rich with tasty antinomies Hartley toys with but refuses to resolve: the senses exist in a state of heightened receptivity and diversion simultaneously, and experience radiates away from the individual, yet remains rooted in private delectation. 
</p>

<p>
These erotic dynamics materialized early in Hartley's career in the streets of Wilhelmine Berlin, where the painter moved from Paris after befriending the German sculptor Arnold R&#x000F6;nnebeck. As Hartley explained in his autobiography, the spectacle of the Kaiser's parade renewed his "love for any kind of pageantry, all coming from early boyhood and . . . the coming of the circus to Lewiston"; in the "voluptuous tension" of prewar Berlin, Hartley "at last could have all [he] wanted of crowd parade pageantry public glamour and the like" (<i>SP,</i> 87, 86, 90). Located within this unpunctuated chain of res for publicness that joins cherished moments from 

<b></b>

Hartley's boyhood to the urban present of martial modernity, the Kaiser's parade and the "real Barnum circus" code and cross-reference each other. What Hartley conjures, as a result, is less a glib militarism that conflates war and play than a potent and portable fantasy of spectatorial release, of the joyous and intimate dynamic of "feeling outward" mobilized, in this instance, by the martial scene: "I could always know that I was quite like other people when I was with a lot of people. [The crowd] would take me out and make me feel outward and that has always been necessary&#x02014;for it is a very bad thing to live inside so much&#x02014;as no one has learned better than myself" (<i>SP,</i> 90). In this, Hartley's riff on the "man of the crowd," Charles Baudelaire's dandy fails to confirm his heroic individualism; Georg Simmel's "blas&#x000E9;" metropolitan man finds himself suddenly, erotically resensitized.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Most importantly, the sensual publicity occasioned by the Kaiser's parade satisfies the expatriate's need "to feel outward" in a way that manages to be both common (it reminds him that he "was quite like most other people") and intimate (it makes him "feel at home") at once.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Thus, this scene is remarkable not because it reworks a familiar trope of modern sociality, or, more locally, a common swerve in Hartley's career from inwardness to exteriority and publicity, but rather because it marks an instance in which these distinctions collapse: a moment of intimate pleasure that Hartley would repeatedly seek in public spaces&#x02014;in music halls, at the Kaiser's parade, or near the trapeze.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Hartley realized early on that this dynamic of "feeling outward" mobilized by public spectacle required a specific kind of body. In Berlin, the movement from the private to the cosmic was occasioned by the nation's thoroughly aestheticized military-political regime, embodied in the "Kaiser's special guard&#x02014;all in white," and memorialized in Hartley's <i>The Warriors</i> (1913; <a href="#1"> 1</a>; <i>SP,</i> 90). Hartley was overcome by the "flair and perfection" of the guard and, by extension, of the thoroughly martial German nation, whose "spick and spanness" and "cleanliness" in "the order of life [Hartley] had never witnessed anywhere" (<i>SP,</i> 86). An homage to this order, <i>The Warriors</i> mirrors it with a perfectly balanced composition and, at the painting's edges, a symmetrical dispersal of the soldiers within an abstracted field. The celestial, ethereal placement of these bodies as they march toward the setting sun (and thus, as Hartley explains, toward their deaths) makes clear that these are bodies en route to becoming <i>Geist,</i> political myth: "A real ecstasy for war is the only modern religious ecstasy&#x02014;The only means of displaying the old time martyrdom&#x02014;one shall not forget their handsome smiling faces going by&#x02014;waving hands, throwing kisses and shouting auf Wiedersehen."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Seemingly celestial, these handsome bodies are not yet truly light res; more pedantic than playful, they offer a hard lesson in the costs of a spectacular attachment, and one that energizes Hartley's formulation of public intimacy. Critics tend to agree that <i>The Warriors</i> marks Hartley's "first significant rative effort" in an early career marked by a reluctance to treat the human form;<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  further, this ration carried an especially intense private charge for Hartley, who had fallen for Germany's militarism, its liberated <i>Leibeskultur,</i><sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  and its relatively tolerant atmosphere toward homosexuality as he fell for a specific soldier, Lieutenant von Freyburg (R&#x000F6;nnebeck's cousin), who 

<b></b>

would die in the Great War in 1914. Given these personal attachments and the powerful associations between the German military and homosexuality in the early decades of the twentieth century, <i>The Warriors</i> works as a thoroughly spectacular index of private feeling.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Further, this exteriorization of intimacy&#x02014;anchored in the mystico-spiritualist theories then fueling German artistic culture&#x02014;implies an untroubled correspondence between formal exterior and subjective interior, a "heavy re" that resurfaces, in intensely gendered terms, in the aesthetic theories of Stieglitz-circle critics.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

If Hartley increasingly turns&#x02014;as I argue below&#x02014;to the light res that confound such easy trafficking between surface and depth, the War Motif series&#x02014;begun in 1914, as a memorial to von Freyburg&#x02014;lays the conceptual groundwork for these res' emergence. These paintings, including <i>Portrait of a German Officer</i> (1914; <a href="#2"> 2</a>) and <i>Painting No. 47</i> (<a href="#3"> 3</a>), mark a salient departure from the <i>The Warriors</i>'s unchecked 

<b></b>

rhapsody of an ecstatic collectivity that depends upon public bodies poised in martial orchestration and political sublimation. Though Hartley would publicly disavow any personal symbolism in these paintings, his friend R&#x000F6;nnebeck decoded some of the imagery: von Freyburg's initials, his age at death (twenty-four), the Iron Cross he received for his acts in battle. These symbols are superimposed on the trappings of the German military such that the flat collages scan anthropomorphically, recalling the lost totality of von Freyburg's body through a quasi-cubist fragmentation (<i>SV,</i> 152). The disrement and death that Hartley could romanticize, prior to von Freyburg's own, as a kind of martyrdom are, these paintings suggest, the cost of the spectacular body dangerously attached to a larger totality. For here, von Freyburg's body is literally all spectacle, dispersed into a field of military signs in a manner bespeaking not spiritual triumph but the painful absence of a body. But for Hartley, the recalcitrant exteriority of the painting is quite useful. Two of Hartley's more astute critics, noting this strategic disembodiment, have emphasized the "elaborate veiling, layering, and masking of identity" undertaken in these images, and suggested how Hartley "keep[s] desire at bay" here by withholding the physical body of his lover, how he diffuses homosexual desire "through the multiple masks of literary obfuscation, abstract style, encoding, and death." (<i>PGCT,</i> 179; <i>SV,</i> 161!=, 162). The implications of this technique can be drawn even more sharply: these paintings demonstrate Hartley's investment in surpassing the dichotomies of private and public, interiority and exteriority. As such, Hartley's lesson in the excesses of ecstatic intimacy in the War Motif series becomes a nascent theory of public intimacy: at once <i>all</i> sign and hushed, the paintings suggest how Hartley's attachment to corporeal glamour&#x02014;of the Prussian guard, of Barnum and Bailey&#x02014;was premised on detachment: on spectacle's ability to absent the self rather than present it.

II. "Vivacious Hobbyhorse"
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In 1921, in the crossfire of the American avant-garde's reigning aesthetic and corporeal paradigms&#x02014;the Stieglitz Circle and dada's New York avatar&#x02014;Hartley published his first book of criticism, <i>Adventures in the Arts: Informal Chapters on Painters, Vaudeville, and Poets</i>. Over and against New York dada's cerebral and detached treatment of the commodified, mass-produced body, Alfred Stieglitz promulgated what Marcia Brennan has recently dubbed "embodied formalism," a "general discursive tendency" swirling around those artists (Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, John Marin, and more peripherally, Charles Demuth and Hartley) whom Stieglitz promoted as part of his call for an organic American art, freed from Puritan repression and continental effeteness (<i>PGCT,</i> 8).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This tendency, Brennan argues, was rooted in a model of "aestheticized, integrated selfhood" in which abstract and symbolic forms were understood by painters and their critics alike as transparent, sublimated "analogues of the artists' own gendered presences," and "no divisions obtained between the subject's body, their spirit, and the world around them" (<i>PGCT,</i> 43, 3, 43).
</p>

<p>
Hartley's <i>Adventures</i> is literally framed by these discourses: it begins with an introduction by Waldo Frank, Stieglitz's friend and champion, ends with Hartley's essay, "The Importance of Being 'Dada,'" and is filled in between with a range of essays on painting, poetry, film, and performance, all penned in Hartley's quirky style&#x02014;witty, epigrammatic, and relentlessly Emersonian in its elliptical manner. Frank's opening salvo presents the author as itinerant, various, and profoundly intimate; his essays are "chronicles not so much [of] these actual worlds as his own pleasure of them. They are but mirrors, many-shaped and lighted, for his own delicate, incisive humor."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Yet they are also, by virtue of their critical publicity, a form of embodiment: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
When the creator turns critic, we are in the presence of a consummation: we have a complete experience: we have a sort of sacrament. For to the intrusion of the world he interposes his own body. In his art, the creator's body would be itself intrusion. The artist is too humble and too sane to break the ecstatic flow of vision with his personal form. The true artist despises the personal as an end. He makes fluid, and distills his personal form. He channels it beyond himself to a Unity which of course contains it. But Criticism is nothing which is not the sheer projection of the body. The artist turns Self into a universal Form: but the critic reduces Form to Self. Criticism is to the artist the intrusion, in a form irreducible to art, of the body of the world. What can he do but interpose his own?<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Notice here how Frank res the act of criticism&#x02014;the sheer projection of the body into the world&#x02014;as a secularized transubstantiation, one that reverses the centrifugal movement of aesthetic production from private to cosmic, forcing Hartley-as-critic back into a personalism and, by extension, a body whose publicity Hartley found increasingly dangerous in the wake of the war's carnage. While this frame is in keeping with Frank's relentless stumping throughout the 1920s for a corporeal nativism in American art, it sits awkwardly around the variegated essays of <i>Adventures,</i> which bounce nervously between the competing charms of corporeality and intellection, personalism and detachment, intimacy and publicity.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  As exercises in taste, then, these 

<b></b>

critical essays entail not just, as Frank explains, the "sheer projection of a body," but also, as Joseph Litvak puts it in a slightly different register, the queer projection of an excessive desire&#x02014;a sophistication that seems suspiciously "<i>impure,</i> contaminated from the outset by a desiring, and thus disgusting, body" within a culture wherein gay men "have traditionally functioned as objects of such distinguished epistemological and rhetorical aggressions as urbanity and knowingness."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  As an adventure in queer sophistication, Hartley's critical delectation stands not&#x02014;as Frank would have it&#x02014;in opposition to the "actual" world, but as its very contested terrain; here, Hartley's indulgence in circus matters, like the mode of intimacy these spectacles occasion, is as excessive as it is expertly controlled. 
</p>

<p>
The terms of these dialectics are established in "Whitman and C&#x000E9;zanne," for Hartley, the "two most notable innovators" in poetry and painting, alike in "esthetic intention" but divided by their "concepts of, and their attitudes toward life": "For the one, life was a something to stay close to always, for the other, it was something to be afraid of almost to an abnormal degree; Whitman and his door never closed, C&#x000E9;zanne and his door seldom or never opened, indeed, were heavily padlocked against the intrusion of the imaginary outsider" (<i>AIA,</i> 30, 32). Hartley nevertheless notes that Whitman's open-door policy fueled a corporeal extensiveness that was
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
at one and the same time his virtue and his defect. For mystical reasons, it was imperative for him to include all things in himself. . . . That he could leave nothing out was, it may be said, his strongest esthetical defect, for it is by esthetical judgment that we choose and bring together those elements as we conceive it. . . . So that it is the tendency in Whitman to catalogue in detail the entire obvious universe that makes many of his pages a strain on the mind as well as on the senses, and the eye especially.

<p class="noIndent">
With this critique of Whitmanesque publicity comes an important revision of the terms of spectacle: in imperial Berlin, Hartley's eye is insatiable, overcome by stimuli from the outside, ecstatic with the pleasure of an exteriorized self made intimate with the universe: "The coming face to face with so much life and art all at once&#x02014;was all but blinding&#x02014;but I have blue eyes and blue eyes can take in all things and not be disturbed by them&#x02014;except to be extatically [<i>sic</i>] disturbed&#x02014;which is their way of being passionate" (<i>SP,</i> 90). Now, he seems suspicious of the moment of self-absenting that&#x02014;in the Emersonian and Whitmanesque model&#x02014;enlarges the appetite of a gluttonous "I." These "primitives" have "voiced most of all the imperative need of essential personalism, of direct expression out of direct experience, with an eye to nothing but quality and proportion" (<i>AIA,</i> 36). Whitman's limitation, then, is not his personalism, but the centrifugal movement of his senses. The excesses of the mystical eye, we might say, must be chastened by the kind of discrimination and taste found in C&#x000E9;zanne: "It is the mark of good taste to reject that which is unessential, and the 'tact of omission,' well exemplified in C&#x000E9;zanne, has been found excellently axiomatic" (<i>AIA,</i> 34). 
</p>

<p>
For the training of the newly tractable eye, and for an example of the controlled relations such sight, and such spectacles, occasion, Hartley turns to the popular performances of vaudeville and the circus in three thematically related essays: "The Twilight 

<b></b>

of the Acrobat," "Vaudeville," and "A Charming Equestrienne," all written between 1917 and 1920. Musing wistfully on the acrobat's "aesthetic" death as "Twilight" opens, Hartley pouts that in contemporary variety "everything seems tuxedoed for drawing room purposes," and blames this loathsome state on "the so-called politeness . . . of the elimination of our once revered acrobats. The circus notion has been replaced by the parlor entertainment notion" (<i>AIA,</i> 156,158).<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The "variety that was once a joy is now a bore," and the "habitual patron can no longer endure the offerings of the present time with a degree of pleasure, much less with ease" (<i>AIA,</i> 160). So Hartley promptly calls for "the re-creation of variety into something more conducive to light pleasure for the eye," heralding the "return of the acrobat in a more modern dress" (<i>AIA,</i> 160).

Wishing aloud, in vain, for a "Beardsley of the stage," a messianic set designer who might best frame his scopic pleasure, Hartley will go it alone, indulging in hypothetical fancy: the acrobats "need first of all large plain spaces upon which to perform, and enjoy their own remarkably devised patterns of body" (<i>AIA,</i> 163, 162-3).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  This enjoyment is both the performer's narcissistic self-enjoyment as spectacle (the equestrienne "exquisitely in harmony with herself") and, paradoxically, a spectatorial pleasure premised on "intimacy with the beauty" of the performer, which Hartley would intensify, in his example, by relocating the Brothers Rath acrobats to the coveted center of the bill (<i>AIA,</i> 163). And it is this scene's paradoxical nature&#x02014;the way the performers' theatricalized isolation heightens spectatorial intimacy&#x02014;that pleases Hartley. The intimacy it imagines between the acrobat's body and the spectator's eye is mediated by beauty, made tractable by framing, orchestration, and discernment. In this way, when Hartley's fantasies of orchestration seem most excessive they are, in fact, the most controlled, the most tasteful, and thus, the most delightful.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Indeed, while Hartley decries the enervating ornamentation of higher vaudeville, his own set design nevertheless goes for baroque:

There should be a large stage for many elephants, ponies, dogs, tigers, seals. The stage should then be made more intimate for the solos, duets, trios, and quartets among the acrobats. I think a larger public should be made more aware of the beauty and skill of these people, who spend their lives in perfecting grace and power of body, creating the always fascinating pattern and form, orchestration if you will, the orchestration of the muscles into a complete whole.

Another fantasy of drilled res, this dream recalls the Kaiser's parade, the drama of sublimated bodies whose exposure, in von Freyburg's case, promises politico-spiritual totality but ends in death and loss. Hartley himself draws the mnemonic links between this playful project of corporeal orchestration and a historical moment of prewar erotic plenitude in "A Charming Equestrienne," when he dates his "happiest memories" of circus expression, of the "artists of bodily vigor, of muscular melody" to "the streets of Paris before the war, the incomparably lovely f&#x000EA;tes. Only the sun knows where these dear artists may be now" (<i>AIA,</i> 176, 175, 176). (In fact, the language here anticipates his later description of <i>The Warriors</i> in his autobiography who, remember, "went out into the sun and didn't come back.")<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Thus, Hartley's circus fantasy is both nostalgic, harking back to a prelapsarian, prewar intimacy, and strategic, remembering erotic fullness within the controlled domain of "light pleasure for the eye" (<i>AIA,</i> 160). 
</p>

<p>
More than just the fruit of Hartley's erotic investment in the acrobat's body, intimacy (again, of a decidedly tractable sort) provides the foundation of what he calls the "idea of acrobatics": the functionality of the acrobat both as a body viewed and as a mode of embodiment, a visible object of "light pleasure" and a re of proximate relation. Consider, for example, Hartley's rendering in the "Vaudeville" essay of an especially striking "acrobatic novelty" in "The Legroh's" act: "This 'Legroh' knows how to make a superb pattern with his body, and the things he does with it are done with such ease and skill as to make you forget the actual physical effort and you are lost for the time being in the beauty of this muscular kaleidoscopic brilliancy. You feel it is like a 'puzzle&#x02014;find the man,' for a time" (<i>AIA,</i> 171-2). Offering the performative version of the same "puzzle" of the War Motif series, the acrobat's skill is his ability to trace a pattern so spectacular that it absents the performer, whose humanity (find the man!) transforms into "lovely flower and animal forms," or even more abstractly, into "ever changing ever shifting bits of colour" and pattern (<i>AIA,</i> 172). This loss is doubled in the spectator, whose purely visual pleasure unburdens him of thought as "the tumbling blocks of the brain . . . fall into heaps": "You have no chance for the fatigue of problem [<i>sic</i>]. You are at rest as far as thinking is concerned. It is something for the eye first and last" (<i>AIA,</i> 172-3). The "idea of acrobatics," for Hartley, is oxymoronic, since this art jettisons ideation in both practitioner and spectator: "it is the art where the human mind is for once relieved of its stupidity. The acrobat is master of his body and he lets his brain go a-roving upon other matters, if he has one" (<i>AIA,</i> 173). Issuing from the acrobat's mindlessness (a state surely anathema to Duchamp and Picabia) is a silence that is itself useful for Hartley, suggestive of a Jamesian sociality: "He is expected to be silent. He would agree with William James, transposing 'music prevents thinking' into 'talking prevents silence.' In so many instances, it prevents conversation. That is why I like tea chit-chat. Words are never meant to mean anything then. They are simply given legs and wings, and they jump and fly. They land where they can, and fall flat if they must" (<i>AIA,</i> 173). The logic is seemingly paradoxical&#x02014;talking prevents silence <i>and</i> conversation&#x02014;until we realize that Hartley is after a kind of talking situated precisely on the seam of sociality. The privileged quiescence of the acrobat hinges on a special, physical language that in becoming publicly embodied (like 

<b></b>

the words that, in tea-talk, sprout appendages) is evacuated of heavy significance and deep interiority. Unlike the more familiar mode of modernist impersonality as, for example, T. S. Eliot defines it&#x02014;wherein the poet detaches from the enervating immediacy of modern personation by finally embedding his language in the marrow of cultural tradition&#x02014;Hartley depersonalizes in order to preserve less entangling interpersonal connections, to facilitate more mobile, more tractable attachments.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Hostile, like Eliot, to romantic notions of interiority, Harley idealizes a language whose lightness enables an intersubjective condition at once flighty and controlled.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Not saddled with ponderous meaning, this tacit speech allows the agile ego to absent itself by becoming entirely spectacular, relieved of semantic weightiness and, by extension, of the burden of corporeal transparency.

Given the logic of sexual transparency espoused by the Stieglitz circle, the terms of Paul Rosenfeld's review of <i>Adventures</i> fail to surprise.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Picking up on the book's campy ostentation, Rosenfeld notes how "Hartley has striven to make his writing a superior sort of talk, part of a seriously developed aesthetic of a spirit exquisitely civilized and urbane."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  But he dismisses the "more simple, more slight, more fluffily iridescent" prose of <i>Adventures</i> as an attempt

Grace and charm and peacock-like magnificence hide and yet betray utter fatigue with never having really lived. Author and audience are in tacit conspiracy to fix their minds on some jolly and curious fragment of physical, unthinking life on "minstrels of muscular musical melody," on girls who play ivory and silver diamond-studded accordions, on the "brilliant excitation of the moment," that the immanence of death and corruption be forgotten.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
For Rosenfeld, Hartley's dandified idiom is all small talk: it fixates on the unthinking corporeality of its subjects with a compensatory intensity that would transcend an underlying experiential sterility (the price, no doubt, of a bad object choice) or, in still more cowardly fashion, ignore the heavy reality of the exterior, the "immanence of death and corruption." In this reading, then, Hartley's language hoists itself on its own petard: when it trains its attention on the physical, it is too light, its subject's seeming corporeality a mere pretext for unthinking detumescence.

<p>
Dismissing the book's talkiness as the flaw of a gabby queer whose language and pigment are alike unmanned by a "vagabond <i>libido,</i>" Rosenfeld's review misses the subtleties of Hartley's argument about language, especially as this communication is red through the acrobat, who may be dumb, but is never stupid.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  As Hartley later frames it in "The Greatest Show on Earth," he "puts his mind into his muscles and into his eyes and he leaves purely cerebral concepts and words to their own natural futility."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Intellect and language have not been abandoned, as Rosenfeld would assert, but are no longer <i>purely</i> cerebral&#x02014;rather, they are embodied in a fashion that produces their "exquisite speechlessness" ("GSE," 88).<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  As "bodies made intelligent as well as perfect," Hartley's acrobats model a synthesis of body and mind as well as the kind of spectatorship predicated on this synthesis:

These eyes are the acrobat's and, potentially, those of his spectators. And this passage is riddled with a series of paradoxes that surge from Hartley's attempt to articulate the sort of intimacy this re enacts with his viewer. On the one hand, the circus spectacle produces a simple distraction; its sensory intensity provides a diversion from "inward dramas" and "the sense of life's disillusionments." In this sense, &#x000E0; la Rosenfeld, the acrobat is simply a re of detachment, and an occasion of the same in his viewer. But Hartley's fantasy is more ambitious: the acrobat's eyes are charged not just with "satisfying aesthetic needs" but also with the work of the material world. They are linked to the mind but their semantic yield resists "interpretation and confused commentary." They are attached to their object (they "possess synthetically what they encounter") and subject (they "make emotional history out of casual opportunity"). As such, they come to embody a Dickinsonian attached detachment, the conceptual cynosure of "experience as diversion." 
</p>

<p>
This experience, not surprisingly, is irresistible for Hartley, who concludes his essay with yet another circus fantasy, and one that he can enjoy not just as spectator but as participant: "If there really is to be a Heaven hereafter, then let me go straight by pelican air service to that division of it set apart for the circus and go pellmell for the rings and the bars, till I can join the splendid horde all turning and springing and flying through the properly-roped spaces and merge myself in the fine pattern which these superior artists make in what will no longer be 'The Greatest Show on Earth'" ("GSE," 88). In this passage, with its characteristic mix of abandon and orchestrated restraint (the space of ecstasy must always be "properly-roped"), Hartley enacts his version of dada as he formulates it in "The Importance of Being Dada," <i>Adventures</i>'s final essay: <i>"</i>I ride my own hobby-horse away from the dangers of art which is with us a modern vice at present, into the wide expanse of magnanimous diversion from which I may extract all the joyousness I am capable of from the patterns I encounter" (<i>AIA,</i> 251). This essay is not, as Brennan argues, a statement of "affiliation with the New York Dada movement" that inaugurates Hartley's growing disavowal of the personal.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Nor is it, as Rosenfeld would have it, a rhapsody of the "brilliant excitation of the moment" that trades fancy for life itself. Rather, Hartley's understanding of dada as a kind of capricious individualism is neither Duchampian nor Picabian but itself highly capricious, a jejune misreading of the movement.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Hartley is "a dada-ist because it is the nearest" he has come to "a scientific principle in existence," a principle of fanciful enjoyment that is nevertheless outward-bound: "I have a hobby-horse therefore&#x02014;to ride away out into the world of intricate common experience; out into the arena with those who know what the element of life itself is, and that I have become an expression 

<b></b>

of the one issue in the mind worth the consideration of the artist, namely fluidic change" (<i>AIA,</i> 251). 
</p>

<p>
This joyride remains controlled insofar as the experience finds Hartley tastefully merged within a fine pattern.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Rocking through flux with an engineer's precision, Hartley's hobbyhorse nevertheless refuses to settle, or to settle down. Rather than substituting the sterile, opaque, or otherwise detached dada corporeality for a vital, transparent one in the mold of the Stieglitz circle, Hartley's acrobat&#x02014;flitting on the seam of public and private&#x02014;allows him to think both at once. Neither, alone, would satisfy; the former forsaking the virility and vitality of the plastic body for the mind, the latter predicated on weighty and troublesome semantic equations between art and essence, text and sex, publicity and intimacy. Attached to the "intricate world of common experience," the light re mediates the self and "that to which I am not related" with a rhetoric of corporeal intimacy that, by virtue of its lightness, achieves a celestial detachment:

You will find, therefore, that if you are aware of yourself, you will be your own perfect dada-ist, in that you are for the first time riding your own hobby-horse into infinity of sensation through experience, and that you are one more satisfactory vaudevillian among the multitudes of dancing legs and flying wits. You will learn that after all that the bugaboo called LIFE is a matter of the tightrope and that the stars will shine their frisky approval as you glide, if you glide sensibly, with an eye on the fun in the performance.

Experience as diversion here remains resolutely childish, and this passage is not simply innocent, as Frank would have it, but strategically so. To borrow from Litvak again, Hartley's hobbyhorse res a kind of sophisticated na&#x000EF;vet&#x000E9;, riding away not from the actual, but from the monotonous actuality of "universal heterosexualization, whereby 'growing up' in fact means shutting down, tuning out, closing off various receptivities that make it possible to find the world <i>interesting</i>."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  In <i>Elephants and Rhinestones,</i> Hartley would struggle to disentangle the acrobat's vitality from his heterosexual deathliness.

III. The "Codona Madness"
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
If it is not the properly "historical account" of the wonders of acrobatic life proposed in <i>Adventures, Elephants and Rhinestones</i> remains Hartley's last and most sustained foray into the vicissitudes of public intimacy and the fate of its enabling res. <i>Elephants</i> is loosely organized through Hartley's ruminations&#x02014;ranging in length from paragraph-long bursts to four-page rhapsodies&#x02014;on individual performers, acts, lore, and trends in the circus, the institution that he has "loved . . . all [his] life, just as one loves one's dog, or pet canary, one's marmoset, or one's cockatoo" (<i>C2,</i> 1).<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Fragmented and fawning, <i>Elephants</i> is this circus fan's <i>Passagen-Werk,</i> and generally assumes catalogue form: Hartley lists the individual name of a performer or event ("Barbette," 

<b></b>

"Spangles&#x02014;A Continental Circus," "Grock," etc.) and follows it with his reminiscence, often driven by a wildly associative train that leads him across time and space, and then (usually) back to the subject under consideration, which is always both the ostensible subject and Hartley himself. This freewheeling narrative, while personal, sentimental, and quite melancholy, deploys throughout an inherently intersubjective rhetorical mode.As it was for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, "one of the few great artists of modern times to whom the circus was an intimate language," the circus for Hartley is a matter of "you" and "I," and Hartley's linguistic gambit in <i>Elephants</i> is to talk in an intimate language that approximates the elusive speech of the acrobat, to fashion a proximate grammar of relation from the intimate world of the circus (<i>C1</i>, 57). Not surprisingly, then, Hartley's linguistic res, like the privileged physiques of their corporeal analogue the acrobat, are rarely weighty. Rather, to poach the terms of Hartley's critique of certain acrobatic "egoists" like the Fratellinis and Con Colleano, this "type of work calls for a slight and agile re . . . for light res" (<i>C2,</i> 10). Such lightness, as a mode of gender (not, like Colleano, "too masculine"), as well as a condition both semantic (it is not saddled with ponderous meaning) and, by extension, subjective (it is an ego negated through spectacle), continues and extends the "tea chit-chat" he champions in <i>Adventures</i>. 
</p>

<p>
But in <i>Elephants</i>, Hartley seems torn between keeping his res light and burdening them with significance. Indeed, in the middle of <i>Circus 1,</i> we find, in isolation, three quotations from the British sexologist Henry Havelock Ellis, which appear under the phrase "Elephants and Rhinestones" on what looks like a provisional title page. These epigraphs, which effectively give the lie to Hartley's lightness, appear as follows: 
</p>

Taking the frivolous seriously and imbuing the superficial with interiority, Ellis's epigraphs reverse the work of the light re, making too big a deal of little things. Thus, Hartley would seem to overburden his light res, which now not only carry the referential heft of sexological discourse, but are here uniquely charged with "really reveal[ing] the intimate depths of personality."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Hartley's ambivalence toward his light res is, in fact, the structuring contradiction of <i>Elephants'</i>s rhetoric, whose lightness conjures a vital, intimate community of spectacular performers and "fan-atic" spectators, but is haunted throughout by loss, death, and the annihilation of the acrobatic self. At the center of this world, and of this grammar, is the drama of Alfredo Codona 

<b></b>

and Lillian Leitzel, for Hartley the lightest, most spectacular of aerialists: "I miss with a wide band of deep mourning on my arm those two grand artists of the air . . . both of whom came to such tragic ends, one by a fall while performing in Copenhagen, and the other by his own hand after the tragic denouement described elsewhere" (<i>C2,</i> 3). And as Hartley's language traces its florid designs though this world, his circumlocutions keep circling back to the personal and public "tragedy of the Codona madness," whose "holocaustic finalities" come to embody the drama of public intimacy, the obscenity of the exposed self, and, perhaps, the triumph of flesh-as-idea, a newly material imagination (<i>C2,</i> 7; <i>C1,</i> 8). In <i>Elephants,</i> Codona and Leitzel emerge at once as the ideal avatars of public intimacy and as the corporeal index of this relational mode's acute vulnerability; thus, the trauma of the "Codona madness" and the stakes of its imaginative negotiation in <i>Elephants</i> are only meaningful if we keep in sight the intense theoretical burden these light res bear in Hartley's imagination. 
</p>

<p>
For Hartley, to convey properly the intimate language of the circus in <i>Elephants</i> is to allow his reader to share his fantasy space, to undergo a queer rite of initiation into a kind of intimacy.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  His acrobatic "eye" depends throughout <i>Elephants</i> on proximate, apostrophic address to his reader. And so, while the manuscript abounds with a first-person voice actively engaged in the act of imaginative vision-as-memory, it beckons a reader and enlists a confidence:<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

"Between you and me": these moments of lyric apostrophe proliferate in "Elephants"as Hartley fashions a communion of vision with his addressee: "If you saw [the juggler Enrico] Rastelli once only, you would watch the dimness gather like a cloud"(<i>C1,</i> 18); "but you will know" ringmaster Fred Bradna "when you see him again" (<i>C2,</i> 6). The second-person pronoun, of course, posits an addressee, another subject whose invocation, as Emile Benveniste teaches us, establishes the "polarity of persons" as the "fundamental condition in language."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  But in Hartley's case, the seemingly commonsensical point that intersubjectivity in language is inevitable and is, in fact, its enabling condition is at once reassuring and profoundly unsettling: reassuring, because it makes him "feel outward," an exteriority whose rhetorical manifestation is apostrophe, a turning-outward; unsettling, because such communication always threatens to become, semantically speaking, heavy. And as a result, the balanced "polarity of persons" is thrown out of whack by a voracious subjectivity, and the silent purity of corporeal language is sullied by the tedium of talk. If, as Maureen McLane puts it, "intimacy happens if apostrophe works," this success is always an ambivalent one for Hartley, and as a result, his reader's initiation is always incomplete.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
We can get a better grip on this ambivalence if we consider the means by which Hartley communicates to his initiate. The explosion of first-person plurals that accompanies Hartley's occasional rants on the distasteful commercial attempts to provide "ultra-variations" on conventional circus numbers provides a clue: "A terrible show awaited us who think of ourselves as strictly orthodox in circus matters . . . who like our circus 'neat'" and who "like to have our forms keep to form" (<i>C1,</i> 29). "We" are an imagined community of real, orthodox "circus fanatics" open to a language of intimacy that speaks to the eye with special eloquence: "for the circus is the greatest spectacle of joy that has ever been invented for the eye alone&#x02014;the eye being the greatest medium of receptivity," and sight, "as Paul Valery says . . . the most intellectual of the senses" (<i>C1,</i> 3, 1). And "all you have to do at the circus as with everything else&#x02014;open your eyes and keep them open . . . you are I am [<i>sic</i>] talking like a real circus fan" (<i>C1,</i> 60). So, in the following instance, Hartley will attempt to summon the "quality of the thing itself," of the materiality of the circus, through communicative vision and the intimacy that is its goal:

<blockquote class="extract">

The circus is clearly a matter of physical presence, of a proximity that Hartley would intimate to his reader and that he tropes here in the pure, emotive communication of Rosie and "mister clown." "Animal affection," muses Hartley elsewhere, "is a very exceptional affair" (<i>C1,</i> 21-2). The sentiment might be simply laughable if it were not so sincere; indeed, it is not too much to say that Hartley wishes to love and be loved, know and be known, in the mode of relation of Rosie and her trainer:

<p>
Here again, intimacy is idealized insofar as it remains controlled, a simple companionship of transferred affection between proximate, knowing bodies. But delivering this sort of corporeal copresence to "you," Hartley's reader, remains seemingly beyond the scope of his evocative language and its synaesthetic aporias, its desire to make the reader see the smells and touches of the circus. As in most publicly mediated intimacies, the "potential failure to stabilize closeness always haunts [the] persistent activity" of Hartley's attempt to posit a "we."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Entrance into this intimate community of "ecstatic 

<b></b>

spectators" is premised not on literal vision but on visionary talk, on the ability of Hartley's language to conjure successfully first an addressee, and beyond that, the vital presence of what he sees and has seen. And this will prove doubly problematic, both because the acrobat's language, like intimacy itself, would eschew speech and aspire to a condition of silence, and because the more Hartley talks about "this vivid human world of the circus," the more it looks like death (<i>C2</i>, 7). 
</p>

<p>
If the success of Hartley's apostrophe is predicated on his ability to open the eye of his addressee and fill it&#x02014;lovingly, erotically&#x02014;with the vital matter of the circus, this communication eventually founders on the very nature of this matter, which proves mutable stuff indeed. The performers themselves appear before Hartley's mnemonic sight only to shimmer, wink, and then disappear: "Alas, what has become of all these little jewel boxes, and will there be found ring artists to keep the great tradition alive?" (<i>C2,</i> 4).<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  These characters are so fascinating for Hartley, in part, because in bodying forth sublime pictures of corporeal plenitude, mastery, and beauty, they conjure precisely the opposite: "The public does not know however that very often acute suffering is involved because muscles can stand only so much anyhow, and the life of a circus performer is never any too long, that is, for performing purposes" (<i>C2,</i> 12).
</p>

<p>
Caught between a desire to talk intimately and the urge to keep silent, <i>Elephants</i> achieves an acute poignancy, as community is imagined only to be dissolved, presence is conjured only to be forestalled. Put another way, Hartley's catalogue of circus performers catches an oddly welcome case of <i>le mal d'archive,</i> Jacques Derrida's term for the inescapable loss that corrodes all attempts to archive originary moments of presence, singularity, or contingency.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  This double bind&#x02014;incarnated in the short, but intense, life of the circus performer&#x02014;is most obvious when Hartley tries to breathe life into his Metropolitan Opera fantasy of nearly twenty years past by calling for "a grand opera de luxe program of those great artists in this field who are still living and enhance the present day values. There would alas not be a Barbette, there would not be a Grock, there could not be a Joe Jackson, but already I see the idea in outline" (<i>C1</i>, 52-3). Here, though, the vision Hartley would share with his readers cannot be materialized, fully fleshed out, because it is structured around absences: no Barbette, no Grock, no Joe Jackson. So, in one of <i>Elephants'</i>s most remarkable moments, Hartley will transfer his hopes from the real world to the imagination. This attempt to reconcile his desire that the stuff of the circus be, like the elements of Joe Jackson's clownery, "dateless and deathless" (<i>C1,</i> 48), with his sense that the greatest artists "have dropped out from their accustomed spots in the pattern" (<i>C2,</i> 3), is a work of fantasy that dismantles its own assemblage as it builds it in the mind's eye: "Let anyone who has loved this style of show all his life&#x02014;line up in his memory the high spots of his experience&#x02014;and gather his galaxy of splendours for at least one de luxe performance at the Metropolitan Opera" (<i>C1,</i> 37). And headlining Hartley's "galaxy of splendours" are Codona and Leitzel, in a position that signals the centrality of their absence for Hartley and for <i>Elephants,</i> whose rhetorical mode is now in lockstep with what McLane calls the "self-imploding logic of romantic apostrophe" that culminates (or collapses) in the elegiac: "Death pushes apostrophe to its limit; to apostrophize the dead is to 

<b></b>

trace the faultiness always threatening to rupture the fantasy of successful, reciprocal address. Such apostrophe gestures towards the dream of perfect interlocutionary communion even as it undoes it."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In Hartley's case, the failure of apostrophe to posit a presence&#x02014;for McLane, a "drama experienced most painfully and intimately within and by the self"&#x02014;inheres in the position of his most beloved acrobats, Codona and Leitzel, on the sticky seam of private and public.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Their specialty, as it were, is their ability to be intimate and spectacular at once, to encourage attachments in the spectators who enjoy them publicly, but to conceal or absent themselves by virtue of their very publicity. In <i>Elephants</i>, Hartley is drawn, obsessively, to the liminal, libidinal moments where the performers emerge into publicity, or&#x02014;the equally attractive converse&#x02014;when the public spectator goes backstage, inside the performer's dressing chambers. And the ur-moment of backstage pleasure is Hartley's introduction to Leitzel and Codona, a scene that is referred to once in <i>Circus 2</i> and no less than five times in <i>Circus 1:</i>
</p>

When I had finished with Leitzel for she was getting in the usual state typical of artists, I closed with her by saying "there is one other artist I want to meet and that is Codona"&#x02014;"There he is" she said and he stepped up from the other side and we were introduced&#x02014;and I greeted this bright alert person with "I want to write about you too"&#x02014;"G&#x02014;I'd drop dead if anyone wrote anything nice about me"&#x02014;"well, I am planning to try at least" I said&#x02014;"it may never be printed, but we must all wait and see."

<p>
In this intimate moment Hartley, backstage, talks with his most beloved artists, who are (as they should be, as they almost <i>always</i> are) proximate and yet admired at arm's length. They are clothed, we might say, in the auratic garments of the celebrity image. Leitzel, in a haze of make-up, is "all chiffon and glitter" and talks of her Bohemian descent (though Hartley suspects she is American). Codona, whose public performances Hartley has seen "numbers of times," is unrecognizable, and he and Hartley exchange pleasantries befitting a nervous fan and his object of worship. This chastened intimacy (fan to star) is echoed in the affection between Codona and Leitzel, which, like the performers themselves, like the love between Rosie and Mr. Clown, is "very simple." Their relation is less an index of heteronormative desire than, as Hartley explains in Leitzel's elegy, the ungendered "love of sweet-heart for sweet-heart," or, in a coolly professional register, the "deep admiration of one supreme artist for another" (<i>C1,</i> 85). So too, presumably, Hartley's love for Codona, whose supreme beauty in performance "can only be verified by those," like Hartley, "who have been privileged to see this artist at work numbers of times" (<i>C1,</i> 86). 
</p>

<p>
Strategically occluded in these imaginative revisions is the "ensuing drama" of this pair: after Leitzel died in a public fall from the rings in 1931, Codona married another 

<b></b>

acrobat, Vera Bruce, with whom he performed as "The Flying Codonas." Their tempestuous private relationship was a far cry from the spectacular, simple intimacy of Leitzel-Codona. It ended on July 30, 1937, when they met in a lawyer's office to discuss a property settlement in their divorce. There, Codona shot and killed his wife, before turning the gun on himself. What Hartley will only refer to obliquely as the "Codona madness," then, marks the volatility of this seam between privacy and publicity; it indexes the disaster of a tractable intimacy thrown out of control by the obscenity of the exposed self. In Codona's case, this heaviness is especially devastating. As Hartley explains in "The Flying Man," his curious nonelegy for the acrobat, Codona is the paragon of an "art that pacifies and satisfies completely because for here for once the mouth is stopped&#x02014;the intellect robbed of its powers, and the body is given full play to be its best and comforting self&#x02014;and what is better than a perfect body&#x02014;being itself, completely itself. The body is clean and the life inside and out of it is clean" (<i>C1,</i> 94).<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Now, as Hartley explains in his 1937 poem "The Trapezist's Despair," Codona is "the over-sensuous trapezist," whose "acrobatic vanity" got too heavy. With the amnesia of self-absorption, he forgets that the honorific "butterflies upon the silk of his garments," a costume he first wore in memoriam to Leitzel, were made both to remember and to release&#x02014;to make him light as this "little gauze playmate," who had "flown to the upper air."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  This chilling contrast between res light and heavy is illustrated in a magazine article (. <a href="#4">4</a> and <a href="#5">5</a>) that Hartley tore out and placed in a file of miscellaneous research materials he was collecting for the <i>Elephants</i> project. At the bottom left of the page is a photo of Vera and Alfredo in the midst of "The Passing Leap," which the caption glosses as the "most spectacular display of the Codona's [<i>sic</i>] perfect co-ordination." To the right, another scene of public intimacy, captioned: "Last curtain went down on the Codonas lying side by side as they fell, Vera dying, Alfredo dead."
</p>

<p>
In <i>Elephants</i>, however, Hartley is clearly displeased by this "dead end of love": "I miss . . . Lillian Leitzel and Alfredo Codona, both of whom came to such tragic ends, one by a fall while performing in Copenhagen, and the other by his own hand after the tragic denouement described elsewhere. The which [<i>sic</i>] was to snuff out a romance before their marriage, at which juncture I met them through the kindly offices of Dexter Fellowes in the tent in Brooklyn" (<i>C2,</i> 3). Swiftly, lightly, tragic denouement occasions a comic <i>d&#x000E9;tournement,</i> as Hartley rewrites Codona's death as a necessary erasure, one that facilitates his reunion with Leitzel. Thus, Hartley's grammar of intimacy restores a "celestial bond" of "ideal sweethearts" who had, presumably, been separated "forever by the indifferent spirit of death" (<i>C1,</i> 86). But what of Hartley's affection for Codona, and the sort of intimacy he res? The answer lies, it would seem, in the way Hartley remembers him, bodying forth his object of worship through the alchemy of the imagination: "Codona [had an] almost mystic sense that permits, when the artist wishes to dislodge the body from the idea, and the idea becomes a thing for its own sake; plenty of performers have no doubt done the same thing . . . but they do not have that special magic which is vouchsafed to the pure artist, who strives as it were to fall into the arms of the true meaning of things themselves" (<i>C2,</i> 4).

<p>

Codona's "special magic" is a mystic sense that allows him to transcend mere corporeality (to dislodge the body from the idea) and become a newly hybrid re for the substantiality of fantasy, of flesh-as-idea. The language here effectively duplicates the terms of Hartley's essay "The Element of Absolutism in Leonardo's Drawings" (c. 1939). Like Hartley's Codona, Leonardo's "creatures are of the flesh, but the flesh does not dictate their existence in his vision, he sees them as ideas, as symbolic representations of the whole thing, as the absolutist consummation of one thing" (<i>OA,</i> 291). Codona is no longer a mere body. Only in this way does tragedy become the stuff of comedy, which is sustained not by death and loss but by an aesthetics of mystical intimacy that preoccupied Hartley in roughly the last decade of his life, as he turned firmly away from the excessive personalism of a romantic imagination and toward a selfless art.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  As Hartley explained in 1929, "I want to be life and not myself, and how is one all tinged with questioning and tinged with mystic longings and relations ever to get out of the dull bondage. . . . I don't want to be condemned to spectatorship. I want to be released by it."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  With this release, Hartley revises the aesthetico-mystical imperative as he defined it in <i>Adventures</i>&#x02014;that voracious intimacy of Whitman, whose desire to "include all things into himself" constituted his "strongest esthetical defect" (<i>AIA,</i> 34). Fueled by the mystic writings of George Santayana, Miguel de Unamuno, Lucretius, and others, Hartley finally understood self-annihilation&#x02014;and the perceptual clarity that accompanies it&#x02014;as a goal to be achieved through precisely this spectatorial ecstasy, in which the spectator/artist loses himself in his object of vision, in the sensuous quiddity of the thing. Thus, this self-annihilation must not be understood as a closeted silence, or as the violent repudiation of queer subjectivity, but as the latter's very enactment in the mode of the light re's attached detachment. 
</p>

<p>
Keeping in mind this formulation (subjective release via optical attachment), we might return briefly, and with fresh eyes, to Hartley's puzzling <i>Sustained Comedy&#x02014;Portrait of an Object</i> (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). In the familiar accounts of this work, Hartley's self-portrait has all the gravitas of self-inflicted martyrdom, the body's fleshly surface overwritten with a dense network of images connecting, indeed condemning, the re to the death and loss of the painter's past.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  This subjective weight&#x02014;Whitmanesque in its attempt to include all things <i>onto</i> itself&#x02014;is only compounded by acts of critical decoding, through which superficial symbolism reveals a rich but troubled emotional interior. Read through Codona's butterfly, and through <i>Elephants'</i>s fantastic retelling of the Codona madness, in which elegy gives way to intimacy, the painting may tell another story, now of identity's comic undoing rather than its tragic overdetermination.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  In this story, the titular "comedy" is not bitterly ironic, but an apt description of the intimacy that accompanies mystical release. This reading would underscore how the eye, always an erotic site in Hartley, is penetrated with arrows aflame in butterflies, which ascend and dematerialize with acrobatic buoyancy. Within the logic of such visionary optics, when Hartley seems most firmly physical he is, paradoxically, detached and disembodied, thus laying claim to a privilege historically denied to modernity's others. Released by spectatorship, though, Hartley's disembodiment is no solipsistic idealism, and is less a relational modality for being entirely fantastic. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Irreducible to a sublimation or metaphysicalizing of desire, the sustained comedy of Hartley's light res discloses a modern mode of intimacy that is immanent, antisubjectivist, and finally enabled by the affective circuitry of a mediated public sphere. In this sense, Hartley's light res urge us not just to reconsider the nature of modernist detachment, to recover "all that is energizing and active about a depersonalizing tendency," but to do so with sensitivity to the ways that such liberating vectors "away from the psychological and from personal identity itself" emerge in and through changes in modern publicity and visuality.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  The public sphere is, of course, a familiar space of inauthenticity in modernism, guilty, it seems, by association with a disreputable constellation of falsities&#x02014;mass culture, mediation, the feminine, the masses, reproduction, and <i>Erlebnis,</i> to name just a few. Such commonplaces have been productively challenged in recent years, perhaps most forcefully by Miriam Hansen, who argues that the public sphere's value inheres not in its relative authenticity but in its pragmatic utility as a "sensory-reflexive horizon" for negotiating modernity's conflicting energies.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  For me, Hansen's account is compelling insofar as: 1) in understanding publicity as a terrain of experiential negotiation, she refuses to accept lapsarian accounts of the fate of an authentic public sphere in technologically mediated modernity; and 2) she complicates recent critiques of modernism's ideology of authenticity as suspiciously wed to a rejection of a certain logic of visibility. Drawing our attention to what we might call modernism's unseen&#x02014;but no less potent&#x02014;cultural erection, such critics notice the downright dubious trick whereby modernism shores up its authority by secreting authenticity to a private, interior, invisible space.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  Here, modernism's strategic inwardness must dismiss a too-visible, too-superficial, and thus inauthentic public meaning. In fact, Bill Brown has described the seeming inevitability of modernist interiority as "the mark of a limit within modernism's effort to accept opacity, to satisfy itself with mere surfaces" and noted how the modernist "effort to accept things in their physical quiddity becomes an effort to penetrate them, to see through them, and to find . . . within an object . . . the subject."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
For my purposes, such trenchant appraisals of a dominant modernist gambit linking vision, authenticity, and privatized interiority serve to underscore the very quirkiness of Hartley's sentimental meditations on these matters. Normative modernism's "iconophobia" has, of course, also been productively considered by queer theory, perhaps most iconically by Eve Sedgwick, who understands modernism's characteristic aversion to realistic representation&#x02014;its currents of antirality and abstraction&#x02014;as a repudiation of sentimentality and of the desired, eroticized male body that is excessive feeling's occasion.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Sentimentality, Sedgwick argues, is less a theme or subject than a vicariously self-implicating "structure of relation, typically one involving the author- or audience-relations of spectacle."<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  Hartley's iconophobia, as a painterly technique, was intermittent at best; but his sentimental iconophilia, as a spectatorial mode, was unwavering. The conceptual trick of Hartley's light res, then, is to show how a gushy optical investment is really an erotic divestiture. Take, for example, Hartley's visionary indulgence in the public spectacle of Codona's thingly re&#x02014;his "flesh-as-idea"&#x02014;which effectively flips both Brown's and Sedgwick's formulations: rather than 

<b></b>

penetrating, his vision disperses; rather than implicating the spectator, it finds no subject, only a fleeting attachment that Hartley secures by losing himself. The dominant mode of modernist visuality, as the critical accounts I've discussed here all variously suggest, depends on a series of relatively stable and interlocking binaries (public/private; exteriority/interiority; visibility/invisibility; surface/depth) and privileges the second term in all of them. In Hartley's eyes, by contrast, these binaries are strategically surpassed through his paradoxical formulation of public intimacy, and, beyond that, through modernity's "sensory-reflexive dimension," which is, after all, the light re's affective terrain. In this sense, Hartley's light res emerge alongside, but remain irreducible to, other privileged tropes&#x02014;the "impression," "innervation," or the "fl&#x000E2;neur"&#x02014;for mediating modernism's felt relations between its "insides" and its "outsides" amidst a changing public sphere whose own mediated nature confounds a more traditional trafficking between the latter.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  This would mean understanding the light re as an attempt to think <i>through</i> what Siegfried Kracauer once called the "motley externalities" of modern life, indeed, to revalue the surface as the site not of the experiential poverty of the modern, but rather of its dynamic affective potential: here, for an erotic depersonalization that remains a relation&#x02014;spectacular, to be sure, but also profoundly intimate.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>

See Hartley's circus manuscripts, "Circus" and "Elephants and Rhinestones," in the Yale Collection of American Literature (hereafter abbreviated as YCAL), Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. The first is a longer 104-page manuscript written in Hartley's spidery hand; the latter&#x02014;likely a revision&#x02014;is a typescript copy of roughly the first tenth of the earlier version. Hartley tended to type his own manuscripts prior to publication, and the typescript version, in one spot at least, is written over in Hartley's own hand. These two versions are hereafter abbreviated as in the text as <i>C1</i> and <i>C2,</i> respectively. Much of the language of the overlapping material in the two versions of <i>Elephants</i> is identical, though there are provocative changes of phrasing in spots. For example, Hartley describes George Cohan's seat at the Metropolitan Opera, and his own at the circus, as one where he is "at home" in the typescript version, though in <i>C1</i> he describes it as one where "he could really hear the music and feel anonymous at the same time." Taking Hartley's suggestion, I refer to the two manuscripts together as <i>Elephants and Rhinestones</i>. My transcription of the manuscripts has generally followed the editorial precedents of Gail Scott and Susan Ryan. Like Ryan, I have thought it best not to dabble with Hartley's running prose style, one characterized by an abundance of short and long dashes. Small dashes I have generally converted to commas, keeping the large ones intact. Hartley, <i>C2,</i> 3.

I refer here to James's claim in <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> that "so long as we deal with the cosmic and the general, we deal only with the symbols of reality, but as soon as we deal with private and personal phenomena as such, we deal with realities in the completest sense of the term," quoted in McDonnell, "El Dorado," 22; and his definition of self-possession in <i>The Principles of Psychology,</i> quoted in Wolfe, <i>Limits,</i> 78. Susan Ryan has also observed the self-absenting that pervades Hartley's work, noting how Hartley repeatedly "seems drawn to this idea of a centrifugal self-referentiality that leaves the self, itself, out." Again, Hartley's own comments are illustrative in this regard. As he puts it in a letter to Rebecca Strand in 1929, "My main trouble . . . is a passionate desire to eliminate myself. I don't want to be the object of self-interest that one is supposed to be." See Susan Elizabeth Ryan, introduction to <i>Somehow a Past: The Autobiography of Marsden Hartley,</i> ed.

Jonathan Weinberg, one of Hartley's most astute recent critics, characterizes the conflation of the martial and the ludic here as a retroactive dodge: "As if worried by the militarism and eroticism of this description, Hartley attributed his attraction to pageantry to his early love of the circus." This underestimates how, for Hartley, the martial and ludic orders were interchangeable to the extent that they informed a more systematic, theoretical investigation of spectacle&#x02014;and, by extension, of public embodiment and public intimacy&#x02014;that spanned Hartley's entire career.

As his cultural allegiances shifted, Hartley began to transfer the debilities of French culture to the bodies of French men, whom he found "degenerate," "most pitiful to look upon," lacking "in legs[,] and as to carriage and physical demeanor they are dreadful." By contrast, German men, especially German military men like von Freyburg, were "wonderful specimens of health," all "so blonde and radiant with health."

Hartley's suspicion is, of course, correct, and shrewdly identifies a particular stage in the transformation of vaudeville "from a marginalized sphere of popular entertainment, largely associated with vice and masculinity, to a consolidated network of commercial leisure," one which catered to the female consumer with "refined," "respectable," indeed "wholesome" acts&#x02014;opera singers, famous actors from the legitimate stage, Shakespeherian dramas, and the like. This transition was spurred on by the consolidation of the Keith vaudeville circuit, whose bills of entertainment relegated "sight acts" rooted in circus traditions, those acrobatic or animal acts "that could be appreciated despite the noise of arriving or departing customers," to the highly undesirable opening and closing spots. See M. Alison Kibler, <i>Rank Ladies: Gender and Cultural Hierarchy in American Vaudeville</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 5, 152.

Hartley wants to frame the acrobat's body rather than jettison it. Thus, Hartley's notion of masculine ornamentation departs from aestheticism insofar as it rejects the imperative to transcend the materiality of the body, a corporeality associated with "feminine" nature. On the centrality of this mandate to the aestheticist project, see Rita Felski's chapter "Making Masculinity: The Feminization of Writing," in <i>The Gender of Modernity</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1995).

Hartley does remark on a more debilitating excess in his critique of the American circus, whose only shortcoming, it seems, is that it is just too spectacular. Whitmanesque in its inclusiveness, it too is a "strain on the eye": it is "too diffused, too enormous in this country to permit of concentrated interest" for any but the most "alert eye." Instead of a integral viewing of the spectacle's masterful orchestration, one "goes away with many little bits." Here though, the circus's distracting, heterogeneous massiveness is, problematically, both a formal and a social problem: "It is because the background is made up of restless nervous dots, all anxious to get the combined quota which they have paid for, when in reality they do not even get any one thing" (<i>AIA,</i> 164-5). Here, Hartley's intimate enjoyment is explicitly threatened by circus dilettantes, which illuminates how Hartley's perceptual attunement to larger patterns outside the self does not always entail an embrace of social plurality. That is, it is not impossible for Hartley to bypass social heterogeneity en route from a local, spectatorial intimacy to a cosmic one, a point of some importance for the terms of his imagined community in <i>Elephants and Rhinestones</i>.

Indeed, the language of facing or entering the sun recurs often enough in highly cathected contexts that one is tempted to call it a queer nexus in Hartley's work.

Noting the gendered critical discourse that surrounded his work, Brennan speculates that Hartley goes dada in the 1920s because it was cerebral and detached where the Stieglitz circle was premised on an imperative of transparency that outed the painter: "With Dada's characteristic iconoclasm and critique of an authentic self, the movement offered what must have seemed to Hartley like a 'readymade' (if temporary) safe haven from the Stieglitz circle's persistent emphasis on the most intimate aspects of the self" (<i>PGCT,</i> 169-70). This claim is compelling in light of, for example, Hartley's 1928 essay "Art&#x02014;and the Personal Life," in which he admitted to joining "once and for all, the ranks of the intellectual experimentalists. I can hardly bear the sound of the words 'expressionism,' 'emotionalism,' 'personality,' and such, because they imply the wish to express personal life, and I prefer to have no personal life" (<i>OA,</i> 71). However, Brennan's formulation reduces the complexity of Hartley's negotiation of these competing avant-gardes: first, it assumes that Hartley was more prudish about acknowledging his sexual preferences than he was, as his enjoyment of the acrobat in <i>Adventures</i> suggests; second, it follows a broader critical tendency to ignore Hartley's abiding and erotic preoccupation with public spectacle; finally, it suggests that Hartley understood dada as Duchamp or Picabia did, which he did not.

<p class="noIndent">
<a name="FOOT40" href="#REF40">40</a>.
See, for example, his implicit definition of dada in another <i>Adventures</i> essay, "The Appeal of Photography": Stieglitz, Hartley notes, "will not care to be called Dada, but it is nevertheless true. He has ridden his own vivacious hobbyhorse with as much liberty, and one may even say license, as is possible for one intelligent human being" (<i>AIA,</i> 111).

If Hartley's hobbyhorse has a genealogy, we might say it is drawn from the toybox of what Richard Sheppard dubs mystical or "triune" dada, whose commitment to a polyphonic subjectivity equipped to negotiate the flux of creation entails imagining res&#x02014;Jean Arp's "Kaspar," Kurt Schwitters's "Anna Blume," Richard Huelsenbeck's "Mafarka," and Tristan Tzara's cosmic acrobats&#x02014;that transcend the binaries they hold in balance: matter and spirit, human and animal, male and female, material world and cosmos. Hartley's acrobat does similar work for the public/private binary. Sheppard draws a useful distinction between the French dadaists Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia, who viewed nature as "inherently patternless" and "proclaim[ed] the Dada state of mind <i>against</i> a background of absurdity and chaos," and Zurich dada and the non-Marxist Berlin dadaists, who, by contrast, "were prepared to affirm or at least countenance the coexistence in Nature of chaos and elusive pattern, dynamism and fluid structure." Hartley's embrace of flux and his desire to be merged into pattern aligns him clearly with the latter.

In this sense, <i>Elephants</i> returns to Hartley's interest in the autobiographical mode as a means of exploring the connection between vision and memory, and of gauging the potential of what Ryan calls "synthetic visual memory," wherein "the form visually scrutinized and the imprint on the mind of the form once seen come together in an act that is partly sensory and partly mechanical, but that is equally intimate and emotive&#x02014;a compound of viewer and viewed." As Ryan notes, Hartley flirted with autobiography throughout his life, starting with the essay "Concerning Fairy Tales and Me" and, I would argue, culminating in <i>Elephants</i>. Ryan, introduction to <i>Somehow,</i> 2. However, I mean to distinguish Hartley's use of an intersubjective rhetorical mode here from Ryan's remarks on the intimate nature of Hartley's autobiographical experiments in vision in <i>Somehow a Past</i>. Ryan insists that the hermeticism of such efforts differs from that of Stein and Alice B. Toklas: "As opposed to the latter's externalized viewpoint that constructs a self always in the eyes of the other, Hartley's manuscript is clearly the voice of a man alone, talking to a reader who seems to be himself" (ibid., 2, 25)

McLane, "Rhetoric," 439. McLane's essay reformulates the dark logic of Paul de Man's well-known deconstructive essay, "Autobiography as De-facement." There, through an analysis of the metaphoric language of Wordsworth's epitaphs, de Man demonstrated "the impossibility of closure and of totalization (that is, the impossibility of coming into being) of all textual systems based on tropological substitutions." Thus, de Man laid bare how any system of cognition built on language cannot but forestall presence: "to the extent that language is re . . . it is indeed not the thing itself but the representation, the picture of the thing and, as such, it is silent, mute as pictures are mute. Language, as a trope, is always privative." This is especially unsettling in the genre of autobiography, which presumes to "reveal reliable self-knowledge," but in underlying the inescapable "tropology of the subject," "deprives and disres to the precise extent that it restores."

Even if we suppose that Hartley wrote "The Flying Man" before Codona's death in 1937, which is unlikely, his choice neither to include the details of this death in <i>Elephants</i> nor to elegize Codona as he does Leitzel is a striking disavowal of the denouement of the Codona madness.

Critics have read the painting as a strongly emblematic work of mourning and a conflation of death and homosexual desire not unlike the War Motif series: the flaming arrows allude to St. Sebastian, and beyond that, to a gay subculture; the pierced heart, like the ship, recalls Hart Crane, the gay poet whose suicide by drowning Hartley had commemorated in his earlier work <i>Eight Bells Folly: Memorial for Hart Crane</i> ; "the rose on his shoulder and the Christ re recall the various paintings associated with the Mason family," a Nova Scotian fishing family whom Hartley befriended and with whom he lived during the summers of 1935 and 1936, and whose sons Alty and Donny, beloved by Hartley, were drowned at sea in July of 1936; the "form of the painting, with a single re placed in the center against a dark background, over which the various symbols are collaged, is a reprise of the war motif series" (<i>SV,</i> 188).
