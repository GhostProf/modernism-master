<p id="lead">The year 1492 has often been invoked as the critical marker of the dawn of modernity. The year commemorates the beginnings of two journeys, one in which the Americas were "opened up" and the new world was discovered; the other in which a flourishing Jewish community was expelled per royal decree from Spain. Both journeys brought about multifaceted, contradictory, and unforeseeable outcomes. On the one hand, immeasurable suffering was inflicted on those who lost their freedom and livelihood through the expulsion; on the other hand, the groundwork for a new interconnected world of commerce and exchange was created. And at the same time that the Jews of Spain lost their heritage and culture, their fate gave birth to a new culture and language rooted, so to speak, in the historical experience of uprootedness.  </p>

<p>This nexus of discovery and expulsion represents a paradigmatic experience of what we&#x2014;retrospectively&#x2014;perceive to be the experience of modernity, particularly the dramatic social and economic transformations that we associate with the birth of the modern<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>: the rise of the natural sciences, the ascendancy of reason and rationality, the redefinition of the role of religion, the birth of the modern city, and the emergence of participatory systems of rule. At the same time, these phenomena were, of course, accompanied by the disenchantment of the world, the instrumentalization of reason, the loss of spirituality, the atomization and alienation of society, and the rise of totalitarianism. Modernity can hardly be seen as the marker of progress alone; it has always been accompanied by violence and suffering. Thus, it is more precise to speak about the dialectic of modernity, the hopes and catastrophes that simultaneously gave rise to its progressive and regressive strands.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Following their expulsion, European Jews no longer enjoyed the kinds of privileges and protections that were afforded them in the Middle Ages as "service nomads," to use Yuri Slezkine's helpful concept&#x2014;that is, a group whose role was mainly the delivery of goods and services.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> While this role as social and economic mediators was clearly defined during the Middle Ages, the beginnings of the modern era witnessed the rise of a questioning of their function within European Society. Over the course of the centuries that followed, both Jews and non-Jews began to grapple with what it meant to belong and participate in a society. The birth of the "Jewish question" is to be found here.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> For Jews, the question entailed how to hold onto a religious tradition defined by an extraterritorial bind to written Jewish law that assured them their social function during the Middle Ages. For non-Jews, who were no longer dependent upon Jewish mediation, the Jewish question meant how to deal with a large cultural and religious minority in the face of pressures from the Church and state. </p>

<p>As the famous debate between Moses Mendelssohn and Christian Wilhelm von Dohm brought to the fore, the Enlightenment was infused with the Jewish question, and the Jewish question was infused with the Enlightenment.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> This reciprocal interaction was crystallized following the French Revolution when citizenship was detached from religious belonging. In France, emancipation resulted in full&#x2014;although admittedly short-lived&#x2014;civil equality for Jews. While Jewish emancipation remained subject to contestation and debate during this period, reforms ebbed and flowed throughout the nineteenth century with regard to Jewish civic equality.  </p>

<p>With the redefinition of the role of Jews in European society and the granting of civil rights, the tension between a commitment to Jewish cultural memory and the demands of acculturation as a condition of social integration became steadily accentuated. Perhaps the best exemplar of this tension can be seen in the life and work of Heinrich Heine. Born to an acculturated German-Jewish family, Heine decided to convert to Christianity in 1825 in the hope of receiving his "ticket of admission to European society."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> Soon after, Heine realized that even baptism could not resolve the Jewish question. As he lamented to his friend Moses Moser in October 1826 while traveling to the North Sea: "It is very clear to me that I am most longingly forced to say goodbye to the German fatherland. Less the desire to wander and more the torture of my personal circumstances (that is, the Jew that can never be washed away [<i>die nie abzuwaschende Jude</i>]) drives me away &#x2026; For how deeply rooted is the myth of the eternal Jew! [<i>der Mythos des ewigen Juden</i>]."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> Heine spent the rest of his life in exile. His work is marked by a sense of radical ambivalence: No longer part of the Jewish religion but also scarcely welcomed as a participant in European civil society.  </p>

<p>The rise of race-based nationalism in the late nineteenth century brought a new dimension to the struggle of Jews to redefine their place in European society: the birth of modern anti-Semitism. In Western Europe, nationalism was often coupled with a rejection of the non-ethnic other, the Jew. In Central and Eastern Europe, Jews faced waves of pogroms that led many to define themselves nationally in order to resist the surging violence. A Jewish intellectual in this period faced a more or less set slate of options ranging from embracing a modern form of nationalism (Zionism) 

<b></b>

 to pursuing a cosmopolitan, universalist worldview (often of Leftist orientation), in which little room was left for conventional forms of Jewish identity. Born in 1873 into a traditional Jewish family and witness to the sufferings of Jewish life in Eastern Europe, Haim Nahman Bialik funneled his energies into becoming the first modern Hebrew national poet. Bialik's modernist poetry was infused by Russian Symbolism, nationalist outrage, and the richness of the Jewish cultural archive. On the other side of the continent, Sigmund Freud, never ignoring his Jewish upbringing, analytically dissected and re-construed the anthropology of religion. Moses' Jewishness became a cipher for human culture as such. In the spectrum of possibilities, one should not forget the choices made by res such as Walter Rathenau (1867&#x2013;1922), a politician and effusive writer, who fully embraced German nationalism; or Else Lasker-Sch&#x00FC;ler (1869&#x2013;1945) whose poetry amalgamated Christian mysticism with Jewish symbology; or Isaac Babel (1894&#x2013;1941), the voice of revolutionary universalism that becomes transformed into an ironic-reflexive stance. </p>

<p>In all of these res, we can detect a persistent tension between a historical consciousness and the Nietzschean "Now" that pleads for an unconditional concentration on the present while questioning a historical reverence to the past. This tension is the point of departure for the investigation of Jewish modernism in this volume. Building upon the extensive body of scholarship dedicated to the Jewish contribution to modernism, we want to examine some of the ways in which Jewish modernists negotiated this paradigmatic tension. We come to this topic from a distinctive theoretical strain, which might best be unfolded by revisiting Paul de Man's famous meditation on "Literary History and Literary Modernity."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> De Man argued that "to write reflectively about modernity leads to problems that put the usefulness of the term into question" because the very "spontaneity of being modern conflicts with the claim to think and write about modernity."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> That is, modernism's focus on the Nietzschean Now seemingly stands in contradiction to historical reflection. In the context of literature and philosophical writing by Jews, the tension between the "presentness" of modernism (and, indeed, of the modern era) and a culture of memory, which is, by definition, retrospective, seems all the more acute.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In soliciting essays for this volume, we asked the authors to go beyond what major scholars already achieved with regard to the 'Jewish contribution' to modernity: the genealogical tracing of individual Jewish contributions to the modern canon, the discussion of the tension between tradition and the modern, and the examination of elements of Jewish identity in the work of Jewish modernists. Instead, we wanted to raise more comparative, theoretical questions.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> The authors who participated in this volume are giving answers to the following kinds of questions: Is there such a thing as Jewish modernism&#x2014;whether conceived as a distinctive cultural-historical strain, the employment of certain aesthetic and poetic devices, or a kind of attitude or approach to thinking about the relationship between historical consciousness and the Nietzschean "now"? How can we redefine and re-historicize the very concept of Jewish modernism without falling back on either essentialist "Jewish" traits or essentialist "modernist" motifs?<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> What kind of specific methodological challenges arise in attempting to write about and historicize Jewish modernism? 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>Of course, the attempt to characterize both the "Jewish" in modern literature and the "modern" in Jewish literature is not new. The recent contributions by Ruth Wisse and Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi might, for example, productively summarize the state of the field. Wisse specifically asks what makes a book "Jewish"? She investigates the emergence of a multilingual, multinational "Jewish literature [that] violates, on the one hand, the concept of a national literature in a national language and, on the other hand, the traditional Jewish concept of a received literature that alone requires ongoing interpretation" (Wisse, xv). She convincingly argues that "modern Jewish literature is the repository of modern Jewish experience. It is the most complete way of knowing the inner life of the Jews" (Wisse, 4). For her, the most complicating feature of modern Jewish literature is its "relation to language" (Wisse, 5). She is thus less interested in the reverberation of the philosophical or aesthetic dimensions of modernism and more interested in how Jewishness is expressed in literature written by Jews. Referring to much of the same canon of Jewish writing, Ezrahi investigates the persistent topos of exile and homecoming in modern Jewish experience as it becomes reflected and refracted in the literary imagination. While viewing the experience of exile and homelessness as a fundamental part of the modern experience, Ezrahi cogently shows how Jewish authors internalized and expressed this problematic.  </p>

<p>In this volume, we sought to expand upon the range of questions, contexts, and themes through the integration of a variety of recent theoretical approaches to historicizing and conceptualizing modernism and modernity. Such approaches include the discussion of the tensions between philosophy and literature, the analysis of the fault lines between the modern and the postmodern, the mapping of transnational modernisms, and the status of visuality and textuality in a culture of memory. Rather than approaching Jewish modernism from within the context of the canon of Jewish modernism, we ask: How would Jewish modernism appear through the broader lens of modernist production? How would our image of modernism change if we were to include authors and writers often seen as "Jewish" as centrally expressing "modernism"? To this end, and in dialogue with the work of Chana Kronfeld and Michael Gluzman, we are interested in recasting the role of Jewish writers as crucially co-shaping our understanding of what modernism is.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> As Kronfeld argues, modernism often admired and even emulated 'the marginal' yet much of the scholarly apparatus that deals with modernism has tended to focus on national European languages (mostly English, French, German and Italian) while other languages and cultures in which important modernist works were written, such as Yiddish and Hebrew, have been comparatively neglected. Following Kronfeld and Gluzman, Uri Cohen's essay in this volume raises the question: Can we understand the death of the narrator in Agnon's <i>A Guest for the Night</i> from within the trajectory of modern Hebrew literature <i>and</i> through an examination of the broader, modernist obsession with death, such as in the works of Rilke, Heidegger, and Blanchot? To be sure, death in Agnon&#x2014;as the very condition for the emergence of a vibrant Hebrew literature&#x2014;relates to both the devastating external pressures on Jewish culture and the very physical existence of Jews in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14"> 14</a></sup> And, at the same time, Agnon's ration of death reflects his 

<b></b>

 ongoing engagement with Jewish historical sources from antiquity though the Middle Ages. Following Cohen, we seek to expand upon this approach to Jewish modernism by examining the possibility that Agnon's Jewish and perhaps Zionist ration of death (that is 'the particular') must also be understood through its participation in the much broader context of modernist writing and thought: How would our understanding of symbolism or existentialism change by including Agnon, a writer whose work is fully immersed in Jewish liturgy and thought and who 'appropriated' the modernist fascination with death? <i>And</i> how does our understanding of Agnon's "Jewish" approach to death change once we read his ration of death through the lens of existentialism? Can we read S. An-sky (as Gabriella Safran does) both within the context of his biographical Jewish background <i>and</i> through the lens of European primitivism? How do An-sky's ethnographic sketches shed new light on the history of primitivism, a fundamental topos of modernism? Instead of just understanding An-sky within a gallery of res stemming from Yiddish modernism such as Sholem Aleichem or S. Y. Abramovitsh, Safran places An-sky within the epistemological landscapes of ethnography and the fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle fascination with exoticism, two horizons that preoccupied transnational modernisms from Russian Symbolism to Cubism.  </p>

<p>It is in this way that we want to problematize modernism and modernity from both directions. We believe that our understanding of Jewish modernism stands much to gain if we see it as a determining facet of modernism as such; we also contend that our understanding of modernism itself would become richer if we think of its artistic and critical production as extending far beyond the territorial limits of canonical languages and cultures.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> Can Mahler or Sch&#x00F6;nberg's music, for example, be considered as operating within the conventions of post-Wagnerian European music <i>and</i> within the traditions of Rabbinic liturgy? Did Mahler's integration of non-classical, Jewish motifs into his symphonies result in opening up new vistas to contemporary modern composers? What would happen to the study of modern Jewish writing once we move beyond both canonical and conventionally commemorative approaches to organizing Jewish literature? What new vistas might appear if we were to read the poetry of Avot Yeshurun (1903&#x2013;1992), in which he mourns the loss of his hometown of Krasnystaw in the Ukraine, together with Derrida's meditation on "monolinguism" or Kurt Schwitter's "Ursonate" as examples of transgressions of syntax, grammar, and normative speech&#x2014;all things that were emblematic of modernism? What would happen if we neither delimited him to nor extracted him from the Jewish context? After all, the "peeping" of Josephine&#x2014;Kafka's famous mouse-singer&#x2014;cannot be restricted to modern music <i>nor</i> to the domain of the sounds of shtetl. This is because Jewish writers and artists worked both within the Jewish cultural tradition (what one could call with de Man "reflexivity") and the Nietzschean Now, in which art was invested in the promises and catastrophes of the modern as we find it in Joyce, Eliot, Mann, Picasso, and others. The study of Jewish literature and culture as well as the study of modernism stand to gain by this double de-territorialization: The modern is no longer seen only through the "masters" of modernism, and the Jewish is no longer seen as merely reactive, self-contained, or a subset. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Indeed, this is the approach taken by Barbara Mann and Todd Presner in their respective contributions to this volume. Building off the work of Kronfeld and Gluzman, Mann marks out the "vision" of Hebrew modernism through a constellation of texts and images drawn from the period of high modernism. Focusing centrally on the poetic work of David Fogel, she finds a "Fogelian passage" in his literary modernism, which not only accords with C&#x00E9;zanne's artistic practice of manipulating surface/depth relations but also opens up many of the same "Bergsonian" questions of memory, temporality, and subjectivity explored by the likes of Rilke, Mandelstam, Bialik, and Woolf. Using a different trove of cultural sources, Presner explores a quintessential modernist mythology&#x2014;namely, flying and aviation fantasies&#x2014;in the context of Jewish "body culture" and its hopes for corporeal regeneration. Situating his analysis around World War I, the catastrophe at the heart of much of the modernist imaginary, Presner analyzes the transformation of the Jewish body from a body of "muscle" into a body of "steel." Expanding on his cultural history of the re of the "muscle Jew,"<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> Presner shows how the Great War became the proving ground for Jewish masculinity and how Jewish aviators embodied, however fleetingly, the modernist mythology of flight in all its dialectical manifestations of nationality and war, muscularity and militancy, heroism and conquest.  </p>

<p>What happens to this cultural history and set of analytical questions after the Holocaust, that is after the effects of modernity's technological advancements took (at least in some cases) the shape of a myth centered around technology and transformed the ideas of the Enlightenment into a religion of reason? What implications did the mythical responses to the fears engendered by and symptomatic of modernity have for post-War art and literature? What was the effect of the murderous elimination of Europe's Jewry on the very ability of artists to create, and how did this 'event' co-shape the ostensible divide between the modern and the postmodern? Derek Schilling's examination of Georges Perec's "cult of memory" provides us with ways to concretely answer these kinds of questions. Schilling reexamines some of the structuring assumptions built into historiographies and anthologies of contemporary Jewish literature using the prose of Perec. Not unlike Edmond Jab&#x00E8;s' highly poetic abstractions of spatiality, Perec's poetics of anamnesis cannot be easily absorbed into accounts that restrict Jewishness to thematic approaches, historical periods, or essentialist geographies. Perec's "Jewish" prose opens up a "belated modernism," which is both temporally and spatially distinct from the traditional epicenters of high modernism.  </p>

<p>As if to sum up the stakes of the entire volume, Scott Spector echoes in his essay the widely discussed question, what does it actually mean to talk about 'Jewish writing'?<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> He poses an unsettling counterfactual reflection: What would modernism look like without Jews? Take res such as Kafka, D&#x00F6;blin, Benjamin, and Rosenzweig out of the equation and, Spector rejoins, you'll see. The result of his proposition and of the essays presented here, when taken together, is the creation of a new constellation that might help us to situate "an elusive object," which is not merely a body of work nor merely a register of authors but rather, as Spector writes, "a way of thinking about oneself and one's place in relation to the past, the future, and creativity." In this regard, 

<b></b>

 Spector's opening admonition is especially apposite here: "Jewish modernism" cannot be adequately elucidated by creating and analyzing a corpus of literature and art produced by people who happened to be Jews. Instead, by examining the reciprocal ways in which Jews participated in the project of modernity and the ways in which the hopes and catastrophes expressed in modernism co-shaped and continue to co-shape the Jewish condition, we can better understand modernity as such. After all, one can hardly understand the stakes of the journey of discovery undertaken by Christopher Columbus without taking into account the other, contemporaneous "journey" of the Jews out of Spain. As these essays bear out with impressive amplitude, Jewish modernism needs to be considered through the distinctive trajectories of Jewish history and culture as well as analyzed as an expression of the complexities and contingencies in the history of modernity itself. Indeed, neither can be disaggregated from the other.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT1" href="#REF1">1</a>. In his work on the conceptual history of "modernity" or "Neuzeit," Reinhart Koselleck entertains the question as to whether modernity is to be situated around 1500 or around 1800. Although, as he notes, the period around 1500 gave birth to a new world through the discovery of America, the emergence of global commerce, the invention of the printing press, and the scientific revolution in the wake of Copernicus and Galileo, the period around 1800 is the first one to identify itself "as the standard-bearer of a new time" characterized by the openness of the future and recognition of a new kind of temporal organization of the world. Koselleck does not, however, discuss what might be termed the dialectic of modernity, something that would have to be historicized in the period around 1500 and emblematically characterized by the discovery of America and the expulsion of the Jews. Cf. "The Eighteenth Century as the Beginning of Modernity" in: <i>The Practice of Conceptual History: Timing History/Spacing Concepts</i>, trans.

<p><a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>. While the concept of the dialectic of modernity accords with Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's famous analysis of the Enlightenment, we should bear in mind that there was no monolith of "modernity" or "Enlightenment" which led in an inevitable and all-consuming way to fascism. Instead, we must articulate the contingencies of modernity and the historical specificity of its progressive hopes and destructive nightmares.

Alter's contribution to our understanding of Jewish modernism remains unique in that he argues that the "Jewishness" of Hebrew literature is not merely a phenomenon of modernity&#x2014;that is, a modern creation that injects biblical themes in its creation of a modernist text&#x2014;but rather a dialogue with an ongoing tradition. According to Alter, the modern Hebrew writer stands in active exchange with both the classical sources of Jewish literature and the matters and topoi of modern writers whose work he reads. See Robert Alter, <i>Hebrew and Modernity </i>(Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1994). </p>
