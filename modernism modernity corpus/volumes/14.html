<p id="lead">The problem addressed in this essay is that of the poetic impact of recorded sound; and more specifically the connection between recorded sound, music, and poetry. This is not, according to one way of thinking, an inevitable connection, for in the phonograph and its successor devices the modern world has a way of recording not just the discrete tones of music but <i>all</i> sounds, the messy glissandi and dissonances of the natural world. In Douglas Kahn's account of the move towards sonic transcription--and this is also implicit in the work of Richard Leppert, Friedrich Kittler, and other recent media theorists--devices like the gramophone and Edouard Leon Scott's earlier phonautograph  means that the musical model for sonic reception which runs from Aristotle to Helmholtz must be rejected in order to open up the regime of sonic modernity, characterized by what Kahn calls "all sound" including noise: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Beginning in the late eighteenth and pervading the nineteenth century, three new inscriptive practices as applied to sound--graphic techniques in general, visible sound techniques, and automatic recording instruments as represented by the phonautograph and phonography--contributed to a loosening up of the reliance of acoustics on music. A plethora of lines made sound tangible and textual by making the invisible visible and holding the time of sound still.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">For Kittler, in a parallel fashion, this is the shift from the note to the frequency; from the arts to media.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> But that seems to me a premature judgement, or at least one which ignores the possibility that music itself <i>already</i> carries the notion of redeemed time later attached to the gramophone. This essay aims to examine that 



 possibility--in which music is already a technology--and its metaphoric location in the player piano, a device which might be approached in the spirit of Walter Benjamin's suggestion that technologies become most interesting at the point of their obsolescence.  </p>

<p>We can begin with three moments. Our first stop is a study in Wandsworth, South London, in the summer of 1878. A man suddenly rises from his desk and dashes out. In a sentence which comes as a mechanical rush of syllables, he later recalled that  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>he had heard a street barrel-organ of the kind that used to be called a "harmoniflute," playing somewhere near at hand the very quadrille over which the jaunty young man who had reached the end of his time at Hicks's had spread such a bewitching halo more than twenty years earlier by describing the glories of dancing round to its beats on the Cremorne platform or at the Argyle Rooms, and which Hardy had never been able to identify.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Thomas Hardy, for it is he, goes on to describe how that haunting dance tune was brought down to Dorset around 1860 by the "jaunty young man"; when Hardy moved to London he searched for the music, without success. Now here it is outside his door, albeit in a flattened guise--the organ-grinder has little English and can only point at the marking on the organ: "Quadrille."  </p>

<p>Our second stop is again in London, the Silenus beer-hall, that hangout of suspicious characters--two of whom, a small shabby man and a younger yellow-haired man, are plotting over their ale. In the corner an "upright semi-grand piano" suddenly lurches into life, its playerless keys moving up and down to a variety of popular tunes--mazurkas, airs. This is the player piano of Conrad's <i>The Secret Agent</i> , an obscurely potent symbol for evacuated meanings and automaticity which returns at the novel's end as a suitable chorus for Ossipon's derangement of memory, his obsessive repetition of that journalistic phrase about the "<i>impenetrable mystery</i>" surrounding Winnie's suicide.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Our third stop is an old poet, meditating in his study in Hartford, Connecticut in the dark days of the Second World War on those "times of inherent excellence" when the world collects itself. This is the formula he arrived at:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incalculable balances, <br />
At which a kind of Swiss perfection comes <br /><br />
And a familiar music of the machine <br />
Sets up its Schwaermerei, not balances <br />
That we achieve but balances that happen</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">This is Wallace Stevens, who would declare that "The leaves were falling like notes from a piano"--a declaration which, as we will see, evokes a history of thinking about sonic transcription.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>   </p>

<p>All these passages allude to the history of mechanical music which comes to fruition in the player piano, developed in the 1890s and entering many bourgeois homes in the period from 1900 to the mid-1930s. At that point sales collapsed; many instruments used in popular postwar "piano-smashing" charity events were pianolas.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The player 

<b></b>

 piano, and especially the self-powered "reproducing piano" launched by Edwin Welte in 1904, occupies an important place in the history of technology: a place between the formal sonority of music epitomized by the piano on the one hand, and the possibilities of storing sound offered by the phonograph, gramophone, and optical soundtrack on the other. When shellac was in its scratchy, dim, and shortwinded infancy, the perforated rolls of the reproducing piano offered, within the constraints of the instrument, the actual keyboarding of Rachmaninoff or Paderewski, a ghostly virtuoso performance, including "not only the correct pitches and rhythms, but also those elements which comprise the expressive rendering of the piece." Leopold Godowsky could be depicted listening to his ghostly doppelganger at a "companion concert" (first the artist, then his performance on a roll).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  "The performance of a master becomes the possession of the centuries," as one Pianola advert put it.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> Like the gramophone, this offered a real-time transcription of a sonic world, though one (and this is its mediatory characteristic) still tied to the discrete notes of the musical scale and to a human inputting--tied to the human hand. No wonder that Adorno was fascinated by the barrel-organ as the harbinger of modernity; no wonder too that modernist composers like Stravinsky and Nancarrow were attracted to the pianola; or that the American "systems" novelist William Gaddis collected thousands of pages of notes on its history, condensed in his posthumous novella, <i>Agap  Agape</i>, a bitter tirade on the mechanization of cultural production.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The sarcasm of Pound's "Mauberley"--"The pianola 'replaces' / Sappho's barbitos"--is one point of reference, though Pound also suggests some of the tensions in this field, later praising the avant-garde, technology-laden music of George Antheil for its sonic modernity, including low frequencies that "are merely noises that have not been considered as sonority."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> </p>

<p>Why is the recording of sound such an important issue? We need to remember that in the nineteenth century, sound offered a paradigmatic image of the dispersal of energy and the thematics of decline which flowed from understandings of the second law of thermodynamics. The stone dropped in the pond; the cry which echoes and fades; the absent voices of the dead--emblems of entropy, of the heat-death applied to social life more generally in texts like <i>The Secret Agent</i>. For Conrad's Professor this takes on a sonic edge: "The sound of exploding bombs" is his attempt to punctuate a world; he fears that these too are "lost in their immensity of passive grains [mankind] without an echo."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>   </p>

<p>At the same time, the dream of recuperating those losses, and the related dream of binding the energies of sound into a permanent form, has a long history. Kahn cites Charles Babbage's <i>Ninth Bridgewater Treatise</i> , which depicts sounds forever circling the earth, the atoms of the air carrying the minute trace of every human cry--there to be heard if only one had the means.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  This is echoed a century later by the professor in Djuna Barnes's last-published story, "The Perfect Murder" :  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>... after all, his Mistress was <i>Sound</i>, that great band of sound that had escaped the human throat for over two thousand years. Could it be re-captured (as Marconi thought it might) what would come to the ear? No theories for or against; no words of praise or of blame, only a vast terrible lamentation which would echo like the "Baum!" of the Malabar 

<b></b>

 Caves. For after all what does man say when it comes right down to it? "I love, I fear, I hunger, I die."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In order to see why the development of recorded music offered by the historically specific transcription technology of the player piano is relevant to this dream, we need to trace a pre-history of sound, beginning with Schopenhauer.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Schopenhauer and Music
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Schopenhauer was the first philosopher to place embodied experience--and thus energetics--at the center of any analysis of thinking, and to see thought in terms of the uncertainties of physiology and temporality, an uneven flow modulated by body's rhythms and contingencies. Rationality, for Schopenhauer, is subordinated to the desire which is the "Will." As Jonathan Crary points out, in his theory of consciousness "Time ... has none of its Kantian characteristics: there is no longer any guarantee of the contents of consciousness."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Instead of the Kantian synthesis there is a chaotic struggle to deal with the thronging world of sensation, emotion, and thought, and to rise into the world of the ideal. At the same time, it is the body which offers the best route to understanding the will which underlies appearance: the body is the aspect of the will given to us as an immediate perception. So while Schopenhauer follows Kant in linking the aesthetic to notions of detachment, and while he seems an idealist, in fact his work contains a powerfully opposed impulse: the suggestion that all perception is physiologically determined, and that the body's drives are the truth of human life. This also makes him the first philosopher of limitation--of perspectivism in Nietzsche's sense.  </p>

<p>For Schopenhauer, music is the greatest of the arts, because it is music which conveys the struggles of the embodied will. Music is independent of the world of ideas--of representation. It offers "the <i>copy of the Will itself</i>, whose objectivity the ideas are." Which is to say that music <i>presents</i> rather than <i>represents</i> the travails of the will: "the effect of music is so much more powerful and penetrating than that of the other arts, for they speak only of shadows, but it speaks of the thing itself."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Or rather, since music can have an allegorical relation to the world of idea, it is music which enables him to forge a bridge between the embodiment of perception and intellectual self-consciousness, between being ("Will") and representation ("Idea"). In this scheme, music cannot provide a representation of an actual moment; what it transmits is the human struggle to make sense of time: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>All possible efforts, excitements, and manifestations of will, all that goes on in the heart of man and that reason includes in the wide, negative concept of feeling, may be expressed by the infinite number of possible melodies, but always in the universal, in the mere form, without the material, always according to the thing-in-itself, not the phenomenon, the inmost soul, as it were, of the phenomenon, without the body.</p>

	<div class="attrib">

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This sounds fine, but clearly it <i>is</i> music's relation to the body, and its reception by the body, which enables it to transmit the pulsations of the will. As Schopenhauer makes clear in his supplementary remarks, music mimics the interplay between dissatisfaction or longing and satisfaction which characterizes the individual will. He writes that in our alienation from the natural world the will is aroused and energized, allowing us to become "the trembling thing that is stretched and twanged" (<i>WWI</i>, 3:237), and it is this painful struggle which music manages to objectify via a kind of twanging resonance in the listener. </p>

<p>The relation between music and temporality is thus a problematic one: music cannot in theory convey the specifics of a particular moment; indeed Schopenhauer describes it as the <i>universalia ante rem</i>, a predictive template that can be attached to later occasions, like Mozart used for a film. For that reason, Schopenhauer's conception of music is resolutely undialectical: he has little to say about musical development, outside the notion of a rising upward toward the ideal. But at the same time music <i>does</i> convey the human struggle to structure temporality. And when Schopenhauer discusses melody, he does so in a way which does--despite strictures against representation and program music--firmly suggest a transmission of embodied existence:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>As he [Man] alone, because endowed with reason, constantly looks before and after on the path of his actual life and its innumerable possibilities, and so achieves a course of life which is intellectual, and therefore connected as a whole; corresponding to this, I say, the <i>melody</i> has significant intentional connection from beginning to end. It records, therefore, the history of the intellectually enlightened will. This will expresses itself in the actual world as the series of its deeds; but melody says more, it records the most secret history of his intellectually-enlightened will, pictures every excitement, every effort, every movement of it, all that which the reason collects under the wide and negative concept of feeling, and which it cannot apprehend further through its abstract concepts.</p>

<p class="continued">The terms used here--"record," "pictures," and "expresses"--have alternative renderings: Schopenhauer's most recent translator uses "tells the story of," "depicts," and "imprints itself on."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Nevertheless they suggest an embodied "copying." Schopenhauer's insistence that musical genius does its work in a state which he describes as akin to the mesmerized subject, "far from all reflection and conscious intention" (<i>WWI</i>, 336), reinforces this, since mesmerism itself is linked to notions of transmission and the exchange of bodies.  </p>

<p>Schopenhauer thus bequeaths a series of topics--music as emotion; music as mediation; music as temporal struggle--to the tradition which follows, as well as a series of questions: in what sense is music historical? What does it transmit? What is the relationship between its formal inscription (the "Idea") against performance (the "Will," or the body)?

Helmholtz's Pianistic Ear
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>If one asks "what is the instrument which enables the transmission of embodied experience hinted at by Schopenhauer?" one answer is "The human piano." Or, at least, that is the image that structures Hermann von Helmholtz's hugely influential investigations of hearing in <i>On the Sensations of Tone</i>  and related lectures. Sound-recognition in Helmholtz's view involves a complex analysis in which complex and compound waveforms are recognized by the ear and rendered in terms of their constituent waves--"upper partials" and "harmonic overtones"--an analysis expressed mathematically in Fourier's Theorem, which states that any complex periodic waveform can be analyzed into a series of sinusoidal components.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The ear is different from the eye in this respect: the eye cannot "see" the underlying waveforms as the ear can; it has no equivalent to the sense of harmony produced by the ear's recognition of mathematically related pitches. That sense of harmony is fundamental to Helmholtz: he has no interest in noise, in a-musical tone.  </p>

<p>It is this focus on the tone which informs Helmholtz's description of the ear as a Fourier analyzer, which centers on the piano both as analytic device and model. In "The Physiological Causes of Harmony in Music" Helmholtz describes his experiments with the undamped piano used as a resonator, alongside the amplifying glass ball known as the "Helmholtz resonator" and the human voice. When he comes to describe the operation of the ear, the piano is employed to describe both its architecture and its workings. The ear is likened to a huge and complex set of resonating piano keys, "tuned to a certain tone like the strings of a piano" <i>(S&amp;</i>C, 61). The 3,000-odd arches of the cochlea--Corti's arches--are described as "lying orderly beside each other, like the keys of a piano in the whole length of the partition of the cochlea" (see <a href="#1"> 1</a>). This is a description of the pianistic ear taken up by subsequent English commentators like James Sully and John Broadhouse: like a piano, the sensitive human apparatus resonates to the music of existence.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> </p>

<p>The notion of mechanical resonance is what allows the idealistic, indeed in some respects Schopenhauerian, view of music as the transmission of emotional experience which Helmholtz elsewhere expresses, for example in concluding "The Physiological Causes": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Now gently gliding, now gracefully leaping, now violently stirred, penetrated or laboriously contending with the natural expression of passion, the stream of sound, in primitive vivacity, bears over into the hearer's soul unimagined moods which the artist has overheard from his own, and finally raises him up to that repose of everlasting beauty of which God has allowed but few of his elect favourites to be the heralds.</p>

<p>Helmholtz seems to intend this as a trans-historical contact, a counter to "Time's Arrow" (he was never keen on Kelvin's theory of entropy). To see this notion of historical resonance at work, one has only to turn to his lecture "On the Conservation of Force," where Helmholtz distinguishes the physicist's "conformity with law" from the human energy carried by art and music:

<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Every great deed of which history tells us, every mighty passion which art can represent, every picture of manners, of civic arrangements, of the cultures of peoples of distant lands, or of remote times, seizes and interests us, even if there is no exact scientific connection among them.

<p>Music carries the secret history of the self. Helmholtz thus has a conception of music, I would argue--and I am aware that this is simplifying a complex body of thought--in which the mechanical and ideal interlock around the notion of resonance and tone: tone is embodied music; feeling can be carried across time by music. If the interlocking of these ideas can appear forced, it is into the gap between them--between recording and production--that the pianola might be inserted. The player piano is important because the piano provides, as we have already seen, a way of thinking about tone and resonance which is tuned to the human apparatus, and because it is a device which offers to store a transcription of the human response to the world of the kind suggested by Schopenhauer.

<h1 class="sec-headA">
The Instrument with a Memory
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Let us continue with Hardy. As I suggested earlier, sound is a dubious vehicle for incarnating memory, since in the late nineteenth century it is persistently linked to entropic fade. At the same time, music is persistently linked to memory in Hardy's work--to the "storage" of impulses and their transport across personal and collective history. Hardy's poem "In a Museum" expresses this problem, comparing a fossil trace with music in the memory: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>I <br />Here's the mould of a musical bird long passed from light, <br />
Which over the earth before man came was winging; <br />
There's a contralto voice I heard last night, <br />
That lodges in me still with its sweet singing. </p>
<p>II <br />
Such a dream is Time that the coo of this ancient bird <br />
Has perished not, but is blent, or will be blending <br />
Mid visionless wilds of space with the voice that I heard, <br />
In the full-fugued song of the universe unending.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The passage here is uneasy: the fossil serves as a vehicle of a metaphor in which all sound might be recovered. It moves from individual sonic memory to sonic radiation and universal sonic survival in the manner of Babbage. But what Hardy is imagining is, I would suggest, the realm of musical storage suggested by his barrel-organ story; that is, of memory which might be carried <i>outside the human frame</i>.  </p>

<p>Another way in which the status of recorded sound is implicit in Hardy is in a series of poems about music with a memory: poems in which he evokes the instruments themselves, instruments which remember the fingering of their players and occasions they played at. In an essay entitled "Magic Rattle and Human Harp," the Weimar critic Ernst Bloch describes the progress of music from the primitive and sensual to the rational and abstract. In origin, he argues, the musical instrument is not dissociated from the music which it produces: "sound is a property of the instrument and is objectively bound to it." The primitive instrument so conceived has magical powers: it can cure the sick and drive away spirits; like the totem it speaks to its audience. Subsequently, as he puts it, music becomes formalized and "the sound climbs out of the instrument, so to speak, treating it merely as a means to an end; the musical notes break loose from the chiming bells and ringing bronze." Music replaces the "magical substance consisting of sound," creating an abstract world.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Bloch adds, "no one has ventured to 're-enchant' musical instruments." But that is something similar to what Hardy does in poems like "Haunting Fingers," subtitled "A Phantasy in a Museum of Musical Instruments." The poem dwells on the memory of the fingers which played over their surfaces: 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>And they felt past handlers clutch them, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Though none was in the room, <br />
Old players' dead fingers touch them, <br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Shrunk in the tomb.</p>

	<div class="attrib">

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">One could place alongside this a canceled stanza from Hardy's great poem on the traces of the past in objects, "Old Furniture." They follow a stanza in which dancing fingers on an "old viol" are again invoked, and here too music as language is involved. He is thinking of his father's violin: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>From each curled eff-hole the ghosts of ditties <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Incanted there by his skill in his prime <br />
Quaver in whispers the pangs and pities <br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would daily chime.</p>

	<div class="attrib">

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">In such poems on the instrument-with-a-memory, and in other fictional and autobiographical stories, Hardy imagines the ontological realm of recorded music: music detached from its producer. At times such music can seem mechanical and abstract, as it is in Conrad and to some extent in Hardy's harmoniflute story--in which the origins of the music are lost; indeed, in which it threatens to represent a commodified mass culture, like the mechanical organ which replaces the church choir in one of his stories. But elsewhere it is a kind of impersonal memory which is involved; an inscription which in some senses fulfills the promise of storage offered by the fossil bird, while also preserving the Schopenhaurian trace of the will's struggle, the language of "pangs and pities."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It is interesting in this respect to turn to Adorno, whose critiques of the culture industry are better known than his more sympathetic accounts of recorded music. In his essay "The Form of the Phonograph Record"  he argues that the phonograph record "petrifies" the actuality of the performance it records; that is, it turns it into a speaking monument or an impression like Hardy's fossilized bird. But at the same time, Adorno sees something else in this dead storage: recorded music saves the past, returning it to the status of <i>text</i>: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There is no doubt that, as music is removed by the phonograph record from the realm of live production and from the imperative of artistic activity and becomes petrified, it absorbs into itself, in this process of petrification, the very life that would otherwise vanish. The dead art rescues the ephemeral and perishing art as the only one alive. Therein may lie the phonograph record's most profound justification, which can not be impugned by any aesthetic objection to its reification. For this justification re-establishes by the very means of reification an age-old, submerged and yet warranted relationship: that between music and <i>writing</i>.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Musical notation is not what Adorno has in mind here; rather, both the actual direct transcription of sound--the trace of the needle on the record--and something fuller 

<b></b>

 and more experiential, open to constant reinterpretation. Implicitly, I think, Adorno is using the metaphor of writing to hand music back to the listener. In terms of historicity, recorded music saves the past. But in providing an indexical trace of a passage of time, a snapshot of the reified moment in which the musical text is realized and written into the medium within a specific acoustic environment, it also challenges the listener to open up the past and inhabit it as an objectified phenomena.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>   </p>

<p>If we ask "where is the stored music in Hardy?" the answer is "potentially everywhere that is human": in music which floats through occasions, which haunts, inhabits, anticipates, and echoes, structuring time for its makers and listeners. The most general version is the twanging or vibrating of "Being" itself. At the end of the description of the dying in the Walcheren marshes in <i>The Dynasts</i> Part Second, the Chorus of the Pities offers a lament. The Spirit of the Years replies (as it always does) in lofty cadences, telling the Chorus of Pities to stop recording (storing, repeating, writing down) this human music:</p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Spirit of the Years </p>
<p>Why must ye echo as mechanic mimes <br />
These mortal minions' bootless cadences, <br />
Played on the stops of their anatomy <br />
As is the mewling music on the strings <br />
Of yonder ship-masts by the unweeting wind, <br />
Or the frail tune upon this withering sedge <br />
That holds its papery blades against the gale?<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The Spirit of the Years insist that all passes away, "Whether ye sigh their sighs with them or no!" The "mechanic mime" here is the sound of a recorded music; and to open himself to this sound, the sound of human experience, is among Hardy's most fundamental aims--an aim which places him on the cusp of modernity.  </p>

Twanging Resonance
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>To illustrate more fully the way in which a Schopenhauerian understanding of music, for all its problems, might be connected to notions of pianistic inscription and memory, I turn to Wallace Stevens. Stevens is a poet whose frequent use of musical tropes owes a good deal to Schopenhauer (as, arguably, do some of his other res--crystal, clouds). The connection is acknowledged: Stevens describes reading Schopenhauer in a 1908 journal entry, and praises him over forty years later in his essay "A Collect of Philosophy" (<i>SCP</i>, 857).<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> What we see in Stevens is a movement from a focus on the musician in the earlier poetry, as in "Peter Quince at the Clavier," to a preoccupation with both what he calls the "fire" of music--music rendered visible energy--and with forms of natural music.  </p>

<p>In his earlier work in particular, Stevens often describes music in Schopenhauerian terms: music is consolation, "the voice of this besieging pain," that "By which sorrow is released, / Dismissed, absolved / In a starry placating" ("Mozart, 1935," <i>SCP</i>, 108); it is connected to pure sensation, as in "The Man with the Blue Guitar."

<p class="continued">The banging and striking, the tock of the instrument, the "buzzing" which is life might be taken as representing the will in its animal state before it climbs into abstraction. If for Schopenhauer music is connected to the unconscious, in "Notes" music is "like a sense, / A passion that we feel, not understand" (<i>SCP</i>, 339). Schopenhauer had written of the individual will as "the trembling thing that is stretched and twanged." In "Of Modern Poetry" Stevens writes that </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

<p class="continued">In "The Owl in the Sarcophagus" this is "a likeness of the earth, / That by resemblance twanged him through and through" (<i>SCP</i>, 372). This is a twanging which is adequate to existence, mediating the world "below"--the phenomenal world--and the world "above," the ideal.  </p>

<p>In this poem, and indeed throughout Stevens's mature poetry, music serves an integrative function. The fact that "Of Modern Poetry" moves from the musical re above to a resolving set of images--"a man skating, a woman dancing, a woman / Combing"--is characteristic of his use of music. Indeed the movement between the three worlds suggested by "Of Modern Poetry" suggests a tripartite scheme repeated throughout Stevens's poetry, which I would describe in these terms: natural sound, music, and the inscribed music-image which pushes us towards the ontological realm of recorded sound. It is made explicit in the three sections of "Certain Phenomena of Sound." The first section describes the cycle of natural music--"the beating of the locust's wings"--with the comment that "It is safe to sleep to a sound that time brings back." Section II describes the "slick sonata" which is musical narrative, the story of a character called Redwood Roamer, which "makes music seem / To be a nature, a place in which itself / Is that which produces everything else" (<i>SCP</i>, 256). But the third section seems to veer away into the visual, in that mysterious evocation of Semiramide, Rossini's operatic heroine, and the euphonious Eulalia, for whom naming is being--"There is no life except in the word of it."  </p>

<p>This three-part scheme responds, I think, to a temporal predicament. In nineteenth-century psychophysics, the world is in an important sense a retrospective construction, seen under the sign of loss: sundered from us by the mechanisms of perception, with their processing-speeds, reaction-times, and constrained by the limits of perception. Stevens, familiar with these ideas from William James and others, makes the point 

<b></b>

 in "A Collect of Philosophy" , as it happens in the middle of his discussion of Schopenhauer: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>According to the traditional views of sensory perception, we do not see the world immediately but only as the result of a process of seeing and after the completion of that process, that is to say, we never see the world except the moment after. Thus, we are constantly observing the past.</p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Stevens meditates in this manner for some pages, citing (from Jean Paulhan) a version of Ernst Mach's radical descriptionism: the belief that science makes, rather than reflects, a world.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Poetic perception is in this view necessarily characterized by two things: a temporal disjunction and the synthetic creation rather than the reception of an image. Thus the declaration of "An Ordinary Evening" that the leaves in the wind--and his own poem, since that is the parallel offered--are "The mobile and the immobile flickering / In the area between is and was" (<i>SCP</i>, 404). This formula suggests the space of the perceptive apparatus of the mind, the processing which turns the "is" of existence into the "was" of representation and memory. This is also, in Stevens as in Schopenhauer, a space which music structures as an interplay of expectation and fulfillment. That is to say, music is a way of understanding the process in which the past of raw experience and the present of apprehension are bound together, rhythmicized, spatialized, and stored in the mind.  </p>

<p>In describing Schopenhauer's account of perception, Stevens cites a striking metaphor from the crib he is using (Roger's <i>A Student's History of Philosophy</i>): "The will is thus far deeper seated than the intellect; it is the blind man carrying on his shoulders the lame man who can see" (<i>SCP</i>, 859). The venerable metaphor of the blind man is picked up in a poem which had, some six years before "A Collect," taken up the issue of the disjunction of perception and the "real"--"Description without Place," his 1945 Phi Beta Kappa poem at Harvard. Stevens wrote in a letter: "I am about to settle down to my subject: DESCRIPTION WITHOUT PLACE ... It seems to me to be an interesting idea: that is to say, the idea that we live in the description of a place and not the place itself, and in every vital sense we do."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  "Description without Place" has often been interpreted as signaling a break with the real, inaugurating an idealism in which poetic description is privileged over actuality; even a flight from history.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  But it seems to me that Stevens's purpose is an analysis of the problem of perception as temporally mediated. He writes of </p>

<p class="continued">This is to say that "blind" perception, or what he calls "flat appearance"--looking sundered from actuality by the processes of perception itself--might be integrated,

 knitted with retrospection into in some total vision in which the temporal deficit of perception is overcome. In section III of the poem, Stevens expands on that vision in terms which refer us both to music and light:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

To be, as on the youngest poet's page, </p>

<p>The more than human commonplace of blood, <br />
The breath that gushes upward and is gone, </p>
<p>And another breath emerging out of death, <br />

<p>There might be, too, a change immenser than  <br />
A poet's metaphors in which being would </p>
<p>Come true, a point in the fire of music where <br />
Dazzle yields to a clarity and we observe, </p>

<p class="continued">Why might "the fire of music" offer a completion of "observing"? Firstly, because music, as in Schopenhauer, carries the vital heat of being ("the will is warmth, the intellect is light"); and secondly because, in the manner depicted by Schopenhauer, it offers an image of temporal integration, a melodic totality which binds together the far of the ideal and the near of the body.  </p>

<p>In "The Owl in the Sarcophagus," Stevens's elegy for Henry Church, and therefore a poem concerned with remembrance and decay, the reintegration of perception is again red in terms of music, memory, and spatialized time. Canto 2 ostensibly describes Church,  </p>

<p class="continued">I've already noted "twanged" in this passage. Harold Bloom suggests that "Dazzle" is the key word in the canto--and indeed it repeats the "dazzle leads to clarity ... and observing is completed" of "Description without Place."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  "Dazzle" is a word which seems to describe the moment where music--signaling the temporal disconnections of perception and the integrations of memory--achieves an imagistic solidity, integrating the phenomenal and the world of mind as a presentation of being. In "The Whole Man: Perspectives, Horizons" , Stevens would write that "The principle of music would be an addition to humanity if it were not humanity itself, in other than human form" (<i>SCP,</i> 875).  </p>

Inscription and Storage
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>We can, in a final step, move these images of music back toward notions of inscription, and to the overcoming of what "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven" describes as "the wasted rations of the wastes / Of night, time and the imagination" (<i>SCP</i>, 407), a correlative of Hardy's gramophonic record of being. To be sure, it is not that easy to find technological images for music in Stevens, despite the fact that he was an avid record collector whose letters often reveal his listening habits: Schoenberg in 1935, Mahler and Berlioz a decade later. If we wanted to know what "pure" storage is for Stevens, we might turn to the "gramaphone" [<i>sic</i>] of a typically cryptic poem, "The Search for Sound Free from Motion," which "Parl-parled the West Indian weather."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  In contrast, </p>

<p class="continued">The irregular prefix shifts the instrument away from the line or trace of a stylus (<i>gramo</i>) to the letter (<i>grama</i>)--from the dynamics of sound to writing. But this instrument, at once typhoon and technology, can only repeat the weather in a phonemically hollow and empty fashion; it is the human speaker who brings those words into balance and relation, into temporal difference. One name for that difference, I would suggest, is music.  </p>

<p>Section XX of "An Ordinary Evening" describes a transcription of being imbued with human feeling:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>The imaginative transcripts were like clouds  <br />
Today; and the transcripts of feeling, impossible <br />
To distinguish. The town was a residuum, </p>
<p>A neuter shedding shapes in an absolute. <br />

And the shapes that it took in feeling ....</p>

<p class="continued">The clouds, for Schopenhauer, represent the inconsequential world of phenomena, used in Book 3 of <i>The World as Will and Idea</i> to exemplify the distinction between the contingent and the essential:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>When the clouds move, the res which they form are not essential, but indifferent to them; but that as elastic vapour they are pressed together, drifted along, spread out, or torn asunder by the force of the wind: this is their nature, the essence of the forces which objectify themselves in them, the Idea; their actual forms are only for the individual observer.</p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Clouds as stochastic phenomena are like the life of mind--a confluence of atomic theory and psychology recently explored by Daniel Tiffany; they scatter, disperse, forever change.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  If the transcripts of mind are clouds, the transcripts of feeling are also men or actors--the point of interchange between these the air which is the "bare boards" of "Notes" and "theatre floating through the clouds" of "The Auroras of Autumn" (<i>SCP</i>, 359). Or again in the late poem, "Artificial Populations," weather, the "weather's appropriate people" (an "artificial population"), and finally "music that lasts long and lives the more" (<i>SCP</i>, 474)--a triad of existence, humanity, and integration again resolved in music. </p>

<p>Stevens's late poems thus offer the hope that in music--the music of poetry--"the wasted rations" might be "Saved and beholden" (<i>SCP</i>, 407), that we might convert the noise of weather into music: "The leaves were falling like notes from a piano" (<i>SCP</i>, 242). "An Ordinary Evening" culminates in the celebration of  </p>

<p class="continued">In a final section which both evokes either end of the electromagnetic spectrum--the little reds, the "spectrum of violet" (like the "vanishing-vanished violet" of "The Own in the Sarcophagus")--and describes "A philosopher practicing scales on his piano" , what is wasted and what is saved is held in a delicate tension. The conclusion has often been depicted in terms of the buzzing new world of sub-atomic particles--of "a shade that traverses / A dust, a force that traverses a shade," as the poem's final lines describe reality--but the emphasis is on inscription, on written music rather than noise, or rather music as "noise emancipated," to borrow Benjamin's description of jazz, noise taken up into composition, with "the process of production" allowed to fall away.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> </p>

<p>The notion of inscription is further explored in the poem which follows "Notes" in <i>The Auroras of Autumn</i>, "Things of August." In "Things of August" the possibility that the buzz of existence might be saved is implicit in the "instruments" of poetry, a technology in which body and language are equated--in the sex of a spirit, or a spirit's voices: </p>

<p class="continued">Honkey-tonk "memorizing" and keeping is, I like to think, close to the player-piano in its mechanics--a suggestion I don't mean in a trivial sense, since it is at once a return and a recovery of being. The world is held still in the poem. In the late Stevens we find a poet for whom the music of existence--the natural music of the red robin, weedy wren, loud locust as much as human song--can be repeated, for whom as he puts it near the end of "Notes," "the going round / And round and round, the merely going round" is a measure of existence. And while the point about repetition is in essence a philosophical one, a point about the pleasure of the quotidian, it is also worth asking whether it also involves, as it does in Hardy, a kind of musical technology inscribed within the poem.  </p>



<div class="sec-break">
* * *
</div>	<!--CLOSE sec-break-->




<p>I began with the player piano--the instrument which stands on the brink of sonic modernity, which records sound but not "all sound," retaining its link to the world of human music-making and Helmholtz's depicting sonic reception in terms of music and the piano. With Schopenhauer's description of music as the transcript of the temporal struggle of the will in mind, I considered what I called the "instrument with a memory" in Hardy, the music of being. Finally, I looked at the binding function of music in Stevens, its ability to integrate a world in which perception is afflicted with a splintered temporality, and at the notion of an inscription of natural music. In such cases, the dream that entropy may be overcome is sustained via notions of resonance 

<b></b>

 and storage which draws us towards the notion of recorded music--the story whose first stop is the player piano, the instrument with a memory. </p>

<p>This is, of course, rather different from the flat storage offered by the gramophone, which, to be sure, seems to offer in its inscription of sound into the groove a fuller realization of Stevens's title "The Search for Sound Free from Motion"--Kahn's phrase was "holding the time of sound still." But none of the authors I have considered wishes to evacuate the human producer or listener, the twanging resonator, from the circuit; which is to say that they conceive of sonic storage within what is at once a psychology of memory and a technopoesis, rather than an independent technology. The passage from Stevens's "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction" that I cited at the beginning, about "Swiss perfection" and "not balances / That we achieve but balances that happen" is, I think, ultimately a description of a kind of serio-comic surrender to the machinery.  </p>

<p>Readers may have detected a muted critique of the technological determinism and historical isolationism running through the work of Kittler, Kahn, and other media theorists--muted because I think there is much of interest in their work and its reconceptualization of writing as media. But Kittler's final dream often appears to be that of machine talking to machine; indeed, the systems theorist Niklas Luhman goes so far as to claim that human beings do not communicate, only communication systems communicate--a version of the behaviorist critique of the "inner man" explaining the workings of the mind.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Despite the persuasiveness of this at the level of the system, the indifference of such thinking to the origins of any message in human beings suggests an evacuation of experience to which neither Helmholtz, the great materialist himself, nor these two poets would have subscribed. For both, music is already a technology for the storage of experience, prior to the gramophone, offering the possibility that being might be formalized. "These sounds are long in the living of the ear" writes Stevens; and for the poetic tradition he perpetuates, it is the life which his lines carry. </p>

1. Introduction
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p id="lead">
Well before publication it was apparent that Ezra Pound's greatest poetic achievement, <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, was preoccupied with memory. When Pound's wife Dorothy received his first messy typescripts, she wrote back in surprise that the new Cantos, rather than treating historical concerns like the previous ones, "are your self, the memories that make up yr. person."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Her comment provides an essential entry into a poem that, produced in the aftermath of a breakdown, dramatizes the resurrection of a self--so much so that one is tempted to approach <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> in the light of a heartbreaking outburst in Barry Levinson's 1999 film, "Liberty Heights," in which Levinson's alter ego--a younger brother and aspiring writer--concludes his account of adolescence in Baltimore with the remark that if he had realized so much of the world he grew up in would disappear, he would have tried harder to commit the whole of it to memory. </p>

<p>But Pound's wartime suite amounts to more than a private reminiscence, and the philosophical, historical, and ideological dimensions of memory in his meditation have only slowly come into focus. As concerns philosophy, Pound for more than ten years before the war had prepared himself to create in the last third of his projected hundred Cantos "un cielo sereno e filosofico" ("a serene philosophical heaven")--a Paradise based on the state of being implied by the highest flights of the mind.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  This project was 

<b></b>

 to be based largely on the neoplatonic implications of Cavalcanti's canzone "Donna mi prega" ("Because a Lady Asks Me")--a poem that treats the way affection prepares a place in the memory for images of beauty to reside, and celebrates the ability of those images to conjure up the intellectual form of Love and join the soul to universal intellect.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  (The special place of memory in the mind's quest for reunion with the forms of the divine had in Pound's view been theorized by the neoAristotelian tradition of Avicenna, which Pound believed had supplied Cavalcanti the key intellectual premises of his poetic disquisition, and which assigned an even more important place in cognition to memory than had Aristotle himself.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> ) </p>

<p>In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Pound seized on a handful of key phrases in "Donna mi prega" and used them to explore similar philosophical notions in Scotus Erigena and elsewhere.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Again and again in these notes he includes reference to Cavalcanti's "formato locho," which Pound translates in Canto 36 as the "formed trace" of the beloved which Love carves "dove sta memoria"--"where memory liveth" (C36/178, 177).<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  And when he produced the first fragments of his Paradiso in the early 1940s he built them around citations from Cavalcanti, Erigena, and Confucius.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  This constellation of material would have provided the core of the last section of the Cantos had Pound's situation not deteriorated during the Second World War. As Pound said at the time "if it weren't for this tiresome war," there would be time to consider whether Western thought had progressed or declined since the Middle Ages, and to ask questions such as, "Have we got better at thinkin'? Do we think with greater clarity? Or has the so-called program of science merely got us all cluttered up mentally and pitched us into greater confusion?"<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Relentlessly, though, wartime conditions in northern Italy did interrupt Pound's philosophical endeavors and turned his attention to the precariousness of another kind of thought--communal associations anchored by the monuments of Italian culture that Allied air raids in 1943 and 1944 were progressively ruining. As this destruction forced Pound back upon the cords of his personal memory frayed by the stresses of the war, he responded to the great theme of Italian Fascist propaganda in the latter stages of the war--that the Allies were engaged in a campaign of calculated cultural terrorism, attempting what a recent book by Robert Bevan has called "The Destruction of Memory." Allied bombing, in this view, was aimed not only at the demolition of the Axis's military and industrial structure, but also at what Bevan describes as an "enforced forgetting" linked to the premeditated destruction of architectural traditions whose aim is "the erasure of the memories, history and identity attached to architecture and place."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The effect on Pound of the Allied conduct of the war involved both rage and paralysis, resulting from being a compatriot of the bombers who were obliterating the material culture he had cherished for forty years. The by-product was a sharpened sensitivity to what historians lately have begun to call the phenomenon of "social" or "cultural memory"--that is, to the power of material images, including public monuments and especially including the monumental sites of ritual re-enactments, to "impose interpretations of the past ... shape memory and thus to construct social identity."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  <i>The Pisan </i>

<b></b>

 <i>Cantos</i>, I want to suggest, grew out of key late statements of Italian Fascist cultural propaganda and came to construct a theory of cultural memory that identified Italy with visual sophistication and the Allied powers with those bursts of iconoclasm that Robert Bevan reminds us were entailed in an "ancient pattern" of sacred destruction from "Byzantium's Quarrel of the Images to the Reformation and beyond" (DM, 17). In harmony with the more extreme elements of Italian Fascism, though, Pound took this argument to its anti-Semitic limit and traced the origins of Allied iconoclasm to the sanctions against graven images in the Old Testament. In poems leading up to <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, he elaborated this reaction into a defence of an Italian "arte monda," or clean art, associated with the decimated cultural patrimony of Italy and opposed to the modern world's absorption of art into the ideologies of the marketplace and the religious fanatic. Growing out of these nightmares, <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> became a poem devoted to shoring up a collective memory not only of the monuments that the Allies had so lamentably defaced but of an Italian culture rooted in antiquity and revitalized by Mussolini. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">

<p>Once the Second World War started, Pound, his English wife Dorothy, and his American parents--aliens in Axis territory--were stranded in the English watering hole of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, and cut off from their income in England and America. Like George Bernard Shaw and Winston Churchill, Pound had been an early supporter of Mussolini. Unlike them, he maintained his support for the Italian regime after its invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and then again after it notoriously introduced racial laws against the Jews in 1938.  </p>

<p>When, therefore, the opportunity arose to be paid for broadcasting his views on the way Allied propaganda had distorted the history of Fascism over the Italian radio, Pound did not hesitate. It was for this that on July 26 1943--the day after Mussolini was deposed in Rome--the American government indicted Pound for treason for having given aid and comfort to the enemy. Determined to continue his broadcasting even then, Pound found himself in a studio in Rome in the tumultuous days after September 8 1943, when Badoglio surrendered Rome to the Allies, prompting the Germans to seize it on their own and greatly increasing the danger principally to the Jews of Rome (many of whom were exterminated before the end of the year) but also to resident foreigners. </p>

<p>Fleeing for his life, Pound made his way through the chaos to the north of Italy, making contact with men who would become key members of the new Salo Republic, which the Germans created after springing Mussolini from a mountain confinement. The result was that for the rest of the war Pound became one of very few foreign intellectuals advising the remnants of Mussolini's cultural establishment--an effort that more and more bizarrely amount to his pressing on them the translations into Italian of Confucius that he was simultaneously incorporating into his poetry and his prose.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Finally and decisively, the run of composition that leads directly to <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> was triggered by the shock of the 1943-44 Allied bombardment of Italy and by a brief moment of elation late in 1944, when it seemed that the Italians and Germans had reversed the Allied progress. During the winter of 1943 and then intermittently in the summer and fall of 1944 even the sleepy town of Rapallo was damaged by air raids that were aimed at anti-aircraft installations on the Ligurian coast and at the port city of Genoa. And after Florence fell in September 1944, the Allied bombing of northern Italy only increased, as Rimini and Forli on the so-called Gothic Line continued to be sites of heavy ting and the fate of Bologna hung in the balance. Exhausted by this effort, at the end of 1944 the Allies reined in their efforts for the winter. Though they managed to take Ravenna on December 5 after many days of ting, Bologna remained in Axis hands until the following year. Meanwhile, in Europe above the Alps the Battle of the Bulge was raging, allowing a last desperate hope in Fascist Italy that the Allied invasion of Europe might be turned back. </p>

<p>In the midst of these developments, Mussolini's Ministry of Popular Culture launched a campaign to win back ordinary Italians to Fascism by reminding them of how much of Italy's cultural patrimony was being damaged by apparently senseless Allied bombing. That part of the Italian press still under Fascist sway took up the regime's cause enthusiastically. Mario Rivoire, for example, was appointed editor of the <i>Il Secolo XIX</i> of Genoa just after September 1943 as part of what Lawrence Rainey has called "the [Salo] government's effort to control the press by placing trusted supporters in key positions"--an effort that relentlessly stressed the destruction of cultural monuments "wrought by the 'terrorist bombers' of the English and Americans." One of <i>Il Secolo</i>'s recurrent features carried a headline variation on the rubric "I monumenti che il nemico ci distrugge" ("The Monuments the Enemy is Destroying"). Thus on Sunday, June 4 1944, the paper published an article relating the damage that Allied bombing visited during late 1943 and early 1944 on the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini. And though this particular article concentrated on the historical importance of the Tempio rather than the extent of its destruction and produced pictures only of the building before its damage, Pound, who had in large part established his reputation as an epic poet upon an identification with the building, saved the piece, and the faded clipping still resonates with his shock.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This, however, was only one of many shocks that the Fascist press relayed that season, not only in <i>Il Secolo XIX</i> but in the other newspapers Pound read, including the anti-Semite Farinacci's <i>Regime Fascista</i>, and the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> of Milan (<i>PIF</i>, 197-98).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The <i>Corriere</i>, the most important newspaper still under Fascist sway, in late 1944 echoed <i>Il Secolo</i>'s "Monumenti" articles with its own series about the destruction of Italy's artistic patrimony under the general rubric "L'Italia Artistica Mutilata." </p>

<p>On Monday, September 4 1944, Genoa and Rapallo were bombed, weakening Renaissance arches in Rapallo and degrading the city's supply of drinking water. Ten days later Pound, who had been displaced by the Axis military in May from his apartment in Rapallo and forced with his wife to move into the residence of his mistress, Olga Rudge, situated on a hill path above the city in San Ambrogio, wrote to Fernando 

<b></b>

 Mezzasoma, the Salo Republic's Minister of Popular Culture, to advise on the situation. In the letter he refers to himself as a "sfollata," an "evacuee."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> </p>

<p>Also on September 4, the <i>Corriere</i> announced the destruction of another of Pound's sacred places, this time the brilliant mosaic chamber outside Ravenna commonly known as the mausoleum of the Empress Aelia Galla Placidia. The <i>Corriere</i> said Ravenna had suffered multiple attacks, and that almost all the great public buildings of the city that had once been capitol of the Byzantine Exarchate had been badly damaged--the Cathedral and the churches of San Francesco, San Domenico, San Giovanni Battista, San Vittore, and San Simeon (p.1). </p>

<p>As part of its propaganda campaign, the <i>Corriere</i> also featured a running feature entitled "Sangue Italiano" ("Italian Blood"), whose aim was to praise Italy's citizen heroes. On October 1, for example, under the headline "Sangue Italiano: L'eroina di Rimini" ("The Heroine of Rimini"), the paper told the stirring but apparently fabricated story of an "anonymous, radiant heroine from Rimini," who, having been "raped by two Australians," deliberately led a group of Canadian soldiers into a mine-field and, dying, announced, "Ho vendicato il mio onore"--"I have vindicated my honor" (<i>EPMC</i>, 244-45). And on Monday, November 20 1944, under the same rubric another account of patriotic sacrifice recounted battles around the city of Forli (not far from Rimini in the direction of Bologna). Below headline stories that triumphed Mussolini's "fede nella riscossa della Patria" ("faith in the resurgence of the Fatherland") and quoted the promise of one of Mussolini's officials that "ritorneremo"--"we Italians shall return"--the paper's third lead for that day told the story of "Sangue Romagnolo" ("Blood of the Romagna") in the form of a story (possibly also fabricated and certainly intended to remind its readers of "Il libro cuore" of Edmondo De Amicis) of anonymous women who put their lives on the line at Forli's gate by shielding Fascist snipers and obstructing the entrance of Allied troops, thus becoming "voluntarie della morte" ("volunteers for death") in Mussolini's cause (p.1). (<a href="#1"> 1</a>.) </p>

<p>The sadness and resolve of these articles had a dramatic effect on Pound's wavering equanimity, but what finally shattered his silence were three articles that appeared in the <i>Corriere della Sera</i>'s Sunday editions of December 3 and December 17 1944. On December 3, the <i>Corriere</i> (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) rehearsed the matter of the "L'Italia Artistica Mutilata" under the sub-head, "La calata degli iconoclasti" ("The Descent of the Iconoclasts"). This article proffered shocking pictures of how much damage Allied bombing had inflicted on the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan and the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini. The latter picture was captioned: "Solo uomini che odiano l'arte potevano ridurre in questo stato un capolavoro come il tempio malatestiano di Rimini" ("Only those who hate art could have reduced to such a state a masterpiece like the Tempio Malatestiano of Rimini").  </p>

<p>"La Calata degli iconoclasti" begins with the leader, "Dai monumenti sacri e profani ai capolavori della pittura, della scultura e dell'arte decorativa, il catalogo delle distruzioni e interminabile: ancora una volta il nembo della barbarie si e abbattuto sulla terra che custodisce le vestigia e il fuoco delle piu nobili civilta" ("From sacred and profane monuments to masterpieces of painting, sculpture and the decorative arts, the 

<b></b>

 catalogue of destruction is endless: once more the barbarian storm has descended on ground that tends the traces and the spirit of the highest civilizations"). Then, noting the recent rebombing of Genoa, it relates ruin in Turin, Milan (where the church of Santa Maria della Grazie was severely damaged and the Last Supper of Leonardo was almost lost), Bologna, Cagliari, and Naples; also, recounted in great detail, in smaller cities around the country, including Rimini ("con i suoi trenta edifici monumentali infranti, segnatamente con il rovinatissimo tempio Malatestiano, fulgida espressione del nostro Rinascimento ... nel quale sono andati distrutti un affresco del Battaglini, </p><!--_re 1-->

 for months," dwelling at length on the losses in the Romagna and noting that the great churches of Ravenna had been reduced to a pile of ruins, including the cloister of San Vitale and "all of the famous churches of the Exarcate"--"l'Esarcato." </p>

<p>Yet, the <i>Corriere</i> consoled its readers, some things had been spared and, while Ravenna and Bologna resisted, Fascist Italy was not yet lost. Crucially, the paper focused its account of Italian identity around Fascism's reconsolidation of the work of Dante, who, it said, fostered "the resurrection of the nation" and was buried in the Ravennese "fragrant pine wood" immortalized in <i>Purgatorio</i> XXVIII:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>La battaglia rugge sulla soglia della dolce pineta<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  aromatica, il suo rombo incessante ha troncato da tempo il silenzio reverenziale creato intorno alla tomba di Dante. E mai come in questi giorni alla tomba di Dante si rivolge il pensiero degli Italiani, non tanto per il pericolo che sovrasta alle ossa del divino annunciatore medievale della resurrezione della Patria ... quanto per trarne la fede e l'auspicio che "l'aiuola che ci fa tanto feroci"<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  pacificata riprenda nel mondo il posto che il nostro tempo le aveva conquistato.</p>

<p>
	(The battle rages around the edge of the soft fragrant pine wood; its incessant roaring has broken the reverential silence around the tomb of Dante. And never as in these last days has the thought of all Italians turned to the tomb of Dante, not only because of the danger that continues to hang over the remains of the divine prophet of the resurrection of the nation ... but also so that we may receive faith and good omen that "the little threshing floor that makes us so fierce" will, pacified, again take up the place in the world that our time [meaning the age of Fascism] has won back for it.)
</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Especially suited to get under the skin of readers like Pound who had been persuaded by the Fascists that the war was a result of betrayal by European Jewish finance, the article lamented that Italy's losses were as much the fault of international finance as Allied bombing. As the <i>Corriere</i>'s writer, Gino Damerini, asserted, even if Italy's remaining treasures were to escape the chaos of battle, "al seguito dell'invasione agisce una folla di intressi che mira ad impossessarsi delle nostre ricchezze artistiche" ("in the wake of the invasion a crowd of special interests has taken aim at our artistic heritage"). Financial speculation and inflation, he averred, have put into place an art market that will spirit away what has not been destroyed unless Italians respond to "il dovere di resistere, almeno di reagir, agli allettamenti della moneta rapinatrice, rifiutandosi ad un commercio vietato dalle leggi, di cui proprio essi, soltanto essi, porteranno la responsabilita e, diciamolo pure, il disonore" ("the duty to resist, or at least to react to the allurements of plundering finance, refusing a commerce forbidden by law and of which they, and they alone, will carry the responsibility and, we must say it, the dishonor"). In any case, he lamented, "le distruzione dei segni della nostra secolare supremazia civile saranno ricordate, sempre, come prove della barbarie altrui: la storia di tutte le epoche insegna" ("the destruction of the traces of our secular civic supremacy will be remembered, always, as proof of the barbarism of others: the history of every epoch teaches the same lesson"). </p>

<p>Finally, the same issue of the <i>Corriere</i> announced the death of the Futurist Tomasso Marinetti, who had been a volunteer in Mussolini's Imperial campaign in Africa and 

<b></b>

 had more recently served on the Russian front, where he conducted himself like a professional soldier, careless of the by now precarious condition of his health. This was consistent, the managing editor of the <i>Corriere</i> noted, with his behavior after September 8 1943, when he was among the first to draw around Mussolini, "a cui rimase fedele in ogni circostanza" ("to whom he remained faithful in every circumstance") (p.3). </p>

<p>Two weeks after these horrific stories, the news took a dramatic turn for the better from the Fascist perspective. At 11 o'clock on December 16, Pound listened on the radio as Mussolini, making what was to be his last major public speech from the teatro Lirico in Milan, called on Italians to take heart from the Allied difficulties in the Marches and farther north in Belgium and mount a counteroffensive ("riscossa") to take back their native land.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The next day the Sunday <i>Corriere della Sera</i> provided a full text of the speech under the headline "Da Milano E' Squillata La Diana della Riscossa" ("from Milan sounds the reveille for a counterattack") (p.1). </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">

<p>These stories in the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> of November and December 1944, combined with the unexpected hope for the Mussolini government fomented by the hiatus in the Allies' advances in winter 1944, kick-started Pound's work on new Cantos and triggered four months of almost continuous composition in Italian, beginning on or soon after December 3 and continuing until April 1945. The Italian propaganda campaign could not help but play on the shame Pound felt as a countryman of the bombardiers who were destroying so much of Italy's cultural heritage, and seems to have solidified his conclusion that the war was being fought between two different mentalilities--a civilized culture of religion and art and a barbaric culture of iconoclasm. </p>

<p>Pound's Italian composition, moreover, would prove more than a wartime oddity, since he proceeded to incorporate not only fragments of it but its ideological framework into <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> that he began to compose in July 1945. In both phases of his work, Pound follows the <i>Corriere</i>'s attempts to preserve the memory of all that had been recently lost, thus demonstrating that imagination and memory are not passive activities but forces imbued with philosophical and practical wisdom. Especially in the Italian verses he enacts this aim by means of a dialogue with ghosts--a collective invocation of a series of great souls whose sparks counter the random destruction of the Italian culturescape.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Within a month of the <i>Corriere</i>'s "Calata degli iconoclasti" article and two weeks after the newspaper's reporting of Mussolini's call for a "riscossa," Pound had finished two poems reflecting Mussolini's call to action that that were eventually to take their place as Cantos 72 and 73 of the published <i>Cantos</i>.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In them Pound allowed the deceased Marinetti to speak for himself, but as the voice of Fascist resistance in Florence and in Mussolini's provincial home, the Romagna, he presented not Mussolini himself but two historical analogues. In Canto 72, which records that "Rimini arsa e Forli distrutta" (C72/428: "Rimini is burned, Forli is in ruins") and which suggests the ruin of Ravenna in the disturbed sleep of Galla Placidia, the primary spokesman is Ezzelino da Romano, 

<b></b>

 for thirty-four years the Ghibelline Lord of the March of Treviso and a re in <i>Inferno</i> XII. At Canto 72/427 it is Ezzolino who repeats the government's pledge, "torneremo"--"we will return." In Canto 73 on the other hand, it is the Florentine aristocratic poet Guido Cavalcanti who announces Mussolini's "diana / della riscossa" (C73/438) and who retells with admiration and at length the <i>Corriere</i>'s story of the heroines of Rimini.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Buoyant with his progress, Pound then extended his composition in Italian to an expansive suite that, like the "Sangue Italiano" articles on heroic Italian citizens in the <i>Corriere</i>, was meant to furnish avatars of love and courage. In Pound's Italian they are presented as burning embers to revive the flame of the high civilization ("il fuoco delle piu nobili civilta") whose shining achievements ("[le] fulgid[e] espression[i] del nostro Rinascimento"), the <i>Corriere</i> reported, had so recently disappeared. And so not only Cantos 72 and 73 but these subsequent and until now unpublished poems in Italian draw on the accounts in the <i>Corriere della Sera</i>'s winter 1944 accounts of the mutilation of Italian culture and amplify the defiance expressed in the actions of the citizen heroes and heroines of Rimini and Forli. </p>

<p>The deepest subject of the new Italian Cantos, however, affirms art's power to preserve in a paradise of memory the ruined monuments of Italy that the <i>Corriere</i>, with specific reference to the Fascist revival, had called "segni della nostra secolare supremazia civile [che] saranno ricordate, sempre, come prove della barbarie altrui: la storia di tutte le epoche insegna" ("traces of our secular civic supremacy [that] will be remembered, always, as proof of the barbarism of others: the history of every epoch teaches the same lesson"). This underlying theme begins in a quiet moment of Canto 72, where the spirit of Galla Placidia recalls the music of the past amid that part of the pine forest of Ravenna that the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> maintained was still intact and close to the yet unbroken tomb of Dante and the tomb of Placidia herself, lying in ruins nearby. Then in fragments written immediately after Cantos 72 and 73, Pound creates an analogue for Galla Placidia in the form of a young girl--a refugee or "sfollata" of the kind he himself had become in Rome and in Rapallo. Envisioned on the hillpath ("salita") above Rapallo, she is addressed by Pound as "la scalza" ("the barefooted one") and she speaks of herself as a wandering Madonna, displaced from a destroyed icon of "l'Assunta" ("the risen Virgin") in one of the bombed churches in the area. (Recall the <i>Corriere</i>'s note about the destroyed "l'Assunta" of Frangipane at Rimini.)  </p>

<p>It is possible to piece together the structure of Pound's Italian sequence, (which was never completed but extended to dozens of pages of rough typescript drafts and semi-finished typescripts of two poems labeled Canto 74 and 75), not merely from the internal coherence of the drafts that survive in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale, but from several schemas that Pound inscribed on them.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The most authoritative of these schemas runs as follows:

<p>Pound here sketches out a movement that begins with his own visionary encounters on the "Salita" of Rapallo--first with "la scalza" from his earlier fragment ("la sfollata," the evacuee)--and then with the Renaissance poet Basinio of Parma, whom Pound encounters on the ancient Via Aurelia in Liguria in the company of his patron Sigismondo Malatesta on the way to finalize a treaty. Basinio recounts to Pound a fading vision of the great thirteenth-century beauty, Ezzelino da Romano's sister, "Cunizza." </p>

<p>The draft sequence then shifts to two great outbursts of defiance--Sigismondo Malatesta's blast against the corruptions of the modern world (modeled after Sordello's rage in <i>Purgatorio</i> VI) and a recall of Caterina Sforza's ringing statement of contempt for her captors on the walls of Forli. Malatesta, who had been lord of Rimini, a legendary patron of the arts and a fierce scourge of Papal Rome, is included to give historical resonance to the Axis defenders of Rimini. And Caterina Sforza, the great Renaissance virago and ruler of Forli, epitomizes the heroic women at the gate of Forli. To rebels who were holding her children for ransom to ensure that she would help them take over her city, Caterina, according to Guicciardini, safely on the walls of a nearby fort, "lifted her skirt and exclaimed defiantly, 'Don't you think, you fools, that I have the stuff to make others?'"<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  (On another occasion, rather than surrender to Cesare Borgia, she attempted to blow the powder magazine under her own castle aerie--"il Paradiso.")  </p>

<p>From there Pound's drafts rise out of the hell of war and return to the young waif on the hillside, this time in the guise of "l'Assunta," and continues with a Landoresque imaginary dialogue between Scotus "Erigena" and Dante. Finally Pound ends with an ambiguous Lotus-like "Eliseo" ("Elysium") and an equally ambiguous limbo populated first by the emperor Hadrian and then by (a re identified in other versions of the schema) Lorenzo de' Medici.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The double climax of Pound's Paradisal theme occurs in draft tableaux entitled "Assunta" and "Eliseo." Pound's "Assunta," like his Galla Placidia, is inextricably linked to an icon, both in the sense of an image of a sacred object (in this case, a damaged "Assumption" on a ruined church wall) and in the Aristotelian (and later scholastic) sense of a thing that is an aid to memory.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  As such, these drafts strongly anticipate Canto 74 of the published <i>Pisan Cantos</i>, which, invoking the phrase "formato loco" from Cavalcanti 

<b></b>

 in "Donna mi prega," testifies to the resurgent power of such "EIKONE " to recall us to the form of the divine. In Canto 74, as Pound draws near to the first climax of his suite, he tells us that "funge la purezza"--"purity functions"--because  </p>

<p class="continued">Pound's Italian "Assunta" and "Eliseo" drafts anticipate this passage by making not only negative reference to "la calata degli iconoclasti" as in the 1944 <i>Corriere</i> but positive reference to the mnemonic value of iconic images in philosophy since Aristotle. Even in Aristotle's <i>De Anima</i> ("On the Soul," which Pound studied in the 1940s) and its related text, <i>On Memory and Recollection</i>, all human thought and imagination are said to depend on the memory of the sensible image ("phantasma"), which becomes the soul's source of intelligible form 
<img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek01.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="39" height="17" />

.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Thus the soul receives "the form <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek01.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="39" height="17" /> of sensible objects without the matter <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek02.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="41" height="16" />, just as the wax receives the impression of the signet-ring without the iron or the gold"; and subsequently "all things which are imaginable are necessarily objects of memory."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  However, as Aristotle adds in <i>On Memory and Recollection</i>, in recollection a mental object is not merely "phantasma" but also, "insofar as we consider it in relation to something else, a 'likeness' <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek03.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="46" height="16" /> that serves as an 'aid to memory,'" and that it is "the affection <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek04.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="47" height="17" /> which is produced by sensation in the soul" that corresponds to the "lasting state ... we call memory."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  In this way "EIKONE " serve to recharge our affection for the source, and motivate us to reanimate it. </p>

<p>Adapting this definition of mental process, Pound's Italian "Assunta" and "Eliseo" drafts both ally the material reality of a graphic icon with the attainment of truth and translate Aristotle's psychological account into cultural terms. As Pound puts it in a 1944 essay, "A Visiting Card," "Tradition <i>inheres</i> ... in the images of the gods [elsewhere in the essay he calls these images "mnemonic and commemorative symbols"], and gets lost in dogmatic definitions. History is recorded in monuments, and <i>that</i> is why they get destroyed."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In other words, the cultural memory embodied in European monuments works hand in hand with individual memory to resist the course of social disintegration. </p>

<p>Especially in "Assunta," moreover, Pound insists that insofar as the "mnemonic" power of EIKONE  depends on their status as images, image-centered art resists iconclasm's tendency toward abstraction and meretriciousness--an impulse that Pound tendentiously associates during the war with the West's Semitic heritage and with Jews. So "Assunta" begins by asserting, "mai coi codini sara l'arte monda" ("there will never be clean art among the fanatics"), where "monda" signifies not "of the world" but an adjective, "pure" (from "mondare," to remove impurity), and where "i codini" ("the fanatics") invokes Pound's hostility to Semitic and Protestant resistance to religious images and to their creation of a disembodied and intellectualized religion and its associated fanaticism and repression.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The "abstracter superstitions" of this fanaticism, 

<b></b>

 he maintains elsewhere, are consistent with the way Jewish, Protestant, and Puritan traditions involve the "destruction of symbols" through the "prohibition of 'graven images'"; whereas only concrete images, in his view, can provide a bulwark against an "abstract and generic" mode of thought.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In what can only be called the anti-Semitic extremity of these views (which ignore on the one hand age-old Jewish traditions of Kaballistic iconography and on the other hand the danger of idolatry, in which images are allowed unqualified hegemony in intellectual discourse), clean art is everywhere threatened by the forces of usury and abstract analysis in a world dominated by the bombardier's destructiveness and by the invidious "iconoclasm" of what the <i>Corriere</i> called "plundering finance." And so, in his explicitly Fascist history of Western culture, Pound frames the struggle of Mussolini's Italy during the war as a contest not only against Allied barbarism but also against those cultural inclinations of the modern West that, in alliance with Jewish finance, would (in the words of another line in the Italian drafts) "distruggere i simboli del bel pensiero"--"destroy the 'symbols' of authentically creative thought."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The climax of Pound's Fascist Paradise occurs in the draft of an "Eliseo" ("Elysium") that invokes res of deceased lovers who are said, after "Donna mi prega," to be "formati"--that is, to have produced a "formato locho"--a "formed trace"--in the memory. Pound's language here is exceedingly odd, not just in its Italian expression but in its account of the relations between life and death. I quote from near the end of the poem: </p>

<p>Here, in the midst of an advancing host of the dead falling in April 1945 like snowflakes, newly spilt blood takes the lead--"il sangue sparso fa il conducente"--but Pound counsels his readers: "non cercate qui i nuovi ([i] vostri) morti / non son formati ancora"--"don't seek here for your own recently dead; they are not formed yet"--with the implication that only when the kiln of memory has shaped the dead into resonant images can they take their place with the muses of antiquity and inspire our faith in the future. Note also that the beloved dead call out here: "Qui sono"--"here we are," with the sense of "we are still here, the best parts of yourself, remaining to help you rebuild your life." And though in a belated afterthought the poem worries that their voices may be only siren songs, tempting Odysseus to return to the good old days, the draft ends on the note of "serenity" amid "slaughter" with an allusion to a line of Pound's "Homage to Sextus Propertius," which holds out hope for a living immortality, an "at[t]imo del gran respire" ("moment of the great breath").<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, then, in the formal opening that Pound appended to his "Eliseo," the "morti formati" are named as true muses. Their private histories remain (as in Cavalcanti) accidentals, but the love they inspire has become a site of illumination and the song they sing is strong enough to attract the sun and his fleet of planets to the plains of Italy. The following passage seems to be the last that Pound worked on before the war ended: </p>

<p>With his long-meditated "Eliseo" still unfinished, on 1 May 1945 Pound found himself without warning abducted in Sant' Ambrogio by Italian partisans aware of his Fascist connections. Unexpectedly released, he then surrendered himself to the custody of the American army, whereupon the FBI interrogated him for several weeks in Genoa. Finally he was dispatched to solitary confinement in a small wire pen with a cement base (he called it "the gorilla cage") in the U.S. Army Disciplinary Training Center outside Pisa, to be held there until the U.S. government saw fit to proceed with a trial for treason. The Center harbored some soldiers turned real criminals, among them rapists and murderers. But the camp was also a rehabilitation center for soldiers convicted of lesser crimes, who were later returned to combat.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Pound remained there, just short of 60, for three weeks under a relentless sun alternating with the pelting rain and evening dampness of an Italian summer, eventually suffering symptoms that included "violent and hysterical terror," "claustrophobia," "confusion," and a temporary but "complete loss of memory"--signs that the camp doctors feared might be "premonitory" of a mental breakdown.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  (Later he told a psychiatrist that he felt "as thought the upper third of [his] brain were missing" and again that "[my] mainspring [had been] busted."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> ) </p>

<p>Because of his distress, around 1 July Pound was transferred to a tent in the camp's medical compound, where he was technically still forbidden to speak to fellow inmates but where he was allowed writing implements. At that point, the recent Italian drafts in his head but his identity wavering, he began once more to compose, this time in English. In Peter Makin's words, the substance "of the Pisan Cantos is, first, a simply cry of pain and, second, a naming--over of what has been known, sorrowing over the lost, and trying to find, in what is left, some hope-worthy meaning and reason to go on" (<i>PC</i>, 239). And so at the end of the first of the new poems, Canto 74, though Pound continues to draw on the technical account of memory in Aristotle and in "Donna mi prega," his utterance has taken on the urgency of a man saved at the last moment from drowning. Attributing his salvation to the power of memory, he depicts himself

<p>In this passage, "liquid" signifies a <i>form</i> associated first with the perception and the memory of the inexhaustible sea, then with the image of Aphrodite who rises out of it (in, for example, Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus"), and finally with an intelligible concept of Love itself--a neoplatonic vision of the unity of things in which we are "suddenly conscious of the reality of the <i>nous</i>, of mind, apart from any man's individual mind, of the sea crystalline and enduring, of the bright as it were molten glass that envelops us, full of light."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Having thus linked memory with the power of the forms it is invested in, Pound concludes that memory must be not simply an "accidental" quality of the mind, but an essential property of it, as Aristotle distinguishes accident from property in his "Topics." "A property," Aristotle holds, is "a predicate which does not indicate the essence of a thing, but yet belongs to that thing alone ... thus it is a property of man to be capable of learning grammar, for if A be a man, then he is capable of learning grammar, and if he be capable of learning grammar, he is a man." "An accident" on the other hand is "something which may possibly either belong or not belong to any one ... thing, as ... 'whiteness,' for there is nothing to prevent the same thing being at one time white, and at another not white." "Accident," Aristotle adds, is etymologically related to "what happens (<i>accidit</i>) to be true of [something]."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, then, as contemporary reviewers of <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> noticed, the salvific workings of memory help shape the suite's revolutionary poetic techniques--techniques that subsequently set a standard of poetic immediacy and influenced the most important poetry in the English language for the rest of the century. Pound acknowledges these revolutionary procedures in Canto 81, when he writes that to "break the pentameter that was the first heave" (C81/538) and more bluntly in a rude note to his publisher. Pound thought that his friend James Laughlin was paying too much attention to conventional page layout when he was preparing <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> for press in 1946 and admonished him: "God damn &amp; buggar the punctuation--the important thing is for the 1<sup>st</sup> time to emphasize the articulation of the thought."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  In <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, that is, the work of recollection radically refashions grammar, rhythm, and lineation to render its intuitive forays and consolidations. Consider a short passage from Pound's Canto 74, which begins and ends taking note of a just-finished rain:

<p>Here, the sight of butterflies and the smell of mint sharpen Pound's imagination, causing his memory to associate the sparrows he notices with "Lesbia's sparrows" in Catullus IV and by implication with the goddess of love, Venus. In the scene in front of him, though, these small beauties are nearly overwhelmed by the stark reality of the camp, in which prisoners forbidden to speak occupy themselves with the sound of drumming and see only banners and guard towers (the latter just softened because Pound can perceive in them the shape of Chinese ideograms). The oppressiveness of all this drives Pound (shifting now to his adopted Italian) back into the past, where he remembers a rainy trip in Southern France, to Ussel and Ventadour. When, however, Pound recognizes that even his memory has been obstructed, the bleakness of his present situation begins to overshadow his recollection, and emblematically the gracious re of a French salesman whose name Pound is unable to recall answers a simple request with words of portentous sadness: "'No that is impossible.'" Frighteningly, Pound realizes that he has also forgotten the name of the city where this took place, and where he saw the primitive cave paintings; and the pain of his loss echoes in his disappointed statement that the paintings were less striking to his youthful incomprehension than postcards of them--a deficiency whose melancholy mirrors Pound's present confusion and seems as irremediable as his confinement. Apparently, neither in the future nor in memory is he likely to revisit "those old roads" again.  </p>

<p>Then, inexplicably and magically, he recollects the precious name of the keeper of the inn he was then staying in, and the force of this recovery (caught in a syntax that simultaneously and deliberately deploys her name both as something remembered and a call to her presence--"Mme Pujol"!) enters the inspiriting "smell of mint under the tent flaps / especially after the rain." It is in such quotidian scenes that Pound stages the renewal of his will to survive. Recently terrified that his breakdown-induced amnesia might mean the loss of what his wife would call "your self, the memories that make up yr. person," his recovery drives him to relive his life--as a boy in the suburbs of 

<b></b>

 Philadelphia and on the streets of New York; as a young man traveling with a beloved aunt on the grand tour of Europe; as a fledgling poet in the salons of Venice, London, and Paris, and backpacking on the roads of Provence; as a mature husband and lover in Venice and Rapallo; and as an aging man on the winding path up from Rapallo to its surrounding cliffs.  </p>

<p>As emphatic as it is, though, the brio Pound conveys in these passages does not mean that <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> have moved beyond the ideological and political concerns of his Italian drafts. In the opening of Canto 76 we find carried over from Pound's Italian "Eliseo" that "the sun in his great periplum" still "leads in his fleet here ... under our craggy cliffs," and that "la scalza" is still to be seen where the hillpath ascends, moaning "they have broken my house" (C76/472-73). The suite, that is, continues to inhabit the world in which "the barbarian storm [let loose by the iconoclasts] descended on [sacred] ground." </p>

<p>One could discount, of course, the vestiges of Fascist Italy in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> by arguing that Pound, like Milton, came to believe that utopia cannot exist in the mixed motives of the political world and must be given up for "A paradise within thee, happier far."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> But if we look at a passage from Canto 74 that is sometimes invoked to substantiate such a reading, we find no such resignation: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

<p>Pound here alludes to an African fable related by the German anthropologist Leo Frobenius that tells of the Fasa tribe and their city of Wagadu. The fable, "Gassire's Lute," explains that the city was four times destroyed and will someday be again rebuilt for the last time; it is, in the words of Carroll Terrell, "destined to live so forcefully in the minds of men that she will never be lost again."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  But, as the phrase "Italia tradita" ("betrayed Italy") implies, Pound's invocation of the tale affirms no transcendence of the politics of the world but rather that Italy's bricks and stones may be reconstructed in the faithfulness of our memory. </p>

<p>Not only in this passage, then, but everywhere in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> "the descent of the iconoclasts" exhibited in images of European ruin drawn from the pages of the wartime <i>Corriere della Sera</i> is insisted on and then opposed by rehearsing the (now-destroyed) icons of Italian culture--"monuments" in which (and in the memory of which) the "history" of the culture has been "recorded." It is only through such "resurgent EIKONE ," Pound implies, that we can attain "Elysium" by apprehending the <i>form</i> through whose shaping power these monuments were created in the first 

<b></b>

 place. In "the whole of medieval philosophy," Pound comments, "every spiritual form sets in movement the bodies in which (or among which) it finds itself" and energy is a matter of the kind of "shape" that we see in "the rose that [a] magnet makes in the iron filings" (<i>LE</i>, 188, 154). </p>

<p>The culmination of this association of memory, form, and intuition in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> can be found in the justly famous epiphany at the center of Canto 81, where Pound encounters a vision of Aphrodite within his tent. Suddenly able to extract the intelligible form of Love itself from the remembered presence of the eyes of a number of beloved women in Carneval masks, Pound, with the same sense of discovery he displayed in Canto 74 when he emphatically declared that "This liquid is certainly a / property of the mind," encounters the full form of Love and finds himself transported first to "the seen" and "then thus the palpable / Elysium, though it were in the halls of hell": </p>

<p class="continued">Pound's delight here is clear even if his terminology is obscured by the New Directions text, which altered Pound's typescript by changing the Greek word at the center of the passage into <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek05.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="37" height="15" />, a participial form which Carroll Terrell glosses as a kind of presocratic "knowing" or "seeing."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Pound's typescript, however, indicates simply "EIDOS"--a transliteration of the standard Aristotelian word for form <img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek01.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="39" height="17" />. Pound's sense is signaled by the way that he contrasts "what thou lovest well" to "dross" (Aristotelian 

<b></b>

<img class="text-replacement-bottom" src="inline-graphics/14.1bush_greek06.gif" alt="greek - inline graphic" width="32" height="16" />, or unformed matter). His celebration of the power of form was reinforced on his typescript, where, in subsequently excised lines, he specifies that what is intended by "the full EIDOS" is "the <i>form</i> to / pass and intercross / each space full of its <i>formal life</i> / that moves and keeps defined / its clarity, demarcations" (emphasis mine).<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Pound's epiphany, in other words, corresponds to an apprehension of a formal pattern that reveals the shaping power of "<i>nous</i>, of mind, apart from any man's individual mind." Because memory is central to apprehension, Pound insists, the recollection of that which we have loved and understood gives us access to such light no matter what horrors have overtaken us. The rest is truly dross, as it is unrelated to the EIDOS of Love which grounds all meaning and whose presence Pound has newly apprehended in the most wretched of prisons.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Canto 81 goes on to hold that this "Elysium" is one that sustains the courage, order, and grace of "scaled invention or true artistry" (C81/541) and so links with Paradise the two senses of icon that Pound had implied in the phrase "resurgent EIKONE "--the sense of a remembered likeness and the sense of a formed image in which history inheres. As Pound had intended since he started to think about writing a Paradise in the early 1930s, then, this "Elysium" exists "dove sta memoria"--"where memory liveth," for it arises, in Peter Makin's words, only when "the original passion was strong," that is, only by loving well can we contemplate the essential shapes of the world (<i>PC</i>, 186). But from the above account of the origins of the suite in wartime Italy, it should be clear that <i>The Pisan Cantos</i>' grand synthesis of memory and love implies more than that. Canto 81's "Elysium," after all, grew directly out of the Italian 1945 "Eliseo" draft in which icons of memory include not only lost loves but also "morti" amid "il sangue sparso"--the dead associated with the spilt blood of Fascism. No less than in Canto 73, where the voice of Guido Cavalcanti himself trumpets faith in the Fascist movement, the Cavacanti-like understanding of memory in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> is inextricably linked with the imperatives announced in the <i>Corriere della Sera</i> in the last days of Mussolini to remember "il sangue Italiano" and to condemn the Allied and Jewish "iconoclasts" who have descended upon the sacred ground of Italy. </p>

<p><i>The Pisan Cantos</i>, that is to say, present us with a celebration of the process of recollection that is both dazzling and irredeemably compromised. On the one hand, the techniques Pound devised to articulate recollective immediacy were so successful that they were taken up by several generations of American poets, beginning with Robert Lowell and Charles Olson and culminating in the vogue for confessional poetry of the following decades. On the other, Pound clearly intended, beginning in the Italian drafts of 1944-45, to present an "arte monda"--a "clean" art deliberately purified of the commercial and abstract practices of Semitic "iconoclasm." The Fascist orientation of this desire continues to pervade <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> and remains firmly rooted in the ideological passions of the last year of the Second World War. It is the final irony of this story that in the way he theorized his "resurgent EIKONE " Pound may have violated the deepest truth of his own vision. After all, based on the proposition that contemporary history is not visible to its contestants under the aspect of eternity, he had admonished the potential readers of "Eliseo" not to seek in Elysium images from the 

<b></b>

 just-spilt blood of the war ("il sangue sparso fa il conducente / non cercate qui i nuovi ([i] vostri) morti") because the significance of the dead will not have been formed yet ("non son formati ancora"). Yet in <i>The Pisan Cantos</i> he himself continued to allude to "300 years culture at the mercy of a tack hammer / thrown thru the roof" (C74/454) and to associate his earthly paradise as much with the memory of Fascism's recent martyrs as with the muse-like res once loved by the gods and heroes of antiquity and by Pound himself in his youth. </p>

Davidson, <i>Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes on Intellect: Their Cosmologies, Theories of the Active Intellect, and Theories of the Human Intellect</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), 89-94. Avicenna like Aristotle holds that memory retains perceptions for the uses of cogitation. However, he also maintains that a second kind of memory consists of a "perfect disposition" to "reestablish conjunction with the active intellect vis a vis the given thought" . In this sense, memory not only prepares a formed trace, it also functions as an essential bridge to the world of perfect form. In the words of Davidson, translating Avicenna: "Images are transformed into universal concepts 'not in the sense that they are themselves transported from the imagination to the human intellect ... but in the sense that examining them prepares the soul for the abstract concept to emanate upon it from the active intellect'" .  </p>

But he adds that the story was probably exaggerated at the time: more likely, he explains, "Caterina entered the fortress and took command of it. Once inside ... [when her enemies] hinted that such a betrayal would lead to the murder of her children, Caterina shouted at them the lie that a new infant was just now growing in her body and the obvious truth that she could always remarry and produce others.

<p id="lead">

1931 was a fateful year, for it marked the inauguration of Negritude and the grand opening of<i> l'exposition coloniale</i>, France's spectacular display of imperial might and demonstration of the success of its global <i>mission civilisatrice</i>. In the suburb of Vincennes, the French could encounter a grand and detailed simulation of the nation's vast imperial possessions. Full-scale reproductions of African villages, medina marketplaces of the Maghreb, and the ruins of Cambodia's Angor Wat were all erected and placed along the Parisian city limits.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The exhibition was composed of hundreds of ornate pavilions, which were to represent European colonial outposts the world over, featuring the French possessions with monuments to great colonial battles and exotic architecture from the colonies.  </p>

<p>In 1931 the French Empire was at its zenith. Next to Great Britain, France was the second largest imperial power at the time with a significant presence on virtually every continent. In Africa, 

<b></b>

 France held the Maghreb, most of west and central Africa, and had a strategic post in the continent's eastern coastal region with Djibouti and French Somalia. France was second to Great Britain in the Middle East and the Caribbean, and rivaled Great Britain in Asia with its possession of Indochina and much of the Pacific Islands. Colonialism appeared universal at this point in history, the vast territories of the world had been divided and apportioned among "the lords of human kind."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Although the primary purpose of the exhibition of 1931 was to demonstrate for the world the extent of French imperialism, the fair also advanced the goals of European expansion and the ideals of colonialism in general. Thus, the planners felt it essential that each European nation that had ever held colonies, no matter how minor, participated in the exhibition by constructing a pavilion. The Portuguese designed an immense pavilion to reflect the architecture of Angola's expired Kongo kingdom; the Belgians erected a mock central African village as their entry; and the Dutch modeled theirs on ornate Javanese stilt houses. The United States also fitted comfortably among the imperial powers and offered exhibitions on Alaska, Hawaii, the Panama Canal, and the Philippines. Denmark placed the igloos and, perversely enough, the Inuit of Greenland themselves on display and Italy reconstructed a Roman basilica from Libya. Only Britain, the one nation that surpassed the French in colonial domination, did not participate in the exhibition.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Although Britain's absence was a noticeable loss, the exhibition was determined, nonetheless, toward a show of completion through the reconstruction of what may be perhaps one of the first ideological attempts to advance the notion of a "global village." Colonialism, the propaganda boasted, had united the world, spreading the modern advances of the metropolis in its path. The 1931 exposition was thus the realization of both the colonial ideal and the idealization of modernity, representing at once the culmination of imperialist expansion at its apogee and its moment of impending decline.  </p>

<p>It comes as little surprise then that France's final display of colonial omnipotence would implement architectural aesthetics that simultaneously conveyed the imperialist triumphalism of the civilizing mission and the pessimistic self-reflexivity of modernism. Unlike earlier exhibitions which had amplified the cultural and material differences between the colonized and Europe through spectacular displays of "acts of savagery," the planners of the 1931 colonial exhibition, although no less exoticist, made use of the principle of "synthesis." Gone were the collections of crude huts and lean-tos that had comprised the "native" sections of previous fairs; in their place were towering modern primitivist pavilions. Organizers proclaimed: "[The pavilions] are the architectural resume of the exotic world."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In designing these constructions, exhibition architects were to incorporate somehow the union of opposites in their final structures: the primitive and the modern, the material and the cultural, the past and the future.  </p>

<p>The two central exhibits, the reconstruction of the west African fort Djenné (<a href="#1">1</a>.) and the Cambodian temple Angor Wat provide the most impressive example of the organizers' modernizing impulse. Structures were built significantly larger than their originals in Asia and Africa, their facades were smoothed and modernized, and the dimensions of their towers were exaggeratedly angular to imitate the formal excess of 

<b></b>

 the cubists. In his work on international exhibitions, Robert Rydell refers to this mode of <i>trompe l'oeil</i> as the "Coloniale Moderne." After the First World War the aura of truimphalism which infused the idea of Empire began for the first time to appear as an anachronism, an idea that had reached its culmination and end; he argues the "Coloniale Moderne" was a way to reanimate imperialism by infusing it with the immediacy of the modern. "[The 1931 Colonial Exhibition] was a way of making imperialism seem as fundamental to modernity as the architectural fantasies of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe." The public had to be convinced that "imperialism provided the bedrock on which modern times and progress depended" (<i>WF</i>, 64). Indeed the modernization of colonial architecture served to dissolve the incommensurable otherness of the primitive, enabling the entry of the colonized into the wider human community of "<i>le plus Grand France</i>," a "Greater France," organized around a shared aesthetic principle. Rydell simply reads these exhibitions as somewhat transparent advertisements for the political and technological aims of the day, in which modernism is reduced to a stylistic means to garner public support for Western global supremacy. This was of course the explicit aim of colonial exhibitions and world fairs, but the use of modernist aesthetics implies more than a proleptic measure to ward against public disinterest in the colonies. The 1931 exhibition also presents us with more recondite questions concerning aesthetics, politics, and the ideological transformation of modernism itself at the historical conjuncture when the hint of empire's long anticipated decline surfaced at its peak. </p>

<p>Modernism also anticipates the acknowledgment of failure within colonial discourse and then displaces this anxiety on to the re of the primitive. In psychoanalysis and Marxist linguistic theory, displacement has been tied to the tropes of metaphor and metonymy. Through, for example, the metaphoric displacement of the phobic object, the subject is able to contain and objectify his or her anxiety. One can speak of the "Other" through another more familiar object, dulling its effect and its power, by equating it with something banal or unthreatening. Nevertheless, to express the modality of modernism and imperialist aesthetics, it is necessary to introduce the trope of synecdoche as well. Both France and Africa, colonized and colonial, civilized and primitive, are demonstrably put via the Colonial Fair into synecdochial relationship to Greater France, which, more than displaying a simple name change, designates a totality which possesses a shared world historic, albeit ineffable, quality that suffuses and constitutes the essential nature of the multiple parts that make it up. What positive qualities Greater France actually imparts to its members remains opaque and even vaporous, though the grandeur of the idea itself was meant, as Rydell is correct to underline, to impress and instill loyalty among working-class French and colonized alike. Nonetheless, the parts of the French Empire were indeed integrated within a whole that was imagined to be <i>qualitatively</i> different from the sum of the parts and of which the parts were but <i>microcosmic</i> replications. The colonial exhibition materialized these synecdochial methods in its representation of "Greater France"; indeed the culminating achievement is the integration of that which differs most from the French ideal and the infusion and domination of its primitive identity by its membership in Greater France. Primitivism no longer then signified the radical exteriority of modernity. Primitivism had long been standard fare for modernist art, but it had been, by and large, linked to a pessimistic narrative of modernity; understood exclusively within the history of the European avant-garde the primitive marked the limits and failures of modernity, delimiting that realm of the irrational which modern consciousness could no longer subsume. The transformative potential of the primitive was thought to inhere in its intangibility, which bound it to Western aesthetics' long held idea of the elusiveness of the art object itself, its ability to defy both the "terror of time" through ephemeral beauty, as well as the hegemony of exchange-value through the art object's uselessness. As modernity unfolded through violent fits and upheavals, reconring time through the unreflective destruction of the old, modernism sought a countervailing force in the "timelessness" of the Other.  </p>

<p>However, by interacting with the architectural aims of imperialism, primitivism was emptied of its critical orientation towards modernity and instead facilitated the signification of the successful assimilation of the Other. It is through the representation of Africa as a docile and assimilated Other that modernism redefined and reanimated the imperialist aesthetic of triumph. In earlier exhibitions Africa was the site of intractable savagery, unassimilable to the rigors of civil society and incommensurable with the rest of humanity. For France to laud the culmination of Empire, it had to celebrate the assimilation of what it considered most to be disparate.

<p>Naturally, the mode of representations of subject populations was linked to the historical aims of the imperial nations themselves. While the exhibition of 1931 represented a world unified by the spirit of modernization, earlier exhibitions were concerned with the violent acquisition of colonies and the extraction of resources. World Fairs and Colonial Exhibitions "reflected attempts of nations to forge a popular consensus over their priorities and their vision of progress as racial supremacy and economic growth" (<i>WF</i>, 10). They were immense spectacular events that took annual inventory of the advance of modernity and Western dominance throughout the globe. At each fair, artifacts from parts of the globe, previously unknown to Europeans, were brought in, showcased, and exhibited in a manner which mocked and exaggerated the presumed savagery of the newly colonized. Earlier fairs propagandized the public to accept extreme violence as the sole and necessary means for the conquest of colonies. Through representations of violent and dreadful native "practices" such as cannibalism and human sacrifice, the exhibitions served to elevate the imperialist wars and battles from little followed events in distant lands to feats of heroism and the sacred duties of the civilized West. The caged native warrior, ruthless and fierce, became the metanymic re for African and Asian peoples who dared resist the violent "pacification" of the imperialists. Take for example the Dahomian exhibition at the Paris World Fair of 1889, the same year France began its military campaign to capture this west African kingdom. The display was among the most popular with visitors, featuring a sacrificial totem—the tower of Abomey made of roughly hewn wood, caked in blood, and covered with ornate masks. While the threatening wood masks depicted skulls, signifying the totem's use in ritual sacrifice, what generated the most fascination and outrage were reports that the blood on the totem, used even in the exhibition, was human. Thus, overnight the Dahomey exhibit became the symbolic juggernaut that tested the resolve of the French civilizing mission.  </p>

<p>To the French public who attended the exhibition and read the popularized reports of the nation's military campaign, tales of cannibalism and human sacrifice not only marked the boundaries of the psychic object but also cast the colonized, in this instance Africa, as the eternally unassimilable Other. The form of exoticism used in the fin de siècle exhibitions was imbricated with both the historical demands of imperialist primitive accumulation and Victorian aesthetic conventions that displaced social transgressions and taboos on to a demonized Other. These exhibitions were constructed with sharp and clear spatial and architectural boundaries drawn between the civilized and savage. Technology, monuments, aesthetic and formal experimentation were found exclusively in the European pavilions which publicly displayed for the first time marvels like the Eiffel Tower, Art Nouveau, or the <i>Trocedero</i>. The primitive practice, however, served as more than a metonym for the colonized, for there was a synecdochial relationship to barbarism. By making it the only quality of the Other to be represented, thus insinuating that it dominated and infused them, the early fairs served to consolidate the myth of the incommensurability of the colonized. In this way, the colonized were 

<b></b>

 cast out of the bonds of a mutual humanity that alone could have deprived the horrific violence of primitive accumulation of its warrant. It is not my intention to suggest that this earlier mode of representation was dissipated wholly by modernist style. That they could coexist, as they did, speaks to the sense that what was always in question was the human agency of the colonized.  </p>

<p>In addition to its use in design, "synthesis" was meant to embody the high ideals of France's overseas policy of assimilation which colonialists felt had finally been realized in 1931 with the establishment of "<i>le plus Grand France</i>." French <i>belle lettres</i> and high culture had long been in accord with the colonial principles of assimilation. Behind the duplicitous pronouncements of universal reason, and the universal rights of man in the colonies, stood the very real colonial policy that sanctioned the obliteration and suppression of native cultures and the imposition of French language, institutions, and laws. Senghor sniped: "The French wants bread for all, culture for all, liberty for all; but this liberty, this culture, and this bread will be French. The universalism of this people is French."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  However, despite the long acceptance for the idea of a Greater France among the ruling class, many French colonialists felt that the ordinary citizen was hopelessly cosmopolitan and cared little about the colonies. There was almost the implication of an aristocratic epistemology, to borrow a concept from Georg Lukács, such that only the ruling class could intuit those qualities, which imparted greatness to each part of the greater French whole. The spectacular construction of the French empire in miniature placed strategically in the working-class suburbs of Vincennes, would provide an object lesson to the French people of the realization of a modernist France, a France which had successfully assimilated difference and had drawn into its rationalized and metropolitan core the enchanting periphery. The Colonial Minister Paul Reynaud opened the exposition stating that the goal was "to give the French a consciousness of their empire. . . . Each one of us must feel himself a citizen of the greater France." He urged the French public, from this day on, to think of the metropole as extending far beyond the boundaries of Paris, encompassing its colonial possessions: "France is an indivisible whole. The old France of Europe and the young France overseas have grown slowly closer . . . have mixed with each other and have become inseparable."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Such was the organizer's vision of colonial "syntheses," embedded in the unique form of architectural métissage each structure bore. The sharp angular style of "<i>l'art nègre</i>," which had been condemned a decade before for having corrupted the aesthetic purity of French modern art, was now the exemplary formal convention used to represent the idea of the "indivisible whole" of greater France. Africa, because it stood as the most distant and barbaric continent in the French imagination, became the signifier of a successfully assimilated periphery, and its art, as I shall now argue, became the totem of a totalized vision of modernity.  </p>

<p>The pavilion dedicated to the colonial ideal, <i>La Section de Synthèse </i>(<a href="#2"> 2</a>), narrates best the historical revisions concealed within the veneer of modernist inclusion. 

<b></b>

 <i>La Section de Synthèse</i> housed the museum of French colonial history. A long and intricate stone fresque encases the length of the building's classical facade, depicting the people, flora, and fauna of the French possessions, each blending fluidly with the other. The exhibition catalogue relates the artist's intentions to render the harmonious integration of humanity into the idea of France. The design of the fresque emphasizes motion; the features, limbs, and details of each nation run uninterrupted into the other, suspending both uniformity and difference. Each region maintains its distinct nature, but this heterogeneity is unified in the fluidity and circuitous construction of the fresque. By flanking the sides of the pavilion, the fresque gives the illusion of encircling the building. The contrasting fluidity of the fresque design encompasses the interior display of "French Imperial history," encasing it, as it were, in a stone rendition of the "Peaceable Kingdom." But the imposition of the Roman columns lining the facade belies the modernist gesture toward the inclusion and synthesis of disruptive marginal elements. Superimposed on the design's mutable res is the grid, organizing the family of man in an unambiguous racial hierarchy. </p>

<p>The "History" relayed in the exhibit's interior bluntly narrates what the imperial columns silently suggest. Maps of the globe, marking the French territories, cover the four immense walls of the exhibit hall. The topological display of Empire in maps, rings of flags, and statues of victorious soldiers reduce the scale of Greater France to the level of the visitor. The exhibition catalogue entreats the visitor to enter the pavilion and wander through the vast scope of French possessions in order to experience it in its totality. The captions beneath the sterile monuments of colonial victory revise and suppress the violence and terror that were a vital part of the actual "synthesis" of the 

<b></b>

 colonies. The revised history of the colonial conquest is one of the benevolent encounter between reason and the "irrational."  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p><i>Tels sont [les] points principaux que développe la Section de Synthèse . . . Ce que nous avons apporté tout d'abord dans nos possessions, c'est la paix. En Afrique du Nord, des 1830, notre expédition étouffait ces redoutables foyers de piraterie semés sur toute la côte algérienne, en Indochine, nous avons libéré les peuples de l'oppression des mandarins et des pirates, nous avons en Afrique surtout, le plus infortuné des continents, on peut le dire, littéralement sauvé toute une race vouée à l'extinction.</i><sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> </p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>In this articulation of the aims of imperialism, synthesis is synonymous with the task of salvation. In its infinite benevolence France is drawn to the colonies by a divine calling to set things right. Related in the passage above is the belief that each of these regions of the world was gripped to various degrees by chaos, disorder, and brutal mayhem. Bringing these vast and hostile sections of the globe into the sight of the metropolitan city was not a simple task of pacification; rather it was a managerial effort in reorganization. The expressed aim of synthesis was to save the colonies from the chaos that infused and guided their natures, to reform them by bringing them under universal rule. Synthesis was thus a full-scale effort in classification and colonial typography, a way of placing the empire's possessions in the proper position in a representation of the hierarchy of man. This is illustrated in the passage above in a serial description of each region's "troubled past." Measuring the rest of the globe against Europe, the description begins with an image of North Africa, plagued by pirates, and ends with sub-Saharan Africa. As in the earlier exhibitions, Africa marks the limits of French universalist resolve; it is described as a continent "on the verge of extinction," a measure of that which should be impossible to redeem or recuperate. As the text goes on to state how the synthesis of Africa—the site of what were most contrary to the "professed" ideals of France: slavery, despotism, and savagery—becomes an example of the unquestionable success of the assimilation policy. In speaking about Africa the text deflects the gross abuse and violence of French colonial history on to native culprits.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The history of slavery, enforced labor, daily terror and violence, atrocities the French justified as the necessary means to civilize the savage in Victorian exhibitions, are absent in the 1931 revisions. In their place is a Hobbsian state of violence, violence that is endemic to the region, an archaic violence that knows no French participants. The catalogue explains that France has saved the Africans from their own despotic black sultans, "<i>les plus féroces négriers du monde</i>," and has ushered the continent into a state of peace never known to them until now. The fresque's res of Africans, frozen in harmonious interaction with the animals and fauna of their environment, speaks in the 

<b></b>

 most fantastic image of their peaceful existence within the totality of France. From the exhibition's emphasis on the ornamental use of the "passive African," one can see how closely colonialist synthesis resembles the structure of aesthetic sublimation; but unlike classical aesthetics where the union of opposites engender a third, distinct, and more beautiful form, the colonized are erased in and through sublime representation, those representational res signifying absence. Whatever subversive force with which one may wish to invest these hybrid images—how after all could one object to such beautiful depictions?—they serve ultimately to empty from these representations those who have been sacrificed for the making of a Greater France, or rather to confine them impossibly to tyrannically beautiful forms which are emptied of their historical presence. That which is unspeakable cannot go unsaid without ever more unspeakable violence.  </p>

<p>Other pavilions represented something other than the propangadist transmutation of imperialism into a Greater France. For example, in the Belgian pavilion, we find complex processes of appropriation and mimicry: on the one hand, the Belgian colonizers appropriate and deploy fetishized objects of the colonized to signify the omnipotence and centrality of Belgian rule; on the other hand, the Other is synecdochically defined as primitive—the artifacts of savage violence and fetishistic practice are used as ontological representations of the other. Michael Taussig examines this process of appropriation in the context of mimetic exchange between the colonized and colonizer. Mimesis, he argues, is not only an attempt to imitate the "outside" of the Other, it is a method of usurping its power, of appropriating and reconring its meaning. Although Taussig's analysis of mimetic exchange concentrates primarily on the ways in which the colonized use mimesis to negotiate and make sense of Western norms, norms frequently violently imposed on them, he makes clear that mimesis entails the "mutual interpretation of the images and symbols of cultural difference"; for this reason his work is of great use to the discussion here of the modernist deployment of "primitivist" style in the pavilions to signify the consolidation of empire.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Taussig maintains that both the colonized and colonizer engage in acts of mimetic exchange in an effort to penetrate and contain the potency of the "Other" by mastering the vital elements of their respective symbolic universes. Mastery in this sense does not imply "getting it right," for the mimic does not flawlessly reproduce the customs of the Other; rather, mastery involves the seizure of the Other's cultural affects such as secret ceremonies or rituals and the redeployment of these practices for one's own ends. Mimesis, Taussig reminds us, always circulates within the matrix of colonial power; it is not a free and equal system of exchange, rather it is a process enmeshed in, and distorted by, the colonial realities of terror and exploitation. We do not have here Bhabha's "hybrid displacing space," developing in free interaction between the indigenous and colonial culture, much less the undermining of imperialist authority or authenticity. In a recent review of Taussig's work, however, Michael Baud mistakenly aligns Taussig's theory of mimesis with Bhabha's rather seamless conception of "hybridization," which Bhabha offers in place of "the noisy command of colonialist authority or the silent repression of native traditions."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Far from abstracting from the context of colonial violence, Taussig's prose is replete with experiments to induce in the 

<b></b>

 reader the terrors of uncertainty which suffuse the native so as to enable understanding, however partial, of the context in which the mimesis of the colonizer is carried out; moreover, Taussig has attempted to induce awareness in Western academics of how the mental stability with which they attempt their brilliant hermeneutics of the Other themselves depend on counter-terror against chaos.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> </p>

<p>We can see such an act of mimetic containment in the exhibition's Belgian Congo pavilion (. <a href="#3">3</a> and <a href="#4">4</a>). As is clear in the picture of the exterior, the Belgian pavilion, even more than the west African fortress, exhibits the modern primitivist style of the era. The design emphasis is on the display of tribal fetishes, imposing ceremonial masks and shields. The catalogue tells us that the pavilion was designed to be both impressive and picturesque. Evoking the "memory of indigenous customs, the villages and battles between the many tribes," the pavilion combines the representations of the placid pastoral life and the savage rivalry of tribal warfare.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The structure is composed of an immense thatched dome, supported by a ring of rustic columns adorned with masks and "fetish" reliefs. We find the more modern interpretation of an "African" aesthetic, however, in the pavilion courtyard. In front of the complex of thatched circular buildings, there stands opposite each other two rows of elliptical and yet sharply geometric shields, each supporting a very tall spear that doubles as a flagpole. With such an array of flags, spears, and shields at the entrance to the pavilion, the feeling of entering a national palace or a consulate building is generated. </p>

<p>The history of the Belgians in the Congo is anything but picturesque. Joseph Conrad referred to the Berlin Congress of 1887 as the "vilest scramble for loot that ever disred the history of human conscience."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  It was at this congress, called to settle Europe's inter-imperial rivalries, that the gathered states granted King Leopold II his wish to make Belgium the capital of an immense empire, for which he received all of central Africa. Commenting on Leopold's designs, one British consul expressed the wish that territories so immense would, at last, silence the edacious monarch by "choking him."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  But so large an empire did not silence King Leopold, and he went on to impose a reign of terror in the colony that lasted two decades.The state was set up as Leopold's personal financial enterprise, abandoning the "political" and institutional pretenses employed in the French or British colonies. Leopold had no professed civilizing mission; the mission of the Belgians in the region was to extract as much labor effort and raw resources as they could, regardless of human cost. Recruiting forced labor on rubber plantation and mines, the colonizers imposed inhuman quotas on the workers, cutting off worker's hands and feet if they failed to meet their quota. In this sense the Belgian Congo was a cruder and crueler articulation of the civilizing mission than the British and French colonial ventures, which coupled violent exploitation with "benevolent" institutions. The Congo became synonymous with the excesses and horrors of imperialism. Sartre writes "in the colonies the truth stands naked."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Indeed the horrors of the exploitation of the industrial working class in the nineteenth century were magnified tremendously in the colonies in the twentieth. The consumption of human life approached genocidal proportions.  </p>

<p>Yet in the Belgian pavilion the "naked truth" of the violence of primitive accumulation is concealed and displaced in the monumental reproduction of an "African fetish."

<p class="continued">

 Taussig is quite helpful here in understanding the aesthetic repression and deferral of violence in the colonies. Examining the narratives of primitive accumulation in the colonies—travel reports from the Belgian Congo, the Andes, and Amazon basin—Taussig describes how mimesis functions in these "spaces of terror." The colonizer, he argues, "discovers the evil they have imputed to the colonized, and mimic the savagery they have imputed" (<i>SCW</i>, 70). In an effort to stress their absolute difference from the idolater, the fetishist or savage, the colonizer ascribes supernatural powers to the native, his land, and culture, the strength of which justify savage means of repression. We find in the pavilion representation of the artifactual significations of these powers attributed to the primitive. This is not surprising, for within the lived "economy of terror" the cultural affects of the Other take on tremendous symbolic value for the colonized. Masks, fetishes, and other artifacts function at once as worthless trinkets, the mark of the colonized's absolute difference toward the West, and instruments of power, frightening objects deployed by the colonized to counter the colonizer's "magic." For this reason they cannot be simply ignored or dismissed as objects that defy symbolization; in order for the colonizer to declare themselves rulers, the objects of the colonized must be incorporated into their system of domination. Thus the taking up of African artifacts as synecdoche to signify the completion of the "civilizing mission" should not be understood as a belated gesture of recognition towards the aesthetic worth of African cultural production; extending Taussig's notion of mimesis here, such gestures as the appropriation of African architecture should appear to us as controlling actions rather than an act of belated reconciliation.  </p>

<p>The violence of primitive accumulation sets in motion an economy of terror in which the spirits of the dead and exploited linger in both the landscape and histories of these frontier societies; the demands for restitution for the wrongs suffered as a result of the West's insatiable demand for raw resources make up the subtext of what is understood as a "primitive" thematic of haunting and possession. In the hands of the explorer, the overseer, or European technician, native artifacts become mediating instruments through which the excesses of colonial violence may be indirectly confronted. Taussig tells the story of Roger Casement, friend of Joseph Conrad and witness to two particularly vicious colonial campaigns—the establishment of rubber plantations in both the Belgian Congo and Brazil—who towards the end of his career began to collect native fetishes ostensibly for his own safety (<i>SCW</i>, 131). Casement's story is but one example of the manner in which native artifacts serve to protect or shield the colonizers from the repercussions of frontier violence. One might surmise that Casement used the fetishes to protect himself from what he had <i>become</i> in the violent frontier. Like the wayward Kurtz in <i>Heart of Darkness, </i>Casement understands himself as having fallen prey to the corrosive effects of his environment. The fetishes were to ward off further degeneration in spirit that his long stays in the jungle had set in motion, as well as to protect him from the inevitable retaliation of natives for the savage deeds of the Europeans.  </p>

<p>Casement is an example of an imperialist "gone native," mimetically appropriating and internalizing the symbolic values of the Other, but this cycle of appropriation 

<b></b>

 signifies neither the "openness" of the colonizer to the ways of the colonized as some critics assert, nor is it evidence of the inherent subversiveness of the primitive in the face of Western efforts of totalization.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Far from disrupting the modern, the imagined primitive, especially its supernatural aspects, becomes the license for colonial violence in its psychic and colonial forms. While the European traffic in things "primitive" is enclosed in a peculiar and mystifying dialectic actually brought about by the initial violent encounter between the colonized and colonizer, the natural state of these regions is one of primeval violence which infects and bewilders all who come into contact with it. An embodiment of the "surreal" couplet of violence and desire, Casement's story is one of many representations of the colonial world in terms of its inherent "magical real" quality to disturb all notions of unified subjecthood. There is of course the hyperbole of Conrad's Kurtz, reduced to the ambiguity of sado-masochistic horror and unable to return to reason and by implication, Europe. The grotesque here is less in the colonial officer or even the narrative, but the Congo itself.  </p>

<p>In the Belgian pavilion the savagery of imperialist history is allocated to the masks, the imposing shields, and spears. This monument which the catalogue explains is designed in the style of a "great African chief," transmits the centralized power of Leopold's kingdom.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The civilizing influence, by contrast, resides in the presence of the Belgian mining societies represented in a panorama circling the pavilion's interior. A contemporary columnist Charles D'Ydwelle described it thus:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . a type of Negro palace, of such a kind that doubtless no Negro king has inhabited, but it passably recalls, with its domes and its palisades certain sultanates of central Africa. At the center of the dome of yellow straw matting seems to dominate an illusory city, a city of new straw matting. The columns are loaded with rustic images of a somber barbarity . . .</p>
<p>We enter on the same floor. From a blue dome, a soft light falls on a blue pavement. This is the patio around which are grouped galleries and dioramas. Dim light favorable for study. All along the periphery we discover colossal factories. One sole mining society employs more than four thousand white agents and thirty thousand black workers.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Racism makes D'Ydwelle skeptical that the pavilion represents an actual African palace. His comment that no "Negro king" has ever lived in such a structure is informed by racialist theories of Paul Vidal, the French geographer who created a taxonomy that equated racial characteristics with the population's respective milieu. Within this theory reminiscent of Spenglerian morphology, architecture was the externalization of known "racial essence," and since in D'Ydwelle's estimation Africans were at the bottom of this hierarchy, any structure of that magnitude could not be an accurate representation of their milieu. For D'Ydwelle, the pavilion is not sufficiently barbaric, and he makes the mistake of separating the various "styles" into their constitutive racial components. He comments on the Belgian's neat and orderly "raked white sands"; juxtaposing that with the straw matting, he remarks: "this ensemble of savagery and gardening is perhaps a good enough summary of the Belgian aesthetic in Africa."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  This is only one reason why D'Ydwelle misses the point of the pavilion, which is not to render a display of African power, or even, for that matter the region's vast cultural or aesthetic diversity. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>What is more interesting are D'Ydwelle's comments on the interior diorama. The tone of hasty outrage gone from his description, the columnist goes on to detail what he is most familiar with and what most pleases him about the pavilion—the colossal factory. Alas, D'Ydwelle's contempt for the "ensemble of savagery and gardening" unwittingly reveals to us the pavilion's true fetish object, the object within which the "energies of men" are transformed and concealed within the "thing." For it is only as a contrast to a fantastic and primitive world that the mining complex can be fetishized as a rational organization of energy, regardless of who benefits from its wealth or the millions of human lives which have been consumed in its operation. D'Ydwelle lapses into the language of worship and awe. The dim lights of a church, a library, or temple are fitting and set the mood for the visitor to behold the magnitude of "one sole mining" company, the synecdoche that has distilled and now represents the diverse qualities and energies of "four thousand white agents" and "thirty thousand black workers." The placement of the "factory" within the "pavilion's savage" exterior as a civilizing presence actually speaks more to the ideological fantasy of a "disenchanted" West than it does a wild and primeval Africa. The fusing of these two opposites—the totemic architecture and the factory—unknowingly expresses an image of the enchanted modern, haunted not by the "savage" and subversive culture of the native, but by the suppressed knowledge of modernity's own fetishistic practices. </p>

<p id="lead">Dear Herr Reisiger, </p>

<p>I am thoroughly delighted with owning a copy of your <i>The Work of Walt Whitman</i> and cannot thank you enough—as I am sure that the German public will also not be able to thank you enough for this great, important, indeed sacred gift. Ever since I acquired the two volumes, I have been constantly taking them up, reading now here and now there. I have read the biographical introduction in its entirety and deem it a minor masterpiece infused with love. It is truly a service of the highest order that you have rendered us, expending patient devotion and enthusiastic labor to acquaint us with this powerful mind and a profoundly new form of humanity—us Germans, who are at once old and immature, for whom contact with this future-shaping humanity can become a blessing, provided we know how to take up its challenge. For me personally, as someone who has inwardly busied himself with the idea of <i>Humanity</i> for years, laboring with a slowness uniquely my own, as someone persuaded that Germany faces no task more pressing than that of filling this concept with meaning, this otherwise empty shell that has become little more than a catch-phrase used in schools—for me this book has been nothing less than a gift from heaven, for now I really see that what Whitman calls "<i>democracy</i>" is nothing other than what we, in an old-fashioned usage, call "humanity"; just as I also see that it cannot be done with Goethe alone, that a shot of Whitman will be necessary to achieve the feeling of the new humanity, even though these two fatherly res have much in common, above all the sensual element, the "Calamus," a sympathy with the organic. In short, your achievement—and that word is neither too strong nor too grand—can have incalculable effects; and I, who am no longer so young at this point, would like to be among the first of those who, with a clear conscience, will congratulate you on it. </p>

<p>I greet you many times over and remain your devoted, </p>

<p>Thomas Mann.</p>

<p><i>"Hans Reisiger's Edition of Walt Whitman: A Letter"</i> first appeared in the newspaper the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i>, vol. 66, no. 285 (16 April 1922, second morning edition), 2. This translation is based on that original printing, though it should be noted that the letter has been later reprinted in Thomas Mann, <i>Gesammelte Werke in dreizehn Bänden</i>, second edition (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1974), vol. 10, and <i>Thomas Mann: Aufsätze, Reden, Essays</i>, ed. Harry Matter (East Berlin: Aufbau-Verlag, 1983–1986), vol. 3. A third reprinting took place more recently, part of the <i>Große kommentierte Frankfurter Ausgabe</i>, vol. 15, <i>Essays II: 1914–1926</i>, edited by Hermann Kurzke (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 2002). It has also been previously translated into English by Horst Frenz, in Gay Wilson Allen and Ed Folsom, eds. <i>Walt Whitman and the World</i> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995), 201. </p>

<div class="fn">
<p>Title] Hans Reisiger (1884–1968) was a German writer and translator. Mann had met him by at least 1913 and in the years that followed, until 1933, he was a close friend of Mann and his family. His translation of selected poems from <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, which appeared in 1919, left no discernible impression on Mann, who seems not to have read it. (Walt Whitman, <i>Grashalme: Neue Auswahl</i>, trans. Hans Reisiger [Berlin: S. Fischer, 1919]). But the second collection of writings by Whitman that he published three years later, <i>Walt Whitmans Werk</i> (or <i>Walt Whitman's Work</i>), elicited Mann's interest even before it was published. On 31 May, 1921 (ten months before its publication), Mann noted in his diary: "On Sunday evening Reisiger visited us and read some of his translations, which led on to discussions of Whitman's love of men." (Thomas Mann, <i>Tagebücher 1918–1921</i>, ed. Peter de Mendelssohn [Frankfurt: S. Fischer, 1979], 524). The book itself appeared in March, 1922, published by Mann's own publisher, S. Fischer. Mann wrote his review at the latest by the beginning of April, given that it was published on 16 April. Only three years later he was deprecating about the review in a letter to Anna Jacobson, saying that the intellectual substance of his encounter with the book, if there was any, had gone into his later lecture, "On the German Republic." (See Thomas Mann to Anna Jacobson, 24 October 1925, in <i>Die Briefe Thomas Manns: Regesten und Register</i>, eds. Hans Bürgin and Hans-Otto Mayer, Vol. I <i>Die Briefe von 1889 bis 1939</i> (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1977), letter no. 25/191.)  </p>

<p>108.12 for years] This would be the normal translation for Mann's expression, <i>Jahr und Tag</i> (literally, "a year and day"), and Horst Frenz even translates it as "for so many years." But as Hermann Kurzke points out, Mann's use of the expression may well reflect a general sense of "a long time," but it may also be intended more literally. For in Mann's writings prior to 1921, he consistently adopts the German term <i>Menschlichkeit</i>, rather than <i>Humanität</i>. It is only with the essay "Goethe und Tolstoy," published in April, 1921, that <i>Humanität</i> becomes his term of choice—almost literally "a year and day" before his letter to Reisiger. </p>

<p id="lead">May I remind you, Gerhart Hauptmann, that you were among the audience when I gave a lecture, at the University of Frankfurt during the Goethe-Week celebrations, about belief and education, or about humanity? You were seated in the first row, and the auditorium behind you was filled to the rafters with students. It was a lovely occasion, and I hope that this one today will prove likewise. In my imagination, I can see you before me now, just as you were then, and address you as a distinguished man on your birthday; and when I raise my glance a bit higher, I can also see the youth of Germany in the hall, listening attentively, for I want to talk to them again today, and also talk about them, and yet again talk <i>with them</i>, to borrow a phrase that appears in a locution such as "to have a bone to pick with them." I have to speak, in short: about you, whose birthday we're celebrating today, and about other, more wide-ranging concerns, or yet once again about issues concerning humanity—issues that will always receive a receptive response from German young people, or else they would cease to be German. True, it is possible that they will stamp or shuffle their feet in disapproval over what I'm about to say. But that will not matter: I shall persist and bend my heart and mind to the task of winning them over. For they have to be won over, that much is clear; and they are ready to be won over, for they are not evil, and even those who stamp or shuffle their feet are only a bit proud and stubborn. </p>

<p>To begin once again, it is not surprising that I remember with pleasure the events in Frankfurt and imagine you once more before me: undoubtedly, as I became aware only later (for in the present we never feel gratitude), they marked a high point in my life as a writer. You sat before me, Gerhart Hauptmann, as I have already said, and to your left sat Reich President Ebert. "Before king and kingdom," as Lohengrin says, "I truly unveiled my secret"—with the word "kingdom," it is clear, meant to designate Friedrich Ebert, while the word "king" refers to you. For today indeed you are a king—and who would want to deny it?—truly a people's king, as you sit there before me—the king of the Republic. Does that phrase entail a contradiction? I call upon Novalis, a royalist of a special sort, who once said that people everywhere would soon be convinced that no king could last without a republic and no republic without a king—a democratic expression 

<b></b>

 in any case, and one that invites expansion with the observation that a republic could survive without a king longer than a king without a republic (feet shuffling in the background). One should not be surprised if you, Gerhart Hauptman, in your capacity as king, were to become a complete republican, for surely our republicanization has served to greatly strengthen and illuminate your kingdom—albeit after a brief wobble in your royal status during the time of revolution. </p>

<p>We live fast. The environment of each individual is changing in the blink of an eye; "today you're dead," runs a popular expression, "and tomorrow, until further notice, you're red." It's entertaining—and it is certainly no more than that—to look into the kaleidoscope of current affairs and values, especially insofar as our own moment of fateful choice is at stake. Intellectual radicalism, which accompanied the Revolution in the literary sphere, did not take kindly to a nature such as yours. Fashionable opinion was against you. But that mood has now passed. The younger voices that dismissed you as "unintellectual" are now mute; you stand on the crest of the wave, and the social as well as democratic trends of the time are suited to your greatness. The socialism of this moment reveres you as the compassionate poet of <i>The Weavers</i> and <i>Hannele</i>, the poet of the poor. And when everything that can be said about democracy has been said, it remains true that democracy, after the downfall of a dynastic-feudal system, makes the best intellectuals of a land or nation more visible: respect for writers increases in a republican state, and correspondingly so too does their personal responsibility—whether or not this or that writer views it as desirable. </p>

<p>The means of your triumph, Gerhart Hauptmann, was your Germanness, which means your real popularity—to cite Novalis once more, who defines the ideal character of Germanness as "real popularity"—popularity of the most humane kind, as one must not hesitate to add if one is to avoid raising crude and pedestrian misunderstandings: already humane in the source of its historical origins. (Fellow-students! ["Well, I never!"] Yes, I am addressing you, German students, insofar as you have felt yourselves obliged to shuffle your feet several times over some of my words.) The last major foreign fructification of our literature occurred in the eighties and nineties of the last century, when Ibsen, Zola, and the great Russian writers reached us, arriving at the same moment as the breakthrough of naturalism and a breath of fresh air discernible among the newest elements of Germany. And who was the poet which this cosmopolitan artistic movement produced? Which major re did it leave behind? That was the movement that shaped the ultra-German nature of Gerhart Hauptman, that raised this masterly writer to the heights, a writer who today, by virtue of his popularity, has risen to a princely status, acknowledged by both domestic and foreign critics as the intellectual leader of the post-imperial nation. It is worthwhile to reflect on that fact. It is worthwhile, as well, in the case of the poet Stefan George: true, his early years were indelibly marked by the prophets Baudelaire and the Parnassians; yet his life, his stature, and his influence have made him a matter of high and purely national concern. Wherever greatness is found, a nation's character inevitably breaks through in it, notwithstanding a writer's cosmopolitan leanings, and among us Germans at least it seems to be a fundamental law, that he who loses himself also preserves himself, while he who tries to preserve 

<b></b>

 himself, loses himself, lapsing into barbarism or respectable mediocrity. (Once more I hear feet shuffling.) </p>

<p>Humane, I say, and not crude or pedestrian: such is the creative Germanness of this man as found in his literary trajectory. Humane and of the people, I must add, yet neither simple nor boorish and boisterous; but liberal in the most human sense, peace-loving, with the gentleness and dignity that are confered by culture. We revere him for his German character, his noble genuineness, and his wide popularity. During the privation and affliction of the war, how could he not have felt the attendant suffering within himself! Yet he did not engage in ostentatious philanthropy. He conducted himself as a man of letters; he didn't go to Zurich and sit there, slandering his land and people with pacifist rhetoric. With heart and voice he stood by Germany, and did so yet again when it came time to face with sorrow the loss of Germany's border districts, as decreed by the doubtful wisdom of the winners; so that when he left the hall after a speech, on one occasion, the audience followed his noble, fatherly re into the street, unwilling to leave him, tireless in offering testimonies of their affection for him. How could he have been perceived as a father-re and spokesman for the people—and great cultural traditions are still alive in the depths of the people's unconscious being, undeniably shaping its conscience—how could he have been so perceived if his popularity had been of a narrow, chauvinistic sort devoid of humanity? Real and truly German popularity can never be of that kind. Whatever Europe may say, we have never lost the sense of <i>humanitas</i> as an idea, a feeling, an ethical and intellectual regulating principle, an unwavering awareness that the state is only "a particular union of a group of people within the great state that humanity makes up for itself" (to borrow yet again an appropriate phrase from the poet who, it would seem, will be my compurgator in what I have to say today); and no other people have so thoughtfully, in the depths of conscience and the heights of intellect, pondered the values of the national and the universal. </p>

<p>At its most intellectually fruitful that transpired in that wonderful group to which Friedrich von Hardenberg belonged, whose understanding of the popular and picturesque was so keen that he elevated it to something embracing humanity, something in which nationalism and universalism reside in close proximity. "Everything national," writes Novalis, "everything temporal, local, and individual can be transformed into the canonical and universal. Christ is a provincial re who has been purified into the universal." And he continues: "This individual shading of the universal <i>is its romantic element</i>. Thus every national and even every personal God is a universal that has been romanticized. Personality is the romantic element of each individual." Justice reigns in these remarks, and in them it is recognized that the canonical-universal is not empty rationalization, but purification and ennoblement; yet at the same time the individual and national are distinguished as the romantic element of personality within the universal, and so becomes the poetry of life. Which is the higher? Who can say? If the universal is the higher, more intellectual sphere, then the sphere of personality is perhaps the more intense, the more real. For centuries, certainly, that sphere of personality has included the martial domain. Yes, the sphere of blood is also in a horrible 

<b></b>

 way the bloody sphere—that, it seems, is its shading. War is romantic. Nobody has ever denied the mystical-poetic dimension that inheres in warfare. But today, it would be mere stubborness to deny that it is a romanticism utterly debased, a version of poetry disgustingly disred. If our national feeling is not to fall into disrepute or not to become a curse, it will have to cease being a vehicle for everything warlike and brawling; instead, corresponding with the nation's artistic and almost sentimental sides, it will be ever more unconditionally understood as the object of a cult of peace. (I hear feet shuffling again.) </p>

<p>Young men—please, not that tone! I am no pacificist, either of the raving or the oily sort. Pacifism as a world-view is no affair of mine, whether it be a spiritual vegetarianism or a rational-bourgeois philanthropy of happiness. It was also no affair of Goethe, nor could it have been; and yet he was a man of peace. I am no Goethe; however, albeit to a small degree and somewhat remotely, I am "from his family," as the Austrian poet Adalbert Stifter once put it, and I too am a man of peace, for that is the realm of culture, art, and thought; whereas in war, barbarism triumphs . . . not barbarism alone, let me concede. But as mankind stands at present, as matters stand today around the world, almost barbarism alone. Today, the world and its peoples are older and wiser, and the ages of epic and heroic activity are long gone. The attempt to return to them is a pointless resistance to the law of our age, a spiritual untruth. War is a lie, and even its outcomes are lies; no matter how much honor any individual brings with him into war, war itself is devoid of honor. To the viewpoint of anyone not self-deluded, war can only mean the triumph of everything common and brutal, of everything in the popular mind that is inimical to culture and thought, of a blood-orgy of egoism, destruction, and evil. </p>

<p> I ask you to acknowledge this truth. I am not saying it out of political ill will, nor to give offense to the memories of those among you who participated in the war, or saw their own blood and that of their comrades shed—memories that are inevitably holy, and that should remain holy. I am no Thersites, no malicious politician striving for power, one who revels in the shame and spiritual homelessness of his opponent whose ideals have collapsed. I know what blood is, what death is, what comradeship is. Admit it: from my lips there has never issued even a syllable of that paltry contempt for, in quotation marks, the "Great Age." Such contempt does not arise from a feeling of shame—for how could there be any feeling at all for someone to speak in that way? But among contemporary intellectuals even the most manly, the one whose entire body of poetry has been an austere cult of manliness, the one who only recently published a poem vibrating with the love of honor, with "the return of the dead," and with that hymn to "the armies, the heroes"—even he, pondering the reality of modern war, sees "nothing but many downfalls devoid of worth." </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>It escapes the creator's hand, rages despotically,  <br />
Deformity of lead and sheet-metal oh bars and tubes.  <br />
When false, heroic speeches from earlier times are repeated,  <br />
He laughs with rage who has seen his brothers crumbling 

<b></b>

 <br />
Like gruel or clods of dirt oh who has sat in the shameful  <br />
Uprooted earth like an insect . . .  <br />
The ancient god of battles is no more.</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">He is no more. He has degenerated into a hideous idol, and to bring him offerings has become a quixotic, pointless enterprise. Human decency and dignity demand that we push this bloody and paltry sovereign off his world throne and declare Europe a republic—insofar as the idea of a republic is bound up with that of a national cult of peace. </p>

<p>Republic—how do you like that word coming, as it does, from my lips? Not very much, to judge by certain sounds that, sadly, one is obliged to interpret as more shuffling of the feet. And yet—and here I differ from most of you—from childhood on that word has always been a trusted term of everyday usage for me. My home city was a republican federated state within the kingdom, as are all those that make up the Reich today. Nevertheless, I've never been a republican of the sort represented by Verrina, never a man of doctrinal purity, never a revolutionary in that sense—as you well know. As Novalis once said, and as I say together with him: "In our time, those who declaim against aristocracy as such and find no solution other than that of following the French model; those who think that any true republic must have representative assemblies, and peremptorily assert that a true republic exists only when you have primaries and party conventions, a directorate and councillors, municipalities and liberty trees—they are impoverished philistines with empty minds and arid hearts, literalists who try to disguise their shallowness and vacuity behind the colorful flags of triumphant fashion and the imposing mask of cosmopolitanism. <i>They deserve the reactionary antagonists that they have</i>, and in both groups the war between the frogs and the mice becomes perfectly embodied." That is how a romantic speaks. For the level of German romanticism, however much it differs from that of political Enlightenment, is for just that reason far above all obscurantism; and since genuine opposition is possible only between things on the same level, the hostility of obscurantism is perceived by romanticism as a final insult. Obscurantism, otherwise known under its political name, reaction, is sentimental crudity, insofar as it deceives itself and tries to disguise its brutish and unintelligent features "behind . . . the imposing mask" of feeling, perhaps of good German loyalty; and sentimental crudity so little deserves the noble and intellectually subtle name of romanticism that even the most inveterate romantic, in the present state of emergency, would become a supporter of political enlightenment, if only to defend romanticism against such shameless claims to it. When sentimental obscurantism becomes organized terror and disgraces the entire country with disgusting and crack-brained assassinations, no one can deny that we have indeed entered a state of emergency; and the hush, as I notice, which that allusion has produced throughout the audience in this hall, I know—I, who must fear that in my intellectual pursuit of freedom I have put weapons into the hands of obscurantism—I, let me say, precisely I, I know what I owe to this hush that has fallen over the room. </p>

<p>Let me say it openly: to the extent it's needed, my aim is to win you over to the side 

<b></b>

 of the republic, of what is termed democracy, and what I term humanity, an aim born out of repugnance (that I share with you) toward the humbug and murkiness associated with that other word. I am trying to enlist your sympathies for that cause in full view of this man and poet seated here before me, whose genuine popularity rests on the loftiest unification of folk and human elements. For I would hope that the face of Germany, at the moment so pitifully twisted and disred, might once more resemble his face, that head of an artist that shows so many features composing a picture of elevated probity, that it is intertwined for us with the German name. </p>

<p>Today, things in our land are truly strange and contrary to humane conventions. "A republic," Novalis once wrote, "is the <i>fluidum deferens</i> of youth. Wherever you find young people, you find a republic." And isn't it true that the thirst for freedom, the love of change, the high-minded impulse toward revolution, as much here as elsewhere, have been a natural prerogative of youth? Our students, our student associations, are by no means lacking in democratic tradition. There have been times when the nation and the monarchic-dynastic principle, far from coalescing into a unified idea, stood in irreconcilable opposition to one another; when patriotism and republic did not constitute an antithesis, but seemed one and the same thing; and when all the passion of noble youth supported that cause, unifying fatherland and freedom. Today, instead, it seems that young people, or at least critical masses of young people, have sworn an oath of eternal hatred for the Republic, without remembering what could once have been—for to remember those possibilities would surely mitigate such unconditional hatred. "Those were completely different circumstances," you will answer me, "but although the times have changed, we have remained loyal, and we recognize ourselves in the martyrs of those days, the noble-minded victims of demagogue persecutions. History does not repeat itself, and our hatred has become an independent life." That, I have to reply, is probably not really life, though it is only too true that history doesn't repeat itself, that indeed it can be inimical to life to think and feel only through historical analogies! It horrifies me to think of the dangers that attend such a game: it is a children's game, perhaps, to imitate the secret military restoration that Prussia undertook after the defeats of Jena and Tilsit. And what if the Republic, forced by necessity to deploy your monarchist secret organizations, had truth and justice on her side, just as you once had it on yours when struggling against the spies and secret agents of reaction? </p>

<p>"What does it really mean to be old? What young?" asks Novalis. "Young," he answers, "is where the future predominates; old, where the past prevails." Are we living, then, in a world turned upside-down? Young people today are partisans of the past, their hearts bent on a mechanical restoration of the old. Demagogic persecutions? Yes, in some cases it has come to that, albeit in the cause of defending, clumsily and inadequately, the new state, one that self-evidently cannot itself be the truly and genuinely new state, but only a poorly defined precondition and basis for that new state. Real demagoguery? Surely that is the shabby trick of exploiting our country's domestic and foreign woes to glorify a broken down past, doing so as well without having the faintest idea of the ways and means needed to restore that

 departed magnificence, or even how to fill that empty throne—in defence of which I hear feet shuffling, yet one more time. </p>

<p>To struggle against outward circumstances when they no longer harmonize with the inward, or when they represent only reality, not truth, is a praiseworthy sign of intellect. But it is absurd, and nothing more, to deny facts and not allow oneself to be shaped by a real world that has already become part of our shared mentality, even for those who deny or oppose it. I say to students, and to any citizens who may be here on this occasion, that today the Republic, democracy, are constituents of our mentality, and are such for us all, everyone, and to deny that is merely to lie. Until recently powers sanctioned by time and furnished with the authority that accrues to the magic of inherited fame, authority so compelling that it was only human to leave them in place and continue, even when they had degenerated into histrionics that turned such pieties into embarrassment—such powers ruled over us and constituted the state: the state lay in their hands, and it was their affair. It was an affair they conducted poorly, as is now clear, while we continued, indifferent to their doings, to conduct our own affairs, the affairs of the nation and of culture, as best we could. Indeed, a divorce gradually opened between the life of the nation and that of the state, a rupture of such breadth and profundity that it could no longer be tolerated and was bound to wreak havoc on both. We devoted ourselves to commerce, to art, to absolute thought—I will not say, "with composure," for our abstention from the political world had turned into a species of fatalist resignation that could hardly merit the expression "having confidence in"; yet we gave the appearance of having confidence in the state, as if we knew it were entrusted to the best hands—when, if we had known anything at all about the state, we would have known that it was in a very dubious condition indeed. Yet it was only human to do so, I repeat, given how everything had developed. But that time is now past. Those powers are no more. Fate has—we shall not use the triumphalist phrase, "swept them away," for we want to stick to facts—done away with them. They no longer reign over us, and after everything that has happened they will not do so again; the state, whether we like it or not, has fallen into our hands, and that means into the hands of every individual. It has become our affair, one that we now have to make good on, and that is just what the Republic is—nothing more. </p>

<p>The Republic has been our fate, in response to which the best form of behavior might well be "amor fati." That is not a very festive phrase; but then again, we're not talking about one of fate's minor details. So-called freedom is not fun and enjoyment, or at least that is not my view of it. Freedom's other name is responsibility, and saying that makes it clearer that freedom is also a heavy burden—and especially so for intellectuals. One may legitimately doubt whether many of the people who most vociferously called for freedom, before it became a part of our fate, ever sufficiently asked themselves if they were truly ready for it; for readiness has certainly not been apparent so far, and what the republic and so-called freedom will entail in terms of mental tragedy will become clear only later. A Russian writer, and hence the son of a land where the republican ideal reigned more completely than anywhere else prior to the recent convulsions, recently 

<b></b>

 spoke about the fate that awaited intellectuals in his homeland, a tense and dangerous existence in a way that we in the West can hardly imagine. "We had to look at life with a sense of strain," he said, "one that made us abandon an attempt to give it shape" (he meant: the pure pursuit of form); "and that has meant that we have less pure 'literature' within Russian than one can find in the languages of our western neighbors. . . . In the West there is a kind of literary culture, a literature at home in its own kingdom, if one can put it that way. . . . In our land the writer cannot confine himself to formal, aesthetic, or psychological observations. Those will not give him the tension that he needs for creation. He must aim higher. He strains to grasp and illuminate the entirety of life. Leo Tolstoy is not just an artist; he is also a historian, a critic, an aesthetician, a philosopher; all these aspects of his talent are paths that perennially point toward the temple of truth without ever actually arriving there. . . . Russian artists live with the recognition that literature doesn't have to reflect life as it is, to use that expression; it is a heroic form of action, a consecrated life, an overcoming of human weakness, a renunciation of and struggle against everything conventional. Under the burden of these tasks the strong become stronger and forge their own consciousness and genius. The weak, instead, collapse. Many Russian authors of considerable talent have collapsed in the course of their journey, and have given less to literature than they might have—pressured by the burden of tasks too large for them, tasks that exceeded their capacities. . . ." This quotation, which I've cited in a somewhat fragmentary form, can help us better understand the fate that awaits the intellectual within the mental world that has been opened up by the republic and why it is my view that some intellectuals in our country have been a bit careless in celebrating its creation. </p>

<p>But the republic is most certainly there. The "powers" have vanished and the state has become a matter that concerns us all. We have become the state. Yet this state of affairs is deeply loathed by significant portions of our young people and citizens; they don't want anything to do with it, denounce it on every possible occasion, and do so chiefly because it has not come about as a result of victory, or free will, or a national uprising, but as a consequence of our national collapse and defeat, an event inseparably bound up with impotence, shame, and domination by foreigners. "We are not part of the Republic," these alienated patriots say. "The Republic is foreign domination—to the extent that (and why shouldn't we too cite Novalis?) weakness is only the other side of foreign powers that are taking the upper hand, prevailing, setting the mark." True, all too true. But firstly, it is also true, as the poet Novalis says, that "man can ennoble everything, make it worthy of himself, only when he wills it" (a very true observation, and a fine one, too, and almost sly as well, a shrewd expression of adaptability for life); and secondly, to repeat it once more fiercely, it is not true, it is completely and absolutely untrue that the Republic as a psychological fact (I'm not talking here about constitutional niceties) is a creation born of defeat and shame. It is one born of exultation and honor. The Republic, my young friends, is a creation of that very hour that you want to preserve impervious to criticism or derogatory scorn, that hour when everyone was setting forth, inspired and ready for death—that was the hour when the Republic was born inside your breasts. "Holy homeland," so began a poem of that hour by Gerhart 

<b></b>

 Hauptmann, "how pale you suddenly seem!" But what actually grew pale at that hour, what was retreating and perceptibly vanishing into a fog were the powers that until then had constituted the state; and then it rose up within you, its life now resided within a community that was aflame, and all of you together were the Republic. And if today it stands humiliated (which I do not deny), then it would be cowardice to leave it in the lurch, instead of lending a helping hand, instead of supporting it and acting like the man who "makes it worthy of himself"; it would be cowardice to concoct every conceivable difficulty for the Republic, acting as if you were old men who no longer understood life and could only show tearful fidelity to the good old days. Let the question be posed again: does it show either intelligence or honor to deny inner truths? The Republic is just such a truth, one lodged within even those opponents who most loathe it, a truth that stands revealed even in the acts of violence bent on destroying it. Paradoxically, those miserable young men who have recently shattered the fine, wise head of an urbane public servant never realized that, in shooting a cabinet member, they were acting in accordance with that republican truth. </p>

<p>Young people and citizens, your resistance against the republic and democracy is a fear of mere words—yes, you bridle and rear against those terms like uneasy horses, and a superstitious nervousness robs you of reason as soon as they are spoken aloud. Yet they are only words, relativities, contingent forms, necessary tools, and to believe that they can only signify foreign nonsense is childish behavior. The republic—as if that were somehow no longer Germany. Democracy—as if that could not be a more welcoming home than some prattling, sabre-rattling, sword-waving empire! Have you listened to the <i>Meistersinger</i> lately? Nietzsche once made the admittedly dazzling remark that it was "aimed against civilization" and incited "the Germans against the French." But it is throughly democratic, and democratic to the same degree and in the same exemplary way that Shakespeare's <i>Coriolanus</i> is aristocratic. It is, I repeat, German democracy; its simple-hearted pomp and fervid romanticism prove that the pairing "German democracy," far from being unnatural or illogical, is as organically and seamlessly conjoined as perhaps no other pairing except one: "German people." </p>

<p> Have faith—faith in a general sense that at the outset need consist of no more than abandoning the prejudice that a German republic can only be nonsense and humbug, that it can only be defined as what Novalis calls "foreign powers that are taking the upper hand, prevailing, setting the mark," which is to say, weakness. A divorce between the life of the nation and that of the state, I said a little while ago, is unhealthy. But what should not be divorced can be usefully distinguished: for it should reassure us to recall that unequivocal certainty, that the life of the nation is far more powerful and more profoundly shapes life than any letter of public law or institutional arrangement. "German Republic"—the adjective forms a very strong part of that expression; and if the Weimar constitution should turn out not to be all that one would expect of a perfect constitution, one harmonizing the corpus of the state with its spirit and mind—but has such a perfect constitution ever really existed? One should not, in any event, attach too much importance to a written document. The real life of the nation, always and everywhere, towers far above it in every respect. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Once again I ask you: be on your guard against restless impulses. There is no reason in the world to think that the Republic is an affair of shady young Jews. Do not abandon it to them! Take the wind out of their sails, to use that expression beloved by politicians—the republican wind. The expression is in poor taste, but nevertheless a formula describing a way of acting which, if it were widely adopted, would lead to extremely positive results. For what are political parties actually arguing about? The welfare of the state. That depends not on whether a party is faring well, but on whether the state is faring well; and if every political party is clever in using the wind as the others, then all of them will have smooth sailing, which means the republic will as well—surely a desirable goal. To that end, advocates of the republic would be well advised to take the winds out the monarchists' sails—not allowing them alone to reach the public's ear when we are discussing matters of honor and disgrace, love and anger; and also to take the song out of their mouths, as Chancellor Ebert did so frankly and shrewdly with his decree on Constitution Day. He took the song "Deutschland über alles" out of the mouths of the "folk-ish" parties and effectively said that it was not at all their song, but at least as much his song, and henceforth he'd be singing it with a swelling chest. That is a new kind of singing contest, one over a song, and an excellent one at that! For it is self-evident that the nationalists will not want to stop singing it, and if it turns out that everyone is singing "Deutschland über alles" in unison then we will have the republic and have it faring forward with full sails. </p>

<p>These men at the head of the state: are they different from the rest of us, hostile strangers with whom there could be no understanding about the most basic matters, and who wish to exclude you from the Republic? Ah, they would be quite happy if you would come to lend them a hand, and they are Germans who use the German language and have been nurtured, like you, in German traditions and habits of thoughts. Some of them I know personally, such as President Ebert, for example. A fundamentally agreeable man, relaxed and yet firm. I have seen him at social events, dressed in his black suit, the gifted man who seemed a favorite of fortune, a citizen among citizens, calmly and amiably fulfilling his official duties; and since, on a few occasions, I have also been able to observe our late grand seigneur performing similar tasks, I have come to the insight, which I now want to advocate, that democracy can be something more German than an imperial opera gala. My children, my fellow citizens, things are better now—with my hand on my heart, I affirm that at bottom we are healthier, even with all the suffering and the political indignities in foreign affiars, than we were in the glittering times when the above-mentioned decorative talent represented Germany. It may have been entertaining, but it was an embarrassment, too—smiling, we used to bite our lips when we looked around and saw ourselves reflected in the expressions of others in Europe, hoping that they would not hold us responsible for the farce, which nevertheless they did; we wanted to hope that they would distinguish between Germany and its representative, something they were in no position to do. And so we turned back to cultural matters, saddened by the fatality destiny which had sanctioned tradition and the increasing divorce between the life of the nation and that of the state. A unified culture! Despite all the complaints of today, doesn't the possibility of harmony 

<b></b>

glimmer before us? Isn't the Republic only a name for the good fortune residing for the people in a union of state and culture? </p>

<p>What you will say in reply, I know very well. You will say: No, no, that is precisely what it is not. What does the German mind have to do with democracy, republic, socialism, even Marxism? Economic materialism, with its vile talk about "ideological superstructure," trash from the nineteenth century that is scorned even by children. What misfortune that it should come to be realized precisely when it has become intellectually moribund. And isn't that the same state of affairs for the other marvelous things which you, in a truly strange manner, are trying to excite German youth about? Can you see the stars over our heads? Do you know and honor our gods? Do you know who were the prophets of the German future? Goethe and Nietzsche, were they liberals? Are Hölderlin and George democratic spirits, in your quixotic opinion? —No, I won't say that. Of course, of course you're right on this point. My dear friends, you behold me crestfallen. I had forgotten about Goethe and Nietzsche, Hölderlin and George. Or is it perhaps that I remembered them, but in silence, as it were, while wondering whether it would more absurd to speak up for the Republic by invoking their names or to advocate a restoration under their aegis? Yes, asking that question can serve to help me in my crestfallen state. And I will go further and raise the question, whether we all (myself included! myself included!) have not underestimated the obstacles that our earlier state powers posed for the realization of German beauty; whether the new humanity, whose prophets were those great spirits and whose dream is planted in your minds even when you shrug your shoulders at the idea of democracy, will not find <i>on this soil</i>, the soil of the republic, more felicitous possibilities for coming to life than on the soil of the old state. . . . </p>

<p> Now you are getting angry! Indeed, if the presence of certain highly placed people didn't restrain you, you would shout at me: "What?! And what about your book? Your non-political, anti-democratic <i>Reflections</i> from the year 1918? Renegade, traitor, turncoat! You're eating your own words, becoming a mind-changer. Come down from the podium, stop trying to lay claim to powers of persuasion when you are denying your own views and displaying a lack of character." </p>

<p>My dear friends, I am going to remain here. I still have a few things to say that seem to me good and important; and concerning the betrayal discerned in my change of opinion, consider the possibility that the charge may not be fair. I'm not recanting anything. I am not retracting anything essential. I spoke my truth then and I'm doing so now. I could plead <i>Et nos mutamur in illis</i>, or note that I am not one of those saints who stand on pillars and stare at their navels, that I am unable to stare fixedly all my life at one and the same truth (for such self-hypnosis ends in death, a dignified death of historical petrification, and it is still too early for me to reach that state), or that I am constantly in need of new truth, as a new spur to life. But I will not adopt that line of defense. Instead I shall reply to you that in fact I am a conservative, that my natural task in this world is certainly not of a revolutionizing sort, but of a preserving kind—in the sense indicated with delicate force by Novalis in one of his aphorisms. "In certain periods it may be desirable that everything be dissolved in flux in order 

<b></b>

 to bring about new and necessary mixtures and a new and purer crystallization; but to the same degree it is also indispensable, if one is to alleviate the crisis and prevent total dissolution, that a stem can still survive, a nucleus around which a new mass can coalesce and reconstruct itself in beautiful new forms. What is solid must concentrate itself, in order to prevent an excess of caloric, the softening of bones, and dilapidation of the basic fabric." Now exactly this self-concentration of what is solid, such a provision against the destruction of the basic fabric—that is what my book did, and it was in this sense that it attempted to preserve some things. It was conservative—not in reactionary fidelity to the past, but in loyalty to the future; its concern was with the preservation of the stem and nucleus around which the new could coalesce and reconstruct itself in beautiful forms. The feverish state of revolution, though perennially necessary to life, cannot be considered an end in itself or something worth perpetuating forever; the same can be said of that state of self-concentration, seemingly inimical to the future, that follows. Everything depends on this: it must dissolve at just the right moment and find an equilibrium between what is solid and what is fluid. </p>

<p>How excellently Novalis comments on the two forces of life that are ceaselessly striving against one another today in Germany, and not only here. "Both," he says, "have great and compelling claims that must be advanced, driven by the spirit of humanity and the world. Both are indestructible forces lodged in the heart of humanity: <i>on the one hand</i>, the remembrance of the past, the devotion to institutions grounded in history, the love of memorials to ancestors and families rich in glory, the joy of being obedient; <i>on the other</i>, the entrancing feeling of freedom, the positive expectation that one can have a powerful effect on wider circles, pleasure in what is new and youthful, effortless contact with one's fellow citizens, pride in human equality, joy in one's personal rights and entitlements within the whole and that powerful feeling of being a citizen. One must not hope to destroy the other, for victory in such a struggle would be meaningless: for the inward capital of every kingdom does not lie behind walls of stone and cannot be taken by an assault." Isn't that a true formulation? I would like to call attention to the fact that, in these perceptive remarks, justice reigns insofar as the persuasive appeal of revolution is a little more expressly depicted than that of tradition. Yet Novalis does not believe in a "unification on the basis of common consciousness." In the view of this romantic with Catholic leanings, worldly powers cannot balance each other out on their own; only a third element, at once worldly and supernatural, can achieve that task—hierarchical thought, the idea of the Church. But how can such dreams speak to us? Or do we already know another "third element" that is "at once worldly and supernatural," that is to say, at once social and spiritual, humane and aristocratic, occupying a beautiful and dignified middle ground between romanticism and enlightenment, between mysticism and reason—that of Germany? My angry friends, wasn't it precisely that third element that I was defending in my book, an element under assault from left and right, more so from left than right—the element of humanity? </p>

<p>I feel myself entitled somehow, albeit in a very modest way, to take up this concept. For the thing itself was mine long before I knew its name, and I may even say that humanity, 

<b></b>

 for me, is not an idea deliberately chosen or thought through, but one rooted in experience. That may sound presumptuous, but one should recall that great things are sometimes found in microcosms, where their essential features can be grasped. I have revealed the secret of my heart, showing how the moving and grand experience of education stemmed, unperceived by me, from the autobiographical urge to self-portrayal; how the idea of education can extend to the social sphere and how humans, moved by social contact, can get sight of what is undoubtedly the highest stage of humanity—the state! When I was starting out in life, I would never have let myself dream that one day I would talk like that. But whoever does so, is a republican, even if he goes beyond that and also professes a political and entheistic faith such as that of Novalis. </p>

<p>Shall I continue the tale? The day came (an important day for me personally) when, in an open letter about Whitman, who had made a powerful impression on me through the noble translation of Reisiger, I proclaimed the unity of humanity and democracy; when I recognized that humanity is but a classicizing and old-fashioned term for democracy and that nothing hindered me from coupling that godlike name from Weimar and that of the thunderer from Manhattan, the man who had sung: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>
For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you, ma femme!<br />
For you, for you I am trilling these songs.
 </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">What transpired next was a rereading of the works of Novalis, seen from a new stage in my life and undertaken in connection with an artistic project I was at work on—that voluptuous thinker and highly intellectual dreamer, whose thoughts on the state and human community struck me as having such remarkable connections to the lyrical Americanism which had just impressed me that my talk for today was originally conceived as a lecture on that wonderful pair, Novalis and Whitman, and may well come to that in the end. To establish a connection between democracy, the Republic, and German romanticism—wouldn't that also entail making the former more acceptable to my bewildered and stubborn countrymen? </p>

<p>"Not only is it not enough," Walt Whitman says in his <i>Democratic Vistas</i>, "that the new blood, new frame of democracy shall be vivified and held together by political means, superficial suffrage, legislation, etc., but it is clear to me that, unless it goes deeper, gets at least as firm and as warm a hold in men's hearts, emotions and belief, as in their days, feudalism or ecclesiasticism, and inaugurates its own perennial sources, welling from the centre forever, its strength will be defective, its growth doubtful, and its main charm wanting." One can, I think, be helpful to what is new in Germany, aiding it to develop its "main charm," by linking it with a sphere and an era whose intellectual level was the highest ever reached in our land, one in which popular culture and high art, national and universal elements joined together, a moment that to a certain degree will always remain our intellectual home—that of German romanticism. </p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that Novalis, if we set aside his pious sentimentality for the Prussian royal pair, was strongly influenced by the French revolution in his perception of the state. "The state is too little publicized among us," he cries out. "There 

<b></b>

 ought to be criers of the state, preachers of patriotism. At present most citizens have only a very low, almost near to inimical relation to it." And he completes his thought in another passage: "One of the great defects of our states is that one sees the state too little. The state should be visible everywhere, and every person characterized as a citizen. Shouldn't uniforms and insignia be generally introduced? Whoever thinks such ideas trivial fails to recognize an essential characteristic of our nature." So acute a social sense is surprizing in a student of mysticism. In such sentences his definition of republicanism approaches civic militarism, and one might even call his conception of the state a form of romantic Jacobinism. "Only he who does not live within the state, in the sense that a lover lives within his beloved," he says sweepingly, and for the first time here he sounds that note of social eroticism which plays such an important role in Whitman's democratic conceptions, "will find his taxes a burden. For they are a very great asset. Taxes can be considered the salary of the state, the salary of a very powerful, just, clever, and amusing man. The need for a state is the most pressing need for man; to become and remain human he requires a state. . . . A man without a state is a savage. All culture springs from relations with the state; the more cultured a man is, the more he is a member of a cultured state." An entire world of hope for contemporary Germany can be discerned in that last sentence written a hundred years ago. Man, cultured as a member of a cultured state: that is political humanity. It is a union of the life of the state with intellectual and national life, a union which for so long we did not experience, but which once again we hope to see. In a word, it is the Republic. And what does it matter to us that Novalis, incidentally, was a mystical legitimist? Birth, he claims, is also a choice: anyone who doubts that cannot feel himself "alive in his own skin." But when he adds that a born king is better than one made or elected because even the best man cannot undergo such elevation without experiencing an alteration of character while one born to the purple will not become giddy or overexcited by new heights—well, we in Germany have had an example of the opposite taking place before our eyes for decades: constant giddiness, permanent overexcitement about his own status in one allegedly born to the purple. And precisely because his "status" was interpreted with a certain imaginative volatility, a certain poetic feeling of immediacy with the divine. Even when a king is a born king, even when he is not a crass mediocrity, the fact remains that monarchy, in our civilization, places impossible pressures on the human—so much so that it would be best to characterize it as inhuman, in a sense as yet insufficiently appreciated, at least as far as it bears on an individual's capacity for sympathy. </p>

<p>As for Novalis, in his ideas about kingship he constantly adheres to a democratic-republican point of view. For example, when he says there should be only one king "on economic grounds"; for if we did not need to economize, then "we would all be kings." In imagining a democratic state in which we were all kings (and that is just what noble republics have always been), he implicitly connects the ideas of freedom and equality; and to doubt the logical force of that connection is mere pettiness, and despite every attempt to prove that connection, it will never cease to hover before the eyes of mankind as the purest social ideal. Novalis calls that connection "the noblest 

<b></b>

 trait of a republic or of genuine harmony." That is a strong claim—for a royalist. Whitman, for his part, express himself thus: "This idea of perfect individualism it is indeed that deepest tinges and gives character to the idea of the aggregate." (Novalis: "This individual shading of the universal is its romantic element.") "For it is mainly or altogether to serve independent separatism that we favour a strong generalization, consolidation. As it is to give the best vitality and freedom to the rights of the state (every bit as important as the right of nationality, the union) that we insist on the identity of the Union at all hazards." He might be speaking of the German federation—or of a future European one. For we can foresee and predict that one day the same kind of friendly arrangements that have been reached between Bavaria and the Reich will appertain between national states and a higher European authority. In any case it is a German, or more generally speaking a Germanic instinct to cherish the idea of a state-shaping individualism, the idea of the community residing in the recognition of the humanity in each of its individual members, the human idea that encompasses the inner individual and the state, the aristocratic and the social, one as far removed from the political mysticism of a slave state as from the radical and anarchist individualism found in certain parts of the West: the union of freedom and equality, the "genuine harmony," or in a word: the republic. </p>

<p>"Would you have in yourself the divine, vast, general law? Then merge yourself in it." So speaks Walt Whitman, having a moment earlier said: "Nor is the aesthetic point, always an important one, without fascination for highest aiming souls. The common ambition strains for elevations, to become some privileged exclusive. The master sees greatness and health in being part of the mass; <i>nothing will do as well as common ground</i>." Very good; once again we have the unity of intellectual life and the life of the state, national culture as a culture of peace. But the word "aesthetic," near the beginning of the sentence, makes us aware that it is a question here of the "superman" promulgated by Nietzsche, a fatal character in several respects, the Nietzsche about whom Novalis prophetically remarked: "The ideal of morality has no more dangerous rival than the ideal of power; the ideal of the strongest, which has also been called the ideal of aesthetic grandeur (at bottom quite rightly; but as it is meant, most falsely). It is the maximum of the barbarian, and unfortunately in these days of an increasingly depraved culture it has attracted many adherents, especially among the greatest weaklings. By means of that ideal the human is transformed into an animal-mind, a mixture, a brutal joke that has a brutal power of attraction for weaklings." That is a striking comment. Above all it shows that democracy can possess the same psychological sensitiveness as its sharp-witted antithesis; and that is why I have come to this podium today, to demonstrate that point, and almost that point alone, that democracy can live on a certain plane, the same plane as that of German romanticism. </p>

<p>Nietzsche's hymn to the blond beast was anticipated and superseded by this passing remark from one of his German teachers. The case is no different with his critique of Christianity which, in a moment of literary irritability, he called "the one undying blot upon humanity." Novalis adopts a more a positive attitude towards this phenomenon—not out of hierarchical sympathies, but unequivocally in a democratic and a 

<b></b>

 revolutionary maximalist sense. "Absolute abstraction," he says, "the annihilation of the present, the apotheosis of the future or an actually better world: this is the core of the story of Christianity. . . . Christian religion is especially noteworthy for so decisively laying claim to and esteeming man's simple goodwill and his actual nature as it is, without cultivation. It stands in opposition to science and art and enjoyment as such. Its starting point is the common man. It animates the great majority of limited souls on this earth. It is that light that begins to shine in the darkness." (Tolstoy!) "It is the seed of all democracy, the highest fact of popular life." </p>

<p>Knowledge, it would seem, does not necessarily entail a Hamlet-like disgust with what is known and its own self-destruction in a disgust with knowledge itself, as in the case of Nietzsche. It can be affirmative. And Novalis, in such thoughts, is very close to Whitman, who once said that at the core of democracy, finally, there resides a religious element, and who shows himself to be in love with the words "en masse" in both his prose and his poetry. That is like Novalis, who turns it into nothing more and nothing less than a mystical formula. He dreams of human immortality, "en masse," and of a higher, composed human being, the genius. Plurality, he says, is genius. Every person who is composed of several persons is a person to the second power or a genius; and in that sense there were actually no Greeks, but only a Greek genius. He offers observations on living and thinking "en masse," and finds that if symphilosophy or thinking in common were possible, then a common will would also be possible, <i>the realization of great, new ideas</i>. "Community, pluralism is our inmost essence, and perhaps everybody has a certain share in what I am thinking and doing, just as I have in the thoughts of other human beings." "Just as philosophy, by means of systematic thinking and the state, strengthen the powers of the individual with the powers of humanity and the world as a totality, so poetry, with respect to life. The individual lives in the whole and the whole in the individual. From poetry stems the highest sympathy and shared activity, the most intimate community of the finite and infinite." <i>Salut au monde!</i> Did you know that there was such enthusiasm for democracy, such an ecstatic philosophy of socialism? But the state as poetry, philosophy, and inspiration—after all, such a state is more life-enhancing than the one we had before, and the one Novalis depicted in the following terms: "No state has become more like a factory than Prussia in the period since the death of Friedrich Wilhelm I. Such a mechanical administration may be necessary for the physical health, invigoration, and ability of the state; but when it is administered entirely in this way, then its essential features will fall into ruin. The principle of the older and celebrated system was to bind everyone through self-interest to the state. Shrewd politicians kept their focus on an ideal of the state in which the state was as self-interested as its subjects, yet both were so skillfully bound together that each assisted the other. Great effort was expended in this political squaring of the circle. But naked self-interest seems to be utterly immeasurable and anti-systematic. It has refused to accept any barriers, though barriers are what is required by any state administration. This open acceptance of petty egoism as a principle has brought about terrible damage here, <i>and the seed of the revolution in our days lies nowhere else than here</i>." That is not raving, it is sober and realistic and for us an all too familiar truth. And even 

<b></b>

 less is it poetry or mysticism, rather than the healthiest, strongest, and manliest good sense, when Novalis cries out: "It is plainly better in republics, where the state is the chief concern of every individual, and each one feels that his existence and needs, his activities and viewpoints are bound up with that of a widely diffused society, and that his life is bound up with that more powerful life, so that he broadens his imagination and his understanding to encompass larger issues, exercises them, and almost unwillingly he forgets his narrow self-interests for the enormous whole." </p>

<p>Is this the voice of a German romantic? This democratic pluralism forgoes any metaphysical claustrophobia, and it has an almost American freshness, as well as pedagogical suitability—any well-constituted youth will prove receptive to it. More generally, concerning the essence of romanticism there are popular preconceptions and sheer moonshine that one must seize every possible opportunity to refute. Poetry and art, romantic poetry at least, <i>German</i> art—isn't it a truism that they are dream, simplicity, feeling, or better yet "moods"? What the devil do they have to do with intellect which is something, much like the Republic, that is more an affair of shady young Jews, that should be viewed with contempt, that should be an object of patriotic scorn. But what if one could be convinced that German romanticism was a strictly intellectual discipline of art and mind? "The seat of real art," says Novalis, using terms that have something to do with democracy, "<i>is in the understanding</i>. The mind constructs according to a specific conept. Imagination, wit, and power of judgement are required only from it. Thus <i>Wilhelm Meister</i> is completely a work of art—a work of the understanding." Folk-ish professors will take offense at citing such a sentence. With them, temperament so outweighs understanding that they would never be ready to grasp that romanticism almost exactly means modernity: modernity in the sense that the word is given by Schiller when he distinguished sentimental poetry as modern in comparison with naïve poetry, or in the sense given it by Merezhkovsky, when he explains that in Russian literature, after the unconscious creativity of Pushkin, there arrived with Gogol something that one would have to call a creative consciousness, a creative critical power. </p>

<p> Another example of the unreliability of certain dyed-in-the-wool preconceptions! Where does romanticism stand in relationship to modern commerce, to the spirit of international trade? Is it, after all, pretty shrewd? Is it, after all, like the democratic Whitman, who calls the complicated business genius of our day "not the least among the geniuses"? Novalis replies: "The mind of commerce is the mind of the world. It is absolutely the grand mind. It sets everything in motion, binds everything together. It awakens cities, countries, nations, and works of art. It is the mind of culture, a perfecting of the human species." </p>

<p>Gentlemen, without a doubt, that is democracy. Indeed, it is even progress—no matter what connotations that word carries for someone steeped in German romanticism. A perfecting of the human species: Novalis conceives that idea in the sense of that Christian radicalism which means "absolute abstraction, the annihilation of the present, the apotheosis of the future." For the sake of that idea he violently separates God and nature, and becomes a dualist to the extent that he proclaims God has nothing to do with nature, and instead is nature's goal, that with which it must one day harmonize. 

<b></b>

 Nature will become moral. "Nature cannot be static: it is continually being absorbed into the sphere of morality. One day there will be no more nature. It will gradually be absorbed into the sphere of culture." Talk about progressive utopianism! Talk about a bold antithesis to the view of nature and history, full of pseudo-inexorability, with which one brilliant mind has recently terrified us; in that view, "humanity" is yet again only an empty word, something inconceivable, and history nothing more than the relentlessly unfolding decline, following inexorable laws, of biological entities that men have called cultures. "What if the unchanging laws of nature were an illusion, or were highly unnatural?" asks Novalis. "Everything follows a law, and nothing follows a law. A law is a simple, easily comprehensible relationship. For our own convenience we try to discern laws. . . ." For our scientific convenience, indeed; and because we are lacking in love, are imperious, and seek irrefutable certainty. And also because of our self-complacency, an impulse to betray the human and arrogantly to side with nature against mind and humanity, in the name of nature telling humanity self-satisfied dogmas and thereby appearing wonderfully brazen and aristocratic. But with such treatment the problem of aristocracy, plainly entailed within the opposition between nature and mind, is not even glimpsed, to say nothing of being solved, while the flight into nature can turn into an unaristocratic form of snobbery. I would like at this point, which strikes me as an appropriate one, to interpolate my view of Spengler's recent work. His <i>Decline</i> gives evidence of enormous power and strength of purpose; it is knowledgeable and stimulating; it is an intellectual novel that is highly entertaining, and its musical structure is not its only feature that recalls Schopenhauer's <i>World as Will and Idea</i>, a comparison that places the book on a very high level. But at the same time I have my own democratic opinion about it: I find its attitude false, arrogant, and "convenient" to the point of extreme inhumanity. It would be different if this attitude were a disguise for irony, as I at first supposed, or if its prophecies were really a polemical means of offering a defense. It is legitimate to make a prophecy about civilization—Spengler regards civilization as the biologically inevitable end-product of every culture, including the West—not with the idea that it will actually transpire, but with the idea of preventing it from transpiring, a form of intellectual exorcism: and that was what I thought he was doing. But when I learned that he wanted his prophecies of petrification to be taken literally and dead seriously, and that he was urging young people to act accordingly, to stop wasting time by devoting themselves to culture, art, poetry, and learning, and instead to turn to what is the only possibility for the future, the one thing that they had to desire if they were to be able to desire at all, which is mechanism, technology, business, or if need be politics; and when I perceived that what he offered to the yearnings and wishes of the human being was actually a cold, satanic fist, "the law of nature," then I turned away from such hatefulness. I have put the book out of my sight in order not to have to marvel at such a harmful, deadly work. </p>

<p>Law! Truly Walt Whitman understood better than that severe mind what is the real essence of law. "The law," he says, "the law over all, and law of laws, is the law of successions; that of the superior law, in time, gradually supplanting and overwhelming the inferior one." And he adds: "And, topping democracy, this most alluring record, 

<b></b>

 that it alone can bind, and ever seeks to bind, all nations, all men, of however various and distant lands, into a brotherhood, a family. It is the old, yet ever modern dream of earth, out of her eldest and her youngest, her font philosophers and poets. . . ." Old and ever new: the morphologist of history knows and even speaks of this dream, but he speaks of it without any love and with a false inevitability. From his scientific viewpoint the dream of humanity is simply something that appeared once by chance and that will return by the dictates of a mechanical and inhuman law, a phenomenon of mind, fatal and banal in its predictability, a dream on which even the people who are dreaming it should not pride themselves, for all have dreamed it in their turn. To deny the idea of humanity is banal callousness, something that escapes his learned gloom; just as it also escapes him that a single work born of love, such as Mahler's <i>Song of the Earth</i>, which merges lyrics from ancient Chinese poems with the most advanced musical structures of the West into a humane and organic unity, overturns his entire theory about the radical incommensurability between different cultures. What, then, is humanity? Is it the sum of all men now living or that of all who have ever lived and will live—always and everywhere hard to delimit against the animal world? No, it is something inmost and more essential; to use Novalis's words, it is "the higher meaning of our planet, the star that connects this individual to the world above, that he turns up toward the sky." That may well seem like trifling poetry to the science of historical morphology; but beneath its basilisk eye we shall not flinch from making it our own. </p>

<p>Hidden in the insipid rigidity of the viewpoint that has been contested here is a latent politics that can be drawn out. It is not that of the German romantic, Novalis, whose ideas perhaps here as well are in harmony with those of that lover of mankind across the ocean. As for war, it is not that he rejects it in on pacifist grounds. But, he says: "What would it be like if a closer and more various connection and contact were the historical aim of war; if it stirred a Europe that has been sleeping until now; if Europe wanted to awaken again; if a <i>State of States</i>, a new political science, stood before us!" The state of states! Is he thinking romantically and hierarchically? But Novalis says in a secular spirit: "International law is the beginning of universal law and a universal state." And he is one of the earliest to say what everyone today is shouting from the rooftops: "States must finally realize that the achievement of all their aims is possible only through collective measures." </p>

<p> There is nothing for it but to admit that all this is political enlightenment, is unambiguous democracy—straight from the lips of a knight of the blue flower, one who moreover was a born Junker, from whom one would sooner expect mediaeval or feudal love of honor, asserted with weapons, than such modernities. But what does he actually say about knighthood? My fellow students, he speaks of it with open contempt. "It was the <i>point d'honneur</i> of chivalry that first introduced a ridiculous formality between human beings. Etiquette is the death of all <i>free humanity</i>, a mixture of Asiatic elements, the meanness of slavery and despotic arrogance, with Christian humility." He is a profound psychologist: and that too has something to do with a republic. Even more closely connected to the idea of a republic is his phrase about "free humanity," which is really only another, nonpolitical term for it—and yes, an expression of love, indeed of 

<b></b>

 being-in-love. I use that last, more limited but clearer expression to come to another trait that Novalis and Whitman deeply share, one that unmistakably constitutes the root of their humanity and their socialism. It is love—not in some pale, anemic, ascetic, pitiful sense; but in the sense of that obscene root-symbol that Whitman chose as the title to that raging and referent sequence of songs, in which lines glisten, such as these: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>
Come I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior,<br />
I will tell you what to say of me,<br />
Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover.
 </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Or elsewhere: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on them, and in the contact and odour of them, that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleases the soul well,<br />

 </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">And what does Novalis say? "Dancing, eating, talking, shared observing and working, being together, listening to each other, seeing, feeling, etc., all these are conditions and occasions and even functions of the power of the human being of genius. It is <i>amor</i> that unites us. Desire lies at the bottom of all the aforementioned functions. The truly voluptuous function (sympathy) is the most mystical, the almost absolute, the one urging to totality of union (mixing), the chemical." Earlier I called him a voluptuous thinker; here we have an example of that, one that also illustrates the radicalism of his social psychology. But it is when he speaks of sympathy, the mystical-chemical function or sympathy with the organic, that he most approaches Whitman's erotic and all-embracing notion of democracy. Sympathy here is that sensuality that sets in very early and is responsive to the touches of desire, and it makes Novalis perceive that even looking is already an elastic pleasure: the need of an object is the result of the impulse to touch, at a distance. It is here that he meets up with Whitman. Sympathy is something like biology as a state of being-in-love; such is Novalis's quest to assert and experience the organic and the animal, even in domains where it is not ordinarily found: in the air, where the combinations of nitrogen and oxygen are not simply chemical but "purely animal," and in fire, which has the nature of an animal and is a consuming force kat' exjochvn. Non-organic nature, and even plants, animals, and human beings, must be seen as excrement of the organic and animal. Man: the most complicated, developed excrement of a highest and most refined fire. And Novalis, that wide-eyed dreamer, broods over the phenomenon of sexual desire, of the yearning for flesh touching flesh, of pleasure in the naked bodies of human beings, something that this mild-mannered man ascribes to origins in cannibalism. "Might it not be a repressed desire for human flesh?" But right next to this expression of erotic mysticism and skepticism one finds another in which desire is elevated to devout inspiration, to religious humanity: "There is only one temple in this world and that is the human body. Nothing is holier than 

<b></b>

 this lofty form. To bow before it is to pay homage to this revelation in flesh. When you touch a human body, you are touching heaven." </p>

<p>"The curious sympathy, one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body." This is a line from that magnificent poem filled with love's sacred insanity, which begins: "I sing the body electric." Its ninth section is an anatomical hymn that is delivered in the exuberant, naïve, catalogue-like style of this wild artist, a devout and orgiastic celebration of the human body in its organic structure. </p>

<p>"In a curious way that no one would guess," the surgeon Wilhelm Meister recounts, "I was already far advanced in my knowledge of the human form because of my theatric career; since, all things considered, the physical man plays the main role in that world—a handsome man, a handsome woman! . . . The freer conditions under which a company lives make the members more familiar with the true beauty of unveiled limbs than would any other environment. Various costumes even require that which is usually veiled to be exposed. . . . And so I was sufficiently prepared to pay steady attention to the anatomical lectures that taught the external features in detail; the inner features were likewise not unfamiliar to me, since I had always had a certain intuition about them." Shrewd and candid terms. Goethe's adventurer in the human realm regards the free, sensual, erotic sphere of the theater as a felicitous preparation for the study of that humanistic discipline we call medicine which, like all its sister disciplines, is a variety and an inflection of the same lofty and deeply interesting theme that one can never consider variously or many-sidedly enough, for it is the human being. Wilhelm, of course, will be led on to further adventures and opportune researches into pedagogy, sociology, and politics: but for these fields, too, aren't the "freer conditions" that revealed to him the beauty of the human form a felicitous preparation? "O I say," Walt Whitman calls at the end of his anatomical love song, "these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, O I say now these are the soul!" That is Hellas—born anew out of the spirit of American democracy. There is Goethe in it; and the best, most forward-looking, and most instructive parts of Nietzsche; and Novalis's reverence for the temple. "Was it doubted that . . . the body does . . . fully as much as the soul? And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?" That is the third kingdom of religious humanity, and over it presides Eros—as king? No, that would smack of the middle ages and chivalry. But Whitman would like it if the youthful god were made president of this new kingdom. </p>

<p>In this context, which remains a political context, and with all due caution and respect, I will venture to speak of the particular sphere of feeling that was alluded to in my last remarks: that zone of eroticism, in other words, where the generally accepted law of sexual polarity proves inoperative, superfluous, and where what we see linked in passionate communion is like with like, maturer masculinity with admiring youth, in which this masculinity may idolize a dream of itself, or young masculinity see a model for itself. Society, which for a long time has contained this without acknowledging it, either supressing it from awareness or prudishly rejecting it with abomination, is gradually beginning to relax the taboo of denial and disrepute imposed on this phenomenon, 

<b></b>

 to look it more calmly in the face, to articulate its many-sidedness in properly human terms. It can indeed signify enervation, degeneration, sickness, and in such cases one may wonder whether punishment or humane care is the best way to address it. But it is impossible at a deeper level to assign to the sphere of decay a complex of feeling that can contain what is most sacred and culturally fertile. Whoever thinks about nature and its laws, as did Novalis, as something that is to be overcome, will find the charge of un- or anti-naturalness a trivial one right from the start; Goethe, moreover, already rejected this common argument with the remark that the phenomenon was thoroughly within nature and humanity, rather than outside of it, as it has made its appearance in all times and peoples and can be aesthetically explained by the fact that, objectively speaking, the masculine is the purer and more beautiful expression of the human ideal. Schopenhauer put it very similarly. . . . But the dimension of this remarkable subject that I want to bring to attention here is the political one, something that is also not lacking. Isn't it said that the war, with its experiences of comradeship in blood and death, of hard and exclusive masculinity in its way of life and atmosphere, has powerfully strengthened this erotic realm? The political attitude of its believers is generally nationalist and militarist, and it is said that relationships of this sort form the secret cement of monarchist leagues, indeed, that an erotic-political emotion, modelled after certain loving friendships of antiquity, has been behind specific terrorist acts of our days. And yet Harmodius and Aristogiton were democrats; and it cannot be said that what seems to be the rule today stems from some more fundamental law. The most powerful, modern counter-example is the poet of the Calamus songs, Walt Whitman: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>

Resolv'd to sing no songs to-day but those of manly attachment,<br />
Projecting them along that substantial life,<br />
Bequeathing hence types of athletic love.
 </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">With these songs, this bodily-athletic love, Whitman sought to "make the continent indissoluble," to "create divine magnetic lands," "inseparable cities with their arms about each other's necks, by the love of comrades, by the manly love of comrades." Eros as statesman, even as a creator of states, is an old, trusted idea, which in our times has recently been skillfully advocated anew; but it is basically nonsense to seek to make its cause and political expression a monarchist restoration. Its cause is rather the republic—, in other words, the unity of state and culture to which we give this name; and although no pacifist in the vegetarian sense, he is by his very nature a god of peace, one who, <i>between</i> states, seeks to establish "without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument the institution of the dear love of comrades." </p>

<p>In my attempt to convince you, I did not want to ignore or leave unnoticed a sphere of sensibility that undoubtedly contains or can contain elements important for state and culture. Health? Sickness? Careful with those notions! They are the most difficult in all of philosophy and ethics. Whitman's worship of boys, since it formed only one fine province of the all-embracing kingdom of his phallically healthy, phallically brimming inspiration, was certainly something healthier than the love for Sophie that beset poor 

<b></b>

 Novalis, who found it shrewd to love a sleeping form in order to prepare a convivial resting place "for the night," and whose Holy-Communion eroticism lets the irritable lecherousness of the consumptive break through in an uncanny way. The Calamus Songs and the "Hymns to the Night": they are as different as life and death or, when Goethe's definition of these concepts is right, as different as the classic and the romantic. "Sympathy with death": certainly that formulation doesn't quite capture all the wonderful, glittering essence of romanticism; but it delimits its deepest and highest moments well enough. The youthful Flaubert knows this when he says that "what the poets of our time feel in the very depths of their being" is what he calls a "deep love for nothingness," a love for the "empty sockets of the yellowed skulls and the tombstones covered with moss"; and in the case of Novalis, that sympathy with the organic that we have spoken about is so mixed together with that other, seemingly antithetical sympathy that never have disease, death, and desire been so closely linked in one man's poetry. Life itself as disease—the thought is not remote to him, for in organic matter he discerns an instinct for self-destruction, the hallmark of all disease; death and desire for him are one and the same function—namely, the chemical, pressing toward total unification. And from that idea stem his evil associations with the bridal bed. </p>

<p> What do such excesses have to do with the pure and freshly smelling, primitive healthiness of the singer of Manhattan? Nothing, no doubt; and if "sympathy with death," while plainly not the whole of romanticism, is plainly nothing other than romanticism, it should be wildly alien and repugnant to the prophet of athletic democracy and free states lovingly holding their arms about each other. And yet it isn't. He was familiar with and cherished it, this sympathy. His love for the ocean would betray him, even if he didn't betray himself through this confession that the waves of the idle ocean, on whose eternity he rests, murmur to him, "death, death." For love of the sea is nothing other than the love of death. And it is in the Calamus Songs—precisely there, and not by chance there—that the old romantic formulation, "death and love," that immortal and magical formulation that will never become trite, openly becomes the dominating theme of Whitman's unfettered verse: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>
Give me your tone therefore, O death, that I may accord with it,<br />
Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, and are folded inseparably together, you love and death are.
 </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">"What indeed is <i>finally beautiful</i> except death and love?" The question is put right there, and it includes the statement that love of beauty, love of perfection, is nothing other than love of death—a claim that has been a commonplace of aestheticism ever since Platen's poem, "Tristan." If you like, all poetry is disease: for at bottom it is inseparable from, irrevocably found up with, the ideas of love, beauty, and death—even that primeval, athletic poetry of Walt Whitman, which enabled us a moment ago to establish a relationship between democracy and aestheticism. But isn't poetry life for the sake of life? If poets love the sea for the sake of death, will somebody reply that it is from the sea that life stems? Or is this the truth: sympathy with death is more than a 

<b></b>

 vitiated form of romanticism only when death is not set up as an independent spiritual power opposed to life, instead of being a consecrating and consecrated force that is absorbed within life? Interest in death and disease, in decadence and the pathological, is only an expression of interest in life, in man, as the humanistic discipline of medicine proves. Whoever takes an interest in the organic, in life, will also take an interest in death. Perhaps a Bildungsroman will strive to show that the experience of death is ultimately an experience of life, that it leads towards the human. </p>

<p> Novalis once expressed a profound insight into morality and biology, one freighted with knowledge about desire and ethics, freedom and form. It runs: "Our elements are driven toward deoxidization. Life, instead, is forced oxidization." Death, in this remark, is perceived as fascination and seduction, elements driven toward freedom, formlessness, and chaos; life, instead, as the whole content of duty. Was it this insight that led the man who dreamed of an eternal bridal night to his ideas about the state and a fine community of human beings? </p>

<p>No intellectual metamorphosis is more familiar to us than the one in which begins with sympathy for death and ends with a decision on behalf of service to life. The history of European decadence and aestheticism is rife with examples of this breakthrough into the positive, into the people, into the state—especially in the Latin countries. Many of you will be familiar with Maurice Barrès, the impetuous advocate for the Rhineland. He was written a book with a title reminiscent of Novalis, <i>Blood, Desire and Death</i>. He wrote another with an equally telling title, <i>The Death of Venice</i>. He has been a member of parliament, the president of a patriotic society, a probing theoretician of nationalism, a shaping force of the nouveau esprit in France, and a chronicler of the war. I have said that he is an example; but I have to think a little before I describe him as a model. His "breakthrough" has been of an extremely French sort—as well it should be. But it would not be appropriate for us to imitate him, and if it didn't sound a bit nationalist, yet again, one might be tempted to say only a Frenchman could believe that nationalism is really life. </p>

<p> Let us drop this question of the French. A people who had the wit to invent nationalism will also have enough wit to be done with it. As for us, we shall do well to attend to our ourselves and our own—yes, let us use the word with restrained pleasure—national affairs. I will invoke for you yet again a term at once somewhat old-fashioned and bright with youthful allure: humanity. That term represents a German middle-ground, the human-and-beautiful which our best intellectuals have dreamed of, mediating between aesthetic isolationism and a degrading downfall of the individual into the general; between mysticism and ethics, inwardness and the state; between a deathly negation of ethics and civic values and the all-too-easy ethics of philistine rationalism. We are paying homage to its explicit legal form, whose meaning and aim we have defined as the unification of political and national life, insofar as we flex our still unaccustomed tongues to the cry: "Long live the Republic!"</p>

<div class="fn">
<p>"On the German Republic" first appeared in the November, 1922, issue of <i>Die neue Rundschau</i>, vol. 33 no. 11, 1072–1106, and it is this publication which serves as the basis for the translation given here. <i>Die neue Rundschau</i> was essentially a house organ for the S. Fischer publishing house, Mann's own publisher, and the November issue was dedicated to, and celebrated, the sixtieth birthday of the dramatist and poet Gerhart Hauptmann. On its first appearance the essay was titled "Thomas Mann for the German Republic" ("Thomas Mann für die deutsche Republik") and only when it was issued as an 

<b></b>

 independent book the next year did it acquire the title by which it has been known and discussed ever since, "On the German Republic." I have deferred to that now extensive tradition in rendering the title here. The essay, now without the "Foreword," next appeared in <i>Bemühungen</i> (Exertions) (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1925). The 1925 text then became the basis for further republications in Thomas Mann, <i>Gesammelte Werke in zwölf Bänden</i> (East Berlin: Aufbau-Verlag, 1955), vol. 12 (without the "Foreword"); Thomas Mann, <i>Gesammelte Werke in dreizehn Bänden</i>, second edition (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1974), vol. 11 (with the "Foreword"); and <i>Thomas Mann: Aufsätze, Reden, Essays</i>, ed. Harry Matter (East Berlin: Aufbau-Verlag, 1983–1986), vol. 3 (without the "Foreword"). Still more recently it been twice reprinted, but this time based not on the text of the 1925 <i>Bemühungen</i> but on the 1922 original periodical publication, in Hermann Kurzke and Stephan Stachorski, eds., <i>Thomas Mann Essays</i> (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1993–1997), vol. 2, and <i>Große kommentierte Frankfurter Ausgabe</i>, vol. 15, <i>Essays II: 1914–1926,</i> edited by Hermann Kurzke (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 2002). The essay was first translated into English by Helen Tracey Lowe-Porter, in Thomas Mann, <i>Order of the Day: Political Essays and Speeches of Two Decades</i> (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1942), albeit in incomplete form. One extensive passage, omitted in Lowe-Porter's translation, was translated by David Fernbach in Michael Maar, <i>Bluebeard's Chamber</i> (New York and London: Verso, 2003). Other missing passages are restored here for the first time. </p>

<div class="fn">
<p>A few points remain to be made about Mann's numerous quotations and their sources. Mann, in assembling quotations from the German poet Novalis, used an edition of his <i>Sämmtliche Werke</i> (<i>Complete Works</i>) edited by Carl Meissner, 3 vols. (Florence &amp; Leipzig: E. Diederichs, 1898), complemented by a fourth volume, <i>Ergänzungsband auf Grund des literarischen Nachlasses</i>, edited by Bruno Wille (Florence &amp; Leipzig: E. Diederichs, 1901). This edition is both extremely rare and, by more recent standards, defective in ordering the many fragments. Reference to it is made by the abbreviation <i>SW</i>. For many years the standard edition of Novalis's works has been the <i>Schriften</i> (Writings) edited by Paul Kluckhorn and Richard Samuel, 3rd edition (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1977–1999), with the materials that Mann used all drawn from vols. 2–3. Reference to it is made by the short title, <i>Schriften</i>, followed by the volume and page numbers. All translations from Novalis into English are my own. While good translations of some of Novalis's prose have recently appeared in English (see Margaret Mahony Stoljar, ed. and trans., <i>Novalis's Philosophical Writings</i> [Albany: State University Press of New York, 1997]), these include only a small number of the works cited by Mann. To cite them would lead to readers wondering why some citations were given in a published English translation and others not, creating pointless confusion. </p>

<p>Mann's quotations from Walt Whitman were all drawn from Hans Reisiger's edition of <i>Walt Whitmans Werke</i>, 2 vols. (Berlin: S. Fischer, 1922), excellent translations that have remained the standard rendering of Whitman in the German-speaking world. They are referenced by the name Reisiger, followed by volume and page numbers. For English-speaking readers, reference is made to Walt Whitman, <i>Complete Poetry and Complete Prose</i>, ed. Justin Kaplan (New York: Library of America, 1982). Reference is made by the abbreviation <i>CPACP</i>, followed by the page number. For authors other than Novalis and Whitman, I referenced both standard German editions and their English-language equivalents wherever possible. Finally, frequent reference is made to the <i>Große kommentierte Frankfurter Aufgabe</i> (the <i>Large Frankfurter Edition with Commentary</i>), henceforth <i>GFKA</i>, followed by volume and page numbers. This 38-volume edition of Mann's works, essays, letters, and diaries, begun in 1998 and schedule for completion in 2015, is changing the entire landscape of Mann studies and is invaluable. The two volumes (of six) of Mann's essays edited by Hans Kurzke are major scholarly achievements.  </p>

109.2 lecture … Frankfurt] Mann refers to a lecture that he gave in Frankfurt on 1 March, 1922, one that formed part of the Goethe-Week celebrations held there. The text is reprinted in <i>GKFA</i> 15.1,<i> Essays II</i>, 482–91. It has not been translated into English. The evening before, on 28 February, he gave another lecture on "Goethe and Tolstoy," this one attended by Reich President Friedrich Ebert (1871–1925; president of the Weimar Republic, 1919–1925) and the German dramatist Gerhart Hauptmann (1862–1946). Mann is telescoping the two events into one here. (For the text of that lecture see <i>GKFA</i> 15.1, 376–420.) He is also playing a bit loose with dates: Hauptmann would celebrate 

<b></b>

 his sixtieth birthday on 15 November, 1922, more than a month after Mann delivered this lecture on 13 October. (Although Mann had indeed contributed a short piece to a Festschrift commemorating Hauptmann's birthday, one published already on 3 August, 1922; for that text see <i>GKFA</i> 15.1, 513.

Both were murdered by right-wing extremists. Erzberger had been a member of the Reichstag or parliament since 1903. In 1918 he headed the German delegation that signed the Armistice, and in 1919 became finance minister and endorsed the treaty of Versailles. Forced from office in 1920, he was murdered while in Baden the next year. Rathenau was the son of a prominent Jewish businessman and became a leading industrialist in his own right. He was appointed Minister of Reconstruction in 1921 and Foreign Minister in 1922, and in the latter role he negotiated the Treaty of Rapallo, which recognized the Soviet Union.

Those agreements were reached in August 1819 between representatives of various German states and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, part of a program of restoration undertaken after the defeat of Napoleon. The agreements called for forbidding student organizations, control over the intellectual content of lectures delivered at universities, and censorship of the press. Application and enforcement of the "demagogue persecution" varied from state to state, but was especially intense in Prussia. The Agreements were rescinded after the revolutions of March, 1848. </p>

<p>114.31 to deploy your monarchist secret organizations] After the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II on 9 November, 1918, the fledgling Republic found that the armed forces were insufficient or incapable of defending the state against popular insurrections led by left-wing groups in Munich and Berlin. To restore order, the state and the army turned to Free Corps (Freikorps), organizations of former soldiers recruited and led by former officers, some overtly monarchist. They were composed of demobilized lieutenants and N.C.O.s, university students and adventurers, patriots and drifters. Furnished with army weapons and coordinated by the Supreme Command, they restored order first in Berlin in January, 1919, then in other cities during the following months. However, their tactics involved the outright murder of some left-wing leaders, such as Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. Though officially disbanded in early 1920, relics of the Free Corps staged the unsuccessful Kapp Putsch in March that year, while others soon drifted into the Sturm Abteilung (S.A., or Storm Section) of the fledgling Nazi party, formed in 1921. </p>

<p>129.30 the third kingdom] In German: das dritte Reich. The notion of a "third Reich" or "third Kingdom" has a long history that goes back all the way to early Christianity. (For a more extensive history, see <i>Armin Mohler, Die konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918–1932: ein Handbuch</i>, 3rd edition [Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1989.] Mann himself uses the term in works that date from as early as 1912 (<i>Fiorenza</i>) to as late as 1932 ("A Speech to Workers in Vienna," "Rede vor Arbeitern in Wien"). In his usage, it is a counterpart to "a German middle-ground," the idea that Germany can provide a point of synthesis for various dichotomies that preoccupied Mann when he was younger (life and art, south and north, etc.). See note to 120.37–38. The phrase <i>das dritte Reich</i> or the third Reich starts to acquire its more familiar connotations in 1923 when it is used as the title to a conservative political book by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck (Berlin: Der Ring, 1923); thereafter it is adopted by various conservative groups and acquires the ideological density especially associated with its adoption by the Nazis. </p>

<p>130.7–11 Goethe, moreover … human ideal] In a conversation about "Greek love" with Friedrich von Müller on 7 April, 1830. Friedrich von Müller (1779–1849) served as state-chancellor to the grand-duchy of Saxony-Weimar-Eisenach and was a close friend of Goethe; his record of their conversations was first published in 1870 (Friedrich von Müller, <i>Goethes Unterhaltungen mit dem Kanzler Friedrich von Müller</i>, ed. C. A. H. Burckhardt [Stuttgart: J. C. Cotta, 1870]) and has been republished many times since, though it has never been translated into English. "Now the conversation turned to Greek love …. He developed his view that this aberration stemmed from the fact that, from a purely aesthetic viewpoint, man is much more beautiful, superior, and more perfect than woman is. Such a feeling, once arisen, could easily change into something animal, something purely material. The love of boys is as old as humanity, and as a consequence one could say that it lies <i>within</i> nature, even if it remains opposed to nature."

<p id="lead">The following pages were written in the good summer days of this year 1922 for a special issue of the <i>Neue Rundschau</i> devoted to Gerhart Hauptman and, before seeing print, were delivered as a lecture held on an October evening in the Beethoven Auditorium in Berlin. Their delivery and their appearance in print aroused considerable controversy: less for their actual contents, which could not surprize anybody, than because their contents came from precisely this author. I soon had to be pleased when critics declined to rummage through my intestines on practical grounds, critics who otherwise damned me for "going over to the other side," for "a sudden change of mind," for "breaking" with my intellectual and political past, and when they omitted to charge me with having been ordered to the task or simply exploited. It became an almost universal opinion that it represented an altered understanding, a change of outlook that was of a surprising, confusing, and even frivolous sort. </p>

<p>That universal opinion is mistaken—an assurance, one I have not shrunk from repeatedly giving in private, that I now ask to stand good for here. I know of no change in my understanding. I have perhaps altered my thoughts—but not my understanding. Thoughts, however sophistical it may sound, are always only means towards an end, tools in the service of understanding; and especially for the artist it is much easier—it is less so for the immovable custodians of public opinion—to allow oneself to think or speak differently than before when it is a matter of asserting the same understanding in altered times. Already on one occasion I have noted that Goethe's maxim, that only observers have scruples, not actors, should almost be reversed in the case of the artist: he, instead, is scrupulous as an actor, as a doer, which is say as an artist; for art is the sphere of pure mind and for the artist it possesses all the dignity of observation, while thought, instead, he considers only a dialectical means; he doesn't rate it very highly in its own right, as "truth," and instead is inclined to practice observation as a form of action. Thus, when the author of these pages sometimes sustains thoughts that differ from those found in his book, <i>Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man</i>, it means only that there is a contradiction between the thoughts, not one within the author. He has remained the same, unified in his essential being and understanding, and so much so that he can reply both to those who praise him for having changed and to those who charge him with a betrayal of Germanness: to encourage the republic merely extends the theses advanced in the <i>Reflections</i> into the contemporary situation, without any rupture; his understanding is unchanged, and he in no way renounces that work's theme: that of German humanism. For its sake the author has allowed himself, with 

<b></b>

 all patience, to be branded a reactionary, just as today he will survive being labelled a Jacobin for its sake. His double stance of opposition should at least bear witness to the independence of his conscience and shield him from the charge that, due to some weakness of character, he has yielded to the influence of some circle or environment or that he is changing his sails to suit the winds. </p>

<p>When writing this, I thought that I would be able to help a little by acting, and that it would become significant action precisely by virtue of the fact that it was I who was undertaking it; I thought that I would be giving an example precisely by virtue of the fact it was I, the notorious and fully accredited "bourgeois," who was decisively coming down on the side of the republic; and it was the same fantasy that enabled me to play the role of the rabble rouser and to rehearse what I had written before a live audience in an auditorium. All too plainly, I was mistaken. For the press prematurely seized on it and treated it after its fashion, a poor and very imprecise fashion in some cases—only God knows to what extent its treatment was the result of accident or malicious intentions. There it was reported that I had said the republic was not the result of wartime collapse, but of upheaval and honor, and that was the end of it. What I really said, instead, can be represented here yet one more time. I assigned the birth of the "republic" not to1918 but to 1914. It was then, in that hour of national awakening, that the republic established itself in the hearts of young Germans; it was then that something happened which determined the shape of what I understand by the term "republic"—as I was not going to offer a toast to the republic before I had even defined it—, not as something that actually existed, but as something that was to be created. The attempt, perhaps undertaken with inadequate means—the attempt to make an intellectual contribution to that indispensable creation, to infuse that infelicitous form of state, one still lacking in citizens, with an ideal, a soul, the spirit of life—the attempt, as I review it even after having received a hundred blows to the body, merits no disdain.</p>

<div class="fn">
<p>"Foreword [to 'On the German Republic']" was first published in the newspaper <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, vol. 44, no. 586, on 24 December 1922, and it is this printing which has been used for the translation given here. In that venue it appeared with other works by Rainer Maria Rilke, Lovis Corinth, Arno Holz, and Bertholt Brecht under the general title: "The Old and the Young: Stands on the Generation Gap" ("Die Alten und die Jugnen: Stellungnahmen zum Generationenkonflikt"). It was then reprinted together with "On the German Republic" when the latter was produced as an independent book, or brochure, a few months later in early 1923 (<i>Von deutscher Republik</i> [Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1923]). When "On the German Republic" was next reprinted in 1925, in a collection of essays titled <i>Bemühungen</i> (Exertions), the "Foreword" was not included with it, and since then it has only twice been reprinted in Thomas Mann, <i>Gesammelte Werke in dreizehn Bänden</i>, second edition (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1974), vol. 11, and <i>Thomas Mann: Aufsätze, Reden, Essays</i>, ed. Harry Matter (East Berlin: Aufbau-Verlag, 1983–1986), vol. 3. Happily, it too has been included in the <i>Große kommentierte Frankfurter Ausgabe</i>, vol. 15, <i>Essays II: 1914–1926</i>, edited by Hermann Kurzke (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 2004). It has not been previously translated into English. </p>

In <i>No More Parades</i>, Ford Madox Ford presents a fictionalized account of how English poetic forms were used to counter the effects of mental crises during the First World War. The main character, Tietjens, attempts to write his way out of a nervous breakdown by speedily composing a sonnet: "He said to himself that by God he must take himself in hand. He grabbed with his heavy hands at a piece of buff paper and wrote on it in a column of fat, wet letters  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>a <br />b <br />
b <br />
a <br />
a <br />
b <br />
b <br />
a, and so on."</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Tietjens writes the sonnet in "two minutes and eleven seconds" on "buff" paper with "fat," "wet" letters, the upright letters themselves taking on the traits of a healthy body. Immediately after, the broken-down bodies of soldiers enter the room, returning from battle, "[t]heir feet shuffled desultorily; they . . . held in unliterary hands small open books that they dropped from time to time." 

<b></b>

 Tietjens's empowered "literary" hands act of their own volition, writing the sonnet as he barks orders simultaneously to men around him, careful "never to think on the subject of a shock at the moment of a shock."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> This passage demonstrates how Captain Tietjens's hands, in their practiced exercise of writing in English meter, order his mind so that he can continue successfully to give orders to the men around him—"unliterary" men whose own "feet" shuffle aimlessly. Military feet and metrical feet are joined here, in the automatic composition of a <i>line</i> meant to discipline and protect. </p>

<p>Paul Fussell and Samuel Hynes have each discussed how the "literariness" of the First World War promoted the use of typical romantic images in soldier poetry, each critic careful to point out the privileged class education available to the officer-poets who produced the now famous poetic images of the First World War.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Though these critics show how popular anthologies like <i>Palgrave's Golden Treasury</i> and the <i>Oxford Anthology of English Poetry</i> provided comfort for soldiers on the front, they neglect to discuss how soldier-poets had been trained, prewar, in the particularities of English poetic craft and how these practices—the ability to compose a sonnet in two and a half minutes—not only provided comfort for soldiers on the front but, in some cases, directly assisted them in recovering from psychological trauma. The rich and unexamined archive of prosodic manuals from this era demonstrates how would-be poets were charged with the task of learning correct English poetic form with the same rhetoric of shaping and disciplining young Englishmen that accompanied the most rigid classical pedagogies. For instance, R. F. Brewer's popular manual <i>Orthometry, or, The Art of Versification and the Technicalities of Poetry</i>, which Wilfred Owen owned, encourages poets to understand metrical laws to "at least accustom the beginner to the proper use of his <i>feet</i> before trusting him to untried <i>wings</i>" and praises how English poetic forms have become successfully imprinted in the minds of all Englishmen:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The study of our poets has now happily attained a footing in the curriculum of nearly all our public schools and colleges; while the millions who attend our elementary schools have suitable poetic passages indelibly impressed upon their memory in youth. All but pessimists anticipate good results of this early training upon the tastes and re-creative [<i>sic</i>] pleasures of young England of the twentieth century.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">It is not only the "re-creative" pleasure of writing poetry (read both as "recreation" and that which that can be created again and again), but also the importance of "training" that emerges in an examination of these manuals. Though Fussell points out the common discipline of classical education among officers, the disciplinary function of prewar and wartime English poetic teaching also haunts much First World War soldier poetry and gives us new perspectives on how shell-shock psychiatrists during the First World War used the already imprinted disciplines of writing poetry in English to "incorporate a notion of discipline on the one hand and therapy on the other."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The idea of using writing as a form of therapy and mental ordering relied on the assumption that education had done its work before the war; traditional poetic forms had been successfully inscribed into an officer's memory and could be used as an aid in his rehabilitation.

  </p>

<p>The phenomenon of wartime neuroses during the First World War forced psychologists to fashion theories that grasped the centrality of <i>practice </i>to psychic healing. In instances of neurasthenic trauma, psychologists were often charged with the task of realigning linguistic ruptures, manifested by expressive stammers or even complete aphasia. This paper juxtaposes first the methodologies employed by two doctors on staff at Craiglockhart War Hospital; I discuss the interdisciplinary techniques of Wilfred Owen's therapist, Captain Arthur J. Brock, a classicist and sociologist, with the talk-therapy of Siegfried Sassoon's doctor, the anthropologist Dr. W. H. R. Rivers. For Brock's patients, ordered activities provided a reconnection to a unique kind of social world and formed a methodology of healing through which shell-shocked officers were efficiently "cured" so that they could return to the front. The success of these "ordered activities" was particularly remarkable for linguistic disorders. Composing in meter, for many patients trained in poetic craft, became an empowering method of controlling time—a therapeutic practice that coupled the expressive aspects of Freudian psychotherapy practiced by Rivers (narrating traumatic experiences in order to "move through" them) with sociological ergo-therapy, or the "cure by functioning" promoted by Brock. </p>

<p>The most visible examples of this "writing cure" at Craiglockhart are found in the pages of the hospital magazine <i>The Hydra</i> and in the poems of Wilfred Owen. Poems, articles, and drawings in <i>The Hydra</i> demonstrate how patients were both aware and suspicious of the artificiality of re-education through forms of physical, social, and mental ordering, and yet at the same time were relieved and, essentially "cured," from many symptoms of neurasthenia by the structures that those therapies provided. I read this tension between attraction and repulsion to neurological ordering as a step toward understanding twentieth-century suspicions about <i>poetic</i> ordering through a psychological and historical framework other than those provided by traditional accounts of modernism. This paper examines Brock's methods as essentially metrical—that is, temporal and spatial ordering have prominence over narrative and/or expressive models—to show how the therapeutic measures of meter were used as a method of reordering a neurasthenic patient's chaotic psyche. Ordering time and prosodic ordering at Craiglockhart provide a previously unexamined manifestation of many wartime and postwar anxieties about form; soldiers at the hospital were re-educated to embrace forms and orders which had become meaningless to them while at the same time they were encouraged to express their mistrust of all forms and orders. Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, who were patients of Rivers and Brock respectively, both composed poems at the hospital that deserve rethinking within these new psychotherapeutic metaphors of poetic production: the continuous supplementary aspect of Freudian narration, on the one hand, and on the other the active metrical exercise of fitting fragments of experience into a predetermined order that connects the writer, through the history of form, to the social world.

<p>Rivers was among the many medical officers interested in new treatments for neurasthenia, or, as he preferred to call them, anxiety and substitution neuroses. Anxiety neuroses interested Rivers because they required that the patient attempt to "lift" the repression in [from] his mind by a process of confronting, narrating, and therefore "metabolizing" the memory that, by his methods, had been "thrust out of [the patient's] consciousness."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  This ability to renarrate in order to recontextualize an event was the unique ability of officers; Rivers expressed boredom with the men of the ranks he had treated at Maghull War Hospital, recording that "the characteristic of the uneducated person is that the mental outlook of adult life does not differ appreciably from that of childhood" (<i>RWN</i>, 368). Rivers believed that officers possessed a higher faculty for expression in general due to their education, but he also understood that this upbringing formed part of a culture of repression in British society that required men to "move on" from difficult memories without confronting or expressing them. This was especially the case for officers who were expected to repress fear in order to lead a regiment confidently into battle. This culture of repression, for Rivers, was the root cause of many nervous disorders—repression that had "germinated in the nursery and [been] perfected in the English public school" (<i>RWN</i>, 359). Though Rivers criticizes this flaw in English society, it is this very ability to express traumatic memories in well-crafted English narratives that attracted Rivers to the highly-educated officer-patients at Craiglockhart. </p>

<p>Before transferring to Craiglockhart, Rivers worked closely with Dr. William Brown at Maghull, where both doctors developed their therapeutic methods. Brown's idea, largely adapted from Freud, of <i>autognosis</i>, was based on the new belief that anxiety neuroses were based in pathogenic associations between past events and recent ones and the resulting confusions concerning the meaning of these experiences. The job of therapy was to expose these links and clarify these misunderstandings. Brown emphasized "long talks between the physician and the patient." The physician's task, among others, was to help the patient sort out any <i>temporal dislocation</i> between past events and current events through redirecting the patient's attention toward "a neglected aspect of his experience," in an attempt to transform traumatic memories into tolerable, and even pleasant, images (<i>RWN</i>, 369). Rivers gives the example of a patient who witnessed the violent death of his friend—a shell had blown the man's body apart. The doctor points out that his friend's quick death, though gruesome, was painless, and that his friend is now free from harm, thus allowing the patient to "dwell upon his painful memories" by casting them in a new (albeit grimly positive) light. Rivers's patient Siegfried Sassoon, published four poems in <i>The Hydra </i>in 1917; "Repression of War Experience" (the title of a 1917 lecture by Rivers) was not, however, among them:<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>   </p>

<p class="continued">This ironic narration shows how repression is harmful, despite society's belief that "it's bad to think of war." The poem ends, predictably, with the subject running mad among the trees.  </p>

<p>Sassoon describes the order of daytime treatment and "wholesome activities" at the hospital as "elaborately cheerful. Brisk amusements were encouraged, entertainments were got up, and serious cases were seldom seen downstairs," but he later contrasts these organized amusements with the chaotic and uncontrollable aspects of the war neuroses.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> Day and night are contrasted as interludes controlled by either the medical staff or by the anxiety neuroses, but never by the patient's own repaired will. </p>

<p class="continued">"Muttering" or "suddenly crying out" is calmly transcribed into "scientific terminology" that the doctor simply, passively "notes down." Night is full of incommunicable and sudden terror, shouted to the reluctant audience of other sleepless soldiers, whereas day-time communication is encouraged and inscribed on the doctor's notepad, diagnosed, and renarrated into a cheerful reinscription of the experience in the patient's mind. In Sassoon's passage, however, the daytime feels eerily unsettling. It is as if reality exists only in the inevitable nightly descent into chaotic memories, away from the soothing questions of the doctor and his nodding encouragement.  </p>

<p class="continued">The moment that the incident occurred is less powerful than its haunting and endless return, mocking the deliberate military march of any disciplined order and seizing the patient's mind with an unordered "stampede" of nightmare. Sassoon's dramatization of the doctor's attempts to "remove repressions" feels ironically inefficient in comparison to the patients' disorienting collapse of past into present and the resulting dislocation of expression manifested bodily by the stammer. Rather than "re-enacting" an experience for the listening doctor, experiences are involuntarily "re-enacted" for the now livid audience of the dead and are, through their haunting recurrence, performed nightly on the stage of the patient's neurasthenic psyche. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Time's collapse was manifest, for many patients, in the inability to control or adequately manipulate speech—what Sassoon calls "the stammering of dislocated speech." As a symptom of trauma, the stammer indicates a disruption of linear time, a doubling back into the repressed past of the traumatic experience, and the inability of the patient to locate himself in his present environment—both temporal and spatial rupture. Speech is always located "elsewhere," but the metrical grid could provide both spatial and temporal orientation. The metrical aspect of recovery is evident in Sassoon's 1918 letter to Robert Graves, in which words cram together nonsensically until the appearance of Rivers soothes the patient into almost mocking, yet ordered, double dactyls: "Sleeplessexasperuicide, O Jesu make it stop! / But yesterday afternoon my reasoning Rivers ran solemnly in, / With peace in the pools of his spectacled eyes and a wisely omnipotent grin." Not only does Rivers's appearance coincide with dactylic regularity in this line, but Sassoon, as a patient, transforms his self-loathing into self-appreciation (albeit ironic) through Rivers's guidance into the patient's "grey" unconscious: "And I fished in that steady grey stream and decided that I / After all am no longer the Worm that refuses to die. / But a gallant and glorious lyrical soldjer." A "lyrical soldjer," however, who resents how his mind is "crammed with village verses about Daffodils and Geese" and begs his doctor to free him of his misery: "O Rivers please take me. And make me / Go back to the war till it break me."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  This passage seems almost a case study for Captain Brock's assessment of speech-disruption among trauma sufferers: "The various affections of speech tend to run into one another; moreover, along with the stammer of the tongue we not infrequently observe a distinct 'mental stammer'."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Here, we see how Sassoon's writing runs together the unhealthy letters, cramming the dactylic "sleeplessness," "exasperate," and "suicide" into a stammering and traumatic metrical and material affect on the page. </p>

<p>Brock describes the officer's unique relationship to disrupted time and speech in his postwar book <i>Health and Conduct</i>: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The shell-shock patient is out of Time altogether. If a "chronological," he is at least not a historical being. Except in so far as future or past may contain some memory or prospect definitely gratifying, or morbidly holding him, he dismisses both. He lives for the moment, on the surface of things. His memory is weak (amnesia), his will is weak (aboulia), he is improvident and devoid of foresight. He is out of Space, too; he shrinks from his immediate surroundings (geophobia), or at most he faces only certain aspects of it; he is a specialist <i>à Outrance</i>.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Brock's analysis shows how the patient is both immovably moored in time and space—unable to move forward through language so repeating sounds in a loop—and how the patient somehow unconsciously chooses his extreme detachment from both time and space. His thoughts cannot move forward, nor can his speech. The patient must be re-educated to see himself in time as part of a continuum, and to reconnect with the social world and his surroundings to face all aspects of his experience. Highly coordinated activities at the hospital were Brock's solution for treating this "inco-ordination."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The patients' responsibility for the management of their own time through 

<b></b>

 physical and social activities would, in Brock's reckoning, force the patients to actively and metrically order their mental chaos in new contexts of time (the five-beat line of a poem, a first-person narrative or short-story, a play) and space (a diagram of the city, a lecture on botany, a description of local museums). </p>

<p>Writing metrical poetry was encouraged but Brock warned against the dangers of "art for art's sake," where art becomes a kind of drug that separates the patient from the social world, an extreme form of <i>outrance</i>. To counter this artistic tendency, artists and writers in the hospital were encouraged, indeed, required, to "produce beautiful objects of immediate and practical utility," with the hopes that Brock could eventually "orchestrat[e] the work of all our artists towards cooperative programmes of regional or civil scope" (<i>REA</i>, 35). Objects of art, then, were subject to discipline just like any other "activity," though as an exercise, writing was specifically a form of communication with a larger community—of other patients, of possible patrons (hospital magazines raised money for the hospital, and patients were charged for copies), and an imagined community of literary connoisseurs and other publishing poets. Meter's role as part of this connective tissue, hearkening back to prewar poetic forms, was perhaps the most important. The ability to manipulate poetic language into English poetic forms created a connection with the larger community of English writing and of Britain in general. In the hospital, even the poetic self was part of the collective history of the region and country; he was not isolated, but participated in his heritage, in the preservation of his own past and future, and in his own rehabilitation. Learning these tools relied on discipline and labor; what Brock called "ergo-therapy" reconnected the soldier to the social and physical world—to the structure and communities of English and to Britain—from which he had become severed through the unnatural mechanizations of modern warfare.  </p>

<p>On March 22, 1917, Wilfred Owen quoted from memory a long passage from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <i>Aurora Leigh</i> condemning "many tender hearts" for stringing "their losses on a rhyming thread." Owen confesses to his sister that he, too, has perhaps "sow[ed] [his] wild oats in tame verse"; he adds, "this passage winded me, yea wounded me."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In a long letter to his brother one month later, we see Owen relying on rhythmical form despite his reluctance to unconditionally endorse the traditional English poetic forms, forms which haunt many of his letters. Owen laments the lack of a drum-beat as he describes to his brother the sensation of "going over the top:"  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I kept up a kind of chanting sing-song:<br />
Keep the line straight!<br />
Not so fast on the left!<br />

Not so fast! </p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The four lines each hold three strong beats, but each wavers with extra syllables as if to show how difficult it is to keep this line, any line, "straight." Owen seems to identify corporeally with the rhythmic form, as if making the drumbeat himself, in his mind and voice, will encourage his feet and those of his men to move forward. It is clear, however, that the only lines that allow the quatrain's movement are those crammed with syllables around the beat; that is, the iamb and anapest of "Nót so fást / on the Léft" lifts the line up and hurries it through the unaccented syllables of the words "on the" so as to keep time with the line, just as "Stéady ón the léft" slows through "Stéady," shaking the pronunciation of the word so that it becomes unsteady. The near three-beat exclamation "Not so fast!" shows the poet and the soldier's inhibitions about moving forward and seems to pull the small poem back into itself—a retreat from metrical feet altogether. The small quatrain indicates the simultaneous forward and backward instincts of cresting the top of the trench into No Man's Land, but also shows the poet-soldier's wavering line; Owen cannot keep the line straight, nor can the (poetic) line line keep him (mentally) straight. Owen composed this particular letter from the casualty clearing station in straight lines following standard issue ruled paper, after suffering the shell blast that would manifest itself as neurasthenia.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> </p>

<p>Owen arrived at Craiglockhart on June 23, 1917 and met Dr. Brock in his office for the first time four days later. Brock recognized that Owen was a "devotee" of writing, but his poetic community needed to extend outside the hospital. Two instances show how assignments by Brock directly influenced Owen to associate survival with his ability to manipulate poetic form, (metrically, as he had been taught); in the hospital, his poems took up issues of feet, rhythm, music, and sound as primary and secondary themes, especially in the war poems. First, Owen was assigned a report on Outlook Tower in Edinburgh—a tall medieval house adapted as a center for sociological studies. On July 14, 1917, Owen read the following notes to his doctor: "I perceived that this Tower was a symbol: an Allegory, not a historic structure but a poetic form. I had supposed it to be a museum, and found it [a] philosophical poem: when I had stood within its walls an hour I became aware of a soul, and the continuity of its idea from room to room, and from storey to storey was an epic."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Owen connects the spatial allegory of poetic form to the temporal allegory of narrative structure—an order for wholeness. Owen acts out Brock's desire that the patients participate in the larger community but through his reconsideration of poetic form he connects to a specifically literary community; indeed, through Owen's poems we are able to perceive poetic form as a kind of historic structure.  </p>

<p>Brock saw the mechanizations of modern war as inherently unnatural and sought to reconnect his patients to their social as well as natural environments. The land, of course, was Britain, and geographic knowledge, an ability to map out one's surroundings, to navigate, was an important part of "reconnecting to one's environment" as well. Brock was also a classicist and translator of Galen; he composed an article about the Anteaus myth for <i>The Hydra</i>, writing "His story is the justification of our activities. When we come here the first thing we do is to get on our legs again. . . . Thus we come 'back to the land' in the most literal, as well as the more metaphorical sense."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Like 

<b></b>

 Owen's assignment to write about Outlook Tower, Brock saw Owen's concern with poetic form as one way that the neurasthenic soldier could reorder his understanding of himself in time and of himself in the larger context of English writers. Owen simultaneously worked on a presentation for the newly created "Field Club" at the hospital and on his second literary assignment for Brock, the composition of a poem about the Anteaus myth.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Owen approached the composition of his Anteaus poem as a spatial problem. He wrote to his mother, "On the Hercules-Anteaus Subject—there are only 3 or 4 lines in the Dictionary. So I shall just do a Sonnet"(<i>CL</i>, 475). By the time he wrote to his cousin Leslie Gunston a few days later, the poetic form had progressed from a sonnet to a larger blank verse epic, what Owen calls "a strong bit of Blank." This lengthening of form from finite to continuous in both the Outlook Tower essay and the Anteaus fragment demonstrates Owen's reconnection to a possible literary, or heroic, future. In addition, by sharing the poem with his cousin Leslie, Owen reached out to his prewar poetic community.  </p>

<p class="continued">The sound patterns of this early version of the poem, too, foreshadow a different kind of connective tissue on the level of the phoneme. Each season seems to have its own sound sown within the line; the <i>"</i>er" sound of line one; the soft "i" and "n" of line two; the "ah" and "er" of line three.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  These alliterative effects are signaled by metrical stresses as well, alternating within Owen's stringent blank verse. The "blood of June" that "glutted the heart" of Anteaus can be read as a memory of the blood of June in the battlefield Owen has escaped. These powers, drawn from the seasons of the earth, are only available to Anteaus when his feet are firmly planted on the earth, to the roots of words and to their geographies of phonemes and inner structures, not just the metrical forms imposed on language from without. The "stringency" and discipline of winter must come before the "ardour" and "invincible" spring of the young and hopeful soldier until finally the blood of June battles triumphs. In a letter written the same day to his mother, he quotes a longer excerpt from the beginning of the poem, describing how Heracles was "baffled" by the strength of his opponent, and fixed his feet firmly to the earth. The line: "And yet more firmly fixed his graspèd feet" shows how the strength of the ten syllable line is bolstered by the diacritical mark promoting an artificial second syllable in "grasped" (in a later version, Owen revised this word to "grasping"). The res in the poem struggle through their feet—Heracles's feet are "firmly fixed," though the poem's metrical feet are not, jostling between iambs and trochees. The poem's feet are more like Anteaus, pulled away from the firm ground of English poetic form: "How, too, Poseidon blessed him fatherly / With wafts of vigor from the keen sea waves, / 

<b></b>

 And with the subtle coil of currents — / Strange underflows." The word "coil" is also promoted to two syllables here, expanding a word that means contraction to lengthen the line arbitrarily to ten syllables. The poet is wrestling with unruly feet themselves, the beginning of a metaphor for time and measure that appears in many of his later war poems and, most significantly, in his substantial writing for <i>The Hydra. </i> </p>

<p>The most notable activity Brock prescribed for Owen was the editorship of <i>The Hydra</i>. Most shell-shock hospitals had small papers or gazettes that published hospital activities, though none was quite as literary as <i>The Hydra</i>.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Not only did <i>The Hydra</i> provide the kind of connection between officers that Brock longed for—the journal was entirely patient-run—it specifically demonstrated the indelible forms of education that each officer carried. Through its frequent allusion to literature, classics, and the arts, the magazine allowed the officers to reconnect with both their social class and with their past communities of school and home. Already relying on the forms of classical knowledge shared by most officers, the first editorial states: "The name of the journal will indicate what we wish its character to be: many headed—many sided" (<i>H</i>, 28 April 1917). The name <i>Hydra </i>was not only a reference to Hercules's labors, but also a reference to the fact that the hospital was a former hydropathic sanitorium, dubbed "the hydro" by its wards. Through the articles published in <i>The Hydra</i> (especially during the four months when Wilfred Owen was editor), we come to understand how writing at Craiglockhart was a part of the therapeutic process of organizing neurasthenic time.  </p>

<p>For instance, the September 15, 1917 issue, under Owen's editorship, includes an eerie cartoon of Captain Rivers, drawn by "one who has not seen him" (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Rivers is dressed as an Oxford tutor and stands on a pedestal of books while four officers sit in the background passively waiting for the wand-bearing wizard to cure them.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The soldiers show no sign of functioning or taking control of their own activities; they sit slumped in chairs as if in a trance. A scroll in Latin swirls above Rivers's head: "Styx Acheron Phlegethon Lethe Cytis Avernus," but upon closer examination we see that the doctor is reciting, the scroll leading ominously back to his mouth. The pun on "rivers" is clear in the translation from the Latin; these are the names of "rivers" Virgil and Dante encounter in <i>The Inferno</i>. Rivers stands on the stage of literature with a book ignited in flame in his left hand, asking his charges to confront their own personal hell of traumatic memories, as if to show how, despite all the discipline and authority in their education and their military training, there will always be a chaos threatening to ignite at any moment. There is, in the postures of the slumped men, the sense of complete passivity; despite the mesmerism of the "wizard" doctor, there seems a distinct possibility that these men are broken beyond repair. In this way, the cartoon subtly questions the military and therapeutic orders the men are expected to follow in the hospital. The cartoon, then, shows how education and psychotherapy are perhaps inadequate forms of discipline and self-preservation in the face of neurasthenic "hell." This scene replicates and mocks the forms of classical education to which the officers were privileged, while at the same time showing how they are dependent on these same forms in the hospital.

<p><i>The Hydra </i>had received enough financial support by September 1917 that the editorial committee pleaded for more submissions and a different cover for what was to be the "new series" in November 1917 (the month of Owen's discharge). "We make a last appeal for an attractive cover design—a promising futurist thing, if you will; anything but a future promise" (<i>H</i>, September 29, 1917). We may read a grim humor in his phrase, "future promise." In the fantastic new cover (<a href="#2"> 2</a>), the rigid military forms of the original cover picture (with its austere looking officer standing in front of the square hospital building) are blasted away by the fluid drawing of a soldier propelled backwards by a shell blast shaped like the multi-headed hydra, both a classical reference and a gesture to the former use of the hospital. The hospital is barely visible, perched up on a hill in the far right corner, and the scorched earth below resembles the pocked moonscape of Owen's poem "The Show." The soldier has lost hold of a book; in both this drawing and the cartoon about Rivers, literature's ability to heal is dramatized and, ultimately, questioned. It is as if, in some small way, these artists demonstrate that literary form cannot possibly hold the horrific and fantastical visions of a world blown apart and scorched by war. </p>

<p>Owen attempted to steer the magazine toward his own literary aspirations by begging for more verse submissions in every editorial. Though Owen printed two of his own poems in the magazine (albeit anonymously), his editorials provide indirect mediation on coming to terms with the different requirements of therapy at Craiglockhart, and show how Owen's own poetic writing might be read for "marks" of neurasthenic disconnection from time's proper marching. In many places in the magazine we see the contrast between Brock's methods, geared toward work and activity, and Rivers's, 

<b></b>

 geared toward expression of repressed experiences. Unlike Sassoon's characterization of Rivers's methods, in which the doctor asserts control over a passive patient's chaotic psyche, Brock's patients are hyper-aware of their own active attempts at control. Brock writes: "In the act of normal individual functioning . . . all the elements of time are involved. [the subject's] present action bears relation not only to his actual circumstances but is based on his past experience . . . and reaches forward into his future. The action of a neurasthenic does not show this equilibrium, this evenly–balanced flow . . . the attention of the neurasthenic may become temporarily arrested upon some element of his past or future experience, and he develops a worry or definite <i>phobia</i>" (<i>REA</i>, 28). Brock called the fear of properly functioning in linear time "ergophobia." The magazine takes on "ergophobia" as a leitmotif, spoofing one officer who cannot think of a useful hobby and begins to have nightmares about his inability to occupy himself, and scolding patients who do not submit writing to the magazine as sufferers of "hydra-phobia." </p>

<p>In homage to, and mockery of, Brock's goals of adherence to linear time, Owen's August 18, 1917 editorial recounts the misadventures of "Private Time," condemned by "Colonel Eternity" to Eternal Field Punishment for "refusing to stand still on parade."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The soldier is ordered to "Mark Time." "Marking Time" is a military command requiring that the soldier lift each foot six inches off the ground without moving forward. "Marking time" stands in for shell-shock, then, as the patients are unable to move forward in time and are forced to "march in place," re-experiencing their traumatic memories again and again. For officers like Owen, trained in classical and English verse writing, "marking time" would also be familiar as a method for scanning 

<b></b>

 classical quantitative verse (dividing it into "feet"). Like Owen working out his metrical feet in lines of verse while recovering from trauma in the hospital, the character of Private Time is compelled to "mark time" strapped to the earth on eternal march. He eventually grows weary, but a policeman, aptly named "Private Watch," is hired to make sure "Private Time" does not "stand still." Of course, the officer's body is never moving forward because it is the earth that moves beneath his feet; "marking time" is merely "putting down the feet" without making progress, as arbitrary as any order. Metrical exercises are made arbitrary, just like precise military footwork that, in this instance, <i>prevents</i> the soldier from moving forward. Both Private Time and the policeman grow weary after so much work: "It was, and is, called 'the Small Hours,' and is open from 1:30am to 4:30am." Private Watch steals into these hours and "<i>Time, in his absence, stands still, and has a rest. And hence arise many of our troubles</i>" (italics Owen's). Private Time fails to measure the hours at a precise and brisk pace, and rests only in the caesura of the "small hours," when earthly soldiers find time stretching out intolerably. Here is Owen's interpretation of the intolerability of waiting until dawn, of the dreams that double-back to memories, of the trap of constantly repeating traumas. We see the physical staggering, here, of the tired soldier forced to march transformed, in this article, into a soldier whose symptoms prevent him from walking, from moving forward in time. The arbitrariness of the military exercise is also a sly reference to the arbitrariness of writing under the auspices of rehabilitation.  </p>

<p>At Craiglockhart, officers who were unable to imagine themselves outside of the traumatic "stopped time" of neurasthenic trauma were sometimes able to piece together a functional relation to time's movement through writing poetry, though their recovery meant an inevitable return to battle. As Brock's successful Anteaus, Owen learned to manipulate the complex relationships between his feet and his head, action and expression, and returned willingly to the front where he continued to write with an increased self-awareness. Rereading Owen within the larger national contexts of the importance of English poetry and prosody, we can see how his poems try to reconcile the empty patriotic promises of prewar poetry and its "glorious" forms, critiquing the dangers of following rote militaristic feet and attempting to show how poetic form's future possibilities for meaning are merely the performance of its inability to preserve, comfort, or even endure. </p>

<p>Owen composed a fragment in his last months at Craiglockhart (dated August–September 1917) titled "I Know the Music." The eighteen line poem begins: "All sounds have been as music to my listening: / Pacific lamentation of slow bells, / The crunch of boots on blue snow rosy-glistening, / Shuffle of autumn leaves; and all farewells."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The poem continues on to name country bells clamoring and a host of other traditionally pastoral images, but the fourth stanza includes "startled clarions" and "drums, rumbling and rolling thunderous." Here, the crunch of boots is swept up in the idealized country life, and Owen leaves the last stanza unfinished, taking up these images and sounds as 

<b></b>

 part of the betrayal Owen explores in his famous war poems, "Anthem for Doomed Youth" and "Dulce et Decorum Est." In "The Calls," written in May 1918, some six months after his return to service, he begins each stanza envisioning a world measured by regular sounds, "a dismal fog-hoarse," "quick treble bells," "stern bells," "gongs hum and buzz," each occurring at a specific hour (much like his descriptions of military time in his letters). The fourth stanza dramatizes the "clumsiness" of soldiers trying to follow along in some sort of forced regularity: "A blatant bugle tears my afternoons. / Out clump the clumsy Tommies by platoons, / Trying to keep in step with rag-time tunes, / But I sit still; I've done my drill."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The manuscript copy shows that Owen deleted the lines "I've had my fill" and "Here I've no rime that's proper." Regularized external sounds, then, are allegorized in Owen's poems as a kind of suspicious discipline while, at the same time, the internal sounds of the poem, contracting and expanding in his metrical manipulation, simultaneously support and reject this allegory. It is as if this earlier poem performs a kind of homage to the sounds and forms he makes ironic in "Dulce et Decorum Est" and other more directly critical war poems, whereas "The Calls" admits that the sounds and forms of military and literary discipline are necessary, but that Owen has no "proper" way to express this unfortunate necessity. </p>

<p>There are many examples which demonstrate Owen's formal reckoning but few are as effective as his now canonized "Dulce et Decorum Est," which he began writing at Craiglockhart in October of 1917. </p>

<p class="continued">The form of Owen's famous poem is itself "bent double," like the soldiers it describes. Many critics have noted the poem's similarity to the Shakespearean sonnet form as well as its implicit reference to the lines in Wordsworth's "Leech-Gatherer": "His body was bent double, feet and head / Coming together in life's pilgrimage."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The poem is two sonnets, bent and doubled in the middle at lines thirteen and fourteen, where the lines that would normally form the final couplet in a Shakespearean sonnet simply begin a new rhyme: "light" and "drowning." Despite the formal buckling or juxtaposition with the second sonnet, the formless re of the dying man provides a perfect thematic coda to the first octave, in which the men's marching is subdued in a sort of sleep. Indeed, in the sestet, the man's re is obscured and shapeless as if underwater, his image seen through dim, thick, green light. The verbs and adjectives in the first sonnet—trudge, lame, blind, drunk, deaf—subdue the imagined activity into an embalmed slumber (these words eerily reminiscent of what one could witness in the halls of Craiglockhart). Even the flares become part of a hazy backdrop, and the menacing shells drop "softly," like petals.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Likewise, the soldier's movements are calm and imperceptibly shuffling to a failed attempt at iambic pentameter, as if the spondaic opening of "Bént dóuble" and "Knóck knéed" of the first two lines perform the extra step each man must take. When the lines settle into five stresses (lines 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8), the iambs are consistently irregular, with alliteration causing frequent trochaic and spondaic substitutions. Only the fourth line adheres to the perfect five beat iambic pentameter line: "And towárds our dístant rést begán to trúdge." The meter marches asleep here, stumbling through a rhythm that is ruled by sound patterns rather than any traditional military or literary discipline. Line 6, the longest line of the first octave, is heavy with extra stresses and halts with three pauses—"But límped ón, // blóod-shód. // Áll went láme; // áll blínd"—as if this ten-syllable line could be divided into four lines of two beats (complete with the pararhyme of "blood" and "blind"). The men's feet and the metrical feet limp on, shod in no protective form for the rhythmic beats.  </p>

<p>Lines 9 through 12 catch our breaths on the gasping repetition of "Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!" Quickly, the soldiers move, fumbling, stumbling, and fitting, as the form performs, back into the traditional ten syllables "just in time." The stumbling and fumbling of the poem is juxtaposed against the rigidity of lines 11 and 12 in exact pentameter, as if tradition somehow regularizes this chaotic moment. We hear the iambs again from the middle of line 10—"the clúmsy hélmets júst in tíme; / But sómeone stíll was yélling oút and stúmbling, / And floúnd'ring líke a mán in fíre or líme"—Owen careful to elide the "e" in floundering to keep the realigned meter regular. The man, "still" in the middle of the chaos, is caught up in the trudging slumber of the traditional iambs. Instead of a calm, sleep ridden march, the meter of this first sonnet is thrown into 

<b></b>

 suspicion. When called upon, the soldiers who could recover from their stumbling to move "just in time" were saved from the defeat of the trapped soldier, the "someone still" of the sestet. But not only is the iambic pentameter of a traditional sonnet bent and doubled in this poem, the sound structure in the first sonnet also performs a sort of bent doubling. If the meter of the first sonnet stumbles, the sound structure stammers—both the metrical and alliterative affects in the poem manifesting symptoms of trauma in their formal performances. In each line in the first octave, the sounds double on either side of a real or imaginary caesura. Some of these sounds gesture toward Owen's experiments in pararhyme, taking out the vowel center of a word and leaving the skeletal structure of the beginning and end consonants, but these stammering sounds also show how subtle repetition, like the stumble of metrical feet, coaxes the poem forward to the sound that occurs in the middle of the line while also demanding that it double back to the sound at the beginning. These effects fade in the would-be sestet: "still" morphs into the sounds of "stumbling" in line 11, and "sea" into "saw" in line 14, neither a true stammer but more a "see-saw" of imbalance to signify the defining feature of the first sonnet's movement. </p>

<p>The second sonnet's movement completes its three quatrains in reverse, beginning with the couplet of "sight" and "drowning," heralding the theme of the second part of the poem—the sight of endless drowning from which the now marching soldier cannot look away. The stumble of the broken iambic pentameter in the middle of the poem stands out against the measure of meter surrounding it. Rather than stammer through the explanation of the after-effects of the event (the stammer and stumble are, themselves, after-effects), the second sonnet foregrounds the difficulty of expressing the shocking central action—a man dying in the poisoned air—not only to an audience that has now become blind and deaf to the realities of war because of the "Old Lies" of tradition with which they themselves have been poisoned, but also through the very forum of poetic form. Lines 15 and 16 isolate the first person—recurring nightmares, the "helpless sight" of traumatic memories lurching back toward him. Daniel Hipp notes that Owen shifts the verb tenses from past in the octave through progressive verbal forms in the sestet into present tense in these lines, and, reading lines 15 and 16 as the completion of a quatrain, asserts that "the repetition of 'drowning,' at the expense of conventional rhyme emphasizes the persistence of the visual image within the poet's unconscious mind, which, like the unfinished 'sonnet,' has remained unresolved."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Rather, these two lines signal the mirror image of the second sonnet, pitting "I saw him drowning" against "before my helpless sight" as twin feelings, meant to emphasize both the transition of a past memory into a present nightmare but also to show a dissatisfaction with forms that save only some.  </p>

<p>Meter and movement transform here, after the chaos of gas, from an automatic march back from the front into a different kind of awareness for the soldiers; the soldiers are marching with the same feet, but their paces occur with a forced and artificial regularity, symptomatic of the uneven, uncontrolled re who disrupts the regularity in the middle of the poem, and whose re now threatens to disrupt it again. The return to a fervent iambic pentameter in line 17 answers and, in some ways, remedies 

<b></b>

 the chaos jolting before the soldiers in the wagon. Lines 17 through 28 are one long, rambling, accusatory sentence with relatively straightforward syntax. As readers, we are jolted by frequent spondaic substitutions in this second sonnet: "you too," "white eyes writhe," "high zest," "old Lie." The only perfectly iambic line, line twenty-one—"If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood"—calls our attention to these jolts, this blood, and our own ear's ability to hear them in the second sonnet. "Dulce et Decorum Est" does not perform an upright, decorous form and it shows, in its breaking of the Latin meter in the final line, how neither English nor classical meter can withstand the threats of modern forms of war. The Latin tag from Horace, "'Tis sweet and mete to die for one's country" allows us to rethink the word "mete"; both "just punishment" to die for one's country that we are urged "not to tell," and the measure of this sacrifice, which, through meter, is "told" in the poem's stumbling prosodic performance. The poem's formal status, bent-double and attempting to recover from the trauma at its center, gives the reader an awareness of forms as both possible and impossible emblems of recovery and survival. But finally, the poem's own verbs are evidence for the war poet's true task: cough, curse, turn, trudge, limp on, fit, choke, smother, pace, gargle, <i>not</i> tell—though the poem's form recovers from its own chaotic center to show the <i>necessity</i> of telling, and the bittersweet triumph of steady, controlled pacing as the only possible method for that telling. The second sonnet's accusation is also its central opposition: "If you too could pace . . . you would not tell." We can read the lurking hysteria in the middle of the poem both literally and allegorically—an anxiety about the way that pacing and time significantly prevent the poem from "telling" its own formal absurdities, and an anxiety from the re of the writer as choking soldier, witnessing his own inability to tell, pace, measure, or order experience. </p>

<p>Owen died before he could fashion his own poetic monument, and his critical legacy has been shaped and reshaped by critics who see his progression as either Georgian (a romantic pastoral legacy) or chronologically modern. Within the context of Craiglockhart, we can read Owen's later poems as partial products of therapy that re-educated its patients to recognize and confront their hysteria, reordering its reception in the mind through a reconnection to the physical and social world. Meter's place in that particular microcosm was at times allegorical, at times literal, but almost always empowering. This counterpoint, in which deliberate and measured language is at once an exercise in recovery from modernity's chaos as well as a constant reminder of the tyrannies of historical order that led to formal rupture in the first place, serves as an important double-movement for famous war writers such as Owen as well as for the thousands of soldier poets whose names did not find their way into the canon. Even today we are haunted by the coupling of military discipline and disciplined literary language as an exercise that is at once potentially therapeutic and potentially detrimental. Almost three years ago, the National Endowment for the Arts announced <i>Operation Homecoming</i>, a program funded by Boeing Corporation and backed by "a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Defense." The program encourages soldiers returning from tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq to submit poems, letters, and stories for publication. The resulting anthology, <i>Operation Homecoming: Iraq, Afghanistan, </i>

<b></b>

<i> and the Home Front in the Words of U.S. Troops and their Families</i>, was published by Random House in September 2006. This anthology will be distributed in schools throughout the country. Defending the project in <i>Poetry </i>magazine (in which poet Eleanor Wilner sparked debate), Jon Parris Peede pleaded on behalf of the educative and democratic intent of the project, asserting that "not everyone is given the time or the opportunity—or the encouragement—to use writing as a means of expression or reflection" and that this archive of writing creates "essential dialogue" that can be "at once therapeutic, cathartic, and calming" for reader, writer, and society in general. Indeed, we have grown accustomed to associating literary expression with therapeutic catharsis just as we are haunted by the possibility of militaristic meters lurking in form. Vietnam veteran and Pulitzer Prize winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa protests that "writing poetry has hardly anything to do with therapy . . . . Poetry cannot serve as an emotional bandage for the blood and guts of warfare" while Major Robert Sayre writes that "[T]he need to understand and order what they have returned with will drive some of [the soldiers] to poetry."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  A different understanding of "literariness" and "craft" is necessary to interpret the relationship between poetry and therapy in the First World War and may, in turn, help us to understand our contemporary expectations and anxieties about poetry's place in wartime.  </p>

<p id="lead">"On the German Republic" is the title of a lecture that Thomas Mann delivered in Berlin on 13 October, 1922. It was a moment of high political tensions, as his daughter Erika later recalled when writing her memoirs in 1956: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Waves of insurrection and terror were sweeping the country. Democratic politicians had been shamefully assassinated, including the best among them, Walter Rathenau, whom Thomas Mann knew well. The German middle classes, unwilling to acknowledge the lost war's consequences as such, held the young Republic responsible for all the hardships. Thomas Mann's great essay, "On the German Republic" , was his political recognition of the Republic in its hour of need and his most inopportune "step" since the <i>Reflections</i>. At this critical juncture its effect was startling, as if the author had thrown an incendiary bomb into his own house.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Erika, all too plainly, was rehearsing a quasi-mythical account that circulated within the family circle, albeit one often affirmed by later critics. Theo Stammen has called the lecture/essay "a crucial text in the corpus of Thomas Mann's political writings," while Terrence Reed has urged that it signaled "a startling change" in his political outlook: "If his wartime stand had come as a shock to those who thought him a liberal intellectual, his new position was an equal shock to those who had come to rely on him as a conservative nationalist."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Conservative readers, Hinrich Siefkin reiterates, "felt betrayed when the attitude he had taken and expressed seemed to change . . . in 'On the German Republic.'"<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But it was not just his political outlook that had changed; the arguments 

<b></b>

 that Mann adopted to support this reversal were also striking, unusual, perhaps even startling. Within the essay Mann, according to Michael Maar, was justifying "this reversal, among other ways, by the fact that Walt Whitman in his phallically brimming fervour was the singer of democracy, and that democracy and male love stem from the same roots."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Or to put it slightly differently, the essay was as close as Mann ever came to acknowledging in public his own divided homoerotic impulses, acknowledgement that tied his recognition of the Weimar Republic to an ecstatic reading of Walt Whitman. The result was a work that is dazzling, complex, and perennially surprising, yet one whose importance has largely escaped Anglophone readers chiefly because it was Mann himself who insisted, in 1942 when the essay was translated into English, that its most explicit and extended passage concerning male love be suppressed.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  As he explained to his patron and devoted friend Agnes Meyer: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Thank you for reminding me about the decidedly desirable omission of those pages from "On the German Republic." I had almost forgotten my resolution. It's clear that an American readership, for very praiseworthy reasons, wouldn't know what to make of it. It's not scandal one has to worry about, but confusion. It is self-evident that the pages will have to go.</p>
<p>Homoeroticism is a human phenomenon as old as the hills and in antiquity it actually played a role in shaping culture and the state. To want it to have such a role today (as was attempted in Germany, in a literary way: Hans Blüher) would be bad romanticism. In my essay on Platen I said that I consider it unproductive and aesthetically death-bound, and that also comes through in <i>The Magic Mountain</i>. From an artistic standpoint, this subject can only be treated in a style that is grotesque, as Proust did.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Mann's decision, however debatable, was duly executed by his translator, Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter, with the result that Mann's great essay has been available to English-speaking readers only in a truncated, or even mutilated, form. Worse still, although the "omission of those pages" has recently been rectified through an excellent translation of them by David Fernbach, even that restoration still leaves a sadly incomplete and unsatisfactory version in English.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  For as English-language scholars of Mann have ruefully come to recognize in recent years: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . essentially two Thomas Manns continue to circulate in the English-speaking world: the German originals read by academics and some students of German, and the Lowe-Porter "adaptations into English" . . . which, unbeknown to the English-speaking world, constitute a different, a pseudo-Mann. It is a deplorable situation, for which no remedy is in sight.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">That formulation, articulated by Timothy Buck, may sound extreme, but it will seem only reasonable to someone who has compared the Lowe-Porter translation of "On the German Republic" with Mann's original German. For reasons that cannot now be reconstructed, Lowe-Porter chose to drop batches of sentences that in total comprise nearly two hundred words of Mann's original text. More capriciously, quotations by Goethe and Walt Whitman are unilaterally altered.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In short, what has rightly been 

<b></b>

 understood as a critical turning-point in Mann's development has been accessible to English-speaking readers only in a version that does not meet ordinary standards of accuracy and reliability, obscuring the import of a document that reverberates with implications for those perennial debates about modernism and politics, or the relationship between the aesthetic and the social, the private and public spheres. </p>

<p>Mann delivered his lecture at a site that was almost as improbable as some of his lengthiest sentences: the Beethoven Auditorium (Beethovensaal) of the Philharmonic complex, with its entrance on Köthenerstraße, 32, in central Berlin (see front cover). Opened in 1899, it had been intended as a venue for chamber concerts and other smaller events sponsored by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, a function it was still fulfilling in 1922. It had been designed by Ludwig Heim (1844–?), a highly successful architect responsible for several distinguished hotels and banks in Berlin, of which the most notable survivor is the Dresdener Bank building (1887–1889) on Behrenstraße, 36–39 (the east-west street is found just south of Unter den Linden and was the heart of the city's banking district). Its exterior was a readily recognizable version of late Italian Renaissance, while the interior marshaled classical motifs within a more eclectic and Wilhelmine mixture that included Gothic arches. The room had a maximum seating capacity of 1,066, and its lofty ceiling (12.8m, or nearly 42 feet high) culminated in a central fresco panel, painted by the otherwise unknown Vital Schmitt and depicting the Apotheosis of Beethoven: angels and other onlookers (are they perhaps muses?) watch, with expressions of admiration and surprise, as the composer spirals up and away into the empyrean.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  (The fresco has long since disappeared, along with the entire building complex, destroyed by Allied bombing, which fell from midnight to 6:00 a.m on 29 January, 1944 [see back cover]).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  </p>

<p>We know very little about the event that was Mann's lecture. No notices or advertisements for it have been found in contemporary newspapers, leaving it unclear whether it took place in the afternoon or evening, or whether there was an admission fee. Subsequent press reports uniformly avoid remarking on either the size or composition of the audience, though Mann himself repeatedly makes direct addresses to "German youth" and "students," and sometimes further reference to "citizens." That raises an additional conundrum, for we cannot be certain how many of the students were also veterans, especially those former officers of lower ranks who often participated in the right-wing paramilitary groups that so threatened the Republic. Homoerotic bonds were a significant component of some groups, not least in parts of the SA (Sturmabteilung), the paramilitary wing of the Nazi party, formed in late summer of 1921 shortly after the party had accepted Hitler as its leader, together with the "leadership principle" (Führerprinzip), and effectively headed by Ernst Röhm, a homosexual. But the Nazi party, at that point, contained scarcely 2,000 members, and although these were concentrated in Munich, where Mann himself resided, and although he had expressed distaste for the party already in 1921, it is very unlikely that he knew much about its detailed workings.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  It is more likely, in other words, that his remarks responded to more diffuse (and, by their nature, undocumented) rumors about various <i>Freikorps</i> and monarchist associations. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The question of the intended audience and its constitution is important for its bearing on another issue: the nature, genre, or kind of the work. Are we to read the text of "On the German Republic" as the transcription of a talk or lecture? Or should we instead view it as something more formal, a polished and intricate essay that just happened to be read aloud before it achieved its proper embodiment in print? Are we to assess it as hortatory rhetoric, intent on argument and persuasion? Or was it something more literary or even fictional in nature, something intent on play and speculation, and scarcely concerned with the pragmatic outcomes typically at stake in acts of persuasion? We make—and indeed <i>must</i> make—such distinctions in everyday life. But "On the German Republic" both invokes and dissolves them. One strand of the text insists on its rhetorical, persuasive ambitions: "Let me say it openly: to the extent it's needed, my aim is to win you over to the side of the republic, of what is termed democracy, and what I term humanity" (113.42–114.1). Or again: "In my attempt to convince you . . . " (bei meinem Überredungsversuch) (130.36). Another is openly, even self-consciously fictive. It directly addresses the German dramatist Gerhart Hauptmann, even placing him in the front row of the auditorium—though he was not present at the lecture at all, except in Mann's imagination. It repeatedly pauses to comment on the reactions of the audience, even offering retorts to those reactions; but the audience's reactions were and are entirely fictional creations by Mann. It was precisely this uneasy conflation or confusion of genres and modes that more than one critic found disconcerting: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I had been invited to a lecture [Vortrag], which is an oral, personal, and direct utterance that flows from one person to another, who is affected by it. Thomas Mann, instead, read an essay [Aufsatz] that has already been set up in print, if not yet published. In comparison with what one expected, the experience—however good the essay may well be—was a dry and mediated affair of galley-proofs rather than of something flowing to its auditors. Still worse, as was the case here, when the essay infelicitously plays with the form of a lecture, refers to fictive circumstances and answers imaginary audience reactions that were never to be seen or heard among the audience actually in attendance. "My angry friends!" When nobody has expressed anger. "I hear booing." When not even a cat has stirred. "There is a hush in the auditorium, for which I am partly responsible." When nothing in the auditorium has changed.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Yet another commented on the bewilderment of "anyone who tried to follow this lecture without being confused, or rather something that was more essay than lecture, one that will soon be in print."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  </p>

<p>"On the German Republic" breaks with the proprieties that normally distinguish the lecture and essay, invoking and yet dissolving both within an antic swirl of quotations, citations that often diverge into extensive digressions that are then threaded back into yet another swirl of quotations. In total there are more than seventy-five of them from Gerhart Hauptmann, Stefan George, Goethe, Nietzsche, Flaubert, Wagner, Novalis, Whitman, the Austrian writer Adalbert Stifter, the Russian critic Merezhkovsky, the German poet August von Platen, and even the Holy Roman Emperor Lothar I (795–855). Characters from plays by Shakespeare and Schiller jostle alongside ancient heroes like Harmodios and Aristogiton, all surrounded by contemporary popular expressions and 

<b></b>

 proverbs. A genuine playfulness surges through the entire text, surfacing, for example, in the speaker's unconcealed pleasure over the effect that he imagines his words having on his audience: "Republic—how do you like that word coming, as it does, from my lips? Not very much, to judge by certain sounds . . . " (113.9–10). This discernible pleasure in the play of ideas and language is real, unmistakable, almost palpable, and it infuses the essay with an element that borders on the voluptuous—which, after all, is one of the essay's central and recurrent themes: the sensual pleasures of the body, pleasures that range from homoerotic ones to others such as song or even the joys of speech and conversation. Language, or at least speech, is produced by the body, after all, and it is a literal body politic that now becomes the foundation for a notion of democracy differing from one grounded solely in rationalist or Enlightenment principles, one now wholly compatible with the romantic tradition deemed crucial to German national identity. As a consequence, Mann can also reconcile the divide between culture and the state, between aesthetic creation and politics, that had been such a prominent legacy of nineteenth-century German thought precisely because until 1871 there had been no German state in which they could be reconciled, while after 1871 the state's authoritarian cast had still led thinkers such as Nietzsche and others to reassert that strict divide between art and politics, the aesthetic and the social.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Through quotation, Mann now restages the creation of an imaginary community of writers actively, and as it were bodily, engaged with the public sphere. </p>

<p>Neither lecture or essay, or rather an uneasy mixture of both, Mann's work may also owe something to another genre in which elements of performance were intermixed with stylized announcement of a position about some matter of urgency. Certainly Mann himself invoked a third genre when he wrote a letter to his friend Ernst Bertram on 8 July, 1922, just when he was beginning to write "On the German Republic." "I am in pain over the distorted state of Germany's features. I am thinking about shaping a birthday article on Hauptmann into a sort of manifesto, in which I will appeal to the conscience of young people, or those young people who listen to me. I am not renouncing the <i>Reflections</i> and I'm the last person to ask young people to be enthusiastic about things that are beyond them, such as socialism and democracy. But the mechanical adoption of reactionary positions I have already dismissed as sentimental crudity, and a new humanity can thrive on the soil of democracy no less than on the soil of the old Germany."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Mann completed "On the German Republic" by the end of August and sent off the manuscript on 1 September. On 6 October he read it aloud to a small circle of friends, a group that also included his brother Heinrich. That inclusion was telling: it was only since the beginning of 1922 that the two brothers had begun to speak to one another again, drawing an end to nearly eight years of silence that had begun with the breakout of the First World War in 1914. Heinrich had strongly opposed the war, and it was in great measure as a result of his quarrel with Heinrich that Thomas Mann had gone on to write the <i>Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man</i>, his long apologia for the war that finally appeared in 1918. When, two weeks after the private reading, Mann read his lecture/essay/manifesto aloud to the audience gathered at the Beethovensaal in Berlin, 

<b></b>

 Heinrich was again in the audience. Indeed, he is the only member of the audience whose identity is firmly established. </p>

<p>Perhaps it does not really matter which genre we assign to "On the German Republic." It offers pleasures, both in content and form, that are genuine enough, and its complex affirmation of the Weimar Republic was indeed a brave and prescient step. Its guarded affirmation of male love also bespoke a level of tolerance that was unusual for its time and still valuable today. Whatever genre we ascribe to "On the German Republic," it remains a compelling political and literary testimony from one of the golden moments of modernism, a moment also fraught with tension and anxiety. After all, ten months before Mann delivered his lecture, <i>Ulysses</i> had just been published, while "The Waste Land" would make its first appearance in periodical form only three days later. Two weeks after that, the March on Rome would bring Benito Mussolini to power, giving apparent legitimacy to a political movement unknown before the outbreak of the First World War. For Mann, the moment was indeed a turning point, and he never looked back. When he next appeared at the Beethovensaal in Berlin in 1930, it was to deliver his famous "Appeal to Reason," an impassioned warning to voters of the dangers contained in the growing forces of the far right. Three years later, Mann would feel the force of that warning on his own pulses: he was in exile in Switzerland, never to return to live in Germany. </p>

<p>The translations that follow present three works by Mann, "On the German Republic" and two others closely related to it. The first of the others is "Hans Reisiger's Edition of Walt Whitman: A Letter" ("Hans Reisigers Whitman-Werk: ein Brief"), an open letter in which Mann celebrates the ethical and literary power of Walt Whitman, as experienced in a two-volume translation into German by Hans Reisiger. The letter appeared in April, 1922, some six months before Mann gave his public reading of "On the German Republic." The other is "Foreword [to 'On the German Republic']," a polemical defense that was published on Christmas eve of 1922, or some seven weeks after "On the German Republic" first appeared in print. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT9" href="#REF9">9</a>. The following is a brief catalogue of unwarranted omissions and alterations by Lowe-Porter in her translation of "On the German Republic" (see note 5):  on page six, up four lines from the bottom, between the words "within himself!" and "He stood . . . " there are two sentences (twenty-five words) in the original that are simply dropped;  on page nine, ten lines up from the bottom, immediately following the word "comradeship," there are three sentences (ninety-three words) and then a quotation of seven lines (another fifty words) from a poem that are omitted.  On page twenty-five, down eleven lines from the top, the paragraph ending with "whoever does is a republican": in the original German the paragraph continues for another fourteen words, all omitted.  On page forty-one, down three lines from the top, the words from "If the manager" to "are safe" make up a sentence within a quotation from Goethe, one that Mann deliberately omitted when he quoted the entire passage, signalling his omission with an ellipsis. Lowe-Porter restores the omitted sentence.  On the same page, up ten lines from the bottom, following the word "researches," Lowe-Porter omits another six words which all list the fields of study that Wilhelm Meister explores.  Again on the same page, the passage assigned to Walt Whitman that runs from eight to five lines up from the bottom, is one found nowhere in his oeuvre; it represents Lowe-Porter's adaptation of another passage that is indeed by Whitman, an adaptation presumably invented to meet the syntactic exigencies of her translation. One could also quarrel with Lowe-Porter's rendering at a very basic level of accuracy. Mann, at one point, quite correctly quotes a passage from Novalis that condemns <i>Philister</i>, or Philistines. But Lowe-Porter, one page ten, fifteen lines down from the top, turns the Philistines into "philosophers"! </p>

1. Projects of Language Reform
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p id="lead">

The concern of this article is language, and specifically the various projects of linguistic "purification" that were part of literary modernism in Britain. It will explore a range of texts and projects concerned with reforming spoken and written forms of English and will argue that modernist cultural practice can be understood in relation to an aspiration towards linguistic reform, not simply in the sense of aesthetic innovation and experiment, but also in the context of educational, cultural, and political initiatives designed to transform linguistic usage and norms. </p>

<p>Projects of language reform are not, of course, distinctively modernist, though they do have some claim to be distinctively modern. If the development of the printing press from the late fifteenth century is one of the foundations of modernity, it is in its immediate wake that we find the first concerted efforts at language reform, with the period between 1560 and 1630 seeing "an unparalleled amount of activity in the field of spelling reform in English."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  With the decline of Latin as an international language in the seventeenth century, there was then a growing anxiety about the suitability of the English language as a medium for general philosophical and scientific inquiry. Thus, the Royal Society set up a committee for improving the English language 

<b></b>

 in 1664, which was to include among its members Robert Hooke, Sir Isaac Newton and John Dryden. And in the eighteenth century both the acerbic wit of Jonathan Swift and the obsessive scholarship of Samuel Johnson were trained on the target of precise and correct usage of the English language: Johnson's 1755 <i>Dictionary</i> aimed to provide precise definitions of words "in the context of an academic attention to the possibilities of a perfect English language."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Such desires for precision and correctness coupled with fears of linguistic dilution are thus not recent phenomena, but can be found within cultural criticism from the early-modern period.  </p>

<p>The urgency and the perceived importance of linguistic reform in Britain increased markedly, however, as English became a more prominent international language for intellectual argument and for scientific inquiry, and then again as the literate public expanded over the course of the nineteenth century. The extension of compulsory elementary education across the nineteenth century to the point of universal provision brought the challenges of new readers and new modes of writing, but it also created an institutional location, the elementary school, in which projects of reform could be imagined and even realized. By the early years of the twentieth century, the capacity of the English language to enable precise and widespread communication, to articulate forms of national identity, and to sustain intellectual and artistic innovations were all the subject of intense debate. And these political, cultural, and pedagogical questions interact intriguingly with the avant-garde and radical political and artistic projects from this period that we have come to understand under the heading of "modernism." </p>

<p>Concern for and with the English language was expressed by the formation of a wide range of societies and associations in the early twentieth century, which aimed to publicize their anxieties and to advocate possible remedies for the perceived defects of the English language. One of these organizations was the Society for Pure English, whose early membership consisted of prominent writers and literary critics, including Thomas Hardy, Edith Wharton, Robert Bridges, A. C. Bradley, and Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. To quote from their 1913 founding <i>Prospectus</i>: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is therefore proposed that a few men of letters, supported by the scientific alliance of the best linguistic authorities, should form a group or free association, and agree upon a modest and practical scheme for informing popular taste on sound principles, for guiding educational authorities, and for introducing into practice certain slight modifications and advantageous changes.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">"Men of letters" are here understood to have a particular responsibility for the state of English and also to have a specific duty to inform, and to reform, popular taste. The Society for Pure English sought to harness the reforming energies of the "best linguistic authorities," but it was nonetheless committed to a project that was both democratic and popular: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Believing that language is or should be democratic both in character and in origin, and that its best word-makers are the uneducated, and not the educated classes, we would prefer vivid popular terms to the artificial creations of scientists. (…) we shall help to preserve the living and popular character of our speech.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
<b></b>
</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">From these strongly populist beginnings, the Society for Pure English produced a regular series of tracts between the end of the First World War and the 1930s. The membership grew, and the Society continued to attract a range of writers, artists, academics, and "linguistic authorities." By 1919, for example, Roger Fry, Jane Harrison, and Gilbert Murray were all members. The Society's early association of "the people" with linguistic authenticity, expressed so forcefully in their 1913 <i>Prospectus</i> was, however, subjected to increasing pressure, and by 1925, Robert Bridges, who was then Poet Laureate, was arguing that, "the fact that language develops in the common talk of the people is as true as ever, but it is a truth that is nowadays much qualified by the fact that everyone now reads."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Mass literacy here apparently represents some rupture in the association of "the people" with linguistic authenticity, and for Bridges at least popular speech was now no guarantee of the vitality of written English. </p>

<p>Language reform in the early years of the century was driven not only by such anxieties about linguistic impurity, but also by a desire for more effective global communication. Many writers and reformers argued that the variety of languages across the globe represented a barrier to the full achievement of effective international communication that was otherwise implicit in new electronic and print technologies. The aspiration towards an "international language" was manifested in a wide variety of schemes for linguistic reform from the 1890s. Perhaps the most famous of these is Esperanto, an artificial language devised by Lodovic L. Zamenhof at the end of the nineteenth century. Zamenhof grew up in what was then Russian territory, though his hometown of Bialystok is now part of Poland. He witnessed a complex series of violent conflicts between the different ethnic and linguistic groups living in this region, which convinced him of the urgency of developing a new linguistic medium for more effective communication. Zamenhof himself spoke Polish, German, Russian, Lithuanian, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, and English but was nonetheless worried about the time and energy necessarily expended in the mastery of so many languages. As the poet Ciaran Carson notes in a recent article describing his father's close involvement with Esperanto from the 1930s, "from an early age Zamenhof was anguished that men and women everywhere looked much the same, yet spoke differently, and thought themselves to be Poles, or Russians, Germans, Jews, and so on, instead of human beings."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Zamenhof argued that through the establishment of a new international language, "the whole world would be as one family."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  His choice of the pseudonym "Dr Esperanto" stressed the real hope such a world language could bring for those who sought to move beyond the proliferation of national cultures and towards an international alliance of peoples.  </p>

<p>Zamenhof based his language largely on existing Romance languages. He devised a system of root words, with suffixes and prefixes being used to designate modifications. Word endings were used to indicate parts of speech, and by this means Zamenhof significantly reduced the importance of word order within his language. A flavor of the language can be gained from the following translation of the popular nursery rhyme, "Baa Baa Black Sheep": 



 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>"Baa Baa black sheep! Have you any wool?" <br />"Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full! <br />
One for the master, and one for the dame,  <br />
And one for the little boy who lives down the lane." </p>
<p>"Ba, ba safo! Cu hi havas lanon?" <br />
"Jes, tri sakojin: prenu en la manon! <br />
Unu por la mastro, unu por mastrin, <br />
Kaj unu por la eta knabo ce la strata fin."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p>By the time of Zamenhof's death in 1917, Esperanto had attracted significant numbers of supporters and speakers, who worked together in clubs, evening classes, and congresses to advocate the widespread adoption of the language as an aid to mutual understanding. The irony of the death of this proponent of world peace through a common language during an unprecedented period of military conflict is of course considerable. The very destructiveness of the First World War, however, was to generate an urgent desire to avoid a repetition of violence on such a scale that would dominate subsequent discussions of the possibility of an international language. </p>

<p>In the 1920s, Sylvia Pankhurst was also preoccupied by the search for an international language. Sylvia Pankhurst is now best known for her work in the early years of the twentieth century within the suffrage movement, a movement that was an important context for the development of aspects of a modernist cultural project.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  She also played a significant role in a range of socialist movements from around 1912, including the Workers' Socialist Federation, which affiliated to the newly formed Third Communist International, and was thus part of the process of formation of the British Communist Party in 1920. By the 1920s, however, language reform, and in particular the creation of an international language of communication, occupied perhaps a surprising amount of Pankhurst's time and energies. She wrote in 1927 that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Interlanguage will play its part in the making of the future, in which the peoples of the world shall be one people: a people cultivated and kind, and civilized beyond today's conception, speaking a common language.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">We first find evidence of Pankhurst's enthusiasm for the idea of an international language in the journal <i>Germinal</i>, which she cofounded in 1923: the first issue of the journal includes a substantial item on Esperanto, which describes the history and nature of the language, arguing that "by learning Esperanto you acquire Citizenship of the World," and advertising a forthcoming introduction to Esperanto published by Pankhurst's own Dreadnought Press.  </p>

<p>By 1927, Pankhurst's commitment to an international language was more vigorous, though her belief in the viability of Esperanto had considerably slackened. In a study of the future of international language published in that year, Pankhurst acknowledged the achievements of Esperanto, but argued for the superior virtues of an alternative system known as Interlingua, which was developed by Giuseppe Peano in 1904. Pankhurst 

<b></b>

 was keen to stress the progressive and liberatory potential of a commitment to international language, arguing that "the greater share of the first spade-work for Interlanguage was done by Socialists and lovers of popular fraternity."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Pankhurst's advocacy of Interlingua finds further expression in her 1928 volume, <i>Is An International Language Possible?</i>, published on behalf of the British section of the Academia Pro Interlingua. In this text, she insists that a new international language could command widespread acceptance if it were fully supported by schools and by the media, and cites as enthusiastic proponents authorities from Descartes, Pascal, and Leibniz to the more contemporary Nietzsche, who "declared the coming of universal language to be a certain as that of aviation." Pankhurst here describes Interlingua in positive terms as "Latin without inflexions."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The return to linguistic classicism here does, of course, have its modernist literary resonances. But for many commentators such a return to Latin could not possibly address the linguistic challenges of international communication in the early twentieth century. Among the more significant of the various alternative attempts to imagine a linguistic medium for effective international communication is the substantial cultural and linguistic project of "Basic English" as it developed from the early 1920s under the auspices of C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. The idea of BASIC (as well as having the more obvious meanings of plain and simple, it stands for British American Scientific International Commercial) is closely connected to the broader philosophical investigations into the nature of meaning conducted by Ogden and Richards in the early 1920s. In a text such as <i>The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language Upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism,</i> Ogden and Richards lay out a view of the nature of language and in particular of the domains of the symbolic and the emotive in language, which was to provide the intellectual framework for much critical engagement with the developing practice of modernist poetics. Ogden and Richards's work on "the peculiarly difficult borderlands of linguistics and psychology" in <i>The Meaning of Meaning</i> drew on interdisciplinary models derived from philosophy, literary criticism, and ethnography to develop a generalized model of a science of meaning, and to understand "how words work."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  That the legacy of this research should encompass both the development of models of critical close-reading that were to make the canonization of modernist literary writing possible in the 1950s, and also the development of a new simplified pedagogy for the teaching of English as an additional language, is both fascinating and perplexing.  </p>

<p>Looking back on the creation and development of Basic English from the vantage point of the 1940s, Richards indicated its close intellectual relation to the period of <i>The Meaning of Meaning</i>, or of the companion text <i>The Foundation of Aesthetics</i> published in that great year of modernist innovation, 1922: "It [Basic] had its origin, perhaps in 1920 when Ogden and I were considering the analysis and control of the meanings of the word 'meaning'."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Ogden and Richards's aim was to create a simplified version of English, which could nonetheless form the basis of precise and effective communication: 



 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Basic English is English made simple by limiting the number of its words to 850, and by cutting down the rules for using them to the smallest number necessary for the clear statement of ideas.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup></p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>B</i>, 20)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">For Richards, developing and publicizing Basic was part of a broader commitment to a politics of community and of collectivism: "the learning and use of the common language should be symbolic of the learner's participation in the common human political effort, a sign that he recognises the claim upon him of the world community" (<i>B</i>, 10). For Ogden, it was also perceived as a means to avoid further wars: "the absence of a common medium of communication is the chief obstacle to international understanding, and therefore the chief underlying cause of War."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Ogden and Richards were thus committed to the development of a common international language as a means to create a people that would not be bound by frontiers, a global citizenry able to draw on the resources of new communications technologies such as radio, telephone, and cinema to construct a distinctly modern version on community.  </p>

<p>Ogden and Richards's initiative had a significant impact on the literary and political culture of the early 1930s, and the significance and viability of Basic English were widely debated. Ogden interestingly noted the potential shared terrain of Basic English and the contemporary literary innovations of James Joyce in his 1931 study, <i>Debabelization</i>. But he was also quick to point out the distinction between Basic and what he saw as the fruitless project of creating an international language on the basis of widespread borrowings from a range of existing languages, suggesting, however, that "a foretaste of such a language may be found in the later work of James Joyce."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  I will return to this apparent dichotomy between the project of Basic English and Joycean linguistic experimentation a little later.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
2. T. S. Eliot and the Nature of Poetic Language
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The epigraph to this paper contains what is for me a highly resonant phrase from T. S. Eliot's <i>Four Quartets</i>: "to purify the dialect of the tribe." This phrase, borrowed not quite faithfully from Mallarmé and containing a homage to Edgar Allan Poe, haunts me as I try to think through the complex relations between modernism and linguistic reform. It embodies the symbolist presence within modernism while also staging an argument about the relations between poetic writing and the people. The power of Eliot's phrase lies in its capacity to evoke histories and texts that stage a poetic argument about the social function and the poetic function of language.  </p>

<p><i>Four Quartets</i> engages consistently with the question of language. In three out of the four sections there are passages that explicitly evoke the struggle of a poet with the raw material of poetry. Thus in the fifth part of 'Burnt Norton' Eliot writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words strain, <br />
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden, <br />
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish, 

<b></b>

 <br />
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place, <br />
Will not stay still.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>FQ</i>, 12)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">This follows on from a reflection on the role of form and pattern in creating meanings. Words are expressive, Eliot suggests, because (like music) they exist in time and form a pattern. The pattern, however, is one of "silence" and the movement one of stillness. The conflict generated by such a movement towards stasis or by articulated words reaching towards silence is picked up in the passage above, which insists on "tension," "strain," and "decay" as integral qualities of the linguistic medium. The decay is generated by imprecision, but also by the movement that is a fundamental aspect of language as an expressive form. Again in "East Coker," Eliot returns to examine "the intolerable wrestle with words and with meanings" (<i>FQ</i>, 17) and he asks whether we can expect any significant help in this struggle from the poetic tradition that lies behind and within us. Later, in the fifth part of "East Coker," he returns to the question of linguistic inadequacy in the following terms: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years – <br />
Twenty years largely wasted, the years of <i>l'entre deux guerres</i> – <br />
Trying to learn to use words, and every attempt <br />
Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure <br />
Because one has only learnt to get the better of words <br />
For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which  <br />
One is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture <br />
Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate  <br />
With shabby equipment always deteriorating <br />
In the general mess of imprecision of feeling, <br />
Undisciplined squads of emotion.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>FQ</i>, 21–22)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p>By the final section of the poem ("Little Gidding") then, Eliot has already set in play a series of ideas about poetic language that have at their core the dilemma of imprecision and the legacy of poetic tradition. In the second part of this final section, Eliot stages an encounter between the persona of the poem and a mysterious ghostly stranger who offers the poet advice. The ghost talks to the poet about his relation to the past, discloses some of the "gifts reserved for age" and exhorts the poet to remember that final judgement will not be based on worldly successes or secular values. The meeting takes place "In the uncertain hours before the morning" and the encounter is obscure in many senses. The ghostly stranger is uncannily familiar and reminds the poet of "some dead master / Whom I had known, forgotten, half-recalled" (<i>FQ</i>, 38). In her study of the composition of <i>Four Quartets</i>, Helen Gardener has argued that "in the first and second version, the ghost speaks with Eliot's own voice. It is, in a profound sense, a meeting with himself."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In later revisions, the stranger comes increasingly to resemble W. B. Yeats. Eliot was aware of Yeats's interest in the relations between poetic language and the language of popular speech as well as his commitment to transformative reworking of this speech. Eliot himself acknowledged the importance of Yeats for the creation of the ghostly stranger, writing "the visionary re has now become 

<b></b>

 somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  But the episode is also reminiscent of a meeting that takes place in Dante's <i>Inferno</i> XV, where Dante gives a cry of horrified recognition on meeting his old master Brunetto Latini. Given that Eliot had drawn on a verse form in this section of the poem (terza rima) that is so powerfully associated with Dante, his poetic legacy is also very clearly part of the argument being staged.  </p>

<p>The "familiar compound ghost" thus contains elements of Eliot himself, of Dante, and of Yeats. The phrase with which I am most directly concerned in this discussion, however, adds to this mixture the voice of the symbolist Mallarmé. Mallarmé uses the image of purification in a sonnet called "The Tomb of Edgar Poe," which was published in 1877. In the first four lines of the sonnet Mallarmé imagines a reawakened Poe confronting his uncomprehending contemporaries with drawn sword. Then Mallarmé writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Eux, comme un vil sursaut d'hydre oyant jadis l'ange <br />
Donner un sens plus pur aux mots de la tribu <br />
Proclamèrent très haut le sortilège bu <br />
Dans le flot sans honneur de quelque noir mélange. </p>
<p>They, like a writhing hydra, hearing seraphim <br />
Bestow a purer sense on the language of the horde, <br />
Loudly proclaimed that the magic potion had been poured <br />
From the dregs of some dishonoured mixture of foul slime.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The purification Mallarmé evokes here expresses a fundamental separation. The poet, Poe, is despised and misunderstood and the value of his poetic currency is not recognized. Purification is his work, but the sonnet cannot imagine this as in any sense a social or collective act. If Mallarmé is fascinated by the kind of poetic purification that Poe seems to enable, then Eliot is markedly more uneasy. Eliot writes disapprovingly that "an irresponsibility towards the meaning of words is not infrequent with Poe," and connects this explicitly to the symbolist desire for "la poésie pure."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> </p>

<p>So what does this allusion to Mallarmé, added, Helen Gardner suggests, at a late stage in the poem's composition, do to Eliot's already complexly layered argument about speech and poetic language?<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  It draws our attention firstly to the fact and then to the importance of the English language as the medium of composition of Eliot's poem. Mallarmé himself was in fact interested in the creative and poetic potential of the English language. In his short study, <i>Les mots anglais </i>, Mallarmé wrote about the ways in which the English language carried traces of other languages and histories, and Françoise Meltzer has suggested that he saw its poetic potential as quite distinct from that of French: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>French, on the other hand, underwent a kind of forced cleansing, with the sixteenth-century Pléiade. The Pléiade's insistence on a standardized orthography and on the use only of words with Latinate etymologies was a mixed blessing, since it stripped the French language of the cross-breeding which characterizes English.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup><b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">

 Mallarmé's sense of English as a language that carries echoes of other languages and layers of historical meaning was shared by Eliot. In an essay on Dante, Eliot comments explicitly on the layering of meaning within English and contrasts it with the lucid quality of Dante's Italian: "In English poetry words have a kind of opacity which is part of their beauty."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> </p>

<p>So the presence of a loose translation of Mallarmé's language within this section of <i>Four Quartets</i> reminds us that Eliot's struggle is not simply with language, but specifically with the English language. It also puts the symbolist poetic legacy, and its appropriation of what Eliot sees as Poe's irresponsible relation to language and its meanings, into relation with Eliot's own struggles with language in <i>Four Quartets</i>. The ghostly stranger talks confidently of the fact that "our concern was speech, and speech impelled us / To purify the dialect of the tribe," but the nature and the ethical significance of this impulsion is never fully articulated. Mallarmé's project of poetical purification is invoked but not endorsed in this section of the poem. The relation between speech and language, particularly, remains unresolved. Mallarmé, after all, had talked only of "les mots" and had not specified whether these words were written or spoken. In translating this as "speech" Eliot appears to ask a question about the poet's responsibility to popular speech that could never really have been asked by Mallarmé, but also that is never fully answered in his own poem. </p>

<p>That this question was of interest to Eliot is in no doubt, as can clearly be seen in two essays Eliot published while working on "Little Gidding." In the first of these, "The Music of Poetry," Eliot explicitly discusses Mallarmé as "one of the more obscure modern poets … of whom the French sometimes say that his language is so peculiar that it can be understood only by foreigners."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The main focus of Eliot's argument, however, is the close relationship between poetry and speech: "it is the poet's business to use the speech which he finds about him" ("Music," 31). He argues that the musicality of poetic language is derived from the music latent in common speech, and also suggests that this constitutes an entirely appropriate limit to forms of poetic innovation, "I do not believe that the task of the poet is primarily and always to effect a revolution in language. It would not be desirable even if it were possible" ("Music," 35). </p>

<p>So the relation between poetic language and common speech would seem for Eliot to constitute a barrier to the project of a pure poetic language. This relation is also the basis on which Eliot imagines a national poetic tradition in his essay on "The Social Function of Poetry": "emotion and feeling, then, are best expressed in the common language of the people … the structure, the rhythm, the sound, the idiom of a language expresses the personality of the people which speaks it."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  So Eliot imagines a poetic language informed by the rhythms and idioms of popular speech and also capable of giving expression to a specifically national structure of feeling. But still, Eliot argues that the responsibility of the poet is not, primarily, to the people, "his direct duty is to his <i>language</i>, first to preserve, and second to extend and improve" ("SF," 20). Preserving and improving the national language are integral to Eliot's poetic project. Writing during the Second World War, Eliot cannot help but be aware of some of the dangers of intact nationalisms, however, and he discusses the imperative for more effective 

<b></b>

 communication between different European nations. He acknowledges that there is "something to be said" for the creation of a lingua franca such as Esperanto or Basic English, but also says, "supposing that all communication between nations was carried on in such an artificial language, how imperfect it would be!" ("SF," 23). Eliot's conviction, finally, is that poetry exists to remind us of the things that can be said only in one language. </p>

3. Lingustic Reform and Poetic Tradition
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The relation between national tradition and poetic language was also important for the work of another modernist writer with an enthusiasm for linguistic innovation, Hugh MacDiarmid, born as Christopher Murray Grieve in Dumfriesshire, Scotland in 1892. After an early career as a journalist he began to publish poetry, and to polemicize for the renewal of Scots language and culture from the early 1920s, adopting his pseudonym in 1922. MacDiarmid's early poetic work was part of the Scottish Renaissance, which drew together an impressive array of literary and cultural historians and critics as well as a range of creative writers. All combined a scholarly passion for Scotland's past with an experimental and innovating commitment to the renewal of early-twentieth-century Scottish literature. Hugh MacDiarmid's first target for linguistic reform was thus, unsurprisingly, the language of the Scots. From an early age he was committed to "adventuring in dictionaries."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In the 1920s, the dictionary in question was Jamieson's <i>Dictionary of the Scottish Language</i>, which MacDiarmid mined for words and phrases that would allow him to construct a version of Scots that combined lyricism and vigor, and would embody what he saw as the enabling precision and robustness of a Medieval Scots associated with the poetic output of William Dunbar. Despairing of what he understood as the linguistic legacy of Sir Walter Scott, and its pernicious impact on Scottish poetry and prose, MacDiarmid worked on the creation of a form of synthetic Scots, which would later be known as "Lallans." MacDiarmid's 1926 collection, <i>A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle</i> is the most powerful expression of this adventure in synthetic Scots, combining a vividly historical imagination with a powerful and bracing lyricism. </p>

<p>MacDiarmid's poetical and political project was both singular and yet collectively enabling, and his writings of the 1920s undoubtedly underpin much subsequent writing in Scots and in Scotland, as well as capturing many of the tensions and contradictions that haunt the modernist project more broadly. The specificity of MacDiarmid's poetical and cultural commitments is well captured by Alan Bold, who writes of him as a nationalist with an often poor opinion of Scotland, a communist with a doubtful enthusiasm for the proletariat, and a social creditor with little knowledge of economics.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The tension between MacDiarmid's assessment of the impoverished state of his contemporary Scottish culture and his confidence in the capacity of Scotland to be the source of cultural and literary renewal can be glimpsed in the following two extracts from his 1943 collection, <i>Lucky Poet</i>: <b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>… But Glasgow's hordes <br />
Are not even literate save a man or two; <br />
All bogged in words that communicate no thought, <br />
Only mumbo-jumbo, fraudulent clap-trap, ballyhoo. <br />
The idiom of which constructive thought avails itself <br />
Is unintelligible save to a small minority	 <br />
And all the rest wallow in exploded fallacies <br />
			——</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->






<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The interests of the real highbrow and the working class are identical—resistance to any intellectual short-circuiting or stereotyping.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Here it is clear that the referential capacity of language is at the heart of MacDiarmid's engagement with his contemporary culture. He sees a proletariat denied the resources of expressive communication, and consequently mired in delusion. Their words cannot communicate thought and they cannot access the idiom of intellectual engagement. Yet MacDiarmid goes on to argue that the proletariat and the intellectual are in fact united through their objective interests in linguistic precision and the overcoming of the stereotype.  </p>

<p>By the early 1930s, MacDiarmid was turning away from his project of writing in Scots, though certainly not his project of writing in some sense for the Scots. His intellectual and political passions had long tended towards the construction of models of unity and of wholeness (a common enough modernist compensatory passion). Indeed, he defines the common threads of his own writing as lying in a commitment to human wholeness, a critique of poverty, and an openness to the whole world of knowledge.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  He argues at various times that such an engagement with international strands of thought and writing are characteristics of Scottish rather than English modernism, pointing out, for example, that the first translators into English of Nietzsche, Proust, Rilke, and Kafka were all Scots.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Such an inclusive and all-encompassing international reach for the culture of Scotland comes to seem increasingly important to MacDiarmid from the 1930s on, as his own writing tends towards the creation of a new poetic language that will be "an all-embracing language, and interpenetration of all languages."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The significance and the necessity of such a world language is explored in MacDiarmid's long poem <i>In Memoriam James Joyce</i>, conceived and largely written during the Second World War. </p>

<p>This text consists of a challenging collage of citation, polemic, and reflection, which constantly returns to linguistics and to language reform as the intellectual core of MacDiarmid's cultural project. MacDiarmid cites within the poem many particular influences on his writing within the world of letters in Britain, notably John Davidson (the poet and proselytizer for Nietzsche) and Charles Doughty, the author of the curious and in many senses anachronistic poem <i>The Dawn in Britain</i> , which was also to have such an impact on the linguistic thinking of Laura Riding.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  But he also invokes linguisticians from Carnap and Saussure to Alexander Murray and "That heroic genius, Antonio Gramsci / Studying comparative linguistics in prison" (<i>IM</i>, 27). MacDiarmid is explicit in his skepticism concerning the possibility of achieving the linguistic range 

<b></b>

 and reach he desires through any project rooted in the linguistic heritage of English literary culture. He dismisses Basic English as a flawed and limited project (<i>IM</i>, 61) and English literary writing more broadly is condemned because it has severed all connection with the people, or as MacDiarmid writes here, with the masses: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>But the arts, and particularly the written arts <br />
Of Great Britain have been forced <br />
By the "highly refined imaginations  <br />
Of the more select classes" <br />
Have been so forced out of all contact with  <br />
Or inspiration from the masses <br />
That, inasmuch as any human manifestation <br />
That is taken in hand by any coterie <br />
Or class of the more select <br />
Must speedily die, <br />
So literature in Anglo-Saxondom <br />
Has, after growing  <br />
More and more provincial, died.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>IM</i>, 122)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">As opposed to this morbid language of a coterie, MacDiarmid seeks in his poem to create a language that is "quick," "sure," "lucid," and with "a quality of fiery aery light" (<i>IM</i>, 88). Joyce, and particularly the late Joyce of <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, is MacDiarmid's exemplar. MacDiarmid reaches out to different literary and philosophical traditions as a means to capture the real historical experience of globalization: "It is now during the second quarter of the twentieth century that we are aware of the appearance of a literature which assumes that the world is an indivisible unit," and "the differences between languages and cultures begin to grow less marked to one who is accustomed to contemplating the unity of the human spirit" (<i>IM</i>, 14). MacDiarmid is concerned here, in a gesture towards Eliot, with "the living whole of all the poetry that has ever been written" (<i>IM</i>, 20) and also with the "unity of thing and word / Of feeling and its articulation" (<i>IM</i>, 49). He writes with Joyce in the recognition of the diverse myths and languages that might subtend the recognition that "our consciousness is beginning to be planetary" (<i>IM</i>, 14). </p>

<p>But (and this is cruelly to curtail a proper analytic discussion of this poem) despite its commitment to precision, to inclusiveness, and to the "progressive articulation of the world" (<i>IM</i>, 5), MacDiarmid's formidable text remains a daunting interpretative challenge. If Basic English's international aspirations were limited and limiting, MacDiarmid's world language is limitless but ultimately both frustrating and frustrated. The wrestle with language as an expression of a concrete history gives way in MacDiarmid's poem to a more abstract and ultimately solipsistic endeavor to create a world language. But it remains uncertain whether this language can ever really be shared, even with the very particular community of readers of modernist poetry or modernist poetics. Here, perhaps, we reach a limit of modernist linguistic reform in the creation of a poetic language that cannot generate shared meanings and shared histories through the process of reading.

Introduction
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>When the Austrian critic René Fülöp-Miller set out to account for the increasing appeal of Hollywood film in his 1931 study <i>Die Phantasiemaschine </i>(<i>The Fantasy Machine</i>), one explanation that seemed to lie ready-at-hand was that of film's "optical rhythms" (<i>optische Rhythmik</i>). Pointing both to the physiological rhythm constituted by the succession of twenty-four frames per second and to the rhythms represented on the screen, Fülöp-Miller argued that rhythm in the cinema acted as a subliminal, suggestive force: "How difficult it is to turn your eyes from the screen!"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  But while the cinema might represent a new technology, its irresistible rhythms in fact constituted a modern manifestation of a much more primitive and vital <i>Urrhythmus, </i>a primal rhythm that had animated all art forms from Homeric times to the present: "From the dawn of time, the primal rhythm created by the embrace of the sexes has brought forth all art, and this primal rhythm is now said to celebrate its resurrection—in a form corresponding to our own epoch—in film."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>For anyone familiar with the discussions of avant-garde filmmakers and critics from the 1920s, Fülöp-Miller's euphoric celebration of filmic rhythm no doubt evokes a whole host of utopian associations. Like other key concepts from the early cinema debates such as that of a "universal language" or an art of "hieroglyphs," the notion of cinema as an art of "rhythm" was suffused with the sorts of progressive aspirations that broadly defined what Gilles Deleuze called the cinema of the "movement image" in the years before the Second World War.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  By the time Fülöp-Miller published <i>Die Phantasiemaschine </i><i>, </i>the notion of film as an art of rhythm already had a long history among the filmic avant-garde of the 1920s. Most specifically, as Standish Lawder demonstrated in his seminal book <i>The Cubist Cinema</i>, it emerged in the wake of Abel Gance's 1922 film <i>La roue, </i>in which Gance and then editor, Blaise Cendrars, introduced the accelerated montage sequences that would come to characterize French filmmaking throughout the decade.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  For younger filmmakers such as Germaine Dulac, Jean Epstein, Fernand Léger and Marcel L'Herbier, the real "story" of <i>La roue </i>lay not in the narrative of a train conductor's illicit desire for his adoptive daughter, but rather in the film's <i>rhythmical editing itself</i>, which they saw as a demonstration of the cinema's unique ability to capture modern experience. Léger, in particular, as Lawder has shown, seems to have drawn upon the montage of the train in <i>La roue </i>for his own famous experiments in rhythmical filmmaking in <i>Ballet mécanique </i>, in which the rhythmical movements of human bodies and industrial objects are juxtaposed in an effort to underscore "the reaction of man to his mechanical environment."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Certainly, the appeal exerted by the very fantasy of a rhythmical cinema on avant-garde artists stemmed in large part from a problem of legitimacy: the cinema's ability to visualize movement differentiated it not only from literature, but also from painting and static photography and so seemed to offer a key to claiming a unique aesthetic domain. This desire to construct a specificity of cinematic aesthetics has often been cited to explain the vehemence with which directors sought to valorize abstract form over concrete content, defining avant-garde cinema effectively as an anti-mimetic art and severing it from the realm of referentiality. But the excitement about "rhythm" in the 1920s cannot be explained by aesthetic concerns alone. In what follows, I wish to show this by examining the relationship between "rhythm" as a term of filmic aesthetics and a much broader discussion of rhythm, the body and modernity in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. While such a cultural-historical investigation will never allow us to attach any unambiguous denotative meaning to the images of "pure cinema," it might help better to understand the stakes behind the desire to reduce film to its rhythmic component.  </p>

<p>For the proponents of the abstract film, that desire was thoroughly bound up with a belief that rhythmical movement could appeal directly to the emotions, bypassing rational intellection, as it were, by eliminating the conscious content of plot. The desire for such an affective appeal was precisely what motivated Germaine Dulac, for example, to praise Gance's rhythmical experiments in <i>La roue </i>in her 1926 book <i>L'art cinématographique </i>and call for a further reduction of the cinema to purely abstract rhythmical movement: "Can lines unwinding in profusion according to a rhythm [ . . . ] not affect one's emotions by themselves, without sets, solely through the activity of

their development?"<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  While Dulac's call to divest film of plots recalls Léger's <i>Ballet mécanique, </i>her question about the emotional appeal of purely abstract forms set into rhythm also recalls other experiments occurring across the Rhine—most notably Hans Richter's abstract rhythmical studies <i>Film ist Rhythmus </i>(later renamed as <i>Rhythmus 1921 </i>for the year in which it appeared), <i>Rhythmus 1923 </i>and <i>Rhythmus 1925, </i>in which Richter animated abstract rectangular shapes over a blank background. Like Dulac, Richter—who as a painter involved with the Zurich Dada movement had long sought to create a "universal language" of pure forms—saw the reduction of cinema to abstract optical rhythms as a means of bringing the medium into its essence: "Rhythm, tempo and cadence [ . . . ]: the new film resides in the significance that details lend to the plastic object and its movement—that is, precisely in that which occurred unconsciously and haphazardly alongside the action, the actors and the scenery."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  But like Dulac, Richter also saw in rhythm a means of affecting the spectator <i>bodily</i> by accessing the elementary laws of sensation and emotion. In an article for the influential ex-patriot journal <i>Little Review </i>from 1926 entitled "Rhythm," Richter described rhythm as "the essence of emotional expression," "the inner nature-force [ . . . ], through which we are bound up with the elemental nature-forces."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Rhythmical composition thus seemed to offer a direct route to the spectator's emotional life without the detour through characters, story and setting: "This film here offers no 'stopping points,' at which one could look back through memory. The viewer is—exposed—forced to 'feel'—to go along with the rhythm—breathing—heartbeat: — . . . through its rising and sinking, the rhythm makes clear <i>what </i>it really means to feel and sense . . . a process—movement."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Like Fülöp-Miller's characterization of filmic rhythm as a modern avatar of a vitalistic "primal rhythm<i>,</i>" Dulac and Richter's insistence on the link between rhythm, emotion and sensation also points to a broader connection between questions of filmic aesthetics, on the one hand, and the modern understanding of the body on the other. In what follows, I wish to explore this connection more closely, particularly as it played out among German intellectuals. After examining the broader interstices between discourses on the body and discourses on film, I will then turn to an extended reading of one film that encapsulates some of the central stakes of the rhythm debates: Fritz Lang's <i>Metropolis</i>. </p>

<p>Coinciding with the emergence of cinematic technology itself around 1900, the very term "rhythm" came to play a key role in European modernity's understanding of the relation between the body and technology. Any investigation into this broader understanding of rhythm and modernity would have to begin with the immensely influential study <i>Arbeit und Rhythmus </i>(<i>Work and Rhythm</i>)<i>, </i>published in 1896 by the economist Karl Bücher. Concerned above all with the effects of industrial labor on the working body, Bücher relied on ethnographic sources and his own observations of exotic "human zoos" at the World Exhibition in Paris to undertake a systematic survey of pre-industrial and 'primitive' work forms. The result, in his own words, was the rediscovery of a "lost world" of "joyous work [<i>fröhliche Arbeit</i>]," one diametrically opposed to the alienated labor of modern industrial societies.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  For Bücher, the key difference between the two forms of work resided not only in the introduction of the division of labor, but also and most centrally in the role of the <i>body. </i>The "joyous work" of traditional societies was a form of labor attuned—in its duration and tempo—to the body's organic rhythms, which Bücher saw expressed in chants, songs, spirituals, hand-clapping, foot-stomping and the like. But whereas traditional societies had used the body's rhythms to guide the tools of labor, industrial society had subordinated the body itself to the rhythm of machines, with their fixed work schedule and—above all—their accelerated tempo. The body, Bücher concluded, had become a servant of its own tools: "The working man is no longer master of his own movements. His tools no longer act as his servants, as enhanced bodily limbs. Rather, the tools now lord it over him. They dictate to him the measure of his movements. The speed and duration of his labor no longer obey his will."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  For Bücher, the predicament of modern work, particularly in its Tayloristic variants, resided first and foremost in the problem of tempo: the rhythms of industry had left those of the body behind.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Bücher's focus on "rhythm" as the mark of bodily being formed part of a much broader medical mapping of the body as a network of organic "rhythms" by physiologists and psychologists around the turn of the century.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  But it was <i>Arbeit und Rhythmus, </i>more than any other study on the subject, which helped to catalyze debates about tempo and bodily experience in the industrial world.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  More broadly, one might say, Bücher's study provided a new vocabulary for conceptualizing modernity in terms of accelerated rhythms. Thus in his famous essay "Die Großstädte und das Geistesleben" ("The Metropolis and Mental Life," 1903), Georg Simmel saw <i>rhythm</i> as one of the decisive factors distinguishing rural and city life. In small towns, Simmel wrote, "the rhythm of life and sensory mental imagery flows more slowly, more habitually, and more evenly" than in the metropolis.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  As suggested by Simmel's own famous characterization of the city as an "intensification of nervous life," this sense of having lost touch with natural rhythms was directly linked to the question of neurasthenia. Precisely the desire to counter neurasthenia gave rise to a whole array of reform movements designed to reawaken the body's natural rhythms. The eurhythmical dance teacher Emil Jaques-Dalcroze, for example, used the terms "Neurasthenia" and "Arhythmia" (<i>Arhythmie</i>) synonymously and explicitly drew on Bücher's work while formulating his system of eurhythmical gymnastics in the 1910s.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Around the same time, rhythm 

<b></b>

also became a key topic in theosophical and anthroposophical circles, where Rudolf Steiner developed his own system of eurhythmical gymnastics in 1912, designed to "set modern nerves back to earlier states."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In his book <i>Das Gesundheitsproblem: der Rhythmus des Lebens </i>(<i>Health and the Rhythm of Life</i>) from 1912, the English theosophist Archibald Keightley broadly summarized the understanding of the "rhythm problem" among cultural reformers when he asked: "'Have we kept up with the real rhythm of life?' I do not believe so! Many—and probably most—people today suffer from some sort of physical, nervous and mental agitation. They can control neither themselves, nor the circumstances of their lives, which in one way or another are too much for them."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  </p>

<p>It would be difficult to overlook the connection between the experience of modernization in terms of accelerated rhythms and the fascination with accelerated montage in 1920s cinema. To take one of the best-known examples from the German context, Walter Ruttmann's 1927 film <i>Berlin. Die Sinfonie der Großstadt </i>(<i>Berlin. The Symphony of a Great City</i>) constructs its vision of urban modernity through the motif of accelerating rhythms right from the opening sequence. Beginning the film with an establishing shot of slowly lapping waves, Ruttmann quickly interrupts this scene of natural motion with a superimposition of two abstract geometric res—themselves reminiscent of Richter's rhythm films as well as Ruttmann's own abstract films such as the surviving <i>Opus 1 </i>—that begin to turn at an increasingly accelerated pace. In a graphic match-cut, these res then morph into a rapid montage sequence of a train on its way to Berlin. With its rapid and hard cuts between shots of furiously turning wheels, speeding tracks and telephone lines, all set to a fast-paced rhythmical musical score, Ruttmann's train montage appears as an almost direct citation of Abel Gance's <i>La roue</i>. Through such interfilmic references, Ruttmann suggests a vision of filmic montage as a particularly apt medium for capturing an experience of modernity as the overcoming of natural rhythms.  </p>

<p>Nor is the focus on acceleration by any means limited to this opening sequence, but rather returns like a leitmotif throughout <i>Berlin. The Symphony of a Great City</i>. To take one example, at the end of the second act, in a sequence linking acceleration to the rise of mass communications, Ruttmann inserts an accelerated montage sequence in which female typists and telephone operators can be seen working furiously as the typewriters and switchboards begin to spin in circles. As Joachim Radkau has shown, the nervous system itself was often compared to a vast system of telephone (or telegraph) wires, and telephone operators were thought to be particularly susceptible to neurasthenia and hysteria.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In this sense, this entire sequence can already be read as a metaphor for the modern nervous system, overloaded by its exposure to the accelerated rhythms of industrial life. As the rhythm of this montage sequence continues to accelerate, Ruttmann drives the point home by inserting shots of screaming monkeys and ting dogs in a textbook example of Eisensteinian "intellectual" montage. Unable to exert any self-control, the animals here function as symbols for the nervous inhabitants of the metropolis, in a manner analogous to the slaughtered cows Eisenstein inserted into the final scene of <i>Strike </i>to illustrate the repression of the striking workers. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>If the montage of telephone operators represents the height of acceleration during the morning shift, another key image of acceleration will come after the lunch break. In a sequence set off by images of the printing press turning out newspapers,<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Ruttmann underscores, on a clearly symbolic level, the dangers of surpassing the body's organic rhythms. In shots reminiscent of Richter's short film <i>Inflation</i> from the same year , the animated word <i>Geld </i>(<i>Money</i>) flies repeatedly toward the spectator in an accelerating rhythmical succession. This is then followed by another sequence of intellectual montage, unfolding in an ever-increasing tempo and associating images of a building storm, whirling shots taken from within a moving roller coaster, and the electrified eyes of a woman who looks down from a city bridge as she prepares to jump to her death. </p>

<p>Siegfried Kracauer, in his own reading of Ruttmann's <i>Berlin</i> film in <i>From Caligari to Hitler, </i>criticizes Ruttmann for what he sees as an overindulgence in formalistic rhythmical compositions that overshadow any concern with the denotative referents of the individual images.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Indeed, as David Macrae observes, Kracauer uses the terms "rhythm" and "reality" in strict opposition, so that rhythmical formalism would signify a flight from social concerns into a kind of new objective <i>l'art pour l'art</i>.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Defending Ruttmann against Kracauer's critique, Macrae rightly suggests that the social significance of the film might be sought precisely at the formal level itself, rather than falling into any either-or oppositions between denotative content and formalistic games. For Macrae, <i>Berlin</i> would practice a kind of Eisensteinian "collision and interaction of multiple layers of visual signification," producing "a transcendental level of signification" through the combination, arrangement and juxtaposition of different elements.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In my own reading, however, I would suggest that we look for the film's cultural-historical significance at the level of Ruttmann's <i>temporal </i>compositions, and more specifically in his manipulation of tempo<i>. </i>Given the centrality of "rhythm" as a category for German modernity's understanding of its own experience, it seems crucial to me to understand how <i>Berlin</i> comments on that experience through the very use of accelerated montage<i>.</i> Far from a formalist game, Ruttmann's montage performs a kind of mimesis of the very industrial tempo that so preoccupied writers on rhythm since Bücher. While Ruttmann's rhythms might not carry any denotative meaning in themselves, they do carry a <i>connotative </i>one, gesturing toward a much broader perception of the disjuncture between organic and technological rhythms in the modern world. </p>

<p>But while the aspect of acceleration played an important role in the rhythm debates, it was not the only question at stake. Coming in the wake of Ferdinand Tönnies's classic study of modern anomie, <i>Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft </i>from 1887<i>, </i>Bücher's vision of collective, rhythmical labor also represented a fantasy of community, one opposed to the growing sense of isolation and anonymity accompanying life in the city.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  At the same time, however, it was only a step from Bücher's rhythmical collective labor, with its workers all performing the same gestures in unisons, to the mass ornaments and serialized movements that would come to be associated with industrial work and urban entertainment.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The question of how to distinguish 'rhythm' from sterile seriality would come to occupy an increasingly important place within the rhythm debates after Bücher, especially in the domain of vitalist philosophy<i>, </i>and it stood at the center of the most influential work on the subject from the 1920s: <i>Das Wesen des Rhythmus</i> (<i>The Nature of Rhythm</i>) by Ludwig Klages .<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Written specifically for a convention of body culture schools in Berlin (the <i>Tagung für künstlerische Körperschulung</i>), Klages's essay quickly became a central reference point for discussion on rhythm and the body. In it, he sought to demonstrate what he saw as the irreconcilable opposition between organic and machinic rhythms—or in his terminology between <i>Rhythmus</i> and <i>Takt</i>.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  For Klages, "rhythm" resided not in the succession of identical elements characteristic of mass production,<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  but rather precisely in the <i>deviations</i> from mechanical succession. Visible in biological processes (e.g., heartbeat, breath) and diurnal cycles (planets, tides, etc.), rhythm expressed the essence of life,<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  while <i>Takt</i> made visible the rational, ordering and segmenting activity of the intellect (or "spirit"—<i>Geist</i>—in Klages's terminology).<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  In terms of the experience of time, rhythm could express the flux of becoming in a manner reminiscent of Bergsonian <i>durée</i>, while <i>Takt</i> emphasized the artificial divisions of time into discreet segments. Where <i>Takt</i> could best be observed in the staccato movement of clocks, metronomes, and pendulums, rhythm found its most perfect phenomenal expression in the undulating flow of waves: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The crests and valleys [of waves] correspond to the pendulum's delimiting strokes [<i>begrenzende Schläge</i>]. But here, the boundaries are not clearly marked. [ . . . ] The upward movement glides into the downward movement and vice versa in such a way that neither the upper nor lower turning points display any hard edges. What appears is rather a curve, which clearly shows us the unsegmented continuity [<i>unzergrenzte Stetigkeit</i>] of a movement that is nonetheless structured.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">For Klages, the real "nature of rhythm"—the etymology of which he locates in the Greek verb <i>rheein </i>or "to flow"<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> —resided precisely in this quality of continuity (<i>Stetigkeit</i>), which he opposed to the segmentation of time through the imposition of temporal pauses and clearly defined boundaries. The goal of vitalist phenomenology was to access the Dionysian world of rhythm hidden below the machinic <i>Takt</i> of modernity.  </p>

<p>Returning briefly to Ruttmann's <i>Berlin. The Symphony of a Great City, </i>it might not be by chance that Ruttmann chose to begin with an image of slowly lapping waves. In a film intent on drawing parallels between the movement of human bodies in the city and that of machines and automatons in repetitive motion, the transition from 

<b></b>

organic movement of the waves to the precision cutting of the train sequence could be read as a kind of rudimentary narrative of modernity. Modernity, in Ruttmann's <i>Berlin, </i>would involve the expulsion from the warm folds of Klagesian rhythm into the cold and "sober" domain of mechanical <i>Takt</i>, a <i>Takt </i>embodied by the mass ornaments that increasingly come to dominate Ruttmann's film in the entertainment sequence toward the end [<a href="#1">re 1</a>]. </p>

<p>In staging modernity as the definitive overcoming of Klagesian rhythm, <i>Berlin. Symphony of a Great City </i>could be read as an answer of sorts to another popular film from two years earlier no less preoccupied with questions of rhythm and filmic representation: Wilhelm Prager's body culture showcase <i>Wege zu Kraft und Schönheit </i>(<i>Paths to Strength and Beauty</i>) from 1925. Where Ruttmann's film begins with an image of flowing rhythm only to catapult the viewer into a world of accelerated, mechanized movements, <i>Paths to Strength and Beauty </i>opens with a demonstration of nervous mechanization only to proclaim, subsequently, the restoration of organic rhythm. Before showing a single image of beautiful bodies, Prager's film opens with an extended vision of urban modernity as a neurasthenic nightmare.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  We see images of a bourgeois family caught in the throws of nervous convulsions and shot in a rapid and abrupt montage style reminiscent of Gance; an impressionist collage of superimposed images of hustling city traffic; and endless tracking shots showing lines of workers attached to oppressive factory machines. Clearly, Prager's film presents body culture as an answer to modernity's neurasthenic dilemma, and among the demonstrations of body culture that follow, he includes an entire section on eurhythmical gymnastics and dance. Here too, we see a Klagesian subtext when Prager introduces this sequence with a shot of ocean waves and flowing fields—both paradigmatic manifestations of rhythm for Klages<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> —followed by an intertitle reading: "Movements are made beautiful by rhythm. This is a law of nature." The section that follows illustrates all of the most important schools in rhythmical dance and gymnastics, including (among others) Jaques-Dalcroze, Rudolf von Laban, Mary Wigman, Rudolf Bode and the Loheland School.  </p>

<p>Many of the performers included in the "rhythm" section of <i>Paths to Strength and Beauty </i>would have adhered to Klages's theories, and the film certainly presents eurhythmics as a whole as part of Klagesian project to access the body's primal rhythmical flows. Most of the exercises shown consist of flowing bodily movements, and some performances are even staged at the edge of a lake in front the lapping waves [<a href="#2">re 2</a>]. Perhaps the most ardent of Klages's supporters shown in the film was Rudolf Bode, the volkish dance reformer who would go on to become a leading re in the physical education bureaucracy of the Third Reich.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  In his study <i>Rhythmus und Körpererziehung </i>(<i>Rhythm and Bodily Education</i>, 1925), Bode described modernization as a process of "derhythmification" ("<i>Entrhythmisierungsprozeß</i>"), in which the body's rhythmical life-force had been suppressed under a regime of technological <i>Takt</i>.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Only eurhythmical gymnastics, Bode argued, could liberate the flow of primal rhythm. Opposed as this section of Prager's film is to the images of mechanization with which the film opens, it clearly intended to visualize such a liberation through the motion picture medium. In that, Prager's film largely portends the flowing images

of calisthenics and divers that Leni Riefenstahl would later produce in her account of the 1936 Berlin Olympics.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  </p>

<p>At least on one level, then, both <i>Berlin. The Symphony of a Great City</i> and <i>Paths to Strength and Beauty </i>were really about the opposition between machinic <i>Takt</i> and organic rhythm, even if the films opted, as it were, for different sides of the opposition. But the stakes of this opposition and of the broader discourse on rhythm, I would argue, extend well beyond the content of these two films to touch upon one of the central questions behind thinking about the cinema as a temporal medium in the 1920s. Examining writings on filmic aesthetics from the 1920s, one is struck by the extent to which the very body cultural discourses I have been exploring here serve as a point of reference in discussions about filmic rhythm. A case in point can be seen in the re of Sergei Eisenstein. In his essay "The Dramaturgy of Film Form" , Eisenstein described "rhythm" as the central dynamic force animating "every art form and [ . . . ] every form of its expression."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Using the term "rhythm" nearly synonymously with his key concept of "conflict," Eisenstein defined rhythm as the result of a tension between the organic and the technological, "formlessness" and "rational form" or "nature and industry."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  In poetry, he argued, this rhythmical dynamic translates into a "conflict between the metric measure adopted and the distribution of sounds that ambushes that measure."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Analogously, Eisenstein locates the "rhythm" of filmic montage in the dynamic conflict between the metrical regularity of shot lengths and the distribution of movement within the individual shots. Precisely this concept of rhythm as a dynamic tension between metric and organic elements stood at the center of Eisenstein's critique of quantitative models of rhythmical montage such as that of Pudovkin: "We cannot characterize this kind of relationship between lengths [proposed by Pudovkin] as rhythm."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In formulating his model of rhythmical montage, Eisenstein draws an explicit analogy to the debates already underway in body cultural circles. Although he faults Klages for the latter's one-sided focus on the irrational, Eisenstein's concept of rhythm as a struggle between the organic and the technological clearly bears some affinities with Klages's distinction between flowing rhythm and mechanical <i>Takt</i>. Accordingly, in comparing his own model of dynamic rhythm to Pudovkin's metrical concept of shot lengths, Eisenstein looks for authority to none other than Rudolf Bode, whose Klagesian understanding of eurhythmical gymnastics he opposes to the quantitative muscle training of the popular American calisthenics teacher Bess Mensendieck. Pudovkin's effort to equate rhythm with the mathematical determination of shot duration, Eisenstein argues, "would give rise to a metre that was as opposed to rhythm as such as the mechanical-metric Mesendieck system is opposed to the organic-rhythmic Bode school in matters of bodily expression."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Passages such as this suggest the extent to which Eisenstein's notion of filmic "conflict," while derived from Marxian dialectics, also resonated with the vitalist models of rhythm so important for the early 20<sup>th</sup> century's understanding of the body.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  </p>

<p>That filmmakers would take an interest in the opposition between rhythm and <i>Takt</i> should hardly come as a surprise. At stake in that opposition was a question of movement and time already articulated in the philosophy of Henri Bergson. Indeed, as Christine 

<b></b>

Lubkoll has argued, Bergson's efforts to distinguish between analytic conceptions of time as a series of fixed points and the experience of becoming as durée must be seen as one of the key sources for the model of rhythm proposed by Klages, with its opposition between flowing and punctual movements.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  As is well known, Bergson considered the cinematographic filmstrip the very model of a punctualized, spatialized conception of movement as a series of static points, whereas authentic movement consisted in the continuum of development between the points. In his <i>Creative Evolution, </i>Bergson compared the intellect, with its tendency to spatialize movement and becoming into so many static points on a line, to an interior strip of film. </p>

<p>More recently, Gilles Deleuze has attempted to defend the cinema against Bergson's critique. In his 1983 study on the "movement-image" in early cinema, Deleuze argued that Bergson himself had access only to the earliest films, shot with stationary cameras before a static stage. With the development of montage and mobile camera work, however, subsequent filmmakers would increasingly explore the possibilities of motion pictures to represent movement as a formless flow.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Deleuze's distinction between a (pre-WWII) "movement image" and a (post-WWII) "time-image" has been the subject of some critique, and it is not my intention to take up this debate here.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  But I <i>do </i>wish to recall the extent to which Deleuze saw the film of the 1920s—and particularly the avant-garde experiments in rhythmical filmmaking—as a series of eminently Bergsonian experiments: namely an effort to return to a primary state of pure movement or "universal variation" described by Bergson in the first chapter of <i>Matière et mémoire</i>.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  For Deleuze, the cinema of the "movement image" is almost inherently Bergsonian, tending quasi-teleologically toward the restoration of pre-subjective "gaseous" states of pure movement.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  In order to demonstrate this conception, it might not be by chance that Deleuze himself focuses on the predilection of experimental filmmakers for the beloved motif of water:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Water is the quintessential milieu in which one can extract movement from the object moved and show the mobility of movement itself. Hence the importance of water as a visual and auditory element in rhythmical experiments. What [Abel] Gance had begun with his images of railroads would find its continuation—transmitted and diffused in all directions—precisely in the liquid element. In his own experiments, Jean Mitry started by filming the railroad (in <i>Pacific 231</i>) and then turned to water (in <i>Images pour Debussy</i>) in the hopes of delivering a more profound image of reality as pure vibration. The documentary work of Jean Grémillon passes through the same stages, from the mechanics of solids to the mechanics of fluids, from industry to the marine element underneath [<i>à son arrière-fond marin</i>].<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> </p>

<p>Deleuze's claims about the Bergsonian possibilities of early cinema have been echoed by other contemporary critics, most recently by Tom Gunning in his reading of Loïe Fuller's Serpentine Dances as a Bergsonian flow of uninterrupted movement.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  In 

<b></b>

citing these arguments, my own point is not to take sides in the debate as to whether the filmic medium in itself has access to the world of flowing rhythms or whether it is bound to the world of division, seriality and <i>Takt</i>. But I do wish to underline the ongoing pertinence of a question about the filmic medium that I have been attempting to delineate from films and film theory in the 1920s. If that question has remained so central to our understanding cinematic aesthetics, I would argue that the reason for this might lie precisely in the cinema's ambiguity. As an "art of the machine," film seemed to be bound up with the tempo of modern technology and—as Walter Benjamin argued—with the aesthetics of fragmentation and seriality. However, as an "art of motion," in Gunning's phrase, the cinema's animated pictures also seemed to hold out the promise of recapturing the movement of life in its most vitalistic aspect.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Precisely in this ambiguity, the cinema seemed to embody what Christine Lubkoll has identified as the general function of rhythm in the modern imagination since Bergson: that of a dynamic "interface" (<i>Schnittstelle</i>), "in which nature crosses over into culture and culture can also point back to nature."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  As we will see, this concept of rhythm—and the rhythmical cinema—as an interface between nature and culture underlay an extended reflection on rhythm, body and film in Fritz Lang's <i>Metropolis. </i> </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Rhythm in <i>Metropolis </i>
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Although widely criticized upon its release in 1927 for what viewers saw as a contrived plot, <i>Metropolis </i>was almost universally praised for its formal visual constructions, particularly its choreography of movement. In an article for <i>La gazeta literaria de Madrid</i>, for example, Luis Buñuel exclaimed: "What a captivating symphony of movement! How the engines sing amidst wonderful transparent triumphal arches formed by electric charges! [ . . . ] [T]he rhythmic succession of wheels, pistons [and] mechanical forms is an admirable ode, a new poetry to our eyes. Physics and chemistry are miraculously transformed into rhythm."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Although <i>Metropolis</i> has rarely been seen as part of the project for a rhythmical cinema, a glance at the critical reception such as that of Buñuel suggests that it ought to be read at least in part within this context. After all, Lang's film focuses on the central question at stake in the broader rhythm debates: namely that of the limits between technology and organic life.  </p>

<p>In its attempt to articulate those limits, moreover, the film employs a thoroughly Klagesian opposition. Right from its opening sequence, <i>Metropolis</i> stages industrial modernity as a regime of machinic <i>Takt</i> in Klages's sense. After an initial montage of pistons, flywheels and gears in repetitive movement, the film zeros in on a shot of the 10-hour work-clock that organizes the time of the city. In fact, what we see are two clocks: The first, marked with twenty-four hours, appears to retain some connection to the rhythms of diurnal time. Below it, however, the face of the rationalized 10-hour clock looms some five times as large. To the difference of the diurnal clock, which features only the hour and minute hands, the 10-hour clock is distinguished by the marked presence of two rapidly flashing lights and a second hand, which races around the clock face in a jerky, staccato movement.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Recalling Klages's definition of <i>Takt</i> as a motion emphasizing the segmenting of time through the imposition of temporal boundaries into the flow of rhythm, the staccato movement of the second hand defines a pattern that will be repeated throughout the film—and nowhere more explicitly than in the choreography of working bodies. In the sequence immediately following the shot of the two clocks, the film cuts to the machine halls underground, where two lines of serialized workers can be seen walking in different directions, their highly stylized, staccato gait recalling the movement of the second hand from the previous scene. Soon after these shots, we then see what exactly has transformed the workers' bodies when Freder catches his first glimpse of the machine hall in the famous "Moloch" sequence. From Freder's point of view, we observe the workers twitch back and forth like pendulums in a mechanical dance [<a href="#3">re 3</a>]. Through this meticulous choreography of cadenced bodily movement, <i>Metropolis </i>constructs modernization in a manner similar to that of Klages and the proponents of eurhythmical body culture. Modernization, here, appears as a process entailing the temporal disciplining of the body through a regime of industrial <i>Takt, </i>where the body's natural rhythms are subordinated to the rhythms and the tempo of the industrial clock.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Indeed, this model of the suppression of rhythm by <i>Takt</i> informs not only the representation of the workers' bodies in <i>Metropolis, </i>but also that of the city itself, which is repeatedly red as a kind of meta-body suffering under the tyranny of the intellect. While this motif of the city as body comes out most distinctly in the repeated allegory of the head and the hands, it is also inscribed into the city's very geographic layout. In Thea von Harbou's novel version of <i>Metropolis, </i>the narrator recounts how Fredersen, the head of Metropolis, originally built his city over an ancient river, which he had damned up, but which constantly threatens to flood over again.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The novel then ends with the liberation of this vital source in the form of a cathartic flood, which Harbou celebrates as a metaphor for the return of life to a rigidified modern body: "The stones of the dead city came to life."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  In this, the city undergoes a process directly parallel to Joe Fredersen himself. Repeatedly, the hyperintellectual Fredersen is compared to a block of stone erected over an ancient source, and the novel culminates with Maria describing Fredersen's healing process in terms of water flooding breaking through rigid stone. "Oh Freder!" Maria exclaims to Fredersen's son. "As your father stood here, it was as if I could hear a source rumbling beneath the stone [<i>als hörte ich eine Quelle in einem Felsen rauschen</i>]. The water was red with blood and heavy with salt. And I knew that if this source gained enough strength to break through the stone, it would be sweeter than dew and whiter than light."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Harbou's allegory of rationalization as the suppression of flowing sources under the rigid stone of urban architecture recalls nothing so much as the vitalist discourse on modernization as the repression of primal rhythms. In his <i>Rhythmus und Körpererziehung </i>, for example, Bode repeatedly resorted to the allegory of an ancient source covered over by blocks of stone to describe the process of "derhythmification" that eurhythmical gymnastics would help to overcome. Bode compared the liberation of the body's repressed rhythms to the unleashing of this source in the form of a 

<b></b>

vitalistic flood<i>, </i>which would tear down all of the barriers erected by the intellect in its segmentation of nature. "All we can do," Bode explained,  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>is to clear the way in case the wave of life [<i>Woge des Lebens</i>] should rise up again to assault the fortress of rationalism, flooding it with the forms of rhythmically moving life [<i>es überflutend mit den Formen rhythmisch bewegten Lebens</i>]. Whether this flood will come, whether this wave will crash once again, we cannot know. We can only point to symptoms that suggest that the flood [<i>Flut</i>] is rising.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  </p>

<p class="continued">But such a cathartic destruction of the architecture of rationality, Bode argued, would be possible only if the rhythmical source of life had not already dried up: "Where the water of life has definitively run dry, no removal of stone rubble our boulders [<i>Felsengeröll</i>] can create a source [<i>Quelle</i>] of bubbling rhythm."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Clearly, Harbou's novel sought to stage a similar cathartic movement to that of the dance reformers—right down to the "tanzendes Mädchen" that leads the crowd during the destruction of the city.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  The novel's obsessive preoccupation with stone and vital waters clearly also provided the groundwork for the famous flood sequence in the film version of <i>Metropolis. </i>Most specifically, the film recalls Harbou's allegory of the buried spring in the many images of water smashing through the geometric stone buildings of the underground city [<a href="#4">re 4</a>]. But while the film retains Harbou's critique of rationality, it largely plays down the positive connotations of the flood to present the unleashing of vital forces more specifically as a source of danger. Like the novel, the film draws a direct parallel between the images of flooding water and the 

<b></b>

movement of the revolting workers as they tear down every barrier on their unstoppable flow toward the machine rooms.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  And this formless flowing mass is, of course, unmistakably coded as feminine, marked as it is by the presence of the workers' wives, who appear in this scene for the first time in the film. If this characterization of the masses as a feminine flood recalls the paranoid male fantasies investigated by Klaus Theweleit, it also recalls the understanding of primal rhythm by reformers like Bode, who championed the rhythms of nature as a feminine, liquid element opposed to the masculine activity of rational segmentation.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  </p>

<p>And yet, if Lang presents this Dionysian flood as a force no less threatening than the rigid regime of <i>Takt</i> it opposes, the film does attempt to imagine a kind of productive relation between the two poles: according to the central motto, it is the <i>heart </i>that ought to mediate between the intellect and the body. Certainly the topos of the mediating heart in <i>Metropolis </i>functions on one level as a metaphor for the cinema itself, which Lang largely understood—under the influence of Bela Balázs—as a forum for mediating linguistic, social and cultural barriers through the establishment of a universal language of gestures and expressions. We first encounter the re of the mediating heart in Maria's catacomb sermon on the Tower of Babel, which offers an allegory of <i>Metropolis </i>itself in its call for mediation between the classes, and which is presented as a kind of film within the film.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  In what follows, however, I would like to suggest that <i>Metropolis </i>also attempts to imagine motion pictures as a forum for mediating between technological and organic rhythms—and that the pulsating heart forms a metaphor for <i>this</i> mediating function.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>To see this, we need to look more closely at the web of heart imagery recurring throughout the film, starting with the famous "heart machine" at the center of the city's technological apparatus. In her novel, Harbou describes the heart machine as a pumping mechanism, audible throughout the underground city as a "beating pulse" (<i>Pulsschlag</i>), which functions to keep the danger of flooding in check by continually pumping away the excess water building up beneath the city.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Thus mediating between technology and the forces of nature by imposing rhythmical order over nature's dangerous flows, Fredersen's allegorical city itself can be seen to embody a certain fantasy of cinematic movement as a constructivist machine for controlling the rhythms of nature. </p>

<p>This interpretation becomes even more plausible when one considers the design for the heart machine in <i>Metropolis. </i>As Standish Lawder long ago remarked, the appearance of Lang's heart machine, with its circular form featuring groups of four hooked lines on the outer edges [<a href="#5">re 5</a>], makes an unmistakable reference to a specific work of rhythmical filmmaking: namely the 1923 film <i>L'Inhumaine </i>(<i>The Inhuman Woman</i>) by Marcel L'Herbier. There—in lavish sets designed by Fernand Léger himself—a similar design adorns the centerpiece of the laboratory of the engineer Einar Norsen: a machine for "reanimating the heart of the deceased," as Einar explains in one scene. L'Herbier's film tells the story of the concert singer and femme fatale Claire Lescot, whose ruthlessness toward her male suitors is matched only by her penchant for "primitive" sexuality. Throughout the early part of the film, Claire can be seen giving bizarre soirées, in which black performers dressed in tribal attire entertain her with rhythmical dances, filmed in chaotic accelerated montage sequences. What Claire's suitors all share is the desire to bring her sexuality under control and tame the "inhuman" woman with her exotic rhythms. It is the engineer, Einar, who will win the contest, and his 'heart machine' plays a key role in the process. First, Einar invents a kind of proto-television device, which allows Claire's concerts to be transmitted instantly anywhere in the world, thus rendering her physical mobility unnecessary. Then, when Claire is subsequently poisoned by another jealous suitor, Einar sets his laboratory into motion—in a final montage sequence unwinding in furious acceleration—and uses his heart machine to reanimate the deceased Claire. As Richard Abel has argued, L'Herbier's audiences would clearly have understood the engineer's machine as a metaphor for the cinema in its capacity to preserve or reanimate life.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  But I would add that this reanimation of the heart's pulse also embodied a fantasy—one once again played out in gendered terms—of subjecting the rhythms of nature to the order of male technology. The engineer Einar not only reanimates Claire's heart, he also controls the threatening rhythms—we see him literally struggling to make it through the montage sequence at the end—embodied in Claire's primitivist soirées with their rapid montage. Receiving an artificial electric heartbeat, Claire thus becomes a metaphor of the cinema's power to impose temporal order over life.  </p>

<p>Coming back to <i>Metropolis</i>, beyond the heart machine itself, what functions to keep the dangerous flow of primal rhythm in check is, of course, precisely Maria's catacomb sermon on the need for a mediating heart, by which she continually diffuses the workers' desire for revolt. But as anyone who has dealt with <i>Metropolis </i>at any 

<b></b>

length knows, this "good Maria" is never far from her wicked double—or to borrow Andreas Huyssen's terms, the virgin is never far from the vamp.<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  It should come as no surprise, then, to see the robot Maria embodying something of a nightmarish double of the orderly "heart machine." Accordingly, at the climactic moment of Rotwang's transformation of the robot, Lang superimposes the image of a pulsing heart onto the robot's chest, whose rhythmical movement sends vital currents soaring through the entire mechanical body. The suggestion here, I think, is that Rotwang has endowed the robot not only with Maria's external appearance, but also—as Huyssen points out—with her sexual life force.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  The image of the pulsing heart follows almost directly upon shots of Rotwang's glass tubes and flasks, which appear to fill with Maria's blood as he effectuates the transformation.</p>

<p>In many ways, Rotwang's experiment also recalls the resuscitation of Claire in <i>L'Inhumaine, </i>and both Rotwang and L'Herbier's engineer could be seen as stand-ins for the filmic artist. But in fact, the "cinema" that Rotwang creates with his construction of the robot is precisely the opposite from that of Einar Norsen. Whereas Einar used technological rhythms to create an obedient machine from an uncontrollable female sexuality, Rotwang's experiment, by infusing the robot with the life-force of organic rhythm, transforms what was a thoroughly obedient machine—Rotwang's <i>Maschinenmensch, </i>which the audience saw following his every command in an earlier scene—into an agent of uncontrollable sexual chaos. In this sense, Rotwang also creates a precise counterpart to the controlling "heart machine" at the center of Fredersen's industrial 

<b></b>

city. And it is hardly a coincidence that the 'false' Maria will lead the flood of raging workers on a rampage to destroy that very same heart machine.</p>

<p>In parallel to this attack, the false Maria also institutes an alternative rhythmical spectacle with her famous erotic dance at Yoshiwara's. In a scene reminiscent of Claire Lescot's sexualized soirées in <i>L'Inhumaine, </i>Maria arrives atop a giant pedestal held up by a circle of nearly-nude black male res bearing primitivist tribal attire [<a href="#6">re 6</a>]. Maria's subsequent Josephine-Baker-style dance—which Lang's editing stages as an ever accelerating rhythmical frenzy—will then send her male audience into convulsions, causing them to lose all self control and attack one another before the stage. In terms of its effects upon its audience, Maria's erotic spectacle recalls the belief, widespread in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, that violent or erotic representations in the cinema could provoke an atavistic regression in spectators. Indeed, Lang specifically constructs Maria's dance as an example of what contemporaries called <i>Schaulust </i>or "visual pleasure," which was understood to reside precisely in the pleasure of atavistic regression before the screen.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  Through editing, close-ups and superimposition, Lang gradually reduces Maria's spectators to a collage of lustful eyes. Through this emphasis on the staring eyes, Lang presents the male audience here not so much as <i>voyeuristic</i>—in the sense of a distanced, controlling gaze—but rather as mesmerized, Maria's rhythmical spectacle causing them to <i>lose </i>all self-control.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This cinema of rhythmic contagion stands diametrically opposed to the good heart machine, and it must, like the rebellious Claire Lescot in <i>L'Inhumaine, </i>be brought 

<b></b>

under control at the end of the film. As Siegfried Kracauer recognized, this exorcism occurs not only through the burning of the bad Maria, but also through the re-ordering of the mass flood into a perfectly geometric mass ornament. The crowd's unified and disciplined movement in the final handshake scene seems to suggest that the "heart machine"—mediating between the body and the intellect, nature and technology, rhythm and <i>Takt</i>—has once again regained its function of imposing order over life's formless flows. Given the complex history of the rhythm debates and the wide range of positions they encompassed, I see no reason to follow Kracauer in interpreting this reimposition of order as a necessary premonition of Nazism.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  I would reiterate, in closing, that it looks back to a certain conception of the cinema: one embodied by L'Herbier's rhythmical heart machine and whose imaginary power consisted in subordinating the rhythms of nature to mechanical order. </p>

Updated December 17, 1996. Bücher's linkage of rhythmical movement and "pleasure," for example, was a commonplace in turn-of-the-century psychology. As one American psychologist described it in an article from 1902: "The great pleasure which children find in rhythm is due to the efficacy of rhythm to set up vibrations in other organs of the body, and the consequent harmonious activity of the several bodily organs. The affective tone increases in proportion as the summation of excitation increases, till a state bordering on ecstasy may be reached" (ibid.) </p>

<p><a name="FOOT44" href="#REF44">44</a>. One could make a similar point for Hans Richter. In the dada circle in Zurich during the war, Richter had developed close contacts with the Laban dance group and—just before making <i>Film ist Rhythmus </i>in 1921—married the Laban dancer and dada artist Sophie Täuber<i>.</i> As we saw above, Richter considered rhythm the essence of emotional expression. Like Eisenstein, he sought to oppose rhythm to any simple metrical determination of frame lengths: "Rhythm," he wrote in one passage, "is not definite, regular succession in time or space, but the unity binding all parts into a whole. [ . . . ] It [ . . . ] is the inner, nature-force [ . . . ], through which we are bound up with the elemental nature-forces" 

<b></b>

(Richter, "Rhythm," 34). Again, this is not to suggest that Richter would have identified with the anti-rational vitalism of Klages and Bode. As Malcolm Turvey has argued, Richter saw his films as an attempt to perform a much more complex balancing act of order and disorder, intentionality and chance, intellect and feeling (see Turvey, "Dada Between Heaven and Hell: Abstraction and Universal Language in the <i>Rhythm</i> films of Hans Richter." <i>October </i>105 : 13–36). Following Standish Lawder, Turvey points to the interplay, in the <i>Rhythm</i> films, between established patterns of regular movement—the parallel and perpendicular movements of white squares over a black background—and the "surprises" and "deviations" that continually interrupt these patterns . To Turvey's analysis, I would only add that Richter largely conceived of such a balancing act as an effort to harness the affective and power of "rhythm" in the service of the (constructivist) intellect. As Richter described it in an article from 1924 entitled "Die schlecht trainierte Seele" ("The Badly Trained Soul"), "Die lebendige Kraft, die wir in dieser [rhythmischen] 'Bewegung' besitzen, [ . . . ] kann [ . . . ] zum Bestandteil menschlicher Macht werden—aber man müßte im Stande sein, diesen Prozeß zu beherrschen, um das Gebiet der Empfindungen ebenso unserem Urteil zugänglich zu machen, wie die anderen menschlichen Willensgebiete, aus deren Entwicklung die 'Seele' bisher ausgeschaltet blieb" (Richter, "Die schlecht trainierte Seele," 28). </p>

<p><a name="FOOT52" href="#REF52">52</a>. Jean Mitry (1904–1988), whose experimental films <i>Pacific 231 </i> and <i>Images pour Debussy </i> Deleuze mentions in the passage cited above, himself played an important role in this history of conceiving filmic aesthetics in terms of rhythm. In his monumental <i>Esthétique et psychologie du cinéma </i>, Mitry devoted an entire chapter to the discussion of filmic rhythm, in which, once again, he differentiated sharply between rhythm and meter. Citing Klages directly, Mitry shares the latter's equation of rhythm and life: "Comme le dit Ludwig Klages, «Le rythme est un phénomène de vie général, auquel participe tout être vivant et aussi l'homme; la mesure est une création humaine; le rythme peut se manifester sous la forme la plus parfaite en l'absence complète de mesure. La mesure par contre ne peut se manifester sans la collaboration d'un rythme»." Jean Mitry, <i>Esthétique et psychologie du cinéma. </i>Paris: Cerf, 2001, 157–158. Precisely because of this distinction, Mitry rejects the analogy of filmic rhythm to musical rhythm (with its regular cadence) maintained by the 1920s proponents of "pure" cinema such as Richter, arguing instead that filmic rhythm is akin to the "free" rhythms of prose poetry. Nonetheless, Mitry retains the association of rhythm with emotion, positing that rhythm serves to lend an affective force to intellectual images, reconnecting them to the realm of dynamic movement and experiential <i>durée</i> (172–176). </p>

<p><a name="FOOT55" href="#REF55">55</a>. The film's highlighting of both the second hand movement and the flashing lights takes up Thea von Harbou's descriptions of clocks in the novel <i>Metropolis, </i>which repeatedly emphasize the 

<b></b>

importance of the <i>second</i>. Toward the beginning of the novel, the narrator describes the giant work clock overlooking the city from atop the New Tower of Babel: "Freders Augen hingen an der Uhr des Neuen Turms Babel, wo die Sekunden als atmende Blitze auffunkten und wegloschen, unaufhaltsam im Kommen wie im Gehen." Thea von Harbou, <i>Metropolis. </i>Frankfurt am Main: Ozeanische Bibliothek, 1984, 19. Moments later, as Freder enters his fathers office, he sees an identical clock on the wall: "Es war die gleiche Uhr, wie sie von der Höhe des Neuen Turms Babel, von Scheinwerfern gebadet, ihre Sekundenfunken über die große Metropolis vespritzte" . In a (highly filmic) description that likely inspired Freder's vision of death in the film, the narrator then describes the second hand as a kind of scythe cutting through Fredersen's head: "Darum stand [Freder] still und blickte unablässig auf den dunklen Schädel seines Vaters und sah, wie der ungeheuere Zeiger der Uhr, unaufhaltsam vorwärtsschreitend, gleich einer Sichel, einer mähenden Sense, wieder hinaufschob an der zahlenumbauschten Rundung, die Höhe überkroch und sich abermals senkte, um den vergeblichen Sensenschlag zu wiederholen" .  </p>

<div class="fn">
<p><a name="FOOT56" href="#REF56">56</a>.

<p><a name="FOOT57" href="#REF57">57</a>. See Theo von Harbou, <i>Metropolis, </i>155: "Es hieß, tief unter der Stadt hin wandere ein Strom. Joh Fredersen hatte ihm den Weg gemauert, als er den Arbeitern von Metropolis die unterirdische Weltwunderstadt erbaute. Es hieß auch, daß der Strom ein gewaltiges Staubecken speise und daß da ein Pumpwerk sei mit neuen Pumpen, die stark genug waren, das Staubecken, in dem eine mittelgroße Stadt Platz hatte, in weniger als zehn Stunden bis auf den Grund zu leeren oder zu füllen. Gewiß war, daß in der unterirdischen Arbeiterstadt das Pochen dieses Pumpwerks als ein leiser, nie unterbrochener Pulsschlag ständig zu hören war, wenn man den Kopf an eine Mauer legte—und daß, wenn dieser Pulsschlag einmal schwieg, kein anderes Deuten möglich war, als daß die Pumpen standen und dann stieg der Strom." The comparison of the heart to a pumping mechanism forms something of a leitmotif in the novel. In a description of Maria being pursued by Rotwang, for example, the narrator states: "Wie ein Pumpwerk hörte sie ihr Herz, immer schneller, immer dröhnender" (ibid., 65). </p>

In an earlier scene in the novel, Rotwang had explained to Maria: "Alle Quellen des Guten sind in mir zugeschüttet. Ich glaubte, sie seien tot; aber sie sind nur Lebendig-Begrabene. Mein Ich ist ein Felsen-Finsternis. Aber ich höre tief in dem traurigen Stein die Quellen rauschen. Wenn ich dem Willen trotze, der über dir und mir ist, wenn ich das Werk zerstöre, das ich nach dir schuf . . . Es geschähe Joh Fredersen recht, und mir wäre wohler!" (ibid., 129). </p>

On the contrary, Bode specifically attacked the re of the "new woman," which he argued represented nothing but a suppression of women's "motherly" calling.

In an article timed to coincide with the release of <i>Metropolis, </i>Lang foreshadowed Maria's sermon in the film when he wrote: "Let us be clear about this. Film is the rhapsody of the twentieth century. But it could be much more for humanity; it could be the traveling preacher who speaks before millions. Through the mute speech of its moving images, in a language that is equally comprehensible in all hemispheres, film can make an honest contribution to repairing the chaos that has prevented nations from seeing each other as they really are ever since the Tower of Babel."

<p>First, a story of extravagance, set in pre revolutionary France. When the nobleman Prince Conti sent a diamond valued at 4 5000 francs to a woman and it was returned to him, he ordered it to be crushed so that he might use it as writing sand to dry the ink of the letter he wrote to her in reply. Taine, who reports this story, comments that "The less one cares about money, the more a man of the world one is." This is a very characteristic story about jewels: it has an aristocrat, gift giving as heterosexual drama, and a double dash of extravagance. It is also unique, for two reasons. First, when Prince Conti used the sand, in order, above all things, to dry the ink on the letter to the woman, he intuited a similarity—even as he emphasized the difference—between the jewel and the text. He hints at an awareness of something shared in the nature of the jewel's, and the letter's, communicativeness. This implication, that the jewel and writing share some kinds of preciousness, renders texts about jewels doubly duplicitous and knowing. Second, the prince's order—to crush the jewel to sand—enacts in one triumphant gesture the trajectory of a paradoxical desire that seems to pervade much modern writing on jewels: the desire to have them disappear. </p>

<p>Another way to put this is to say that the lost or stolen jewel, or, in the Prince's case, the jewel which is <i>not</i>, is by far more interesting than one whose existence is certain. In standard books on jewelry, the liveliest entries are often on those pieces that 

<b></b>

have been lost or stolen; the most alluring of all are on those that remain so. Famous examples, chosen at random, include the blue Brunswick diamond, believed to be in Florida, the yellow Florentine diamond owned by Pope Julius II and the Medici, now lost, and the remaining two bejewelled reliquaries from the medieval Quedlinburg treasure, taken by a U.S. soldier from Europe and offered years later to a hardware store in Wheelwright, Texas, and so mostly recovered in 1992.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  This aesthetics of disappearance is not based only on simple avarice (the suggestion that "It's lost, so I might find it") but further, on a phantom awareness of the sheer anomalous quality of jewels' complete ostentation in a consumer and commodity culture whose masquerades are based on specific economies of display. Jewels, in modernity, are bedeviled by their historical associations, their old-fashioned role as blatant signifiers, displayed upon the royal body, of despotic power. In order to be rendered safe for modernity, jewels, as we shall see, had to be, in turn, exoticized, their circulation policed, and their role reworked from one of public-sphere ostentation to the private sphere task of the mediation of affections. We shall be discerning these successive moves in <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, a Sherlock Holmes story, and a letter of James Joyce to Nora. As the jewel was demoted in status to merely another, if highly valuable, bourgeois <i>bibelot</i>, jewels literally disappeared: they were more seldom worn, more coyly displayed. With their bourgeois-ification, moreover, their status as ultra-valuable useless baubles made them a test case of, and, as we shall see, an affront to the delicate balance of utility and ostentation maintained in the newly valorized version of the object in modernity, the commodity. Jewels, in their extravagance, might have seemed to embody, <i>avant la lettre</i>, all of the qualities to which the commodity might aspire, but their very ostentation was their undoing: the commodity, as it turned out, is related only ambivalently and in complex ways to the celebration of excess. </p>

<p>The jewel might at first glance seem the perfect example of the commodity. Its grossly alluring sparkle serves to make it the ideal example of this near-magical repository of the secret of modern power relations. Indeed, it is one of the very first commodities mentioned in Marx's famous first chapter on "The Commodity" at the opening of <i>Capital</i>: "It is therefore the physical body of the commodity itself, for instance, iron, corn, a diamond, which is the use value or useful thing."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The diamond's ultra-hard, absurdly precious physicality, however, strains Marx's utilitarian notion of "use value" to near breaking point. By the end of the first chapter of <i>Capital</i>, when Marx famously waxes poetic in Section Four, the commodity is described as "a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But Marx's statement, taken in context, gains its power from a paradox: he began by stating that " commodity appears at first sight a very obvious and trivial thing."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The commodity, in other words, derives its effect from infusing with a near-magic power something that was, to begin with, wholly ordinary. Jewels, with histories which resolutely refuse any truck with the ordinary, turn out to be objects from a previous, feudal order of ostentation that are literally too hot to handle for commodity culture. (In the same chapter, some pages earlier, Marx had used as his chief examples of his ideal commodities a linen coat and a wooden table). Given its opulence, the jewel lost status with the advent of mass 

<b></b>

consumerism. Prince Conti's gesture, then, was extravagant, but also prophetic. His making the jewel disappear is repeated, in fact, when the story is retold (and where we found it) in the fullest account of mass consumerism written around the time of that consumerism's inception, Georg Simmel's <i>The Philosophy of Money</i><sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  of 1907. Simmel, unlike Marx, focuses not on the jewel's physicality but on its price—4 5,000 francs. From actual diamonds—now redolent of exoticism, orientalism, femininity, waste and all the "othered" allures considered counter to a rationalizing modernity—to hard cash: such a grinding down of one strange super-commodity into the common denominator of capital is the subject of this essay. </p>

<p>This, then, is an essay about the disappearance of jewels in turn of the century Europe. We take the disappearance of jewels—literally, the way in which ostentatious jewelry-wearing went out of fashion for women in the years between 1890 and 1920—as emblematic of the way in which the ornamental and the detail became nothing less than embarrassing categories in the consumer culture of this period. We will be discerning the complex forces involved in the disappearance of jewels as enacted in three texts: the <i>bibelot</i> scattered Chapter 11 of Oscar Wilde's<i> The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> (1890-1), Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, "The Blue Carbuncle" , and a fascinating letter written by James Joyce to Nora Barnacle in 1909. We want to follow the fortunes of some jewels in texts as a way to interrogate the anomalies of late-Victorian mass consumer culture and the ways in which changes in consumerism have been theorized.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  We might say, taking his story as emblematic, that Prince Conti killed the jewel, but that its ghost lingered on among the wares for sale as a kind of bad conscience. As an object with an aura, with little use value but with vast exchange value, the jewel is a commodity. Unlike many commodities, however, it does not have a planned obsolescence, it can very well manage without a brand name, and it is almost always not mass produced. Its key contradiction as commodity, however, lies in its role as decoration, detail, ornament. As a commodity, that a fabulously valuable jewel should also be a mere ornament simply enhances its reified status, implying a further joke on the ever-more successfully concealed labor time necessary to find, cut and set it. Further, note that the commodity, in Marx's own theory, has the status of the ornament or the detail; he raises his examples of coat and table to the level of a general principle. Why then, at the moment when these commodities, these massed details, were coming to flood the markets of the world, did the ornament itself, with jewels and jewelry as the preeminent kind of personal ornament, lose its status, come to be considered in "bad taste," and begin to disappear? This is the strange development that we will examine in our reading of texts-as-jewelry. </p>

<p>Let us make clear in advance that the stakes of this discussion extend well beyond the matter of the changes of taste in early mass consumerism. At issue, for historians of modernist culture, is this: how did the modernist "excess" evident in so many of the masterworks of "shocking" modernism co-exist with a perhaps equally strong vogue for minimalism in the same period? If the mass of artistic movements generally described under the umbrella-term "modernism" are considered to have produced the representative artworks of the first era of full mass-commodification in the west, and if that 

<b></b>

commodification gloried in an ever-more excessive mass production of consumable goods, then how could it be that minimalism, and the refusal of ornament as tasteless, was also a key impulse in that modernism? In theorizations of modernist cultural production, and in particular of literary production, in the last quarter century, it strikes us that a modernist trajectory that celebrated versions of excess has been emphasized. In this version of modernist aesthetics, the heaping up of detail, to shock, disrupt, engage in carnivalesque gesture or suggest the urban confusion faced by the hapless <i>flâneur</i>, is celebrated as disruptive, subversive, or at least a fertile planting-ground for versions of <i>jouissance</i>-laden supplementarity. The star exhibits of this tendency are, in literature, the post-1914 fiction of James Joyce, in aesthetic theory, the work of Michael Bakhtin, and in art and its manifestos, the work of some surrealists and in particular of George Bataille. We should remember, however, that the modernist minimalist tendency was equally prevalent: here architecture is the signature art form, in which the anti-ornament invective of Loos is complimented by the clean lines and functionalist doctrines of Le Corbusier. Keep in mind that, in the history of twentieth-century aesthetic forms, it was this latter tendency that won out, in the sense that it became the dominant formal tendency in every art form in the post-war era, when the telegraphic phrasings of Beckett replaced Joyce, the silences of John Cage replaced Stravinsky, and the near-blank canvases of Rothko replaced Picasso. Are the seeds of this minimalism everywhere to be discerned in high modernism itself? One might claim that high art became minimalist precisely because of a snobbish desire to repudiate the ornamental excesses of the new mass-produced commodities. We, however, propose that, <i>au contraire</i>, it was precisely in the "minor arts," in that zone where mass commodity production and the design of these minor commodities touched the margins of the zone of exclusivity of the high art forms, that the drive for minimalism began. In the field of commodity design, it might be further argued that these mass commodities came to be "streamlined" merely as a response to the practical considerations of factory mass-production, and that the job of the designers was merely to give the masses a taste for such streamlining. (For example, the Ford Model T, produced on the first full-scale assembly line, had either the aesthetics of nuts and bolts utilitarianism, or it had no "design" at all). Our point, however, is that while both the account of high-art's elitist retreat into minimalism, and the account of how commodities needed to be streamlined for factory production, are true in part, neither exhausts the explanation of the strangest turn of twentieth-century art, its charge to full-scale abstraction, the end-point of the minimalist impulse, in the post-war decades. Both the "elitism" and the "necessity for mass production" explanations become alibis, preventing a more fundamental account of the way in which commodification, and even the modernist carnival based on representing commodity culture, had from the first contained within it the impulse towards its own erasure. How this impulse to erasure manifested itself, and why, is what we will examine here. </p>

<p>That the ornament was under siege even from the pre-modernist moment can be seen from the determination with which <i>fin de siècle</i> and early twentieth century aesthetic theory, and the then-emerging field of theories of design, niggled at the 

<b></b>

ornament as an extremely troublesome category. The most famous of these critics, the Viennese architect and self-promoter Adolf Loos, under the slogan "Ornament is crime," declared in his famous manifesto of 1908<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  that "We have killed the ornament." Likewise, when we speak of the disappearance of jewels in this century, we mean it quite literally. For example, despite exceptions, such as the heavily bejewelled British eccentric poet Edith Sitwell at her poetry readings in the twenties, the fashion for pearl chokers inaugurated by Queen Mary after the First World War, and others, note that if you compare a print of a well dressed upper class woman in evening dress in the 1890s with another from the1920s, the lack of jewelry in the 1920s image (by then it was considered "fussy") will be apparent. This is even more readily discernable in the alterations in women's clothing styles in this period: the enormous crinolines of the 1860s and the bustles of the 1890s were being replaced by 1910,<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  and completely by 1920, with a clear silhouette and a very formalist lack of ornament, as in the dresses of new designers such as Vionnet,<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Poiret, the artist Sonya Delauny, and Coco Chanel. This occurred at precisely the same time as mass consumer culture was becoming the reality in the west. The new consumerism, even at its most expensive reaches, developed a taste for minimalism at the very moment when the new mass commodities, being freed of Victorian ornamentation, were flooding the department stores of the European and American capitals.  </p>

<p>Let us outline a brief history of this disappearance of jewelry in the late nineteenth century. In the 1890s, the tradition of jeweler as refined artisan catering to the rich continued; an ornate statue of the renaissance jeweler and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, for example, was placed on the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, next to the jewelry shops, at the century's end. Stones from India and south Africa were still being added to the British royal regalia at the end of Victoria's reign. Fabergé opened a branch in London in 1906, which lasted until the outbreak of World War I. At the same time, jewelry had began to be factory made: pressed metal pieces often had the precise but heavily wrought appearance most familiar from the Victorian furniture on view at the 1851 London Great Exhibition. By the end of the century, Art Nouveau, or, as it was often called, after the London shop, "Liberty" jewelry, as well as "Arts and Crafts" jewelry, was in vogue.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  This, too, was often of pressed metal, but had flowing lines, enamel coloring rather than heavy ornament, and took its cue from a popularized Ruskinian belief, which he had elaborated in <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i>,<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  in nature—especially J.M.W. Turner's vision of nature—as the basis of all "Good Design." (Loos deplored the Liberty style). At the same time, the prestigious jewelry houses, especially Cartier in Paris and Tiffany in New York, came to cater to the newspaper proprietors and financiers who had organized the new consumerism; in supplying jewelry with upmarket brand names they were the forerunners of the couture houses. Despite their often ostentatious pieces, designed to be seen across the floor of a society ballroom, their influence did not prevent the trend toward simplicity: by the 1910s and certainly by the 1920s, such a rich, highly fashionable woman as the bohemian heiress and writer Nancy Cunard was proud to be photographed bare armed wearing a series of bangles which, despite their appeal to primitivism, look positively formalist, while 

<b></b>

the actress Louise Brooks, dressed perfectly to match the monochromatic possibilities of black and white photography, is most famously seen in a straight black gown set off by a single string of pearls. With this single string of pearls worn as the only jewelry, we might say that formalist abstraction had come to the so called "minor arts," where it had its effect before it reached architecture (the Bauhaus), and on to music (Berg), before it became prevalent in painting (Rodochenko) or in high literature (Beckett). </p>

Jewels in Theory: Design Theory, <i>Capital</i> and Expenditure

<p>It is an interesting game to trace congruences of styles and sensibilities in high literature and jewelry in the late Victorian and modernist eras: the heavy, polished periods of the later Trollope, for example, have something in common with Victorian pendants; we could speak of Thomas Hardy's "Arts and Crafts" style, and, remembering the favorite new material from which some of Nancy Cunard's bangles were probably made, we might think of the early Evelyn Waugh's bakelite prose. The joke here, if there is one, is about the difference between high literature and low commodities that would like to have a high style. This yearning of the commodity and its designers for access to such "high style" is what underlies and renders anxious nineteenth century discussions of design, from John Ruskin to Adolf Loos. Out of this anxious discourse, we suggest, minimalism came to be fashionable not so much because of high art's anxiety to distance itself from the low-brow love of detail, but because of the anxiety of the designers of mass-produced commodities to be seen to be original, and not just tasteless imitators of the products of the rich. Commodities, as mass reproductions of originals whose style was up to that point accessible only to an elite, were burdened in much design theory with the charge of snobbery. This charge was most often made by the designers themselves, members of the new profession that was growing up to decide the appearance of these very commodities. Itself oppressed by anxiety about its own legitimacy, design theory, as we will show, seemed unable to ignore the ornament as its basic working category, but it also seized on the ornament, the detail, as the very element which it must give up, or get beyond, as the price to be paid so that design could be taken seriously. In the process it brought into play the terms of a discussion in aesthetics on the role of the detail versus the whole, a discussion older than St. Augustine, into a barely covert exploration of how the potential relations between elite art and popular forms in the dawning era of the mass-commodity could be staged upon the commodity itself. </p>

<p>In this exploration of how "style" matters in design, design theory, a discursive field then only beginning to tentatively emerge as a sub-discourse of aesthetics and the appreciation of art, could never be disinterested. Itself the field being developed to show off the new commodities and make them sell, one of its aims, despite its rhetoric, was to sate the consumer's desire for prestige.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  To hide its ambivalence, we suggest, design writing elaborated a series of novel twists in the rhetoric of "taste." Ornamentation came to be condemned as a naive imitation of highbrow forms; "vulgarity," carefully delineated as either an over-ostentatious aping of one's betters rather than simply a 

<b></b>

down-market wallowing in the popular, was nominated as the proclivity which consumers should most fear; and the possibility of being vulgar was set up as a delicious sin that might easily be committed by the most outrageous purchase. In this complex and delicately nuanced structure of feeling, one that is carefully modulated to cater to the neophyte consumer, the jewel could be especially dangerous. Clearly, as an ornament, it was suspect. More, as an object whose previous provenance was chiefly aristocratic, this ornament in its new incarnation couldn't help but be a knock-off of a more high brow form. Vulgarity, then, shimmered very close to the surface of even the most expensive Cartier jewels. Yet this fear of vulgarity, defined most vehemently as a naive imitating of one's betters, which became the <i>bête noire</i> of the new design rhetoric,<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  found, in the case of jewels, its counterpoint of a new critique of the ornamental and the jewel as vulgar in the simpler, older sense because it was "other" as well. The material for this argument came not from the register of class but rather, from the imperialist and jingoist discourses of race and gender. For jewelry partook of body ornament, especially among the so called "primitive" peoples, and the bodies being ornamented were very often those of women. Thus the language of "vulgarity" as naive imitation and thus as a class solecism in design theory gets flanked by invocations of vulgarity as it was felt to be evidenced on the bodies of colonial native peoples and women.  </p>

<p>As with so many late-Victorian discourses, even ones so ostensibly attentive to the protocols and tastes defining western identities as was design theory, an undercurrent of colonial loathing could be called upon in any argument to illustrate what the reader must avoid. The casting of the ornament in terms of the fear of colonial influence had already been evident in the work of John Ruskin, who rendered the detail as the essential aesthetic category, since his love of Gothic architecture was built upon a belief in the value of the finely crafted detail. Ruskin could delight in the notion that his beloved and highly detailed gargoyles were "savage," but he received a severe jolt, as E.H. Gombrich<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  puts it, from the Indian mutiny of 1857. Afterwards, he decided that there was a perverse refusal to imitate nature in Indian art, which, he claimed, instead followed geometric patterns. Ruskin, nevertheless, could valorize the savage's presumed <i>natural </i>aptitude as a designer. This was repeated by Owen Jones in his important <i>The Grammar of Ornament</i><sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  of 1861, when, for example, he described a tattooed head from New Zealand, which he found in a museum in Chester, as "being the result of a natural instinct, necessarily always true to its purpose." He went on: "In much of the ornament of civilized nations, the first impulse which generated received forms . . . [was] enfeebled by constant repetition." It was however Adolf Loos who, in 1908, expressed unabashedly the assumptions about "civilization" that made possible Ruskin's and Jones's faint praise: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The less civilized a people is, the more prodigal it will be with ornament and decoration. The Red Indian covers every object, every boat, every oar, over and over with ornament. To regard decoration as an advantage is tantamount to remaining on the level of the Red Indian. But the Red Indian within us must be overcome. He says: That woman is beautiful because she wears golden rings in her nose and ears. The civilized person says: this woman is beautiful because she has no rings in her nose and ears. To seek beauty only in 

<b></b>

form and not to make it depend on ornament, that is the aim towards which the whole of mankind is tending.</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">With Loos, a horror of vulgarity, as in the consumer's desire to cross class lines all too easily with commodities, is bolstered by his attribution of vulgarity to natives, to women, and by implication to human bodies in general. Here, at the high point of the proto-modernist attack on ornament, we find natives, women and the body invoked—and note that the most ornamental of ornaments for Loos are pieces of jewelry, rings (if for the nose and face, rather than the finger).  </p>

<p>To sketch this single thread in the varied late Victorian discourse of design is to show how anxiously the new design writers policed the role of the detail. For the design writers, in their conceptions of the emerging affective and social structures of commodity culture, the detail was crucial, yet endlessly worrisome. We will now read Marx through Ruskin, Jones and Loos, to show how in <i>Capital </i>also the detail is the central, and yet the impossible, category. To read Marx along with these early design theorists is to discern an uncanny parallel sense of the relation of the detail to versions of totality. While the design writers bolstered their narratives of the vulgarity of the ornament in class terms in the west with colonist and misogynist assumptions about civility, the colonial natives' sense of ornament was praised by these writers, nevertheless, as long as it was "organic"—that is, when they could credibly imagine it as an inevitable part of, and a representative component of, a specific culture. When we turn to Marx's theory of the commodity, we discern here also the insistent trace of the ornament, the detail, again imagined as a feature of "primitive" cultures. Consider Marx's invocation of the fetish, which might, as Marx uses it, be defined as the ornament which some primitive people were naive enough to deify. It is the term that Marx took over from texts like Charles de Brosse's <i>Of the Cult of the Fetish Gods</i> of 1760.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Of course it is not only design theorists and the original Marxist who deployed imperialist terms to condemn enemies at home: Marx, however, goes further here to echo the impulses of the designers. By making an implicitly imperialist investigation of the fetishised commodity the basis of his whole theory of the workings of the system of capital, he too took the detail as the essential emblem of the larger culture. His valorization of "use value" of the commodity detail parallels the designer's interest in form following function. His narrative of "exchange value," as the needless excess imposed upon the commodity by capital, is akin to their attack on unnecessary ornament. His commodity fetish, however, has the last laugh in <i>always </i>lulling the consumer, rather than merely having the potential to embarrass her socially. While the outrageous ornamentation of the designer's <i>bibelots</i> merely whips up clouds of insecurity around the consumer's desire, the Marxian fetishised commodity effects nothing less than a reification of all social relations. Most strikingly, however, Loos's decree of the end of ornament in favor of "good design" is paralleled by Marx's gesture, having seized the commodity from its ornamental and detailed obscurity, in then refusing to differentiate it. That is, for Marx, every commodity is merely a commodity, and all are subsumed under the mechanics of capital.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>This refusal to differentiate between all the details he has brought into theoretical view, in turn, leads Marx to a narrative which tells us that human subjects interact with them always and invariably in the same way. This may be summed up, in Jennifer Wicke's terms, as a practice "inherently partaking of the alienation or reification thought to haunt the commodity in its fetishised, indeed its only, form."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The commodity's pervasiveness means the reification of human relations, whereby the relations between people are mediated, so that they are replaced by a relation to things. What we have, then, is the disappearance, in the theory, of a sense of the particularity of the commodity, so that the object—whether it be a bar of lemon scented soap, as in Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>,<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  or the Brunswick diamond—is all pervasive but strangely intangible. It is everywhere, but it matters only as much as any other commodity. This means, in Marx's theoretical framework, that its effect is always and invariably the same. Consuming is pictured as a standardized, repetitive exercise where a fool is victimized. The theorists of design, then, may have advocated the sort of "taste" that was responsible for the disappearance of ostentatious jewelry as the body decoration of women in the west at the turn of the century; Marx's theory of the commodity, which might seem to help us theorize this disappearance, would, rather, have us ignore it as itself too much of an historical detail. Further, Marx's theory's refusal, in the final instance, of the relevance of details, denies not only the particularity of any given commodity, but also the potential effectiveness of any specific kind of subjective agency in relation to it. </p>

<p>If Marx's commodity theory, therefore, shuns the detailed commodity that it began by invoking just as surely as the design theorists denied the ornament which they began by sensing might be the ground of their work, then deviations from the totalizing Marxian paradigm need to be assessed with reference to the history of such agency and its effects. The work of turn of the century sociologists comes to mind here, particularly that of Thorsten Veblen, whose differentiation of modes of consumption, as in conspicuous consumption, where the customer buys ostentatiously in order to display his wealth, and vicarious consumption, where the buyer, usually male, buys to display his wealth upon another, usually female,<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  are key concepts for distinguishing different modes of the masquerade like social behavior that is characteristic of reified consumer culture. They are also, as one might imagine, highly useful in describing how luxury ornaments like jewels lend themselves to extraordinary exaggerations of what are everyday consumer practices. (And here one might refer to Quentin Bell's—Virginia Woolf's nephew—witty exposition of Veblen, in his book<i> On Human Finery</i><sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> )<i>. </i>Veblen's categories, useful as they are in describing degrees of behavior, are however still recuperable within Marx's paradigm of a standard act of consumption. To offer a taxonomy of consumer behaviors is, it turns out, merely a strategy to validate the monotonous sameness of every consumer's trip to the payment point. Apparently deviant protocols of consumption may, for their practitioner, be ostentatious rites on the path to status, but to the social critic they are merely signs, to be read ironically, of a foolhardy appeal to a variety which is in fact unattainable. Such variety is unattainable precisely because, despite their varied appearances, in the final instance all commodities are similarly structured. Every commodity is similar because each commodity is a miniature 

<b></b>

version of the social structure of consumer culture in its totality. To this monotonous sameness, the jewel, even as super-commodity and as extraordinarily significant minor detail, as merely ornamental ornament, posed a threat. </p>

<p>Both Marx's critique and the doctrines of the early designers placed the commodity and the ornament respectively in a paradoxical double bind. The commodity for Marx may have been mystical, but it has congealed within it a story of despair (of the exploited workers who produced it, and of the relations between humans it will replace, as it reifies). Similarly, for the design theorists, the ornamental detail contains within it the embarrassing story of the vulgar <i>parvenu</i> aspirations of the bourgeois consumer to ape her betters. Just as Marx, faced with this bad commodity, turned with relief to "use value" as the only acceptable honesty in things, so the designers turned to utility as a value for objects. From the first, however, "use value" was for Marx a kind of mirage, as he implicitly allows in the second footnote in <i>Capital</i>, where he is forced to admit that "desire implies want" , that is, that "use" in the attribution of what John Locke had termed "worth" in an object must invariably open itself to the widest interpretation. Similarly, "functionality" as benchmark in design theory is also an inadequate kind of moralism: the undecorated, "streamlined" commodity does not need to possess any necessary connection to function whatsoever. (This notion of function led in part to the cult of the machine—and ambivalence about the body—in modernism, and to such pronouncements as Le Corbusier's that "The house is a machine for living in"). At the same time, while "use value" and "function" were proving to be shifting grounds on which to base the real worth of, respectively, the commodity and the ornamental detail, the visions of excess discernable in these mere things was being castigated as well. Marxism saw the quality of "exchange value" as socially dangerous in the most fundamental ("fetishistic") sense; design theory likewise read ornamentality and signs of exuberance as a social solecism. The commodity, whether critiqued by social commentators or policed by its own designers, was thus trapped in a double bind. The puritanism of the Protestant work ethic had permeated not just capitalism but capitalism's most characteristic production, the commodity. Mass consumer commodity culture, far from ushering in an outrageousness in the commodity form, rather, inaugurated a commodity modesty, a new aesthetic of plainness. The Victorian fashion for ornate jewelry was, in this development, one of the first casualties. Ornate jewelry's disappearance was an early symptom of a minimalism which would be brought to bear on all commodities and to which, within forty years, the highest arts would all conform.  </p>

<p>In the period when an old form came to be seen as too ostentatious and disappear, therefore, did literary representations of jewels take on a new valence? As we now come to read the texts on jewels, rather than speculate on the disappearance of the ornaments themselves—that is, on why ornament went out of style—we will argue that jewels, having been, through the design theorist's education in tasteful, sophisticated consumerism, shamefully hidden as the worst kind of ornament, were now free and dangerous signifiers. Their very invocation in a text, therefore—an invocation that struck out against the prevailing taste to keep them hidden—could be a coded reference to any number of strands in the political unconscious of the culture in which it 

<b></b>

appeared. Because the jewel, however, as decoration and "useless" detail was also so manifestly a part of that consumer culture, these representations of jewels worked to explore how the problems that they were made to represent played out in the new consumerism, and perhaps covertly to enlarge the range of effects open to the subject as agent in such a culture. Before turning to the texts, we want briefly to sketch the key theoretical exploration of how such ostentation could in fact break through the inexorable objectivity of commodification—George Bataille's notion of expenditure—as well as the most important topos that relates such commodification to other theorized modes of subjective agency, work related to the multiple valences of the concept of fetishism itself. As we will show, Wilde's <i>Dorian Gray </i>flaunts jewels as the taunt of expenditure, while the Sherlock Holmes story waylays the jewel in much the same way as the psychoanalyst hunts down the fetish. Finally we will locate in Joyce's letter the signs of a meticulous consumerism that is bedeviled both by a madness for expenditure and an almost neurotic sense that this gesture must be self-monitored, overseen, and, exactly through turning it into a careful and detailed textuality, controlled. </p>

<p>Bataille works to elude the trap posed by Marx's notion of "use value." He describes two modes of expenditure: that minimum necessary to maintain life, and "unproductive expenditure," which is "contrary to the economic principle of balanced accounts." His examples include cults of sacrifice, competitive games, luxury fashions, and literature. His first example, however, is the jewel. His famous paragraph on the jewel is worth quoting in full:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Jewels must not only be beautiful and dazzling (which would make the substitution of imitations possible): one sacrifices a fortune, preferring a diamond necklace; such a sacrifice is necessary for the constitution of the necklace's fascinating character. This fact must be seen in relation to the symbolic value of jewels, universal in psychoanalysis. When in a dream a diamond signifies excrement it is not only a question of association by contrast: in the unconscious, jewels, like excrement, are cursed matter that flows from a wound: they are a part of oneself destined for open sacrifice (they serve, in fact, as sumptuous gifts charged with sexual love). The functional character of jewels requires their immense material value and alone explains the inconsequence of the most beautiful imitations, which are very nearly useless.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In this fantastic theoretical depth charge, what occurs is that jewels are associated, as in Owen Jones, with the savage, or what Bataille earlier called "disarmingly savage needs," but since psychoanalysis in this quote guarantees the universality of these needs, no recourse is needed to the Darwinian dogmas of the designers. Instead, a full frontal attack upon what Bataille terms "classical utility" as the bulwark of circulation in capitalism can be attempted with the unlikely weapon of the jewel. Less evident, however, is the effect of this ostentatious loss (of the spent fortune, in the quote above) as a form of radical cultural attack. What, beyond the gesture, does this excess expenditure achieve? The list of examples given by Bataille, which begins with the jewel, ends with literature and an inconclusive excursus on poetry as the poet's "use of words only for his own loss." If great poetry is like expensive jewelry, can either erupt from 

<b></b>

the flat mediocrity of standardized consumption and reification in a carnival igniting visions of some utopian alternative? Bataille, for whom poetry is the "use of word's for . . . [the poet's] own loss," seem inconclusive on this score; his phrase might however well serve as an epigram for what we shall see in a moment enacted by Dorian Gray's interest in jewelry. </p>

<p>The detail's potential to erupt as a trace of supplementarity has been most studied in work on the multiple valences of the term "fetishism"; the paradox, however, seems to be that to involve fetishism is also to begin to police it, and the effect of policing fetishism is possibly the opposite to the effect of Bataille's "criminal" expenditure. Fetishism is the rubric under which a discussion of the telling detail opens into psychoanalysis; it is also the rubric under which a link between the structure of Marx's version of the detail—the commodity—and Freud's symptom can be drawn. Yet Emily Apter, in her influential <i>Feminizing the Fetish,</i><sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  confesses that she cannot construct a paradigm broad enough to discuss the commodity fetish and the fetish as it is discussed in Freud. Note that the psychoanalyst's hunt for the fetish, as an expression of the masculine fear of the telling detail to which the patient is "too" attracted, so that the desired fetish must be revealed as a perverse simulacrum of a (merely hypothesized) phallic presence, is a running to ground of the "perverse" detail that is paralleled by the search and recovery mission engaged in by that other turn-of-the-century searcher for clues and criminals, Sherlock Holmes. (Freud's phallogocentric version of the fetish no doubt does go some way to explaining how, in the detective story, we can be presented with the spectacle of bourgeois men taking a keen interest in jewels). Just as the psychoanalyst, in order to police sexuality, invokes in the fetish the spectacle of the "bad detail," so the detective, in his policing of the bad consumer (the criminal who steals rather than buys) is no doubt similarly inclined towards ambivalence about the stolen commodity. Here, this commodity is the "Blue Carbuncle" of the story we will consider. </p>

<p>And so from jewels themselves to texts about jewels. In Dorian Gray's study of jewels, described in the eleventh chapter of Oscar Wilde's novel <i>The Portrait of Dorian Gray</i>,<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  we have a version of Bataille's expenditure <i>avant la lettre</i>. Here, the hero's ostentation and fascination pretends to be merely a form of ostentatious prestige-flaunting and conspicuous consumption in Veblen's terms, but is really engaged (as the novel's trajectory implies) in the lavish expenditure of one who wishes to utterly undermine bourgeois utility: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and fifty pearls. This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said to have never left him. He would often spend a whole day setting and resetting in their cases the various stones he had collected, such as the olive green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wire like line of silver, the pistachio coloured peridot, rose pink and 

<b></b>

wine yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremendous four rayed stars, flame red cinnamon stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternative layers of ruby and sapphire.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> </p>

<p class="continued">This was written in the period when the <i>nouveau riche</i> wives of U.S. and European millionaires were launching a fashion for large ostentatious jewels, the kind that would show to advantage on the staircase of a hotel ballroom, and purchased from the up market jewelry houses of Tiffany, Fouquet, Boucheron, Mellerio, Chaumet and Cartier: the famous collection of stage jewelry made by Lalique between 1895 and 1912 for Sarah Bernhardt is a good example. Wilde's text on the face of it appears to endorse this ostentation on purely aesthetic grounds. Still, the deeply etched sensuousness of his appreciation for those amethysts and opals, even if, as it appears, it was copied from the South Kensington Museum Art Handbook, rings as a swansong for decorative ornament in the highbrow field of vision. When these descriptions are followed by pages of stories about jewels—of Richard II's coat covered with ballas rubies, of the King of Malabar's Venetian rosary of three hundred and four pearls (one for every god that he worshiped) (p. 136-7), the fear of the design theorists that the new ornament would merely vulgarly imitate the old is short circuited, for Dorian takes refuge in antiquarianism ("Even to read of the luxury of the dead is wonderful," he gushed) (p. 137). </p>

<p>Dorian is the ideal jewel wearer. As aesthete, he possesses the merits of the eighteenth century virtuoso, the antiquarian as collector of freakish details. He adds to this the finesse of the new connoisseur who won respect as the careful appraiser of the value of the telling detail. As a male who dons his pearls to dress as Anne de Joyeuse, he takes to his logical conclusion Veblen's "vicarious consumption," by which the rich entrepreneur, himself dressed plainly, displays his wealth upon the body of his spouse. Yet when we consider the game of concealment and suggestion that Wilde is playing in <i>not quite</i> representing his homosexuality in this novel, however, we realize that what might have been read by the idealist reader as his grand frenzy of Bataillean expenditure, probably appeared, in the eyes of the knowing Victorian observer, as the "antics" of one whose sexual identity the court system would soon after describe as perverse. As such, it is as if Dorian, as Wilde's vehicle, discovers in this chapter that ostentation is always relative, and that it is tough to be ostentatious—especially ostentatious to the point of political action—in a well heeled and bejewelled consumer culture of glittering commodities. The poet, said Bataille, "can use words only for his own loss," and as Dorian desperately pursues the opulence of the decorated self in a series of media in the rest of the chapter—he tries perfumes, embroideries, and (most enjoyably) ecclesiastical vestments—we see the implosion of the hero as agent as he, too, under the inexorable machinery delineated by Marx, allows his relationships to be mediated by fetishised commodities.  </p>

<p>This chapter from Wilde, of the three texts examined here, is the most self evident; this is not simply because it is the most luxuriously sensuous, but, further, that every reader empathizes with Dorian, for the impulse to expend is, after all, the most heavily 

<b></b>

and insistently taught to us as denizens of consumer society. It is a pity, however, from the point of view of a political reading—consider the sexual politics here—if what might have been the avowal of sexual difference can be read by many readers as a simple advertisement for the jewelry counters at the—in the 1890s—newly opened department stores or for the windows of Cartier or Boucheron. </p>

<p>Wilde's livid sensuousness gives way, only one year later, to the drab 1891 Sherlock Holmes story, where the most graphic description of the jewel occurs in the title, "The Blue Carbuncle,"<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  and in a phrase from the story as follows: "See how it glints and sparkles." In the detective story, in which a robbery is solved, we are granted pleasure in the surveillance of bad consumerism; here, men as guardians of smooth consumption are allowed not to be interested in jewels as such, but only in their circulation. They are allowed to be interested in them only when the jewels have disappeared. While the jewel is at the very heart of the narrative economy of the story, its entire <i>raison d'être </i>and its fetish, it is all the same curiously dematerialized; like the fetish cigar that is not really a cigar, it is a jewel that is not really a jewel, but merely a substitute signifier of commodity, in this case a substitute for the wealth of the aristocracy. "The Blue Carbuncle" stages a surveillance around this absent jewel as a contrast between different class registers of consumption in mass culture; it enacts the management of the place of the fetish jewel in modern culture, and thus reassures its mass readership that a less luxurious commodification is the ideal one. In other words, it strongly reinforces the old class self consciousness of the design theorists upon the surface of the jewel. </p>

<p>It is appropriate, then, that this is a Christmas story, the moment when the new consumers, Bataille's detested bourgeoisie, could engage in a minor potlatch, gift giving that lightly went against the grain of capitalist utilitarianism under the cover of the delirium of consumption. In the story, Holmes is brought the jewel by a policeman; the policeman had stopped an assault on a man carrying a Christmas goose, and had ended up by mistake with the fowl. The policeman's wife, preparing it for the holiday meal, had found the diamond in its crop. Holmes traces the diamond, <i>via</i> a Covent Garden fowl stall, to a small supplier; it turns out that this woman's brother, a hotel porter who had stolen the diamond, had slipped it down the throat of the goose which was to be his Christmas present; his sister had then given him another fowl. Clearly, as Holmes traces the path of the jewel, which itself follows the fortunes of a Christmas goose, the joke here is the strangeness of the stone's new context: it is a joke of surrealist juxtaposition designed to shock. This is a tale of a disappeared jewel: it disappeared into the craw of another commodity—the Christmas goose. What does the comic shock of this association effect? Juxtaposed are the ostentatious ornaments of an old order—of the duchess of Morcar, who stays at the anonymous Hotel Cosmopolitan, who is never seen in the text, so that she is dematerialized like her jewel, and the approved gift of the new—the goose, which metonymizes home, hearth, warmth and family of the blessings, and sated appetites, of a flexible middle class consumerism.  </p>

<p>Predictably, then, Sherlock Holmes in fact literalizes the claims Adolf Loos would make some years later, that "ornament is crime": in a conversation with Watson he attributes the stone's glitter to the fact that, as he puts it, "Of course it is the center and 

<b></b>

focus of crime. Every facet represents a bloody deed." As he enumerates these crimes, what occurs is that the conventional yoking of the jewel and adventure, by which the jewel for the adventurer male is fetishised as the "treasure" he desires or lacks, is made evident only to be neutralized by Holmes, whose rationality has now put an end to the circle of violence which was for him the only element that made the stone interesting in the first place. What we have in the story, then, is a drama of the successful recontainment of the fetish object—an object that would have been lost among the offal of London if the policeman family man had not had a keen, and domestic, wife, and which Holmes snatches only to reconsign it to the rightful oblivion of the anonymous hotel. Meanwhile, homesites of more staid and less ostentatious wealth and consumption, where families prepare geese for Christmas feasts, are valorized. </p>

<p>The disappearance of the jewel in the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century west is then itself a complicated phenomenon, a blueprint, perhaps, for a relatively new phenomenon of mass consumption, what it means to "go out of style." First, there was an attack on the detail and the ornament as a degraded symptom of commodity culture's guilty desires. The jewel stood too blatantly for the ambitions of the consuming masses to rise socially, but when employed, as in <i>Dorian Gray</i>, to imagine gratuitously excessive and transgressive expenditure, it was discovered that such ostentation, despite the theorist's attacks, is the driving impulse, the secret engine, of all consumer behavior. On the other hand, as we have just sketched, dramas of bourgeois surveillance in aid of smooth running consumerism had to invoke fetishes of the commodity like the jewel in order to re-contain them—in the Holmes story, in effect, what is being preached is that a humbler consumerism (of geese rather than diamonds) is ideal, or at least preferable, in order to forestall the mass alienation that Marx decided would result from mass consumerism. (Such alienation in the story seems only to effect the lost duchess in her lonely hotel room). Nevertheless, the jewel still has to be invoked in order to preach all this. The new-century handler of these culturally suspect jewels, then, was being educated, on the one hand, to strike the note of a degree of ostentation that was not blatant enough to engender anxiety, and, on the other, to re commodities like jewels within the space of the family and the intimate. This rered "taste" would in effect trade public ostentation for the more homely dream implied in what Bataille called these "sumptuous gifts charged with sexual love." Under capitalism, consumerism would be policed like every other behavior, and protocols for this behavior had to be developed. The first was that consumption would be domestic in scale. What it means to exchange gifts charged with sexual love in the era of consumerism is what is negotiated in the letter by James Joyce that will be our final exhibit. </p>

<p>By 1909 James Joyce and Nora Barnacle had been living together for five years in Pola, Rome and Trieste; in that year Joyce made his first return visit to Ireland while Nora remained behind. It was the first time they had been separated, and they exchanged a series of passionate letters. One of these, perhaps the most measured, has a meticulous account of some jewelry. It reads as follows:

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>3 Sept. 1909	24 Fontenoy St. Dublin</p>
<p>My true love. Your present is lying before me on the table as I write, ready. I will now describe it to you. It is a fat square case of brown leather with two narrow golden borders. When you press a spring it opens and the case itself inside is cushioned with soft orange coloured silk. A small square card lies in the case and in the card there is written in gold ink the name Nora and under that the dates 1904 1909. Under the card is the ornament itself. There are five little cubes like dice (one for each of the five years we have been away) made of yellowish ivory which is more than a hundred years old. These are drilled through and strung together on a thin gold fetter chain the links of which are like small safety pins so that the whole string forms a necklet, and the clasp is at the back beside the middle dice. In the center of the chain in front and forming part of the chain itself (<i>not</i> hanging from it like a pendant) there is a small tablet also of yellowish ivory which is drilled through like the dice and is about the size of a small domino piece. This tablet has on both sides an inscription and the letters are engraved into it. The letters themselves are selected from an old book of types and are in the fourteenth century style and are very beautiful and ornamental. There are three words engraved on the face of the tablet, two above and two underneath, and on the reverse of the tablet there are four words engraved, two above and two below. The inscription (when both sides are read) is the last line of one of the early songs in my book of verses, one which has also been set to music: and the line is therefore engraved three words on the face and four on the back. On the face the words are <i>Love is unhappy </i>and the words on the back are <i>when love is away</i>. The five dice mean the five years of trial and misunderstanding and the tablet which unites the chain tells of the strange sadness we felt and our suffering when we were divided.</p>
<p>This is my present, Nora. I thought over it a long time and saw every part of it done to my liking. Save me, my true love. Save me from the badness of the world and my own heart.</p>

<p>Here, then, we return to the love-letter writing of Prince Conti with which we began: another love-letter, another jewel. Now, however, writing about jewels and the jewels themselves are interchangeable, not alternatives. If you follow Joyce's description, you will see that this piece of jewelry is certainly not ostentatious—rather, the ostentation is in the meticulousness of the written description, as well as in the extraordinary care that was taken in planning and overseeing the making of the jewel. It seems, too, that what matters most about the jewel is the engraved line of poetry written upon it. We can see here the influence of Arts-and Crafts movement romanticism, an attempt to avoid the alienation of direct consumption by the effort of personal attention that infuses the object's form with an allegorical meaning. Remember that the Celtic Revival in Ireland at this time was in very large part, especially as it applied to the "minor arts," an Arts and Crafts phenomenon. The arts and crafts sensibility of the revival extended not only, through Yeats, to its famous writers, but also in its own craft revivals, as for example with Yeats's own sisters at the Cuala Press.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  That Joyce did not plan Celtic motifs for his necklace may be seen as part of his determined internationalism; even the script is not in the then very fashionable Celtic scrollwork. At the same time, the necklace was an act of profligate expenditure—in the very same weeks Joyce was begging his brother, also in Trieste, to wire him money—so that the ornament also possesses an (unspoken) 

<b></b>

status as a bright consumer item because of its enormous cost (to the purchaser). Thus only public ostentation in the necklace is elided or minimized, and its intimate significance for the two lovers is magnified. This is a minimalist jewel—Veblen's "vicarious consumption" is not really at work here—because it attempts a dream of disengagement from the cycle of consumer capital altogether, based on an exacting craftsman ethic in the service of the kind of heterosexual bliss of which Holmes (despite his own bachelorhood) was eager to claim he approved. </p>

<p>Now this is of course not an uncommon dream; indeed it is the most prevalent scenario regarding affect at which the commodity has always pitched its pleasures. What is surprising is that Joyce, above all people, should be its mouthpiece. However, Joyce's turn to familial consumerism is inevitably more complex than it appears. For this letter is the most staid of the series written during the separation between the two lovers—in these weeks they wrote to each other the magnificently intimate, "pornographic" letters that Richard Ellmann eventually published belatedly, and which caused their own minor Joycean scandal. We are not going to attempt to analyze these letters—moving as they undoubtedly are—except to point out that, coming in the midst of them, this preoccupation with a very specific piece of jewelry as a gift seems to fetishistically draw into itself the sexual energy generated in the other texts. Sexual desire, in Joyce's part of the correspondence, is constructed as a typical struggle between idealistic love and guiltily held appetites: the piece of jewelry, like the frilly underwear and the furs that get mentioned in the other letters, occupies a role as a bearer of shifting symbolism between these two structures of feeling. We are not claiming that the necklace is a fetish in psychoanalytic terms, simply that it does function, like the fetish, to allow its inventor to continue the practice of an avowedly fallen sexuality. If this strategy prevents a full scale consumerist alienation, then it was worth the artifice. </p>

<p>A final point: although this letter and its jewel-textuality, is obviously not a literary text, in a sense it may be said to have given rise to one. This trip of Joyce's, Ellmann makes clear, is a source for a vast number of the settings for <i>Ulysses</i>; it was the occasion when he visited his friend Byrne in seven Eccles St., and when he told Oliver St. John Gogarty, Buck Mulligan in <i>Ulysses, </i>that he would write about him, for example. (Joyce dates the beginning of the novel to 1914; the letter was written in 1909). The correspondence with Nora itself articulates a whole discourse of sexuality that came to pervade <i>Ulysses</i>. The novel, in other words, can be said to have come to be imagined out of that Dublin trip; the erotic correspondence provides the necessary tissue of text for imagining the whole erotic economy of the novel at that very moment; the necklace, and its letter, provides the necessary punctum for that correspondence. If the discoveries of the trip and the spirit of the letters infuse themselves into <i>Ulysses</i>, then the necklace that is to be found strangely at the heart of the Joyce Nora correspondence on that occasion may be said to lie secreted at the heart of<i> Ulysses</i> itself. In the book itself there are very few jewels, however: Molly thinks once of an old Claddagh ring,<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  and of a ring she gave to her soldier lover Mulvey, who was going off to the Boer War where he was killed; earlier, Stephen had remembered his dead mother's "gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer" (p.8), and in the "Wandering Rocks" episode of 

<b></b>

the novel he watches a jeweler in his dusty shop: "Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones" (p. 198). (The intonation of Stephen's thought whenever he dwells on jewels suggests that the hero of <i>Portrait</i> had been a careful reader of Wilde's <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray). </i>However, if the jewels as such have largely disappeared, as they did in modernist high culture generally, their effect is manifested in the vast crowds of details, the constant use of ornament, that fills out the novel. The kind of alienation that the necklace warded off would soon be well couched in minimalist, anti ornamental prose: think of Joyce's own disciple, Samuel Beckett. The jewels themselves disappear in the spectacles created by prose like that of Joyce, but they hang on in a ghostly existence. Quentin Bell, in his study <i>On Human Finery</i>, has a final, intriguing appendix on "The Dress of Ghosts:"—it turns out that it is a dress without any detail. But the ghostly presence of the disappeared jewel in one loquacious strand of twentieth century modernism, that of Joyce, is evidenced rather in the constant reiteration of details and ornaments in order to try to drum the recalcitrant commodity out of its interminable cycles and into a moment of telling that might at last reveal its other, wilder, uses and effects. </p>

<p id="lead">Very little has been published on John Dos Passos's frequent travels to Mexico in the late 1920s and early 1930s. These trips are mentioned in passing by his biographers, but so far no critics have tried to find out more details about what Dos Passos might have done during his journeys south of the border: did he meet any Mexican writers or artists? Did his works find a readership among local intellectuals? Did he have contact with any of the numerous foreign intellectuals who had made Mexico their temporary home? The latter is an especially important question, given that during the 1920s and 1930s Mexico had become a cultural magnet, drawing illustrious visitors from almost every corner of the world: Arthur Cravan, Tina Modotti, Edward Weston, D.H. Lawrence, André Breton, Antonin Artaud, Sergei Eisenstein, and Leon Trotsky all spent time in Mexico during this period, and certainly Dos Passos must have crossed paths with at least some of them. So whom did he meet? Whom did he read? What did he think of the heated debates about art and national identity that dominated the intellectual scene after the end of the Revolution? Did he find a kindred soul in any of the poets or painters that had made their home in Mexico City? In order to answer these questions, let's look a bit more closely at John Dos Passos's comings and goings in the 1920s.  </p>

<p>Dos Passos first became interested in Mexico in 1914, when he read John Reed's <i>Insurgent Mexico, </i>but he did not travel there until 1926, when he wrote several articles for <i>New Masses</i> about Mexican muralism and the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Shortly after the launch of <i>New Masses</i> in 1926, Dos Passos wrote a long, enthusiastic profile on Diego Rivera's murals at the Ministry of Education in Mexico City, but it is unclear if he ever 

<b></b>

met Rivera in person.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  He also published some impressions about the noise, poverty, and chaos of Mexico City, as well as a short article on the lot of peasants in the state of Morelos, where the revolutionary Zapata had lived and fought.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  During this trip Dos Passos also painted several watercolors based on his impressions: <i>Man with Hat </i>[<a href="#1">re 1</a>] and <i>Trio with Straws</i> [<a href="#2">re 2</a>]. Both of these works reveal a fascination with the people of the Mexican countryside; they appear as mysterious, hermetic beings that seem frozen in another era.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  He went back to New York in March 1927, but would return to Mexico in 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1946, though he only wrote about his experiences during the 1926–27 trip (except for the fictionalized Mexico City that appears in <i>The 42</i><sup>nd</sup><i> Parallel</i>).<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The dearth of material on Dos Passos's visit to Mexico has led his biographers to conclude that these trips were of little or no importance. They did not seem to have left an important mark on his work, and perhaps were no more than extended holidays for the American writer. The Mexico journeys, for instance, receive no more than a passing mention in Virginia Spencer Carr's biography <i>Dos Passos: A Life</i>.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  And Melvin Landsberg asserts that the Mexico trips were rather inconsequential since "it was the Bolshevik and not the Mexican revolution that Dos Passos heard about constantly and discussed with his associates in the theater and staff of <i>New Masses</i>." <sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  </p>

<p>There is, however, some evidence that there was more to Dos Passos's journeys to Mexico—especially the 1926–27 trip—than first meets the eye. Dos Passos met at least one foreign artist during his first trip: the Italian-born photographer Tina Modotti, who lived in Mexico for most of the 1920s and photographed him wearing a <i>sarape</i> and standing next to a man wearing a sombrero. Modotti did not comment on their meeting, but she did annotate her portrait by writing "Dos Passos" on the photographic print [<a href="#3">re 3</a>].  </p>

<p>But there were some more significant encounters during Dos Passos's first trip to Mexico. He met Salvado Novo, an extravagant young poet who was one of the founders of the avant-garde journal <i>Contemporáneos</i> and the author of several books of experimental poetry and an erotic autobiography that was so scandalous that it was only published in the 1990s.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In the spring of 1927 Novo accompanied Dos Passos on a short road trip to the mountains near Puebla. Novo, an enthusiastic reader of American poetry—he had translated Carl Sandburg for one of the literary journals he edited –, had founded an experimental theater in Mexico City, and was extremely interested in novels that broke out from the constraints of traditional narrative forms, and thus he would have been naturally interested in meeting another experimental novelist. Likewise, Dos Passos probably enthused at the idea of spending a few days with a local writer who could introduce him to the literary and artistic scene in Mexico City. </p>

<p>Their meeting, however, did not end so well. Novo and Dos Passos soon discovered they had very little in common and they disagreed on everything from politics to traveling styles. Dos Passos had come to Mexico hoping to meet peasants whose lives had been transformed by the Revolution—the type of citizens portrayed in Rivera's murals – and who could tell him about land reform, revolutionary politics, and socialist art. Novo, in contrast, was an upper middle class dandy who despised the Mexican

<p>We can see how radically different their outlook on the world was by looking at how both authors wrote about Mexico City. In "Relief Map of Mexico," his 1926 article for <i>New Masses</i>, Dos Passos painted the sharp, almost violent clashes of the old and the new, the rich and the poor found on the streets of the capital: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Under the brittle cold sky, under the invariable sun, Mexico City stretches out its gridiron of streets, the green squares full of flowers, the low red vaults, and the towers leaning this way and that, of dusty colonial buildings. On the streets old men with spectacles, young girls, young women in shawls, barefoot children sell lottery tickets, candied cactus and sweet potatoes, chiclets, cigarettes, lottery tickets, chiclets, lottery tickets, chiclets. In the stores the storekeepers, Gallegos, Catalans, Jews, Germans, Frenchmen, shake their heads over the morning's paper. Business is bad, depressed, stagnant. In Sanborn's tearoom, drugstore, department store, citadel of Yanquilandia, traveling men from the States talk about bad business, scare each other with a new revolution every day, and at last apply to their hopes the healing balm of "eventually we'll intervene." [ . . . ] Ten million Mexican peasants and workmen, disunited, confused by political rows, sleeping on a straw mat on the floor, eating off a few tortillas a day and a speck of chile to take away the raw taste of the corn, standing up in their fields against the Catholic Church, against the two world groups of petroleum interests, against the inconceivably powerful financial juggernaut of the Colossus of the North.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p class="continued">Novo, who would later become the official "Chronicler of Mexico City," wrote thousands of pages about Mexico City, but his eye captured a reality that seems entirely different from that depicted by Dos Passos. In <i>El joven</i>, a short autobiographical work written in 1923, he enthuses about the vibrant metropolis that Mexico City had become in the few years since the end of the revolution: </p>

<p>Novo presents Mexico City as a modern, cosmopolitan center full of cars, tramways, billboards, and ubiquitous advertising campaigns. Dos Passos, in contrast, sees a third-world town inhabited by displaced peasants and exploited by unsympathetic foreigners. Novo saw his city's ubiquitous ads as a much needed opening towards the rest of the world, following almost a decade of isolation during the Revolution. Dos Passos, in contrast, would have seen the billboards and slogans as an incursion of American and European capitalism, an intrusion into an otherwise traditional country. </p>

<p>As we can imagine, the two writers made an awkward couple as they traveled through the Mexican countryside. A few days after their trip was completed, Novo published the following account of their journey in the first issue of <i>Ulises</i>, a literary journal he edited with his fellow poet Xavier Villaurrutia.  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>John Dos Passos, originally from Portugal, as his name shows, has lived in the United States for three generations. He has published <i>Three Soldiers</i>, <i>Rocinante </i>[sic] <i>to the Road Again</i>, <i>Manhattan Transfers</i> [sic]. He was hidden among us for one month. We traveled to Puebla together, and I was able to observe that he is bald, cross-eyed, and thirty years old, though he appears younger, as one can suppose. Of the geniuses working in his native land, for instance, he only knows Carl Sandburg personally, but not my friend Ch. Morley. Though he fought in the war as a known soldier, he has no sympathy for Allan Seeger or Joyce Kilmer. He tells me that if they hadn't died in the war . . . He also tells me some other extravagant things: that he used to like the poetry of Juan Ramón Jiménez when he was learning Spanish. Now he speaks it very well. He has a terrible memory. He eats a lot. One day, as he was preparing to travel to Oaxaca, he went back to New York to work on a play. We've decided to call him John Two Step.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> <b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Novo was a witty writer with a black sense of humor, and he never missed an opportunity to make fun of his more earnest colleagues, especially if they were, like Dos Passos, foreigners in search of an idealized Mexico. </p>

<p>Novo was amused to discover that he, a Mexican, knew more about American poetry —or at least about a certain type of American poetry—than Dos Passos. Christopher Morley, Alan Seeger, and Joyce Kilmer were all authors that Novo read enthusiastically but were unfamiliar to Dos Passos. Ironically, Dos Passos's novels were virtually unknown in the Spanish-speaking world—Novo remarks twice that he had not read Dos Passos—until 1929, when the first translation of <i>Manhattan Transfer</i> was published in Spain.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Novo wrote a longer, more detailed account of their road trip for <i>El Universal Ilustrado</i>, an illustrated weekly edited by Carlos Noriega Hope that had become one of the liveliest platforms for young artists and writers and regularly featured works by artists like Diego Rivera and Tina Modotti, as well as poetry and essays by young writers. In this piece, called simply "México-Puebla," Novo parodies Dos Passos's telegraphic, impressionistic style as he recounts their journey, switching from Spanish to English and back again, and throwing a few sarcastic jabs at his fellow traveler. Consider, for instance, Novo's opening paragraph: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>A fine morning this is. ¿A qué hora empezaremos a hablar de literatura? John dos Passos. Por tres generaciones ha vivido en los Estados Unidos. Yo no conozco sus libros. No es tan famoso, o qué pasa. Ahora pela una naranja y se la come. Brrrr!<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> </p>
<p>[<i>A fine morning this is</i>. When do we start talking about literature? John Dos Passos. For three generations he has lived in the United States. I haven't read his books. He's not that famous or what's the problem. He peels an orange and eats it. Brrr!]</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">As before, Novo makes fun of what he perceived as Dos Passos's American eccentricities. As someone living in a racially mixed culture in which ethnic origins were less important than a national identity that claimed to supersede racial difference—the post-revolutionary national discourse proclaimed that all Mexicans were <i>mestizos</i>– , Novo must have found odd the American custom of identifying one's ethnicity based on the nationality of ancestors who emigrated in a distant past. Parodying this custom, he writes that Dos Passos "has lived in the United States for three generations."  </p>

<p>Throughout the article, Novo debunks Dos Passos's vision of Mexico as an exotic land. "All these American journalists," he writes, "are like detectives in a film. They've come to discover something." Novo refuses to be the native subject, the exotic other, and goes on to mock his travel companion's fascination with the country's most popular tourist attractions. On the way to Puebla, for instance, the pair drove by the Popocatepetl, an active volcano on the edge of the Valley of Mexico and one of the most dramatic symbols of the Mexican countryside. Dos Passos must have been impressed as they contemplated the massive peak, but Novo gives the following irreverent account of their journey:

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>¡Oh! ¡el Popocatepetl! Odioso mamarracho. Se le ve desde todas partes. Lo pintan en los teatros y en algunos cafés. También hay tarjetas postales. Fume nu. .. Están decorando ese monte. Va a parecer un cake de chocolate con el letrero completo. Otra vez ese mamarracho con nubes de trapo. Tiene nieve de mal sabor. Coloso, vigía, todos los adjetivos. Hay muchos otros. ¡Hasta cuándo se hundirá de una vez?<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> </p>
<p>[Oh, Popocatepetl! What a hideous pile. It can be seen from all places, even on the wall paintings inside theaters and coffee houses. And on postcards. "Smoke Numb . . . " They're decorating this hill. It's going to end up looking like a chocolate <i>cake</i> with a sign and everything. Again that pile and its fake clouds. Covered with ice, but not creamy enough. Colossus, beacon, followed by all the adjectives. And there are many others. When will it sink for good?]</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Novo had another occasion to parody local color when he and Dos Passos drove by a village festival, which the Mexican poet describes as follows:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Ya empe Pum! zó el festival. Ya se ha de ir a acabar, ¿Cuál música oimos? Titutli camixtli huixitli clap clap clalp clap clap clap clap clap. Traducido ya no es lo mismo. Clap clap.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> </p>
<p>[The festival has star-BOOM!-ted. It'll be over soon. What kind of music did we hear? Titutli camixtli huixitli clap clap clalp clap clap clap clap clap. It's not the same in translation: Clap clap.]</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Novo parodies the sound of Indigenous words and names: to foreign ears the village chants sound like "Titutli camixtli huixitli," but only the clapping can be translated. </p>

<p>But perhaps the most interesting part of the text is a bilingual section in which Novo recounts how the two shared a hotel room and suggests that the American novelist might have been less than thrilled to find himself in such close quarters with a gay man: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>En este cuarto John y yo [In this room John and I]. May I call you John? And will you call me Salvador? We sit each evening and never speak ta ta ta tárara tarí lará. Había agua caliente. Ahora no. [There was hot water. But no longer.] I don't mind. But I do. Hello Folkways. This is your room here. Let's go n' have supper ; we still have to visit some night schools.</p>
<p>[ . . . ]</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		What are you reading there, John?</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Why er er de la Selva's.</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Ouh.</p>
<p>Silencio. Si-len-cio. S-S-S-S.</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The article ends on a comical note: Novo and Dos Passos reading in bed, like an old married couple, one hushing the other so he can continue reading undisturbed. Strange bedfellows indeed! </p>

<p>In the end, not much came out of John Dos Passos's encounter with Novo, a writer so irreverent and so acerbic that it would not be unfair to characterize him as the Mexican avant-garde's foremost bitchy queen. Their encounter was as ill-fated as the legendary meeting between Proust and Joyce: two writers who everyone imagined would have much in common but who ultimately had nothing to talk about.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Dos Passos met other poets during his brief stay in Mexico City, and some of his literary encounters were to be more productive—and probably more pleasant—than his road trip with Novo. He was introduced, for instance, to Manuel Maples Arce, the founder of Estridentismo, an avant-garde movement loosely based on Italian Futurism that had been active in Mexico City since 1921. Maples Arce was also Novo's archrival in the capital's small but explosive literary scene. </p>

<p>At the time of Dos Passos's visit, Mexico had not one but two avant-garde movements: the poets gathered around the journal <i>Contemporáneos </i>and the Estridentistas (the name translates as "noise makers"), who published the journals <i>Irradiador</i> and <i>Horizonte</i> in the 1920s. The two groups were considered avant-garde but they could not be more different: the Contemporáneos consisted of young poets who, like Novo, read French and English, admired Joyce and Proust, and wrote about the literary scene in Paris, Madrid, London, and New York; the Estridentistas, in contrast, penned outrageous manifestoes proposing, among other things, sending "Chopin to the electric chair," and urging readers to come "Down with Father Hidalgo," one of Mexican founding fathers.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The Contemporáneos were, for the most part, uninterested in politics, or at considered poetry as a practice that went beyond political matters. Their poems explored transcendental themes like love, death, desire and melancholy. The Estridentistas, in contrast, were fiercely political: they considered their movement as a literary extension of the Mexican Revolution, and believed avant-garde experiments were part and parcel of social activism, and wrote poetry about labor unions, worker revolts, and political manifestations. The Contemporáneos read Joyce in well-appointed salons; the Estridentistas postered their manifestoes on city streets and marched in workers' parades. The Contemporáneos were a gay-friendly group; the Estridentistas, in contrast, were known for homophobic pronouncements and their defense of a "virile" Mexican literature.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  One of the lines in <i>Urbe</i> lambasts the "asalta-braguetas literarios" or "literary crotch-gropers"—a not so subtle reference to the sexual tastes of several members of the Contemporáneos group.  </p>

<p>Had Dos Passos gone on a road trip with one of the Estridentistas instead of Novo, his experience would have been completely different. Bt though he did not travel with a member of the group, he did read their work, and was so impressed with <i>Urbe</i>, Manuel Maples Arce's best known poem, that he translated it into English: he called it <i>Metropolis</i> and published it in New York. The book, featuring a color frontispiece illustrating the modern city hailed by Maples Arce [<a href="#4">re 4</a>], was self-published—the cover merely states "New York, 1929"—and is now extremely rare. One of the few remaining copies is at the New York Public Library. </p>

<p>Maples Arce had originally published <i>Urbe</i> in 1924, a year before <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>, and its full title was <i>Urbe: superpoema bolchevique en cinco cantos</i> [Urbe: super-Bolshevik poem in five cantos], and was dedicated to "the workers of Mexico." In it, Maples Arce hails the modern metropolis, bustling with cars and tramways, crowded with workers and factories. It features the same Dionysian enthusiasm for modernity and machinery found in F.T. Marinetti's manifestoes, with the difference, of course, that Mexico City in 1920 was less industrial and less modern than European capitals 

<b></b>

in 1909. The industrial cityscape presented in verses like "O city all tense / with cables and strains /all humming with motors and wings" was an imaginary space, a far cry from the everyday reality of Mexico City, where modernity coexisted with tradition: there were "cables" and "motors" but also <i>pulquerías</i> and horse-drawn carriages.</p>

<p>Although Maples Arce opened his first manifesto of Estridentismo by invoking Marinetti, his theory of the relation between politics and literature was significantly different from that proposed by the Italian poet. Unlike Marinetti, Maples Arce believed that modernity went hand-in-hand with socialist reforms. Progressive politics are as modern as the machines celebrated in <i>Urbe</i>, and workers' manifestations are one more element of the city's modernization depicted in the poem: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p><i>The rivers of blue overalls <br />
overflow the dams of the factories<br />
and the agitator trees<br />
gesticulate speeches.<br /> 
Strikers pelt each other<br />
with stones and insults <br />
and life is one tumultuous <br />
conversion to the left.</i><sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 

<b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">And unlike Marinetti, who lambasted writers who wrote poetry about women, Maples Arce has no problem inserting an old-fashioned love poem ("Poor Celia Maria Dolores<i> . . . </i>") in the midst of his mechanical stridencies. He even manages to sneak in a couple of surrealist images by evoking the name of a random hick town in his bustling metropolis ("Ocotlán / there in the distance"). </p>

<p>It is easy to see why, of all the publications he might have discovered in Mexico City, Dos Passos decided to translate <i>Urbe</i>, a poem that is remarkably similar, in its focus, imagery, and use of language, to <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>. Like Dos Passos's most famous novel, <i>Urbe</i> depicts urban modernity, celebrating the energy and violence found in spaces where millions vie for success. "Metropolis," the term Dos Passos chose for the English translation of Maples Arce's poem, is also the title of the second section of <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>. Novo was also an enthusiast of the modern city, but unlike Maples Arce and Dos Passos he was not interested in documenting the social tensions, the juxtaposition of riches and squalor that readers find in both <i>Urbe</i> and <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>.  </p>

<p>Like <i>Manhattan Transfer</i>, <i>Urbe</i> juxtaposes images from urban life to create a kaleidoscopic text.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Consider, for instance, the following paragraph from Dos Passos's novel describing a character admiring a fireworks display: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Rockets spurting bright in the blue dusk, colored balls falling, Bengal fire, Uncle Jeff tacking pinwheels on the tree outside the apartmenthouse door, lighting them with his cigar. Roman candles you have to hold. "Be sure and turn your face away, kiddo." Hot thud and splutter in your hands, eggshaped balls soaring, red, yellow, green, smell of powder and singed paper.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Dos Passos moves with dizzying speed from one location to another (from the sky to the city street), from object to object, and from characters' thoughts to their actions, just like Maples Arce does in <i>Urbe</i>: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p><i>This new depth of landscape<br />
is a projection onto inner mirrorings.<br />Roaring crowds <br />today overflow the city squares <br />and the triumphal hurrahs <br />of the Obregonistas<br />rattle in the sun of the facades.<br />O romantic girl<br />all a flareup of fold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps between my hands <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only these live moments will remain.<br />The hills dressed in yellow <br />were asleep behind the windowglass<br />and the trammeled city <br />has been left trembling in the wires.<br />That wall is all handclapping. </i><b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Like <i>Manhattan Tranfer</i>, <i>Urbe</i> moves from a wide perspective over the cityscape to a narrow focus on individual characters, from panoramas to close-ups and back again.  </p>

<p>As a translator, Dos Passos proved to be extremely conservative. His translation is, for the most part, a literal, word-for-word rendition of Maples Arce's Spanish poem that ends up sounding rather cumbersome ("The show windows carry the sidewalks by storm / and the sun is sacking the long avenues"). He does not manage to recreate the energy of the original poem. One of MMA's characteristically violent exclamations, for instance: "Los discursos marihuanos / de los diputados / salpicaron de mierda su recuerdo" is rendered as "The speeches doped with marihuana / of the deputies / splatter crap on her memory." The message is there, but not the explosive use of language. Nevertheless, his was the first English translation of an Estridentista text –and, as far as I know, it is still the only one available –, though it remains virtually unknown. <i>Metropolis</i> is republished here for the first time since 1929.  </p>

<p>Dos Passos's first trip to Mexico City was significant for his divergent meetings with the capital's avant-gardes. His road trip with Novo reads like a comical demonstration of the fundamental incompatibility between two world visions. His discovery of Maples Arce, in contrast, lead to a fruitful intellectual exchange: Dos Passos became, at least for some time, the American ambassador of the Estridentista movement, translating and promoting its works abroad.  </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;	<i>The show windows carry the sidewalks by storm</i>

<i> Here is my poem:</i>
<br />
<i>Garlands of hurrahs streaming in the wind,</i>
<br />
 <i>flaring hair,</i>
<br />
<i>captive mornings in all eyes</i>.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>O city</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> full of music</i>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>built all out of mechanical rhythm.</i>
<br />

<p>
<i>This new depth of landscape
<br />
is a projection onto inner mirrorings.
<br />
 Roaring crowds
<br />
today overflow the city squares
<br />
and the triumphal hurrahs
<br />
of the Obregonistas
<br />
rattle in the sun of the facades.
<br />
 O romantic girl
<br />
all a flareup of fold,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps between my hands
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only these live moments will remain.
<br />
The hills dressed in yellow
<br />
were asleep behind the windowglass
<br />
and the trammeled city
<br />
has been left trembling in the wires.
<br />
That wall is all handclapping.
<br />
 "Good God".
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be afraid, it's the tidal wave of the crowd,
<br />
latter on the fringe of silence
<br />
we'll see the Aztec night grow to immensity.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Put out the light in the chandelier.
<br />
Among the mechanism of sleeplessness
<br />
desire with a million eyes
<br />
strokes the poor flesh."
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A steel bird
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has set its course for a star.
<br />
The harbor:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burning distances,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; factory smoke,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
above the orchestra tent
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her memory suns itself.
<br />
An overseas farewell leapt out from the shore.
<br />
 The motors sing
<br />
across the slaughtered landscape</i>

<p>
<i>The afternoon shot full of windows
<br />
floats above the telephone wires
<br />
and among the inverted
<br />
girders of this hour
<br />
hang bunches of mechanical goodbyes.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her marvelous youth
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went off one morning
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between my fingers
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in the empty ponds
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of looking glasses
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shipwreck forgotten faces.
<br />
 The poor sindicalist city
<br />
scaffolded all over
<br />
with cries and hurrahing.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Workmen
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are red
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and yellow.
<br />
 Pistols have burst again into bloom
<br />
after the trample of speeches,
<br />
and while the lungs of the sick wind
<br />
suppurate,
<br />
 lost in the obscure corridors of music
<br />
some white sweetheart
<br />
shatters into withered petals.</i> </p>

<h2>4 </h2>

<p>
<i>Among the thickets of silence
<br />
Dusk licks up the blood of twilight.
<br />
The fallen stars
<br />
are dead birds
<br />
in the dreamless water
<br />
of the mirror.
<br />
 And the sonorous
<br />
Artillery of the Atlantic
<br />
faded away at last
<br />
into the distance.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the autumn trees
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breathes the night wind
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wind off Russia,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wind of immense tragedies.
<br />
 And the garden
<br />
yellowing
<br />
founders in shadow.
<br />
Suddenly the recollection of her
<br />
Sparkles in the dull room.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her gold words</i>

<b></b>

 <br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>sift over my memory.
<br />
The rivers of blue overalls
<br />
overflow the dams of the factories
<br />

<br />
gesticulate speeches.
<br />
Strikers pelt each other
<br />
with stones and insults
<br />
and life is one tumultuous
<br /></i>
conversion to the left.

</p>

 <p>
<i>At the edge of the pillow
<br />
the night is a sheer cliff
<br />
and sleeplessness
<br />
stays whirring in my brain.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Whose are these voices
<br />
skimming over the dark?
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And those trains howling
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards gutted horizons.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soldiers
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will sleep in hell tonight.</i>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>God,
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of all this disaster
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only a few scraps
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so white
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of her memory
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are left in my hands. </i> </p>

<p>
<i>The savage hordes of the black night
<br />
threw themselves on the shuddering town.
<br />
 The bay

all flowering
<br />
with masts and moons
<br />
pours out
<br />
over the gentle piano-score
<br />
her hands play,</i>
</p>

<p>

<br /><i>and the far away cry
<br />
of a steamboat
<br />
towards the northern sea:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodbye
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a shipwrecked continent.</i>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Between the wires of her name
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fluttered feathers of birds.</i>

<b></b>

 <br />
<i>Poor Celia Maria Dolores;
<br />
The landscape is inside us.
<br />
Under the axestrokes of silence
<br />
the cast-iron buildings crumble.</i>

</p>
<p>
 
<i>The waves are of blood and the great hating clouds.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Desolation.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The speeches doped with marihuana
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the deputies
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; splatter crap on her memory,
<br />
 but
<br />
over the surging crowds of my soul
<br />
she has sifted her gentleness.</i>

</p>

<p>

<i>Ocotlan
<br />
there in the distance.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Voices.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detonations
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go pecking among the trenches.
<br />
 Desire threw stones all night
<br />
at the darkened windows of some virginity.</i>

</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Machinegun fire
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hacks off hunks of silence.</i>

</p>

<p>
<i>The streets
<br />
reverberating, empty
<br />
are rivers of darkness
<br />
pouring into the sea
<br />
and the sky
<br />
threadbare
<br />
is the new

 flag
<br />
that flares

over the city.</i></p>

<p>Most Hemingway scholars are familiar with the anecdote regarding Maxwell Perkins's squeamishness when it came to discussing editorial changes in <i>A Farewell to Arms. </i>According to his biographer A. Scott Berg, Perkins had informed Charles Scribner that there were three words that couldn't possibly be printed in Hemingway's latest book, which both men knew could cement their new author's reputation after the success of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>. However, when Scribner asked what the words were, Perkins was apparently incapable of uttering them aloud, and instead had to write them down. A more apocryphal version has it that Perkins had written the words—"fucking," "cocksucker," and "shit"—on his calendar under the heading "Things To Do Today."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It is informative to read this relatively obscure anecdote alongside the most famous passage in <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, indeed one of the most well-known passages in modern American literature: Frederic Henry's thoughts on the relation between language and war. These lines were almost instantly recognized not only as a credo for the austere clarity of Hemingway's literary style, but also as an eloquent expression of the disenchantment of the "lost generation" he had come to represent.  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and had read them, on proclamations, now

for a long time, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had not glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">There is a certain irony in Hemingway's choice of the word "obscene" to describe such "abstract" words, since it would be for the implied use of highly "concrete" words that <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> would be briefly banned for obscenity in Boston, and over which Hemingway would struggle painstakingly with Perkins before the publication of the book that would establish his status as a major American novelist. Most of these words, interestingly enough, appear—or rather fail to appear—in the harrowing description of the Caporetto retreat that follows the above passage. It is from these pages that Hemingway was persuaded by Perkins to remove "fucking," "cocksucker" and "shit," replacing them with cryptic blanks. </p>

<p>In the following discussion, I will rehearse these frequently amusing struggles between editor and author, which involved almost every book Hemingway published with Scribner's under Perkins's guidance. Then I will turn to D.H. Lawrence's refusal, in the very year of <i>A Farewell to Arms'</i> publication, to remove a similar group of words from <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> which, as a result, circulated as an underground pornographic classic for the next thirty years, precisely the period during which Anglo-American modernism was canonized in the academy. I will conclude with a discussion of the trials of <i>Lady Chatterley</i> in England and America, after which dirty words could be published freely, alongside Grove Press's publicity campaign for the unexpurgated edition, which made much of this freedom. Grove Press publisher Barney Rossett's eagerness to print dirty words contrasts serviceably with Perkins's reluctance; the two struggles—one to omit the words and one to include them—can therefore be understood as periodizing markers of the inception and dissolution of modernism in the Anglophone cultural field. Indeed, it is felicitous that the term "four-letter word" first appears in the OED in 1934, and that all the words to which this term refers first appeared in the Penguin English Dictionary in 1965.  </p>

<p>I intend to establish the centrality of so-called dirty words, then, not only for any understanding of Hemingway and Lawrence's considerably different literary styles but also of Anglo-American modernism more generally. Indeed, many mostly male Anglophone writers of the mid-twentieth century, from James Joyce to William Burroughs, were deeply invested in the significance of a mere handful of words that they insisted were integral to their literary projects. In the many trials and controversies that resulted from this insistence, these words in turn came to play a central role in public debates over the nature and significance of literary modernism in the Anglo-American world. </p>

<p>Before examining the Hemingway/Perkins correspondence, I would like quickly to jump forward in time to the American trial of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>, at which 

<b></b>

literary critic and lost generation chronicler Malcolm Cowley testified to the shifting cultural significance of this handful of highly charged words: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>there are a certain number of short Anglo-Saxon words for bodily functions that were regarded until World War I as being wholly part of a secret language of men, comparable to the secret language of men that the anthropologists have found in the South Pacific tribes. These words were used in the smoking room, in the bar room, in the barbershop, but no woman was supposed to know them unless she was an utterly degraded woman. After World War I, women increasingly demanded admission to what had been the sacred places of men, the smoking room, the barroom, the barbershop even, and demanded knowledge of the secret language of men. So that there came one word after another in one novel after another. Some literary historian should follow the fate of these four-letter words, when they first appeared, which of the first words appeared in Hemingway's <i>Farewell to Arms </i>in 1929, which of the words first appeared here in <i>Ulysses</i>, when it was introduced in 1931; which of the words appeared in, let us say, <i>The Naked and the Dead, From Here to Eternity</i> and, more lately,</p>

<p class="continued">It's been almost half a century since this landmark testimony, and still no literary historian has responded to Cowley's call. I intend, somewhat belatedly and partially, to do so here. First, however, I would like to comment on the specific euphemistic terminology that Cowley uses, since these words were almost invariably described as Anglo-Saxon, even though few of them are of certain Anglo-Saxon derivation (indeed, the etymology of dirty words is notoriously hard to trace). Furthermore, it was likewise emphasized that these words constituted a language of men, usually lower-class men at war.  </p>

<p>The Australian linguist Ruth Wajnryb has recently affirmed that "wars do great things for the spread of swear words," and certainly the initial controversies over the publication of these words occurred in the context of accurately representing the speech of soldiers in World War I, especially in <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> and the English translation of Erich Maria Remarque's <i>All Quiet on the Western Front.</i><sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Not only does this periodization affirm the congruence of these controversies with the inception of literary modernism, it also places them in the larger world-historical context of the transition from the British Empire to the American Century. The emphasis on the "Anglo-Saxon" derivation of these terms, I would argue, must be understood as part of an attempt both to fetishize the language of soldiers as representative of national vernaculars and, coordinately, to affirm a certain Anglophone cultural hegemony in the context of literary modernism's internationalist pretensions in the wake of the Great War. As Paul Fussell notes, the use of obscenity amongst soldiers in WWI was frequently red in literary terms: "the intensifier of all work was <i>fucking,</i> pronounced <i>fuckin'</i>, and one exhibited one's quasi-poetic talents by treating it with the greatest possible originality."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  A 1931 anthology of <i>Songs and Slang of the British Soldier</i> affirms the imperial extensions of this vernacular poetics, insofar as fuck "is known all over the world as the English curse <i>par excellence</i>. Street urchins will spit it at you in Cairo, Bombay, Cape Town, Shanghai and probably in Labrador and Paraguay as well."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This effort to forge folk poetry out of military obscenity was ballasted by a coordinate affirmation of the lower-class provenance of these terms, in contrast to the more bourgeois 

<b></b>

connotations of the euphemisms used to refer to them, which were invariably of Latin derivation. Thus Morris Ernst, Bennet Cerf's lawyer for the landmark American trial of <i>Ulysses</i>, opens his 1928 study <i>To the Pure</i> with what he calls "the six deadly adjectives—<i>obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent, </i>and <i>disgusting</i>—which are the basis of censorship."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  These words—vague, abstract, polysyllabic—contrast notably with the short, concrete terms—George Carlin's seven dirty words—which they describe; thus Ernst affirms that his book will have "an Anglo-Saxon cast."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  It was not uncommon to trace this linguistic peculiarity to the Norman Conquest, and the consequent development of an English national vernacular in opposition to aristocratic French. Thus the linguist Allen Walker Read opens his 1934 essay meditating on the word "fuck" as what he calls "An Obscenity Symbol": "The obscene 'four letter words' of the English language are not cant or slang or dialect, but belong to the oldest and best established element of the English vocabulary."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  And Lawrence Durrell, in his 1968 preface to <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover,</i> speculates: "it has always struck me as curious that most, if not all, the banned words seem to be of Saxon provenance, while the euphemisms constructed to convey the same meanings are of Latin-French. Does this argue some great split in the British conscience—a split occurring very far back in history when the Normans were the rulers?"<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The emphasis on Anglo-Saxon derivation, then, affirms the linguistic power and pedigree of an Anglophone vernacular in the face of political and artistic developments that were vitiating the integrity of nation-states.  </p>

<p>This "power" is invariably red as masculine. Thus Otto Jespersen, in his foundational study <i>Growth and Structure of the English Language</i>, opens with the claim that English "seems to me positively and expressly <i>masculine</i>, it is the language of a grown-up man and has very little childish or feminine about it."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  And Geoffrey Hughes, one of the few literary scholars to write on swearing, claims that, "Anglo-Saxon poetry is largely 'androcentric' . . . just as most romance is 'gynocentric'."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Soldiers in WWI, of course, were men, and Cowley's assumption that dirty words are the language of men was shared by those who participated in the controversies over these texts. C.H. Rolph, editor of <i>The Trial of Lady Chatterley, </i>notes "obscenity trial jurors were invariably male, thanks to a patriarchal provision in the law . . . allowing judges to exclude women from trials which featured evidence of a sexual nature."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The United States had no such provision, which resulted in some symptomatic, and amusing, <i>contre-temps</i>. For instance, in the 1920 New York obscenity trial over the publication of excerpts from <i>Ulysses</i> in the <i>Little Review</i>, one of the judges indicated that the book should not be read aloud in front of the woman in the room. When notified that Margaret Anderson, the woman in question, was the publisher of the text, he claimed "I am sure she didn't know the significance of what she was publishing."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Similarly, Sam Coleman, the attorney representing the government in the case of <i>The United States v. one book called "Ulysses"</i>  is said to have whispered to defense attorney Morris Ernst that he couldn't properly prosecute the case, because he couldn't read "four-letter words" aloud with "a lady in the courtroom." Ernst, realizing that the woman in question was his wife, assured Coleman that "she's seen all these words on toilet walls," but Coleman was adamant, and refused to read aloud from the text.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>As these anecdotes indicate, and as Cowley's quote above affirms, the controversies over dirty words in literary texts occurred in the context of changing protocols in the heretofore gendered divisions of language use in the Anglophone world. In particular, the bohemian circles out of which much modernism emerged, from Bloomsbury to Paris to Greenwich Village, were engaged in challenging these protocols. As historian Christine Stansell affirms, "a willingness to tolerate looseness in what women said and how they presented themselves in saying it" was one of the defining features of turn-of-the-century bohemian society.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Stansell argues that these "conversational communities" set the standards for modern middle class sociability. According to Bernard de Voto, writing for <i>Harper's Magazine</i> in 1948, she's correct: "toleration of the monosyllables and occasional and even habitual use of some of them has come to signify frankness, sophistication, liberalism, companionability, and even smartness among a very great many educated and well-to-do metropolitan women."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The use of dirty words in mixed company, then, gradually came to signify modernity itself. </p>

<p>However, the authors of the texts that chronicled and represented these developments were almost invariably male, such that the controversies over dirty words in literature can partly be understood as an ambivalent attempt on the part of these men to reappropriate and reinscribe the purportedly masculine force of the Anglophone vernacular. As Nina Miller, in her important study <i>Making Love Modern: The Intimate Public Worlds of New York's Literary Women,</i> affirms, "the most visible experience of the situation we are calling modern was one of male crisis, and the most quintessentially modern response was a clearly marked style of masculinity."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Cowley handily illustrates this response when he concludes the above portion of his testimony with, "I don't like this new fashion of using those four-letter words all over the place. I would rather keep them for the secret language of men. I am very much against the abolition of the smoking room and the bar room."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Dirty words in mid-century, then, were associated with a very specific ethnographic group: lower-class English-speaking men, the "folk" of the modern Anglophone world. Thus Cowley's invocation of anthropological discourse to specify the nature of these words is noteworthy. His analogy between barber shop banter and sacred tribal language may or may not be accurate, but it does indicate a persistent belief in modern anthropology that there is something both primitive and primal about dirty words. Indeed, most of the surprisingly few studies of cursing and swearing have been written by anthropologists. Thus Ashley Montagu, in his 1967 study <i>The Anatomy of Swearing</i> affirms that such a project is "long overdue."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  And he begins by noting that "many philologists have held that speech originated in utterances closely akin to swearing" . He then speculates as to the corporeal logic of this origination: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>This need was fundamentally a physiological one and was only secondarily psychological. Such expletive sounds were not invented by man but were physiologically determined for him by the shape of his chest and the form of his nasal cavities, throat, and larynx.</p>

	<div class="attrib">

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">According to Montagu, language began out of our frustration with the intransigence of the material world, since, as he amusingly comments, "there is an inherent malice 

<b></b>

in inanimate objects, which some speak of as Resistentialism, the conspiracy among inanimate objects to resist the incursions and manipulations of the animate world" . Swearing, then, is the physiological response of the animate body to the resistance of the inanimate world. From these material origins emerges a magical understanding of language as performative, an understanding in which words function as things. Thus Montague argues, citing Malinowski, that "The study of the language of nonliterate peoples has revealed the fact that words play the part essentially of <i>implements</i>. Words are regarded as capable of <i>doing</i> things" . In this view, words begin as a physiological response to the environment and then develop into a functional practice of acting on that environment. </p>

<p>This understanding of words as things was central to modern anthropology's theorization of the sacred languages of "primitive" peoples.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In James Gordon Frazier's magisterial and encyclopedic <i>The Golden Bough</i>, whose influence on literary modernism was immense, the author provides an analysis of "Tabooed Words" that quite clearly relies on the same logic as Montagu's later study: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Unable to discriminate clearly between words and things, the savage commonly fancies that the link between a name and the person or thing denominated by it is not a mere arbitrary and idea association, but a real and substantial bond which unites the two in such a way that magic may be wrought on a man just as easily through his name as through his hair, his nails, or any other material part of his person.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Montagu's speculations as to the origins of language and Frazier's understanding of primitive taboos, then, presume that "savages" confuse words both with the things to which they refer and the bodies from which they emerge. Five years after the release of Frazier's study, his contemporary Robert Graves would satirize his analysis in <i>Lars Porsena, or the Future of Swearing and Improper Language,</i> affirming that, in refusing to apply these conclusions to his own national religion and language, Frazier "clings to the very superstition which he records among primitive tribes."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  According to Graves, in other words, the very "superstitions" that apparently dictate the savage use of language also characterize the "civilized" discourses of the modern anthropologist.  </p>

<p>It is, I would like to claim, in this constitutive ambiguity of the anthropological distinction between primitive and modern understandings of language that the ultimate significance of dirty words for literary modernism can be located. Indeed, it is felicitous for my purposes that Hemingway's first dispute with Perkins occurred over a considerably complex combination of libel and obscenity. Perkins was concerned about the discussion between Jake Barnes and Bill Gorton in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, where the two men refer to Henry James's alleged impotence. In one of his earliest editorial letters to Hemingway, he writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I swear I do not see how it can be printed. It could not by any conception be printed while he was alive, if only for the fear of a lawsuit; and in a way it seems almost worse to print it after he is dead. I am not raising this you must believe because we are his publishers. The matter referred to is a peculiarly personal one.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The fear of libeling James here can re as a modern equivalent to Frazier's savage superstitions about naming, but the specific reference, which is of course more about Jake Barnes then Henry James, links these anxieties about libel both to the problem of obscenity and to the autobiographical extensions of Hemingway's narrative. These concerns would become more explicit when Perkins elaborated on the changes that would be required before Scribner's could safely publish Hemingway's first novel: "There are two points to consider that bear on this publication: the danger of trouble from referring to real people in a way to reflect upon them, and the danger of suppression."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The first included references to Roger Prescott, Hillaire Belloc, James Hergesheimer, and Henry James. As to the second, Perkins elaborates:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The book is of course a healthy book with marked satirical implications upon novels which are not.—Sentimentalized, subjective novels, marked by sloppy, hazy thought. That is one of the first things it is. But as I said, people are afraid of words. We don't want to divert attention from its intrinsic qualities to details of purely extrinsic importance. It would be a pretty thing if the very significance of so original a book should be disregarded because of the howls of a lot of cheap, prurient, moronic yappers. You probably don't appreciate this disgusting possibility because you've been too long abroad, and out of that atmosphere. Those who breathe its stagnant vapors now attack a book, not only on grounds of eroticism which could not hold here, but upon that of 'decency,' which means words. In view of this, I suggest that a particular adjunct of the Bulls, referred to a number of times by Mike, be not spelled out, but covered by a blank.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Hemingway responded by suggesting that "balls" be replaced by "horns." He then sums up the entire editorial process: "We've eliminated Belloc, changed Hergesheimer's name, made Henry James Henry, made Roger Prescott into Roger Prentiss and unfitted the bulls for a reproductive function."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The peculiar conflation of libel and obscenity could not be more economically expressed. And this castration of the bulls would quickly become, for Hemingway, a sort of metonym of the entire censorial process to which Perkins subjected all his books. Thus when Perkins sent him the illustration of the author that was to accompany advertisements for this book, Hemingway responded, "It looks very much like a writer who had been saddened by the loss or atrophy of certain non replaceable parts."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>   </p>

<p>This ring of censorship as emasculation would become far more explicit in Hemingway's struggles with Perkins over <i>A Farewell to Arms.</i> Here Hemingway candidly admits his anxieties to Perkins: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>My point is that the operation of emasculation is a tiny one—It is very simple and easy to perform on men—animals and books—It is not a Major operation but its effects are very great—It is <span class="underline">never</span> performed <span class="underline">intentionally</span> on books—What we must both watch is that it should not be performed unintentionally.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Perkins's response to these concerns is highly significant. He tries to convince Hemingway that they're not really emasculating the book, since at this point the discussion was only over the serialization of the narrative in <i>Scribner's</i> magazine:

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Now this serialization is not the real thing, as the book is. If we considered 'A Farewell to Arms' only in respect to its intrinsic quality, and refused to regard the question from any practical point of view, we would all be dead against serialization. It is an incidental and outside thing, and the best reason for it, to my mind, was on account of the practical aspects of it in widening your public, and in making you understandable to a great many more people, and generally in helping you to gain complete recognition. It is in view of all this that I think—as I judge you do by your letter today—that cuts can be philosophically made, for if we can keep people from being diverted from the qualities of the material itself, by words and passages which have on account of <span class="underline">conventions</span>, an astonishingly exaggerated importance to them, a great thing will have been done. Your mind is so completely free of these conventions—and it is fortunate it is—that you do not realize the strength with which they are held. If you knew a few of the genteel!<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Although Hemingway was not convinced, Perkins's distinction here is crucial for a more general understanding of how and why dirty words were so significant for Anglo-American modernism. Hemingway's concerns operate by way of a metonymically ballasted analogy between author and book. Like the authorial body from which it emerges, the book is an integrated whole. To remove words that refer to bodily parts or functions, then, is tantamount to removing these parts, or eliminating these functions, from the body of the author himself.  </p>

<p>However, as Michael Szalay has recently affirmed, the analogy between texts and bodies in Hemingway in the end supports a crucial difference between them: "Insofar as they are about male bodies, Hemingway's texts are meant to replace those bodies, not as new vessels for human identity but as exemplars of an invulnerable identity entirely unavailable to persons." As Szalay compellingly reasons, male bodies <i>can</i> by mutilated and still be bodies, but, "because the identity of such a text is embedded in each and every word, the loss of any one of its words makes it not a lesser version of the original but something categorically different."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  This something categorically different, though Szalay doesn't pursue it in this direction, is a commodity. Thus, when Hemingway finally concedes to leave cocksucker, fucking, and shit not only out of the serialized version of the novel, that was briefly banned in Boston, but out of the book as well, he writes to Perkins: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>You know we have no ts about money. The only fundamental disagreement was about the words—I<span class="underline"> knew</span> certain ones could be published because I saw them in proof and they were all right—They shocked no one—I <span class="underline">had</span> to have them—It meant everything to the integrity of the book . . . it was cut so it would be able to sell—I've had no interest in it as a <span class="underline">book</span> since. It's something to sell.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Hemingway's literary credo, and by extension one of the fundamental tenets of literary modernism, could not be more emphatically expressed. The "book" has an integrity that, by both analogy <i>and</i> contrast to the authorial body, cannot be modified. But such modification becomes inevitable as a concession to the market, at which point the book becomes simply a commodity for sale. And this process of commodification is simultaneously a process of emasculation insofar as it specifically concerns those few 

<b></b>

words which not only refer to masculine sexual performance but which, by the residually "savage" nature of their linguistic function, are understood as equivalent to it.  </p>

<p>In the very same year that Hemingway was struggling with Perkins over <i>A Farewell to Arms, </i>D.H. Lawrence, dying of tuberculosis in Italy, was writing an essay simultaneously attacking pirated editions of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> and justifying his refusal to expurgate it<i>. </i>In "A Propos of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>," Lawrence proclaimed, using logic strikingly similar to Hemingway's, that "I might as well try to clip my own nose into shape with scissors. The book bleeds."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In a letter to his Italian publisher, he reaffirmed that he would not make a "castrato public edition."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  However, in refusing, unlike Hemingway, to adapt to the marketplace, Lawrence significantly shifted the legal terms that would frame his text's alleged obscenity. With Hemingway, the authenticity of the text conflated obscenity with libel; with Lawrence, the illegitimacy of the text conflated copyright and obscenity since, at that time, it was impossible to copyright a book that had been deemed legally obscene.  </p>

<p>I would like to parallel this shift from libel to copyright with a significant contrast between the role of dirty words in <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms. </i>On the one hand, their role in the wake of the Great War seems very similar, as Lawrence proclaims that "All the great words, it seemed to Connie, were cancelled for her generation: love, joy, happiness, home, mother, father, husband, all these great, dynamic words were half dead now."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  And this cancellation, not surprisingly, becomes associated with Clifford Chatterley, the literary entrepreneur crippled by the war who irritates Connie when he reads her the opening line of Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn." "How she hated words," Connie contemplates, "always coming between her and life: they did the ravishing, if anything did: ready-made words and phrases, sucking all the life-sap out of living things" . "Ravished!" Lawrence then comments, "How ravished one could be without ever being touched. Ravished by dead words become obscene" . Lawrence, then, identifies the same post-war collapse of abstract meaning as Hemingway but, crucially, it is in terms of the sensibilities of a female protagonist. The "obscene" words, correlatively, have less to do with martial than with domestic ideals. </p>

<p>It is Oliver Mellors, of course, the working-class (if ambiguously gentlemanly) gamekeeper, who will bring language back to life through his vernacular speech. Thus although the enlightened Tommy Dukes quips to Connie, "I believe in having a good heart, a chirpy penis, a lively intelligence, and the courage to say 'shit' in front of a lady" , it is Mellors who will introduce her to the more mystical term "cunt" which, in an earlier version of the text, Lawrence designates as "one of the indefinable words of the dialect."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The indefinability of "cunt" is part and parcel of its performative, and putatively therapeutic, power in the text as an illustration of what Lawrence wanted to affirm as "a proper reverence for sex, and a proper awe of the body's strange experience."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  This quasi-mystical effort to "cleanse" or "redeem" the language used for corporeal reference, to convince the reader that dirty words are "a natural part of the mind's consciousness and body," was central to the defense of the unexpurgated <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>However, it is important to note that, unlike with Hemingway, the consciousness and body in question here is not so closely linked to the masculine author. Although Lawrence used the same language of castration and emasculation when discussing possible expurgations of his text, <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>, by its very name and subject matter, was more closely analogized to the female body of its protagonist than the male body of its author. Indeed, Lawrence himself had exulted in a letter to his publisher upon receiving his first copy, "<i>Lady Chatterley</i> came this morning, to our great excitement, and everybody thinks she looks most beautiful . . . Now let us hope she will find her way safely and quickly to all her destinations."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The "Lady" did travel quickly, if not quite safely, far and wide, but without the approval or profit of Lawrence or, after his death in 1929, his widow; the text achieved a certain autonomy, both literary and legal, from its male author, frequently signified by a rative collapse of the gender of the protagonist into the book itself. Thus, when <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover </i>finally went on trial in the United States and Britain, in 1959 and 1960, respectively, it seemed as much a woman as a book that was in the docket. Rolph affirms: "just how much it was she, and not D.H. Lawrence or Penguin books, who was on trial, will appear from the following pages."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  In fact, <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>, quite concretely, was more autonomous from its author than <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>. Since Lawrence refused to expurgate it, he was also unable to copyright it, and thus pirated editions circulated around the world, from which neither Lawrence nor his heirs would profit.  </p>

<p>When Barney Rossett decided to publish an unexpurgated edition, then, his concerns were as much about copyright as obscenity, and he initiated a long and arduous series of attempts to obtain legal permission from Lawrence's heirs (first Frieda Lawrence Ravagli and then, after her death in 1956, her estate as represented by the British Lawyer Laurence Pollinger) which might aid him in suppressing competing editions if he won his case. Thus Charles Rembar would open the American trial of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> with the statement that "our client has important property rights at stake here."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Judge Frederick VanPelt Bryan issued his famous decision on July 21, 1959 and literally within days Rosset's worst fears were realized when New American Library announced that it was issuing "the unexpurgated and complete edition of 'Lady Chatterley's Lover,' under their exclusive license for paperbound reprints of 'Lady Chatterley's Lover,' granted by contract authorized by the author's estate more than 10 years ago, still in full force and effect and just re-confirmed by the Lawrence estate and its literary executors."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  </p>

<p>There ensued a legal battle between New American Library and Grove Press whose commercial terms quite conveniently both mirror and invert those of Perkins's argument with Hemingway over the difference between magazine and book publication. The "paperback revolution" had intervened between the two battles, permanently transforming the entire landscape of book publication.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Now the very words that Perkins had to keep from being published in <i>Scribner's Magazine</i> became precisely the selling point for the flood of "unexpurgated" paperbacks that followed on the heels of Bryan's decision. Rossett brought suit against New American Library, not for copyright infringement, since it had been established that the book was in the public 

<b></b>

domain, but for "seeking to mislead and deceive the public" with its avowals, in both its promotional materials and on its book covers, that its edition was "complete" and "authorized."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  As <i>Publishers' Weekly </i>affirmed, this was less a legal issue than a matter of "the ethics of the publishing industry."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Not only did most industry insiders feel that Rossett's assumption of the original risks of publishing the unexpurgated edition gave him the exclusive right to profit from it, at least initially, but they also acknowledged that "Grove's performance in publishing its $6 hardbound edition of the book and in advertising and promoting it was in keeping with the book's high literary standing," and had indeed been responsible for its legal exoneration.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  If Perkins had insisted that publication in a genteel magazine prior to issuing the hardcover would help establish Hemingway's literary stature, Rossett conversely was afraid that competition between a hardbound and paperbound edition would not only cut into his profits but also damage Grove's (and Lawrence's) literary reputation, upon which he had been able to free the book of obscenity charges in the first place. Now the modernist integrity of the "book" is threatened not by the genteel magazine, but by the salacious paperback reprint.  </p>

<p>On October 2, 1959, Grove and NAL issued a joint statement announcing a settlement of their legal battle, and mutually acknowledging that "The unexpurgated version of 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' published by Grove as well as the unexpurgated version published by New American Library are equally complete, unexpurgated and valid presentations of the author's work."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Nevertheless, Rossett still had to struggle against a flood of reprints issued by less scrupulous rivals, so he circulated a series of ads that quite economically condenses these literary and legal issues. With the heading "DANGER! Pirates at Work," the ad lists a series of warnings against purchasing incomplete or inaccurate editions. These include: "CAUTION! The Lady may be cut"; "INSIST on a complete Lady"; "AVOID the expurgated Lady"; "BEWARE the 'mutilated' Lady"; "Some of the Lady may be MISSING"; and finally "DEMAND all of the Lady!"<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  With the legal publication of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>, then, we've shifted from a logic whereby the expurgated text is understood as a potentially libelous metonym for the castrated authorial body to a logic whereby the unexpurgated text is understood as a metaphor for the complete, if clearly vulnerable, body of the fictional female protagonist who, from Madame Bovary to Connie Chatterley, would float freely in the public domain of modernist preoccupation.  </p>

<p>These complex relays between text and body illuminate the equally complex relations between theories of modernism and definitions of obscenity in the twentieth century. As Walter Benn Michaels affirms, most accounts of literary modernism "acknowledge its interest in the ontology of the sign—which is to say, in the materiality of the signifier." Michaels affirms that one of the central fantasies of modernism involves a wish that the sign "might function, in effect, onomatopoetically, without reliance upon a system of syntactic and semantic conventions."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  I would like to conclude by offering the modernist deployment of dirty words as a central, and heretofore unacknowledged, version of this fantasy and by arguing, furthermore, that this fantasy powerfully informed both the rhetoric of the free speech movement and the practices of radical performance art.

 </p>

<p>One of the more eloquent and influential theories of modern literature is elaborated by Roland Barthes in <i>Writing Degree Zero</i>, in which he affirms that style is rooted in the authorial body: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>A language is therefore on the hither side of Literature. Style is almost beyond it: imagery, delivery, vocabulary spring from the body and the past of the writer and gradually become the very reflexes of his art. Thus under the name of style a self-sufficient language is evolved which has its roots only in the depths of the author's personal and secret mythology, that subnature of expression where the first coition of words and things takes place, where once and for all the great verbal themes come to be installed. Whatever its sophistication, style has always something crude about it: it is a form with no clear destination, the product of a thrust, not an intention.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Barthes concludes: "It is the Authority of style, that is, the entirely free relationship between language and its fleshly double, which places the writer above History as the freshness of innocence."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Barthes's emphasis on the idiosyncrasies of style here cannot belie his reliance on the anthropological theories of language that informed modern understandings of dirty words which, in their primal origins, represent a "coition of words and things," and therefore re as a sort of generic symptom of literary modernism's idealization of style as the "fleshly double" of language. </p>

<p>Barthes's theory is fundamentally focused on the relations between language and the authorial body, and this is indeed as it should be since the ultimate implications of modernist style when theorized in this manner are private and undecipherable, writing degree zero. However, once these texts circulate in the public, they are subjected to an entirely different interpretive paradigm based on the <i>effects</i> such language may have on readers. Thus the famous Hicklin definition of obscenity, which was essentially the law of the land in English speaking countries until the landmark case of <i>The United States v. One Book Called "Ulysses,"</i> deemed that "the test for obscenity is whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Judge John Woolsey, in his famous ruling freeing <i>Ulysses</i> in 1933, did not change this essential emphasis on effects, defining obscenity as "tending to stir the sex impulses or to lead to sexually impure and lustful thoughts."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  The shift to the female body of the protagonist in <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> can be understood in terms of this readerly valence of obscenity. As Frances Ferguson has recently affirmed, "the elision of the immorality of the book with the immorality of the character" makes sense, since "Constance Chatterley herself embodies the very notion of susceptibility that pornography and obscenity statutes were designed to provide armor against."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Legal theories of obscenity, then, were also based on the apparently "savage" understanding of language as performative, as literally acting on the bodies of persons; it's just that they focused on (feminine) readers while the proponents of modernism tended to focus on (masculine) writers. </p>

<p>On July 2, 1961, Ernest Hemingway, struggling with depression and writer's block, shot himself with his favorite shotgun. He had not produced a major text since <i>The Old </i>

<b></b>

<i>Man and the Sea</i> . His literary stock had dropped precipitously, and he would have to wait until the eighties, with the posthumous publication of <i>The Garden of Eden</i>, for his critical resuscitation. The revival of Lawrence, on the other hand, was in full force. Propelled and promoted by an entire stable of literary critics who dedicated their careers to establishing him as an academic industry and disseminating his work throughout the college curriculum in the crucial post-war years of the GI Bill, D.H. Lawrence was one of the most read and written about authors of the sixties.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>   </p>

<p>And his passionate if problematic endorsement of dirty words in <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> would help render visible the crucial links between the free speech movement and the sexual revolution. One example will have to suffice. In March 1965, John Thomson was arrested by the UC Berkeley campus police for holding up a sign on which he had written the word "fuck." The next day, four students set up a table and protested his arrest by reading aloud from <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  The so-called "filthy speech movement" affirmed that the aesthetic significance of dirty words had modulated into an explicitly political register which no longer recognized the sacred integrity of literary texts. In this highly economical conflation of aesthetic subversion and political revolt, the stage was set for Karen Finley and Annie Sprinkle, as the frontiers of the avant-garde shifted from a literary canon dominated by male-authored texts to performance-based events in which the (frequently female) body (and voice) of the artist is also the artwork. But that's the subject for another paper. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT55" href="#REF55">55</a>. The inaugural text of the Lawrence revival is F.R. Leavis's <i>D.H. Lawrence: Novelist </i>(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1955). Leavis has little to say about <i>Lady Chatterley</i>, and he refused to appear as a witness at the British trial, but his boldly stated desire "to win clear recognition for the nature of Lawrence's greatness" , made it acceptable, and indeed fashionable, to champion Lawrence's literary credentials over and against his dismissal by T.S. Eliot and other cultural arbiters of high modernism. After Leavis, then, came the deluge. For a representative cross section, see Harry Moore, <i>The Intelligent Heart </i>(New York: Penguin, 1954) (reprinted as <i>The Priest of Love </i>in 1974), <i>D.H. Lawrence and His World </i>(New York: Viking, 1966); Mark Schorer, <i>D.H.

Lawrence </i>(Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1966); and Eugene Goodheart, <i>The Utopian Vision of D.H. Lawrence </i>(Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1963). Many of these res also appeared as expert witnesses at the trials of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover.</i> Furthermore, and possibly most significant in the end, with the help of Barney Rossett, Sir Allen Lane, and other entrepreneurial post-war publishers, they edited and introduced a battery of anthologies and reprints of Lawrence's massive oeuvre in the sixties.  </p>

<p>The tower was built by Alexander Gustave Eiffel with the assistance of M. Koechlin, E . Nougier and architect Sauvester for the World's Fair in 1889. It was long regarded with distrust, and at the conclusion of its construction, Eiffel himself was the first to ascend to the top. Verlaine, who usually doesn't venture beyond the limits of the Latin quarter, let himself be conveyed there by carriage. But upon seeing it, he fled from the "monster." Later the Eiffelka's praises started to be sung by poets. Cocteau calls it a "lace giraffe, " Apollinaire the "shepherd of bleating bridges; " it appears on the canvases of the Douanier Rousseau, Delaunay, etc. Beneath the Eiffelka is the only plot of land about whose measure experts in the academic world are engaged in an endless dispute. In addition to serving as the setting for children's parties, during which thousands of balloons are released around it, the Eiffelka is also used for various acrobatic attractions. Recently, there was a huge aviation accident when a plane crashed into one of the bottom arches. The Eiffel Tower was leased by Citroën, which erected an advertisement in lights that spanned its entire height, and was lit every night of the year 1926.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p>Intended for Czech visitors to the Eiffel tower, this idiosyncratic and mildly insouciant citation appeared in the 1927 guidebook to Paris written by the Czech painter and photographer Jindřich Štyrský in collaboration with the painter Marie Čermínová, who went by "Toyen." Both members of the Czech avant-garde movement Devětsil, Štyrský and Toyen served as cross-cultural ambassadors enticing their fellow Czechs to venture west to Paris, "the center of knowledge and art, the focus of contemporary culture, the cradle of modern architecture," as the advertisements in the Revue Devětsil or ReD, boasted 

<b></b>

[<a href="#1">re 1</a>].<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> The citation itself is a remarkable illustration of the degree of Francophilia present in the Czechoslovak First Republic (1918–1938), for the authors assume that their Czech readers are entirely familiar with names such as Henri Rousseau, Jean Cocteau, Robert Delaunay and, above all, Guillaume Apollinaire.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  And they would have been correct, because the Czech avant-garde journals of the 1920s—<i>Pásmo</i> , <i>Disk</i> (1923–1924), <i>Život II</i> , <i>ReD</i> (1927–1931)—were replete with articles devoted to the European avant-garde, with a particular focus on the Parisian cultural scene, and included reviews of exhibits, debates, polemics and manifestos, sometimes in the original French.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  For shifting constellations of painters (Josef Šíma, Toyen), photographers (Jaroslav Rössler, Štyrský), poets (Jaroslav Seifert, Vítězslav Nezval) and writers (Karel Čapek, Karel Teige) eager to participate in the international avant-garde and to assert their position on the world stage, Paris was considered the "model of the modern metropolis."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Although connections between France and Bohemia have a long and illustrious history, the interwar period marked an especially intense period of contact between Prague and Paris.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  From the most elevated politician to the ordinary Czech high school student, France was regarded as the spiritual center of European intellectual life—even more so than Germany, despite the significant German-speaking population.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  In the context of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the reasons for this predilection were as political as they were cultural, since the German language connoted the dominance and suppression of the Czech language under the Habsburg Empire. By contrast, France was a powerful ally, and distinguished itself from the rest of Europe as the first country to recognize Czechoslovakia as an independent state.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> President Masaryk, in cooperation with Ernest Denis, established an Institute of Slavic Studies in Paris, which was formally linked to the Sorbonne in 1922.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> By 1938, Czechoslovakia had the highest number of chapters of the Alliance Française compared to the rest of Eastern Europe.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> Given the French interest in Czechoslovakia and the cultural context of the avant-garde, it is not surprising that Czech artists considered living in Paris necessary as a mark of their cultural sophistication.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  </p>

<p>No landmark is more emblematic of Paris than the Eiffel Tower, or the "Eiffelka," as the Czechs affectionately called it. According to Karel Srp, it was "the first place that the steps of Central and Eastern European avant-gardists led to in the 1920s . . . They had themselves photographed on the tower and made it the object of their own photographs, collages, and visual poems."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Moreover, the Eiffel Tower was immortalized in Karel Čapek's 1919 translation of Apollinaire's poem "Zone," which includes Prague in simultaneist vision on a par with Paris, Rome, and Amsterdam. Having just emerged as a newly independent country free from the domination of the Habsburg Empire, the publication of this poem could not have come at a more fortuitous moment for the Czech avant-garde in search of new sources of inspiration. </p>

<p>The Eiffel Tower's imprint on Czech culture was not only literary, but also literal: the "lace giraffe" and "shepherd of bleating bridges" has a particular significance for Czechs, since they constructed their own version. Impressed by the sight of the tower when they traveled to Paris for the exhibition of 1889, the Czech tourist club raised 

<b></b>

funds and commissioned architect František Prašíl to design one for Prague. And thus the Petřínská Rozhleda, conspicuously situated on Petřín hill, was completed in 1891.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> Measuring 60 meters tall, one fifth the height of the original, it has been described as the "pocket-sized counterpart of the celebrated Paris Eiffel Tower" [<i>kapesní protějšek slavné pařížské Eiffelovy věže</i>].<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  At the same time, however, as one of the posters for Prague's 1891 Jubilee Exhibition boasts, the Petřín tower is 380 meters above sea level; by this measure, it would be slightly taller than its predecessor.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Pedestrians strolling along the right bank of the Vltava could look across the river and see the tower rise from the top of Petřín hill, and imagine themselves metaphorically linked to that distant capital in the west. </p>

<p>In what follows, the Paris-Prague connection will be traced in two stages: first, I consider the seminal role of Apollinaire's simultaneist poem "Zone" and its significance for French-Czech relations and for the Czech avant-garde. Second, I analyze how the tower functions not only as a powerful synecdoche for Paris, but also as the embodiment of a modernist vision developed by key res such as Karel Teige, Vítězslav Nezval and Jaroslav Seifert that both encompasses and exceeds its object.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Some of the antic energy of Devětsil, which later morphed into Poetism under Teige's direction, is already apparent from the initial citation on the Eiffel Tower from the <i>Paris Guidebook. </i>Children's parties, thousands of balloons, and acrobats jostle together with an improbable plane crash and an advertisement for Citroën, forming an eclectic tableau that represents a new metropolitan aesthetic in the Czech avant–garde.

<h1 class="sec-headA">
Apollinaire's Prague
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>In March of 1902, Guillaume Apollinaire, originally Kostrowitsky, traveled east to explore a chain of cities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, including Prague. The diary notes from his brief visit there became "Prague Pedestrian,"[<i>Le passant de Prague</i>] the first story he published a few months later under his pen-name Apollinaire.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  When the story's narrator attempts to ask for advice in German about where to stay in Prague, he is corrected by a Czech who speaks to him in French, "In Prague, everyone only speaks Czech. But if you speak French, those who know the language will always happily respond."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  This opening anecdote is of relatively minor importance to the story as a whole, which is a rather fanciful and bawdy reworking of the myth of the "Eternal Jew" set against the landscape of Prague, but it already testifies to the Czech affinity for France and resentment of Austro-Hungarian domination.  </p>

<p>Apollinaire later distilled a few of the images from his trip into his poem "Zone" (1912; revised and republished in <i>Alcools</i> 1913), which famously begins: "You are tired at last of this old world/O shepherd Eiffel Tower the flock of bridges bleats at the morning" [<i>A la fin tu es las de ce monde ancien/Bergère ô tour Eiffel le troupeau des ponts bêle ce matin</i>]. Two stanzas are set in Prague: </p>

<p class="continued">The story that he fails to write in the "garden of an inn on the outskirts of Prague" is in fact the story he has already written, "Prague Pedestrian." As in the story, the gem-encrusted chapel of St. Wenceslas is the scene of the poet's startling, surreal encounter with his own reflection. For Apollinaire, who later invents the term "surrealism," Prague is a magical city that unlocks the fears and memories of the viewer. And just as Apollinaire saw his own reflection in the walls of the chapel, the Czech Devětsil poets saw the image of their own city re-enchanted and reflected back to them in "Zone." These few lines served as a talisman that forged a link between the French and Czech avant-garde, and in cultural terms elevated Prague from the peripheral status of an imperial outpost to a cosmopolitan capital in its own right. "Zone" also had the poignant aura of a dead star, since Čapek's translation of the poem only reached the Czech public in 1919 after Apollinaire had already passed away in 1918.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> </p>

<p>The precise addresses and streets that Apollinaire mentioned in "Zone" and "Prague Pedestrian" became the object of intense speculation that added another layer of legend and mystery to Prague's literary map. Angelo Maria Ripellino, the author of the definitive cultural history of Prague, describes how Karel Toman, Konstantin Biebl and Karel Čapek attempted to find the garden mentioned in the poem.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  French visitors enjoyed following Apollinaire's poetic itinerary; Philippe Soupault traced his steps with his enthusiastic Czech hosts in 1927, and Nezval took Paul Eluard on a similar tour in 1935. Upon returning to Paris, Soupault composed a poem titled "To Prague" [<i>A Prague</i>] which includes a few locations from "Zone," notably "the dear agates of St. Vitus" [<i>les chères agates de St. Vít</i>] in addition the Jewish cemetery and the "clock of memory" [<i>le cimetière juif et l'horloge du souvenir</i>].<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  But Soupault's poem goes further than a mere tourist's checklist, and testifies to the lasting impression that his new Czech friends made upon him: "You must still offer your hand to me/from time to time. . . .when you listen to the wind/ that comes from the West /and from Paris"[ Il faut encore me tendre la main/ de temps en temps. . . quand vous écoutez le vent/qui vient de l'ouest/et de Paris].<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In reply to this poetic invitation, Nezval dedicated a poem to Soupault that JiříVoskovec translated into French: </p>

<p class="continued">Both poems were published in the inaugural issue of the <i>Revue Devětsil</i>  in a gesture of amity and exchange between Prague and Paris that would characterize the international mission of the review over the course of its four-year existence. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The importance of the poem "Zone" for Czech culture, however, was more profound than simply providing common points of reference between the geographies of Paris and Prague. Critics have noted how Apollinaire's poetry and "Zone" in particular helped to transform and redirect the course of Czech poetry away from national themes and traditional forms towards a more cosmopolitan vision.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> When Čapek's translation of the poem was published in 1919, it created a sensation among the Czech avant-garde for its daring juxtaposition of disparate images and cityscapes. As Nezval writes in work <i>Modern poetic trends</i> [<i>Moderní básnické směry</i>], "Apollinaire influenced modern poetry all over the world, and had as great an impact on the Poetists as he did on the Surrealists . . . [He] brings concepts from religion, mythology, and the fairy tale, and combines them with images from the modern street of a great city. His poems often give the impression of a dream."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  In fact, the French poet's fame in Czechoslovakia even eclipsed his reputation in his home country: Milan Kundera, Seifert and Nezval regarded him as the most important and influential poet in modern European poetry.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> </p>

<p>To appreciate the excitement and enthusiasm with which "Zone" was received, it is instructive to turn to Karel Teige, a founding member of Devětsil and the theoretician of Poetism. On the tenth anniversary of Apollinaire's death , Teige writes: "From the start, with the first verses of 'Zone' we stand in a completely new poetic world: it is an unintelligible, lyrical, and dramatic universe." He describes the poem as "fragmentary, loud and urgent, roaring with European express trains, the clamor of car horns, sirens, advertisements in fireworks" and crackling with imagery that is both discordant and dazzling, over which presides the tower: "the Eiffelka, the tower of pleasure and love, the tower of optimism and power, the flock of bridges, cars and aviation hangers, the colors of all cities, ports, and sunny beaches; this drunken, galloping film imprints rapid and dazzling images upon the screen of the reader's perception."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> This was the Eiffel Tower as Teige saw it through the dazzling images of Apollinaire's poem. Teige, Seifert, Nezval, and others were similarly inspired to create their own images of the tower in photography, poetry, and theater. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Eiffelka
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>As the Czech Paris guidebook entry attests, the Eiffel Tower was initially perceived as daunting, even monstrous. Reaching a height of 320 meters, including the antenna, it was the tallest structure in the world until the Empire State Building displaced it in 1930.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  But tower's iron skeleton, which found resonance in constructivism and the machine age, was also graceful and airy. The leftover plaything of the International Paris Exposition of 1889, it had something of the excitement of a circus attraction, inspiring visitors with wonder and vertigo. Roland Barthes hails the tower as "[the] symbol of modernity, of communication, of science or of the nineteenth century, rocket, stem, derrick, phallus, lighting rod or insect, confronting the great itineraries of our dreams, it is the inevitable sign."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> Apollinaire's invocation of the Eiffel Tower as an emblem of simultaneity is apt, for although it was ostensibly useless when it was first constructed, 

<b></b>

the tower came to occupy a central role in the standardization of time. Its broadcast signal extended progressively outward in concentric circles, first encompassing Paris , then the entire country , until it reached a world wide audience on July 1, 1913.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  News transmissions were first broadcast in 1922,<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  coincidentally the same year that Teige first visited Paris for a month from June 18<sup>th</sup> to July 12<sup>th</sup> .<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Marjorie Perloff recounts how the Eiffel Tower provoked much consternation among Parisians at the turn of the century because it violated entrenched oppositions between art and industry, the high art of museums and the low art of popular entertainment.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  At the same time, it was precisely these paradoxical qualities of the tower that attracted Teige's admiration. In his memoirs, Seifert recounts a trip he took with Teige to Paris, and remarks that his friend would pass the Louvre, full of contempt, and yet would spend hours at outdoor cafes, or visiting curiosities such as circuses and wax museums.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  After returning from Paris in 1922, Teige and Jaromír Krejcar co-edited a volume devoted to modern art titled <i>Život II</i> in which a new, metropolitan aesthetic that would become Poetism was already emerging. In one unattributed commentary in this volume, the Eiffel Tower is compared to the Tatlin's model for the Third International [<a href="#2">re 2</a>], which was intended to be one-third higher than the French monument:<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The Eiffel Tower in Paris is a daringly constructed work, erected for the world's fair and intended to serve as a lookout tower. As form of entertainment, it certainly fulfills its task. On the whole it is beautiful, if we overlook the bad taste of certain details of the time. But why is Tatlin constructing a monument to the Third International, with its various office halls in the form of a tower? It is blind imitation in the fever of mechanistic élan that senselessly transplants certain contrivances where they are not appropriate or suitable.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Although the tower is praised as a "form of entertainment" and a "lookout tower," it does not seem to be the ideal merging of form and function, especially given that the description fails to mention the one practical use of the tower as a radio transmitter. Nonetheless, Tatlin is criticized for installing offices "where they are not appropriate or suitable" and the charm and beauty of the Eiffel Tower is preferred over the contrived, bureaucratic "machine-like" élan of the Third International. While Teige admired aspects of Constructivism, the contrast between the two monuments already indicates that Czech Poetism would contain impulses that could not be fully realized within a strictly Constructivist program. </p>

<p>Poetism bears some resemblance to Dadaism in its rejection of institutional art, to Futurism in its negation of the distinction between art and life, and to Russian Constructivism in its socialist utopian ideals, but the dominant theme of Teige's 1924 Poetism manifesto is its unabashed celebration of the spontaneity of urban life.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>This new art will not find a home in cathedrals or galleries, but outside, in the streets, in the architecture of cities, in the refreshing greenery of parks, in the bustle of seaports . . . It does not work according to self–prescribed formalist recipes: modern shapes and forms that are the outcome of purposeful work; they are being turned out to perfection under the compulsion of purpose and economy. It has embraced the calculations of the engineer and saturated them with poetic vision.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

 </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">
The tower embodies the intersection between poetry and engineering, and belongs to a fanciful vision of the world in which the division between art and life is abolished. In another essay dating from the same year, Teige describes a "lunapark," which contains echoes of the Paris Exposition of 1889, as well as the Prague Jubilee Exhibition of 1891:</p>

<p>The task of modern art, the task of Poetism, is to construct a huge lunapark; to set up grandoise entertainment centers—a marvelous magic city—right in the middle of modern cities, cities of work and production; to create a magic city of Poetism, quite different from similar enterprises of the old world precisely because of its new spirit. A magic city that would simply be the seat of scores of entertaining pranks and misdemeanors; of joy, crazy movements, of surprises of sensations; of the audacity and skill of actors and machines; of the joy at the sight of actions and attractions.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> </p>

<p class="continued">Both the Eiffel Tower and the Petřín Tower fulfill Teige's requirements for an art that is public, urban, and unencumbered by "the compulsion of purpose and economy." The Eiffel Tower proved to be a favored theme in the Czech avant-garde because it embodies the reconciliation of two competing impulses in Poetism: the Constructivist aesthetic of technology and engineering, and a more lyrical sensibility.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>   </p>

<p>For the Poetists, challenging conventional definitions of art included experimenting with the relationship between word and image; Mallarmé's poetry, Marinetti's "Les mots en liberté," Dadaist manifestos, and Apollinaire's <i>Calligrammes </i>were influential precursors

in this respect. When Marinetti traveled to Prague in 1921 to see a production of his play <i>The Fiery Drum</i> at the National Theater, <sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  he gave an animated reading in Teige's apartment which greatly impressed the assembled guests.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> "Les mots en liberté" was published in Czech translation the same year that Nezval wrote the first Czech absurdist play, <i>Dispatch on Wheels</i> [<i>Depeše na kolečkách</i>].

<p class="continued">Whatever function the tower serves in its capacity as a radio transmitter is suddenly subordinated to the flirtations of young lovers and breathtaking views of the city of lights. Another character interjects at apparently random intervals to proclaim "Eiffelka!" over a megaphone; these outbursts have an amusing graphic representation [<a href="#3">re 3</a>], recalling the typographical antics of Marinetti's manifestos and Apollinaire's picture poems in <i>Calligrammes</i>:<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup> </p>

<p>Seifert evokes the Eiffel Tower and the T.S.F. in his collection of poems <i>On the waves of the wireless </i>[<i>Na vlnách T.S.F.</i>], with typography by Teige, which opens with a poem dedicated to Apollinaire: "I remembered you, poet/how you went by years ago and with a smile, and said: Shepherd Eiffel"[<i>na Vás jsem přece vzpomínal básníku/jak šel jste před lety kolem a s úsměvem řekl: Pastýřko Eifelko</i>].<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  In a gesture that parallels Apollinaire's visit to Prague, Seifert sees the sights of Paris—the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre— through the enchanted lens of Apollinaire's life and poetry. The poet's ghostly presence leads him onward through Parisian streets: "I will see your head in white bandages before my eyes forever . . . darkness closes my Guide to Paris before me/an Aeolian harp is the Eiffel Tower/Hear the wind of history and beauty/filling the sails of art o dead helmsman" [<i>Vaši hlavu v bílých obvazech vidím před očima věčně. . . tma zavírá přede mnou Průvodce po Paříži /eolovou harfu je Eifelka/slyš vítr událostí a krásy/nadouvá plachty umění/Ó mrtvý kormidelníku</i>].

<p>Perhaps the most visually dramatic representation of the Eiffel Tower was achieved through the collaboration of Nezval, Teige, and the dancer Milča Mayerová in <i>Alphabet </i>[<i>Abeceda</i>]. Composed the same year that he wrote <i>Dispatch on Wheels, </i>Nezval pushes the limits of language, sound and signification in yet another direction in <i>Alphabet</i> by devoting a short onomatopoetic verse to each letter. In this case, it was Rimbaud's Symbolist poem "Voyelles" that provided the initial inspiration.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Nezval expanded upon his original work in 1926 when he combined photographs of Mayerová in various poses with Teige's unique typography. Each letter celebrates some aspect of modern life: telephones and travel, cowboys and circus tricks, acrobats and engineers, comets and equations create a playful riot of Poetist images. For the letter "Z, " a photo of Mayerová imitating the stance of the Eiffel Tower is paired with Nezval's text [<a href="#4">re 4</a>]: "Farewell then it's time to say adieu/Remember the tenth muse Zany fops/This final hour/Must all partings leave their mark? Well they do/Let's zig-zag up the Eiffel Tower!"[na rozloučenou Nuž tedy sbohem již/Desáté musy vzpomeneš Zubatých gigrlat Střelce/Každé loučení má zuby? Nu ano však ty víš/Zubatá dráho vzhůru po Eifelce!]<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> </p>

<p>Teige's Poetism manifesto anticipates and prepares the way for the experimental combination of photography and typography found in <i>Alphabet</i> by drawing attention to film and photography as the most appropriate media to represent modern life:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>We have set out to explore the possibilities not capable of being satisfied by paintings and poems –in film, circus, sport, tourism and life itself. And so poetism gave birth to visual poems, poetic puzzles and anecdotes, to lyrical films. The authors of these experiments—Nezval, Seifert, Voskovec, and, with your permission, Teige as well—wish to savor all the fruits of poetry, cut loose from a literature destined for the scrap heap, a poetry of <b></b> Sunday afternoons, picnics, luminous cafes, intoxicating cocktails, lively boulevards, spa promenades, but also the poetry of silence, night, quiet and peace.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Deliberately avoiding conventionally enshrined forms of art, the Poetists poured their energy into unrealized film scripts, poetry, and a unique artwork called the picture-poem [<i>obrazová báseˇn</i>] which were ephemeral creations intended for mass reproduction and circulation in newsprint. Teige sought to unite typography and pictures in a form of "optical poetry," which was a collage consisting of photos, tickets, stamps, and other miscellaneous items. International travel, cities, personal souvenirs and occasionally film stars—Charlie Chaplin, for instance—were common subjects: one of his own compositions, titled "Greetings from the journey,"  includes a letter that he sent to Seifert from France. The Brno-based review <i>Pásmo</i> , which means "Zone" in yet another reference to Apollinaire, contains a number of these compositions.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Scanning the image from left to right, we see "goodnight" spelled out in Czech, French and English, which already suggests international travel and communication. Letters are aligned both vertically and horizontally, such that "bonne nuit" is also part of the letter "T" in T.S.F., alluding to the power of radio to unite distant locations in a simultaneous network. These initials, in turn, are superimposed over a map of the Bois de Bologne park in Paris. Smaller blocks of text read "hotel" and "wagons-lits" to signify the romance of travel, while the word "night" evokes neon signs and the power of electric light to keep cities humming with activity day and night. Illuminated skyscrapers, the Milky Way, and the face of the moon frame the dominant image of a map of Europe. From here, the outline of the continent gradually darkens, bleeding into the form of the Eiffel Tower. A picture of a girl in the lower right corner, her head coyly reclining on a pillow, suggests that perhaps these visions are her dream. Through its combination of words and images, Voskovec 's composition offers the viewer a cosmopolitan perspective of Europe that is linked through the re of the Eiffel Tower, the nexus of international communication.  </p>

<p>If Paris was the mirror of Europe, the Czech avant-garde sought its own reflection there: the Eiffelka and Apollinaire's poetry were part of a shared discourse with their counterparts in Paris that was affirmed in their art works and avant-garde journals through common points of reference, friendships, and creative exchanges. Teige, Seifert and Nezval spent time in Paris in the 1920s, and followed Parisian artistic movements closely as they developed their own variations and inventions. Parisians, in turn, could read French translations of Seifert and Nezval in <i>La Revue Française de Prague</i>, released simultaneously in Prague and Paris, and in the Parisian journal <i>Le Grand Jeu</i>.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Cultural exchanges between Prague and Paris continued to flourish through the Surrealist movement, largely thanks to the efforts of Nezval, who met André Breton in Paris in 1933. Nezval was Breton's ardent advocate in Prague, arranging for translations of his works and promoting his manifestos. In 1935, Breton and Eluard came to Prague and met with Nezval, Štyrský, and Toyen in an effort to promote Surrealism as an international phenomenon. By 1938, however, these alliances began to falter; under pressure from the Communist Party, Nezval abruptly abandons the French Surrealists, much to Breton's dismay.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup> But the decisive blow that severed the bonds between Paris and Prague was the Munich Agreement, when Czechoslovakia was infamously ceded to Hitler— proof that Europe was not as united as the Czechs had hoped.  </p>

<p>To mark this betrayal, Soupault revised his Prague poem of 1927, renamed it "Ode à Prague" in 1946, and published it in a collection of poems dedicated to different cities including New York, Paris, and London.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  A few of the verses are identical to the original, but the atmosphere of the poem is entirely altered by the circumstances of the war:  </p>

The shattered relations between the two cities is also recorded in Vladimír Holan's bitter poem, "Answer to Paris" [<i>Odpověd' Francii</i>] : "Enough Paris! Not another step in your maddening parks/where I once waited for the night to bring suffering/ . . . /Meanwhile implacable hours /Strike on the Spasskaya Tower."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  His prediction was cruel but accurate when Czechoslovakia fell under the shadow of the Kremlin's Spasskaya Tower, a synecdoche for the USSR, from 1948 until the Velvet Revolution. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Communist regime suppressed French culture after the war,<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup> Apollinaire's Paris retained a powerful resonance for the members of the avant-garde who lived through the heroic period of the First Republic. Czech editions of Apollinaire's works were initially scarce, but interest in the poet increased in the late 1950s and early 60s. In 1958, on the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Apollinaire's death, Milan Kundera

and Adolf Kroupa published <i>Zone and other poems</i> [<i>„Pásmo" a jiné verše</i>] with an introduction by Nezval. Exhibits dedicated to Apollinaire were organized in 1960 and 1961, and Michel Décaudin, who would become the editor of the Pléiade edition of his works, participated in a conference on the poet in Prague in 1964. A monograph was published in 1964, and new Czech editions of Apollinaire's works appeared in 1966.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  In the midst of this Apollinaire revival, which coincided with the beginnings of Prague Spring and increased freedom of expression, Seifert nostalgically reflects on the subject that had enchanted and inspired him in his youth in "Café Slavia" from his 1967 collection of poems, <i>Halley's Comet</i>: </p>

The tower, which is gendered female, is standing in the same position that Mayerová struck for the illustration of the letter Z for Nezval's <i>Alphabet</i>: with her feet planted apart, she extends her arms over her head joins them in a solid fist to imitate the tower's peak. At first glance, Seifert's invocation of the Seine and the Eiffel Tower seems to be an apt metaphor for his nostalgia for the café culture of the 1920s. But a present-day visitor to the Café Slavia in Prague, which to this day stands on the right bank of the Vltava across from the National Theater, will make a startling discovery: the Eiffel Tower <i>is </i>just outside the window—in the form of the Petřín Tower, its petite cousin.  </p>

Although I will not present a complete history of the Czech avant-garde here, some brief explanation is necessary to track the various names and movements associated with artistic activity in the 1920s and 30s. Devětsil, a term that means both "nine forces" and refers to the butterbur flower, was an artistic group founded in Prague Oct. 5<sup>th</sup> 1920 that included Vladislav Vančura, Vítězslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert, Jindřich Štyrský, Toyen, and Josef Šíma. Initially the group championed proletarian literature and was socialist in its political orientation. In 1924, Karel Teige launched a new movement called Poetism, which included Nezval, Seifert, and Konstantin Biebl. In 1933, Nezval struck out in yet another direction when he organized a group of Czech Surrealists inspired by the French model.

<p><a name="FOOT20" href="#REF20">20</a>. French, Czech, and American critics have commented upon how cultural politics and nationalism play a role in the reception and interpretation of Čapek's translation of "Zone." French critic Vladimir Brett writes that Čapek "probably didn't have a thorough grasp of French" [<i>ne connaissait pas probablement à fond le français</i>] and made a few odd translations . But Deborah Garfinkle convincingly argues that these mistakes were not accidental at all, and served a specific national purpose. She quotes Čapek, who explains the motivation behind his translation in the introduction to a 1936 edition of the poem: "['Zone'] originated under the pressure of war as a literary expression of solidarity and spiritual allegiance with the nation which at the time shed its blood at Verdun for the cause that was also the cause of our hearts and fate" (qtd in Garfinkle, 361). Thus, for the Czechs, Garfinkle argues that the poem "represented the spiritual covenant between [Czechoslovakia] and France. They recognized that Apollinaire's affinity for their capital could rescue them from the provincial obscurity they had suffered under the Habsburgs" . See Deborah Garfinkle,"Karel Čapek's Pásmo and the Construction of Literary Modernity," <i>Slavic and East European Journal</i> vol. 47, no 3  345–366 and Vladimir Brett, "Apollinaire et les Tchèques," <i>Du monde européen à l'univers des mythes.

Michael Henry Heim (London: Macmillian Press, 1994), 258. Using clues from "Le passant de Prague," particularly the heraldic signs over doors, Czech critic Vladimír Diviš identifies a few of the specific streets that he believes Apollinaire took in his wanderings through the Old Town, including Rybná, Benediktská, and Jilská. From there, Diviš speculates that Apollinaire went to see the astronomical clock in the Old Town Square, walked around the Jewish quarter and saw the Old-New Synagogue (where the famous clock that runs backwards is located), proceeded to Charles Bridge, and then walked up Nerudova street to the castle and the cathedral. Štyrský claimed that Apollinaire carved his name on one of the towers flanking Charles Bridge on the Malá Strana side, but no one has been able to substantiate this rumor. Diviš gently takes Apollinaire to task for his factual errors—for instance, the famous chapel of Wenceslas is encrusted with amethysts, not agates—but this ultimately does not diminish the French poet's reputation in his view.

<p><a name="FOOT25" href="#REF25">25</a>. In the nineteenth century, Czech poetry was predominantly nationalist to counter the cultural dominance of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This began to change as the poetry of Verlaine, Baudelaire, and Mallarmé appeared in Czech translation around the turn of the century. But the most influential of these poets was Apollinaire. His poem "Zone" inspired both the form and content of a number of poems in the 1920s, including: "Svatý Kopeček" Jiří Wolker, "Nový Ikarus" and "Generace" by Konstantin Biebl, and "Edison" by Nezval.

<p><a name="FOOT38" href="#REF38">38</a>. In his Poetism manifesto, Teige promoted an art that would not be confined to museums, but would come alive in the streets. Furthermore, he wanted to eliminate the distinction between artists and everyone else, arguing that anyone could participate in Poetism. In this respect, Poetism follows the pattern of other avant-garde movements : "[W]ith the historical avant-garde movements, the social subsystem that is art enters the stage of self-criticism . . . Dadaism, the most radical movement within the European avant-garde, no longer criticizes schools that preceded it, but criticizes art as an institution, and the course its development took in bourgeois society . . . The avant-garde protest, whose aim it is to reintegrate art into the praxis of life, reveals the nexus between autonomy and the absence of any consequences."

<p id="lead">The odds were stacked against surrealism in Germany after May 1945. Immediately after the armistice, obituaries counted it as another avant-garde fatality. Dieter Wyss, for example, insisted in his surrealism primer from 1949/1950 that the 1947 Parisian surrealism retrospective confirmed his suspicions that "surrealism is practically dead, at least in its homeland." "This is not surprising," he continued, "for it anticipated what became horrifically real between the years 1933 to 1945."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Whether and when surrealism died remains uncertain. Did it expire in France with its political turn around 1929, the German invasion of Western Europe in 1939, Breton's American exile in 1940, the end of the war and the surrealist revival in Paris in 1945, or Breton's death in 1966? Posed solely within the German context, the question assumes entirely different dimensions. Did surrealism ever establish itself firmly enough in Germany before National Socialism eradicated so-called "degenerate art" such that a postwar appearance could be called a return? Was the negligible interest in surrealism in postwar Germany the result of a second failed attempt to transplant foreign goods onto German soil? Was surrealism, over twenty years old, dead on arrival? In 1956, Theodor Adorno answered the last of these questions in the affirmative: "After the European catastrophe," he insisted, "the Surrealist shocks lost their force."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Adorno's emphasis on the mitigated shocks of surrealism suggested that, in the shadow of Auschwitz, surrealism became unable to trump the dialectic of enlightenment. </p>

<p>Surrealist literature did germinate, however, in war-torn Germany. In poems written in Nazi Germany, Karl Krolow employed surrealist metaphor, which continued well after his 

<b></b>

first postwar collection, <i>Gedichte</i> from 1948. In September 1947 at the first meeting of what would become West Germany's leading literary salon, <i>Gruppe 47</i>, hostess Ilse Schneider-Lengyel was invited to read "her surrealist poems and with them introduced a peculiar element into the working group."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Alfred Andersch declared at the group's second meeting that surrealism (among other aesthetic approaches) had already proven capable, albeit with varying degrees of success, of paving the way for a renewed German literature intimately committed to freedom.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  One year later, Berlin poet Johannes Hübner took stock of surrealism and concluded that it adequately captured the paradoxes at work in the concept of the beautiful in the atomic age.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In spite of these early attempts to rehabilitate it, the surrealist impulse, unspeakably too "peculiar" for German readers and writers, failed to take root in West Germany.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Some critics even lambasted it as a "curse of morbid decadence."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The solitary pursuit of surrealism in the fifties garnered, unsurprisingly, confusion and even rejection. Paul Celan, Unica Zürn, and Peter Weiss, three now canonized German writers, are exceptional cases among young West Germany's coterie of surrealists. While their work explored markedly different forms and themes, their interest in surrealism developed in response to surviving Germany's hellish past. Neither borne out of nostalgia for the interwar avant-garde nor grounded in an ideology of postwar cultural renewal, their surrealisms grew out of personal experiences of being elsewhere, as an exile, an émigré, or somewhere in between. For all three, the specters of violence from the fascist past not only shaped their individual sense of displacement but also brought them to modify surrealism in order to give voice to the realities of this interminable condition after war and genocide. If, according to Edward Said, literature plays a pivotal role in the exile's quest to "overcome . . . the crippling sorrow of estrangement," surrealism enabled these writers to illuminate the brokenness endemic to the exilic experience.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For the German-Jewish Weiss, the brokenness of exile persisted as a central theme in his work and his personal life well after 1945. Weiss makes clear that the circumstances responsible for his unending sense of estrangement originated in 1938 with his flight from fascism, which landed him in Sweden the following year. In an interview from 1979, he remarked, "the 50s were in large part more exilic for me than the years during fascism." This was because Germany had failed after the armistice, geo-political division, and a hasty economic reconstruction to resemble the place he had once called home.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  With respect to Weiss's fascination with surrealism, scholarship has focused on measuring its authenticity vis-à-vis French forerunners and assessing its relevance in his early Swedish painting and literature (1940–1947) as well as his final magnum opus, <i>The Aesthetics of Resistance</i> (1975–1981).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  His short novel that took West Germany by storm—<i>The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman</i> written in 1952—has garnered, however, negligible attention from scholars of Weiss's surrealism.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This omission is perplexing given that 1952 marks the beginning of Weiss's avant-garde film career and his shift from painting to collage; the influence of surrealists Luis Buñuel and Max Ernst on these less well-known works is unmistakable. Situating the novel with respect to Weiss's visual turn to the surreal is crucial, for its links to and departures from the surrealist idiom expose not only the relevance of surrealism for coping with the effects 

<b></b>

of exile but also the necessary post-fascist transformations of surrealism required to articulate this condition. Appraising the complementarity and tensions between Weiss's media must begin by questioning Weiss's own misleading assertion that his literary debut was just a linguistic exercise meant to facilitate the re-acquisition of German after years of writing and speaking Swedish.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Much more than a mere linguistic exercise, <i>The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman</i> illustrates the material body's centrality in the experience of exile and points toward an alternative to the unfulfillable desire to mend this broken body. According to Weiss's surrealist economy of representation, language exacerbates this corporeal crisis, which only the visual can adequately avoid. Weiss's engagement with surrealism illustrates the historically contingent realignment of the relationality between the avant-garde and realism that prevailed among those few who brought what was once radical modernism to bear on the postwar specters of fascist violence. </p>

Exile and the Body Torn Asunder

<p>Initially rejected and then eight years later accepted for publication, Weiss's widely acclaimed and, in its time, shockingly unique "micro-novel" was originally printed in a limited pressing. Comprised of eleven loosely connected vignettes and seven collages, the work has been characterized as a veiled account of Weiss's austere exilic existence in rural Sweden. One of eleven guests in a remote country boarding house, the nameless first-person protagonist—the narrative eye of the text—mentions neither deportation nor expatriation as having shaped his or the fates of the novel's other characters. However, his meticulous observations of three days of eccentric events in and around the house make clear that this is not the boarders' home. Not until the arrival of the coachman toward the book's close does the severity of their isolation from the outside world come into view. The message the coachman's body bears is anticipated in the visual reconnaissance with which the novel begins. </p>

<p>In the first vignette, the narrator surveys visually the terrain surrounding the boarding house's privy. "Through the half-open door I see the muddy, trampled path and the rotten planks around the pigsty."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  With little to see, he resorts to acoustically scanning his environs: snorting pigs, the wind, crows, dripping rainwater, a saw, and a man humming. He then emerges from the privy and confirms visually the spatial relationships only partially imaginable aurally. The spatial orientation of the self and the constitution of its identity assume primary importance. Inside a box with a narrow aperture, a camera obscura of sorts, the narrator—his task on the toilet is that of "concentration" and "observation"—establishes a teleology between "I see," "I hear," and "I can imagine." This shift allows him to assemble the outside world out of perceived parts. His vantage point brings him to declare in the second vignette, "I am now located . . . ."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This slippage between epistemological wholeness and ontological certitude at the novel's opening is not as stable as it might seem. Of the eleven other bodies the narrator sees, he perceives none as being whole in spite of his thoroughness. Mr. Schnee, a fellow boarder, is evoked at first solely in terms of his hands. Heightening 

<b></b>

this fragmentation, the protagonist sees Mr. Schnee's face framed in a windowpane. The narrator then encounters a tailor whose corporeal fragmentation is intimated by his clothes, stitched together entirely out of scraps. Through another window, he also witnesses a tableau vivant in the young family's apartment. The narrator captures not only the room's contours but also the spatial relationship of their bodies fixed within space: the mother's breast vis-à-vis the infant's mouth, the agitated father's fist, face, and mouth vis-à-vis the son's chin, shoulders, and ears. The family's bodies are never evoked as being whole. Phenomenally, the narrator segments their bodies and frames select parts for exhaustive inspection. This metonymic displacement of the whole to its parts is anything but arbitrary. Concentration on the family's organs, limbs, and orifices draws attention to those somatic sites with the greatest symbolic potency in the family's Oedipal conflict and thus conveys an illusory sense of symbolic wholeness where materially there is none. </p>

<p>The narrator's underlying desire to "give an outline to what I've seen" hardly comes to fruition from this metonymic attention to body parts (C, 18). His fixation on limbs, their features, and exact movements prevails throughout. In his most severe protocols, he erases the subject entirely and implies that limbs are fully automated and independent. The meal in the fourth vignette includes a handful of salient passages that exemplify this shift: "Hands holding spoons are now lifted toward the pots from all sides . . . "; "the mouths open"; "the tin mugs are occasionally grabbed by the other hands"; and " . . . the liquid penetrates into the mouths" (C, 8–9). This fervor to document every microscopic detail accomplishes the exact opposite of omniscience. Body fragmentation assumes its most literal manifestation outside the realm of perception, in the person of the doctor. Incorrectly described as a "whole body," the doctor is actually an assemblage whose individual parts are sutured together by stitches and bandages from head to legs (C, 8). He later implies in a litany of whispered sentence fragments that he has performed nothing less than a vivisection on himself. The numerous invasive incisions, lacerations, biopsies, and drainages he has undertaken—all brought about because of a mysterious and enduring pain he wishes to excise surgically—result in total disorientation: "arm all slashed, lose direction, lose the door, the table, wrong door, don't know upstairs, downstairs, up or down, sit in the dark, don't know arm or leg, pain the same . . . " (C, 22). In this vertiginous state, he removes his black sunglasses to reveal his "empty, whitish" eyes and concludes that there is "nothing more to see, even the strongest light, all in the dark" (C, 22). The doctor's body occupies a crucial position in the novel's corporeal economy, for it illustrates a radical divide between feelings of pain (whose origins are as nebulous as those of the boarders), the corporeal fragmentation it generates, and the ability to perceive these symptoms with the naked eye. </p>

<p>The doctor's self-mutilated body sheds light on the narrator's own complicated relationship to his own body. Whereas the doctor suffers from debilitating pain that severs, disorients, and blinds, the narrator is committed to the exact opposite: assembling, orienting, and seeing. Unlike the other boarders, he perceives a path away from what he calls the "new, short, and broken-off" and toward a position of sustained clarity and wholeness (C, 6). His one-point perspective is a quest for power over the 

<b></b>

subjects in his line of vision; while their bodies fail to heed his phenomenal pursuit of wholeness, his body initially seems intact, a whole body subsumed by authority of the "I" that accordingly disappears behind the eye. In contradistinction to his ability to perceive other bodies in pieces, he is repeatedly unable to document his own body parts' minute actions. "I, I hardly notice how I eat," he admits during the meal with the other boarders (C, 10). This looking beyond the self such that the lived body disappears from view follows normative patterns of perceptual embodiment. According to philosopher Drew Leder, "The body conceals itself precisely in the act of revealing what is Other."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Although the narrator refrains from engaging in the doctor's self-mutilation, his being-in-the-world is not as exceptional as it first seems. In spite of his conviction that he is an intact subject fixed in time and space and devoid of the phenomenal dissociation, metonymic condensation, or surgical segmentation of the other body-objects, his body also succumbs to fragmentation. As is the case with the other boarders, his limbs revolt against his absent whole self such that they, too, become the motor that propels him through time and space. This first occurs in vignette two with his passage from the outhouse to his attic room: "my hands pulled me, and my feet under which the steps were creaking pushed me higher and higher . . . " (C, 5). The ascendancy of the narrator's body parts occurs at exactly that moment when he surveys his environment while in motion. Drifting through the kitchen, he remarks how its objects glided by [<i>vorüberglitten</i>] him. Gliding [<i>gleiten</i>], phenomenologist Erwin Straus asserts, can be pleasurable, for it affords one the sense overcoming space. It also frightens, for it not only prevents the perceiving individual from differentiating space into discrete units but also continually "threaten[s] to become falling."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Gliding does not only preempt one's ability to perceive and therefore know one's self in the world, but it also modifies their relationship insofar as the body is perceived as belonging "to both 'bodily space' and 'external space.'"<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The narrator's pulling hands and pushing feet signal a shift whereby his body, which was otherwise an absent whole, becomes visible as a few select parts that join the object realm of other automated limbs. No longer an exclusive subject, he becomes aware of his own corporeal instability precisely because he is gliding. Motion deprives him of his mastery such that his body is perceived as being asunder from itself.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  This fall from totality lasts momentarily, for the narrator restricts his movements during his three-day chronicle to an absolute minimum; his corporeal wholeness is largely contingent upon remaining still. Returning to the narrator's inversely proportional relationship with the doctor, the body for both of them is a point of departure for perceiving the world. Unlike the doctor, whose pain has brought about a blindness that prevents him from experiencing anything beyond his own disred body, the narrator's distance from the events and bodies he observes aids and abets his quest to perceive an intact world from his insides out. With respect to the overriding question of estrangement, the micro-novel's mysteriously displaced narrator exhibits with his ocular obsession both a self-awareness of the displaced body's lost wholeness and a pursuit to recover it. He ignores entirely the relevance of the doctor's afflictions for his own unstable condition.

From Visions to Shadows: The Quest for Wholeness
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The instability of the narrator's body and his mania for descriptions of other bodies point toward to an overriding phenomenal and corporeal economy in the text, a flow that continually pushes from part to whole. The desire to make a whole body out of its parts is most forcefully underscored in vignette three when the narrator is alone in his room and dedicates himself to the art of "Erdenken von Bildern," literally the conceiving of images (K, 18).<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  It is here where surrealist ways of seeing intrude into the phenomenological obsessions of Weiss's narrator. "For this," he reports, "I lie stretched out on the bed; within reach, beside me, on the table, there is a plate full of salt from which I occasionally take a few grains to put in my eyes. The function of the salt is to stimulate the tear glands and thus blur my vision" (C, 7). Far from merely blurring his vision, his experiments in altered perception dissolve the narrator's spatial confines entirely and conjure up illusions of unmitigated wholeness: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>directly below me . . . there gleamed a face as if in moonlight, yet there was no moon nor any stars, a face with thin cheekbones, a full, dark mouth, dark shaded eyes, and under the face a slim throat against the flowing hair, and under the edge of the throat the sharply outlined collar bone with the bare straight shoulders, and under the shoulders the bare breasts circumscribed by lines of shadows, with the black centers of the nipples, and under the breasts the ribs . . .</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(C, 7).
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">After seeing this apparition, the narrator admits that he "felt her nearness so strongly" that he "took the mirage for reality and made a hasty movement with [his] arms which immediately tore the image" (C, 7). Something deeply desired, this whole woman is a construct, a whole body carefully sutured together piece by piece, a metonymic string of signifiers that begins with the head and arrives at closure with the toe. Several scholars like Otto Best have insisted that this first of several visions is nothing less than the narrator's exploration of surrealist techniques for augmenting perception. Where Best describes this as the visual equivalent of surrealism's <i>écriture automatique</i>, others chalk the experiments up to the narrator's flight from reality, his escape into the dream, and a path towards wish fulfillment by the unconscious.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Indeed, the narrator's use of salt does evoke surrealism's pharmacokinetic methods for inducing what Walter Benjamin called "profane illumination," intoxications of thought to which hallucinogenic drugs could provide an "introductory lesson." Crucial differences exist, however, between the narrator's salt and Benjamin's hashish, the most salient of which being salt's inability to rupture psychochemically the rigid borders between "dreaming and waking states."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Compared to one of André Breton's trance-like experiences in which he perceived "a man walking cut half way up by a window perpendicular to the axis of his body," Weiss's narrator employs salt to accomplish the exact opposite.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Instead of closing his eyes and activating the realm of the unconscious to disclose a forbidden world of fantastic and random assemblages, he achieves with eyes wide open what he otherwise cannot: capturing the spectacle of a whole body. </p>

<p>Compared to his Sisyphean task of assembling quotidian reality into a whole, these solitary salt experiments are hardly a triumph. This failure to make "seeing into an occupation"

<b></b>

 comes to light in the novel's collages (C, 18). Ignored by scholars until very recently, the collages, which Weiss created five years after completing the text, exist in a twilight space between the ocularcentrism within the text and an extra-textual realm of images.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  If images, as Weiss would later declare in his cosmology of language, simultaneously convey all their components as a single totality, then the grid-like collages juxtaposed with particular narrative scenes announce that the totality seen is actually a collection of fragments.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Totality, like absolute transparency, is a fiction. In the lower left-hand corner of the first collage [<a href="#1">re 1</a>], just one page after the description of the apparition of a woman, a man in profile gazes through an optical device. By virtue of the other two related images positioned in his line of sight in the collage's far-right column, it is suggested that both apparatuses unveil what otherwise eludes the eye. As suggested by the prism in the lower right-hand corner and a camera lucida above it, both optical aids expose the individual elements that comprise larger natural phenomena (i.e., the dispersal of light into a spectrum). Like the rigid block grid that determines the relation between the collage's individual parts, these scientific instruments of reason reveal the hidden order in the visible world by unveiling the interdependency between part and whole.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Though the collage invokes the salt experiments from vignette three, it nevertheless questions the wholeness that the narrator takes to be real. The woman recounted in the text as a string of signifiers that begins with her head and face appears in the collage as being decapitated. With her abdomen and headless body positioned at the same implied depth of field (or column) as the prism and light projector, the collage infers the male gaze—unlike the scientific instruments—as being incapable of divining a whole from the sum of a woman's parts. Similarly, her head, although directly in the crosshairs of the male gaze, loses both detail and definition the farther the man's eye penetrates until it finally eclipses the head altogether. As his gaze travels from left to right, he wields a violence that severs the female body such that the remainder is only her <i>res extensa</i>. Unlike the unified whole in the salt vision, he beholds through his looking glass a headless female body, her abdomen singled out in the top-right corner but not yet penetrated by his eye. </p>

<p>This discord between text and collage is crucial, for not only does it make clear that the latter is not a mimetic illustration of the events unfurled in the former, but it also attests to the unresolved intermedial tensions in Weiss's avant-garde output throughout the fifties. With respect to the collage's status as image, it and not the narrator taps as meta-narrative agent into the anatomy lessons of surrealism, the most important of which is the fundamental nature of misrecognition in the identification with images. As Linda Williams points out, Jacques Lacan's linguistic revision of Freudian psychoanalysis—in particular his theory of the mirror stage—encapsulated and expounded upon the very same surrealist concerns about the purity of "nonverbal image-discourse" that culminated in surrealist writings like those of Antonin Artaud. Just as Artaud exposed "the image of the Other" as "a seductive illusion of wholeness," so too did Lacan insist that the narcissistic desire to equate the specular image of the Other with the self was a fiction. This misrecognition arises because the imaginary order in which such identifications transpire systemically deny the <i>a priori</i> presence of the symbolic.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Misrecognition is thus an inherent unawareness of Lacan's proposition that "The unconscious

<b></b>

 is structured like a language."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Once the illusion is eventually smashed, the subject—with only the linguistic structures of the symbolic at its disposal—desires to regain an originary sense of totality by literally stringing signifiers together "word to word and from line to line" into an interminable chain (C, 17). By throwing salt into his eyes, Weiss's narrator not only testifies to the centrality of misrecognition in his "attempts at writing" but also short circuits the nostalgic logic of metonymic desire as if to suggest that metonymy can attain fulfillment once and for all. Although firmly rooted in the visual registers of the prelinguistic imaginary, Weiss's collage counters this misrecognition by rupturing the myth of wholeness. Far from merely repeating surrealism's proto-psychoanalytic exercises, or even reconciling the body in pieces as a normative trans-historical condition, Weiss's collages deploy instances of the imaginary that are situated outside the false perceptions of the narrator in order to establish a basis on which to think through the limited binarism of fragmentation-versus-wholeness. Consumed by his desire to access the imaginary, the narrator fails to recognize at the micro-novel's close the proto-cinematic solution to his dilemma.</p>

<p>First mentioned in vignette two, the coachman of the micro-novel's title is absent until the final vignette. The climax of the novel, the penultimate scene in which the narrator sees shadows of the coachman and the housekeeper engaged in intercourse, 

<b></b>

stands out as the exceptional moment in the narrative in which bodies become whole: "Only the shadow of the raised hand of the housekeeper holding the coffeepot stuck out from the shapeless, condensed joining of the shadows of the bodies. The shadow of the coffeepot swayed back and forth, the shadow of the bodies also swayed back and forth; and now and then the shadow of the heads in profile, sticking close together, rose above the clump of bodies" (C, 37). Frequently interpreted as a spectacle that traumatizes the narrator, the sex scene actually leaves the narrator feeling "absolute[ly] indifferent" (C, 35).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  This indifference, which brings him to consider ending his writerly quest to transcend the "short, broken-off," arises because this "visual game" neither resembles the illusory outcome of his salt-induced visions, nor does it allow for the perpetual quest for wholeness through metonymy (C, 6).<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The shadows of the alien bodies he surveils do not correspond to his own desired specular image; while the bodies' shadows intermittently appear to have appendages, they fuse to form a corporeal mass discernible only as a blob that rocks back and forth. Indivisible and anatomically foreign, the "clump of bodies" exhibits a shadowy mass [<i>Schattenmasse</i>] solely in terms of its optical unity and forestalls any and all identification (K, 88). This is all the more astonishing given that this mere projection of silhouettes is nothing less than a cinematic experience: "I could see [ . . . ] the shadows falling from the kitchen window onto the ground in the yard while I was leaning out of my window inhaling the night air" (C, 37). Reading this rough replication of cinema as a manifestation of the imaginary, as Christian Metz might, is problematic. This screen does not reflect the ego ideal as a mirror does but rather distorts it. Similar to surrealist film in terms of its disruption of identification with the screen, this proto-filmic moment departs from surrealism's disinclination to distort the perceived image.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Ironically, it also contradicts Weiss's own assessment of surrealist film's greatest contribution to avant-garde cinema, which he articulated in 1956 in his study on the history of avant-garde film. Unlike Luis Buñuel's surrealist films that turned "away from the aestheticizing character" of earlier vanguard cinema, which merely played "with light and shadows" and exaggerated photographic "effects and technical finesse," the light show that closes <i>The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman</i> does exactly that.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  As if to suggest that the imaginary signifier must be jettisoned, the play of shadows proposes another sur-reality for identification, one that transcends the fiction of lost wholeness as instantiated by the virtual woman in the salt hallucinations as well as the misrecognition that accompanies her appearance. In place of these visions, the light show infers that the non-totalizing form of embodiment can be rectified by smashing the mirror and, with it, the blueprint for an ideal anatomy. Although the narrator fails to acknowledge the lessons in this accidental film—he leaves his last sentence without any closing punctuation as if to suggest that it must be continued—Weiss made non-totalizing corporeal assemblages comprised of non-contiguous body parts the centerpiece of his first mature avant-garde film.

The (Sur)Realist Solution: The Fragmented Body
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Filmed while he wrote <i>The Shadow of the Body of the Coachman</i>, Weiss's second film, "Studie II (Hallucinationer)" , is comprised of twelve scenes, each of which contains disparate nude male and female body parts that they rock, tilt, walk, wave, grasp, hoist, rotate, and quiver. Filmed with a static camera, each tableau vivant sets a markedly different group of body fragments against a black background. While they evoke in name the salt experiments from the micro-novel, the twelve hallucinations in the film have little in common with the narrator's instrumentalization of a dreamlike state. According to Weiss's own assessment of his film, each mise-en-scène was pieced together to create deformed "res" meant to evoke "strong erotically-tinged feelings" (A, 141).<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  In an interview with Harun Farocki many years later, Weiss insisted that the film's basis was a series of ink sketches of deformed and anatomically disproportionate bodies that "dealt with the exile situation," which he described as "dreamlike" and "traumatic."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Weiss's readings of the film, in which he underscores the themes of desire, deformed bodies, and the trauma of exile, intimates that his development from writer to filmmaker traveled full circle. As in the case of the micro-novel, the film displays Weiss's recurring predicament of bodies torn asunder. Unlike the novel, the film conceives loss as an interminable and irreversible condition. Taking the misrecognition at the micro-novel's close as its point of departure, the film also moves beyond the text's embrace of the imaginary as a visual means to recover linguistically the lost whole body. Assuming the text also represents the effects of trauma on the exilic body along with the drive to master, unsuccessfully, its concomitant fragmentation, the film marks a breakthrough for Weiss insofar as it radically subverts the foregoing object of desire. "Studie II" represents the apogee of Weiss's engagement with the broken body during his exile after exile, because it gives voice to a trauma whose effects his works cannot escape. </p>

<p>The film's first establishing shot [<a href="#2">re 2</a>] establishes vision and desire as the points of departure for the remaining eleven shots. This mise-en-scène is comprised of three distinct body formations, the most prominent being a male torso and head lying face up, its right arm raised in the air with a glass ball in hand. With a pair of legs atop his chest—feet pointed toward his head—the man stares at the ball carefully twirled in his hand. In his line of sight is an arm that protrudes from the right-hand perimeter of the frame, its hand opening and closing slowly. Behind the male's torso on the left hand side of the frame, a nude female in profile gazes into a mirror such that her visage is reflected toward the camera. A self-reflective acknowledgement of the imaginary and the illusion of the specular image, the woman-mirror arrangement echoes itself in the male head/torso-glass ball constellation insofar as both involve a scopic drive. Where the mirror illustrates the illusory constitution of an ego ideal, the glass ball—a perfect form—embodies wholeness <i>a priori</i>. Corporeal unity is made radically other by the glass ball. The proximity of the ball to the arm fragment is significant, for their stereoscopic juxtaposition in the male's line of sight suggests a relation; the ball the man twirls is inversely proportional to the spherical void outlined by the arm's flexing fingers. Called by Weiss the film's "tranquil mode," this shot establishes the falsity of 

<b></b>

the mirror and the absence of corporeal unity; the totality of the glass ball cannot be reproduced by what must remain fragmentary, the body in pieces.</p>

<p>Inferred in the second and third shots, the conceptual trajectory of "Studie II" reaches a plateau with shot four [<a href="#3">re 3</a>], in which four sets of body parts appear independent of one another. Peering downward into the frame, a face looks not at a second face in the opposite corner of the frame. This other face, set back farther into the depth of field, looks above and beyond a pair of hands that protrude from the right side of the frame and cut a herring on a plate with fork and knife. A foot rests on the geographical plane behind the plate. Situated in their own distinct position in the frame's three-dimensional composition, these body parts refrain from interpellating one another. The libidinal vectors from these gazes have no target and the potential objects of desire within the frame go unnoticed and unclaimed. The idea of <i>Unlust</i> that Weiss identified in this constellation must be taken literally as a negation of desire by arresting it with and in space. From the falseness of the initial mirror, "Studie II" progresses to suspend desire altogether and deems fractured embodiment unalterable. </p>

<p>"Studie II" continues with eight more conrations, four of which (numbers five, six, eight, and ten) document the reemergence of desire as an intrusion of the symbolic order into the initial dream of arrested desire. Shot nine, described by Weiss as a ration of "maturity and inner resistance," reiterates the suspension of desire in shots two through four. Shots seven, eleven, and twelve overlap in their preoccupation with sleeping res, the overriding topos of a film whose subtitle announces the coming of dreamlike hallucinations. Particularly striking because of their juxtaposition, shots

eleven and twelve reveal the nature of the screen in Weiss's film. If each individual mise-en-scène represents a dreamlike hallucination, and if the composition and trajectory of all the shots rupture—in the tradition of surrealist film—the illusions of the imaginary signifier such that fulfillment of desire is frozen, are these final shots not also a hallucinatory assault on the desire to sleep? If the dream, as Freud contends, is the fulfillment of the desire to sleep, are these surrealist-like dream-images of sleepers dreaming not a self-effacing move to disrupt the dream, a dream against dreaming? Scene eleven [<a href="#4">re 4</a>], labeled by Weiss a "lullaby," provides an answer. Comprised of two body assemblages, the tableaux depicts an arm protruding downward from the upper perimeter of the frame, the palm of its hand affixed to the left temple of a tightly framed man's head with eyes closed. Together the arm and head gyrate clockwise, while behind them a pair of legs rotates in the opposite direction. Inducing sleep, the title and composition suggest, assumes serene, machine-like rhythms. As with the previous shots, however, the assemblage of body parts must not be construed as a single composite form. The opposing directionality of the leg assemblage vis-à-vis the sleeping torso-arm aggregate makes clear that the sought-after dream of wholeness (which is induced by the fragmented body) cannot mask, let alone reverse, the unrelenting intrusion of bodily fragmentation. Not the cause but rather the symptom of what Lacan calls "something quite primary," the film's automatic limbs once again pit their on-screen dream against the body's desire for wholeness.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In effect, the film functionalizes traumatic symptoms—body parts—in order to approximate surrealist disruptions within the imaginary screen. The culmination of this is the twelfth and final shot [<a href="#5">re 5</a>],

<p class="continued">

the sole mise-en-scène in which just the symptom appears: atop a headless torso lies another legless and headless trunk with its back facing the camera. From underneath the torsos, two legs jut out to the left of the frame and from the bottom edge of the frame an arm rests, its fingers moving ever so slightly atop the torsos. A pile of mostly lifeless body parts, this shot elevates the screen as the exclusive subject of the dream. Described by Weiss as "drowning in loneliness and sleep," it infers this condition of the fragmented body to be a state of finitude. </p>

<p>Like every other tableaux in "Studie II," this final scene derives its affective impact not only from the severed bodies but also the depthlessness of the black background. Like the bodies they envelop, these voids carry meaning, albeit in a register that exceeds the empire of the eye. Lacan contends that just as the image screen conceals the real, it also points towards the real's existence. Along with its scenes of torn bodies—symptoms of lost corporeal wholeness—"Studie II" incorporates the return of the traumatic real as something unassimilable that persists beyond the fragmented body and the frame of representation. In his seminar on the gaze, Lacan speaks of the "stain" as the visible mark through which the traumatic real gazes and blinds the subject. In "Studie II" this stain exists exclusively within the realm of the audible. Performed and recorded by Weiss, the film's soundtrack is his first "experiment with the possibilities of a new acoustic world . . . of screeching, scratching, and clanking" (A, 143). The originality of Weiss's "noise of hallucinations" lies neither in its approximation of Pierre Schaeffer's <i>musique concrète</i>, for example, nor in its use in non-narrative film. Weiss's soundtrack is original because of its "acousmatic presence" and the lack that it signifies. Defined by Michel Chion as an offscreen sound that a film never traces visually back to its cause or source, the acousmatic in "Studie II" initially assumes a relationship with the bodies on screen.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The title shot [<a href="#6">re 6</a>], in which two sets of hands scratch away at the top of the frame, infers that this sound emanates from these fingers. This reciprocity quickly destabilizes as subsequent shots refrain from suturing image with sound. At one moment sounding from within the frame and in another from without it, the film's acousmatic noise ultimately originates from elsewhere, passes through the black voids in the open frame long enough to imply, briefly, a plausible correspondence with the image, and then moves on, reassuming sovereignty. The soundtrack's spatial voids—a simultaneous transcendence and omniscience—points to another space beyond, yet coterminous with the visible frame and affords it a voice. That this acousmatic sound in "Studie II" says nothing with language is crucial, for its high pitch and eerie timbre convey pure affect, a sense of the uncanny, if not horrific, that haunts the image. Cast within Lacan's linguistic schema, the "new acoustic world" in "Studie II" is the return of the real, the missed traumatic encounter that eludes the symbolic chain of meaning but nevertheless returns from beyond the image screen.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  This is the "stain" of exile, the original violence that tore the body asunder. </p>

<p>The subtitle of "Studie II" bears great significance. While Weiss, like Freud, conflated the visual distortions of dream work with the symptoms of psychoneuroses as homologous forms of regression from reality, hallucinations, as defined by Lacan (like Straus), belong to the dominion of psychoses and express themselves acoustically. For 

<b></b>

Lacan, the verbal hallucinations of the madman—voices that emanate from no one and nowhere—result when the barrier between reality and the real crumbles such that the real overflows reality. In this respect, the prefix "sur" in Weiss's surrealism is a poor fit. Surrealism's quest to disrupt and transcend reality, along with its dialectical resolution of boundaries between dreaming and waking, the conscious and unconscious, rationality and irrationality, misses Weiss's filmic project. "Studie II" abandons surrealism's dialectics of representation entirely. Just as the psychotic sees no difference between reality and the real, the film refrains from envisioning an alterity beyond its hermetically-sealed world of severed bodies. Weiss's post-fascist surrealist project is more realist than surrealist, for its dreams of fragmented bodies are entirely the product of historical traumas precipitated by fascism's violence. This is especially evident in the final tableau, in which the pile of bodies evokes unmistakable associations with the Holocaust's gruesome iconography. Given Weiss's preoccupation with exile, this conflation of psycho-phenomenal body fragmentation (as precipitated by displacement) and the savagery practiced in Nazi extermination camps might seem like self-indulgent conflation or, worse, a lapse into the "quietism of despair" common among zealous existentialists of the time. On the contrary, as Weiss established in his 1965 essay, "Meine Ortschaft," the cities and towns through which he passed as an exile all stood in singular opposition to the one place for which he, a European Jew, was meant: Auschwitz. "The living person who comes here from another world," he wrote of his late 1964 visit to Auschwitz, "possesses nothing other than his knowledge of facts, written reports, testimonies from witnesses. They are a part of his life, something he bears, but he can only apprehend that which befalls him."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  A foil with which to imagine the devastation of the Shoah and, conversely, an image with which to summate the corporeal fragmentation caused by forced displacement, exile and genocide are the recto and verso of a historical consciousness that Weiss would continue to designate the core of his work. Unlike his later literary and theatrical masterpieces that envisage historical narratives unfolding with respect to biographies, places, and events, Weiss's "Studie II" conceives of history visually in terms of its bodily effects. History, those originary forces that precipitated the dissociation of the human body in the first place, eludes the ocular empire entirely. Cast against Fredric Jameson's reading of Lacan's real as the diachronic dimension of history that transcends individual experience, the acousmatic presence in "Studie II" can be construed as a term limit in the film's engagement with the body. Not only does it accentuate the symptoms of trauma, but it also gives voice to the missing cause of that trauma, history.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Thus, "Studie II" imagines the conditions for working through trauma without realizing them. Locked into repetitive forms of acting-out (to which the desire for wholeness and the fragmentation of the body belong), the film nevertheless acknowledges a dimension beyond the synchronic realm of melancholy, a temporal space related to, yet different from it.

Coda: Impossible Returns

<p>In the eight years spent finding a publisher for his micro-novel, Weiss completed one full-feature, seven non-narrative, and five documentary films. In the late fifties, he began making collages, thought to be the final chapter of his early engagement with surrealism and the visual arts. With the micro-novel's publication in Germany, the loneliness of exile putatively ended. However, Weiss's literary return to Germany was anything but a homecoming. Initially published in 1960 in Franz Mon's compendium of postwar modernism, <i>movens</i>, vignettes seven and eight, which peak with the narrator's visit to the self-mutilating doctor, were to illustrate what Mon heralded as modernism's postwar "dialectic between the whole and the singular." Mon insisted that the works in his collection illustrated that the "artistic articulation" of symbol and reality can approach and approximate epistemologically the transcendental wholeness of the "thing itself," otherwise beyond the realm of everyday perception.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Weiss's micro-novel, especially this excerpt about the radical segmentation of the body, does not exemplify any such dialectical resolution. Contrary to Mon's assertions, the novel fails to acknowledge a dialectics of wholeness that Weiss's avant-garde film debunks. In a similar misappropriation, Walter Höllerer incorporated Weiss in a 1964 double-issue of the journal <i>Akzente</i>. The volume purported to assemble works by writers whom Höllerer considered the contemporary heirs to the historical avant-garde.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Grouped under Höllerer's rubric "change" [<i>Veränderung</i>], Weiss was included to illustrate a new breed of writing, one that disposed with the perception and memory of an increasingly specious everyday reality. The volume's roster of international writers was intended to demonstrate the power to negate the trivial and construct absolute modes of perception. Weiss's reinvention of surrealism was worlds apart from Höllerer's vision of a renewed avant-garde. The original violent moment that brought Weiss's project into being came from without and, given its traumatic constitution, prevented any such constructive impulse. As "Studie II" makes clear, the valuable legacies of surrealism after fascism lay in the ability to interrogate and arrest the desire for wholeness, to imagine the traumatic dissociation of the body as interminable, and to begin grasping the body in pieces vis-à-vis the history that violated it. </p>

<p id="lead">When the Anglo-American artists known as "neo-dada" rediscovered the work of Kurt Schwitters in the late 1950s, they thought they had found a model for robust artistic intervention that promised a way out of the strictures of Abstract Expressionism. Artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Allan Kaprow saw in Schwitters's collages of recycled refuse a model for critiquing the self-perpetuating cycle of consumerism and waste in capitalist societies. However, their interpretation of Schwitters's practices was based on a misreading of sorts, since Schwitters's use of trash in his collages had never been intended as an anti-capitalist critique of social relations in its day. Quite to the contrary. It had originally served to sustain a formalist aesthetics predicated on the autonomy of art from politics. Indeed, Schwitters's flaunted disinterest for politics with regard to Germany's aborted revolution and the turmoil of the early Weimar period had earned him the contempt of militant Dadaists like George Grosz and Richard Huelsenbeck, who curtly denied his request for admission to the Berlin Club Dada.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  </p>

<p>While critics have fully acknowledged Schwitters's path-breaking exploration of collage and assemblage, his productive blending of visual and verbal art forms, and his contributions to typography and advertising, they have also often concluded that his formalist understanding of art, revolving around the distinctive theory of montage he labeled <i>Merz</i>, was indebted to a nostalgic quest for order and harmony. According to this assessment, Schwitters conceived of art as a site of transcendence that promised the harmony and structure sorely missing in Weimar Germany. Yet Schwitters's putative desire for order and 

<b></b>

transcendence is difficult to reconcile with the exuberant transgression of boundaries—of the canvas, of the text, of different media and codes—that his montage practices relentlessly stage. Indeed, his art vigorously engages the messiness and incoherence of everyday experience rather than enacting its sublimation.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  This apparent contradiction raises the question of what kind of intervention is made possible by an artistic practice informed by abstraction, understood as a denial of ral representation or traditional narrative, and the combinatory principle of montage. In reconstructing the discourse on art and literature that unfolds in Schwitters's fictional and theoretical writings, I will show that his concept of montage embodies an understanding of reality as a universe of manipulable signs.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  By severing the link to representation, Schwitters fashioned art into an emancipatory realm for playing with the practices that make up ordinary signification, in a way that exposes their changeable and malleable nature.  </p>

<p>It is notable that the very aspects that made Schwitters appear marginal within prevalent accounts of Dadaism, namely, his emphasis on the specificity of artistic practice, his concern with reconceptualizing the art object, and his lack of iconoclastic rage even in his most radical experiments, have become central themes in recent endeavors to reevaluate Dada as a substantive, complex moment in the trajectory of the historical avant-garde.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  This article contributes to this reassessment by outlining the constructive intervention made by Schwitters's theory and practice of abstract montage. While it is true that Schwitters's hermetic practices refrained from commenting on the volatile mix of political retrenchments and socio-economic changes in Weimar Germany, they nevertheless modeled a type of emancipatory engagement with contemporary experience, albeit one that is qualitatively different from the political activism advocated by Grosz and Huelsenbeck in the early 1920s. This lies in conceptualizing art as a distinctive, cognitive medium that optimistically embraces the situatedness of ordinary practices of meaning-production, which it presents as open to subversive manipulation. </p>

<p>Schwitters's aesthetic practice and reflection turn on his program of <i>Merz</i>, a theory of abstract montage that supplied him with both an analytic framework and a brand label for his diverse artistic pursuits.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  His first comprehensive articulation of the concept is found in an essay from 1920 that sketches his position with regard to the politicization of the German avant-garde following the establishment of the Berlin Club Dada in 1918.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Schwitters's unstated aim in this text is to preempt the charge that his championing of abstraction is at bottom an escapist position, one that, as his sworn enemy Richard Huelsenbeck would argue, refused to take a robust political stance vis-à-vis the conservative retrenchments of post-war Germany while indulging the discredited idealism of Expressionism. The dispute with Huelsenbeck forced Schwitters to articulate the paradox at the heart of his project. That is, that art's non-representational, non-referential quality grounds its distinctiveness from other practices. At the same time, this very non-communicative quality, what Schwitters calls abstraction, also engenders art's transformative impact on experience. </p>

<p>Schwitters opens his essay on <i>Merz</i> by discussing the reasons for his turn against naturalistic representation in painting. In echoing Kandinsky's influential appeal on behalf of abstract painting in "On the Spiritual in Art," Schwitters maintains that the only

aim art pursues is expression, "Ausdruck." Notably, the invocation of this quintessential Expressionist category marks Schwitters' departure from the discourse of Expressionism, for "Ausdruck" is not a path to disclosing some spiritual reality obfuscated by the materialistic world, as in Kandinsky's momentous essay. In Schwitters's paradoxical use of the term, expression is not a means to an end, but is strictly pursued for its own sake. Its utter intransitivity is the very hallmark of art and grounds Schwitters's turn to abstraction in his collages.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Such emphasis on art's intransitivity may at first seem to echo the ascetic modernism championed by Clement Greenberg. According to Greenberg, the modernist disavowal of mimesis arises from the artist's polemical refusal to enter a relation with a contemporary experience defiled by materialism, greed, and corrupt power.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  This refusal engenders a self-reflexive inquiry into the expressive qualities of a given medium in a quest for truth that pushes beyond the appearance of the material world. Yet for Schwitters the emphasis lies not in exploring the possibilities of a medium in an ascetic quest for purity, but rather in the operation of establishing connections among discrete elements. Objects such as a baby carriage wheel, a segment of barbed wire, a piece of twine can be yanked out of their customary environment, divested of their purpose or meaning, and treated at a par with color and line on the canvas: "These objects [ . . . ] lose through their mutual juxtaposition their individual character, their distinctive quality, they are dematerialized and become materials for the painting" (<i>LW</i> 5, 134).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In other words, materials are chosen not for their inherent expressive qualities, but rather for their ability to enter into relationships with each other. Their intrinsic properties are of secondary relevance, while what truly counts are the connections that are established. The term <i>Merz</i> represents a direct illustration of this practice. As a syllable culled from the word "Commerzbank" ("Commerce Bank"), it did not have any recognizable meaning before Schwitters appropriated it. Once inserted in his discourse, it enters relationships with other terms and is charged with sense by the way it is used (<i>LW</i> 5, 77).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For Schwitters, the difference between artistic and non-artistic organization of materials lies in the distinctive relational pattern of aesthetic objects, what he calls their "rhythm," again appropriating a key term from the language of Expressionism. Rhythm denotes relationships that are not random or coincidental, but rather express a properly aesthetic logic.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Because art lacks the communicative logic that links objects in everyday experience, the pattern created by artistic relations is self-referential. The self-referential artwork is not an utterly intransitive monad, however, for it presupposes recipients who are able to relate to it meaningfully. In other words, for Schwitters contemporary art communicates with its recipients not by offering a recognizable, though jarring and defamiliarizing, semblance of the extra-artistic world, one that could be charged with polemical ideological content, as in Huelsenbeck's politicized model. In Schwitters's discourse, abstraction grounds an artistic practice that reassembles elements culled from experience by means of a logic that disregards the mutual relations of objects in everyday life. Its underlying montage principle allows for a dramatic extension of the possibilities of any given art form, since the range of materials that can be used is virtually limitless [<a href="#1">re 1</a>].<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> <b></b></p>

<p>By emphasizing the transformative power of abstract montage, the <i>Merz</i> essay defuses Huelsenbeck's charge of escapism. In fact, Schwitters's integration of sundry elements from everyday experience fulfills Huelsenbeck's central demand that Dada embrace the cacophony of modern life. Along these lines, Schwitters's principle of <i>Merz</i> is portrayed as both more radical and tolerant in its encompassing contemporary experience, provided one quits demanding that art be something it is not, namely, politics. In other words, Schwitters's dispute with Huelsenbeck boils down to the question of why enjoin art to do the job of politics if one already has politics. This question inevitably raises a number of additional issues: what is the job of art, exactly? What is the point of establishing new relations among available objects? And what do recipients get out of the abstract artworks Schwitters champions? These issues involve a reflection on the distinctive nature of artistic intervention that is crucial for the avant-garde. </p>

<p>To address these questions one must first examine the reach of the montage practices envisioned by Schwitters. Schwitters's discourse is part of the prodigious reflection on montage and collage that traverses modernism and the avant-garde at the beginning of the twentieth century. Paraphrasing a 1925 remark by German art historian Franz Roh, Christopher Phillips describes the impact of visual montage as the confluence of two crucial tendencies in modern visual culture, namely, modernist abstraction and the realism of the photographic fragment.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Along similar lines, Peter Bürger discusses Picasso's and Braque's <i>papiers collés</i> in terms of a clash between the non-representational 

<b></b>

thrust of cubist painting and the illusionism of the collated elements—one may think in this context of Picasso's iconic "Still Life with Chair Caning"  [<a href="#2">re 2</a>], which juxtaposes painted objects made unrecognizable by cubist stylization to a hyper-realist, faux-chair caning glued directly onto the canvas.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The possibility for playing abstraction off against realism relies on the double signification engendered by montage techniques, which operate via a transfer of materials from one context to another. In this transfer, materials become functional parts of the new context while maintaining allusions to the previous one(s). Hence, Picasso's fragment of fake chair-caning, while being one of several still life objects on the canvas, exceeds the painting's frame of reference by metonymically evoking the image of a chair. This metonymic reference to the 'real object,' obtained through the unsublimated insertion of a fragment from the object, playfully mocks the conventions of illusionistic representation, which are brought into sharper relief through contrast with the Cubist rendering of objects that make up the rest of the composition.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The point I want to emphasize here concerns the productive double-coding engendered by montage, which lies in the ability of the assembled fragments to point back to the contexts out of which they were extracted as though they were affected by an incurable semantic cross-eyedness. This ability for productive semantic collisions accounts for the lack of closure and jarring quality of montage practices and grounds their potential for a critical expansion of perception.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  However, this subversive moment is conspicuously absent in Schwitters's theoretical discourse on <i>Merz</i>. In his emphasis on stripping the materials of their former contextual valences, Schwitters apparently strives to suppress the realist orientation of the collated elements, i.e., their ability to point to a context extrinsic to the artwork. In other words, he seems to discount the fruitful double talk that defines collage, but it appears doubtful that the cross-eyedness of collage practices could ever be fully suppressed. How is one to expect that the fragment of the cigarette ad used in the collage "Miss Blanche" completely lose its ties to the world of advertisement and function as a blank signifier whose meaning derives solely from the relationships it enters into with other collaged elements?<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The simplemindedness of this belief in a full dematerialization of materials has stymied many scholars, lending credence to the image of Schwitters as an artist whose collage practices are boldly experimental, but whose concept of art as a self-contained realm of order and harmony is at bottom escapist and nostalgic. And yet, the essay on <i>Merz</i> offers a far more nuanced understanding of montage than the contention that one can fully divest materials of their references to previous contexts. Specifically, the discussion of <i>Merz</i> poetry, that is, the unfolding of <i>Merz</i> in language, displays Schwitters's awareness about the insuppressible semantic ambivalence of montage:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Poetry arises from the playing off of these elements against each other. Meaning is only essential if it is to be used as one such factor. I play off sense against nonsense. I prefer nonsense, but that is a purely personal matter. I pity nonsense, because until now it has been so neglected in the making of art, and that's why I love it.</p>

<p class="continued">

Much like <i>Merz</i> painting, <i>Merz</i> poetry is abstract in the sense that it aims at establishing unconventional relationships among the broadest range of materials. This is obtained by playing off words against each other, as well as any available, preformed linguistic units, which represent the equivalent of the sundry materials Schwitters used for his visual collages. Schwitters implicitly acknowledges that such materials—phrases, slogans, clichés—come with attached, contextual meaning. After all, it is their very formulaic character that makes them into discrete units to be treated as ready-made objects. While it is not possible to fully desemanticize words and phrases, that is, to completely suppress the meanings that adhere to them, one can treat such meanings as just one factor among others when it comes to the process of reassembling linguistic units. The priority here lies in expanding the range of artistic expression. Hence, non-sense is as good a material for <i>Merz</i> poetry as is sense. Indeed, it constitutes the linguistic counterpart of the refuse Schwitters fervently collected for use in his collages. </p>

<p>While Schwitters's visual work can readily be subsumed under the related categories of collage and assemblage, it is more difficult to glimpse in montage the overarching principle that informs his rich literary output, which encompasses plays, collage poems, essays, and fictional prose texts.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In the visual arts, abstraction is easily understood as connoting a rejection of ration, illusionism, or mimetic representation, but it is far more difficult to say what it may entail for media that draw on verbal language. Schwitters's consistent emphasis on practices informed by a principle of juxtaposition clearly indicates that abstract montage remains the broad frame of reference for his 

<b></b>

oeuvre over three decades, even where it does not overtly shape his textual practice. Indeed, an examination of what <i>Merz</i> means for literature shows that montage for Schwitters does not merely connote a set of combinatory practices, but more fundamentally discloses crucial processes of meaning production. In other words, the unfolding of montage in literature sheds light on the function of art in general and thus deserves closer scrutiny. </p>

<p>Based on Schwitters's own characterization of <i>Merz</i> literature in the passage quoted above, abstraction lies in disregarding the conventional ties among linguistic materials by establishing new connections in which the common meanings attaching to linguistic units of various kinds are played off against the non-sense produced by unconventional combinations. An enlightening example of this practice is found in the caustic, concise essays Schwitters wrote in response to negative reviews of his works.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  These early prose texts, whose bold linguistic and textual experimentation points to the influence of both Expressionism and Dada, weave humorous patchworks collaging Schwitters's attacks on critics, quotations from the critics' own reviews, and seemingly unrelated linguistic material, ranging from simple phrases to complete sentences, which are usually set off by parentheses. The following passage, drawn from an essay published in the Berlin avant-garde journal <i>Der Sturm</i> in 1920, provides a good example for the sardonic tone of these short essays and exemplifies their primary textual strategy:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>For a moment today, let us 'take up' Mr. Felix Neumann. "Nothing kills faster than ridiculousness," he writes. But dear Sir, you are committing suicide! Didn't you read your article of January 6, 1920 in the Post? Sheer suicide! (Nothing kills faster than ridiculousness.) [ . . . ] You say I'm gnawing with a thousand like-minded comrades at the roots of our strength. (A pretty picture.) Don't you mean: your strength? No, a million times, no, I'm not gnawing, put your mind at ease. I am no rat and you are no tree. I wouldn't have the first clue where to find the roots of your strength. Besides, I would prefer to gnaw my way alone, if you please, without thousands of co-gnawers. But I am no rodent. On the contrary; I am the one being gnawed on.

<p class="continued">This passage seizes on two offhand remarks in the critic's review, the proverb-like motto "Nothing kills faster than ridiculousness," used to disparage Schwitters's poetry in the volume <i>Anna Blume Dichtungen</i> ("Anna Blume Poems," 1919), and the charge regarding Schwitters's presumed detrimental influence on contemporary audiences: "he gnaws at the roots of our strength with a thousand like-minded souls." The critic's hyperbolic style is mocked by Schwitters, who seizes on the metaphorical, "pretty image," of the harmful rodent gnawing away at the roots of a tree, and humorously unfolds it as though it had been meant literally. This allows him to debunk the chauvinistic insinuation entailed in the critic's image of a hoard of rats chipping away at the healthy roots of "our" strength, by suggesting that at issue must rather be the critic's own strength: "You mean your strength?" Secondly, Schwitters turns the degrading image of the gnawing rodent against the critic himself, claiming that, if anything, he 

<b></b>

is the one being attacked in a parasitic and insidious way ("gnawed on"), while also protesting the suggestion that he is just one of an entire hoard of artists who are doing exactly the same things he does. Finally, the text makes its own strategies manifest in the last comic death threat launched against the critic. If, as the critic had pompously stipulated in reviewing Schwitters's collages, "nothing kills faster than ridiculousness," then Schwitters threatens to simply re-use a few sentences from the critic's own review, whose preposterousness renders them a lethal weapon. The whole review, Schwitters establishes at the beginning, is tantamount to suicide by the critic's own standard that "nothing kills faster than ridiculousness." </p>

<p>This excerpt well illustrates Schwitters's strategy of seizing on words and phrases from the critic's review and recycling them by "merz-ing" them, that is, adapting them for a new context. One strategy exemplified above includes removing a term, "gnawing," from its syntagmatic context and exploring its paradigmatic relations to other terms. This forms an equivalent to exploiting the cross-eyedness of collaged fragments in Picasso's "Still Life," for the semantic valence of the verb "gnawing" is not allowed to exhaust itself in the actualization of the meaning suggested by the critic's sentence. Rather, the word is made to look outside the sentence in search for other meanings that could be actualized within the linguistic context of the citation. This leads to a slippage from metaphorical to literal meaning, so that "gnawing" is interpreted as concretely pointing to the activity of rodents. A whole new context is constructed around the sentence to support this new, actualized meaning, giving way to a humorous juxtaposition between the new literal image (this painter is a rodent who is eating away at the roots of our tree) and the charge entailed in the critic's puffed-up metaphor (this painter is a persistent, though not immediately visible threat to the health of our national art and culture). Arguably, the non-sense that is produced in this way makes a lot of sense as a weapon of ridicule turned against the critic. The humor is compounded by the fact that it is the critic's own claims, in their recycled form, which help to expose his pompousness and smugness.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Schwitters's montage principle entails an assault on the linear unfolding of discourse, which is constantly interrupted by parenthetical inserts that either provide a commentary or contain seemingly unrelated, disparate linguistic material. This practice corresponds to Schwitters's characterization of abstract montage as a process aimed at establishing novel, unconventional relations among existing elements. The nonsense produced in this way does not make the impression of chaos, however, but instead unfolds in a highly methodical way, engendering a coherent, parallel universe to sense.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This is very different from the assault on poetic coherence that marks the Expressionist <i>Wortkunst</i> ("Word Art") tradition (endorsed by the avant-garde circle around <i>Der Sturm</i>), which Schwitters had initially followed. This poetic model revolved around stripping language to its bones, allowing for an ecstatic feeling to replace grammatical structure. The result are texts dominated by paratactic constructions and word chains, as exemplified by the poetry of August Stramm, its most celebrated representative. By contrast, Schwitters's language is set in motion not by releasing the unstructured intensity of feeling, but rather by exploring alternatives to its ordinary use, which is 

<b></b>

thus exposed as conventional. In this context non-sense does not represent a negation of sense through the polemical display of gibberish. Rather non-sense appears contiguous to sense, as a manipulation of available material that is close enough to sense to be deciphered as the other of conventional meaning, but outlandish enough to be recognized as lying outside of the established automatism of signification.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Schwitters's description of how <i>Merz</i> functions in the domain of literature is especially enlightening as an illustration of the cultural shift described by Helmut Lethen for Weimar Germany, away from a conception of meaning as essentially given and toward understanding communication as based on models of conduct designed to protect individuals in a potentially hostile social arena. Lethen argues that the collapse of the ideology of inwardness and metaphysical essences that had buttressed German culture up to Expressionism produces, in the post-war world of Weimar, a culture of appearances, in which the inner guide of conscience has given way to the exterior pressure of shame.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In a culture based on exteriority, communication is not about expression of some inward substance. Rather, as suggested by Schwitters's juxtaposition of sense and non-sense, it is an outward practice that functions through the manipulation of existing materials and signs. In this context, one should also note the dispassionate, cool terminology, to use another of Lethen's categories, that structures Schwitters's discourse on art, and that decisively sets it off from the "incandescent," late-idealistic pathos of Expressionism. "Evaluate," "play off," "given parts," "materials," "factors" are the central concepts denoting artistic practice. This language conveys an understanding of experience not as an organic totality, but rather as a relational network defined by contingent, shifting practices. Art represents an intervention on these practices that playfully manipulates existing elements to obtain different relational conrations. In so doing, it prides itself with recycling even those elements that have lost their original purpose, such as refuse, or those linguistic segments that do not make sense in the conventional system of communication, and are thus designated as non-sense. </p>

<p>Lethen's discussion also accounts for the intense agonistic quality of Schwitters's replies to his critics, which can easily cross into the vituperative. Their abrasive tone well fits into the shift to a culture of shame that forms a crucial building block in Lethen's argument. As Lethen maintains, in a setting that valorizes preserving one's self-esteem in the eyes of others and avoiding the shame that arises from being caught at fault, shaming rituals take the place of the pangs of conscience in sanctioning undesirable behavior. Schwitters's texts stage just such rituals by drawing on the tool of parody. That is, their main shaming strategy lies in debunking the critics' credibility and authority by repeating their statements with some key modification so as to cast ridicule on them, a strategy that is explicitly thematized in the passage quoted above. In the least successful texts this strategy comes across as perfunctory and cheap. Its basic rhetorical gesture, which can be summed up as "You said this of me, but I turn this charge against you so as to make you appear ludicrous," quickly grows old, begging the question why Schwitters did not occasionally come up with more substantial arguments in response to his critics than the trick of parody. Lethen's discussion of Weimar's shaming rituals provides an answer to this question, as one can argue that Schwitters's aim in these 

<b></b>

texts is not to engage his critics in a meaningful debate, but rather to discredit them by exposing them to public ridicule. There is, however, another, more significant reason that accounts for the predominance of parody in these texts. It lies in the key role that parody plays in Schwitters's understanding of montage. Specifically, in Schwitters's work parody is not limited to a traditional strategy of mocking criticism, but rather discloses the fundamental way in which communication functions. </p>

<p>Bernd Scheffer has emphasized Schwitters's extensive use of parodic practices of (self)quotation, which is especially conspicuous in his early literary work and finds a paradigmatic example in "An Anna Blume" ("For Anna Blossom"), one of the most successful poems of the Weimar Republic.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Indeed, Anna Blume functions as a protean trope that gains a life of its own in Schwitters's texts, returning in a variety of incarnations that traverse his early oeuvre. The strategy of recycling his own work involves elements of various kinds, ranging from single characters to titles of prose texts and entire textual fragments varying in size from a few lines from the first Anna Blume poem to several paragraph-length segments.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  What makes this practice notable is the extent to which the recycled materials remain fully recognizable as inserts, never completely losing their tie to the context from which they were extracted. </p>

<p>This characterization helps foreground the common ground shared by parody and montage in Schwitters's work. Parody must be understood in this context as endowed with the broad meaning described by Linda Hutcheon, who defines it as a "repetition with critical distance, which marks difference rather than similarity." For Hutcheon, the parodic goes well beyond the traditional practice of imitating a text or an object while injecting the imitation with some humorous difference aimed at casting ridicule on the model. To be sure, Hutcheon echoes the traditional definition of parody in seeing the relation between the model and the parodied text as one of "ironic inversion." However, she stresses that the irony is "not always at the expense of the parodied text," but rather serves to mark the moment of difference, i.e., to make clear that the imitation is at variance with the original.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  When considered within the context of Schwitters's montage practices, parody is a strategy for recycling materials where the moment of recycling or imitation is made explicit by the ironic variation on the original. Reusing materials derived both from his own work and that of others, Schwitters weaves a complex patchwork of relations in which texts are never fully contained in themselves, but always point outside their contingent boundaries to allude to other texts. In its manifest double-coding, parody functions as an overt intertextual strategy that foregrounds the signifying mechanism proper to montage. This practice challenges conventional notions of authorship and the bounded text while at the same time establishing a high degree of coherence in Schwitters's oeuvre. It is a type of coherence that is not so much predicated on the repetition of specific content or materials as on the formal relations that repetition establishes. </p>

<p>The role and scope of parody, understood as a formal web sustained by an ironic principle of repetition, is paradigmatically illustrated in "Schacko," a story from 1926, which also probes the meaning of abstraction in literature.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The story's title is borrowed from the name of its central re, a parrot whose illness and untimely death 

<b></b>

constitute the narrative's primary focus. Most of the story is told in the first person by the parrot's owner, a woman mourning the recent death of her husband. "Such a naked tiny animal" she repeats tirelessly. As she explains, the bird pulled out all its feathers during the time spent with the bed-ridden man, whose pains compelled him to keep the lights on at night. Unable to sleep, the parrot compulsively picked at its plumage (<i>LW</i> 2, 289). The vet has now been summoned to save the bird, who becomes afflicted in tight sequence by constipation due to a hernia, a sudden, disastrous attack of diarrhea, and, finally, by fluid in its lungs, which causes its ultimate demise. The story ends, quite humorously, with the fearless woman performing an improvised autopsy to ascertain the bird's cause of death. She then lovingly buries its corpse at the feet of her husband's grave, thus fulfilling his last wish. </p>

<p>In a preface to the 1933 reprint of the story Schwitters explicitly thematizes the role of abstraction in literature: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is very difficult to realize abstraction in literature [ . . . ] I would like to point to the structure of "<b>Schacko</b>," to its abstract law of <b>composition</b>. I have heard Schacko's story myself told from a woman, <b>word for word, the whole tale</b> [ . . . ] this brought the material closer to me from a human standpoint; but <b>as such</b> it was not yet an artwork. <b>The matter became an artwork only through form</b>: how the woman's statements are juxtaposed to each other, how they are repeated, complement each other, how they anticipate or confirm each other, how they hang together as a whole so as to make ever more manifest the woman's love for her husband, <b>an abstract concept</b>, and her desperation, <b>yet again an abstract concept</b>, and this is <b>the content of this story</b>. You can analyze all my texts in this way and you will have to admit that their form is always abstract in this way: statements are juxtaposed to each other.</p>

<p class="continued">According to this passage, the narrative is based on a true story which its protagonist related to the writer of the preface. While the story is not made up, it is also not a faithful recording of the tale told by the woman. Rather the narrative recycles materials provided by the model by rearranging them within the medium of literature. Its artistic attributes, that which distinguishes it from the woman's narration, lie in its distinctive form, what Schwitters calls its abstract law of composition. Form in this context concerns the way in which the woman's statements, which are made more poignant by their disarming ordinariness, are merzed/collaged, that is, repeated and juxtaposed so as to bring to the fore what are essentially abstract constructs, namely, her feelings of love and desperation. This abstract content calls for the deployment of formal abstraction, which in this case denotes the refusal to render the woman's state of mind through a mimetic narrative that would draw on conventional psychological observation. Hence, the terms love and desperation are never used in reference to her. Yet the narrative enacts these abstract concepts through its structure and linguistic form, which thus bear further scrutiny. </p>

<p>The story is composed of thirteen sections typographically set off by horizontal lines. The first nine sections contain the woman's first-person account; the tenth segment bears the title "<b>POSTSCRIPT</b> (For the Reader's Orientation)" and introduces segments told from the perspective of an omniscient narrator, who claims to have heard the story

 from the woman herself (<i>LW</i> 2, 291). [<a href="#3">res 3</a>–5] The narrative is patterned after the rapid back and forth of vernacular dialogue, which at times contains short descriptive inserts providing a bare minimum of background information. Each section reintroduces and juxtaposes phrases and idioms from the previous sections in an almost compulsive manner, which at once foregrounds the formulaic character of the linguistic material and the intensity of feeling that underlies its use. The repetition of and variation on utterly banal, yet affectionate phrases such as "such a naked tiny animal," "turn around now," "shame on you, Schacko!" (referring to the parrot's nakedness and wretched looks) drive the story on toward its poignant, grotesquely comic ending.

<p>What makes the parrot especially fascinating is the semblance of meaningful exchange that arises when people address it. The wife tells the doctor that the bird does not just mimic the sounds it hears, but rather uses the words it repeats in a deliberate manner (<i>LW </i>2, 290). The woman's apparent delusion adds a humorous and poignant touch to the narration. At the same time, it draws attention to the pattern of repetition that structures the communication between the actors of the dialogue. Indeed, the speakers feed off each other's verbal input in ways that recall the communication modeled by the parrot. In their repetitions these speakers do not just 'parrot' each other, that is, mindlessly reproduce fragments of sonoric sequences, but rather they modulate them, adding new touches.  </p>

<p>The principle of repetition also extends to the larger segments that make up the narrative. For instance, sections seven, eight, and nine each appear to be an expansion of the previous. In barely two lines, section seven describes the woman's discovery that the parrot's intestines bulge out as a result of the hernia. Section eight picks up on this description, while identifying constipation as the cause of the parrot's bulging parts and recounting the disastrous resolution of the parrot's problem when the bird relieves itself on the train taking the woman to the vet. In section nine, the scene is relived and amplified in the woman's dramatic retelling to the doctor. When considered within the story's overall structure, the sections appear to parrot each other, repeating and modulating elements from the previous ones while also adding new detail. While suggesting a clear sequence of events, the overlapping repetitions disrupt the sense of closure and sequential unfolding of traditional narrative. The exuberance and vividness of this seemingly incontrollable repetition harness the text's impact on the recipient. Though the expectation of logically unfolding communication is frustrated at every turn, there is another type of communication taking place, which presupposes a different kind of intelligibility. This type of intelligibility understands communication as a parodic montage of materials. Communication, in other words, is about recycling materials that 

<b></b>

are already out there by inserting them into different contexts and establishing new connections among them. As an enactment of abstract literature, the text parrots the way meaning is transmitted through communication, that is, it imitates it in an ironic mode. In so doing, it shows that the building blocks of communication are never new, original, untainted, but always encumbered with resonances from other contexts. </p>

<p>Understanding communication as an assemblage of found materials suggests a parallel to Marcel Duchamp's experimentation with the ready-made and the found object in the 1910s and '20s, with which Schwitters was well familiar.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  While there is much ground shared by the two artists, for the purpose of this essay it will be instructive to briefly review the different assumptions that undergird their deployment of preformed materials. Whereas Duchamp's recycling of found objects was guided by the question "Under which conditions can this object be presented as an art object?",<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  i.e., aimed to test the conventions of art by probing the boundary between art and non-art, Schwitters was never interested in placing the status of art in question. In fact, while ransacking all possible media and idioms for his work, Schwitters never wavered in his belief in the autonomy of the artistic medium, defined as the possibility of establishing non-conventional relations among everyday objects, which recipients would readily identify as art. If Duchamp sought to challenge the self-adjudicated, exceptionalist ontology of art by exposing its dependence on contextual, that is, institutional factors, Schwitters was more interested in the claim to ordinariness of everyday life. In other words, one could describe Schwitters's practice by inverting Duchamp's questions, "What makes art into art? What grounds art's claim to an extraordinary status?" so as to ask "How ordinary is the non-artistic? What lies behind the ordinariness of everyday objects?" </p>

<p>This focus on the ordinary quality of everyday experience recalls Marjorie Perloff's discussion of two competing modernist paradigms for engaging poetic language. The dominant model, Perloff maintains, is defined by belief in a fundamental "distinction between the 'practical' language of 'ordinary' communication and the 'autonomous' language of poetry."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  This distinction is sustained by a centuries-old reflection on language, art, and philosophy that has been encoded through a variety of oppositions: scientific vs. artistic, cognitive vs. emotive, denotative vs. connotative, literal vs. ral, ordinary vs. defamiliarizing. Perloff draws on Wittgenstein's reflection on linguistic practice in the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> to describe a second strain of modernist poetics. This latter model rejects the distinction between literary and ordinary language and rather views the aesthetic as a realm for scrutinizing ordinary language use, that is, the everyday practices by which we communicate and produce meaning. This examination helps expose the fundamental strangeness of these practices, that is, their situatedness and conventional nature, the fact that they could be organized differently and be just as meaningful. From this vantage point art appears as a medium for grasping ordinary signifying practices by means of a performance that makes them appear unfamiliar. This is the modernist strain that grounds Schwitters's interrogation of the 'ordinariness of the ordinary' via a manipulation of its materials.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Wittgenstein's exploration of language as a rule-guided practice, a set of games whose conventions are rooted in the shared way of life of speakers offers an enlightening 

<b></b>

perspective for assessing Schwitters's manipulation of nonsense in the response to the critic's review discussed above. If, according to Wittgenstein, meaning is produced by arranging signifying elements according to the rules of a game, then Schwitters's strategies in this excerpt consist in engaging the critic's language game while tweaking with its rules.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Specifically, Schwitters refuses to interpret the image of the "gnawing critter" in the metaphorical sense in which it was intended and instead unfolds its literal meaning, so as to debunk its chauvinistic and debasing implications. This operation indirectly questions just how ordinary the metaphorical deployment of this image is in reference to the impact of experimental, avant-garde art. Should the disparaging allusion to pest-bringing rodents be treated as a common-place way of critiquing artistic experiments one finds objectionable? How innocuous is this mode of critique? And how much does one learn about the object at stake from this kind of insinuation? Schwitters's attack on what he perceives as a dishonest, because uninformed and uninformative, critique does not marshal reasoned arguments to make its point, but rather unfolds via a linguistic performance that debunks the claim to ordinariness of a slandering metaphor.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In <i>Schacko</i>, the ordinariness of phrases like "Such a naked tiny animal" mutates into its opposite by way of exuberant repetition, which is made to express the intense feeling that propels the utterance. The banal vernacular phrase thus becomes a touching cipher for the tender, inarticulate love that binds the woman to an unpleasant pet she cherishes as a remnant of life with her husband. Furthermore, the linguistic behavior of the characters in <i>Schacko</i> presents close affinities to Wittgenstein's understanding of language games. Their communication unfolds as a chain of overlapping repetitions based on mimicking each others' utterances while also infusing them with difference so as to adapt them to their needs. The impression one gains is that of a disorderly patchwork of exchanges that lack a discernible pattern or recognizable rules, but are nonetheless effective in negotiating meaning. This is because the speakers are willing to take their cues from their interlocutors, that is, they appropriate each others' phrases while modifying them as needed. Drawing on a central Wittgensteinian trope, one could say that they play a game whose rules they do not just follow, but also adapt and expand in response to contingent conrations.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  The point I want to stress here regards the distinctive understanding of language and communication Schwitters shares with Wittgenstein's later philosophy. Communication in this context is not about choosing one option over another from some deep structure of language which would function as a blueprint for possible games. As Stanley Cavell has noted, the novelty and profundity of Wittgenstein's inquiry reside in the realization "that everyday language does not, in fact or in essence, depend upon such a structure and conception of rules, and yet that the absence of such a structure in no way impairs its functioning."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  This well describes Schwitters's anti-psychological understanding of communication as an aggregate of contingent modes of behavior that bind individuals via a parodic mechanism of repetition. That these individuals are conspicuously bereft of an inward space by no means curtails their agency, i.e., their ability to engage in meaningful practices.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>What good is the realization that making and trading sense is not about actualizing some systematic properties of language? What kind of artistic intervention does this realization make possible and call for? In other words, what is the relationship between art and the practices of meaning-production that harness everyday experience in a productively disorderly, unpredictable, open-ended network? To answer these questions in closing, I would like to examine a short story, a parable of sorts, which Schwitters wrote in an ironic attempt to educate art critics, and that was published in 1920. The story is titled after its unlikely heroine, Augusta Bolte, an eager young woman whose life becomes unhinged one day when she decides to follow ten people she sees walking on the street. Though they at first seem to be mere strangers, the fact that they walk in the same direction and the sheer roundness of the number ten convince Augusta that the ten are involved in a mysterious operation that promises the disclosure of life's wisdom. Certain that her life now depends on solving this riddle, Augusta embarks on a series of adventures that prove to be every bit as absurd as the reasoning that triggered her initial pursuit. </p>

<p>The narrative unfolds along a multilayered pattern of repetitions that are enacted at various levels. One such layer consists of the methodic repetitiveness of Augusta's thought processes, which the narration meticulously renders. Yet the more the narrator praises the young woman for her intelligence, talent, and methodical thinking, the clearer it becomes that Augusta's systematic approach is of absolutely no help in dealing with the events that confront her. For instance, Augusta gets comically hung up on the recurring rhyme patterns of her own interior monolog and feels compelled to discern in them some mysterious sense: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>And now? How now? A scandalous rhyme! How rhymed with now. Beyond that it seemed especially peculiar to Miss Augusta that not only did how rhyme with now, but now also rhymed with how [ . . . ] The rhyme came up her throat like cod-liver oil<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  [ . . . ] For when something's happening then the most unrhymed things happen to happen. Then all of a sudden what never rhymed before, rhymes. Let's sum up! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 people were walking in one and the same direction, now rhymed with how. Something obviously had to be going on. How should Augusta find out?</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>pppppp,</i> 141)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Augusta's reasoning in this passage is based on a pun involving the German word for rhyme: "sich reimen" also has the metaphorical meaning of "making sense," "hanging together in a meaningful way;" by the same token, "unrhymed" ("ungereimt") means inconsistent. So when Augusta detects unexpected rhymes in her self-monologue, she concludes that they must be cues for some deeper meaning. However, the literal rhymes that are involved here are really only a sound pattern.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  They exhibit recognizable formal relationships, but have no inherent meaning.  </p>

<p>Augusta ultimately fails to learn the secret of life, but her experiences have not been in vain. Every turn of her oddball story is a step forward in an educational trajectory that earns her ever higher academic degrees. In the end she realizes that experience is structured by relationships that have no inherent meaning. One has to invest them with meaning by deciding what to care about, and what to interpret (<i>pppppp,</i> 162).

<b></b>

This is not at all a nihilistic insight, but rather has a liberating effect, because it relieves Augusta from the anxious quest for the hidden meaning she believes to glimpse in the random patterns that structure experience. This realization prompts her to make a clean break with her previous life and concentrate on pursuing a young man, who she is convinced makes a worthy husband. This pursuit however comes to an abrupt end when the driver of the cab she has enrolled in the chase abandons her in a remote location because she cannot pay the fare. In this way the narrative averts not only a happy ending, but any kind of ending. The only measure of closure is offered by the narrator, who polemically takes center stage in the last paragraph and addresses the readers so as to preempt their anticipated criticism: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The reader might have thought that something would be happening here; [ . . . ] Certainly the reader will think that Miss Dr. Lif<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  would find out who or what is going on, but she finds out nothing. The reader believes that he has the right to find out, but the reader has no right, and certainly not the right to find out anything in a work of art. [ . . . ] It's just that the story is over, simply over, no matter how sorry I am no matter how brutal it must sound, there's nothing else I can do.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(<i>pppppp, </i>163–64)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This declaration by the narrator effectively turns the tables on the reader. It becomes apparent that the reader has been tricked into having fun at Augusta's expense only to find out that he or she has been performing operations similar to Augusta's in reading the story. Like Augusta, the reader has tried to make sense of the narrated events by deciphering narrative cues, by ruling out possible readings, and by making predictions on how the story would continue or end. In foreclosing any conclusion that could tie the narrative together in a meaningful way, the narrator admonishes the reader that one does not have the right to expect to learn anything from an artwork. There is nothing to understand or learn from this story, because there is nothing to learn or understand from art. In this way, the story establishes a parallel between the contingent structure of experience and art. Everyday experience comprises an array of events one navigates without subjecting them to a systematic logic. Many of them exhibit contingent connections, but do not necessarily make sense. Art is just this kind of event or object. Its connections have no intrinsic sense, and yet are not without structure. </p>

<p>In spite of the narrator's refusal to supply a meaningful conclusion for the story, the reader does have something to take away at the end. In a way, the story provides a lesson in conduct as described by Helmut Lethen. Specifically, it presents meaning as negotiated through Augusta's practice. Augusta's conduct is however a negative example, a model of how not to negotiate meaning in everyday experience. As it becomes clear, the flipside of Augusta's obsession with random structures is her inability to interact meaningfully with the individuals who cross her path. Her solipsistic determination to decode structures that supposedly hold the meaning of life is precisely the opposite of the cooperative behavior of speakers who negotiate communication based on games whose rules are constantly remade through playing. Rather than actively play by ear in the ever-shifting game of signification, Augusta is played by the structure and therefore loses. In the end she may well understand that the structures one encounters in 

<b></b>

experience have no inherent meaning, but she never learns to interact effectively with others, including the cab driver who abandons her in the middle of nowhere. With Augusta, the reader comes to see that the practice of ascribing meaning to patterns solely based on their structural regularity is misguided. Meaning is based on patterns, but does not automatically flow from them. In a similar way, art's formal relations do not produce meaning in any ordinary sense of the word, but unfold contiguously to ordinary processes of meaning-production, which they present in a defamiliarizing form that questions their ordinariness and thus makes them conspicuous. Schwitters, who has been accused of reducing art to formalist play, delivers a paradoxical indictment of formalism with this narrative, while providing a wonderful enactment of his concept of abstract, autonomous art. </p>

<p>Schwitters's montage principle envisions art as a realm for playing with the contingent practices of meaning-production. The abstraction of artistic practice places non-sense along side sense, not to deny the possibility of meaning but to make signifying structures apparent. This is crucial for assessing the value of Schwitters's belief in abstraction and his distinctive brand of formalism. When seen from this perspective, Schwitters's abstraction turns out to be the opposite of the refusal of narrativity, which for Rosalind Krauss informs the modernist tendency to abstraction. For Krauss, the quest for formal purity and compulsion of repetition, which sustains the avant-garde obsession with the grid, foregrounds the structure of permanent deferral that characterizes signification. Put in terms of the Saussurian distinction between <i>langue</i> and <i>parole</i>, Krauss focuses on <i>langue</i> as a systematic network of relations that stages an ultimate absence.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Schwitters's formalism, by contrast, is about the <i>parole</i> aspect of language, about its being a playground for the contingent games of signification. Hence, Schwitters's hybrid verbal and visual collages veer toward the messiness of everyday communication rather than toward the purity of a system. By the same token, Schwitters holds on to an emphatic understanding of artistic agency. The artist is not played by structure or beholden to the unfolding of chance, but rather is actively engaged in the game of meaning. </p>

<p>This engagement does not translate into a critical practice that aims to redress perceived injustices by challenging established hierarchies of power. Richard Huelsenbeck was right to find Schwitters wanting in this respect and to point to the affirmative impulse sustaining his work. What Schwitters's work affirms, however, is not the bourgeois order which it fails to condemn, but rather the possibility of an experience whose meaning is constructed and ever-shifting, yet can nonetheless be perceived as whole and consequential. This affirmative moment helps place into perspective Schwitters's emphatic insistence on the autonomy of artistic practice, which is held to stand in an intransitive relation to everyday signifying practices while paradoxically feeding off them. While shunning overt political engagement, Schwitters's avant-garde impulse does nonetheless actualize one strong meaning of critique, conceived as the task of probing the presuppositions and boundaries that delimit a given practice. In this sense, art is held to be a distinct cognitive medium for testing ordinary signifying practices via an investigation that makes them appear unfamiliar. This investigation 

<b></b>

exposes their lack of a supratemporal structure and being driven by parodic repetition instead, which highlights their contingency and manipulability. Such insights are optimistically framed as an opportunity for expanding the range of signification, an agenda Schwitters relentlessly pursued in a range of practices that pushed the bounds of established genres and media. <i>Merz</i>, the principle of abstract montage that undergirds his work, rests on the realization that the intersubjective practice we call meaning is but a restricted set of possible games. Its playful challenge to the 'ordinariness of the ordinary' exemplarily fulfills the avant-garde imperative of an engagement with lived experience, as it fearlessly hurls artistic practice into the midst of the disorderly games of meaning and exhorts the players to expand the range of possible moves that will allow them to stay in the game. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT1" href="#REF1">1</a>. Schwitters was born in Hanover in 1887. In the 1920s and 1930s he collaborated with some of the most innovative artists of Dada, De Stijl, and Constructivism. In 1937 he was forced to flee Nazi Germany and emigrate to Norway and later to Britain, where he died in 1948. In the 1950s, avant-garde artists in Europe and the United States discovered in his work a formidable model for blending visual and verbal art forms that opened the way for pop and conceptual art. For a discussion of Schwitters's impact on post-World-War-II art, see Gwendolen Webster,<i> Kurt Merz Schwitters: A Biographical Study</i> (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1997).

<p><a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>. Leah Dickerman points to the incongruous relation between Schwitters's occasional recourse to a "rhetoric of purity" in reference to his collages and "the radicalism of [his] formal procedures—its wholesale openness to stuff of the modern world, its assault on traditional concepts of medium, and its reconration of the terms of distribution." Dickerman notes that Schwitters's scholarship has in various degrees subscribed to Huelsenbeck's assessment of Schwitters as "someone insufficiently political and overly bourgeois," thereby lending credence to the image of Schwitters as an artist whose practices were revolutionary, but whose naïve, child-like attitude fueled a propensity for escapist, uncommitted play. Leah Dickerman, "<i>Merz</i> and Memory: On Kurt Schwitters," in Leah Dickerman and Matthew S. Witkovsky, eds, <i>The Dada Seminars</i> (Washington, D.C.: National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2005),105; see also note 12, 123. A case in point is Kurt Schmalenbach's monograph, the first comprehensive study of the post-World-War II period, which portrays Schwitters as an innocent, child-like genius. Werner Schmalenbach, <i>Kurt Schwitters</i> (Köln: DuMont, 1967). This image has become especially ingrained in the Anglophone reception of Schwitters's oeuvre. For instance, Huelsenbeck's emphasis on Schwitters's apolitical attitude reemerges in Benjamin Buchloh's assessment of his collage practices as marked by "a meditative contemplation of reification," which Buchloh contrasts with the activist model of "mass agitation" exemplified by John Heartfield's photo-montages. Benjamin H.D. Buchloh, "Allegorical Procedures: Appropriation and Montage in Contemporary Art," <i>Artforum</i> 21 (September 1982): 43–56, here 43. John Elderfield also endorses the evaluation of Schwitters as indebted to a nostalgic late Romanticism, an assessment which he however embeds in a complex, wide-ranging analysis of both his visual and literary oeuvre that remains an unsurpassed resource for Schwitters's scholarship to date. John Elderfield, <i>Kurt Schwitters</i> (London: Thames and Hudson, 1985).On the whole, Schwitters's literary oeuvre has received far less attention than his visual work. Interest flourished in Germany in the 1970s, when Schwitters was seen as a forerunner of experimental literature. See the 1972 issue of <i>Text + Kritik</i> dedicated to Schwitters's literary work, as well as the monograph by Bernd Scheffer, <i>Anfänge experimenteller Literatur. Das literarische Werk von Kurt Schwitters</i> (Bonn: Bouvier, 1978). For Anglophone scholarship dealing with Schwitters's literary output, see E.S.

<p><a name="FOOT3" href="#REF3">3</a>. There is no established distinction between the terms montage and collage, which are often used interchangeably. Marjorie Perloff notes that collage generally connotes static visual practices, while montage refers to practices that develop in time, most notably film. Perloff, "Collage and Poetry," <i>Encyclopedia of Aesthetics</i>, vol. 1, ed. Michael Kelly (New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press), 384–87, here 385. Historically, the term montage gained currency in conjunction with film theory. The Berlin Dadaists prized the term also for its affinity to the world of the factory and machine production, as witnessed by John Heartfield's nickname as "Monteur," which in German means mechanic or engineer. This is a very different semantic field from that of the French 'collage,' whose metaphorical reference to an illicit, extramarital relation situates its transgression squarely within the field of bourgeois morality. In this article, the term montage will be used as denoting a broad aesthetic principle of combination and juxtaposition. This principle encompasses a variety of practices ranging from verbal and visual collage, sculptural assemblage, and photomontage. For a discussion of collage in the context of the historical avant-garde see Perloff's "The Invention of Collage," <i>The Futurist Moment: Avant-Garde, Avant Guerre, and the Language of Rupture</i>, second edition (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2003), 42–79; and Christine Poggi, <i>In Defiance of Painting: Cubism, Futurism, and the Invention of Collage</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992); for an historical overview of the development of collage and montage practices in Western art see Brandon Taylor, <i>Collage: TheMaking of Modern Art</i> (New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004). </p>

<p><a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>. Schwitters used <i>Merz</i> as a modifier connoting the common principle underlying the wide range of artistic practices in which he engaged: <i>Merz</i> poetry, <i>Merz</i> sculpture, <i>Merz</i> stage, <i>Merz</i> architecture. The term first appears as a word fragment in a collage from 1919 that is known today from photographic reproductions of the original, which counts as lost. Schwitters's use of the term grew increasingly infrequent in the 1930s, in part because it had been forged as part of his contentious engagement with Dada, which made it a relic of past battles. Because the relative eclipse of the term does not reflect a change in direction in Schwitters's discourse on art, I deploy it as a general concept for discussing Schwitters's practice of abstract montage. </p>

Greenberg's analysis foregrounds the layered play with illusionistic representation that is made possible by Picasso's and Braque's incorporation of trompe l'oeil elements in their collages. Rosalind Krauss builds on Greenberg's argument in her important essay on Picasso's collage practice, which she describes as effecting "the representation of representation;" Rosalind Krauss, "In the Name of Picasso," <i>The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1985), 37.

<p><a name="FOOT18" href="#REF18">18</a>. Over the years, Schwitters's literary output moves away from the radical linguistic experimentation tied to Expressionism and Dadaism and towards more conventional stylistic and rhetorical strategies. As Friedhelm Lach notes, the early prose texts, so distinctively shaped by montage inserts, puns, and sound games, give way to more conventional narratives tailored after the genres of the parable and the fairy tale (<i>LW</i> 2, 7–11). It is however significant that Schwitters never completely gave up collage poetry, as evidenced by the late poems he composed in England. </p>

<div class="fn">
<p><a name="FOOT20" href="#REF20">20</a>. This is a strategy Schwitters adopts very deliberately, as he makes clear in a polemical essay from 1920, "Berliner BörsenKukukunst," where he claims the right to recycle just any material for his <i>Merz</i> compositions, including the critic himself. In the text's final section he humorously juxtaposes his own abstract "use" of the critic Kurt Glaser, which qualifies as 'real' art, to a more conventional, mimetic portrayal of the critic. <i>LW</i> 5, 51. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT24" href="#REF24">24</a>. The text unfolds as a multivalent parody of a love poem, mocking but also embracing the Western lyric tradition that celebrates erotic experience as an ecstatic moment of subversive unboundedness while also domesticating it through sentimental discourse so as to render it morally palatable. Scheffer notes that materials from the poem return under different guises in more than forty texts (<i>Anfänge experimenteller Literatur,</i> 45). Indeed, Schwitters recycled Anna Blume as a conceptual image, a linguistic pun, an emblem of poetic practice, and an ideogram in visual compositions. For the rhetorical and formal strategies that animate the text, as well as an overview of its reception in Germany from its original publication to the 1970s, see Scheffer, 74–90.

Drawing on the readings of Wittgenstein's later philosophy developed by Jacques Bouveresse and Stanley Cavell, Perloff highlights the social and cultural basis of the modes of communication connoted by the concept of the language game, what Wittgenstein elliptically alludes to as "forms of life." As Perloff notes in discussing an excerpt from a 1932 Cambridge lecture, "the language game [ . . . ] is neither a genre nor even a particular form of discourse; rather, it is a paradigm, a set of sentences, let us say, selected from the language we actually use so as to describe how communication of meaning works in specific circumstances" (<i>Wittgenstein's Ladder,</i> 60). For Wittgenstein's discussion of the ways meaning is engendered and traded through the varied modes of behavior he terms language games, see especially #23–#54 in the <i>Philosophical Investigations,</i> trans.

In this context, see Henry Staten's discussion of the status of the rules that govern the language games in <i>Wittgenstein and Derrida</i> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1984). Staten analyzes the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> as a deconstructive inquiry into philosophical method that questions the assumption of presence and essentially given meaning presumably guaranteed by self–identical forms. This leads him to emphasize the utterly singular status of the rules that enable the language games. As he notes, rules in Wittgenstein's understanding of language do not function as an a-temporal, universally shared system of coordinates that is instantiated in particular cases. This is because Wittgenstein's understanding of rules does away with the assumption of a "self-identical form that marks their boundaries and makes their varying manifestations instances of the same. Wittgenstein's account runs counter to those views that see human activities as structured by 'implicit rules'; for him the actual instances of usage are our 'rules.' The instances of usage are spatiotemporal phenomena, and are to be 'applied' to the understanding of new cases, not as a rule conceived as logos or intelligible

<p id="lead">Robert Frost's "Design" is a poem about interpretation. The sonnet's speaker finds a white spider eating a white moth on an unnaturally white flower. The sheer unlikelihood of this event leads him to ask what the meaning of it could be and, more fundamentally, whether the question of meaning is appropriate at all. The final line—"If design govern in a thing so small."—is, despite its period, not a declaration but a double question. Question one: Is there design in the natural world? Question two: If there is, then what? Does natural design mean anything? These questions—What am I looking at, why is it there, and what might it mean?—are, of course, basic to literary interpretation. "A thing so small," thus, refers to the poem "Design" as well as the spider's meal. What makes Frost's poem remain challenging even today is the way it brings the literary and the natural together.  </p>

<p>In "Design" and his thinking about literary form, especially meter, Frost displays a remarkably prescient sense of the ways science and literature would move closer to each other as the twentieth century went on. When Richard Poirier revealed the legacy of William James and his response to Darwin in the poem, he did not appreciate just how profoundly Frost grasped the impact of Darwin's ideas on how we understand order, intention, and meaning.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Frost was nowhere more ahead of his time than in his understanding of one of English literature's oldest and most dominant conventions, iambic pentameter. Frost's conscious awareness, rather than intuitive sense, of the role meter plays in verse and how it does so anticipates generative metrics' account of iambic pentameter. Generative metrics also brings together science and literature, drawing on the insights of contemporary 

<b></b>

linguistics, especially in the field of phonology, in order to develop a universal grammar of metrical verse forms. Generative metrics suggests that literature is, at least at the level of its sonic material, an outgrowth of nature. Frost's "Design" asks if nature can be treated as a text, i.e., read and interpreted. This paper moves in the opposite direction; it asks if texts can be naturalized—described as possessing innate form—by examining the meter of "Design." </p>

<p>"Design" is a particularly apt subject because meter plays an important role in it, especially in the final line, where Frost poses his fundamental questions about natural and literary order. I will be using generative metrics to scan and interpret the poem. In doing so, I hope to introduce generative metrics to readers unfamiliar with it and convince them of its superiority to traditional scansion, not only for Frost but for all metrical verse. The best defense of the method will be a richer reading of "Design," one that shows how the oft-missed metrical event in the final line matters. Readers of poetry, unfortunately, too often treat meter as "a thing so small." The reasons for this neglect are not unrelated to "Design." Many students of poetry, hobbled by the unwieldy and uninformative apparatus of classical Greek prosody, struggle first even to discover the meter in a line of verse; worse, once they've done so, many are left asking, "Now what?" It is hard to find order, harder yet to find meaning. Much of the focus of this paper will be on the final line of "Design" and, more specifically, on the word "design" in the line; from a thing so small as where a word-stress falls in the meter of one line, Frost manages to make large claims about nature, matter, order, intention, and meaning. </p>

<p>First published in 1922, Robert Frost's "Design" would seem to flaunt its insignificance in comparison to the much larger and far more radical works associated with that iconic year—T. S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i> and James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>. The poem's reference, in its final line, to "a thing so small" is intended to hold a mirror up to itself. The poem is small in size (a sonnet), in subject matter (a spider's eating of a moth on a mutated flower), and, it may seem, in ambition. What "Design" shares with <i>The Waste Land</i> and <i>Ulysses</i> is an anxiety over the source of order and meaning; the question, at its most basic, is are they made or found? The debate between idealism and realism is ancient, but it gained energy on both sides at the turn of the century with the enormous growth of capitalism's ability to commodify reality and with advances in the natural and physical sciences, which at once seemed to penetrate deeper into the truth of the universe and to make that truth more abstract and mysterious. As science and commerce despiritualize every corner of modern life, how is one to find or create meaning? Indeed is meaning to be found, or is it created by artists? </p>

<p>In "<i>Ulysses</i>, Order, and Myth," Eliot took the latter position, arguing that modernist art must stop emulating the "mummified stuff from a museum" and invent new forms of representation as a "way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a 

<b></b>

significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Eliot claimed that the mythic method of <i>Ulysses</i> had "the importance of a scientific discovery" and he often displayed a fondness for scientific terms in his criticism, but he was interested in science more as a source for metaphors than as a method for discovering the world's order . This lip service to science, as Timothy Steele has suggested in his study of the modernists' rejection of metrical verse, was common among the high modernists, who often enough misunderstood the science they drew on in their critical writing.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Frost, on the other hand, took science, particularly Darwin, very seriously, as Robert Faggen has shown.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The major contribution Darwin's work made to Frost's thought was that it forced him to think hard about the paradox that as humanity grew more intellectually and culturally sophisticated, the distance between it and nature shrank rather than grew. We might be nature's most creative inventors, but we are also nature's most creative invention. While the rest of the world fretted about how far away we were from the natural world, an anxiety that came to a head three years after "Design" was published, in the Scopes monkey trial, Frost realized that Darwin's really radical idea was that nature was not so far away from us. It can design incredible worlds of order and do so without any intelligence or spirit at all. This idea—not only that the material world possesses order but also that it can create it—made Darwin the most dangerous of all materialists. Frost realized early on that evolution mattered for modern artists and thinkers mainly as a question of design.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>"Design" is not wholly a product of 1922; the poem began life circa 1912 as "In White." Frost made several significant revisions to the poem, none more meaningful than his rewriting of the final line, which originally read, "Design, design! Do I use the word aright" ? While the ending of "Design" is superior to this conclusion, it is unfortunate that we lost the line because it gave voice to an anxiety raised by the advent of modern science, exacerbated by Darwin, and still troubling contemporary culture. </p>

<p>So what is Frost asking here? As indicated by his repetition of the word, he is worrying about the relation between the two most commonly used senses of the noun "design," here summarized from the Oxford English Dictionary.  </p>

	 

	<ol class="uroman">
	
 	<li>A mental plan
	
<ol>

<li>	A plan or scheme conceived in the mind and intended for subsequent execution </li> 

<li>In weaker sense: Purpose, aim, intention  </li></ol>
</li>
<li> 	A plan in art 

<ol>
	<li>A preliminary sketch for a picture or other work of art; the plan of a building or any part of it, or the outline of a piece of decorative work.

<b></b></li>

	<li>The combination of artistic details or architectural features which go to make up a picture, statue, building, etc.; the artistic idea as executed.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>   </li>
	</ol></li></ol>
 

<p class="continued">
The noun "design" designates a mental plan or intention and a physical plan or formal order. In the very word itself, we observe the split between idealism and materialism. Design designates both interiority and exteriority, priority and posterity. Modern French goes to the trouble to distinguish between these two senses, with the first sense (hereafter D1) translated <i>dessein</i> and the second sense (D2) <i>dessin</i> (<i>OED Online</i>). Frost's dilemma in "In White" and "Design" is not so much to decipher the meaning of the design laid out before him, but to decide whether D2 (artfully laid out form) indicates D1 (an intention and, thus, an intender) or whether D2 can exist without D1.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Frost is essentially rehearsing the Argument from Design, which predates the Enlightenment but became prominent then as a way to bring science and theology into accord. It relied on and reinforced the identification between order (D2) and intention (D1), through an exercise somewhat akin to what is known today as reverse engineering—taking the end result and working backward to the cause. The philosopher Daniel Dennett has laid out the structure of the Argument from Design in his Cosmic Pyramid: </p>



<div class="center">
<span style="font-size: .75em">GOD</span> 
<br />
<span style="font-size: .85em">MIND </span> 
<br />
<span style="font-size: .95em">DESIGN </span> 
<br />
<span style="font-size: 1.25em">ORDER </span> 
<br />
<span style="font-size: 1.55em">CHAOS </span> 
<br />
<span style="font-size: 1.75em">NOTHING</span> <sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
</div>	<!--CLOSE indent-->




<p class="continued">The Cosmic Pyramid mirrors not only the hierarchy of being, from the top down, but also the path that the rational believer follows up to God. </p>

<p>But then Darwin came along and revealed the fundamental error of the Argument from Design. The move from order to design is fine, but mind is a non sequitur. It was Darwin's discovery of Natural Selection that made it no longer necessary to go from the wonderful, even seemingly intelligent design of the world to an intelligent designer. Natural Selection explains the creation of immensely sophisticated order through, as Dennett puts it, "nothing but a set of individually mindless steps succeeding each other without the help of any intelligent supervision" . "Darwin's dangerous idea," Dennett explains, "is that Design can emerge from mere Order via an algorithmic process that makes no use of pre-existing Mind" . This algorithmic process, in which traits that are useful for the survival of a species are preserved by passing them onto offspring (i.e. Natural Selection), is so powerful that it presents the illusion of a guiding force, an Intelligence, in Nature. Dennett points out, however, that Darwin and his intellectual descendents showed "this Intelligence could be broken into bits so tiny and stupid that they didn't count as intelligence at all, and then distributed through space and time in a gigantic, connected network of algorithmic process. The work [of designing new forms of order] must get done, but which work gets done is largely a matter of chance" . 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Darwin's dangerous idea has garnered less than universal support. Even within the world of science, the adaptationist program continues to be put into question, most famously by Stephen Jay Gould, but also by Noam Chomsky, who along with other linguists, has engaged Steven Pinker and others in a debate over the evolutionary status of language. Frost himself had reservations over Darwin, but he realized that after <i>Origin of Species</i> the Argument from Design was as dead as the dodo. "Design," as the product of that realization, puts not one, not two, but three nails in its coffin. </p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Let's start at the beginning, by briefly recapitulating the drama of "Design." <br />

Assorted characters of death and blight  <br />

<p class="continued">An observer, perhaps during his morning constitutional, discovers a white spider (a fairly common color for the type of spider, most likely a crab spider [<i>Thomisidae</i>], which is able, in some cases, to change color and which lays in wait on flowers to eat, among other things, moths) eating a white moth (a common enough color for moths) on a white heal-all (an unusual color for a heal-all). Heal-alls are naturally blue or purple, so this one is a mutation [<a href="#1">re 1</a>]. Our observer finds this highly improbable scene, this image seemingly sprung from the palette of Jasper Johns, and ultimately asks, "What but design of darkness to appall" could have designed such a thing . This is the poem's first attack on the Argument from Design: if the Argument takes itself and the world seriously, then it can only lead to the conclusion that God is evil and Christian theology is a sham. An evil design could only indicate an evil designer.  </p>

IV. Demolishing the Argument from Design, Version 2
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Frost did not stop there. He did not stop the poem or his attack on the Argument from Design in the <i>reductio ad malum</i> of line 13.  The poem's final line demolishes not only the Argument from Design but also its own first attack. "If design govern in a thing 

<b></b>

so small" suggests that the whole drama we've just witnessed might be as misguided as the original Argument from Design, because there <i>is</i> no design in a thing so small as this scene . The first attack suggests that natural theology followed to its end could only conclude with an evil deity; the second attack suggests that a theological mindset that purports to discover a creator behind creation is wrongheaded no matter how it imagines that creator. The design perceived there is a construct of the observing mind, not of some malevolent designer. Design does not exist out there; it is only in human minds and the forms they project on nature. The final line suggests that the outside-in movement of the poem, from observing D2—order—to inferring D1—intention—is in truth always the reverse. Our designing minds impose design on the essential chaos of the world. What is especially important to see here is that this charge followed through indicts science as much as it does theology. Pure science claims to discover order in the world; art to make it. The skepticism of the final line of "Design" would seem to suggest that science is really just a deluded form of art.</p>

<p>Frost's use of the sonnet form in this poem would seem particularly apt in light of this second critique of the Argument from Design. After all, isn't the sonnet a perfect example of the artificial order humans lay over the world? If most poets go to the form to tame the chaos of romantic passion, Frost much more frequently uses the sonnet to write about nature. Frost published 29 sonnets in his lifetime; all but two—"Unharvested," which veers back and forth between pentameter and tetrameter, and "Mowing," 

<b></b>

which stands out for being unmetrical— employ strict iambic pentameter (see <a href="#app">appendix</a>). Frost was much looser in the rest of his verse, as if in his sonnets he was submitting himself to the restrictions of the form in order to impose a design on the world's disorder. If there is any order in a thing so small as the scene in "Design," it is there because a thing as small as a sonnet governs it all. Nature takes its cues from art, not art from nature. </p>

<p>This argument should be recognizable. It recalls Eliot's description of the mythic method as "a way . . . of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance." Note the verbs. Joyce's method does not <i>discover</i> an order or shape; it <i>orders</i>, it <i>gives</i> shape. The focus for the high modernists was on breaking the old forms and creating new ones more adequate to modernity. Chief among the worn-out forms was metrical verse. Looking back at the Teens, Pound gave this overthrow pride of place: "To break the pentameter, that was the first heave."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  He told poets "to compose in the sequence of a musical phrase, not in the sequence of a metronome."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   The influential critic T. E. Hulme declared, "[R]egular meter . . . is cramping, jangling, meaningless, and out of place."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Frost, however, should not be included in this camp of idealist iconoclasts. He lived in England from 1912–15 and knew Pound and Hulme firsthand. He did not fall under their spell. On the contrary, he began work on the poem that would become "Design" and developed a theory of poetic practice that placed a heavy emphasis on the significance of sound and meter. Tyler Hoffman suggests that Frost's theorizing while he was in London "was a way to help secure a share of the literary marketplace for himself," but I would add that it was also a genuine response to and repudiation of high modernist ideas about meter, matter, and meaning.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
V. Frost's (Generative) Metrics
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Most readings of "Design" stop with Frost the skeptical modernist doubting the reality of design.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  This is a mistake. Frost was no idealist; he believed that order existed out there, in the natural world, only he found it in an unusual place. Design exists in nature for Frost, and it exists in phonology.  </p>

<p>Rarely taken seriously as a literary theorist, Frost came up with one big idea, developed in 1913 in London, where every poet seemed to have his own philosophy of literature, and he trumpeted this idea to anyone who would listen for the rest of his career. This idea was the concept of "the sound of sense," a phenomenon he also described as "sentence sounds," since it was only in sentences that the sound of sense emerged. The sound of sense, Frost wrote, "is the abstract vitality of our speech. It is pure sound—pure form."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The poet, he argued, must be able to perceive this form <i>and</i> raise it to the level of awareness through his craft. Consider the following comments. </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[I]f one is to be a poet he must learn to get cadences by skillfully breaking the sounds of sense with all their irregularity of accent across the regular beat of the metre.

<p class="continued">

Frost's description of verse matching up meter and speech rhythms, we shall see, bears great similarity to generative metrics' description of metrical forms. Most striking is his conscious awareness, rather than creative intuition, that what really matters in meter are the natural stresses of polysyllabic words. Frost also anticipates generative metric's account of the foundations of meters. Poetic conventions, although the product of cultural rather than natural evolution, do not, Frost insists, impose order on nature. They highlight it. Here is Frost again. </p>

<p>It is hard to say whether Frost's reference to the cave of the mouth sounds more like Plato or Chomsky here. I want to suggest that he sounds most like Darwin. Frost saw himself as more a discoverer like Darwin than a creator like Eliot and Joyce, a scientist as much as an artist. Poetry summons the sounds of sense rather than creating them. It is to science that we now turn, to generative metrics, in order to see what it means to drag the accents of language across the meter and to see what happened when Frost did so in "Design." </p>

<p>Generative metrics, first developed by Morris Halle and Samuel J. Keyser and later modified by Paul Kiparsky and Kristin Hanson, is probably unfamiliar to most of my readers, despite the fact that it has been around since the mid-Sixties.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  I suggest that the major reasons this linguistic description of meter has not supplanted the traditional scansion based on description of feet are a lack of familiarity with the science of linguistics and, more significant, a broader suspicion of all science. While theories of Universal Grammar and the innate structure of language do remain issues of debate within linguistics, the mere words "universal" and "innate" are enough to raise the hackles of many English professors and graduate students. The dilemma in "Design" is very much the dilemma facing both linguists and literary critics—what to make of order in the world and the text? Is it there? And if it is, does it mean anything? In other words, the status of generative metrics is not unrelated to the current status of Frost, "Design," and metrical verse. A better understanding of generative metrics will help us read "Design"; a better reading of "Design" will help us understand the significance of generative metrics.  </p>

<p>Generative metrics suggests that traditional metrical verse forms might indeed be much more natural than we have thought them to be.  Meter is not, in Wimsatt and 

<b></b>

Beardsley's phrase, "an exercise in abstraction," not completely.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The insights of linguistics, particularly studies of rhythm and phonology, suggest that the iambic pentameter line, while indubitably the product of cultural history, achieved its near hegemonic position in English verse from the Renaissance through the nineteenth century because it was a good fit for the natural structures of English. Hanson claims </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[T]he major metrical systems of modern English and the systematic variations in form within them . . . can all be understood as stylizations of exactly [the] set of objects and operations which constitutes the universal grammar of linguistic rhythm. Specific phenomena which are commonly identified with metrical structure . . . all in fact have counterparts in phonological structure itself. Thus, the creation and perception of meter itself as an artistic form has its basis in the natural world, just as architecture does in petrology.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In other words, formalism and materialism need not be mere metaphors in literary criticism; linguistics has discovered a great deal about the form poetry's sonic material naturally takes. </p>

<p>The linguist Bruce Hayes has done invaluable cross-linguistic work on metrical stress theory that has revealed the correspondences between the natural elements of phonology and the putatively cultural elements of poetic meter. For example, Hayes finds that languages that employ stress contain properties similar to metrical verse, such as rhythmic distribution ("Syllables bearing equal levels of stress tend to occur spaces at roughly equal distances, falling into alternate patterns.") and stress hierarchies ("[M]ost stress languages have multiple degrees of stress.").<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Hayes also suggests that the grouping we perform in scansion naturally occurs in language use. The work of turn of the century psychologists on the perception of sound duration and intensity lead him to propose the Iambic/Trochaic Law: </p>

<ol>
 <li>	Elements contrasting in intensity naturally form groupings with initial prominence</li>
 <li>	Elements contrasting in duration naturally form groupings with final prominence.	 </li>
</ol>
 

 

<p class="continued">In other words, in a sequence of alternating loud and soft sounds, the hearer naturally perceives them in LOUDsoft groupings, a trochaic pattern of initial prominence. When the alternation is long-short, the grouping becomes iambic—shortL-O-N-G—in its prominence pattern. Finally, linguistics has shown that many languages display a phonological structure that groups syllables into feet. The most amusing, if not the best, evidence for the existence and significance of phonological feet is John J. McCarthy's account of expletive infixation in English. McCarthy argues that the reason we say "fan-fuckin'-tastic" rather than "fanta-fuckin'-stic" is that we naturally insert expletives between phonological foot boundaries.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  These phonological feet are not equivalent to metrical feet; their existence however suggests that metrical feet might be, as Hanson suggests, stylizations of naturally occurring material rather than structures sprung from the mind of man, untouched by nature. Traditional metrical forms might be much more the product of nature, while free verse might be the extreme end of cultural 

<b></b>

expression. In the light of generative metrics and <i>conta</i> Hegel, the poet looks much more like a painter working with the limitations of pigment or a sculptor with marble than he does some kind of ethereal being shaping pure spirit.  </p>

<p>Generative metrics builds on these and other linguistic insights into the working of language in order to articulate a description of meter that can capture poets' intuitive knowledge of iambic pentameter and can distinguish lines that conform to that meter from those that don't. One of the major weaknesses of traditional scansion is that it cannot really be used to define a meter at all; as Derek Attridge points out, it can scan any strand of prose as "a succession of classical feet" without explaining why one line would be metrical and another, say, this sentence, would not.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Like the speaker in "Design," the analyst using traditional metrics can say what he sees, but he will not be able to say why it is that way. An adequate analysis of any line's meter entails examining it against a template and the correspondence rules that govern the mapping of any line into the template.  </p>

<p>The template of iambic pentameter is as follows. </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>ws ws ws ws ws</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This model corresponds to a large degree with traditional descriptions of iambic pentameter. There are ten positions, organized into binary units of feet, and each foot has a rising pattern, composed of a weak position (w) and a strong one (s). So far we are not very far from the traditional "taTUM taTUM taTUM taTUM taTUM" description of iambic pentameter. The differences appear in the correspondence rules: </p>

<ol>
 <li>	Each metrical position typically contains one syllable.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Additional rhythmically weak syllables can be added to the right edge of feet, a phenomenon traditionally know as a feminine ending; these extrametrical syllables most commonly come at the end of the line. Weak positions at the left edge of lines or phrases may be left empty, a phenomenon known as catalexis.</li> 
<li> No weak position (w) contains the primary stressed syllable of a polysyllabic, lexical word, unless that syllable falls line- or phrase-initially.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> </li> 
 </ol>

<p class="continued">What should be noted here it that the rules put no restrictions on strong positions (s), monosyllabic words, or non-lexical words. Poems conventionally identified as written in iambic pentameter routinely place unstressed syllables in (s) positions and stressed ones in (w) positions.  </p>

<p class="continued">With only one exception, line 14, "Design" maps cleanly into the template. Each position contains one syllable, and strongly-stressed syllables of polysyllabic words are in the (s) position. Lines 6, 7, and 9 could be read as having eleven syllables, and in neither case could the final, stressed syllables be counted as extrametrical. These lines contain elisions. The final two syllables of "ingredients" are elided as one syllable, a perfectly conventional pronunciation, while the two syllables of "flower" are elided, so it sounds like "flour," again a pronunciation licensed by ordinary speech. "Heal-all" in line 10 would appear to violate the second correspondence rule by placing "heal" in a weak position, especially since compound words tend to have initial stress (e.g. "doghouse," "girlfriend"), but as Halle and Keyser have pointed out, Frost often treats compound and hyphenated words in particular as two monosyllabic words (presuming the compound is composed of two monosyllables), and Kiparsky has provided a phonological basis for this practice.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  "Heal" can be treated as a monosyllabic word and thus presents no problem for rule two. The only real complication in the poem, the placement of the word "design" in line fourteen so that the second, stressed syllable falls in a (w) position (contrast it with the placement of the same word in line thirteen), is not so easily dismissed. It is essential to an interpretation of how the meter of "Design" contributes to the poem's meaning.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The metrical regularity of the opening lines of the poem is entirely appropriate; if we can make an equation between nature and the natural properties of English, as I think we can in "Design," then Frost has it that our initial encounter with the poem is much like the speaker's discovery of the natural scene. We find the language in perfect harmony with meter's design. When "Design" begins to complicate the template of iambic pentameter with the eleven syllables of line 6, it slightly disturbs this vision and sound of order, but only to reinstate them more forcefully as the elision of "ingredients" brings the line back in line. This elision echoes the blending in the witches' broth, in which discrete components come together in a unity, much as the spider, flower, and moth have in the poem. The elisions in lines 7 and 9 place "flower" in a weak position and a strong position, respectively; a similar phenomenon occurs with "heal-all." It is as if Frost is showing off his ability to arrange language within the constraints of iambic pentameter.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  In 2, "heal-all" spans two feet, in 10, only one. The same thing happens with "design" in 13 and 14. While Frost might doubt that something steered the spider, moth, and flower together, he leaves us no doubt as to <i>his</i> ability to steer these "assorted characters" into varied but ordered arrangements. It is this ability to "sort" words that Frost once described as essential to poets. "Our technique becomes as much material as material itself. . . . In poetry and under emotion every word used is 'moved' a little or much—moved from its old place, heightened, made, made new."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>   </p>

VI. Demolishing the Argument from Design, Version 3
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Nowhere in "Design" is Frost's movement of words more significant than in the final line. Instead of displaying his ability to work within the constraints of iambic pentameter, Frost breaks the meter, breaks the poem's design, and he does so with the word "design." This is the only line in the poem that cannot be accommodated to the template. Indeed, it is the only line in any of Frost's pentameter sonnets that cannot be (see <a href="#app">appendix</a>). The first and second syllables of "design" fall into the strong and weak position, respectively, which violates the correspondence rule that states that the most strongly stressed syllable of a polysyllabic lexical word will never fall into a weak position, save for those exceptions in line- and phrase-initial positions.  </p>

<p class="continued">Once again, form echoes content, as this disruption of order happens in a line that seems to be questioning whether design does indeed govern in a thing so small as a spider's meal, a sonnet, or even a single line or word of a poem. Design, it would appear, is <i>not</i> governing the word "design" itself. The word slips out of the constraints of iambic pentameter.  </p>

<p>I hope it is clear that Frost is making a bit of a joke here, but it's not one that's been heard often. The only critic I know of who has picked up on the meter of the last line is Reuben Brower, but he sees it as a further reason to doubt the reality of any design 

<b></b>

at all. This interpretation, I suggest, highlights the limits of foot-based analysis of meter. When it hasn't made readers deaf to the metrical-semantic effect of Frost's final line, traditional scansion has, as in Brower's case, led them to misread the line. For it is precisely in this joke—that "design" itself is not subject to the poem's design—that the modernist/idealist's argument against design breaks down, and breaks down as a result of the breakdown of the metrical template of the poem. While the idealist might claim that this collapse of design only proves his point that minds impose design on the world, such a claim misses the much more important point that this collapse is precipitated by the mismatch of the meter and the natural stress of the word "design." "Design" is naturally accorded sonic prominence in the poem because it is a lexical word and because its second syllable contains a long vowel sound, but Frost puts that prominence into tension with the meter. Frost's breaking the meter can only happen (for both writer and reader) as a result of taking into account aspects of language—the placement of stress on certain categories of words and of vowels—that cannot be willed by individuals or cultures. Individuals can choose to place extra emphasis on certain words in their readings of the poem, of course, but this action exploits natural stress patterns; it doesn't prove their falsehood. What would emphasis mean if there were not some established pattern for it to be played against? Frost's joke in line 14 is in part that a break from order is the best proof of order's presence. </p>

<p>Biology and linguistics strike back at both culture and religion here, as nature is revealed to be designed but not by any designer, not unless God prefers long vowels and verbs. But Frost isn't done yet. I suggest that Frost's interest in a thing so small as the stress pattern of a word and his exercise in building up and demolishing arguments in order to create new ones are analogues to the phenomenon evolutionary biologists call scaling. Scaling refers to the repetition of the phenomenon of Natural Selection at each level of scale in the process of evolution, from strands of DNA up to species and perhaps beyond, if you believe Richard Dawkins argument about memes, all the way up to culture. What happens with the word "design" in line 14 recapitulates what happens in evolution: the appearance of disorder is recuperated into a new system of order, one with greater complexity. The apparent breakdown of design ends up revealing the insistence of design. </p>

<p>We can find this recuperation of order in two places. Hanson has discovered, in Donne's verse and Shakespeare's dramas, lines that extend the second correspondence rule, lines that allow stressed syllables to appear in weak positions as long as they are subordinated to a following stronger stress.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The placement of "design" next to the stronger stress of the first syllable "govern" would be allowed, and it has an interesting semantic effect. "Design" is subordinated, appropriately, to "govern." The more strongly stressed word does what it means, a perfect illustration of Frost's definition of poetry: "words that have become deeds."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  This, then, is one answer to Frost's query: yes, design does govern in a thing this small because the break with design is only an illusion. Culture—in the form of a sonnet—and nature—in the sounds of words—match up quite nicely, perhaps because culture, even in a thing as small as an iambic pentameter line, is much more the product of nature that we've thought it to be. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>We can also place this recuperation at the level of meaning. The disturbance of order at the metrical level contributes to a greater degree of semantic complexity, as we recognize that Frost has played a little joke here. It is he who has placed "design" out of whack with the template, but he did so intentionally. What looks like a loss of control over the poem's design (D2—plan) is in fact the moment in which Frost's design (D1—intention) is most insistent. What is particularly striking about this moment in the poem is that the sense of the poem's meaning is enriched by the perception of a disturbance of order, in stark contrast to the scenario depicted in the poem, where the speaker asks what the scene means because it is so well arranged. Earlier I suggested that one of the main questions asked by Frost in this poem and by many people today is whether order (D2) implies intention (D1); in "Design" the collapse of D2 leads to the inference of D1. We can begin to see in this reversal the difference between nature and literature. With the natural object, the question is could this concurrence be meaningful? With a text, the question is could it not? </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
VIII. The Order and Meaning of Meter
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>In this final line of the poem, even as the poem's structure mimics the operation of evolution (order rising out of disorder) and employs a meter that Frost understands more to be given by nature than crafted by humans, Frost makes a sharp distinction between culture and nature, between text and tree. In this poem (in any poem) we <i>do</i> have a designer, and it was he, not nature, that placed "design" next to "govern." We even have a record of his designing intelligence at work in the manuscript evidence of his revision of "In White," a revision that is of course much more interesting in terms of meter. And as a result, the poem, unlike the spider's repast, definitely has a meaning. In literature, order does mean meaning; in nature, it does not, since meaning implies intention, and nature intends nothing.  </p>

<p>If nature, and I include meter within its embrace, has any design (D1) it is to achieve design (D2); this is true at least in the biological realm, where entropy must be kept at bay. Richard Dawkins has argued that "natural selection exerts a braking effect on evolution. The baseline rate of evolution, in the absence of natural selection, is the maximum possible rate.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  That is synonymous with the mutation rate." Literary forms do much the same thing; they place a brake on change and in doing so guide it into more interesting formulations. I can think of no better expression of this paradoxical relationship between constraints and creativity than the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam's: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>When I was a boy I felt the role of rhyme in poetry was to compel one to find the unobvious because of the necessity of finding a word which rhymes. This forces novel associations and almost guarantees deviations from routine chains or trains of thought. It becomes paradoxically a sort of automatic mechanism of originality.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">What Frost realized when he compared free verse to tennis without a net was that freedom without constraint easily devolves into chaos. Literary forms are not restrictions 

<b></b>

imposed on language, but structures designed as ways to explore the design space of a language and to find places undiscovered by earlier writers. In 1950, the geneticist H. Kalmus described a gene in much the same way that we might describe a literary text: "A gene . . . is a message, which can survive the death of the individual and can thus be received repeatedly by several organisms of different generations."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>   </p>

<p>I do not use these genetic/textual metaphors lightly; I would suggest that "Design" anticipates in both subject matter and tone this coming together of the biological and the linguistic that Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 enabled. It was during the Twenties, the decade in which "Design" was published, that scientists discovered DNA's composition, but it was Watson and Crick who revealed that the vast diversity of life could be reduced to chains of just 4 molecules that were red as letters—A (adenine), G (guanine), C (cytosine), and T (thymine)—and that much of that diversity came down to, almost literally, spelling, the way the molecules/letters were arranged. There are two shocking revelations here. First, great complexity arises from extreme simplicity. Two, nature possesses an order that looks a great deal like language's. These, I suggest, are exactly the revelations Frost delineates in "Design," and his poem responds to them in much the same way that people did and continue to do so to Watson and Crick's revelation of the material mechanisms of evolution: awe, horror, doubt. Just as the perversion of nature in "Design"—the naturally blue heal-all that has mutated into a white flower—is necessary to establish a new form of order in the natural scene, so too does the "perversion" of the meter in the poem's final line introduce a whole new level of design.  The meter of "Design" is not a repudiation of nature so much as a testimony to it. The poem anticipates the modern synthesis of evolution, while Frost's theory of meter anticipates modern linguistics. A few decades later Chomsky and other linguists would confirm Frost's intuition that language was an aspect of nature. </p>

<p>One of the main problems both religious people and humanists have with evolution and modern linguistics is its reduction of what seems magical in the world's beauty, multiplicity, diversity, and design to the repetition of materials that lack those qualities, that seem utterly mundane rather than magical. The difficulty generative metrics has had in gaining a foothold in literature departments can also, in part, be chalked up to this same resistance. Surely meter cannot be as simple as this; at least those classical names had an arcane, thaumaturgic charm to them. A commitment to traditional scansion might have something in common with a resistance to or lack of interest in prosody; they all are suspicious of scientific reductionism. What they miss is that reductionism does not limit art so much as it reveals the myriad ways it can take shape. Metrics is descriptive, not prescriptive. </p>

<p>This is not to say that literary interpretation is science or can be reduced to prosody. More than two decades ago, Paul de Man pointed out that literary formalism's error was to confuse intentional objects with natural ones. "Certain entities exist," namely natural objects, "the full meaning of which can be said to be equal to the totality of their sensory appearances. . . . But even the most purely intuitive consciousness could never conceive of the significance of an object such as . . . a chair, without including 

<b></b>

in the description an allusion to the <i>use</i> to which it is put."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  In other words, intention always matters if we are interested in an artifact's meaning. An interest in meaning is an interest in intention. The only correction I would make to de Man's formula is that natural objects can't be said to have <i>any</i> meaning, because they possess no intentional quality.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  What they may possess is order (D2), extremely sophisticated order, as in the scenario described in "Design," as in the natural stress properties of languages, as in iambic pentameter, but that order remains meaningless without intention (D1). It's worth keeping in mind that DNA is not interpreted; poems are. Confusing D1 with D2 is a temptation that materialism will continue to offer as it grows more and more powerful in its powers of description (witness Intelligent Design), but it is a temptation that needs to be resisted in order to see not only, for instance, what meter is but what it means. Ten years after publishing "Design," Frost argued that it was the coming together, not the confusion, of mind and matter that made poetry always something more than materialism and a poem always something more than nature. "It is the height of poetry, the height of all thinking, the height of all poetic thinking, [the] attempt to say matter in terms of spirit and spirit in terms of matter. . . . The only materialist . . . is the man who gets lost in his material without a gathering metaphor to throw it into shape and order."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  In "Design" the metaphor—of design's power over disorder—lives in the meter. </p>

Appendix: Iambic Pentameter in Frost's Sonnets
</h1>	<!--CLOSE app-head-->




<p>Frost published 29 sonnets during his lifetime. I have excluded two of them, "Mowing" and "Unharvested," since they conform only in line number to sonnet form. The chart below provides the title of each of the remaining 27 sonnets, its page number in <i>Frost: Collected Poems, Prose and Play</i>s; the number of regular iambic pentameter lines, the line of line-initial inversions, the number of elisions, the number of extrametrical syllables, and the number of lines that cannot be accounted for by these or the other two commonly allowed exceptions to the template—phrase-initial inversion and catalexis, neither of which appear in any of Frost's sonnets. What is striking in this chart is how many of Frost's lines map perfectly into regular iambic pentameter (84% of lines). More striking yet is the fact that line 14 of "Design" is the <i>only</i> line I've found in all of Frost's sonnets that cannot be accounted for by the template and its correspondence rules.

Paul Kiparsky, in "Stress, syntax and meter," <i>Language</i> 51  576–616, and "The rhythmic structure of English verse," <i>Linguistic Inquiry</i> 8  189–247, made several valuable emendations to Halle and Keyser's description.  My own discussion of iambic pentameter draws on all these texts, which should be consulted for their much more thorough discussion of the linguistic theory and technical aspects of their descriptions of English rhythmic structures. </p>

<p>Was it right, I have been asked, for THE NEW AGE to allow "T. K. L." to "mimick" Mr. Pound's articles on Parisian writers while these were still being published? My own answer is, Yes, and with more reasons than I can set down. Nobody, I suppose, thinks it odd that Mr. [Hilaire] Belloc should write in THE NEW AGE in criticism of the National Guilds System; and nobody will think it odd if the editorial exponents of that system reply either currently or at the conclusion of the series. Why, then, should it be thought strange to publish Mr. Pound's articles and subject them to criticism while they are still before our readers? . . . It will be found, if we all live long enough, that every part of THE NEW AGE hangs together; and that the literature we despise is associated with the economics we hate as the literature we love is associated with the form of society we would assist in creating. Mr. Pound—I say it with all respect—is the enemy of THE NEW AGE.</p>

<p>Although the <i>New Age</i> under A. R. Orage's editorship (1907–1922) has always been recognized as an important platform for modernist literature and art, scholars are currently taking more careful note of this British journal's very deliberate self-positioning in a public sphere that was, even by 1907, segmenting into multiple, and complexly interrelated, counterpublics. Funded by George Bernard Shaw and Lewis Wallace when Orage and Holbrook Jackson first took it over in 1907, the <i>New Age</i> quickly outgrew its Fabian Art League support and went on to promote 

<b></b>

 National Guild Socialism in the early 1910s, "a democratic alternative to the authoritarian tendencies" of collectivism that also distinguished itself from other socialisms in Britain at the turn of the twentieth century through its emphasis on the role that the arts play in any truly revolutionary agenda for social change.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  As first an "Independent Socialist Review of Politics, Literature, and Art" and then a "Weekly Review of Politics, Literature, and Art," the<i> New Age</i> distinguished itself from other political weeklies by covering literature and the arts as well as politics. But it also distinguished itself from both mainstream literary reviews and non-commercial little magazines such as <i>Blast</i> and the <i>Egoist</i>, with whom it shared numerous contributors, by devoting roughly half of any given issue (and the first half, at that) to political commentary. As a "political weekly that performed some functions traditionally associated with the literary review," it published a multiplicity of works by writers such as T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, F. T. Marinetti, and Ezra Pound.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Yet it published these writers side by side with articles challenging their work: visual and verbal parodies of modernist texts, artists, and manifestos; columns by the editor and other regular contributors questioning specific aesthetic precepts; and letters to the editor that continued debate about such concerns from one issue to the next.  </p>

<p>Because of its interest in staging open-ended exchanges about the social and aesthetic values of "modern" writing<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> —and its justification of this practice in terms of its commitment to staging similarly open-ended political debate, as Orage does in the November 1913 editorial excerpted above in the epigraph—the <i>New Age</i> offers a very different window onto the early-twentieth-century Anglo-American cultural scene than that afforded by the little magazines whose role in the production and dissemination of modernism was featured in the first several generations of bibliographic scholarship on modernism post-World War II, and is currently the focus of some very exciting new research in modern periodical studies.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Moreover, it offers a more richly heterogeneous record of early twentieth-century cultural debates about the arts than current scholarship on the pluralization of modernism is able to index.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  This essay focuses on two series of articles published in the fall of 1913 by Ezra Pound and Beatrice Hastings (Emily Alice Haigh) that exemplify the <i>New Age</i>'s willingness to both showcase and challenge avant-garde aesthetics during the pre-World War I heyday of "blasting and bombadiering."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Hastings was Orage's lover and the self-described shadow co-editor of the journal between 1907 and 1914. After a brief affair with Wyndham Lewis just before the outbreak of World War I, she left both London and Orage for Paris (and Amedeo Modigliani), where she assumed a new role for the journal as its Paris correspondent, writing for it weekly, for several more years, under the pseudonym of "Alice Morning," the last of thirteen known aliases she employed as a <i>New Age</i> contributor.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Although Orage himself is typically given full credit for "discovering" any number of soon-to-be-influential modernists, Hastings claims in her 1936 memoir that every creative writer "without exception" "who got a 'start' between summer, 1908, and May, 1914" in the <i>New Age</i> "owes that start to me and to no-one else." Orage, she also claims, dealt exclusively with manuscripts by "old hands and experts whose quality called for 

<b></b>

 no judgement." Furthermore, he "used poems for filling corners, and made few corners" for such work—while she herself "had entire charge of, and responsibility for, the literary direction of the paper, from reading and selection of MSS to the last detail of spacing and position."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Because the <i>New Age</i> archives were lost when its editorial offices were bombed during World War II, we cannot know whether Hastings' account of her control of the journal's "literary direction" is entirely trustworthy.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  It is undoubtedly the case, though, as I hope to show here through discussion of her publications in response to Ezra Pound under the pseudonyms "T. K. L." and "Alice Morning," that she played a key role in the critiques of the modernist avant-garde that the <i>New Age</i> staged during the pre-war period.  </p>

<p>The <i>New Age</i> under Orage's editorship prided itself on providing "some neutral ground where intelligences may meet on equal terms" in public debate about politics, literature, and the arts.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Indeed, it claimed a unique and privileged position within the periodical industry on the basis of this commitment to what we might now term Bakhtinian dialogics in the public sphere.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  And it was harshly critical of specialized and mono-vocal periodicals for failing to live up to its own high standards in this regard.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In the fall of 1913, however, the <i>New Age</i>'s own readers actually questioned the appropriateness of the journal's willingness to publish criticisms of Pound's work while featuring it, prompting the editor to defend the journal's policies in the November 1913 editorial that appears as the epigraph to this essay. These exchanges are a fascinating reminder of how sharply critical the <i>New Age</i> could be of the modernist avant-garde, especially when the latter was perceived to be excluding this magazine's readership—an audience that was predominantly <i>not</i> Oxbridge-educated or socially elite—from full participation in broad discussions of contemporary literature, art, and aesthetics.  </p>

<p>As Michael North has pointed out, we risk preserving modernism "in intellectual amber," retrospectively accomplishing "by critical consensus" modernism's "insulation from the cultural world into which it was introduced," unless we acknowledge its original simultaneity with other aesthetic practices, its first emergence as just that: an emergent rather than a dominant aesthetic mode or movement.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Two other key points of critical reference for this discussion are George Bornstein's argument in <i>Material Modernism: The Politics of the Page</i> about how recovering the original bibliographic and contextual codes of modernist texts can alter interpretations of these works and Mark Morrisson's claims in <i>The Public Face of Modernism: Little Magazines, Audiences, and Reception 1905–1920</i> about early British modernists' interest in renewing or engaging the public sphere in the early 1910s.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Guided by these and other recent contributions to the scholarship on Anglo-American modernism's early material history, I want to return to the fall of 1913, when Pound was a regular contributor to the <i>New Age</i>—and was regularly being pummeled by readers, other frequent contributors, and the journal's editorial staff for what would now be viewed as his classic modernist views on contemporary French poetry.  </p>

<p>This essay has three parts. The first section provides an overview of Pound's publications in the <i>New Age</i> between his first appearance in the journal in 1910 and the publication of the seven-part "Approach to Paris" series, which appeared between 4 

<b></b>

 September and 16 October 1913. The second focuses on the responses to Pound's work that Hastings published as "T. K. L." while his "Approach to Paris" series was still being published. Their critical duet—not quite <i>not</i> a conversation, yet one in which Pound ignores the existence of his interlocutor until long after both sets of articles had run their course—culminates a year and a half later in a flurry of letters to the editor in January 1915 in which <i>New Age</i> readers fall in line behind Hastings, writing now as "Alice Morning," in questioning Pound's valorization of difficulty. The final section looks at Pound's letters to the editor in response to these challenges, charting how his early praise for the journal's commitment to the staging of "critical heterogeneity in public discourse" shifts into a more condescending register toward readers who have failed to understand him; that is, failed to join him in the appreciation of the literature he promotes as <i>the</i> aesthetic of modernity (<i>PFM</i>, 13).  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
I. 	Ezra Pound in the <i>New Age</i>, 1910–1913
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>"Approach to Paris" is the fifth set of essays Pound published in the <i>New Age</i> following his first appearance in the journal in April 1910.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  In 1913 Pound was 28. Having arrived in London in 1908 with little more in his possession than copies of his first volume of verse, <i>A Lume Spento</i>, which had been "privately printed by an obscure Venetian publisher," Pound launched what T. S. Eliot would later refer to as his "siege" of the London literary world with a whirlwind of energy, quickly gaining the sponsorship of William Butler Yeats, Elkin Mathews, and Ford Madox Hueffer.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  During this phase of his career, Yeats's famous Monday evenings, Hueffer and Violet Hunt's salon, the Thursday meetings of the Poets' Club, and venues such as the G. K. Chesterton's Square Club, T. E. Hulme's Secession Club, the British Museum reading room, and the A. B. C. teashop across the street from the <i>New Age</i>'s Cursitor Street offices enabled Pound to move fluidly between the literary establishment and various avant-garde circles in bohemian London.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In the fall of 1913, he had not yet been introduced to T. S. Eliot by Conrad Aiken. Nor had he yet married Dorothy Shakespear—though his prospective mother-in-law, as Lawrence Rainey has noted, had informed him almost a year earlier of the minimum income it would take for him to support her daughter.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Moreover, he had not yet cut his ties either with establishment periodicals such as the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> and the <i>Quarterly Review</i> or with "mainstream critics like Edmund Gosse" and the "poets with respectable credentials" he had cultivated so carefully upon first arrival in London.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The latter would happen six months later, with the launching of the first issue of <i>Blast</i>.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>   </p>

<p>I am interested here in both assessing Pound's attraction to the <i>New Age</i> as a venue of publication during this early phase of his career and documenting key changes in his mode of address to its readership between 1910 and the fall of 1913. The <i>English Review</i> under Hueffer's editorship provided Pound with his first important avant-garde venue of publication in London when it published "Sestina: Altaforte" in June 1909 and "Three Poems" ("Ballad of the Goodly Fere," "Nils Lykke," and "Un Retrato") in 

<b></b>

 October of that same year.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Five canzoni also appeared there shortly after Austin Harrison replaced Heuffer as editor, three in January 1910 and two in April.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  By the fall of 1913, however, the <i>English Review</i> under Harrison's editorship had defaulted—quite successfully, as Mark Morrisson has noted—to featuring only "established" Edwardian writers, and the <i>New Age</i> had taken its place as the paper "which everybody who was anybody" was reading if they were interested in contemporary politics, literature, and the arts.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In 1913 Pound was also, of course, publishing in quite a range of other periodicals: mainstream British literary reviews, upstart little magazines on both sides of the Atlantic, "smart" American magazines featuring high- and lowbrow material in tandem, and British working-class papers reaching entirely different audiences than either of these other venues. The <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, for example, featured Pound's review of <i>The Poems of Rabindranath Tagore</i> in March 1913; the <i>Quarterly Review</i> printed a lengthy article on troubadour poetry in October. <i>Poetry</i> published "Imagisme," "In a Station in a Metro," and a dozen other poems of Pound's in March and April; the <i>New Freewoman</i> published "The Serious Artist" while the "Approach to Paris" series was running in the <i>New Age</i>. The <i>Smart Set</i> published "Portrait D'Une Femme" in November, just after "Approach to Paris" appeared in the <i>New Age</i>; <i>T. P.'s Weekly</i> had published "How I Began—By Ezra Pound, Poet and Critic: Author of 'Personae'" in June.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Arguably, though, the sheer number of Pound's contributions to the <i>New Age</i>, the size of its readership in comparison with that of the little magazines featuring his work, together with the "buzz" surrounding Orage and the <i>New Age</i> circle in the early 1910s make this magazine Pound's premiere venue of publication at this point in his career. It is important, in this regard, to consider carefully how he positions himself in relation to its distinctively heterogeneous readership.  </p>

<p>Pound's first major publications in the <i>New Age</i>, in 1911–12, were a set of essays entitled "I Gather the Limbs of Osiris" that introduced <i>New Age</i> readers to the Anglo-Saxon poem "The Seafarer" and the poetry of Guido Cavalcanti and Arnaut Daniel. Preceded only by a brief head note from the editor noting that "under this heading Mr. Pound will contribute expositions and translations in illustration of the 'New Method in Scholarship,'" Pound launches his exposition of critical methodology with the barest minimum of drum rolls.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Re-casting arguments published first in <i>The Spirit of Romance</i> , Pound rehearses for this audience the earlier volume's arguments about the advantages to be gained through broader dissemination of scholarly research as he explains why the "new" method of literary scholarship, which depends upon the presentation of "Luminous Detail," is preferable to both "the method of yesterday," with its focus on "sentiment and generalization," and the preferred scholarly mode of the present day, which Pound characterizes as a focus on "multitudinous detail."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>   </p>

<p>While the editor's introduction of Pound to the <i>New Age</i>'s readership is markedly minimalist, Pound himself is solicitous of his audience in this (to him) new venue of publication. His exposition of critical methodology is patient and careful, semi-apologetic even for its learnedness, as he establishes the importance of the troubadour traditions through which he charts the progress of poetry—and therefore of culture. "I Gather 

<b></b>

 the Limbs of Osiris" is remarkably free of the sense of disdain for the uneducated or miseducated general public that so often colors his later writings, and his translations of every line of verse quoted in its original language suggest a willingness to work <i>with</i> these readers, not frustration with the limits of their knowledge base. "[I]t is certain," he writes on 7 December 1911, "that we have had no 'greatest poet' and no 'great period' save at, or after, a time when many people were busy examining the media and the traditions of [poetry]" (<i>OII</i>, 13). His introduction to this series functions as an overture to <i>New Age</i> readers to count themselves among such a multitude.  </p>

<p>Pound's next publications for the <i>New Age</i> are three sets of essays on the state of the arts, of criticism about the arts, and the relationship of both to institutions of higher education and the periodical press in America: "Patria Mia" (September-November, 1912; eleven installments); "Through Alien Eyes" (January-February, 1913, four installments); and "America: Chances &amp; Remedies" (May-June, 1913, six installments).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Speaking from the vantage point of an American who has left the provincial hinterlands behind once and for all, Pound offers an assessment of the current American literary, cultural, and political scene that explains his reasons for choosing to live in London, while also hinting at his motivations as a contributor to the <i>New Age</i> in particular. Pound's argument in these essays is broadly expansive. Undoubtedly, his attention to the relationship between intellectual development in the arts and the traffic in ideas in the political and economic sphere would have appealed to readers of the <i>New Age</i> who were following the magazine's coverage of the political arguments between Independent Labour Party parliamentarians, trade union activists, Fabians, and National Guild Socialists about the adequacy of various collectivist solutions to the "problem of wage labor." Indeed, Pound's refusal to treat the arts as a separate sphere, distinct from and unrelated to the realm of politics and industry, both anticipates and echoes the arguments of A. J. Penty and other frequent <i>New Age</i> Guild Socialist contributors in the early 1910s about how a revival of the arts is a "necessary factor in social salvation."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The focus of Pound's own arguments is the American <i>risorgimento</i> that might have been expected to accompany the economic and political birth of the new nation—but which he notes has yet to take place. And Pound offers three reasons for this. First, even though the arts "are a nation's foreign office" and serve as a key means by which "nations gain for each other . . . understanding and intimate respect," American arts to date have been either too parochial or too derivative of European models to serve this crucial civic purpose effectively.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Second, while much of the periodical press caters to the public's demand for lowbrow entertainments, the so-called "'better magazines'" have failed to support "living art," art that does something other than comply with formulae.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  And third, the American system of higher education contributes substantially to the public sphere's failures to function effectively as an inclusive imagined community: having adopted the Germanic model of scholarship, institutions of higher education are failing to engage the public at large in the excitement of aesthetic as well as scientific discoveries, Pound argues. America would be far better off, he goes on to suggest, if it were to reorganize the system of higher education on the model of the American Academy in Rome so as to provide working artists with financial stipends and an opportunity 

<b></b>

 to interact with academic researchers. That, plus the dissemination of Ph.D.-level research through the periodical press would, Pound claims, create a scenario in which universities, practicing artists, and the periodical press would be "linked together for some sort of mutual benefit and stimulus" and a "common-sense view of the arts, as something normal, refreshing, sustaining" would again be possible.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>   </p>

<p>A "common-sense view of the arts," a view of the arts "as something normal, refreshing, sustaining": this element of Pound's argument, even its phrasing, would have resonated strongly with <i>New Age</i> readers, who would have heard very similar arguments about the value of "brilliant common sense" and the role of the arts in a truly revolutionary socialism in articles by Orage himself as well as from regular contributors such as Penty, Ramiro de Maetzu, and Ivor Brown. As Penty claims, for example, in a series of articles on "The Restoration of the Guild System" that ran simultaneously with Pound's "Approach to Paris" series, art should not allow itself to be "thrust out of society by the ever-increasing pressure of commercial conditions of existence."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Because beauty is the entitlement of "all and each" ("RGS," 545), art should be a "great socializer for a common and kindred life" (ibid.), not an index of what we would now term cultural capital. Art is, moreover, "one of the great forces of social reconstruction destined to roll back the wave of commercialism" (ibid., 546)—which is why the <i>New Age</i> is so impatient during the pre-war years with socialists who focus exclusively on the "economic emancipation of the workers" and fail to address "the canons that govern the writing of books, the painting of pictures, the preaching of sermons, and even the fabric of religion," as Orage complains in "Journals Insurgent," a key statement of his editorial policies.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Michael Coyle has explained Pound's "organic" conceptualization of culture, his debt to Victorian sages such as John Ruskin in this regard, and the role that the <i>New Age</i> played for him in both imagining and staging a public sphere undivided into "political" and "literary" arenas.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  What interests me here is Pound's turn toward a more distinctively and narrowly literary mode of address in his next set of publications for the <i>New Age</i>, the 1913 "Approach to Paris" series. In sharp contrast to his solicitousness toward a general readership in his earliest contributions to the journal, this series in the fall of 1913 strikes the high note of "isolated superiority" that will eventually separate Pound, the "loathed disturber," from T. S. Eliot, the editor and movement-maker of modernism after World War I, as Michael Levenson has argued.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Although none of the essays in this series was in fact selected by Eliot for republication in <i>The Literary Essays of Ezra Pound</i>, they are nonetheless replete with the Poundian touchstones of high modernist aesthetics featured in Eliot's "carefully constructed" and powerfully influential "retrospective" of Pound's contribution to literary modernism.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The "brains of to-morrow's Paris," Pound announces admiringly in the first installment, are holding "a council of war" against "general stupidity"—something missing as yet on the London literary scene, it seems, for praise of contemporary French poetry is offered hand in hand with sharp criticisms of London in this new series.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  London is "just an easy-chair, the most comfortable place in the world." Dominated by "older and unattainable writers" like Henry James and W. H. Hudson, it is also home to "at 

<b></b>

 least one notable poet, and perhaps a dizaine [sic] of men who have written delightful poems, and, perhaps, a half-dozen young men who want really to come at good writing" ("API," 552). Throughout this series, Pound's self-presentation is as a "serious artist" not a layman reading for his private diversion."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Scientific metaphors are rife, deployed as a means of reinforcing the importance of both the poet's and the literary critic's enterprises.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  In line with views expressed in his earlier essays on America, Pound complains here about the current state of higher education and its relationship to print journalism and the book trade: "I set out these platitudes," he writes in "Approach to Paris II," "because very few people can be persuaded to think of the art of poetic rhythm as an art, and even when some intelligent critic has thought upon these matters seriously he is so apt to be followed by a horde of Boileaus, professors, teachers, jackals and 'yanqui editors of chaste magazines,' that the effect of his intelligence is almost nullified."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Such complaints are yoked with concern for poetry's marginality in the modern world as well as for the public's indifference to the arts more generally, even though they are vital, Pound claims, to the development of the human race.  </p>

<p>And all of these now familiar Poundian sound bites are built around lots and lots of long, un-translated passages of contemporary French poetry. An exemplary case in point would be the presentation of Remy de Gourmont's "Le Livres des Litanies" in "Approach to Paris II." The first passage Pound presents consumes almost an entire column of print on a <i>New Age</i> page, and it is quickly followed by three almost equally lengthy quotations from "Fleurs du Jadis" and "Les Saintes du Paradis."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Equally noteworthy in the current context is that the commentary suturing these quotations together, though just barely, actually constitutes a very deliberate refusal to provide detailed analysis of this poetry, even though Pound is deploying these quotations in the service of an argument about the need for careful attention to Luminous Details. Pound began "I Gather the Limbs of Osiris" with a request that his readers "bear with [him] a little" and the reassurance that he would be writing "of things which we all know and upon which we for the most part agree" ("OII," 130). By contrast, "Approach to Paris II" plunges the reader into specific poetic examples without either providing any background information about de Gourmont or explaining why his poetry should be of interest to <i>New Age</i> readers. Moreover, there is no sustained critical exegesis here. After quoting thirty-seven noncontiguous lines from "Le Livre," for example, Pound breaks off rather summarily: "And so it runs with ever more sweeping cadence with ever more delicate accords, and if you are not too drunk with the sheer naming over of beauty you will wake at the end of the reading and know that the procession of all women that ever were has passed before you" ("AII," 578). Anticipating the reader's failure to agree with this last point, he then proffers the following remarks:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I dare say these fragments are unconvincing, but I cannot quote the whole poem in this notice. Neither can I, for the benefit of those deaf to accords, go over the strophes quoted and point out every resolution of sound and every repetition subtler than rhyme. If a man is incapable of hearing this litany I cannot help it. If he is incapable of discerning any melody of words less delicate than that which is marked off by the emphasising of such obvious similarities as cat and bat, again I cannot help it.<b></b></p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">For a critic intent on introducing a "new method of literary scholarship" to a readership as heterogenous as the <i>New Age</i>'s, this is a curiously hostile rhetorical stance to assume. As Gail McDonald notes, Pound was intensely engaged by issues of education throughout his career, starting with his early critiques of American higher education and ending, painfully, in his "salon" at St. Elizabeths.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Yet he is strikingly disdainful of the teaching moment offered by this series of articles in the <i>New Age</i> about contemporary French poetry. He thrusts long passages of French poetry under his <i>New Age</i> readers' noses, then announces he cannot teach them to appreciate the music of these lines. He refuses to proceed with the patience required for close textual analysis: "[I cannot] for the benefit of those deaf to accords, go over the strophes quoted and point out every resolution of sound and every repetition subtler than rhyme." Failing even to address the issue of why he has chosen <i>not</i> to translate any of this verse, he implies in fact that appreciation of poetry's music is unteachable. It is an innate skill rather than a learned behavior: "If a man is incapable of hearing this litany I cannot help it. If he is incapable of discerning any melody of words less delicate than that which is marked off by the emphasising of such obvious similarities as <i>cat</i> and <i>bat</i>, again I cannot help it" ("AII," 578).  </p>

<p>The abrasiveness of these remarks is palpable. In his 1942 Rome broadcasts for the BBC, Pound describes having come to London in 1908 in order to reach the "educable minority in the United States" still held in sway by London literary culture.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  As noted earlier, in the fall of 1913 the tough-guy braggadocio of <i>Blast</i> lies just over the horizon, still six months ahead in Pound's future. The "thorough contempt for the mob" that he will voice in registering his antipathy to both <i>Poetry</i> and <i>Seven Art</i>'s efforts to create great audiences for great art lies still further off in the future .<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Yet an element of hostility toward the <i>New Age</i>'s common reader is creeping into the "Approach to Paris" series. The sense of solicitousness toward a general readership that marked his earliest writings for this magazine has been replaced by a note of defiance. Since Pound "cannot help" anyone incapable of hearing the litany of de Gourmont's poetry, it would seem that the mere presentation of Luminous Details is to suffice at this point in Pound's campaign on behalf of what he will retrospectively term "the movement, . . . our modern experiment, since 1900."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Or not, as the case may be. For, starting with the third installment of Pound's seven-part series, a series of articles by "T.K.L," the first of two pseudonyms Beatrice Hastings deployed in responding to modernist writings in the <i>New Age</i>, are featured in tandem with Pound's "Approach to Paris" essays. Unlike Pound's essays, these articles do not advertise their sequential development through their titles. Nor do they foreground their contrapuntal relationship to Pound's series—though this is obviously the case to 

<b></b>

 any reader, even though Hastings never once mentions Pound's name. Occasionally, Hastings's essays follow Pound's in a given issue. Sometimes, though, they actually appear before Pound's essay, providing a response to his contribution to the previous week's issue even before the reader encounters the current installment. Not only do these essays evidence the rocky reception Pound's ideas sometimes received in the <i>New Age</i>, they are also what I have come to think of as vintage Hastings: astute in their substantive engagement with the issues of poetic technique and tradition with which Pound is wrestling; cheekily irreverent; Monty Python British by contrast with the rather ponderous American earnestness Pound assumes in presenting himself as a "serious artist" in the "Approach to Paris" series; and sharply critical of Pound's modernist precepts.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Consider, for example, the way Hastings "talks back" to Pound in the opening paragraph of "The Way Back to America," the first installment in her series, which she introduces with the following tongue-in-cheek reference to a classroom setting:<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>   </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Attendez, mes enfants! I am about to waste ten minutes in exposition of the so-called English poets. What I have to say is brief, pardieu! They were all French! Who is that interrupting? Ha—you wish to infer that Chaucer wrote no poetry until he forgot he had once been in France? Well, you may infer what you please, I suppose. What? The "Canterbury Tales"? I smile explosively—all pure French, my dear sir! Now sit down and let me talk.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p class="continued">In their introduction to the digital edition of the <i>New Age</i>, Robert Scholes and the staff of the Modernist Journals Project note how Orage "encouraged various versions of modernism to engage one another in a version of Socratic dialectic—but a dialectic without the authoritative re of Plato's Socrates to utter the last word (last words not being good for a weekly magazine that wants readers to buy the next issue."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  As the opening salvo from Hastings' series might suggest, however, the dialectic orchestrated by the <i>New Age</i> is not limited simply to a multiplicity of modernisms. It is more expansive still, encompassing not only "various versions" of modernism but also outright attacks on modernist aesthetics and expositions of explicitly nonmodernist agendas for the arts. Moreover, insofar as the journal refuses to grant any single contributor the status of a Socrates, the exchanges it facilitates are more aptly characterized as Bakhtinian dialogics than Platonic dialogues.  </p>

<p>Hastings is a key re in this regard. If she did indeed, as she claims in her autobiography, play midwife to modernism through her behind-the-scenes role as a <i>New Age</i> acquisitions editor, she also played a second and very different role in the pages of the journal through her publications under the pseudonyms "T. K. L." and "Alice Morning." In this sense, the <i>New Age</i>'s dialogics are doubly compounded: by the critiques of modernism featured side by side with contributions promoting various versions of modernism; and by the play of signed, anonymous, and pseudonymous contributions The <i>New Age</i> also orchestrated. Hastings is by no means the only contributor to have practiced authorial ventriloquism in the <i>New Age</i> through her anonymous, pseudonymous, and signed contributions. Orage himself, for example, wrote extensively as "R. 

<b></b>

 H. C.," Arnold Bennett wrote both under his own name and as "Jacob Tonson," and Pound published in this periodical not only under his own signature but also as B. H. Dias and William Atheling. What is unusual, however, is the number of pseudonyms Hastings deployed. The triptych cartoon of her by "Tom. T" [Jan de Junosza Rosciszewski] in the 1 May 1913 art supplement nicely evokes a sense of this multiplicity even while underrepresenting it (<a href="#1"> 1</a>).<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Hastings's exchanges with Pound in the fall of 1913 require contemporary scholars and students of modernism to dismantle Pound's now magisterial author function and appreciate the full complexity of both writers' discursive performances in the <i>New Age</i>. Acknowledging that Pound was an emergent rather than an established literary or cultural authority in this context; recognizing too that some of this magazine's readers would have known the identity of "T. K. L." while others would not have known to link this contributor with Beatrice Hastings (or "Alice Morning," or "Beatrice Tina, or any of the other personae Hastings employed), we have to think differently about which of the two is the insider in the <i>New Age</i> circle at this point in time. After all, although Pound's literary star was certainly on the rise in London and the U.S. in 1913, Hastings was living with the editor when the <i>New Age</i> published these articles.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  More importantly still for my purposes here, we have to think more carefully about what was at stake in the <i>New Age</i>'s outreach to a newly literate working-class and lower-middle-class British populace in order to understand Hastings's objections to Pound's increasingly intemperate stance toward his <i>New Age</i> readers, which she begins to articulate in her very first response to the "Approach to Paris" series through her pseudoacademic address in that opening salvo—a note of mockery toward Pound's stance as a "serious" critic that will be echoed in Tom T.'s October 1913 cartoon of Pound as a dandy (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). Before analyzing Hastings's counterseries in any detail, it will be useful to review the journal's circulation res, history, readership, and self-positioning in the public sphere.  </p>

<p>In August of 1913, the <i>New Age</i>'s weekly circulation was around 4,500: that is, down from its all-time high water mark at 22,000 in 1908, but nonetheless substantially larger than the circulation of the little magazines with whom the history of modernism has been most closely associated, while at the same time substantially smaller than the circulation of mainstream British quarterlies like the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, "smart" American magazines like the <i>Smart Set</i>, or working-class British periodicals like <i>T. P.'s Weekly</i>.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  Initially priced at one penny an issue (in keeping with other political weeklies, such as the <i>Clarion</i>), its cost per issue was raised to <i>3p</i> in 1909, where it would stay until November 1913, when it was raised again, to <i>6p</i>, at which point its circulation dropped again, to 3,500 (<i>NAO</i>, 122). As Scholes <i>et al</i>. emphasize in their introduction to the digital edition, the <i>New Age</i> was "not Bloomsbury, nor was it a creature of the great traditional universities and public schools. Most of the men and women who made it what it was, if they had been to college or university, had studied at the University of London, at the provincial universities, or, like Orage himself, at teacher-training colleges" ("INA," 15). Although it was read by the leading literary and political res of the day, its rank-and-file readers were the socialist autodidacts and left-leaning graduates of Mechanics' Institutes, working men's colleges, teacher's colleges, and extension

lecturing circuits that Orage set out to uplift socially when he and Holbrook Jackson first founded the Fabian Arts Group in 1906 and then bought, in 1907, a thirteen-year-old Christian Socialist journal called <i>New Age</i> and retooled it as a magazine that would appeal to "a generation rising that finds <i>Tit-Bits</i> useless and <i>T. P.'s [Weekly]</i> unsatisfactory."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Even though it dropped the word "socialist" from its masthead by the start of Volume 2 in 1907, the new <i>New Age</i> did not relinquish its self-identification with a socialist "periodical community" until 1919, when Orage's disappointment with political trends post-World War I led him from National Guild Socialism to C. H. Douglas's theory of social credit, psychoanalysis, and Gurdjieffian mysticism (<i>NAO</i>, 266–94). During the pre-war period it positioned itself as frequently and deliberately in relation to periodicals such as the <i>Clarion</i>, <i>Justice</i>, and the <i>Labour Leader</i> as it did to the self-styled "modern" periodicals and little magazines devoted to the promotion of experimental literature and art that emerged during this same period.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The British left, it is also crucial to remember, was quite a "turbulent, volatile" scene at the turn of the twentieth century, a scene where "anarchism and authoritarianism rubbed shoulders, and politics mixed with art more deeply than in other places" on the political spectrum ("INA," 15). While the new <i>New Age</i>, from its very start, never limited its pages to writers of a single political persuasion, it featured the work of Guild Socialists such as A. J. Penty, Ivor Brown, and Ramiro de Maetzu both prominently and frequently in the early 1910s, providing them with extensive opportunities to explain how "the mould of a new civilization" would be created through the establishment of national labor guilds.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  They did so, often enough, not simply by mounting a positive case for their own cause but by critiquing other socialisms and other literary and cultural movements and institutions, thereby contributing to the magazine's distinctively rough-and-tumble intellectual give-and take. Robert Blatchford's <i>Clarion</i>, for example, is criticized regularly between 1912 and 1915 both for supporting its publication through the sale of advertisements and for failing to serve as a forum for "'living' discussion or controversy" among socialists.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The Arts and Crafts movement is accused of not having "a social theory which accords with its artistic philosophy."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Trade unionists need to be cured of the "vice of class conceit."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  Independent Labour Party socialists and Fabians are mocked for being out of touch with common wage-earners, while Fabians are also attacked in tandem with Vorticists and Italian Futurists for their "decadent" fascination with machinery (in their case, the bureaucratic machinery of the emerging welfare state).<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It is in the context of these sorts of exchange—about the cultural work of the arts, the relationship between political and artistic agendas for social change, the responsibility of intellectuals on the left to speak "for" the proletariat, and the role of specific movements and periodicals in working for the re-establishment of "fellowship" in the world of labor—within both a socialist counterpublic sphere and what Morrisson terms the "broader and more generally antibourgeois oppositional sphere" in which magazines such as the <i>Freewoman</i> and <i>New Freewoman</i> operated that Hastings launched her responses to Pound's "Approach to Paris" series (<i>PFM</i>, 92). Having focused many of her earliest contributions to the <i>New Age</i> on the women's suffrage campaign and its 

<b></b>

 relationship to socialist reform, she ventures here into a new (for her) arena of debate, utterly unintimidated by Pound's self-positioning as the "impresario of modernism."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  As the quotation above from the opening paragraph of "Way Back to America" would suggest, Hastings's gloves are off in these exchanges. She matches Pound phrase for gloriously idiosyncratic phrase in these bouts of verbal pugilism, wielding the kind of irony, wit, and black humor commonly ascribed to modernists themselves, not their interlocutors. And the needs of her Board-school-educated <i>New Age</i> readership seem to be foremost in mind as she challenges the haughty pompousness of his pronouncements on French poetry in the "Approach to Paris" series.  </p>

<p>In this regard, it is interesting to note that while Pound quotes liberally in French, Greek, Latin, Italian, and German, Hastings makes a point of translating all of his non-English-language quotations, thereby making this poetry available to a monolingual audience. Occasionally her translations are straightforward, as in "Aristophanes or Tailharde?," the fourth installment in her series, where she offers an example of both poets' work before responding to Pound's comparisons of the two. First she presents a passage from Tailharde: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

<p class="continued">Then she features a translation from Aristophanes:  </p>

Into pitfalls of dilemmas, to perplex him and confound.</p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">This pair of translations sets the stage for her challenge to Pound's claim that Tailharde is a modern-day Aristophanes. "I absolutely cannot find anything in Aristophanes to compare with this [passage in Tailharde] for sheer uncommentated [<i>sic</i>] fact," she argues. "[Aristophanes] will be forever at his opinions. It is no use seeking for bare fact in Aristophanes; and for this reason I opine that Monsieur Tailharde does not belong on the Greek shelf" (ibid., 705). 	 </p>

<p>But if the work of translation is undertaken as a serious enterprise in "Aristophanes or Tailharde?," most of Hastings's responses to Pound feature parody translations, as when, in "The Way Back to America," she does an extended riff on de Gourmont's "fleur hypocrite," mocking Pound as well as his argument about de Gourmont's poetry in the process. I quote at length to give my readers a sense of how much real estate the <i>New Age</i> was willing to devote to Hastings' satire of de Gourmont (and, by association, Pound):<b></b>  </p>

<p class="continued">It would be a mistake to treat this translation as a sign of simple antipathy to Pound's ideas about modern French poetry. To lampoon something or someone well, one must be able to think inside the terms of an argument or position before turning it on its head. Without a doubt, Hastings is capable of wicked satire at Pound's expense. In one sense, her stance in this series calls to mind John Carswell's characterization of George Bernard Shaw's role in the debates about socialism staged in the <i>New Age</i> between Arnold Bennett, Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton, and Shaw in 1908. Shaw's send-up of "Chester-Belloc," Carswell notes, is "not really fair," though it is "very very funny." We would do well to remember Carswell's analysis of the "spectacular controversies" Orage coordinated so brilliantly in the early years of his editorship, and the impact they had on the magazine's circulation and reputation, when considering the <i>New Age</i>'s willingness to feature Hastings and Pound's dueling banjos in 1913.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>   </p>

<p>But if Hastings is willing to overstate her objections to Pound's arguments, she is also genuinely interested in translating his highly abstract and idiosyncratic critical terminology into an idiom more accessible to the <i>New Age</i>'s rank-and-file readership. Arguably, Pound features un-translated passages of French poetry in his essays because he wants to expose his <i>New Age</i> readers to the music and rhythms of French as a language. Hastings's impatience with this strategy is, I would suggest, keyed to her sense that Pound is beginning to talk over the heads of his <i>New Age</i> readers rather than engaging them in appreciation of what he will later term a "contemporary, European, or international criterion" of aesthetic excellence.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  Thus, for example, to return briefly to "Aristophanes or Tailharde?," Hastings takes great pains to explicate Pound's characterization of the "presentative method" of the "'prose tradition' of poetry" in this essay so that she then can use these translations to refute Pound's claims about the formal similarities of their writing: <b></b> </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Pardonnez moi! I profess to see Monsieur Tailharde with eyes even more clear than his own. He <i>resembles</i> Aristophanes. Granted. But the Frenchman forgets to price his modernity. We are too much arrivés nowadays to compare so precisely with the ancients. You must come at least to Catullus for the beginning of our modern vast large virtue of enjoying the decline of power. Tailharde, bless us, guzzles (he would approve the word) the rot of his nation. The Greek vomited to behold his. There accounts the difference in their respective styles.</p>

<p class="continued">In a translation/commentary such as this, Hastings is doing two things. She translates Pound's critical precepts as well as the non-English-language poetry that he argues embodies them in order to make both the critical terminology and the poetic examples more accessible to <i>New Age</i> readers lacking any formal training in either modern or classical languages. But she does so while questioning Pound's aesthetic precepts. In keeping with the English poetic nationalism expressed so strongly by Orage and other frequent contributors to the <i>New Age</i>, she has no patience whatsoever with Pound's criticisms of the London literary scene and his unqualified praise for all things French. Her critique of the parallels he draws between contemporary French and classical Greek poetry in developing a formalist analysis of specific literary techniques is more pointed still, revealing both her familiarity with classical traditions and her deep skepticism concerning purely formalist analysis. She is, in this series, always an advocate for "thick" readings of literary texts in their historical contexts, refusing (as in the above) to countenance strictly formal comparisons. And she is also, always, impatient with Pound for failing to acknowledge his substantial personal investments in both the marketing of "our modern experiment" and the naturalization of poetic and critical difficulty. Mocking Pound's high-handedness, she challenges him to engage more productively in conversation with his <i>New Age</i> audience rather than keeping it at bay through his eugenically-inflected comments about people who are deaf to the music of contemporary French poetry.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Hastings's barbed exchanges with Pound continue beyond this particular series, culminating fifteen months later, in January 1915, with her response, as "Alice Morning," to a new series of essays by Pound in the <i>New Age</i> entitled "Affirmations," which features a combination of cameo portraits (Arnold Dolmetsch, Jacob Epstein, Gaudier-Brzeska) and aesthetic manifestoes (on Imagisme, Vorticism, and the nonexistence of Ireland). While T. K. L.'s responses to Pound's "Approach to Paris" series seem designed to remind Pound of his obligation to keep the conversation about aesthetics accessible to the <i>New Age</i>'s general readership, Alice Morning expresses exasperation with what she characterizes as his "hopeless" cultism. Comparing his manifestos on Imagism and Vorticism with spiritualist rituals involving magic candles and clouds of incense, she writes:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I almost was about to believe while reading his article, "Affirmations," that Mr. Ezra Pound was about to wake up. But he sank quietly deeper on the pillow in his final paragraph, which is only an affirmation that he is a hopeless cultist. Bless my heart, Vortices and Quattrocento! Why drag in physics? "Is it," asks Mr. Pound, "that nature can, in fact, 

<b></b>

 only produce a certain number of vortices? That the Quattrocento shines out because the vortices of power coincided with the vortices of creative energy?" It is all fiddling with terms; and creative energy <i>is</i> power. Were there no vortices in nature before the Quattrocento? Yes; and whirlpools, and surges, and Charybdis, and the wheel of Ixion, whereon was bound the poor diable who embraced a cloud thinking it was Juno. I knew a woman once who had decided that everything went in spirals: and, by the way, she played little tricks on you with magic candles and perfumes that arose out of nowhere. The state of things in Art which Mr. Pound deplores is somewhat due to just such florid, pedantic, obscurantist critics as himself—Ixions whom not even an introduction to the almighty gods can clear of pretension.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup></p>

<p class="continued">What are we to make of these strongly worded criticisms of Pound in the <i>New Age</i>? In his still invaluable early study of the journal under Orage's editorship, Wallace Martin notes how the controversies that erupted "with growing frequency in the <i>New Age</i>" between 1913 and 1914 often took on a personal edge (<i>NAO</i>, 187). In the pre-war heyday of avant-garde blasting and bombadiering, Pound, T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, F. S. Flint, and Richard Aldington took pot shots at each other, not just at Walter Sickert and other advocates of "modern" (but not "modernist") art.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  What Martin tends to downplay, though, are the criticisms beamed at the modernist avant-garde by Orage himself, by regular contributors to the magazine such as Hastings, and by readers contributing "Letters to the Editor." Now that the Modernist Journal Project's 

<b></b>

 online edition of the <i>New Age</i> is complete, this counterblasting and counterbombadiering is no longer buried in the archives. In other words, to invoke George Bornstein's phrasing and method of analysis, the original bibliographic and contextual codes of the modernist writing that the <i>New Age</i> both featured and gave itself license to challenge are fully exposed again—and scholars and students of modernism need to grapple fully with such historical evidence rather than ignore it. </p>

<p>In this context it is worth returning to the quotation from one of the editor's regular weekly columns, "Readers and Writers," that serves as the epigraph to this essay:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Was it right, I have been asked, for THE NEW AGE to allow "T. K. L." to "mimick" Mr. Pound's articles on Parisian writers while these were still being published? My own answer is, Yes, and with more reasons than I can set down. Nobody, I suppose, thinks it odd that Mr. [Hilaire] Belloc should write in THE NEW AGE in criticism of the National Guilds System; and nobody will think it odd if the editorial exponents of that system reply either currently or at the conclusion of the series. Why, then, should it be thought strange to publish Mr. Pound's articles and subject them to criticism while they are still before our readers? . . . It will be found, if we all live long enough, that every part of THE NEW AGE hangs together; and that the literature we despise is associated with the economics we hate as the literature we love is associated with the form of society we would assist in creating. <i>Mr. Pound—I say it with all respect—is the enemy of THE NEW AGE</i>.</p>

<p class="continued">The <i>New Age</i> has been described as both "eclectic" and "catholic" in its coverage of contemporary issues in politics, literature, and the arts.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  Yet, in fact it could be narrowly partisan—and thereby profoundly critical of the modernist avant-garde—because of its commitment, during this period, to the promotion of a National Guild Socialist agenda for the arts.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  R. H.C.'s November 1913 column states this case bluntly through its comparison of Pound's treatment in the <i>New Age</i> with that of Hilaire Belloc: the journal is willing to feature both men's work often within its pages, because it prides itself on providing "some neutral ground where intelligences may meet on equal terms" in a public debate about politics, literature, and the arts.<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  Yet it fiercely defends its right to publish critiques of their work for this same reason.  </p>

<p>By contrast with R. H. C.'s grand distancing gestures in this particular column (and his much more generous assessment of Pound's work subsequently), Hastings's readings of Pound are both more narrowly focused and consistently skeptical.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  She works more intimately with his poetics, struggling to make his ideas more accessible to <i>New Age</i> readers, but ultimately expressing frustration with his work precisely because he gives up on that readership: fails to engage it, characterizes it as un-teachable. The driving force behind her criticisms of Pound, I would suggest, is her refusal to normalize difficulty, which in turn is motivated by her unwillingness to talk over the heads of the <i>New Age</i>'s rank-and-file readership. Notably, this audience was predominantly <i>not</i> Oxbridge-educated or socially elite. Yet it was engaged by wide-ranging public debates about the arts, thanks to the universality of primary education since 1870, the centrality of language-through-literature training in a vastly expanded state education 

<b></b>

 system, and the deep intersections of art and politics in the socialist counterpublic sphere noted earlier.<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  And the <i>New Age</i> stands behind not only Hastings but also "John Doe" contributors such as John Duncan in publishing their complaints to Pound about being left behind, left out of the conversation about aesthetics, as he proceeds with the promotion of the modernist avant-garde as an "expert culture": an elite, coterie culture supported by "patron-investors" that refuses to countenance the possibility that "great art" might find an audience with "great audiences."<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>   </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
III. "Had she read my article with that care with which even my lightest utterance deserves . . ."
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>In closing, I want to look briefly at two letters to the editor Pound published in the <i>New Age</i> that register antithetical reactions to <i>New Age</i> readers and editors' challenges to his ideas. The first letter, dated January 14, 1915—that is, the week <i>before</i> Hastings's response to his new "Affirmations" series was published—praises the journal for its commitment to open debate and genuine intellectual exchange within its pages. "THE <i>NEW AGE</i>," Pound writes, "permits one to express beliefs which are in direct opposition to those held by the editing staff. In this, [it] sets a most commendable example to certain other periodicals which not only demand that all writers in their columns shall turn themselves into a weak and puling copy of the editorial board, but even to damage one's income if one ventures to express contrary beliefs in the columns of other papers."<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  Two weeks later, however—that is, a week <i>after</i> Alice Morning's response to his first "Affirmations" essay appeared on January 21—Pound is quick to attack the woman who initiated the cascade of letters challenging his views:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Sir,—the executive and the creative or inventive faculties are not the same. Miss Morning's quibble over my use of the terms "power" and "creative energy" is unworthy of her voracious intellect. <i>Had she read my article with that care with which even my lightest utterance deserves, she would have been able most clearly to understand me</i>. When Miss Morning confines herself to translating Max Jacob's poems and to bringing unfamiliar matter before us, we are most grateful for her Parisian explorations.</p>
<p>Mr. Aldington's priapic parody of his own most successful poem (In Via Sestina) is of considerably less value. <i>Miss Morning at least advances the discussion by forcing me to define one of my terms more exactly</i>.<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>I read Pound's first letter as an endorsement of the <i>New Age</i>'s commitment to Bahktinian dialogics in the public sphere. Because the Cursitor Street office's papers were lost in the bombing of London during World War II, and because Orage systematically destroyed his personal papers as well, we do not know whether Orage solicited this particular editorial from Pound, or edited it before publishing it. By making the published pages of this magazine easily accessible to contemporary readers and students of modernism, however, the Modernist Journal Project's digital edition of the <i>New Age</i> exposes the controversies surrounding modernism's first emergence in the public sphere—and helps us gauge the "critical heterogeneity" of opinion about this emergence (<i>PFM</i>, 13). 
<b></b> </p>

<p>Although Pound advocates on behalf of such free and open intellectual exchanges in his first letter, he forecloses that possibility in the second as he takes the moral and aesthetic high ground in opposition to his resistant readers. Pound makes several discrete rhetorical moves in this second letter. He concedes that Hastings' objections to his pedantic obscurity have forced him to "define one of [his] terms more exactly." He encourages her to confine herself to the work of translation.<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  And he reads her resistance to the difficulty of his writing as a failure to read carefully enough. In his recent book, <i>The Difficulties of Modernism</i>, Leonard Diepeveen analyzes the "social rhetoric" of difficulty in Anglo-American culture, 1910–1950. Difficulty, he notes, "is not just a property of some works of art—it is a cultural <i>situation</i>, the smooth management of which gains a person entry into high culture."<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>  Diepeveen's analysis of the gendered dimension of cultural situations involving the negotiation of "difficulty" is very pertinent here, for Pound's dismissal of Hastings's criticisms in this second letter bears a striking likeness rhetorically to T. S. Eliot's "Olympian, pompous" mode of address in the early essays for the <i>New Statesman</i>, the <i>Egoist</i>, and the <i>TLS</i> that played such a key role in "re-forming" the reading habits of his audience.<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>  In fact, Diepeveen's characterization of how this mode of address works in Eliot's early criticism to secure his reader's complicity in his aesthetic judgments—"[n]ot to go along with the argument swept along by these [rhetorical] techniques is to ally oneself with amateurism, sloppiness, and 'women'"—aptly describes Pound's second letter.<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>  Except of course that Pound has literalized the allusion to gender as he discredits Miss Morning's "quibble" over terminology and her failure to grasp his arguments.<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Listen again to Pound's response to a reader he concedes has a "voracious intellect" yet dares to disagree with him: "Had she read my article with that care with which even my lightest utterance deserves, she would have been able most clearly to understand me." It is a clever putdown, but a putdown nonetheless, even if it also allows for a bit of humorous self-mockery, as we see Pound assuming the mantle of dandified academic self-importance he complained of in earlier contributions to the <i>New Age</i> when he wrote disparagingly about "professors, teachers, jackals, and 'yanqui editors of chaste magazines.'" "<i>Had she read my article with that care with which even my lightest utterance deserves, she would have been able most clearly to understand me</i>." If you had read me carefully, T. K. L., you would be one of "us." Since you did not, you are one of "them": the uninitiated, the antimodernists who remain outside the gates of Culture. Claiming the moral and aesthetic high ground, Pound's response misses Hastings's point entirely—which is to demand the inclusion of a general, lay audience in a conversation about aesthetics, rather than conceptualizing the latter as an elite, exclusive, minority-culture phenomenon. Bakhtinian dialogics are replaced by Platonic monologue here as Pound shuts down this conversation: claims the last word, asserts the unchallengeable authority of his aesthetic judgments.  </p>

<p>To end on a polemical (but nonetheless dialogical) note: I would like to see modernist studies truly defamiliarize difficulty as we continue the work of recovering modernism's original bibliographic and contextual codes and restoring the full complexity of its first emergence in a diverse array of turn-of-the-twentieth-century periodicals—an array that 

<b></b>

 includes but is by no means limited to the noncommercial "small magazines" that have been center stage to date in the material historical scholarship on modernism.<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>  This would make space in the field for further study of modernism's original interlocutors, some of whom were "voracious intellect[s]" like Hastings, fully capable of deploying what are often assumed to be modernism's signature tactics of irony, wit, and black humor in questioning each and every precept of an emergent modernist aesthetics. This would also allow scholars and students of modernism to recognize that a multiplicity of cultural agendas for the arts were still available at the turn of the twentieth century, not all of which positioned artists and intellectuals comfortably in allegiance with difficulty, highbrow culture, and the academy. Such advances in the field would, however, require us to continue probing not only our own continued allegiances to "expert culture," as Lois Cucullu and others have argued, but also the "rules of scarcity" that continue to organize literary reputation, restricting the number of names and texts that "remain in heavy rotation" in modernist studies in spite of several decades worth of extensive revisionary work, as Aaron Jaffe has noted out recently.<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>  I hope we are willing to expand our conversations about modernism(s) to encompass these kinds of challenges. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>. Current conversations about the "state of the arts" in modernist studies tend to focus on the adequacy of the terms "modernism" and "modernisms." The thrust of my argument here, by contrast, is to encourage a wholesale re-imagining of turn-of-the-twentieth-century studies, so as to address aspects of the historical record that have been either obscured or effaced by both dominant <i>and</i> revisionary treatments of modernism. I will typically default to the singular term "modernism" or "modernist avant-garde" in this essay not because I assume there was any kind of consensus in the early twentieth century about a singular phenomenon called "modernism" but rather because I do not want to lose sight of the centripetal energies of avant-garde cultural politics: the insider/outsider, us/them dynamics of self-promotionalism that mark the cultural avant-garde's transformation into modernism between 1912 and 1922.

As Martin notes, none of the political weeklies published between 1907 and 1922 had a circulation greater than that of the <i>Spectator</i>—which declined from 22,000 in 1903 to 13,500 in 1922. <i>The Nation</i> and <i>The Saturday Review</i> probably had larger circulations before the war than the <i>New Age</i>, which had a fifteen-year average of over 3,000, while the <i>New Statesman</i>'s circulation increased from 3,000 to 7,000 between 1913 and 1925 (<i>NAO</i>, 10). By contrast, the circulation of the modernist little magazines ranged from several hundred to a thousand. Once reported to have a circulation of about 2,000, the <i>Little Review</i>'s circulation in fact is "unlikely" to have risen "much over a thousand," as Frank Mott notes in <i>A History of American Magazines, Vol. 5 Sketches of Twenty-One Magazines, 1905–1930</i> [(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1968), 171]. As Jane Lidderdale and Mary Nicholson have noted, <i>The Egoist</i>'s largest circulation was 400 copies per issue in 1913 during its first six months of publication. After long-term subscriptions ran out in November 1916, its circulation never rose again above 200 [<i>Dear Miss Weaver</i> (New York: Viking, 1970), 460.] For information about the <i>Smart Set</i>'s history and circulation (which peaked at 165,000 in 1905–06, but plateaued at about 50,000 readers in 1915), see Sharon Hamilton, "The First New Yorker?

<p><a name="FOOT55" href="#REF55">55</a>. I borrow the term "periodical community" from Lucy Delap, who uses it to discuss how self-identified "modern" periodicals like the <i>Freewoman </i>and the <i>New Age</i> positioned themselves in relation to each other in Edwardian Britain, sharing personal and professional networks of both readers and contributors, placing advertisements in each other's pages, and participating in "freelist" exchanges that do not necessarily or obviously observe the hierarchy of status in the periodical press's increasingly diversified landscape. See "<i>The Freewoman</i>, Periodical Communities, and the Feminist Reading Public," <i>Princeton University Library Chronicle</i> 61 : 233–76. Delap's reading of the <i>New Age</i>'s self-positioning in the public sphere needs to be complicated through recognition of its engagement in a socialist periodical community that included magazines established in the 1880s and 1890s such as the <i>Clarion</i>, the <i>Labour Leader</i>, and <i>Justice</i> as well as regional periodicals like the Bristol Venture as well as those representing "modern" metropolitan interests like the <i>New Statesman</i>. Nonetheless, her argument about how periodical communities function dovetails beautifully with Alan Golding's recent research on the "dialogism" of the <i>Little Review</i> and the <i>Dial</i>, offering further proof of the need for a "historically based model for considering how the shaping of taste by modernist magazines is a collective project, not a matter of the atomized influence of single publications" ("<i>The Dial</i>, <i>The Little Review</i>, and the Dialogics of Modernism," 43). </p>

In response to a public announcement that the <i>Clarion</i> was folding in 1915, he proclaims: "that final divorce between publicism and advertisement which so many of you have long desired" has finally been achieved. "The pillmakers having gone, let them never come back. Let them spread their nets in the dailies, those breeding-places of wild geese. But let us weeklies abjure them and trust to the public even if we perish of it" ("Readers and Writers," the <i>New Age</i>, August 12, 1915, 357). <i>The Clarion</i> actually continued to be published through 1927; the announcement in 1915 was a false alarm, one of many in the face of periodic funding crises. It is interesting to note in this context that the <i>New Age</i> discontinued all advertisements other than its own subscription advertisments at the outset of Volume 15 (May 7, 1914).  </p>

As Morrisson's analysis of the subscription lists, price changes, and marketing strategies of the <i>Freewoman</i>, <i>New Freewoman</i>, and <i>Egoist</i> would suggest, the <i>New Age</i>'s increases in price between 1907 and 1913 put it well beyond the reach of the working-class readers it initially marketed itself to address as a penny weekly (<i>PFM</i>, 105). Like Marsden's magazine, the <i>New Age</i> shifts from one "discursive arena" to another as it re-imagines and "up-markets" itself during this period (ibid., 104). The doubling of price in November 1913—just after the exchanges between Pound and Hastings over his "Approach to Paris" series end—may well be an index of its primary interest at this point in time in engaging a rising middle-class "that was highly educated but not endowed with the social prestige and financial capital of the established middle and upper middle classes (ibid., 108). Even if that is the case, though; that is—even if the <i>New Age</i> is marketing itself between 1909 and 1914 to a rising middle class readership rather the working-class audience it reached initially as a 1d. political weekly—its willingness to showcase Hastings's critique of Pound's avant-garde obscurantism in the fall of 1913 still registers its engagement with the public sphere, its resistance to Pound's own re-orientation toward an elite coterie audience for "serious" art. "Our New Avatar," an unsigned editorial published three months after the <i>New Age</i>'s first major price increase in 1909, is an important early statement of the magazine's re-orientation in this regard; see the <i>New Age</i>, February 3, 1910, 316–17. </p>

"I would part Mr Pound from his theories as often as I found him clinging to one, for they will in the end be his ruin," Orage writes on August 5, 1915 (<i>NAO</i>, 332–3). What Orage shared with Pound, however, is a belief that good poetry is "a product of conscious discipline rather than inexplicable afflatus" (New Age Under Orage, 256). Thus, on July 25, 1918 Orage will defend Pound's poetic craftsmanship. Noting how English critics "pretend that poetry grows on bushes or in parsley-beds," Orage describes Pound's tendency to offer "a ton of precept for a pound of example" as an American habit—"more than in any other country save Germany, it appears to be required [in America] of a man that there shall be 'significance', intention, aim, theory—anything you like expressive of direction—in everything he does." Yet the "truth of the matter" about poetry and craftsmanship, he goes on to emphasize, "lies with Mr Pound. Dangerous as it may be to require that a poet shall be learned in his profession, it is much more dangerous to deprecate his learning" (the <i>New Age</i>, July 25, 1918, 201). See also Orage's

<p id="lead">The paradoxical directive both to "make it new" and to retrieve a usable past has become a commonplace in accounts of American literary modernism. For Pound, Eliot, and H. D., the Classical tradition and its literary monuments provided foundations on which to reinvent poetic form. Moreover, such cultural artifacts served the purpose of articulating an American modernity; as Celena Kusch has argued, American modernists felt "considerable pressure to create an ancient well of artistic experience and ability for themselves."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In achieving these goals, making it new and retrieving the past were neither mutually exclusive activities, nor exclusive to creative writers. As H. D.'s generation of modern poets came of age, Egyptology emerged as an American academic discipline—a key intersection that critics have largely overlooked. James Henry Breasted, the father of American Egyptology and founder of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, would formulate a "New Past" that positioned the United States as Egypt's cultural inheritor. Influenced by modernist Egyptology as well as by her travels, H. D. came to share with Breasted a belief in Egypt's cultural primacy. And like Breasted, she would seek a monumental past that did not simply reinshrine the traditional Greco-Roman one. If Europe had a lock on Classical monuments, and the United States lacked monuments in the traditional sense, ancient Egypt offered these Egypto-modernists a new usable past that rerouted Eurocentric cultural transmission. </p>

<p>This essay crosses disciplines both in terms of its central res and its methodology—a collaboration between a literary critic and a Classical archaeologist. For Breasted and 

<b></b>

 H. D., archaeology proved fundamental to understanding Egypt. Indeed, archaeological tropes inflected a wide range of artistic, scholarly, and popular discourses during the modernist period, as the editors reminded us in the  special issue "Archaeologies of the Modern." Jeffrey Schnapp, Michael Shanks, and Matthew Tiews note that archaeology has contributed to "historical, national, and international myths of origin and (dis)continuity: of group identity formation (nationalisms), race (ethnicity), technological progress, the rise and fall of civilizations."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Breasted's excavation projects were important means of acquiring artifacts for the Oriental Institute, furthering his academic career and enhancing his popular appeal as a lecturer and fund raiser. In his writing Breasted would link archaeology to the discourse of evolution in formulating the New Past. H. D. owned copies of his <i>A History of Egypt</i> and five-volume <i>Ancient Records of Egypt,</i> as well as <i>A Concise Dictionary of Egyptian Archaeology. </i>When H. D.'s critics have addressed archaeology, they tend to focus on Freudian psychoanalysis, which, as Julian Thomas states, offers the clearest "metaphorical use" of the discipline in modern thinking.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  And yet as we shall see, her stratigraphy is more materialist than Freud's. H. D. insists, for example, that she had seen Karnak's Amun temple pictured on Freud's wall, while "he had not."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Both H. D. and Breasted were drawn especially to this ancient site, which res prominently in their work. </p>

<p>Each writer in fact shared an archaeological sensibility that "mak[es] material culture the equal of text, " as Gavin Lucas puts it.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Breasted validated his cultural work by emphasizing his proximity to ancient archaeological sites. For example, he stresses that his textbook <i>A History of the Ancient Egyptians</i> is "based directly and immediately upon the monuments" and is thus distinct from the growing number of books produced "at second and third hand."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  H. D.'s story "Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt" contains four scenes in which the protagonist simulates excavation: "she paused, digging with her gloved finger down some inches (it seemed) into the incurve (cut clean in the stone)." In <i>Helen in Egypt</i> the protagonist effects a spiritual epigraphy by decoding hieroglyphic inscriptions in the Amun temple, seeking to "realize the transcendental in material terms."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Epigraphy, a subdiscipline of archaeology and a major component of Breasted's research, involves the transcription and translation of hieroglyphs. He founded the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute in Luxor in 1924 to record ancient inscriptions and reliefs that were rapidly deteriorating. Although H. D. could not read hieroglyphics, the fact that women were often employed as transcribers in such projects may have furthered her sense of physical connection. Breasted and H. D. valued the inscribed nature of ancient Egyptian monuments, and they drew on these artifacts to ground their alternative depictions of Egypt.  </p>

<p>Comparing the archaeologically-inflected views of Breasted and H. D. with other modernist representations of Egypt complicates our understanding of how Western thinkers positioned its ancient culture. Breasted's numerous excavations helped establish him as the first professor of Egyptology in the United States, and prompted his influential New Past theory. H. D.'s engagement with Egypt's ancient sites was a crucial factor in her move to the long poem and major status. Although Egypt would ultimately prove more heterogeneous for H. D. than for Breasted, both constructed an American 

<b></b>

 Nile through which they asserted cultural authority and national identity. During the chaos and destruction engendered by two global wars, Breasted and H. D. would turn to ancient Egypt as a source of spiritual stability and renewal. Their revaluation and repositioning of Egypt as central to Western civilization's development—which we term <i>Egypto-modernism</i>—provides an alternative to the Hellenistic frameworks that shaped mainstream modernist thought. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Ancient Egypt's Shifting Terrains
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Breasted and H. D. were well aware that their explorations of ancient Egypt circulated within a culture that had become saturated with popular misconceptions. Even before the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, there was a fashion for things Egyptian in Europe, Britain, and America. In the first decade of the twentieth century, exotic renderings of Egypt shaped popular music such as the Oriental foxtrot and the 1905 song "There's Egypt in Your Dreamy Eyes."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Antonia Lant notes that a proliferation of mummy films appeared in the U.S. between 1912 and 1915, "at least four film companies" worked in Egypt before World War I, and five Cleopatra films were produced "between 1908 and 1918 alone."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Indeed, the emphasis on female licentiousness in both Biblical and Classical literary traditions shaped the <i>femmes fatales</i> of early cinema, which included Potiphar's wife (Jacob's would-be seducer), as well as Cleopatra. With the exception of Biblical films about Moses and the book of Exodus, exotic conceptions of Egypt had begun to overshadow the despotic vision of pharaoh present in the Hebrew captivity narrative. Americans' fascination with ancient Egypt preceded the emergence of academic Egyptologists like Breasted, who noted in his journal that the Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead</i> had already "become, in title at least, a household word in the Western world."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  So when Howard Carter began excavating Tut's treasures in 1922, the effect "was a bit like adding gasoline to a fire," as Michael North puts it. Sarah Witte notes that Egyptian influenced fashions were prominent in both <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> throughout the 1920s.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  H .D.'s story "Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt" reflects this oversaturation when protagonist Helen Fairwood perceives that "'everything seems painted . . . cardboard,'" a vocabulary similar to the one H. D. used to deride overdone sets in historical epic films. In the story, Captain Rafton's response to Fairwood points to the popular sources of her perceptual bias: "'You mean you seem to have seen all this before? But it's on everything, cigarette boxes posters in the underground; cigarette boxes [sic], magazine ads'" (<i>P,</i> 188). Because Westerners tended to view Egypt as source of the exotic and mysterious rather than of civilization, tourists' initial impressions could be unsatisfactory—even when viewing ancient monuments. </p>

<p>The Tutankhamun excavations and other archaeological sites proved crucial to H. D.'s and Breasted's revaluation of Egypt's role in cultural transmission. Breasted entered Tutankhamun's tomb several times at Howard Carter's request, deciphering seals on the doorways and providing other historical information. Although he was a seasoned Egyptologist, Breasted was nonetheless jarred by Tutankhamun's treasures: 

<b></b>

 "Here was the magnificence which only the wealth and splendor of the Imperial Age in Egypt in the fourteenth century before Christ could have wrought or conceived." The golden royal chariots<b>—</b>which Breasted saw as "not vulgar and ostentatious magnificence, but the richness of matured and refined art"—made "the splendor of Nineveh and Babylon" appear to be "but a rough foil for setting off the civilization of Egyptian Thebes" (qtd. in <i>PP,</i> 331, 337). H.D. saw one of the chariot wheels brought from the tomb. Filtering her perception through Helen Fairwood in the "Secret Name" story, she describes its startling brightness as being "brought to birth, brought back after four thousand years, to light. The very chariot wheel, gold, too gold, not even with the softness of some Mycenaean or Grecian burial to tone it down, to give it semblance of antiquity" (<i>P, </i>191). Here "too gold" both reinforces Orientalist conceptions of a gaudy East, and troubles temporal boundaries by appearing new. The Tutankhamun discovery, which North has termed "the first truly modern media event,"<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  circulated widely in the press and popular imagination, drawing crowds to Carter's excavation. Although Tut's tomb was a significant site for Breasted and H. D., the monumental expansiveness of Karnak would allow them more room to articulate their Egypto-modernism. </p>

<p>Both were especially influenced by Karnak's vast temple complex dedicated to the sun god Amun, one of the chief gods of the Egyptian pantheon. Before the Tut phenomenon, continuing excavations at Karnak made it one of the most studied Egyptian sites in the early twentieth century. Every ancient Egyptian pharaoh from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000 B.C.E.) until the Ptolemaic period (c. 330 B.C.E.) made additions to Karnak, so that it constituted for Breasted "a great historical volume";<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  most of the columns and walls are covered with hieroglyphs. Spreading across ten acres and including the colossal temple to Amun, the main complex has hundreds of lotus bud columns, statues, and obelisks. An additional eighty-five enclosed acres are filled with smaller temples and storehouses. Breasted's writings emphasize the sheer size and scale of the buildings, noting that in "the greatest colonnaded hall ever erected by man" each column capital "is large enough to contain a group of a hundred men standing crowded upon it at the same time" (<i>CC, </i>99). These particular columns are approximately seventy feet high (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). H. D. is similarly impressed with Karnak's colossal scale. Her surrogate character Helen Fairwood, who has "hard-won" expertise in Classics, notes that "the Parthenon itself" would fit into the "enormous court-yard" of Tuthmoses II's banquet chamber, with sufficient room to include "such tiny exquisite toys as the Erechtheum and the Nike," other major buildings of the Acropolis (<i>P,</i> 176, 214). The Parthenon is widely considered the greatest achievement of ancient Greek sacred architecture. And yet for H. D., Karnak's divine proportions challenge the Classical world's use of humans as the standard of measurement:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In Greece, even in so late a building as the Italian Paestum there was that strange insistence upon human achievement. One measured oneself by the tiny Nike temple, out-jutting on the Acropolis. Even in the more massive Paestum, one measured oneself and one's status by some known and intellectual formula. Here was magnificence of another order."</p>

<p class="continued">

 H. D. would struggle to let go of her Hellenism which, as Eileen Gregory points out, gave her writing an "orientation within historical, aesthetic, and psychological mappings."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Fairwood reflects this dilemma because in order to reach her epiphany, she must revalue ancient Greek cultural achievement with respect to Egypt's.  </p>

<p>"Secret Name" also compares Egyptian lotus bud columns to Classical Greek architecture: "Great fervid buds, not like the columns of the Greeks that hold in their straight fair line a sort of challenge, not an appeal so much as a command to the intellect to soar up and up. These bulbous buds, enormous, pregnant, seemed endowed after these four thousand years with some inner life; to hold that possibility of sudden bloom-burst" (<i>P, </i>213). As with Tut's golden chariot wheel, Fairwood perceives that these columns incarnate a living spirituality so that their power results from neither intellect nor fascination. Meredith Miller argues that H.D.'s language challenges art 

<b></b>

 critic T. E. Hulme's "binary distinction" between Egyptian hardness and Greek vitality.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Other parts of "Secret Name" also interrogate prevailing cultural refinement narratives, assigning "starkness" to the Greek rather than Egyptian side: "It was utterly Athenian starkly to define, to outline in terms of thought every human emotion, not making allowance for this intermediate state where shadows of bronze palms were soft and fern-like, where thought and emotion were delicately merged" (<i>P,</i> 193). This characterization sharply contrasts W. B. Yeats's story of Western art's emergence in "Under Ben Bulben": "Measurement began our might: / Forms a stark Egyptian thought, / Forms that gentler Phidias wrought."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  H. D.'s Egypto-modernism begins when Karnak challenges her contemporaries' cultural investment in Greece, including her male compatriots Pound and Eliot. As Breasted noted in his groundbreaking 1916 textbook <i>Ancient Times,</i> "the habit of regarding ancient history as beginning with Greece has become so fixed that it is not easily to be changed."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  </p>

<p>H. D. was not the only American poet who incorporated Egyptian artifacts into her writing, but she placed them into fuller archaeological contexts than her peers and predecessors. This quality distinguishes her work from Marianne Moore's object-centered "An Egyptian Pulled Glass Bottle in the Shape of a Fish," in which the artifact operates primarily as a re for poetry. H. D.'s mythic references to Egypt are similarly grounded, so that her allusions to <i>The Book of the Dead </i>are not as displaced as those in Muriel Rukeyser's documentary poem of the same name (which memorializes a mining disaster). Walt Whitman anticipates some aspects of H. D.'s Egypto-modernism, although he never traveled to Egypt. In "Salut du Monde!," for example, he marvels at hieroglyphic inscriptions as a kind of stone papyrus: "I look on chisell'd histories, records of conquering kings, dynasties, cut in slabs of sand-stone, or on granite-blocks." As John Irwin notes, Whitman read widely in Egyptology during the 1840s and 1850s, and was a frequent visitor at Dr. Abbott's museum of Egyptology in New York.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  H. D. and her partner Bryher had many books on Egyptology in their library, which included studies of hieroglyphics, mythology, history, and material culture. Besides Breasted's studies, they owned Janet R. Buttles's <i>The Queens of Egypt</i> , Arthur E. P. Weigall's <i>A Guide to the Antiquities of Upper Egypt</i> , A. Bothwell Gosse's <i>The Civilization of the Ancient Egyptians</i> , Mary G. Houston and Florence S. Hornblower's <i>Ancient Egyptian, Assyrian and Persian Costumes &amp; Decorations</i> , Margaret Alice Murray's <i>Egyptian Sculpture</i> , and A. Lucas's <i>Ancient Egyptian Materials .</i> The library also contained several books by E. A. Wallis Budge, including <i>The Dwellers on the Nile</i> , <i>Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics</i> , <i>Egyptian Religion</i> , <i>Egyptian Literature</i> , <i>The Egyptian Heaven and Hell</i> , <i>Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection</i> , and <i>The Book of the Dead: An English Translation</i> .<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Because Budge was such a prolific publisher, it is not surprising that he is so well represented in H. D.'s collection. The few critics who address H. D.'s relationship to Egyptology focus almost exclusively on Budge, but his views were by no means the dominant perspective on ancient Egypt at this time. <b></b></p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Debates within Academic Egyptology
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Modernist Egyptology was an international discipline of competing claims on Egypt's sites and artifacts, and conflicting interpretations of their significance. As the major colonizing powers in the region, European nationals took the lead in these endeavors. The development of a sophisticated ancient culture on non-European (especially African) soil posed a major dilemma, casting doubt upon the hitherto accepted superiority of the West. Scholars partially solved this problem by dislocating Egypt from continental Africa, placing it instead within the cultural milieu of the Orient (variously termed the Ancient Near East, or the Near Orient). So widely accepted was this cartography that Nancy Cunard's influential <i>Negro</i> anthology omitted Egypt from its map of Africa. A corollary of this view was that Egyptian civilization was not indigenous and therefore required an outside impetus for its development. In the late nineteenth century, for example, British archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie proposed conquest by a "Dynastic Race" as the civilizing catalyst, basing his theory on skeletal remains.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Such formulations date back to the mid nineteenth century, when Americans used phrenology to justify slavery. Although Petrie's theory would be discredited, the debate over indigenous or nonindigenous development continued to be an important one for two of the most prominent Egyptologists of the modernist era: Budge and Breasted. </p>

<p>Budge believed that a savage native population was civilized by invaders from the East, while Breasted believed that Egyptian civilization was indigenous and influenced the East. Because Breasted's chain of cultural influence began with Egypt, it became the source rather than the recipient of civilization. Disagreeing with Budge was not unusual for Breasted. Key differences also appear in both men's interpretation of Egyptian religion. Breasted admired the pharaoh Akhenaten's transformation of Egypt's solar religion from polytheism, viewing this change as a precedent for Western monotheism. In contrast, Budge positioned it—and indeed dynastic civilization itself—as the result of "an Asiatic element" which "invaded the country and conquer[ed] the natives"—a people he saw as fundamentally primitive. Indeed, Budge argued in 1904 that the Egyptians could not "become metaphysicians in the modern sense of the word . . . the mere construction of the language would make such a thing impossible, to say nothing of the ideas of the great Greek philosophers, which belong to a domain of thought and culture wholly foreign to the Egyptian."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Thus for Budge, the primitivism he perceived in the ancient Egyptians compromised their cultural achievements. </p>

<p>While Budge argued that Egypt's ancient civilization came from elsewhere, Australian scholar Sir Grafton Elliot Smith took the opposite view that its influence extended practically everywhere. Advocating for an extreme version of Egyptian primacy, Smith proposed a "hyperdiffusionist" theory that affirmed Egyptian technological presence in the pre-conquest civilizations of the New World—and in areas as remote from Egypt as Oceania. Smith denied critics' charges that he attributed "the customs and beliefs of the whole world to Egypt."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  However, in outlining his theories in a series of books beginning with <i>The Migration of Early Cultures</i> , he dismissed the contemporary theory of independent invention. As far as Smith was concerned, if embalming was 

<b></b>

 practiced in Peru and Egypt then Egypt had to be the source. His map of the transmission of technologies published in <i>The Diffusion of Culture</i> links Egypt directly to almost every region of the earth. Modernist Egyptology could be "wildly inventive," as Alice Gambrell notes, even within scholarly communities.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Because the U.S. was a relative newcomer in academic Egyptology, Breasted often took an adversarial stance towards his international counterparts, especially Budge. He noted in his journal that Egyptology had "only a handful of <i>competent</i> followers, and even these often disagreed violently among themselves in fundamental matters of chronology, philology, archaeology and history" (qtd. in <i>PP,</i> 85). Having trained in Germany Breasted had a high regard for the Berlin school, which emphasized close and careful translation. By contrast, he had little respect for Budge. Breasted in fact considered Britain's prolific scholar to be incompetent, despite his prestigious post as Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities for the British Museum. To Breasted the inadequacies of the British Museum reflected Budge's own work: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I showed him one of the most important monuments in the entire collection, so ridiculously labeled that it was evident those who had installed it knew nothing about it. Budge himself now showed that he was ignorant of it. . . . He . . . pled the onerous duties of his office—the labels were old, put on before his time, etc., etc. But his own books, filled with egregious errors, belied him. </p>

<p class="continued">Reporting on his own survey of Nubia in 1905–1906, Breasted repeatedly chronicles Budge's erroneous conclusions about the date and significance of monuments (<a href="#2"> 2</a>).<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Other contemporary scholars also denigrated Budge for inaccurate and careless translations since he persisted in using an antiquated system of transcription. In addition, Budge's many excavations, while garnering numerous artifacts for the British Museum, were criticized for lack of scholarly rigor. In contrast Breasted was noted for his careful translation of hieroglyphic texts (many of which are still used today), and his sponsorship of systematic excavations. Vincent Arieh Tobin's recent characterization of Breasted's <i>Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt </i>is a case in point: "Although published originally in 1912, this work is still a classic study of Egyptian religion and myth and is well worth a careful reading."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  H. D.'s critics have tended to elide scholarly Egyptology with Budge—a problematic position given his compromised status within the academy. </p>

<p>Breasted's disagreements with Budge did not extend to countering the prevailing scholarly opinion about race, which separated Egypt from Africa and by inference from Negro America. Although Breasted positioned Egypt as foundational to Western culture, he mirrored the contemporary racial climate in assigning whiteness to its ancient inhabitants. We see this ideology as late as 1941, when <i>National Geographic </i>illustrations for "Daily Life in Ancient Egypt" depict its inhabitants as "a light-colored, not even very suntanned people," as Bruce Trigger notes.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Breasted considered the Egyptians to be part of what he terms "The Great Northwest Quadrant," a geographical area which includes the Mediterranean and whose inhabitants "as far back as we <b></b> </p>

know anything  about prehistoric men, have all been members of the white race." This Quadrant is "bordered on the east by the Mongoloids and south by the Negroes." While Breasted admits that these two groups "occupy an important place in the modern world," he denies any contribution on their part to the development of <i>Western</i> civilization. He does allow that the Chinese branch of the Mongoloids created an "impressive" civilization in their own right, but equates the Negroes with the "teeming black world of Africa," who neither influenced nor were influenced by Egypt—and thus lacked 

<b></b>

 civilization (<i>CC, </i>43–45). Such racial constructions grow out of debates within mid-nineteenth-century Egyptology which, as Malini Johar Schueller argues, "generated anxieties about the capabilities of different races in the United States."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Breasted's separation of Egypt from Black Africa and the (American) Negro would surely have facilitated his acceptance among the general public. </p>

<p>Establishing Egyptology as a university discipline in the United States, Breasted developed the influential New Past theory, which promoted Egypt as foundational for western civilization. For Breasted the New Past made it possible to view "an imposing panorama of the human career in a vista of successive ages such as no earlier generation has ever been able to survey."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As the first link in the chain, Egypt was responsible for nothing less than "the emergence of civilization, the most important event that has yet occurred in the universe so far as it is known to us" (<i>CC,</i> 7). Thus Breasted never equated ancient Egypt with primitivism—a feature that distinguishes his work from Freud's recapitulation theory, as well as from Schnapp, Shanks, and Tiew's view that archaeology posits "evolutionary schemes" of "an earlier, more primitive stage."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  In particular Breasted praised Egypt's invention of hieroglyphic writing as "having had a greater influence in uplifting the human race than any other intellectual achievement in the career of man" (<i>CC, </i>61). This foregrounding of Egypt marks a major shift from the traditional emphasis on the Classical past or Biblical tradition as the sources of Western civilization—what we might term the old past. </p>

<p>Rather than requiring the direct contact advocated by Smith, the New Past viewed civilization as a "rising trail" extending from Egypt to modern America. Breasted distilled this theory in his design for the sculpted tympanum over the entrance to the Oriental Institute, titled "The East Teaching the West (<a href="#3"> 3</a>)." The two central res are, on the left, an Egyptian scribe (identifiable by the writing paraphernalia slung over his shoulder), and on the right, a WPA-styled American man. The scribe and his important gift (writing) represent the East; note the men from other ancient civilizations (Persian, Assyrian, Babylonian) shown behind him. The scribe also holds a fragment from a temple wall—symbol of the importance of monumental architecture as both an enduring surface for writing, and a major element of human achievement in its own right. The significance of Egyptian architecture is further emphasized by the choice of a lotus bud column capital (lying behind the Egyptian scribe), which is identical to those from the Amun temple complex at Karnak. While a pyramid would be a more iconic choice for representing Egypt (there is a small pyramid on the left side), Breasted chooses a column to further link Egypt and the West. Columns, important elements of the Greco-Roman architectural vocabulary, are ultimately derived from Egypt. </p>

<p>The sun with suspended ankh symbols and rays ending in human hands fills the central area above both res. This image comes from the religion of the eighteenth-dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten, revered by Breasted and many Western scholars of his time as the first monotheist. Breasted's march of civilization is thus connected to the Hebrew/Western conception of God the Father. By placing his sculptural decoration in a tympanum, Breasted also alludes to Christian sacred architecture. He saw in the Amun temple's Hypostyle Hall the source of "the columned nave and side aisles" of European 

<b></b>

 cathedrals: "Egypt furnished the later world with this beautiful architectural form."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Indeed, the use of relief sculpture in the tympanum is in itself a tribute to Egyptian cultural primacy, since the practice of decorating buildings in this way goes back from cathedrals to Classical and Near Eastern civilizations, and ultimately to Egypt. </p>

<p>The Egyptian scribe dwarfs the representatives of the other Near Eastern civilizations just as, according to the New Past theory, Egypt's civilization surpassed theirs. Similarly, American man's size suggests that his civilization will (or is) surpassing the Western civilizations of Greece and Rome depicted behind him on the right. While the American Man and Egyptian scribe are the same size, subtle stylistic devices indicate that American will surpass his Egyptian counterpart. Borrowing compositional techniques from ancient Egyptian sculpture used to express dominance, Breasted's design emphasizes American man by placing his left foot in front of the scribe's so that his bent knee intrudes into the center of the frame. In effect, modern America is poised to assume ancient Egypt's legacy and continue the march of civilization. As Breasted sees it, Egypt offers a site through which his own newer, American culture can enter the panorama of history, ultimately usurping Europe's position and becoming the culmination of Western civilization's development. </p>

<p>H. D.'s writing shows an awareness of debates within Egyptology—especially those involving nationality, geography and race. The name of her "famous Egyptologist" in "Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt" (Bodge-Grafton) combines Budge and Grafton Elliot Smith. This wordplay suggests not only that Budge "botched" his interpretations, as Sarah Witte has noted, but also signals ideological splits within the field of Egyptology more generally.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Ironically, this fictional Egyptologist represents "the amethyst 

<b></b>

 Athenian values" from which the protagonist—his Classically-trained research assistant—must free herself. He leaves with his "disappointed party" when the Tutankhamun excavations force him to modify his "monumental and final volume" (<i>P, </i>190). Although she does not invoke Breasted directly, H. D.'s rendering of Bodge-Grafton intersects with his Egypto-modernist departures from Classical frameworks.  </p>

<p>H. D.'s conceptions of ancient Egypt were more fluid than Breasted's, shifting back and forth between Eastern and African, white and black. In the "Secret Name" story, Egypt straddles Eastern and African inflections. A bejeweled Orientalism infuses Helen Fairwood's account of Amenophis II's burial chamber, which H. D. res as "a moon opal" housing the "exquisite gem, black opal" of the pharaoh's body. The protagonist likens this cultural "inheritance" to another opal fixed on her forehead, appropriating Eastern culture for herself as Miller has argued. At the same time, Fairwood's sense of being in Africa makes her feel "comforted" because she feels that its "unfamiliar" and "innumerable" stars place her closer to the sun—and thus closer to the source of divinity. Godhood as well as racial difference make Egypt seem "another planet" (<i>P, </i>183, 211, 226). In <i>Tribute to Freud,</i> H. D.'s dream re of an ancient Egyptian princess hovers between definite Eastern inflections (she wears an Indian sari) and racial ambiguity (she is a "dark lady"). As Friedman has argued, H. D.'s linking of dark and female others reflects a "modernism of the 'scattered remnant'" that sometimes breaks with Eurocentric racial hierarchies.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The protagonist of <i>Helen in Egypt</i> "blacken[s] her face like the prophetic <i>femme noire</i> of antiquity" (<i>HE,</i> 15)―an act which, as Susan Edmunds suggests, renders a black Egyptian Helen through "a moment of actual racial conversion."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In her most multiracial ration—and H. D.'s starkest contrast from Breasted—the African-American maid character in<i> HER</i> manifests ancient Egypt, as well as Roman and Etruscan attributes; this combination departs from both popular and academic versions of ancient Egypt.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  H. D.'s mergings of black Africa with Classical antiquity intersect somewhat with the Afrocentrism that Cheikh Anta Diop posited in his 1951 thesis, which considered Egypt to be the first black civilization. While it would be going too far to label H. D.'s Egypto-modernism Afrocentric, it does avoid some of the rigid racial distinctions that Martin Bernal has traced in Western scholarship on ancient Egypt and Classical antiquity.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Consequently, H. D.'s Egypt will never rest squarely on either side of the dualities with which her contemporaries defined it. H. D.'s model of cultural influence was not as linear as Breasted's because, as Gregory has noted, it involved "dissemination, dispersion, and diaspora," but neither was it as diffuse as Smith's.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
The American Nile
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Although Breasted and H. D. approached Egypt from their respective vantage points of cross-Atlantic intellectual movements—modernist Egyptology and art—their American national identities played a more significant role in their perceptions than many critics acknowledge. Breasted's writings especially convey a sense that Americans 

<b></b>

 are uniquely suited to perceive cultural kinship with the ancient Egyptians. This results not only from an imperialist belief in "Egypt as Western inheritance," as Miller notes, but also from each writer's transposition of America's mythic West onto the expansiveness of Karnak.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For Breasted and H. D., Egypt was not "the 'Gateway to India'" and "foothold" that it constituted for Britain and Continental Europe.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Although neither embraced the idea of Egyptian independence, both writers give negative impressions of British soldiers and officials in their accounts of archaeological sites. In his journals, for example, Breasted wrote of "the fundamental Philistinism of the British government"; he was especially angry that a Nile dam project would ruin Ptolemaic relics (qtd. in <i>PP, </i>143). H. D. diminishes British characters in "Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt." As noted above, Bodge-Grafton is expelled from the story when his research is disproved. Another minor character, Jerry Cope, sports "a totally overdone school-boy affectation," engaging in "monkey-like" antics that break the spell of Karnak's Amun temple (<i>P,</i> 212). More pertinent to the story, Helen Fairwood will ultimately reject as guide and companion the British Captain Rafton, Great War veteran and Public Works administrator in Cairo. In short the British characters are either ridiculed or rejected, thus clearing space for an American reappraisal of Egypt's ancient sites. Both find Egypt's cultural legacy especially significant during a period of shifting cultural hegemony to the United States. </p>

<p>The title of Charles Breasted's biography of his father—<i>Pioneer to the Past</i>—reflects the Egyptologist's sense of Western civilization as a "rising trail" leading westward to America. Early on the biographer characterizes his father as "a lone young American Egyptologist pitted against the rather self-superior complacency of Old World scholarship" (<i>PP,</i> 65). As Gerry Scott explains, the fact that Europe rather than America played the "major role" in discoveries, excavations, and epigraphy often prompted a discourse of "adventurous travel" rather than scientific inquiry.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  As pioneer to Egypt's past, Breasted also faced the challenge of steering his fellow citizens into regions largely unknown to them except in the popular imagination: "In America, Egypt really did not exist at all—and here was I, proposing single-handedly to introduce it into a Middle Western community which for the most part did not even know the origin of the names Cairo, Illinois, and Memphis, Tennessee" (qtd. in <i>PP,</i> 85). His solution to this dilemma would link the rise of Egyptian civilization to American Manifest Destiny. "Just as in America," he asserted before the American Historical Association in 1928, Egypt had forged "a great society" from the "wilderness." Clearing indigenous peoples from the American West, Breasted's address reinscribes constructions of an antithetical East to justify a "New Crusade" of "scientific effort in the ancient Orient." Breasted sought to inspire recruits ("modern pilgrims") for the Oriental Institute's archaeological surveys, so he extolled his audience to "set their faces to the East." And yet Breasted's sense of "returning to ancestral shores" also implies kinship with Egypt, so that going East opens up a new American frontier.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  One might dismiss Breasted's nationalism as a rhetorical device to open the hearts and pockets of his American audience, but it proves a major trope in his writing as a whole. In <i>The Dawn of Conscience,</i> for example, 

<b></b>

 Breasted interposes the Biblical world as an intermediate phase between ancient Egypt and "modern Man," who was best exemplified by America (<i>DC,</i> 13). Throughout his career, he drew consistent parallels between Egypt (fertile ground for the world's first civilization) and America (the next great step in the West's development).  </p>

<p>H. D. also perceived traveling to Egypt as a kind of homecoming, but for her the issue of Americanness is more vexed because of her extended expatriatism. She constructs an American Nile most fully when depicting the ways in which archaeological sites stimulate Helen Fairwood's awareness of her latent national identity. For much of the narrative, H. D.'s protagonist occupies a transnational identity that shifts on the ancient plane between Greece and Egypt, and on the modern plane between America and England. Just as she initially represses her newfound admiration of Egypt, Fairwood also represses her Americanness. For example, she refuses to join in Jerry Cope's attempts at American slang, and recoils when Mary Thorpe's mother speaks confidentially to her in the manner of "any American." Repelled by the party of nouveau-riche American tourists and their "ice-and-lemonade civilisation," Fairwood nonetheless concedes that New York "couldn't in the march of civilisations be brushed aside." Thus like Breasted, H. D. sees the U.S. as the West's emergent civilization. Fairwood will also come to acknowledge the American sensibility that has traveled with her: "Here in Egypt across her room in Luxor, America, herself gazed, as in the mirror a moment since at herself. It faced her, herself, her own school; names" (<i>P, </i>195, 185, 199). Ultimately she is drawn to Mary Thorpe not only because of her gender, the reason other critics have emphasized, but also because of their shared nationality. In fact, Fairwood grounds this link by thinking of her young compatriot as "Maryland." </p>

<p>Mary's presence prompts Helen Fairwood to envision an American Nile on both of her visits to Karnak. She frames her first entry through the Avenue of the Sphinxes with "the gigantic stretches" of her childhood New Jersey shore: "the incurve of the sand about these sphinxes is somehow familiar." (This passage anticipates H. D.'s plea for the god Amen-Ra to take her "home" to the Nile in <i>Trilogy.</i>) Leaving the site, Fairwood feels that "eventually one must surely reach a sea, the rim of a New Jersey seacoast." Her second visit to Karnak, this time with Mary as her sole companion, triggers iconic images of the American West. Fairwood sees the two American women as characters in "some Wild West show" who had ridden "across strange fields where buffalo were grazing." Significantly, it is with Mary that Fairwood finally achieves a fully satisfying encounter with monumental Egypt. The two of them, Helen perceives, constitute a feminized version of the American Western hero: "this type, this American, beaten and weathered machine type, thin as rails, steel-bone and sinew, that mounted ponies and endured the change of tropic and zero weather. . . " <i>(P, </i>203–4, 218, 235, 231). Like Breasted's sense of himself as a pioneer, H. D.'s characterization of Helen and Mary reflects the "distinctly American trait" of rugged individualism that Scott sees inflecting American approaches to Egyptology in the nineteenth century.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Paradoxically, the closing of the American frontier in 1890 expanded its mythic boundaries in the American imagination, enabling Breasted and H. D. to invoke it as a means of extending America's past to ancient Egypt.

<h1 class="sec-headA">
Advocating for a New Past
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Although monumental Egypt prompted H. D. and especially Breasted to articulate their American identities, these advocates for Egyptian cultural primacy often assumed that their respective audiences would disagree with them. This perception arose in part from the fundamental role the Bible played in U.S. nationalism. According to his son's biography, Breasted's textbook <i>Ancient Times</i> was denounced by Scopes Trial prosecutor William Jennings Bryan for supposedly destroying the nation's Christian faith (<i>PP,</i> 230). The New Past Theory attributes nothing less than the development of moral conscience to ancient Egypt rather than the traditional Biblical sources. In reading Egyptian literature, Breasted found that "the Egyptians had possessed a standard of morals far superior to that of the Decalogue over a thousand years before the Decalogue was written." He also relates his boyhood puzzlement at the lack of a commandment against lying, considering this a fundamental flaw in Biblical morality (<i>DC, </i>xii). H. D. effects a similar revaluation of ancient Egypt in <i>Trilogy,</i> which asserts that the Egyptian god Amun "is our Christos" and "not at all like Jehovah."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Working through layers of ancient Mediterranean cultures in the first section, H. D. reveals the Egyptian precedents for Classical and Christian symbols; for example, Pharaoh's "erect king-cobra crest" lies beneath both the Greek caduceus and the Christian Tau cross with Brazen Serpent (<i>T,</i> 13). H. D. "turned repeatedly to Egypt as a symbol for the sacred," as Friedman notes."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  And like Breasted, her Biblical knowledge enhanced rather than diminished her appreciation of ancient Egyptian spirituality. </p>

<p>H. D. anticipates considerable resistance to her fullest articulations of Egypto-modernism: <i>Trilogy</i> and <i>Helen in Egypt.</i> Like other "impure" influences that Gregory and Cassandra Laity have discussed (Alexandrian Hellenism and Decadent Romanticism, respectively), her advocacy for Egypt would prove suspect to Eliot and Pound.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  In <i>Trilogy</i> the speaker-as-scribe defends ancient Egypt from an adversarial "you" that views Isis as "a harlot," sacred symbols as "charms," and divine Egyptian headdress as "trivial/intellectual adornment" (<i>T, </i>5, 14). In <i>Helen in Egypt,</i> all the male characters accost the protagonist for her new Egyptian identity. Achilles rebukes Helen in the very first section: "O cursèd, O envious Isis, / you—you—a vulture, a hieroglyph" . Paris perceives that Helen is tainted with "Egyptian incense," while Theseus fears that Egyptian influences destroy Greek rationality: </p>

<p class="continued">As home to the Minotaur, Crete's Labyrinth is domain of darkness, bestiality, and corruption—the antithesis to Helen's (and H. D.'s) sacred Amun temple. Significantly, Theseus's labyrinthine image of Egypt also intersects with a major point of contention 

<b></b>

 for archaeologists in the modernist period. While some saw Crete as Europe's first autonomous civilized society, Breasted and others posited Egypt as the island's civilizing force (CC, 89). Although H. D.'s advocacy for Egypt is always put on the defensive, her Egypto-Modernism allowed her to write outside the confines of Classical warrior band myths. As Dianne Chisholm points out, H.D.'s revisionary writing, unlike Western literary history, is not dominated by the Greek text."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Thus it is her Egyptian influences, as well as her female protagonist, that make <i>Helen in Egypt</i> an alternative modern epic. </p>

<p>Egypt's ancient archaeological sites—especially Karnak—gave H. D. and Breasted a generative space in which to create new pasts unencumbered by the weight of traditional Eurocentric frameworks. For them Egypt became paradoxically ancient and new: "the same—different—the same attributes, / different yet the same as before," as H. D. writes (<i>T,</i> 105). The need for a regenerative past became more urgent in the face of global war, prompting Breasted and H. D. to view Egypt as a source of spiritual stability. Stricken by the carnage of World War I and cognizant of the emerging crisis in Europe during the early 1930s, Breasted wrote <i>The Dawn of Conscience</i> as an antidote to the horrors of war. In the foreword to this history of moral thought, he asserts: "The World War has now demonstrated the appalling possibilities of man's mechanical power of destruction. The only force that can successfully oppose it is the human conscience" that originated in Egypt (<i>DC,</i> ix). With Europe on the verge of ruin once more, Breasted sees an unscathed America ready to inherit an older source—and renew the West's usable past. If the Old World and its past are in effect dead, "the stone papyrus" of Karnak will "continue to prophesy," as H. D. writes in <i>Trilogy.</i> Excavating backward from Blitz-torn London through the remains of Pompeii and ultimately to Egypt, H.D. senses that Karnak's inscribed hieroglyphs still "pursue unalterable purpose." When the speaker-scribe asserts that "Pompeii has nothing to teach us," she means not only that Londoners know too much of airborne destruction, but also that the Classical past proves insufficient for facing it—and for healing what will remain (<i>T,</i> 3, 4). As a whole <i>Trilogy</i> effects a perpetual return to Egypt, beginning at Karnak and ending just before the Christian Holy Family flees from Herod to the Nile. While H. D. never discounted the legacies of Classical poetry and Hellenic beauty, Egypt allowed her war poems to "rearrange a culture in crisis," to borrow Adalaide Morris's evocative phrase.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Malleable in a way that the Classical tradition can never be, Egypto-modernism allowed Breasted and H. D. to rewrite traditional narratives of Western culture by making Egypt its source and spiritual center. In their memorial tribute to Breasted, Ludlow Bull, Ephraim Speiser and Albert TenEyck Olmstead noted: "He often said that, much as he admired the marvellous contributions of Greece to art and philosophy, he was weary of the prevalent belief among educated laymen that 'everything began with the Greeks.'"<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  H.D.'s surrogate Helen Fairwood starts off with this view, but comes to accept that "<i>The Greeks came to Egypt to learn"</i> (<i>P, </i>217). Reading H. D. through Breasted reveals that modernist Egyptology was a major influence on her career, surely as important as the psychoanalytic frameworks that have dominated H. D. studies. While Breasted was not 

<b></b>

 the only professional Egyptologist who influenced H. D., his advocacy for Egypt and the New Past is similar to the Egypto-modernist perspective she would develop after <i>Palimpsest.</i> As we have seen, ancient Egypt held plural and even conflicting meanings in popular, literary, and intellectual discourse of the modernist period—despite the immense stability of its dynastic culture across millennia. Ideologically-inflected accounts of Egypt were hardly limited to its emergence from British colonial rule. By recovering H. D.'s intersections with academic Egyptology—especially its emergence in the United States—we can situate her career more fully within modernist intellectual history. </p>

<p id="lead">Gret Palucca's dancing was recognized for its optimism and lightness; Palucca's signature movements—airborne springs, deep lunges, and high leg extensions—impressed audiences with their athletic energy. One of Mary Wigman's first students, Palucca performed in numerous group choreographies created by the modern dance pioneer in the early 1920s, but split from her mentor in 1924 to found her own rival studio in Dresden and competed with Wigman for students and fame. Unlike Wigman, who was described by the bourgeois women's magazine <i>Die Dame (The Lady) </i>as a <i>tieftänzerin,</i> or low dancer, for her deeply spiritual and symbolic work based on movements along the floor, Palucca was termed by <i>Die Dame </i>as a <i>hochtänzerin,</i> or high dancer for her airborne movements.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  And in contrast to Wigman, whose choreographies created new directions in and considerations about modernist dance, Palucca did not speak of her own dances in theoretical terms. Rather, critics noted that Palucca's rhythmic, geometric, and exuberant dancing style suggested a balance of contrasts: strength and softness, pushing out and pulling in, innocence and seriousness.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Indeed, the impressive heights of Palucca's springs, combined with her youthfully pretty appearance, extensive tour schedule, and savvy self-promotion, made Palucca one of the most recognized dancers of Germany's Weimar Republic (1918–1933). Regularly featured in mainstream women's style magazines such as <i>Die Dame </i>and <i>Uhu (The Owl),</i> Palucca served as a model of the New Woman, the media icon of the fashionably emancipated woman, whose liberation was signified, in large part, through modern movement. At the same time, Palucca 

<b></b>

 cultivated connections with the avant-garde, especially with artists. Art and dance critic Will Grohmann introduced her to the cultural elite; a Piet Mondrian painting hung in her dance studio; Palucca purchased a Paul Klee painting as a birthday gift for her husband; and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner filled sketchbooks with drawings of her solo dance rehearsals.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In other words, Palucca promoted herself as a mass-media star and an avant-garde performer. </p>

<p>Palucca brought her dancing style, popular culture fame, and art-world connections to her interactions with artists at the Bauhaus, an innovative school for art and design in Weimar Germany. A bastion of modernism, the Bauhaus endorsed artistic abstraction, in which identifiable, rative subject matter was minimized or even obliterated. Instead, Bauhaus modernism favored an emphasis on pictorial compositions of pure lines, blocks of color, and geometric shapes. Numerous modernist critics also envisioned modernism as a closed system of influence in which "art begat art" and developed without regard to external cultural forms, social issues, or political events. While such insistence on the removal of art from external forces would be impossible at the tumultuous Bauhaus, officially at least the Bauhaus asserted the primacy of modernism. Wassily Kandinsky, widely recognized as one of the first abstract painters, taught abstract art and theory to students and wrote theoretical treatises about abstract art during his tenure at the Bauhaus. "Dance Curves," an essay Kandinsky published in 1926 in which the artist created four abstract drawings influenced by four photographs of Palucca by Charlotte Rudolph, embodies the very issues of modernism promoted by the Bauhaus in the mid-1920s.  </p>

<p>Instead of sustaining this narrowly defined notion of modernism, however, I focus on the staunchly abstract artist Kandinsky, and in particular his essay "Dance Curves," in order to position a gender critique of modernism. The Kandinsky/Palucca drawings elucidate the fluidity of interchanges between the arts and modernism's openness to seeming antitheses in physical culture and women's culture, thereby contesting the binaries of high art/popular culture, masculine/feminine, and mind/body that have been asserted by numerous theorists and critics since the Enlightenment. I argue that "Dance Curves" reveals the diversity within modernism, of the interaction between these socially constructed binaries, and in particular of abstraction's relationship with gender, before the imposition of conventional hierarchies that have dominated art history since Clement Greenberg in the 1950s. </p>

<p>These binaries ran deep. Since the Enlightenment, Rene Descartes' formulation of a mind/body dichotomy has privileged the former over the latter, valuing language, writing, intellect, and the public sphere (historically associated with men) over physicality, dance, childbirth, and the home (historically associated with women). Though the definition of modernism (and its relevance for individual artists) has changed over time, modernist theory reached an apotheosis with Greenberg, whose ideas strongly informed American art, art history, and criticism from the 1950s into the 1970s. Under his tutelage American art history neglected interdisciplinary approaches to the arts and left movements preoccupied with non-painterly materials or ration out of the modernist canon. In prioritising style over subject matter and highlighting abstract rather 

<b></b>

 than rative artists, Greenberg argued for an abstract and autonomous art object, an autonomy based in the painting's emphasis on the canvas's own fundamental flatness that contested the notion—held since the Renaissance—that painting functioned as a window onto another world. For Greenberg, this form of autonomous avant-garde painting served to save culture from kitsch, a middlebrow mass culture created for bourgeois suburbanites in an increasingly capitalistic and regimented America. Though Greenberg did not discuss it in such explicit terms, the "kitsch" he most detested was coded as feminine, characterized by such sites and objects as suburban homes and melodramatic films.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Greenberg's theories, thus, insisted upon a high/low cultural divide between the arts based in part on an implied male/female binary. </p>

<p>"New art histories" since the 1970s, grounded in feminism and Marxism, have also made room for a more expansive notion of art history within visual culture; but there, too, scholars have nonetheless overlooked key aspects of this complex relationship.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In art historian Thomas Crow's analysis of modernism, modernist art engaged with and readily drew upon mass culture for subject matter, and modern art's shock effect for audiences derived in part from its disruption of assumed cultural hierarchies of "high art" and "mass culture." Envisioning a more complex dynamic between the avant-garde and mass culture, Crow interprets both cultural forms as influenced by one another, and describes how the utopian avant-garde quickly became a mainstream commodified package.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Crow's reevaluation of modernism, however, contains some glaring omissions: his emphasis on Marxist interpretations, however much they value labor and work, overlooks gender entirely; the subjects and audiences of kitsch and mass culture were historically overwhelmingly female, but Crow does not address how or why male artists appropriated objects and ideas associated with women.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  I would further argue that in Weimar German art milieus, including the Bauhaus, dance created little shock as artistic subject matter. Rather, there existed at the Bauhaus an easy mingling and mixing between art and dance. Visual artists' personal interests in dance, such as Kandinsky's, countered the modernist myth that high art developed separately from and remained uninfluenced by both popular culture and the performing arts. </p>

<p>The example of "Dance Curves" elucidates how the rigid binaries formulated by many modernists simply did not exist in practice. Mindful of her public image, Palucca presented herself as a modernist dancer concerned with abstraction, but combined with an image, on- and off- stage, that was simultaneously youthfully feminine, New Woman androgynous, and powerfully masculine. Using photographs of Palucca's performances of modernism and gender, Kandinsky freely explored her dancing as an expression of his theoretical principles based on abstraction. His very abstractions, however, revealed constructivism's relationship with masculinity and androgyny. Abstraction was (and is) not gender neutral, and in the 1920s it was infused by the complex debates about the New Woman, gender identity, and women's emancipation at the Bauhaus and beyond. <b></b></p>

<p>It should come as little surprise that Palucca would seek out Kandinsky and the Bauhaus. She and her husband, Fritz Bienert, used his impressive family connections as entrée to the innovative school; his sister, Ise, studied at the Bauhaus and provided her close friend Palucca with a distinct understanding of the institution; their mother, Ida, was widely recognized for her illustrious modern art collection, including extensive holdings of paintings by Bauhaus faculty. Palucca also solicited artists' advice, purchased their art, and taught Bauhaus art theory in her dance classes.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Moreover, Palucca visited the Bauhaus. First performing for students and faculty on March 18, 1925, and then on several other occasions in the late 1920s, she posed for photographs, socialized with the faculty, and partied with the students. Extant photographs portray warm friendships between Palucca and Bauhaus masters and students. In one example, Palucca, Kandinsky, and his wife Nina stand on the roof of the Kandinsky home and smile as they look into the distance. In another, Palucca stands in a line of six people, including Paul Klee and his wife Lily, and they humorously link their arms and raise their knees as if dancing in a revue kickline. Student photography showcases Palucca's liveliness and modern appearance, portraying her climbing onto and springing off the Bauhaus roofs.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  These visual cues imply that Palucca was personally close to the artists and welcomed into the institution. </p>

<p>The appearance of easy artistic closeness in these photographs, however, belies the tumultuousness felt throughout the institution, created by a set of diverse issues that influenced how Bauhaus artists interpreted Palucca's dancing. The timing of Palucca's first visit occurred in the middle of a major financial and political crisis at the school. A public institution, the Bauhaus relied on the state legislature for funding, and its increasingly politically right-leaning elected representatives pressured the progressive Weimar Bauhaus to close in 1925, within months of Palucca's visit, and relocate to the industrial city of Dessau. Klee, Kandinsky's closest colleague and friend at the Bauhaus, could not help but read Palucca's performance as one that momentarily unified an otherwise splintering Bauhaus community.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>   </p>

<p>On another front, contentiousness surrounded the issue of women's roles since the school's beginnings. Women actively participated in the school's vibrant daily life and were regularly photographed enjoying relaxing moments on the cafeteria terrace, but their matriculation was limited so as not to exceed the number of male students.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Once they became students at the Bauhaus, by edict of director Walter Gropius, women were encouraged to occupy separate studios from their male counterparts for the preliminary and form courses. And invariably funneled into the Weaving Workshop, the so-called Women's Class, many female Bauhaus students voiced enthusiasm for textile work and its appropriateness for women; nonetheless, these divisions reinforced gendered distinctions between the "men's work" which included sculpture and metal, and the "women's work" exclusively in textiles.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>   </p>

<p>By the time of Palucca's arrival, the official Bauhaus style had transformed from expressionism, an emotional art with its hand-drawn vibrating lines, to constructivism, 

<b></b>

  a clean precision style with non-sentimental, geometric, industrial forms. The 1923 Bauhaus exhibition's slogan, "Art and Technology: A New Unity," and the hire of constructivist photographer and leftist activist Laszló Moholy-Nagy, signaled and solidified these aesthetic shifts. Even expressionist advocate Kandinsky tilted his art in a harder-edged direction; the precise straight lines and perfected arches of Kandinsky's "Dance Curves" are products of his changed artistic slant, a style considerably different from that which he painted before World War I and described in his 1912 treatise, <i>Concerning the Spiritual in Art.</i><sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Bauhaus artists did respond favorably to Palucca's dancing and visits, but their reactions were complicated by these tense political, gender, and aesthetic dynamics. </p>

<p>Perhaps attuned to these myriad concerns, Palucca's first Bauhaus performance evening showcased her talents, but did so in a way that would have provided diverse points of identification, desire, and comfort for her audience. For one, Palucca danced to musical accompaniment. The titles of the works reveal aspects of their style: "Con Brio (Guarracha)" was a Latin-inspired dance, "Molto Allegro" was inspired by the structures and tempos of classical music, and other choreographies were performed to percussion instruments.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  She choreographed with music in mind, in contrast to other modernist dancers, such as Wigman, who performed to percussive sounds but considered such accompaniment a secondary (or even tertiary) factor in the overall performance. But while such attention to musical accompaniment might have been considered nontraditional in modernist dance circles, Kandinsky and Klee would have found it wholly valid, for her engagement with classical music and musical structures paralleled their own pictorial and theoretical explorations of music. Kandinsky concerns himself with sound and music throughout his 1926 treatise <i>Point and Line to Plane,</i> for example, envisioning points as notes on a sheet of music and geometric conrations within picture planes as "lyrical" and "harmonious."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Palucca also offered her Bauhaus audience multiple and varied performances of gender. Unlike her mentor Wigman, Palucca did not contest traditional structures of gendered spectatorship. She chose not to follow Wigman's example of masks and billowy costumes that obscured her body, but instead sported shorts and short skirts that revealed her toned legs. At a Bauhaus that encouraged women's artistic work as long as it was contained within gender-defined parameters, Palucca's ease with revealing her body reinforced dance's historical associations with the corporeal and femininity. A review of the dance evening in a local paper supports this perspective, and focuses on Palucca's attractiveness: "Wasn't it rhythmic gymnastics that the young, pretty artist with the fabulously trained body and bob hairstyle presented on stage?"<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Palucca's legs, visible in so many of Rudolph's photographs of the dancer, highlight the athleticism of her dancing and her corporeal presence. Only twenty-three years old, Palucca was easy on the eyes, yet her Bauhaus audience may have had differing perspectives on her performance; the male students and professors may have found her attractiveness desirable, whereas the female students may have envisioned Palucca as a living, breathing New Woman, a star with a style and lifestyle to which they too aspired. </p>

<p>However, Palucca's appeal vis-à-vis gender constituted more than youthful femininity. For one, Palucca danced solo, a decisive move that associated her with masculinity. 

<b></b>

 Given that Palucca had performed in Wigman's group choreographies and had trained her own students to perform in such formats, Palucca's choice is noteworthy. Male stars such as Vaslav Nijinsky became the focus of modern ballet narratives and utilized the space of the entire stage for themselves alone; others, like Rudolf von Laban, served as charismatic leaders of younger female students and devotees. This concept of the solo star as masculine stands in contrast to the performed "women's community" many envisioned in the group choreography.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  In addition, the "bob hairstyle" mentioned in the review refers to the <i>Bubikopf,</i> the cropped haircut widely recognized as the quintessence of the New Woman's androgyny. Here, however, Palucca's androgyny is expressed neither as liberation nor as transgressive social threat, but contained as an attractive style. </p>

<p>Palucca's own self-fashionings and self-proclamations as an emancipated woman were undercut by the behind-the-scenes machinations of her husband. Following the Weimar premiere, Fritz Bienert strategized how Bauhaus masters could lend their voices to the dancer's promotional materials. Active in steering her career, he expanded the Palucca dance-school brochure for 1926, <i>Palucca Tanz (Palucca Dance),</i> to include staged photographs of Palucca springing in soft-lit studio settings and excerpted quotations from glowing press reviews. Bienert also solicited statements by prominent intellectuals and artists, such as Kandinsky, Klee, and Moholy-Nagy, Bauhaus artists likely to make positive proclamations and analyses of his wife's work.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  The Palucca School's secretary sent out form letters to the artists, but whereas Klee returned a brief statement to the secretary, Bienert quickly took the reins of the Kandinsky essay.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Bienert encouraged the artist to turn his statement into a multi-page essay and loaned Kandinsky photographs by Rudolph upon which he based his four drawings. The completed version of "Dance Curves" was enclosed in a letter sent directly to Bienert and published six months later and verbatim in <i>Das Kunstblatt (The Art Paper), </i>one of the most illustrious cultural journals of the Weimar era.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Kandinsky also included Palucca in his Bauhaus theoretical treatise, <i>Point and Line to Plane, </i>completing the manuscript within weeks of submitting "Dance Curves."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  "Dance Curves" was also positioned as the first text the 1926 <i>Palucca Dance </i>brochure, in effect prioritizing Kandinsky's words and drawings over those of other artists and critics.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Much as "Dance Curves" suggests Beinert and Palucca's strategic maneuverings, it likewise elucidates Palucca's importance for Kandinsky as an artist. Her dancing put his pictorial theories into physical practice. Palucca's prettiness and musical accompaniment may have made her performance more approachable, but Kandinsky also seems to have envisioned something profound in her dancing forms. He chose to render her as an amalgamation of simple lines, a simplicity that at first obscures the complex correlations in the drawings and dances between abstraction, masculinity, and the modern woman of the 1920s.

<p>"Complete mastery is impossible without precision," Kandinsky declares at the beginning of the essay, implying that artistic achievement—for dancer and artist alike—is found in the harmony and balance of clear geometric relationships ("DC," 520). Working from still photographs, Kandinsky analyzes Palucca's dancing as compositional arrangements of clean, crisp lines within pictorial planes. At first glance, the title "Dance Curves" is ironic. Kandinsky's drawings are remarkably still for dance imagery, imagery that, given their subject matter, could appear more energetic; and Kandinsky employed straight or zig-zag lines far more often than curves and arcs. As for the photographs, they are all staged in soft-lit studio settings, with three of the four portraying the dancer still, in positions she could have held for an extended period of time. None of them portray Palucca performing her signature springs. The slight blurriness of each photograph creates an image of a softer (i.e. more feminine) Palucca; but the blur also implies that she had moved, as if these carefully orchestrated promotional photographs were in fact quick snapshots of a dynamically moving dancer. </p>

<p>The purpose of Kandinsky's drawings, the artist writes in "Dance Curves," is to examine "the simplicity of the overall form" of Palucca's precise poses and movements, and how "the structure is based upon form in the large" ("DC," 520). That is, Kandinsky focuses exclusively on the lines and curves that form the clear and fundamental basis of the dancing body's pose and movement; "dead material," such as costuming, obfuscates these fundamentals and is thus omitted. Often Kandinsky's drawings are recognizable as human res only when compared to the accompanying photographs, but Kandinsky is concerned with abstraction, not a pictorial representation of the human body. The drawings' lines, zig-zags, and curves imply warmth and coolness, direction and orientation, and tension and movement; the arrangement of these simple lines within these four picture planes creates complex relationships of drama and balance, relationships that served as the bases for both Kandinsky's art and Palucca's dancing. Palucca's balance of angularity versus smooth overlapping curves, for example, creates an asymmetrical harmony of weights and counterweights, in keeping with Kandinsky's theories. Kandinsky drew lines that converge and separate, evoking the "push-pull" dynamic found in Palucca's choreographies. </p>

<p>To turn to specific examples, two of the pairings are of generally vertical res composed of lines instead of curves (<a href="#1"> 1</a>,2,7,8). As Kandinsky writes in <i>Point and Line to Plane, </i>a line "is the trail left by the point in motion. Hence it comes about through movement—indeed, by destroying the ultimately self-contained repose of the point" ("PLP," 572). None of the lines in "Dance Curves" are straight vertical lines, a type of line that for Kandinsky "has a tendency to run straight to infinity," but the pairings here include a high concentration of vertically oriented diagonal lines. Because diagonal lines combine horizontality (i.e. cold) with verticality (i.e. warm), Kandinsky envisions diagonal lines as an "infinite cold-warm possibility of movement in its most concise form" ("PLP," 572, 574). Palucca's feet are firmly planted on the stage, such that she appears to barely move, but the "cold-warm" dynamic in the diagonals creates tension, or a "force inherent in an element." When Kandinsky combines that tension with the lines' direction, he delineates the fundamental components of movement ("PLP," 

<b></b>

 573). In other words, Palucca's own dancing re might appear barely to move in the photograph, but the diagonals in Kandinsky's drawings imply that it does.  </p>

<p>This implication of movement is extended and amplified in the zig-zags of res <a href="#7">7</a> and <a href="#8">8</a>, zig-zags which, for Kandinsky, take the "warm-cold" dynamic of the diagonal line and extend it on a larger scale, the result of which comes from "the pressure of two forces" ("PLP," 584). The drawing, according to Kandinsky's theories, also emphasizes warmth. The caption reads, in part, "Gradual development from below, with the angles becoming continually more acute" ("PLP," 523). For Kandinsky, the acute angle is a warm angle (in comparison to a right angle or an obtuse angle); moreover, the upper (or "above") section of the picture plane "conjures . . . a feeling of lightness, of emancipation, and ultimately of freedom" ("PLP," 588, 639). It is as if the zig-zagging lines become warmer and lighter as they move up the picture plane in <a href="#8">re 8</a>—a warmth and lightness that also coincides with Palucca's own dancing as one of lightness and optimism. </p>

<p>In the second pairing (<a href="#3">. 3</a>,4), the "curves" of "Dance Curves" are pictorial distillations of arcs created by modern dance, not the curves of the dancing female body. Without physicality or sensuality, the drawing—of three intersecting curves and two converging lines—suggests a human re arching her back only when compared to the photograph, but for Kandinsky, the curve expresses "the extreme pliability of the body" ("DC," 521). For Kandinsky, a curve is a "straight line in motion," created by sideways pressure on a straight line ("PLP," 596–7). The combination of curves and angles in <a href="#4">re 4</a>, however, create the tension Kandinsky strove for in his drawings. The curves oriented towards the vertical, such as the long central curve suggesting Palucca's supporting leg and torso, evoke warmth; the horizontally oriented curves, such as the uppermost curve implying Palucca's arms, indicate cold. Furthermore, the overall composition within the picture plane is weighted towards the left and the upper ("above") section of the picture plane; both of these areas, as with <a href="#8">re 8</a>, imply "lightness," "emancipation," and "freedom." The horizontal and vertical orientations, curves and sharp angles, and warm and cool connotations, create an image of motion and tension. </p>

<p>Palucca and Kandinsky shared a belief in a geometric foundation for an unemotional art. An example of Palucca in a lunge position articulates how her attention to geometric relationships extended into the smallest parts of her body (<a href="#5">. 5</a>, 6). It is the only Kandinsky drawing to include fingers, and in "Dance Curves" Kandinsky pays the dancer the highest compliment for her use of them: "Observe the exact positioning of the fingers as an example of precision in every last detail" ("DC," 522). Such praise of precision in dance res prominently in "<i>Point and Line to Plane,"</i> where Kandinsky writes: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In dance the whole body, in modern dance every finger, draws lines with a very precise expression. The "modern" dancer moves across the stage in exact lines, which he incorporates as an essential element into the composition of his dance (Sacharaov). Apart from which, the dancer's entire body, right down to the fingertips, is at every moment a continuous linear composition (Palucca).</p>

<p class="continued">

 Comprised of diagonal lines and curves, the fingers echo the curves of her head and neck and the strong diagonal of her arm. The finger positioning's clean precision, however, negates a central purpose of the hand in early twentieth-century Germanic visual culture as an expressive tool. In expressionist art and film, hands were to inspire a viewer to sympathetically identify with an individual's angst. In Austrian Egon Schiele's self portraits, for example, his fingers frame his eyes and face, focusing a viewer's attention on his performed tortured emotional state. Here, instead, the stylized hand suggests Palucca's divergence from Wigman's spiritual dances, and Kandinsky's own shifts away from expressionism, both towards a precise, angular, Bauhaus style. </p>

<p>Beyond the fingers, the lunge in <a href="#6">re 6</a> picks up the theme of tension suggested by the other drawings in distinct ways. In Rudolph's photograph (<a href="#5"> 5</a>), the supporting leg in Palucca's lunge is clearly at a right angle; in Kandinsky's drawing, it is at a slightly acute angle, with the knee slightly extended over the foot. These seemingly minor distinctions are important to how these "bodies" are perceived. For Kandinsky, the right angle is the coldest geometric form, for "it divides a square surface relentlessly into four parts" ("PLP," 587). Kandinsky adds some warmth to what would otherwise seem utterly cold to him. In addition, the torso and head's strong upward lunge orientation towards the upper left, like the other drawings, adds to "a feeling of lightness," but that upward orientation is mitigated by the strong downward thrust of the arm and leg. This added emphasis on the lower (or "below") portion of the picture plane signifies for Kandinsky "density, weight, bondage" ("PLP," 640). The strong force of the lines in Kandinsky's drawings, in fact, balances out the composition through an asymmetrical harmony, contrasting the lighter, softer vertical curves of the torso against the forceful lines of the lunging legs and arm.  </p>

<p>Despite Kandinsky's clear praise of the precise geometry of Palucca's positioning in the Rudolph photographs, the text of "Dance Curves" suggests that Kandinsky approaches Palucca's actual dancing unemotionally, even clinically. Nowhere in "Dance Curves" does the artist write of intuitive aspects of the dance, musical accompaniment, spectatorial reception, or of his personal friendship with the dancer. Kandinsky also does not indicate that he saw Palucca perform live; the text and drawings of "Dance Curves" are based entirely on the Rudolph photographs, as if seeing her perform—and experiencing her physical presence—was unimportant to his current analysis. Palucca's name is mentioned only twice in the essay proper, as "Palucca's dances" and "Palucca's art," and then as labels leading the captions underneath each of the four pictures. I emphasize these rare (and, frankly, tangential) usages of Palucca's name in the text to illustrate the emotionally distant tenor of "Dance Curves." The tone is also ironic given the artist's relationship with the dancer. Bienert actively sought to bring Palucca and Kandinsky together for the <i>Palucca Dance </i>brochure, but the dancer and artist had been well acquainted for at least a year before her Weimar premiere. Kandinsky also helped Palucca to expand her social and cultural circle, and according to Palucca's reminiscences, she and Kandinsky shared a warm, father-daughter relationship.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In other words, the distant tenor in "Dance Curves" was not a reflection of their relationship, but instead conveyed an attitude appropriate for the art of constructivism.<b></b> </p>

<p>
 Central to constructivism is its emphasis on technology, and throughout "Dance Curves" Kandinsky writes of the technological means for depicting dance. Kandinsky writes, "first and foremost, the precise structuring of individual moments . . . can be captured by instantaneous photography," as if his own working processes require the mediation of technology ("DC," 520). At the same time, Kandinsky saw photography as fundamentally limited, "show[ing] stiff, abruptly cut-off forms," that cannot capture the movement of dance (or as Kandinsky phrases it, the "development of the form"). Instead, Kandinsky advocates the filming of dance "by slow-motion photography," but for the purposes of permitting a fuller "precise examination of this precise dancing" ("DC," 522). In basing his drawings so exclusively on technological reproductions rather than the live experiences of performance, Kandinsky describes Palucca's dancing as if it were two dimensional, comprised of "simple curve[s]," "parallel lines," and "right angles" ("DC," 520, 522). In the process, I would argue, Kandinsky overlooks the impact of a live dance performance and the technologies of the stage (such as lighting) that could contribute to the dance's effects on the spectator. </p>

<p>Further, the language of abstraction Kandinsky employed was not gender-neutral; his sketches and words were coded as masculine. More specifically, the constructivist style of "Dance Curves" has historically been aligned with masculinity, hard edges, industry, and the inorganic, in contrast to the socially constructed stereotypes of female sentimentality, decoration, and nature. As Jenny Anger details, Western art history has prioritized the "nonornamental" since Immanuel Kant; within the context of the Bauhaus, artists such as Klee worked to expunge the decorative (and, hence, the feminine) from their work and persona, but not without complications.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Kandinsky, too, feared that his paintings might be interpreted as decoration. From the beginnings of his explorations in abstraction, Rose-Carol Washton Long writes, the artist added suggestions of res, mountains, and churches in his paintings, so that a viewer would be drawn to the painting by identifying objects within the work, and thus understand Kandinsky's meanings. Pure abstraction, much as Kandinsky advocated it, could easily slide into decoration.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Washton-Long does not describe Kandinsky's concern about perceptions of the decorative in terms of gender, but I would argue that, given the gendered implications of the decorative in the 1910s cultural context, Kandinsky would likely have known of their connotations—and sought to avoid them. I would further argue that Kandinsky's foray into pure abstraction in the 1920s was possible within a constructivist aesthetic, precisely because of the style's strong associations with masculinity. Constructivism, in other words, shielded Kandinsky from the threat of the decorative and the feminine. </p>

<p>Kandinsky and Klee were not alone at the Bauhaus; rather, the fear of the decorative, expressed in part through the assertion of constructivist style, was firmly entrenched at the school. For example, Bauhaus faculty employed the terms "constructive" and "decorative" at pivotal moments in the students' careers. Toward the end of the Preliminary Course (the foundation course for design and color theory), Bauhaus faculty evaluated student work, and from those assessments the instructors decreed which workshops (metal, sculpture, bookbinding, weaving, etc.) best suited the student's style 

<b></b>

 and interests. Though the students submitted fairly similar work—much of it was of grids—the male students' work was overwhelmingly deemed "constructive," while the female students' art was described as "decorative."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Such clear associations between style and gender at the Bauhaus not only determined the students' future studies at the institution, but illustrated how fundamentally the Bauhaus faculty associated constructivism with masculinity. </p>

<p>What, then, does this masculine, constructivist style imply for Kandinsky's drawings of a woman dancer? Reading the images through Bauhaus gender politics, Kandinsky's drawings could be interpreted as an erasure of femininity, an attempt to purify art in a way that obliterates the female body entirely, especially its womanly curves, and to expel traditional associations with femininity such as nature and the domestic sphere from his art. "Dance Curves" gives Palucca a constructivist makeover, using words and drawings to, in effect, graft masculinity onto Palucca. The seeming neutrality of "Dance Curves" imposes a masculine gender onto Palucca that was not, biologically, her own. </p>

<p>Kandinsky's geometric style in "Dance Curves," however, need not be interpreted as a resistance to or rejection of Palucca's personal or dance style. Earlier in this article, I discussed how the artist and dancer shared—and agreed upon—principles of abstraction and geometric simplicity. As part of her projected persona for the press, Palucca assumed the look of the modern European New Woman, and a significant component of the New Woman's style was her androgyny, even her assumption of a masculine stance in her solo dancing. Kandinsky's drawings, stylistically coded as masculine, are in fact in keeping with Weimar descriptions of the New Woman as garçonne. Moreover, Kandinsky's compositions in "Dance Curves" favored the uppermost part of the picture plane, an area Kandinsky himself associated with "emancipation" and "freedom;" in a socio-political context, Kandinsky's words could certainly imply women's liberation. Similarly, the "density" and "weight" in <a href="#6">re 6</a> could be interpreted as masculine attributes. Palucca's androgyne appearance was often lauded by the press, as the "pretty woman with the bob haircut" and even the "young boy's face."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The angularity of her <i>Bubikopf</i> worked against the curves of the human body, but its cropped cut symbolized the New Woman's androgyny and coincided with the angularity of Kandinsky's abstracted drawings. Moreover, the sleek and modern constructivist style associates the androgynous dancing re with newness, cosmopolitanism, and urban technological innovation, which were associated with the New Woman; all of these attributes stood in contrast to contemporaneous discourses of traditional femininity. In other words, Kandinsky's abstracted dance depictions can, in fact, be read as an evocation of the cosmopolitan New Woman. </p>

<p>In addition, many New Women took on the style of constructivism for themselves, envisioning its utilization as a form of gender equality. As Briony Fer writes of Soviet Constructivism, while the "social usage [of constructivism] implied a male type—the engineer, the bourgeois specialist, the technical expert involved in industry," women employed the constructivist style to free themselves from both the traditional role of the artist as well as the constraints of gender stereotypes particular to them as women artists. Theory and practice, however, differed. Men and women might have drawn 

<b></b>

 similarly exacting lines with rulers and protractors, but unlike their male counterparts, women constructivists frequently worked in textiles. This crucial difference, among others, "brought issues of sexual difference into play."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Innovations in artistic style and concepts could not overcome the gender inequities living women experienced on a daily basis, but modernism was a utopian enterprise, and thus high potential existed for constructivism to express gender equality. </p>

<p>To return to my point at the beginning of this article, artistic style is not gender neutral. Though many artists do not consciously articulate the implications of their style choices beyond formal attributes, the art they create participates in discourses on identity and forms a visual vocabulary that codes res and environments with particular gendered, ethnic, and national attributes. Kandinsky's "Dance Curves," idealistic in its pursuit of forms, shapes, lines, and curves in their most pure and "precise" states, found them in photographs of the dancer Palucca. For Kandinsky, the result was not a total disregard of the body or the feminine, but a precarious balance between them and modernism, and a recasting of the feminine into an abstracted, masculinized androgyny. His art works through contemporaneous Weimar debates about women's liberation that, in surprising ways, pays respect to Palucca's dancing style. </p>

<p>Palucca's legacy at the Bauhaus continued in the hire of one of her former pupils, Karla Grosch, as a women's gymnastics instructor. Grosch's physical culture was pure Bauhaus, with women leaping on the Bauhaus modernist roof, and bending their bodies in perfect arches. Taking lessons from Palucca's springs and Kandinsky's "Dance Curves," gymnastics brought together the Bauhaus community's myriad hopes and needs; further, it demonstrated the centrality of the body in discourses on modernism. </p>

<p id="lead">The biggest mistake we make in discussions of "authenticity" and African American modernism is also generally the first mistake we make: the assumption that the term means something for black writers and artists qualitatively different from what it means for everyone else at the time, rather than simply meaning more, and, even then, simply more of the same. It is not that race plays no role in how "the authentic" is defined and deployed; clearly it does, as it always has for African Americans, where authenticity functions as a measure of success or as a stick with which to enforce the black artist's right relation to black people or to blackness itself. Yet the discourse of racial identity and of the authenticity of both the racial self and the art that it produces exists within and takes meaning from broader discussions about authentic identity and culture and the relative ability of anyone to create or maintain either in the kind of world taking shape in the 1910s and 1920s. This world included Harlem, New York, as well as those other U.S. cities—Philadelphia, Washington, and Chicago especially—where New Negro artists and intellectuals gathered to articulate a modern Black aesthetic.  </p>

<p>Though self-described as a rebirth of African American arts, the Harlem Renaissance fits squarely in a very American tradition that defines the authentic first as authentically <i>American</i>, by which is meant, most specifically, not British. The call for a real American literature, where "real" connotes the same qualities of natural roughness (later primitivism) and lack of popular or material success David Shumway identifies with authentic rock music, was heard loudly in the early nineteenth century and then again in the early twentieth, when it was propelled by 

<b></b>

 the twin terrors of late nineteenth-century gentility and the movement of commodity capitalism into the realm of art and literature. On both counts, African Americans had special issues. While I agree with Vincent Sherry that, even in the U.S., the difference between modernists and their 1890s predecessors "may be more willed and rhetorical than substantive or imaginative," it's worth remembering what the precedent actually was if one were a black American. With lynching at its peak, those African Americans appearing in the public arena who were not Booker T. Washington were likely instead to be either already dead or reduced to racist caricature in the service of entertainment and advertising. Most prior literary work was simply invisible, and too much of it suffered from "bombast, bathos and artificiality," as Alain Locke put it, especially when compared to the era's genuine contributions in popular music, the growing commercial success of which threatened to reveal, in the same "loser wins" logic Shumway borrows from Bourdieu, its essential inauthenticity, both racially and aesthetically.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The studied conventionality and sheer badness of much late nineteenth-century African American writing, poetry in particular, while similar in kind to the worst output of the most popular white writers at the time, was also a direct consequence of the self-censorship imposed in response to the racism of post-Reconstruction American culture (e.g., where racist notions about black women's sexuality led inexorably to the unassailable virtue of fictional heroines). The need to make a clean break with this literary and historical past was quite real for African Americans; indeed, the nostalgia Katherine Lynes identifies in Helene Johnson's "Bottled" for a past never actually experienced in a fictional Africa known largely through racist popular culture reflects the same need to blot out one's immediate past in favor of a history and identity prior to the experience of slavery and the institutionalized humiliation put into place after Reconstruction. As Lynes' analysis of the poem indicates, while this move may have been politically disadvantageous in the long run, it was not made casually or naïvely. </p>

<p>Yet the terms of the break were distressingly familiar. One of the striking aspects of the modernist reaction to both the genteel past and the prospect of a future overdetermined by the commodity form is the central role of women as markers of what is wrong in the world. As with their white counterparts, black women were red either as the black Aunt Hepsys of a past generation, puritanically resisting anything new in the name of a middlebrow aesthetic they didn't actually understand, or as the primitive brown "girls" of the current one, compulsively if passively consuming and reproducing the worst of mass culture's racial stereotypes. My own analysis of modernist authenticity concentrates on this intersection of gender, mass culture, and the discourse of the "literary" that takes shape in relation to them. The heroic and gendered refusal of socially defined conventions that animates so much modernist writing as well as the fear of falseness Roger Rothman describes—i.e., the suspicion that one or one's work is always or inevitably fake, superficial, or inauthentic—are all implicit, and sometimes ruthlessly explicit, in even the most optimistic New Negro literature (see Hughes's "The Negro Artist, and the Racial Mountain" and almost anything written by Wallace Thurman). Moreover, the double negation identified by John Paul Riquelme, where supposedly true alternatives are subsequently rejected as inauthentic, is a familiar 

<b></b>

 feature of Harlem Renaissance criticism and commentary. Indeed, the suspicion that the "new" in "New Negro" threatens always to mean merely "the latest" fully registers African American awareness of the brutal efficiency of mass culture in appropriating oppositional cultural forms and recycling them back to a public increasingly characterized by its short memory and eagerness for the new. </p>

<p>Though they disagreed about a lot, New Negroes were profoundly invested in positioning African American culture squarely within the discursive space of "the modern," in being, as Alain Locke put it in 1927, "modernists among the moderns."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Desiring to be both authentically black and authentically modern, they refused to recognize these terms as mutually exclusive. Indeed, they went much further: in the face of assertions (sometimes their own) about the primitive culture and identity of black Americans, they argued for the value of Africa

n American expressive forms on the basis of the distinctive racial "genius" that created them. They were aided in this endeavor by the work of anthropologists and cultural critics like Edward Sapir and Randolph Bourne, whose arguments linking "genuine" culture to unassimilated ethnic characteristics retained in the face of mass forms and cultural standardization seemed to point directly (though Bourne did not) to African Americans as among the few bearers of genuine culture still possible in a country otherwise succumbing to the false, "spurious" culture of the mass market and the logic of economic efficiency.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  By this reasoning, it would be possible for African Americans to argue that if an authentic American literature were still possible (Native American culture having become "extinct"), it was theirs. </p>

<p>If the rhetorical advantages of such an argument were immediately obvious, less so were the dangers, most of which are now evident in the strange career of Countee Cullen, whose meteoric rise and subsequent fall as poet laureate of the Harlem Renaissance might be seen as an object lesson in how not to be modern and black. Though he benefited at an early age from more and more positive attention than his peers, Cullen was replaced relatively quickly in literary history, first by Langston Hughes, then by Sterling Brown, as the dominant poets of the era and the most authentic or truly representative of New Negro aesthetics and goals. This fall from grace was due in part to false periodization and, more specifically, a narrative of aesthetic development that moved away from conventional lyrics associated with a degraded and feminized genteel past and toward authentically realized folk forms linked with the present and future. This narrative had even profounder effects for black women poets, who, though they accounted for roughly half of the poems published in the periodical press, disappeared almost entirely under the weight of an emergent literary culture that broadly characterized their work, as it has Cullen's, as bourgeois, racially empty, and feminine. Moreover, though the terms used to signal Cullen's failure as a modern poet referred to what some saw as his uncritical reproduction of the sterile, canonical Anglo-American literary tradition he inherited—the basis of what came to be seen as inauthentic in his work—the same charges of bourgeois and feminine racelessness reappeared with only slight modification in the widespread critiques of the "standardization" of culture and consciousness said to be a consequence of the leveling influence of mass culture on both the culturally bereft middle-class consumers it targeted and the proletarian masses they feared. 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>As this discussion suggests, much of the debate about the character of New Negro poetry was colored by the role of class in the construction of literary and aesthetic taste. This was particularly true in the 1920s, when mass culture shaped, if not entirely co-opted, that discussion for its own ends. As literature increasingly became a professional enterprise—the work of academics or avant-garde writers—the qualities in Cullen's poetry that had formerly marked it as compelling came to be seen by many as either dated or merely popular or both. Either of these would have marked Cullen and his work in turn as fundamentally inauthentic, both racially and as art, particularly among people whose growing investment in defining and policing authenticity was perhaps in direct proportion to their awareness of the impossibility of achieving it. If nothing else, the modernist emphasis on authenticity bespoke a concern with the profound inauthenticity of mass-produced cultural forms. Almost everything written in the 1910s and 1920s about "authentic" art was shaped by an unstated, because so broadly presumed, understanding of the determinant relation between mass culture and inauthenticity. Indeed, the belief that popularity guarantees the inauthenticity of art was often the one precondition for recognizing art as modernist at all. </p>

<p>This was the lesson Cullen learned the hard way, when, eleven years after his celebrated wedding to Yolanda DuBois—an event heralded in the pages of the <i>Crisis</i> by the bride's own father as "the symbolic march of young and black America"—he was derided in language that clearly signaled the gendered and racial terms of his particular failure. As Saunders Redding put it, the poetry is "effete and bloodless" and Cullen himself "a schoolroom poet whose vision of life is interestingly distorted by too much of the vicarious . . . . [His] gifts are delicate, better suited to bon mots, epigrams, and the delightfully personal love lyrics for which a large circle admire him."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Like the <i>Messenger</i> headline lamenting "'Old Maids' Make Art Backward" or the <i>New Yorker</i>'s purported "old lady in Dubuque," Redding's assessment was typical of the tone and content of much modernist criticism and indicative of the language that will characterize Cullen ever after: "effete," "lisping," and generally lacking the "virility" believed to inhere in more masculine poets such as Claude McKay.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>   </p>

<p>This reception must have been quite a shock for the poet whose early efforts in the craft prompted Alain Locke to proclaim him "A genius!" Such pronouncements were more common earlier in the century when writing a poem, almost any poem, was prima facie evidence of New Negro credentials in a culture as yet unconvinced of the existence, much less the worth, of African American poetry. As Floyd J. Calvin wrote in his review of James Weldon Johnson's 1921 <i>Book of American Negro Poetry,</i> because of "the tendency of the great 'I Ams' to subtract credit from us," Johnson is stuck "laboriously proving" what everyone already knows: that African Americans have already produced a body of poetry extending back to Phillis Wheatley."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Unfortunately, Johnson's plan to demonstrate "intellectual parity by the Negro through the production of literature and art" came at a time when literature itself was turning into a mass market industry.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  As editors like Johnson announced their projects in terms of their designs on the good opinion of readers, the proliferation of books as commodities colored the discourse of modernist writers who increasingly positioned "authentic" literary 

<b></b>

 works in opposition to this mass market, devaluing in the process most books and the people, especially women living in places like Dubuque, who read them. "Making No Compromise with the Public Taste" read the masthead of Margaret Anderson's <i>Little Review</i>, as though to emphasize this very point.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In other words, at the very moment when African American writers invested seriously in the production of black literature and the cultivation of an audience sympathetic to it, the creators of "literature," understood as an elite art capable of influencing anyone, self-consciously distanced themselves from that wide audience for whom they cultivated a studied contempt. That such an attitude itself betrayed a similarly utilitarian stance toward art seems not to have occurred to most of them. </p>

<p>That contempt was evident in the mounting disdain for poetry anthologies, which came under increasing attack in the very years when editors were compiling all those collections of Negro verse. Denigrated as the "second-hand clothes shop of poetry," literary anthologies were assailed by Laura Riding and Robert Graves in <i>A Pamphlet Against Anthologies</i> , where they castigated publishers for turning poetry "into an industrial packet-commodity" and treating what should be high art like "a commodity destined for instructional, narcotic, patriotic, religious, humorous and other household uses."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  For Riding and Graves, the offense was twofold: anthologies were not art at all, but commercial ventures conceived, like other mass market schemes, in terms of the interests of possible buyers rather than the peculiar talents of individual authors. Their net effect was to homogenize the poems included or sentimentalize them for general readers. Separated from their authors, poems were read with little or no connection to a particular poet. Instead, anthologies catered to a public accustomed to "commodities of lyric sameness" of the kind they had learned to read and recognize from other anthologies, particularly <i>Palgrave's</i>, an overwhelming bestseller and coffee table staple from 1860–1920.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Worse, anthologies cheapened poetry by making poems easily available to readers who would never encounter them in the little magazines and literary reviews where they had originally appeared, much less a poet's published book. These people were, in other words, not real readers at all, whose posture before poetry was paradoxically both serious and disinterested, but cultural fakes, who consumed it lightly, like any other confection, in the course of other reading or daily activities. Finally, <i>Little Review</i>'s refusal to "compromise with the public taste" was a refusal to cater to these people whose very desire to read poetry unwittingly betrayed their unfitness for it. </p>

<p>This is the point at which Cullen's early status as boy wonder of the Harlem Renaissance starts to work against him both inside and outside the race. His dismissal by Riding and Graves as "the youngest and most sentimentally advertised of contemporary negro poets [who] writes just a little worse than the usual versifying white undergraduate" is a fair indication of how Cullen's promotion in New Negro circles was beginning to look to some outside Harlem and the mainstream press. This would include most specifically those such as Johnson and Locke who understood that the thrust of the insult lay not so much in the trivialization embedded in the patronizing "versifying," but in the image of an appreciative public that cannot distinguish aesthetic judgment 

<b></b>

 from sentimental advertisement. Rather than producing evidence of the race's "greatness," then, as Johnson predicted would happen, the Harlem Renaissance emphasis on black writing and publishing risked being seen as merely the ludicrous pretension of a people whose very hopes for the political efficacy of their poetry was the surest sign it would fail.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  </p>

<p>If anything, black poets in the 1920s suffered from wanting to have it both ways, to be both popularly accepted and avant-garde. As they were designed to do, treatises like <i>A Pamphlet Against Anthologies</i> cultivated an aesthetic hostile to mainstream readers and valued precisely for the fact that the kind of poetry promoted by people like Riding and Graves would rarely sell in the national magazines that actually paid for verse. The emphasis on the popular as an inverse measure of worth is key. Unfortunately for Cullen, the "large circle" that admired his work probably did so for the very qualities that came to mark it as "backward" in relation to the creation of a modern black aesthetic. Indeed, Redding's remark about the size of Cullen's readership discredits his poetry and him by associating both with this mass of presumably uncritical readers who not only had not read the little magazines, but probably would not understand them if they had and certainly would not like them. His assertion that Cullen's work is "interestingly distorted by too much of the vicarious" similarly recalls those gendered critiques that claimed popular culture, especially the movies, replaced authentic experience and emotions with the vicarious, ultimately empty pleasures of passive consumption.  </p>

<p>Of course, the digs at Cullen's "vicarious" relation to his subjects are intended also to imply what is racially inauthentic about his poetry: it comes out of a book rather than from anything an "actual" black man might "actually" do. That Cullen's manhood might itself be in question, rather than just his blackness, suggests the critical basis of this complaint may be both misogyny and homophobia. While homophobia may go a long way toward explaining the persistent denigration as mere exploitative patronage of Carl Van Vechten's considerable and enabling influence in the Harlem Renaissance, it would not explain why other reputedly homosexual male participants in the movement (Hughes, Locke, Thurman, Nugent, and McKay, among others) were not treated as Cullen was even though (or perhaps because) they were, if anything, more closeted.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Cullen never exempted himself from the category of the modern. Nor was he averse to elitist condescension. Though it is difficult to imagine two people less alike than he and Thurman, the "strangely brilliant black boy who had read everything" and "wanted to be a great writer, like Gorki or Thomas Mann," the two shared some ideas about poets and the black public.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Riding and Graves's contempt for general readers can be heard in Thurman's attack in "Negro Artists and the Negro" on "the mass of Negroes [who], like the mass of whites, seem unable to differentiate between sincere art and insincere art." Thurman is especially irritated that black readers are "unable to fathom the innate differences between a dialect farce committed by Octavus Roy Cohen to increase the gaiety of Babbitts, and a dialect interpretation done by a Negro writer to express some abstract something that burns within his people and sears him."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  This condescension can also be heard in Cullen's review of Hughes's <i>The Weary Blues,</i> where 

<b></b>

 his comparison of jazz poetry to "the frenzy and electric heat of a Methodist or Baptist revival meeting" depends on ring the participants as passive and unthinking. His language explicitly conceives of poetic production and consumption in elitist terms: "in the light of reflection, I wonder if jazz poems really belong to that dignified company, that select and austere circle of high literary expression which we call poetry."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Similar notions about the artist infect his feigned disdain for monetary compensation: noting in a letter to Idella Purnell that "<i>Palms</i> does not pay for contributions," he asks rhetorically, "but what poet is ever concerned about money?"<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Thurman, of course, was always concerned about money; he went into debt to produce <i>Fire!!</i> and supported himself and other literary ventures in part by writing hard-boiled tales for <i>True Story</i> under assorted pseudonyms.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  That he and Cullen actually disagreed profoundly about the proper character of the black writer, his or her work, and its readers is clear from the differences both in the tone of their critiques and, more tellingly, the focus of their condescension. Though he refers to "the mass of Negroes," Thurman's attack is directed not at the common people Cullen refers to, those who balance the "electric heat of a . . . revival meeting" with the pleasure of the juke joint or nightclub, but those bourgeois readers, the black Babbitts, for whom poetry is not meaningful at all, but merely the expression of "some abstract something" that doesn't even have to be named, much less adequately expressed, to trigger a rote response. More importantly, Thurman's redesignation of middle-class readers as the new black "mass" signals his understanding that modernism's villain was neither the masses per se, whose folk traditions were reimagined after Arnold as the basis of the authentic culture that had been lost through modernization, nor the canonical British literary tradition, which could at least claim, as Leavis maintained, an organic relation to the culture that had produced it, but the expanding culture of the middle-class itself in its definitive role as the new mass subject of contemporary commodity culture. In this liminal and transitional space between an authentic, if idealized, folk past and an avant-garde future lies the true cultural wasteland, a world cut off from any organic relation to the art it consumes, which, as a result, consists largely of popularized renditions of high-cultural staples and sanitized immigrant and ethnic expressive forms. Though they take shots at the left, Riding and Graves's scorn is reserved primarily for this middle-class readership and the various "household" uses to which it puts poetry, specifically as ready-made vehicles for expressing canned emotions and all the other "abstract somethings" Thurman mocks. </p>

<p>If after only a decade Cullen no longer enjoyed the high regard he did as Harlem's poet laureate, it is because he got ensnared in this dynamic and the contradictions it engendered for black poets. Caught between a modernist reaction against traditional poetic conventions and a bourgeois desire to win cultural legitimacy by demonstrating competence in them, Cullen eventually became "the symbol of a fast disappearing generation of Negro writers" Thurman predicted and his work dismissed as just the kind of "third-hand Keats" Pound lamented: effeminate and raceless because it is traditional and popular and vice versa. Meanwhile, though they claimed that their genteel forebears (and eventually even poets like Cullen) had sacrificed racial authenticity for 

<b></b>

 cultural legitimacy, some of those "younger Negro artists" like Thurman who consistently defended African American poetry in nonutilitarian terms and vehemently rejected any bourgeois mission for art ended up aligning themselves rhetorically with a new and largely white cultural elite determined to protect its own status and authority in large part by defining the poetic against the growing industry in mass produced literature. The final irony of this stance is that the Harlem Renaissance writers who found themselves on the side of those trying to rescue real literature from the masses and mass culture were the same people most likely to be associated in their work with both.  </p>

<p id="lead">In 1931, anthologist and critic James Weldon Johnson edited the second edition of <i>The Book of American Negro Poetry</i> to demonstrate that "there has grown a general recognition that the Negro is a contributor to American life not only of material but of artistic, cultural, and spiritual values; that in the making and shaping of American civilization he is an active force, a giver as well as a receiver, a creator as well as a creature."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Here, Weldon Johnson alludes to a commonplace of the period for all writers—culturally representative objects assert cultural power. There are, of course, contested meanings in the interpretations of objects that represent the authenticity of a culture, or that represent contested cultural identities. I place my reading of Helene Johnson's poem "Bottled" within the context of the discipline of anthropology and the idea of culture, both of which were undergoing radical changes in the early decades of the twentieth century. Anthropologist Franz Boas, his student Zora Neale Hurston, and others were theorizing and writing about the concept of culture—what later became known in anthropological circles as the "culture concept"—with the aim of disrupting and replacing the racist evolutionary comparativism's school of thinking with theories of cultural relativism.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Evolutionary comparativism held that cultures existed on a spectrum, from primitive to civilized, and that race was a key factor in determining which culture needed to evolve (these were assumed to be non-white and non-European) and which culture was already evolved (assumed to be white and European). Boas's assumptions 

<b></b>

 of cultural relativity held that all cultures were equally valuable and viable.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As a friend of and correspondent with Hurston, poet Helene Johnson would have been well aware of modernist theories of culture.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In "Bottled" , Johnson puts authentic and inauthentic into dialogue when she puts an imagined African jungle into a poem set on the real streets of New York City.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The speaker of the poem admires the (imagined) cultural adornments and proud dancing of a man in the streets of Harlem. The speaker reports that he dances to jazz, American music that has some of its roots in Africa but is not in and of itself wholly African; she also imagines this man as he would be if he were in Africa. He functions as a cultural object in the poem, a cultural object with contested authenticities. Johnson's use of a mixture of cultural tropes reveals her awareness of and attentiveness to theories of cultural relativism. Her poetry asserts an authenticity for objects of culture while it simultaneously calls that authenticity into question. The effect is to contribute to the concept of culture as a fluid, ever-shifting construct. </p>

<p>Without an authentic object, performance, or person to show the evidence of a culture, without objects of culture produced by the participants of that culture, how can that culture be taken as real, as authentic? The elision and erasure of black self-representation in literature and in other arts concerned Weldon Johnson and other black leaders. To that end, he chose to collect poems written by black poets into a representative anthology; he included Helene Johnson (1907–1995) in his second edition, introducing her poems by writing that she had "taken, so to speak, the racial bull by the horns," and, that she "bears the stamp of a genuine poet" (<i>ANP,</i> 279). I note this phrase—<i>genuine poet</i>—and I wonder what might make Johnson fake? Weldon Johnson does not define "genuine poet" beyond his assertions in his prefatory note to her poems that a "number of her best poems are done in colloquial style" and that "she realizes the hard fact that an effective poem in colloquial style demands as much work and workmanship as a well-wrought sonnet. Miss Johnson also possesses true lyric talent."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  There is here an assumption of a natural connection between authenticity, subjectivity, and originality. Too often, authenticity is associated with a poet only through one element of subjectivity— race or gender, say—elements that make up what John Paul Riquelme, during our Chicago seminar, called a "positive disruptive multiplicity."  </p>

<p>Another seminar colleague, Jane Kuenz, observes that our "biggest" and "first mistake when addressing issues of authenticity and black writers is to assume that 'authenticity' means something [. . .] qualitatively different from what it means for everyone else at the time." She notes that the idea of "the authentic" concerned black writers just as it concerned non-black writers; race was just one of many elements that contribute to a black writer's construction of the modern. Concerns about an authentic American art were not new in the modernist era. In "Democratic Vistas"  Walt Whitman wrote that "America has yet morally and artistically originated nothing. She seems singularly unaware that the models of persons, books, manners, etc., appropriate for former conditions and for European lands, are but exiles and exotics here."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Whitman and others saw American literature as simply European literature, transplanted 

<b></b>
into
  new soil but retaining its old form. Decades later, Whitman's concern had not entirely disappeared. In 1921, Weldon Johnson asserts that black America originated American artistic expression. Weldon Johnson contends in the preface to his first edition of <i>The Book of American Negro Poetry</i> that "the Negro [. . .] has [. . .] proven the possession of [artistic] powers by being the creator of the only things artistic that have yet sprung from American soil and been universally acknowledged as distinctive American products."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Black leaders assumed that self-representation by and through a "genuine poet," as Weldon Johnson called Helene Johnson, was important both to the project of claiming a distinct black culture and to the project of entering into the wider American culture while disrupting the normative force of that culture. Weldon Johnson therefore argued that black writers grew out of American soil; they were not the transplanted "exiles" Whitman worried about.  </p>

<p>I do not know if Helene Johnson is a "genuine poet"—nor do I know if such a person exists in any absolute sense—but I do know that Johnson wrote poetry that puts the authentic and the fake together, bumping any reader who expects to find only one authenticity of expression off-center. Readers seeking a steady, absolute authentic expression of race in Johnson's poetry will instead find themselves moving in and around oscillating, spiraling images, images that are always a little bit true, images that are always a little bit fake—images like the focal point of "Bottled," a dancing man treated as a cultural object. Her poem's speaker addresses a listener who is given no voice in the poem; neither do we hear what the object of the speaker's attention—the dancing man—has to say. This elision undermines the extent to which the speaker's words should be trusted; we have here an unreliable narrator, one whose observations and assertions should not be taken entirely at face value, but should not be entirely discounted, either. </p>

<p>The speaker begins by placing herself in Harlem, itself placed in a contested relation to Africa: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Upstairs, on the third floor<br />
Of the 135th Street library<br />
In Harlem, I saw a little<br />
Bottle of sand, brown sand,<br />
Just like the kids make pies<br />
Out of down at the beach.<br />
But the label said: "This<br />
Sand was taken from the Sahara desert."<br />
Imagine that! The Sahara desert!<br />
Some bozo's been all the way to Africa to get some sand.</p>

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">For this speaker, Africa is simply a collected museum piece in the library; only a "bozo" would be interested in going so far to collect something that merely resembles quotidian sand played with by ordinary kids. Though it is difficult to say what the speaker's gender, age, or race are, she is probably black because of the references to 

<b></b>

 living in the neighborhood: she was in the 135th Street library, and the day before, "on Seventh Avenue," she saw the dancing man.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  I suggest that <i>not</i> giving the speaker an explicit gender usefully blurs the lines of gender and allows for the possibility of female public power, as the speaker sees, observes, and participates in a public act of cultural awareness. Giving the speaker a specific racial identity allows for the poem to be more than a public assertion of cultural credibility; it allows a black speaker to be part of the process of constructing the concept of culture that in turn allows for multiple, performative possibilities in what John Paul Riquelme refers to as "processes of refusal" that transform the self, but not in any absolute way.  </p>

<p>Initially, the speaker joins the crowd on the city streets in Harlem in offensively making fun of a "darky dressed fit to kill" in "yellow gloves and swallow-tail coat" (ibid.). The speaker joins in the crowd's derision towards this "fake" man dressed in the trappings of bourgeois dress; joins them, that is, until the man begins to dance and the speaker begins really to look at his face, emphasized by the seven times the verb "see" is used in the poem (in various tenses). The offensive slang words (shine, darky) used by the speaker to refer to the black dancer could be racial self-hatred, but, significantly, it is at this moment that she begins to ascribe subjectivity to the dancer, even while "everyone / Was laughing at him." </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . Me too,<br />
At first, till I saw his face<br />
When he stopped to hear an<br />
Organ grinder grind out some jazz.<br />
Boy! You should a seen that darky's face!<br />
It just shone. Gee, he was happy!<br />
And he began to dance. No<br />
Charleston or Black Bottom for <i>him</i>.<br />
No sir. He danced just as dignified<br />
And slow. No, not slow either.<br />
Dignified and <i>proud!</i> You couldn't<br />
Call it slow, not with all the<br />
Steps he did. You would a died to see him.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




 

<p class="continued">The speaker's reportage shifts as she assumes the dancer rejects the "Charleston or Black Bottom"—dances that by this period had been made popular for white audiences (who usually danced them exuberantly) by black performers. The dancer in "Bottled" instead dances "Dignified and <i>proud!</i>"  </p>

<p>The speaker not only listens and reports the crowd's reaction to this "real" dancing by a man in "fake" clothes, but she also reports her correctives to the crowd's reactions, based upon what she believes she can see in the dancer's face: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>The crowd kept yellin' but he didn't hear,<br />
Just kept on dancin' and twirling that cane<br />
And yellin' out loud every once in a while.

<b></b><br />

I know the crowd thought he was coo-coo.<br />
But say, I was where I could see his face,<br />
And somehow, I could see him dancin' in a jungle,<br />
A real honest-to-cripe jungle, and he wouldn't leave on them<br />
Trick clothes—those yaller shoes and yaller gloves<br />
And swallow-tail coat. He wouldn't have on nothing.<br />
And he wouldn't be carrying no cane.<br />
He'd be carrying a spear with a sharp fine point<br />
Like the bayonets we had "over there":<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> <br />
And the end of it would be dipped in some kind of<br />
Hoo-doo poison. And he'd be dancin', black and naked<br />
and gleaming.<br />
And he'd have rings in his ears and on his nose,<br />
And bracelets and necklaces of elephants' teeth.<br />
Gee, I bet he'd be beautiful then, I bet.<br />
No one would laugh at him then, I bet.</p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Literally seeing and ratively imagining the real become conflated here. The speaker assumes that the dancing man does not belong there in the streets and that he is trapped by the clothing he wears; yet she also assumes that he transports himself to the African jungle and into suitably authentic adornments by listening to jazz, an urban music and black cultural form, and that he maintains dignity despite his surroundings, despite the crowd's laughter at his expense. Her admiration for this feat (which is really an act of her own imaginative projection) reveals an atavistic nostalgia for an Africa lost, and for an Africa imagined—in the form of a "real honest-to-cripe jungle." Roger Rothman's speculations about Dalí  's possibly deliberate use of "the fake" are to the point here; perhaps the tropes Johnson uses are deliberately fake, not naively engendered through a nostalgia for that which may not exist. And yet the possibility that a strong black warrior <i>could</i> exist and <i>could</i> be admired is also very much to the point. Maybe, we are meant to take this fake image as real—as the adjectival phrase "real honest-to-cripe" indicates. As conceived of in this period, cultural relativity allows for the possibility that the power—the spear, the magic, the fact that no one would laugh—and the beauty of the culture the speaker of this poem desires to see are all quite real, quite authentic. </p>

<p>Note, however, that the speaker is not really sure what would be found in Africa; the transported dancing man is imagined there, indicated by the use of the words "would" and the repeated phrase "I bet" after her description of imagined Africa ends. Africa as ordinary bottled sand becomes Africa as site of potential empowerment that ironically relies upon the speaker's power to bottle up the man, as well. No one, the speaker asserts, would laugh at this man if he were not in New York City; it is implied that he would be able to reach his full power from his "true" locale—a locale that is, of course, fictional, imagined, fake. This invites the question of whether his supposed power is fake, too.  
<b></b>

<p>The speaker concludes by coming to a "sudden" realization that the man on the street is like the sand in the bottle: </p>

<p class="continued">The speaker identifies the man with the actual soil, or sand, of Africa; he <i>is</i> that earth, metonymic of captured Africa, trapped within the "bottle" of America, with its history of slavery and its cultural trappings of middle-class desires—the suit, the coat, the cane. Her laughter at the man shifts to her musings about what he could be, and what he might <i>truly</i> be, "inside." Her recognition that he has been bottled up and put onto display causes the speaker both to pity him and to admire him because of his self-contained reality. The speaker's reaction of derision, then admiration, then pity for the bottled-up man reveals a complicated kind of cultural awareness, reading, and claim. She has, after all, collected and displayed her own version of this man. For her, this dancing man can only be admired as a man when she imagines him in Africa, or in an African setting; the implication is that he cannot be admired here on the city streets of New York. And yet, it seems clear that this is a typical flawed narrator: she laughs along with the crowd before she knows what she is seeing; she reports that the dancer does not know the crowd is there, but it is not clear how we would know this—the dancer is not given a voice to tell us this, directly. In the end, the speaker reveals her speculative awareness of the potential human drama unfolding in front of her, not only because of her act of really looking at his face and body, but also because of her imagination about where this man would need to be in order to be truly, authentically "proud." </p>

<p>The speaker's metaphorical collection of this man and her analysis of his authenticity recalls the World Exposition, such as the one held in Chicago in 1893. Expositions displayed living people as well as the objects they used and produced; the displays were usually designed to assert and to affirm then-prevalent anthropological theories of evolutionary comparativism that put European culture at the top and non-European cultures at the bottom of a hierarchical cultural scale.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  She seems to be making the very same bottling gesture. However, by placing the dancing man into an imagined but "honest-to-cripe jungle," one that could transform the man into an object of admiration and not just curiosity, the speaker asserts a theory of cultural relativism that was coming of age in the early decades of the twentieth century. But she also calls into question the very possibility of finding and displaying genuine objects—the man, the spear with its poison tip, the jazz, even the swallowtail coat—while she asserts the need for making that very move. I would argue that Johnson is not simply using the trope of the dancing man in a jungle cynically—creating a deliberate fake—nor is she overcome by the 

<b></b>

 racist trope, defaulting to a non-reflective admiration of the primitive. I think that we have to allow for the use of the objects as real, authentic, and genuine representatives of a culture, as well. They are, simultaneously, deliberately fake and deliberately real. What if, she seems to ask, <i>what if</i> we considered this naked man as <i>cultured,</i> not just an ethnographic "type"?<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>   </p>

<p>I am intrigued by the act of cultural collecting that takes place in some of Johnson's poems, poems in which "real" cultural objects are given power, only to have that power partially (but only partially) undermined by a realization of their inauthenticity. In "Bottled," we get the sense of a real lived experience (therefore an authentic experience), an idealized imagined experience (therefore an inauthentic experience), and a deliberate fake experience—(authentic? inauthentic?). Johnson's poem asserts a kind of authenticity grounded in the fake, grounded in that which cannot be proven nor found in the real, while it also asserts a kind of inauthenticity grounded in the "real."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  This interrogation of authenticity takes place in the poetry as Johnson collects and displays cultural objects, or ideas of culture, in her poetry to create a new poetics. Perhaps she could be seen as a part of what Roger Rothman calls a "counter-modernism [. . .] in which the confusion of the true and the false, the real and the fake, is understood not as a threat (or not merely as a threat), but as an opportunity." Johnson usefully does not mark out an absolute authenticity of race or culture in her poetry. She fails to endorse what racial or cultural authenticity would be, though her poetry often takes the lived experiences of black people as its origin point. Writing both within and against the European tradition, both replicating and resisting the European tradition of poetry in English, Johnson claims multiple meanings of the culture concept and demonstrates a cultural off-centeredness, which is, as ethnographer James Clifford puts it, "a state of being in culture while looking at culture, a form of personal and collective self-fashioning."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Johnson is neither exclusively participant in culture nor observer of culture; rather, she opens up her poetics to include a full range of "authentic" experiences that both assert and refute the idea of authenticity.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>. (<i>ANP,</i> 277). Though Weldon Johnson found Helene Johnson's work to be authentic, when we move from the reception in the Harlem Renaissance period to the present we find that current reception of her poetry varies: SallyAnn H.

Andrews, et al., eds. <i>The Oxford Companion to African American Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), 404. Nina Miller, however, rightly sees Johnson as a vital revisionist of the lyric female voice; Johnson's poetic authenticity rests upon its avant-garde nature which Miller locates in her assumption that all of the speakers of the poems (save one, in "Bottled") are female and thus the poems contain <i>public</i> black female voices in urban settings. <i>Making Love Modern: The Intimate Public Worlds of New York's Literary Women</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 209–41. The editors of <i>Double-Take</i>, a recent anthology of Harlem Renaissance writings and art, write that "because much of [Johnson's] poetry is both innovative and thematically relevant beyond her time, she is one of the movement's most important poets despite her short time in the public eye."

<p><a name="FOOT9" href="#REF9">9</a>. Though I default here to a feminine pronoun, there is no clear indication of the speaker's gender, as is true for many of Johnson's poems. I am attentive here to the speaker's identity in part because Nina Miller claims that this poem "is the only one of Johnson's poems to utilize an explicitly male voice, but one imagines that its success stems not from the gender of the speaker per se, but from the exuberant sense of urban mastery his gender affords him." Miller, <i>Making Love Modern,</i> 234. Miller bases her reading on the speaker's reference to a kind of gun that "we" had "over there" in World War I, and she asserts that this makes the speaker male because only males went to battle at this time. But it is not at all unusual for men and women alike to use the collective pronoun "we" when referring to what soldiers do, or for that matter, what governments do in state action. Though her assertion helps Miller make her overall argument about structures of power in a public place, with which I agree, it requires reading a specific gender into a poem that I contend does not reveal its speaker's gender.  </p>

<p id="lead">While in most studies of modernism and "race" the focus has been on the significance of African and African American arts, language, and music to Euro-American writers, in New York City modernist poets also turned in their ongoing constructions of the modern to affiliation with the huge population of immigrant Jews living on the Lower East Side, a population perceived at the turn of the twentieth century as racially alien in the U.S. Ill at ease with dominant American culture, poets saw themselves as similarly "alien," and as similarly attempting to establish new kinds of communities, foreign both to their (generally middle-class) upbringing and to contemporary consumerist culture. Some critics of modernity condemned exactly this quality of foreignness in their work. As Michael North reports, literature and art departing from traditional forms was branded with epithets of disease and miscegenation or "mongrelism": "The United States is invaded by aliens, thousands of whom constitute so many acute perils to the health of the body politic. Modernism is of precisely the same heterogeneous alien origin and is imperiling the republic of art in the same way," art critic Royal Cortissoz writes.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Some poets shared their sense of doom: from London, T. S. Eliot described New York as "invaded by foreign races"; poet and fiction writer Ben Hecht puns on "lice" and "life" to identify a dense population of immigrant Jews on Chicago's Halsted Street with disease; and Dada poet Baroness Else von Freytag-Loringhoven writes a diatribe against William Carlos Williams, associating him with "Jews" as "unsettled since aye," "parasites upon soil foreign," 

<b></b>

  "forever pariah of races," "only lost soul in void—jew—American possesses—with mere selfish desires . . . mismated happily to <i>peculiar distinct jewish tactlessness</i> . . ."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  For the most part, however, poets living in Greenwich Village (as the Baroness did but Eliot and Hecht did not) saw the immigrant Jewish population thronging the adjoining neighborhoods as representing an admirable cosmopolitanism, social and intellectual progressivism, and general willingness to experiment with the "new." </p>

<p>This essay explores modernist response to the Jewish diaspora both through a focus on New York's Lower East Side and through the little magazine of poetry that had the closest ties to the city and that embraced a local poetics in ways distinct from some of the strains of international modernism—namely, <i>Others</i>, edited by Alfred Kreymborg from 1915 through 1919. While Kreymborg and his coeditors did not set out to embrace a particular social agenda, it is hardly coincidental that the contributors to <i>Others</i> celebrate a linguistic and cultural mixing echoing the popular idiom of America as melting pot and affiliated with the re of the immigrant. Deliberately in the poetry of contributors Lola Ridge, Mina Loy, and Marianne Moore, and ironically through the parody of the Spectra poets' intended hoax, <i>Others</i> represents the hybrid position of the immigrant and Jew as vitally associated with that of the new poet. </p>

<p>As has been amply and accurately demonstrated, Euromodernism was profoundly anti-Semitic, and anti-Semitism appears in much of the writing of New York poets as well.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Adam McKible has even persuasively linked the <i>Little Review</i>'s at times open anti-Semitism to its move from Chicago to New York in 1916—where it remained until its demise in 1929.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Several features, however, distinguish the <i>Little Review</i>'s aesthetics and politics from those of <i>Others</i> and explain their differing responses to the local milieu of the Lower East Side. The<i> Little Review</i> prided itself on its internationalism, understood as placelessness or "exile"; as McKible argues, its community of writers "became consciously modernist by disassociating themselves from their local sites of literary production, which had the consequence of transforming them into a wandering 'tribe' of self-hating 'Jews'"—"Jews" in quotation marks insofar as the trope of eternal exile was based on the stereotyped re of the Jew (<i>SPM,</i> 79, 81). References to Jews in the <i>Little Review</i> were typically unplaced, presenting "the Jew as a tropological re" or "a point of intellectual identification, physical repulsion, and potential self-loathing," not as a neighbor living just down the street (<i>SPM,</i> 80, 89). Because the editorial policy of the <i>Little Review</i> repeatedly associated its qualities of "exile and transience" with aesthetics, devaluing the local in order to elevate individual genius, it necessarily disdained ideas of community based on the happenstance of contiguity (<i>SPM,</i> 81, 86). </p>

<p>In contrast, the poets associated with <i>Others</i> maintained a strong affiliation with the local and particularly with New York, which they identified with the mixed populations of the Village and Lower East Side. These poets tended to represent "the Jew" more positively than in European modernist work, or in the <i>Little Review.</i> Key, here, is both the aesthetic of <i>Others</i> and the nature of Jewish immigration to the U.S.: unlike Jewish immigrants to Paris, Zurich, Berlin, and other European cities, who were often transient in their living patterns, and unlike many Italian immigrants, who crossed the 

<b></b>

 Atlantic to work but sent their money home and intended to return to Italy, Central and Eastern European Jews came to the U.S. with the intention to settle. This transformative moment in American demographics coincided with the moment of aesthetic transformation in modern literature in ways appealing to the imagination of some New York poets—and perhaps especially to female poets, who experienced an excitement about the professional opportunities offered by the century and the city similar to that of many immigrants. For them, "the Jew" of common experience was not a wanderer but a neighbor, both absorbing and transforming the experience of living in America. Suzanne Churchill describes <i>Others</i> as "a house for the most innovative free verse" and as most representative of everything that opponents of the new literature found dangerous or offensive.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  <i>Others</i> and the poets most strongly associated with it indeed best reveal the inclusiveness of a performative restaging of modernist identity and poetry with reference to New York's immigrants and Jews. </p>

<p>Among poets identifying themselves positively with New York as the site of their creative production, reference to Jews was often related to immigrant community and was generally parallel in tone to other references to immigrants. Such reference sometimes placed Jews incidentally as a part of the fabric of ordinary life and sometimes occurred with an anthropological or exotic attention to Jewish otherness. At other times, poets used Jewishness to articulate what was distinctive in American modernity or even distinctively "American." Paradoxically, then, Jewish immigrants to New York provided these poets with both a useful re for alienation from American and European consumerism and a model for a characteristically American spirit of optimistic energy—a role quite different from that of stimulus for modern instability or disease and cultural decline. All poets of this period published in several little magazines, taking their predispositions with them. My point is not that any poet writes exclusively for <i>Others</i> but that the group most fully identified with <i>Others</i> also felt a strong and positive local affiliation with New York.  </p>

<p>Various circumstances gave rise to associations between modernist poetry and Jewish immigration in New York, for these poets. First, there was considerable intermingling of Gentile and Jewish writers, artists, and radicals living in the Village and on the Lower East Side during the 1910s and 1920s. Second, Jews in New York directly influenced the publication of modernist literature through their predominant ownership of presses willing to publish innovative poetry and fiction. In 1902, 1915, and 1917 respectively, B. W. Huebsch, Alfred Knopf, and Boni &amp; Liveright founded presses primarily devoted to publishing contemporary and avant-garde literature; within the next decade Harold K. Guinzburg and George Oppenheimer founded Viking Press, and Bennett Cerf invited Donald Klopfer to join him in founding Random House. Together, these shops were the primary publishers of experimentalist books in English in the early twentieth century.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Third, a large number of Jews were involved in the arts and (English-language) literature in New York during the early stages of modernist innovation, although because most of these writers are now regarded as minor, the significance of their numbers has become invisible to study of the period.  </p>

<p>Understanding early twentieth-century poets' attitudes toward the local also requires the realization that the little magazines publishing modernist verse in the U.S. perceived 

<b></b>

 themselves as experimental organs for the collective development and staging of modern ideas and forms, not as venues for proven excellence. As Churchill argues, little magazines were "performance spaces" bringing together like-minded readers and writers, reading "each issue in the same limited time period" in a mode allowing for the emergence of "a collective discourse about the meaning, look, and structure of the modernist poem, as well as the distinctive features of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and the American temper."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  More than the<i> Little Review, Poetry, Glebe,</i> or other little magazines, <i>Others</i> was the quintessential forum for such communal experimentation, because it published almost exclusively poetry and primarily work written by poets living in the U.S.—most often in New York.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  William Carlos Williams, a primary contributor to <i>Others,</i> speaks aptly for <i>Others</i> poets in his repeated insistence on the importance of location to verse: "the local is the only universal," he writes, and "No great literature has come from an insignificant place but has been stamped always with the local power that generated it"—adding "By place I mean a place like New York."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Many <i>Others</i>' poets contributed to modernism the distinctive "local power" generated by life on the Lower East Side. In contrast, many of the <i>Little Review</i>'s contributors lived outside the U.S., and the focus of its affiliation with foreignness resided in ancient cultures, European metropolises, expatriation or, as previously indicated, the concept of exile, not in immigrant populations. In June 1918, this was a matter of comment: under the anonymous authorial designation "X.Y.Z. New York," Jane Heap printed the complaint that the <i>Little Review</i> had "missed" an "opportunity" by "laying too much stress on the foreign trademark," specifically "the English or rather, British, crowd"; Heap comments only that "This is a very typical letter" (<i>LR,</i> 54). Whereas <i>Others</i> poets tended to gather personally as well as through publication—at Grantwood, New Jersey or Lola Ridge's parties—contributors to the <i>Little Review</i> were scattered across two continents.  </p>

<p>Literary critics have given little attention to the Progressive Era attitudes and demographic factors underlying American poetic modernism, although they are well established by historians.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Between 1880 and 1920, approximately 28 million immigrants entered the U.S., the vast majority settling initially in New York City.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The largest group came from the Russian empire (mostly Jewish) and the second largest from Italy (mostly Catholic), both groups typically settling first in the cheap tenements of the Lower East Side.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In 1910, 31 percent of the population of New York City was Jewish, and Yiddish was the dominant language spoken in a 20-square block area, from the Bowery to the East River and from Market Street to 14th Street, the areas now known as the East Village and Lower East Side; a 1920 <i>Automobile Blue Book</i> map labels this area "The Ghetto" (<a href="#1"> 1</a>).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>

<p>In 1920, out of a total population of five and one-half million inhabitants in New York City, over two million were immigrants—not including internal migration.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  These numbers are particularly striking when one considers that, at its height, the Jewish population of Berlin was never more than six percent and of Vienna and Prague never more than eleven percent.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  </p>

<p>While many writers of this period describe New York's "ghetto," some <i>Others</i> poets link it directly with modernist verse. Lola Ridge identifies her aesthetic as stemming

 from the experience of living in this "ghetto," and Mina Loy theorizes all modernist poetry as arising out of the intermingling of foreign languages on the Lower East Side: there "the tongue" of "the muse of modern literature . . . had been loosened in the melting pot."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  "You may think it impossible," she writes, "to conjure up the relationship of expression between the high browest modern poets and an adolescent Slav who has speculated in a wholesale job-lot of mandarins and is trying to sell them in a retail market on First Avenue. But it lies simply in this: both have had to become adapted to a country where the mind has to put on its verbal clothes at terrific speed . . . the ear that has listened to the greatest number of sounds will have the most to choose from when it comes to self-expression" (<i>LLB,</i> 159). Loy herself was among the "high browest" modern poets who "had to become adapted" to the flexibilities and speed of language in New York, just like the "Slav" on First Avenue, who in 1925 was almost certainly a Jew. The urban mixing of races and cultures was to her mind a generative source for creative innovation. William Carlos Williams, whose mother was from Puerto Rico 

<b></b>

 and father from England, more personally claimed that, because of his own "mixed ancestry" (as he called it in a letter to Horace Gregory), "America was the only home I could ever possibly call my own"; his distinctively American diction came, he said, "from the mouths of Polish mothers."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  As for Loy and Ridge, for Williams an American modernist idiom develops directly out of repeated contact with and attentive openness to the immigrant populations changing the face of "America." In this sense, von Freytag-Loringhoven was accurate in associating Williams with immigrant "Jews" in her Dada rant. Like Ridge, Loy, and Williams, a Yiddish-language poet (who did not publish in <i>Others</i>) saw attitudes toward Jewish immigration and racial intermingling as directly affecting the course of American poetry: Polish-born Jacob Glatstein distinguishes between the non-prejudicial "Americanness" of poetry written by poets who stayed in New York and the verse of "the snobbish anti-American rebels [who] fled from the Jews and the Negroes in order to be obsequious to Europe."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  As Glatstein suggests, at least some New York poets constructed "Americanness" as compatible with, if not arising specifically from, the city's heterogeneous population of immigrants. </p>

<p>The three poets living in New York whose work most fully affirms this heterogeneity with particular attention to its Jewish components are Ridge, Loy, and Moore, all strongly associated with <i>Others</i> magazine and all themselves "immigrants" to New York in their adult years—Moore internally from neighboring Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Loy from England (after teenage and adult years spent in Germany, France, and Italy), and Ridge from Ireland (by way of New Zealand, where she grew up).<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Three other poets—none of whom lived in New York—represented modernist verse through pseudonomynous identities as the product of a contemporary Jewish woman and her compeers as part of their "Spectra" hoax. Exploring the work of these six poets in relation to the milieu of the Lower East Side and the progressive discourse on race and Jewishness of the 1910s reveals the extent to which <i>Others,</i> and <i>Others</i> poets, tended to affirm Jewish immigrant presence in America. </p>

<p>Lola Ridge was born into a Catholic family in Dublin, grew up in New Zealand, and then fled an unhappy marriage, first to Australia, then to San Francisco, and then to New York in 1908, where she quickly became active in overlapping anarchist, feminist, and literary circles. She founded and edited the first two issues of the Ferrer School's <i>Modern School</i> magazine in 1912; she was associate editor of <i>Others,</i> and U.S. editor of <i>Broom.</i> Kreymborg credits Ridge with keeping <i>Others</i> going when his own interest temporarily flagged in 1918: she hosted parties for the magazine's contributors and supporters, solicited financial contributions, and organized the <i>Others</i> Lecture Bureau.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Like that of many immigrants, her first address in New York was on the Lower East Side, where she lived in a boarding house on Hester Street, the center of the traditional Russian Jewish open market and the site most often named as typifying the Lower East Side.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Ridge's first book of poetry  represents this experience in the long lyric sequence "The Ghetto," the poem that also gives its title to the volume.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Ridge begins "The Ghetto" with compassionate attention to the daily life of the "hot tide of flesh" crowding lower Manhattan, and its vibrant fluidity. Small details relate the story of 

<b></b>

 Jewish generational change: Sadie "wears her own hair" rather than the wig required of Hasidic women; young girls on their way to "forums and meeting halls" leave their heads "uncovered to the stars"—not wearing the traditional scarf to cover their hair. Sadie's mother bemoans her children's Gentile lovers. Sadie attempts to organize other garment workers ("'Slow down— / You'll have him cutting us again!'"), attends protest meetings, public dances, and "reads those books that have most unset thought" (<i>G,</i> 6–7), all activities enabled by life in New York and impossible to a girl in the orthodox environment of an Eastern European village. Although the photograph in <a href="#2">re 2</a> was taken in 1903, the scene it depicts would have been identical to Ridge's experience of the street in 1908, and of this area's extraordinary population density (<a href="#2"> 2</a>).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Ridge depicts unflinchingly the misery of life in such crowded conditions for an impoverished populace—the winter's icy cold and summer's "beast" of heat "pressing its great steaming belly close" to the "dissolute array" of the streets (<i>G,</i> 3, 12). In a later poem of the volume called "Flotsam," she refers to the city's population as "Flotsam of the five oceans / Here on this raft of the world" (<i>G,</i> 34). Yet these people, and in particular "This litter of the East," repeatedly "Takes on a garbled majesty" as she moves from overviews of the ghetto's crowded poverty to individuals. The scholar is indifferent both to the policeman who occasionally prods him and to the "raw young seed of Israel / Who have no backward vision in their eyes" and "mock him as he sways"; "All gutters are as one / To that old race that has been thrust / From off the curbstones of the world . . . / and he smiles with the pale irony / Of one who holds / The wisdom of the Talmud" (<i>G,</i> 14, <i>sic</i>.). Ridge's double association of the "old race" of Jews with both "backward vision" and the "wisdom" of deep learning was typical of this period for representation of first generation immigrant adults, but she sees younger and less orthodox Jews as a model of progressive thought and energy (ibid.). A few pages later we meet "the Committee / Sweet-breathed and smooth of skin . . . With shining unpouched eyes / And the blood, high-powered, / Leaping in flexible arteries— / The insolent, young, enthusiastic, undiscriminating Committee," that "Comes trampling with sacrilegious feet" (<i>G,</i> 18). It is perhaps some member of this group that teaches the parrot to shriek "<i>Vorwärts</i>"—a word betokening progressive politics and the name of a daily Yiddish-language political and cultural paper with an international circulation, founded by Abraham Cahan in 1897 and suggesting the cosmopolitan world-ties of many of these ghetto dwellers. As <a href="#2">re 2</a> depicts, here there were women with traditional head coverings and bare heads, men with traditional beards and clean-shaven, signs in Hebrew alphabet and in English. </p>

<p>Like the parrot, the people of Ridge's poem characteristically talk (and read): "words, words, words," Ridge chants. As quoted above, the "majesty" of this polylingual population is "garbled" but effectively, powerfully so. In a poem later in the volume called "Babel," Ridge declares that "God did cunningly, there at Babel"; by "dividing" tongues, he divided "soul from soul / So that never again should men be able / To fashion one infinite, towering whole" (<i>G,</i> 74). Read in isolation, the tone of this praise might sound ironic. In the ghetto, however, Ridge hears the babble of "world voices" as producing "Majestic discordances / Greater than harmonies," suggesting that mixed immigrant

 voices are more beautiful than a monolingual and suggestively patriarchal "towering whole" . In its polyglot discordances, the "ghetto" encourages "free camaraderie"; it houses "Egos yearning with the world-old want in their eyes— / Hurt hot eyes that do not sleep enough . . . / Striving with infinite effort / Frustrate yet ever pursuing / The great white Liberty." In another passage, "Stunted flame" and "the waste light of stars" fall into a room that is "Bare as a manger," suggesting that this room (like that earlier starlit barn of Christian scripture) may cradle world-shaking births. "Life turns," Ridge asserts. And there is, precisely, "Life" in "the cramped ova" of the Lower East Side; "Life, like a drunken player, / Strikes out" of young girls' "clear white bodies / As out

 of ivory keys"—again suggesting the aesthetic potential manifest in the contradictory demands and desires of immigrant grappling with the alien conditions of modernity and with change (<i>G,</i> 21, 22).  </p>

<p>The poem ends with this emphasis: while Hester Street is like a "forlorn" and tired woman, who has given birth to too many children, those births have "LIFE!" (<i>G,</i> 24). The poem's last nine stanzas exclaim the rich variety of this life in italics, concluding:  </p>

<p class="continued">While some passages of this poem express sympathy and others anthropological observation, here Ridge expresses unalloyed admiration, and her metaphors reflect a melting pot solidarity through their idioms: the "great vat" of the city, with its "strong flux" and "Passion eternal," produces "astounding" and undifferentiated—that is, no longer ethnically or culturally marked—"Life." </p>

<p>Throughout <i>The Ghetto and Other Poems</i>, Ridge describes New York with gritty realism. In a poem called "Faces," the Bowery "throb[s] like a fistula" while "Livid faces / Glimmer in furtive doorways, / Or spill out of the black pockets of alleys, / Smears of faces like muddied beads, / Making a ghastly rosary"—an analogy drawn from Ridge's Catholicism and revising the cleaner, fresher faces like "petals on a wet, black bough" of Pound's 1913 "In a Station of the Metro."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Even in their misery, however, the poor are sacred, their faces precious to Ridge in the metaphoric form of rosary beads. It is poverty and cold that makes their faces "livid" and smeared, not race or ethnicity. Later in the poem, the wind "rummage[es] / Like an old Jew" and "Not even a blasphemy" can be heard on Mott Street. In other poems of the sequence, she depicts more culturally affirmative scenes. In "The Fiddler," the poet observes a "little Hungarian café" where men and women drink "yellow wine in tall goblets" and a blonde fiddler "Leans to his violin / As to the breast of a woman" as his body "kindle[s] . . . Trembles and dives" to his playing (<i>G,</i> 75). Ridge's epigraph to the volume grandly addresses "THE AMERICAN PEOPLE," inviting them to "feast with" her, offering "bitter apples / And honey served on thorns" but concluding with the exclamation "How should such fare entice you!" (<i>G,</i> n.p.). Her staging of "LIFE" on New York's Lower East Side, in short, not only represents the making of new Americans but "should" tempt and nourish all 

<b></b>

 "AMERICAN PEOPLE." The "great vat" of the city transforms all its inhabitants, regardless of "race," place of origin, or length of time on American shores. </p>

<p>Alfred Kreymborg comments in <i>Our Singing Strength</i> that "The Ghetto" and Ridge's "other poems on the Jew are more authentic than kindred poems by Jewish poets. Ghetto folk are seen, not self-consciously, but objectively."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Whatever else it suggests, this comment indicates that Kreymborg read "kindred poems by Jewish poets." Her inability to speak Yiddish may indeed have allowed the also impoverished Ridge to see her neighbors' experience with some objectivity, and her Catholicism in the overwhelmingly Protestant U.S. may also have given her particular sensitivity to other non-Protestant religious cultures and expressions. At the same time, Ridge apparently sees in these "others" her own loneliness, displacement, and desire. Witnessing their determined passion to improve their lives may even have provided the necessary impetus for her to become a serious poet. In "Submerged," Ridge apparently writes of her own past, in saying: "I have known only my own shallows— / Safe, plumbed places"; she had wanted "a plank beneath" "the abyss" of the unknown to protect her from falling in "Submerged" (<i>G,</i> 85). But, she exclaims, "could I now dive / Into the unexplored depths of me— / Delve and bring up and give / All that is submerged, encased, unfolded, / That is yet the best." The Lower East Side of New York was far from being a "Safe, plumbed" place: living here among its "Majestic discordances" may have inspired Ridge to want to "delve" into her own unknown places. </p>

<p>As herself an immigrant offering the "feast" of her poems to the "AMERICAN PEOPLE," Ridge apparently hopes that the inhabitants of her described and constructed "Ghetto" will be taken in by her audience, those who—unlike her and her neighbors—were born "American." Similar optimism about integration and redefinition informed numerous other progressive conceptual metaphors for cultural transformation circulating during the first two decades of the century, and even more numerous memoirs, autobiographies, novels, and plays about the Lower East Side—both by individuals who spent their formative years there and by more established "Americans." While such writing was not for the most part linked with an avant-garde, it provides a significant cultural context for the poetry published in the U.S. during this period. The <i>Little Review,</i> for example, reviews Russian immigrant Mary Antin's <i>They Who Knock at Our Gates: A Complete Gospel of Immigration</i> in June 1914. Lithuanian immigrant and newspaper editor Abraham Cahan published <i>Yekl: A Tale of the New York Ghetto</i> in 1896; Polish immigrant Morris Rosenfeld published a bilingual Yiddish/English volume of poems, <i>Songs from the Ghetto</i>, in 1898; Protestant Hutchins Hapgood published <i>The Spirit of the Ghetto</i> in 1902 (illustrated by the son of Polish immigrants, Jacob Epstein)—suggesting that all comers can know this "spirit," not just immigrants or Jews. Israel Zangwill (the son of Russian Jews who had immigrated to London, where he was born) published his play <i>The Melting-Pot</i> in 1908, about a Jewish-Russian composer who titles his premier composition "American Symphony"; at the beginning of the play, the immigrant composer announces that "the real American has not yet arrived," but at the end he proclaims that America is "God's great crucible" where "the Great Alchemist melts and fuses . . . all nations and races."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Thinking along similar lines,  

<b></b>

 in 1915, German Jewish immigrant Horace Kallen proposed instead the metaphor of a cultural "orchestra," where immigrant groups retain distinct voices resonating with their heritage rather than assimilating into an amorphous unity. In 1916, Protestant Randolph Bourne followed a similar direction in advocating a "Trans-National America." In this "cosmopolitan federation," immigrants maintain their individual cultures but form alliances with those of others: already, he asserts, "the eager Anglo-Saxon . . . find[s] his true friends . . . among the acclimatized German or Austrian . . . Jew . . . Scandinavian or Italian. In them he finds the cosmopolitan note."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Such metaphors of cultural pluralism abounded during this period.  </p>

<p>Fiction and memoirs reflecting the ideals of such metaphors also abounded. Among those dealing with immigrant Jews in the U.S. or as "Americans" were an earlier book by Antin, <i>The Promised Land</i> ; <i>An American in the Making: The Life Story of an Immigrant</i>  by Rumanian immigrant Marcus Eli Ravage; <i>Out of the Shadow</i> , by Belarus immigrant Rose Cohen; <i>Rebels: Into Anarchy and Out Again</i>  by Ukrainian immigrant Marie Ganz; two collections of short stories and four novels, including <i>Salome of the Tenements</i>  and <i>Bread Givers</i>  by Russian immigrant Anzia Yezierska; and the story "The Day of Atonement" , which became the Broadway hit <i>The Jazz Singer</i>  and then a popular film , by Sampson Raphaelson.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Lithuanian immigrant Al Jolson (born Asa Yoelsen) starred in the film. As Protestant Danish immigrant Jacob Riis wrote in an essay called "The Jews of New York," "I am very sure that our city has to-day no better and more loyal citizen than the Jew."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  In a <i>Masses</i> review of Anna Strunsky Walling's 1915 <i>Violette of Pére Lachaise</i>, Max Eastman writes that Russian Jews "live and are sources of life."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  These and other writers of this era developed a portrayal of the modern American as plucky immigrant that resonated with the ideas of <i>Others</i> poets. "Berg, Borg, and Burg— / Berg, Borg, and Burg," writes Alfred Kreymborg in a poem published in the <i>Little Review</i>: "good Lord, who are they?— / Germans, Dutch, Swedes? / <i>Americans!</i>"<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Interactions among the populations of the Lower East Side and Village were not restricted to casual glimpses on the street or reading each others' publications. Social, political, and literary radicals gathered at the People's Institute of the Cooper Union, located on the border of the Village and Lower East Side, and literary, socialist and feminist groups intermingled in bookshops or garrets throughout lower Manhattan. First- and second-generation immigrants were simply part of the mix. Randolph Bourne was part of the <i>Seven Arts</i> little magazine group (1916–17) that included Ridge's second husband David Lawson, and many <i>Seven Arts</i> meetings were held in the Ridge/Lawson apartment—as were many of the parties Williams, Loy, Moore and other poets attended. Moore describes one such party as including Wallace Stevens, Alfred Kreymborg (a second-generation German immigrant), Marxist journalist John Reed, Italian immigrant poet Emanuel Carnevali, and Jewish political activist and novelist Waldo Frank—among others. A party at the Kreymborgs mingled Art Young and Max Eastman—socialists from <i>The Masses</i> staff—French immigrant sculptor Gaston Lachaise, editor Scofield Thayer, and "some Russians" with Moore, Ridge, and other poets.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Ridge published poems in (German Jewish) Emma Goldman's <i>Mother Earth</i> and Moore submitted 

<b></b>

 poetry to the Ferrer <i>Modern School</i> journal, after Ridge had ceased to edit it. Ridge describes Ferrer School meetings as made up of a "mob of 300—mostly foreigners and all wild unkempt spirits," and the School sponsored everything from Sunday School classes to poetry readings and political meetings.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The <i>Seven Arts</i> magazine in some ways exemplifies the ideals of this moment of social history in lower Manhattan. Not surprisingly, given an editorial board that included three progressive Jews among its four editors—Randolph Bourne, Waldo Frank, James Oppenheim, and Paul Rosenfeld—the magazine's motto was actively pluralist. "You must make of your culture a symphony," <i>Seven Arts</i> charged its readers, "that shall in a true way express your brotherhood of individuals, of races, of cultures blended together. You must make real the dream of an integrated and entire humanity."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In the same spirit of heterogeneity, <i>Seven Arts</i> chose photographer Alfred Stieglitz, the son of an immigrant German Jew, as the "incarnation" of modernism "in American terms and on American soil."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  In <i>America and Alfred Stieglitz</i>, Edna Bryner articulates this notion of Americanism: it is specifically Stieglitz's European Jewish background that stimulated his "urge for an Americanization beyond all ordinary conceit"; in his art one finds "the European, the pent-up American, the Jew yearning for deepest rootedness," leading Bryner to the remarkable conclusion that "nothing more native [to the U.S.] has ever been achieved."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  "American," here, designates conceptual properties, not ancestry. In this construction, the immigrant can produce art as natively American as that of anyone born on U.S. soil. </p>

<p>As an associate editor of <i>Others,</i> Ridge may have had some effect on its pluralist policies, but like <i>Seven Arts</i> this little magazine seems to have been conceived as heterogeneous from the start. Both its title and its motto foreground otherness, what goes beyond the known and tried: "The old expressions are with us always, and there are always others." Although this motto refers to the formal property of "expression" and not demographic heterogeneity, the writers contributing to <i>Others</i> apparently understood the new Americans to be as inevitably "with us" and as crucial to modernity as the new expressions. Perhaps it is not coincidental that most editors or associate editors of <i>Others</i> were themselves first- or second-generation immigrants—Kreymborg, Ridge, Williams, William Saphier, and Maxwell Bodenheim—and the latter two were Jewish.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Most references to Jews and immigrants in <i>Others</i> do not call attention to themselves as remarkable. Encounters with Jewishness, they imply, are a part of daily urban life, as are analogies to Jewish traditions or practices. Several Jewish poets publish in <i>Others,</i> but they are not alone in making such references nor do they consistently write on Jewish themes; the subject or metaphors of a poem, in other words, do not reveal the religious/ethnic identity of the author, and there are no openly anti-Semitic images, like Eliot's "jew squat[ting] on the window sill," the "owner" of a "decayed house," or Pound's multiple representations of what he at one point calls the "unbearable Jew" ("Upon the Harps of Judea") or general slurs on foreignness, like his use of the word "dago" in "To Bill Williams and Else von Johann Wolfgang Loringhoven y. Fulano"—both published in the <i>Little Review</i>.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Instead, periodic casual reference to immigrants thickens the associations of the city with the new and "other." In April 

<b></b>

 1916, Bodenheim refers to Williams' poem "The Wanderer" as "the impressions of a sort of intangible Wandering Jew"; in a poem called "The Cafeteria" he describes three women, one "a heavily-smiling, flitting-eyed Polish girl." In the May-June 1916 issue, Belgian Jewish immigrant Adolf Wolff refers to an elephant swaying "from side to side / slowly / solemnly / like an old Jew / praying"—suggesting that the traditional Jew's behavior is more familiar than the elephant's; (Christian) Edgar Lee Masters describes a Polish immigrant laborer in "The Subway." In December of the same year, Kreymborg's poem "New York" begins and ends with the same stanza: "There is a difference / wider than a city block / between the House of Moses / on Second Avenue / and the Chapel of the Immaculate Virgin / on Third"—both addresses in the Lower East Side. These institutions are linked by the fact that "honest humans crawl to both," but the repetition emphasizes coexisting cultural "difference" as that which characterizes "New York" .  </p>

<p>The Spectric School parody of modernism created by three white Midwestern poets also ironically identifies experimentalist verse with the fluid identity formation feared by many and celebrated by others as typified in Jewish immigration and assimilation. A January 1917 special issue of <i>Others</i> was devoted to this "School"—which, a few years later was revealed to be an elaborate hoax. Beginning in 1916, Witter Bynner and Arthur Davison Ficke parodied avant-garde verse under the names Emanuel Morgan and Anne Knish; for the 1917 <i>Others</i> issue, they were joined by Marjorie Allen Seiffert, writing under the pseudonym Elijah Hay. The identity concocted for "Knish" was explicitly cosmopolitan and implicitly Jewish. According to an essay published by Bynner in 1916, Knish was born in Hungary, educated at a German university, had published a volume of poems in Russia, and had lived until recently "on the Continent."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  This is a familiar pattern of Jewish education and immigration, and the name "Anne" suggests a common Anglicization of "Hannah." The name Knish also plays on the pastry associated with Eastern European, and Jewish, cuisine.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  In the poets' joint <i>Others</i> statement "On the Present State of Poetry," Knish/Ficke writes "All our emprises / Are toward a far Jerusalem,—and returning / Through the round of the world, / Find in the heart and loins of ancient home / The Sepulchre" [sic]. By making Jerusalem both "home" and tomb, Ficke parodies the <i>new</i> American verse as Jewish, hence ancient (or dead). One might say that Ficke (the son of a German immigrant) passes as "modern" by passing as Hungarian, Jewish, and female, perhaps to parade the foreignness touted by <i>Others</i> as "American." Emanuel Morgan/Witter Bynner adopts as parodic biography an equally familiar pattern: he recreates himself as an American painter long resident in Paris and only spurred to write through reading Remy de Gourmont. The quintessential "modern" American poet, these biographies mockingly imply, is associated with the old world of Europe either through immigration or expatriation. On the other hand, both biographies assume that modern verse is born out of generative contact with difference. </p>

<p>Knish's "ancient home" Jerusalem echoes countless popular references to the "ancient" faith of Judaism. For example, William Saphier's poem "Conscience" depicts an "ancient, despised Hebrew priest" as conscience itself, that unpleasant but necessary

 to remembering one's humanity: the priest "inflicted his heart-scorching sermon" on the speaker and thereby sparked "a whisper of duty in my heart, / commanding, beseeching, / that I offer on his altar. / And a strong white-hot wind blew / my brothers' woes into my veins."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  As previously cited, in "The Ghetto," Ridge also refers to Jews as "that old race." Given the pervasiveness of this connection, Elijah Hay/Marjorie Seiffert may also allude to Judaism in "To A." This poem's speaker stands at a "cross-roads," facing "the ancient swampy way / Modernized by a feeble plank or two" and imagines himself sinking into it, "a symbol of the creed / I perished shedding." If the speaker is a poet, this metaphor suggests that there is at most a veneer of the "modern" to the new verse, and that the "ancient swampy way" in which the "feeble plank or two" of modernity may sink could be Jewish culture or religion, especially given the later reference to the swamp as a "creed."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  If the speaker of "To A." has "shed" this ancient creed, then he may be a converted Jew—another sign of modern instability. In "To A.," Seiffert writes as a man (Elijah Hay) idolizing a woman ("Madam, you intrigue me!" the poem begins and ends), and many of Hay's poems address women. Like Ficke, then, Seiffert passes under a pseudonym and as the opposite gender—in this case also a patriarch, Elijah. Like many immigrants, she has rejected an "ancient swampy way," and this "shed" identity has enabled her/his American and poetic (re)birth. </p>

<p>Whereas Ridge saw the willingness to rethink traditional forms and cosmopolitanism as virtues in the modern man or woman, the Spectric school suggests through its parody that such slippage is simply one more way in which modernist poets (and poems) mark themselves as unstable, hybrid. Paradoxically, however, these middle-class Midwestern poets find that the taking on of fluid and foreign identities frees them to write a kind of poetry they would otherwise not have attempted. As Churchill argues, these performative identities donned in a spirit of mockery changed these poets' sense of them-"selves" as well as their sense of what constituted serious modern poetry. Whereas both Bynner and Ficke wrote cutting reviews of avant-garde poetry before their hoax, after the Spectric School was exposed Bynner comments that "I find now that I write like [Morgan] without the slightest effort—I don't know where he leaves off and I begin." Similarly, Marjorie Seiffert claims to "write more often as a man than as a woman," and Ficke eventually turned to the serious (not parodic) writing of free verse. Churchill speculates that for these writers, "something authentic has been released through the deception . . . some essential part of the self resides in the costume."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Although Churchill's focus is on the production of sexual identity in the Spectric Hoax her argument about the effects of performative fictive personae is relevant as well to the production of national/racial affiliation in modernist poetry. Posing as affiliated with Europe, (converted) Jewish, and multilingual placed these poets squarely in the circumstances Williams, Ridge, and Loy associated with the birth of the new American idiom and of modern poetry itself—namely that of adapting to change through the personal experience of radical cultural difference. </p>

<p>The Spectric number of <i>Others</i> came out in the same year as the special issue dedicated to Mina Loy's "Love Songs"—the only issue of <i>Others</i> devoted to a single poet's work. Given her strong connection to <i>Others</i>, Loy must have known both the Spectric 

<b></b>

 issue and Ridge's 1918 <i>The Ghetto and Other Poems.</i> Like Moore, she attended parties in Ridge's apartment, especially during her second stay in New York in 1920–21, when she lived in the Village. Loy published more significantly in <i>Others</i> than in any other venue. Churchill even describes her as "for a time, virtually synonymous with <i>Others,</i>" and indeed Loy's "Love Songs" appearing in its first issue was taken by many to exemplify the worst or the best of "the newest of the new."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Loy apparently wrote no new poems between early 1917 and 1919, during her first stay in New York and her year in Mexico. Around 1920, the focus of her work shifted from gender and heterosexual relationship to aesthetics and the development of a theory of creative mongrelism. It could be that Ridge's "The Ghetto," together with Loy's own experience of New York's Lower East Side, helped point Loy in this new direction.  </p>

<p>As I argue in "Feminist Location and Mina Loy's 'Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose,'" unlike Ridge, Loy would have experienced a shock of at least partial familiarity on the Lower East Side because her father was an immigrant Jew from Hungary (to London). Loy also spoke German, which would have given her access to some Yiddish vocabulary. Previous to her 1920–21 residence in the Village, however, Loy had little apparent interest in her Jewish ancestry or in an art that merged ideas of creativity with religious and cultural mixed inheritance—a mixture she called "mongrel" in obvious play on the racist discourse of the times in her poem "Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose." This poem's metaphors and fiction were significant in Loy's changing self-performance and in her conceptualization of ways she already wrote and lived. For example, she identified herself intellectually and creatively as Jewish, but practiced Christian Science. Similarly, one of the many names she assigns herself in autobiographical fiction is "Goy Israels"—a non-Jewish inheritor of "Israel," especially if the name is heard as a German genitive, which would translate as Israel's Goy. As mentioned earlier, in 1925, the year she published the final section of "Anglo-Mongrels," Loy also published "American Poetry," the essay where she describes the birth of modern poetry from the mixed inflections of English spoken and heard on New York's Lower East Side: "latterly a thousand languages have been born" there, she writes, and each one is an "English enriched and variegated with the grammatical structure and voice-inflection of many races." "On the baser avenues of Manhattan, every voice swings to the triple rhythm of its race, its citizenship, and its personality," where "the muse of modern literature arose" (<i>LLB</i>, 158–9). Experimental verse is the result of this linguistic variegation, an idea reflecting Ridge's "Majestic discordances." As with Ridge, living in the Village apparently "loosened" Loy's "tongue" to explore her own personal and cultural heterogeneity, leaving "plumbed places" behind.  </p>

<p>In "Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose," Loy writes that her heroine, Ova, makes "moon-flowers  out of muck"; creativity arises explicitly out of regarding that which is un-elite, common, dirty (in the poem, the child fantasizes from the partially heard word "diarrhea" to imagine great beauty). Through contrast with a character named Esau (representing Loy's British ex-husband Stephan Haweis), Loy becomes an implied Jacob. She thereby positions her heroine as a trickster who will replace the staid conceptions of privileged artists with a new tradition of "mongrel," feminist art. Because, like Jacob, 

<b></b>

 she is not heir to privilege or the role of leadership, the innovative poet must shape her traditions out of whatever she finds at hand. Ova is a "mongrel girl"; the creative individual, like the creative process, is impure, mixed—not in a state of self-loathing but in acceptance of the flawed conditions of humanity. Sampson Raphaelson makes the same basic claim in less positive terms in "The Day of Atonement," in referring to the "richly filthy East Side <i>argot</i>" from which his young protagonist gets his start.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The "muck" of mongrelism, "garbled majesty" (the "ancient swampy way" parodied by Bynner, Ficke, and Seiffert) is precisely the point of celebration and liberation for Ridge and Loy. </p>

<p>Moore knew Loy fleetingly and Ridge well. During Ridge's repeated illnesses in the 1920s, Moore frequently volunteered to type manuscripts for her, and she did type the manuscript of <i>Firehead</i> in 1929. She and Ridge were both of Irish heritage and both were outspoken feminists.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Moreover, like Loy and Ridge, Moore had close associations with <i>Others</i>; while she published only one minor poem in the <i>Little Review</i>, she published fifteen in <i>Others</i>—more than in any other little magazine. The December 1916 issue even announced a planned pamphlet devoted to Moore's poems, analogous to the single-author volume of Loy's "Love-Songs."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  As Robin Schulze states, one can hardly overestimate the role of <i>Others</i> in establishing Moore's reputation (<i>BMM,</i> 468). Although Loy and Moore performed their affiliations in dramatically different ways, their common tie to <i>Others</i> indicates their shared social-political principles with regard to ethnicity and race. Loy asserts the significance of her Jewish intellectual heritage and mongrelism primarily in prose and in a single (monumental) poem; Moore, in contrast, writes repeatedly about the necessity to judge people on the basis of abilities and the importance of a historical perspective on cultural preeminence. None of her poems celebrate mongrelism or mention immigrants or contemporary Jews, but many take on the poison of prejudicial thinking through metonymic example—presenting an individual or a moment as exemplum for a principle of perspective and judgment.  </p>

<p>As I argue in "Marianne Moore and a Poetry of Hebrew (Protestant) Prophecy," especially during the mid-teens, when she was attempting to work out for herself the role of an ethical speaker in a modern, secular world, Moore made repeated reference to ancient Hebrew poet-prophets as models to emulate. In the poem most often published under the title "The Past is the Present" (first published in <i>Others</i> 1915), for example, Moore turns to the poet-prophet Habukkuk as a model of willingness to challenge in verse what has been held sacred, in the service of spiritual understanding and ethical action: "I shall revert to you, / Habakkuk" the speaker proclaims, in striving toward a new verse in which "'Ecstasy affords / The occasion and expediency determines the form.'"<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Jonah, Isaiah, and Ezekiel are also recurrent res of admiration in early poems, and "Novices" and "England" both conclude with reference to what Moore calls "the spontaneous unforced passion of the Hebrew language—an abyss of verbs full of reverberations and tempestuous energy" ("Novices," <i>BMM,</i> 114). While these prophets re importantly in Christian scripture, Moore refers to them consistently as "Hebrew" or as "Jews," marking her debt to Jewish art and thought. Several of the poems Moore first published in little magazines also reverse stereotypes and popular misconception. "To Browning" scorns the sentimental language of flowers that denigrates

<b></b>

  yellow roses; Moore declares "If yellow betokens infidelity / I am an infidel," in alliance with the scorned, who as "infidel" are distinctly non-Christian (1915; <i>BMM,</i> 174). "To Bernard Shaw: A Prize Bird" presents the satirical British playwright as a "brazen" rooster who says what he thinks and is not "Blinded by the chaff / That every wind sends spinning from the Rick" (1915; <i>BMM,</i> 174). "Masks" celebrates the idiosyncratic "'loon' . . . . 'goose' . . . . and 'vulture'"—birds ridiculed by men with "empty lips," who apparently want all birds to be of a single (songbird) type. Moore instead calls these birds "kings of water and air," praising radical difference of function and type through ornithology (1916; <i>BMM,</i> 363). And "To Disraeli on Conservatism," published in the spring of 1915, celebrates the former British prime minister as a chameleon—one of the poet's favorite animals, frequently praised in her poems—and more directly as a "brilliant Jew," a designation she emphasizes by indexing the phrase in the apparatus to her 1924 volume <i>Observations</i>.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Just as Loy positions herself as Jacob, Moore speaks as a Jonah in two poems—"Sojourn in a Whale" (<i>Others</i> 1917) and "Is Your Town Nineveh?" .<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  In the latter, the speaker asks every reader to ponder whether he or she lives in a city like the one Jonah was supposed to warn of its wickedness and what the reader's consequent responsibilities would be. She then admits to having "stood" in her own New York, "looking / at the Statue of Liberty." For her, she implies, a full life requires both the confinements of duty, like Jonah's, and what she calls "personal upheaval in / the name of freedom." At the same time, by asking literally "Is Your Town Nineveh?"—an ancient city in present-day Iraq—Moore may be asking how the reader perceives the pressure of heritage on identity: do you, like Jonah, resent your displacement to foreign shores, a question logically addressed to literal as well as spiritual travelers. Like Jonah, like Disraeli, like foreign immigrants to New York, Moore indicates in multiple poems that she knows what it is like to be or feel out of place, caught between diverse ways of thinking and living. Moreover, she urges her readers to recognize their own mixed allegiances, debts, and affiliations. </p>

<p>While during the 1930s and later Moore writes several poems praising African Americans (mostly in her baseball poems) and with implicit focus on American racism, Moore most frequently represents the suffering of injustice or oppression through the re of the Jew. The long history of Jewish persecution would be sufficient reason for this association, as would the significance of Judaism to her own Christianity. Perhaps the link stems also, however, from the rising anti-Semitism she would inevitably have witnessed in the U.S., and her sense of the precariousness of the population of immigrants she lived among. In addition to poems praising Jewish prophets and the explicit reminder in "The Labours of Hercules" that it is indeed a Herculean task to "keep[] on knowing . . . that the Jew is not greedy, / that the Oriental is not immoral, / that the German is not a Hun,'" Moore writes of her personal debt to Jews in letters and essays (<i>BMM,</i> 265). In a 1944 review of Ada Jackson's poem <i>Behold the Jew</i>, Moore asserts: "all nations are of one blood"; Jews, she writes, are those "by way of whom all our moral advantages have come" (<i>CPR,</i> 403). In 1954, she writes her close friend Hildegarde Watson, "Much of my professional progress is through the magnanimity (and benevolence with money,) of Jews—the Guggenheims, the Times newspaper, Lincoln Kirstein, 

<b></b>

 Harry Levin, the Helen Haire Levinsons—I could go on and on."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  While wealthy and well-established individuals and families are hardly in the position of Lower East Side immigrants, Moore did not distinguish her immediate personal gratitude to individuals or institutions from her profound sense of historical and cultural debt, just as she regarded "all nations" as bound by the common humanness of "one blood."  </p>

<p>Moore had a predilection against what Loy calls "muck," commenting to Pound that "I accept mongrel art but a flavor of the exceptional must be there along with the negligible" (<i>BMM,</i> 454). On the other hand, in "To Statecraft Embalmed" she celebrates "Life's faulty excellence!" and in "Poetry" she insists on her own version of mongrelism and attention to the ordinary: there must be "real toads" in a poet's "imaginary garden" (<i>BMM,</i> 203, 205—both first published in <i>Others</i>). Similarly, in the poem "Dock-Rats" (first published in the <i>Others for 1919</i> anthology), her re for a fellow New Yorker is the rat. This choice refers to her own family nickname ("Rat") but may also act as a corrective to xenophobic discourse representing New York's ghetto-dwellers as analogous to the rodents literally teeming in the city's poorer neighborhoods.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  In "Dock Rats," Moore speaks in the first person as a rat to other poets or New Yorkers "who seem to feel that [New York] is a / good place to come home to" and who enjoy the diversity of its proffered experiences (<i>BMM,</i> 245). As anti-Semitism escalated in Europe and the language deriding Jews as vermin became more prevalent, she omitted this poem from her 1935 <i>Selected Poems</i> and never published it again, perhaps because she realized that her defense of the poet-mongrel as rat in 1919 would have unfortunate connotations in the mid-1930s. In 1919, however, her point was clear: like the chameleon, the toad, or the rat, the person who seems alien to her or his surroundings, who may be feared or despised, is in fact admirable for qualities of ingenuity, adaptability, and the ability to conceive of or make more than one home. Like Loy's poetry that swings to "triple rhythms" and Ridge's "Majestic discordances," Moore's res for intellectual and personal flexibility overthrow expected hierarchies to value the traditionally and currently marginalized.  </p>

<p>Positive affiliation between modernist poets and Jewish or other immigrants does not re obviously in the annals of American poetic modernism, but the Jews of New York did help make the modernist literary revolution possible through their own writing and through publishing and circulating the work of experimentalist writers, and they provided a focus for the theorizing of modernist verse and life far more complex than the frequently cited anti-Semitic attitudes of the time suggest. Jews and immigrants were not just an "other" modernist poets defined themselves against or a re for ambivalent affiliation and disdain, but a crucial part of <i>Others,</i> literally and metaphorically, in providing a re for self-identification as cultural outsider open to radical change. The poets associated with <i>Others</i> do not link Jewish belief or stereotypes with modern decline but represent New York's mingled immigrant populations as energizing, "American"—the "muse of modern literature," as Loy puts it. For Ridge, Loy, and Moore, in particular, the conception of the new, of belonging to a "modern" age that rejects the patterns of prohibitively conventional thought and form, is allied affirmatively to representations and tropes of mongrelism, immigration, and Jewishness.

Among those dealing with poetry, DuPlessis depicts "semiticized discourse" as characteristic of Anglo-American modernism, noting that "materials constructing the New Jew—especially assimilation and secularization, ethnic character, mixing and purity all consolidated in the mongrel trope—emerge forcefully in poetry" (<i>Genders, Races,</i> 141). In mapping the range of this discourse, however, DuPlessis does not differentiate attitudes in New York and London, and relies heavily on examples of British anti-Semitism.

<p>My goal is to bring out the negativity in a characteristic stance toward authenticity among writers of the long twentieth century. That stance typically involves three moments: first, an evocation of wrongheaded attitudes and behavior that present themselves as authentic (true, pure, natural, and the like); often the attitudes are refused (or refuted); if they are accepted, it turns out that they would better have been refused; second, an evocation of an alternative that appears to be itself authentic, or at least preferable; finally, a self-correcting stance that recognizes the alternative as itself not authentic in any absolute, static sense but in need of being part of a process that does not replicate the refused ostensible antitype. The self-correcting stance can include the antiessentializing recognition that Roland Barthes 

<b></b>

 presents as knowing our own mortality, our situation in a historical process that will displace us.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Or we can think of the three moments as representing what Homi Bhabha and Judith Butler might agree is a shift from the pedagogical to the performative, a shift that recognizes the possibility of the performative lapsing into the pedagogical and of the pedagogical persisting even in attempts to reject its specific forms. Modernist negativity displaces the pedagogical, at times through a self-correcting, self-transforming merger of the aesthetic and the political. In that merger, the embodied, historical, fallible dimension of human experience becomes a basis for making defensible choices about values and actions.  </p>

<p>I had planned to focus in my paper on Oscar Wilde's notion of lying as one crucial origin for the process by which modernist authenticity rejects (and corrects) conventional, institutionalized, essentializing attitudes without itself becoming totalizing. For reasons of space, efficiency, and (primarily) compulsion, my paper wrote itself mostly about Yeats and briefly about Bob Dylan, specifically "Fergus and the Druid"  and "The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest" . There is no intention, or possibility, of overlaying these texts absolutely, but each gives us a version of a process involving literarily a dialogical, actually polylogical, situation in which apparently opposing perspectives are taken up into a potentially self-correcting dynamic that is represented or otherwise evoked. In sum: in this model, the modernist critique of authenticity involves a negative moment of corrective rejection followed by a further different kind of negativity that recognizes the corrective rejection's inevitable eventual lapse into bad faith (or ideological delusion, or inauthenticity). Among the many omissions below: no sustained exploration of androgyny as a relevant gendered dialogical form or of the complicated refusal in literary modernity of the cultural denial of death and the related technological imperative to master nature. Androgyny's relevance to the scheme is evident in Virginia Woolf's comments on gender and identity in chapter six of <i>A Room of One's Own</i> . There her swerve from the constrictive masculine "I" of some male writers (and of Italian Fascism) is not a turn toward a singularly gendered female identity; instead of the latter, which Woolf warns against, she turns to androgyny, a mixed state presumably involving unpredictable interactions within a process of emergence, as in Fanon's third stage of postcolonial nation building mentioned below. </p>

<p>The inherent fluctuations, or oscillating perspectives, of modernist negativity that I argue for in Yeats, Dylan, and Wilde occur as well in modern painting. Primed by Roger Rothman's paper on Salvador Dalí, our discussion began bringing out the connections. A move away from positive knowledge occurs in avant-garde painting, as well as in the writing I discussed. Magritte and Duchamp deserve consideration, along with Dalí. Of particular relevance is Magritte's famous series of paintings that simulate pipes along with the hand-written sentence, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe."  </p>

<p>Evoking the difference between the material object and its apparent representation by means of the negative assertion, Magritte goes beyond the mere unmasking of visual illusion by introducing writing's mediations into the ostensible immediacy of visual perception. The unsettling effects emerge in a process that is cognate with the 

<b></b>

 unfolding of modernist authenticity in stages as I describe it below. The oscillations set up by the paintings can be understood with reference to Wilde's mention of the Cretan Liar in "The Decay of Lying," the paradoxical relations between voice and writing in modernist dialogues starting with Wilde, the simulacrum understood as a lie that stages a truth about experience, the aesthetics of the counterfeit (as developed by Hugh Kenner in <i>The Counterfeiters</i> [1968]), and the signed soup cans of Andy Warhol. In his monograph, <i>Ceci n'est pas une pipe</i> , Foucault links Magritte's paintings to Warhol's soup cans. Taking the argument in those directions extends to post-Dadaist art, and to key res of literary modernism, Walter Benjamin's claim in "Author as Producer" that "The revolutionary strength of Dadaism lay in testing art for its authenticity."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The testing for authenticity goes on before and after Dada and Surrealism, in Yeats's writing, in Dylan's, and elsewhere during the long twentieth century. The pseudonymous "Bob Dylan," that musically shape-changing re who turned himself into a pop star over the objections of his folk music fans, shares with Yeats's Fergus a resolute determination not to be a character in someone else's dream. As David Shumway rightly points out in his contribution, "Dylan has repeatedly refashioned himself, always giving the impression that the new Dylan is at least <i>an</i> authentic Dylan." Yeats's character and Dylan's persona are comparable, despite the fact that Dylan's work emerges at a later stage of commodity culture. Both writers face related risks of acceding to social pressures. Both project the dangers, along with possible responses involving self-correcting, self-transforming processes of refusal. 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>In "Fergus and the Druid," Fergus answers the Druid's question about what he wants by expressing his discomfort and desire. He wishes to: "Be no more a king / But learn the dreaming wisdom that is yours."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  His answer is based on a belief that he can avoid being "but a foolish labourer / Who wastes his blood to be another's dream" ("FD," ll.28–29). Finding the role prescribed for him as ruler constricting, Fergus has abdicated by running off to the woods, where he opens, against the advice of the Druid, the bag that releases an uncontrollable multiplicity into his experience. The result brings not happiness but something negative: "But now I have grown nothing, knowing all. / Ah! Druid, Druid, how great webs of sorrow / Lay hidden in the small slate-coloured thing!" ("FD," ll.38–40). Fergus has the final word in the poem, but it is not definitive, except in so far as it raises questions rather than confirming his own answer. That is, Fergus is not Yeats's spokesperson. He is not a persona to be identified with the poet either here or in the other well-known poem about him, "Who goes with Fergus?" Empson placed the latter poem in category six of his seven types of ambiguity, identifying it as a kind of literary hurricane. The style that Empson notes early in Yeats's career, also evident in the dialogue form that Yeats refines over decades, embodies literarily the self-correcting aspect of the modernist critique of authenticity, including its own. Because Fergus in the dialogue poem is only one participant (though his style changes in the final stanza), not <i>the</i> voice of the poem, what he says and how he speaks are in dialogue with other elements and styles (the pressures of his people; the views of the Druid; the composite style of the dialogue in which he appears). As in "Who goes with Fergus?", the result is a question, or a process of questioning, that can yield various answers and perspectives. </p>

<p>Yeats evokes the issue of authenticity for himself and his character, who become comparable, but not merged, in related processes involving refusal and the experience of a potentially vertiginous, uncontrollable multiplicity that cannot be ignored or suppressed. The following several elements, all involving negation, combine to connect poet to character: </p>

<p>1. The poem's situation focuses on a re refusing to read the lines of a script provided by social convention. Fergus can stand in this regard for an array of characters and personae (many linked to the artist in some way) during the long twentieth century who say "no": including Hardy's poetic persona in his last poem and elsewhere, Wilde's Salomé, Stephen Dedalus, the Irish rebels of "Easter 1916," Dr. Aziz in <i>A Passage to India</i>, Mrs. Ramsay in <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, Thomas Sutpen, his children, and Quentin Compson in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>, Toni Morrison's Sula, and some of Beckett's personae. These res cannot be reduced to a single shape, but they do have in common a noteworthy refusal that is one moment of modernist negativity responding to pressures to conform. </p>

<p>2. Yeats refuses in this work (and elsewhere) to rely on conventional mythic resources, including classical myth (which appears in some of his later works) and English national mythology. Fergus does not fit comfortably among either Homeric or Arthurian mythic res. Yeats says "no" to both traditions (and to English and European hegemony and expectations) by drawing instead on his own versions of Celtic myth. This political act 

<b></b>

 involves the poet's relation to <i>nation</i>, a relation that can be described with reference to Fanon's three stages of developing a postcolonial identity. For Fanon, nation building moves through stages of accepting and refusing foreign ways before reaching a "zone of occult instability" that enables something new to develop as an authentic nation.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Yeats contributed to bringing Irish mythology and an Irish nation to birth, not to recovering an authentic home that had once existed. He committed himself to helping write the history of the future for the Irish nation.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>   </p>

<p>3. Both stylistically and conceptually, Yeats refuses the lyric persona whose name in English is "I" by writing dialogical poetry that here happens to be literally a dialogue. The post-Romantic Irish writer is saying "no" to the English lyric tradition and to "I" as an adequate, that is, an authentic, name. </p>

<p>4. The poem evokes, beyond specific refusals and determinate acts of negative rejection or positive acceptance, a disruptive multiplicity, represented by the bag (reducible neither to Pandora's box nor to Aeolus's bag of winds, aspects of classical myth that leave hierarchies of power involving gender and social position in place). The effects of opening the bag can stand for the multiply framing, polyvocal tendencies of modernist literary discourse, whose ambivalences resist being reduced easily to a dominating, essentializing discourse. The multiplicity provides no single direction or set of directions for reaching home, lyric I, or the myths and styles that try to define the limits of meaning, value, and behavior.  </p>

<p>For shorthand, and as part of a refusal to forget Bob Dylan's refusal to be himself or to be anyone else's spokesperson, I group these and related aspects of Yeats's modernist negativity under the rubric "no direction home," from Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone" (used by Martin Scorsese as the title for his 2005 documentary). The phrase responds to pressures to conform, that is, to be authentic in prescribed ways with regard to social position, national myths, gender, selfhood, literary form, and even (particularly) logical coherence. Dylan's phrase suggests the condition of being homeless (a condition that can be more authentic and revealing than thinking you know what or where home is), and of being more, that is, less than homeless, a Beckettian lessness that is directionless about home through some indeterminate combination of refusal and incapacity.  </p>

<p>The pattern I discern in Yeats appears in varying truncated or otherwise modified forms in other writers and works, including Dylan's "Ballad": away from a socially defined role, home, self, and discourse toward a negating alternative that cannot become a place of rest (it's just a house, not a home, and definitely not Paradise, whatever we might want to think), lest it become itself in its turn a static, pre-scripted, limiting shape. The disruptive multiplicity creates continuing uncertainties and instabilities that keep the experience of role, home, self, and discourse sufficiently out of the territory of positive knowledge and unalloyed acceptance to turn all those elements into the names of questions. In Dylan's song, the dynamic, performative questioning of authenticity involves the interplay of negative language and reversals of language. These give rise to a fluctuating response that is unlikely to accept the "moral" formulated in the song's closing. The song's language expresses undulations and reversals particularly vividly in the exchange between Frankie Lee and Judas Priest about "house" and "home": <b></b></p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>"What kind of house is this," he said,<br />
"Where I have come to roam?"<br />
"It's not a house," said Judas Priest,<br />
"It's not a house . . . it's a home."</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




 

<p class="continued">Coming (in order) "to roam" is an unexpected, unsettling locution, since it suggests ambiguously in context that Frankie Lee's roaming has come to an end at the house. The phrasing reverses the more direct and understandable <i>roaming to come</i> (home, or to the house). Instead of a destination, this house that isn't a house may represent the continuation of roaming (he's come there "to roam") or even the start of a new kind of wandering. Judas Priest's repeated negative assertion concerning house and home is taken further in the negative language of the song's closing "moral": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Well, the moral of the story,<br />
The moral of this song,<br />
Is simply that one should never be<br />
Where one does not belong.<br />
. . .<br />
And don't go mistaking Paradise<br />
For that home across the road.</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The emphatic negative repetition of "never," "not," "don't," and "mistaking" push hard in an apparently univocal way. But the putative distinction between "Paradise" and "home" repeats in a new vein the distinction between "house" and "home." As in the earlier passage, there is an unsettling reversal in the phrasing, which we could reasonably expect to be <i>mistaking that home across the road for Paradise</i>, rather than vice versa. The effect of didactically expressing the "moral" in negative terms and oddly reversed phrasing is arguably to generate resistance and uncertainty in the reader rather than acceptance. The heavy-handed character of the didactic moment produces an antipedagogical effect in our response, which is performative because of the negations and reversals. The song's language generates a dissonance within an assertion that, for Yeats's Fergus or anyone else who lacks a sense of belonging, makes the conceptual link in the rhyming of "home" with "roam" definitive. </p>

<p>Yeats's early poem has been central to this meditation, but the refusal of a stabilizing identity there and the impetus toward enabling future refusals that cannot be mapped in advance constitute together a nameless, unnamable direction and a directionless homing that are visible earlier and later in writers important for understanding literary modernity: ". . . no things but nameless things, no names but thingless names."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Dialogic literary form in the literal shape of dialogues has a significant origin in Wilde, whose twin concepts of lying and masking inform the literary modernity of writers in the long twentieth century. Wilde develops lying conceptually and aesthetically in "The Decay of Lying" as a memorable alternative to the distortions of self-proclaimed, self-congratulatory truth, realism, disinterested historical objectivity and accuracy, and morality; it makes the Cretan Liar, who may well turn out to be Irish, black, female, 

<b></b>

 or gay, an alternative to the Victorian sage. Lying embodies what Wilde calls in <i>Intentions</i> the truth of masks, the notion that "a Truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  With that Wildean compass, or its equivalent of their own modification or invention, Hardy, Yeats, Woolf, Ellison, Beckett, Heaney, Morrison, among others, and their readers are in less danger than they otherwise would be of thinking we've found Paradise, when the "home" across the road is really only a house. In this authentically modernist universe, all directions lead to roam.  </p>

I wish to thank Marie-Anne Verougstraete for her rendering of René Magritte's famous word picture, <i>La trahison des images</i>, which he produced and alluded to in numerous versions and variations in his paintings and drawings from the 1920s to the 1960s. Magritte's representation of the pipe that is not a pipe is the best-known visual meditation of the twentieth century on the enigmatic relations of art to truth and lying. As Magritte is reported to have remarked, ". . . if I had written on my picture 'This is a pipe,' I'd have been lying!" (reported by Claude Vial, "<i>Ceci n'est pas René Magritte</i>," <i>Femmes d'Aujourd'hui</i> (July 6, 1966): 22–24). As do Warhol's repeated images and signed objects, Magritte's multiple versions raise the issue of the counterfeit in modern aesthetic practice.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT6" href="#REF6">6</a>. During the seminar, the question arose concerning the extent to which Yeats believed in the authenticity of the Celtic myths that inform his writing. The pattern I have outlined provides a basis for responding. By choosing Fergus, Yeats finds an alternative for aspects of British culture that are inauthentic for the Irish. He discovered and collected Irish myths and folk narratives, rather than simply inventing them, but they emerge explicitly as res, rather than found, unchanging realities, in his later poetry. This is the case in the middle section of "The Circus Animals' Desertion," where "'The Countess Cathleen'" is "the name I gave" to "a counter-truth," and Cuchulain is part of a "dream," one of the "Players." Yeats moves past the adducing of "counter-truth" in, among other ways, the fusing of Irish myth and non-Western forms and perspectives in his memorable plays influenced by the Japanese Noh tradition. The rejection of a British embodiment is still evident, but the Irish res have been taken up into a surprising transformational process. David Shumway claims that "Yeats found" authenticity "in Celtic mythology." Although that may have been the case early in his career, Yeats's writings include prominently a fully modernist version of authenticity.  </p>

<p id="lead">Having been the only essay primarily devoted to the visual arts, my paper was something of an outlier. Nonetheless, the conversation came around a few times to Dalí's practice and more generally to the question of how to integrate historical accounts of the literary and the visual. The paper that follows does not attempt this difficult work, but it seems to me that a place to begin is with an evaluation of the determinative properties of canonization. In the seminar, I proposed that, despite the evident reality of multiple modernisms within the visual arts, there nevertheless unquestionably existed a hegemonic mainstream of modernist production that no historical revision can decenter without, in the end, fundamentally misrepresenting the events as they occurred. That this hegemonic mainstream exerted a centripetal force on the plurality of contemporaneous practices suggests that alternative modernisms are best understood as having developed dialogically—in direct or oblique relation to the mainstream. One wonders then whether or not the same is true of literary modernisms. To put the question another way: if it can be said that visual modernisms are "arboreal" (to use Deleuze's terminology), might it be the case that literary modernisms are by contrast "rhizomatic"? I don't have an answer to this, but framing the question in this manner may go some way toward clarifying what we mean when we speak of "multiple modernisms." And this, in turn, may help to shed light on the question of modernist authenticity, for the extent to which the question of authenticity can be said to preoccupy the mainstream of modernism is, I would argue, a question that must be answered at the outset. It was clear from a number of the papers that, within the diversity of experiences we call "modernity," experiences of <i>inauthenticity</i> 

<b></b>

 were both widespread and profound, and that diverse practices were developed to counter such experiences. Implicit, therefore, is the notion that modern life was shot through with things that seemed in one way or another inauthentic—deceptive, fake, superficial, ersatz. For me, the fact that this would be so remains a question in need of more precise answers. The essay that follows aims to be a step in that direction. </p>

<p>When André Breton first saw Salvador Dalí's paintings, he was by his own admission awestruck: "With the coming of Dalí, it is perhaps the first time that the mental windows have been opened really wide . . . "<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  With these words, written in 1929 to accompany Dalí's first exhibition in Paris, the founder, promoter, poet and principal theoretician of the Surrealist movement was throwing all his weight behind Dalí, in the hope that his paintings (and his charismatic presence) would breathe new life into Surrealism, which at this point—five years past its first stirrings—was beginning to show some age.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  There was one painting, however, about which Breton was less enthusiastic. <i>The Lugubrious Game</i>  depicts a strange and mesmerizing collection of objects, some painted with meticulous attention to detail, others cut from newsprint and affixed to the surface with equal meticulousness (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). What disturbed the poet was the male re in the foreground—more precisely, the stain that appeared on his pants, a brown stain that runs like melted chocolate past the man's shorts and onto his right leg. Breton was known by his friends to have had a profound and apparently unshakable distaste for anything even vaguely scatological, and this small but extravagant rendering was altogether too much for him to bear. As Dalí recalled some years later (after their friendship had soured), "I was obliged to justify myself by saying that it was merely a simulacrum. No further questions were asked."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  </p>

<p>What are we to make of this incident? For most, it's an event hardly worth mentioning—indicative only of Dalí's considerable skill at handling those around him whose critical support he understood as useful in advancing his career.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  But I wonder. Isn't it possible that Dalí in fact meant what he said? Isn't it possible that he believed that what he had painted was not a man with shit on his pants, but rather a man with a <i>simulacrum</i> of shit on his pants? Puzzling as that seems (it's a painting after all and thus a simulacrum in its entirety), there is, in fact, reason to take this notion seriously.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Dali's recollection of this encounter may well have been tainted with bad will toward Breton (Breton had, after all, taken to referring to the painter by the name "Avida Dollars"), but it is also true that while Dali was working on this painting, he was undeniably fascinated with the concept of the fake. His 1930 poem, <i>The Great Masturbator</i>, for example, makes reference to a host of fake things: "fake gold," "fake bronze," "fake bricks," and yes, "fake shit," too (in fact, the poem makes a point of distinguishing this fake shit from "real shit").<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Indeed, Dali's understanding of the unconscious was itself understood through the lens of the illusory and the fake. Memories, he contended, were like jewels in that "it is always the false ones that look . . . the most brilliant."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  

<b></b> 

 One would thus be justified in suggesting that Dalí's reply to Breton's outrage was, if strategic, nonetheless substantive. </p>

<p>One of the few lacunae in the vast scholarship on Dalí is the painter's fascination with fakes. Although this is not the place to undertake a full account of it, this fascination developed out of an interest in surfaces on the one hand and the illusionistic potential of painting on the other. A close examination of Dalí's writings shows that fakes, simulacra,  

<b></b>

 surfaces, illusions are just as much the subject of Dalí's paintings as are rotting animals, giant insects, and desolate landscapes. And yet these elements were invisible to Breton (who only wanted to be assured that Dalí was not in fact coprophilic) as well as others who saw (and still see) Dali's paintings only as illustrations of fantasies, dreams, perversions and unconscious obsessions. </p>

<p>This raises the question of why Dali's interest in illusions, copies, and fakes failed to register, even with those most intimately engaged with his work. And one might ask as well: is Dalí's interest in illusions, copies, and fakes indicative only of his personality (a mind capable of being thrown "open really wide"), or is it also, perhaps, indicative of modern experience in general? In other words, to what extent can it be said that Dalí's interest is tied to experiences in which one finds oneself interacting with (or worrying that one might interact with) things that are not real, but are instead illusory or otherwise inauthentic? The answer, I would suggest, involves his deliberate rejection of modernist techniques in favor of a reactionary return to the techniques of the Old Masters. </p>

<p>What was it about the paintings of the Old Masters that the moderns found most objectionable? On the surface, it was simply that they were old—out of date and incompatible with modern life. More substantially, it was that they were perceived as having focused only on the surface of things, the outer skin. They failed to register the inner reality of the world, the hidden truth. The problem, in other words, was that Old Master paintings were, in a certain fundamental sense, superficial. And the solution—according to a vast array of artists and critics—was to develop a pictorial practice that would reach below the surface of things, a practice that would therefore count as more profound. The evidence of this ambition is multiple, and beyond the scope of this essay. One example will have to suffice: "The true purpose of painting," wrote the critic Jacques Rivière in 1912, "is to represent objects as they really are; that is to say, differently from the way we see them. It tends always to give us their sensible <i>essence</i>, their presence; this is why the image it forms does not resemble their <i>appearance</i> . . . "<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The understanding of modernism as hostile to superficial appearances and thus aimed at unveiling an inner essence has been recently elaborated upon by the philosopher Alain Badiou, who argues that the guiding ambitions of twentieth-century art and culture are animated by what he calls "la passion du réel"—which is to say a deep-seated, irrational impulse to destroy any and all conventions in the name of direct, unmediated experience.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Badiou's assessment of twentieth-century culture has drawn considerable attention, but it actually continues a line of analysis that has been developing since the 1960s and 1970s—by people like Henri Peyre, Geoffrey Hartmann, and of course, Lionel Trilling, who argued in <i>Sincerity and Authenticity</i> that, from the early modern period, 

<b></b>

 the question of how to see beneath the surface of things so as to discern the genuine from the fake, the sincere from the phony, was among the most salient features of art and literature, and indeed of social life in general.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Trilling attributes the modern fixation on authenticity as bound to a pervasive fear of deception, which he explains (albeit cursorily) as having resulted from fundamental changes within the social sphere of modern life—above all, the decline of feudalism, and with it the rise of social and economic mobility in the modern city.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Writing at the turn of the century, Georg Simmel attributed the modern anxiety about deception to the peculiar conditions of urban experience. Simmel claimed that by virtue of its grand scale and its enormous population—too large to know intimately—the city was a place where interpersonal suspicion becomes, by necessity, a normal feature of everyday life.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Simmel also noted that the modern city alters not only one's relation to people but also one's relation to things. The spectacle of commodities on view in trade exhibitions and department stores fostered the intensification of what Simmel called "the shop-window quality of things"—that quality of a commodity that is distinct from both its use-value and exchange-value. The shop-window quality of an object (its display-value, as it were) is determined exclusively by its appearance. "Where competition no longer operates in matters of usefulness and intrinsic properties, the interest of the buyer has to be aroused by the external stimulus of the object, even the manner of its presentation."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  With emphasis shifted from "intrinsic properties" to "external stimulus," it is easy to understand how the threat of deception—as in interpersonal exchange—becomes an urban problematic.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  It's worth remembering that with the rise of the city comes the rise of the detective novel, in which the heroic re is no longer necessarily capable of great physical feats. Instead, his ability to compel our awe and fascination comes from his deductive ability, his ability to see through people and things to reveal what's hidden underneath.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Simmel's work suggests that in the modern city there was an imperative for everyone to become a kind of detective, constantly alert to the possibility that one was on the verge of being ripped off—and, furthermore, that modernism as Rivière and others articulated it was driven by a common anxiety that the world was shot through with deception.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The modernist rejection of the techniques of the Old Masters thus can be seen as a concerted, if not altogether desperate, attempt to ward off self-deception while at the same time producing a work of art that would manifest itself as having nothing to hide.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In a text that dates from 1900, the philosopher Henri Bergson makes a claim about human consciousness and the imperative of the modern artist that seems to me to encapsulate this dynamic:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Between nature and ourselves . . . a veil is interposed: a veil that is dense and opaque for the common herd,—thin, almost transparent, for the artist and the poet . . . So art, whether it be painting or sculpture, poetry or music, has no other object than to brush aside the utilitarian symbols, the conventional and socially accepted generalities, in short, everything that veils reality from us, in order to bring us face to face with reality itself.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> <b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">

 With this, Bergson offered up modern art as bound to the ambition to strip away the superficial "veil" of appearance so as to arrive at something that deserved to be called authentic experience—an experience that was to be understood as standing outside all social conventions and artificial systems of organizing knowledge. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
3.
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>What does this have to do with Dalí? What is the relationship between Dalí's antimodernist embrace of Old Master techniques on the one hand and Badiou's "passion of the real," or Bergson's "reality itself" on the other? The answer, I believe, lies in Dalí's fascination with superficiality, illusions and fakes. In 1927, Dalí wrote to his friend, the poet Federico Garcia Lorca: "I am superficial and the outside of things is what delights me, for in the last analysis the outside of things is that which is objective."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  In an essay published that same year, Dalí sounded a similar note, recalling Simmel's window-shopper: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Oh marvelous mechanical industrial world! . . . Magnificent invitations to the senses and to the voyage of discovery of unknown objects, the gray rubber of tires, the clear glass of windshields, the soft tones of enchanting filter-tipped cigarettes the color of lips, golf bag [sic], marmalades of all colors, pastries of delightful qualities . . . perfect products, the eurythmic play of curves; alterations of diverse qualities, <i>smooth surfaces, rough surfaces, polished surfaces, speckled surfaces</i> . . . "<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Unlike the detective, Dalí expresses no interest in determining whether or not he's being deceived. What interests him are the surfaces of things, not their insides. What he loves is not so much the things of modernity (their "intrinsic properties" as Simmel put it), but the way modern things look (their "external stimulus"). He has no concern at all about Bergson's veil; indeed, it seems that for him the world might just as well be one enormous veil. Here is the conclusion I draw from this: Dalí's rejection of modernist techniques in favor of a return to those of the Old Masters is an effort, at least in part, to replace depth with surface, authenticity with artifice. In the 1920s, while Dalí was vacillating between modernist and traditional techniques, his thoughts were scattered and inconsistent, and his intention is visible only in piecemeal fashion. But in 1930, he worked to formulate this concept cogently, in an essay entitled "The Sanitary Goat."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  This was published together with three others in a small book entitled <i>The Visible Woman</i>. Of these four texts, "The Sanitary Goat" has received the least scholarly attention, probably because it doesn't help much with the struggle to understand Dalí's imagery. But when it comes to making sense of <i>how</i> Dalí painted, it is, in my opinion, among his most important aesthetic statements. </p>

<p>The text begins with a critique of modern art at large, which, says Dali, is infected by what he calls a "lingering impressionism" ("SG," 226). He attributes this lingering impressionism directly to Bergson, whose error, claims Dalí, is to respond to the threat of deception by shrinking back, by turning inward toward the immediate data of the 

<b></b>

 senses. This, Dali claims, merely concedes the problem without solving it, for if the question is the reality of one's experience, then it solves nothing to focus only on the "impressions" that this reality makes. For Dalí, the only legitimate response to the threat of deception is to embrace illusion itself, to celebrate the superficial world of images, and in doing so, put an end to the Bergsonian ambition altogether. </p>

<p>For Dalí, it is toward the realm of the simulacrum—the illusory image—that painters ought to turn their attention.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  There is a point, he claims, where reality and its representation start to pull away from each other—a point where a picture no longer serves to represent the world, but rather makes its own world. In "The Sanitary Goat," he calls this the "gratuitous point," because it is at this point that an image becomes gratuitous—it no longer serves its original representational function and instead acts according to its own internal dynamic.  </p>

<p>Dalí's analysis here is far from straightforward, and is best understood by turning to his principal example: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[A] gratuitous point . . . might take shape in the gesture, generally taken to be erratic, of a person who, without knowing how to play the piano, imitates (perfectly) on a marble table the confident fingering of a true pianist, convinced of the absolute similarity of his imitation . . . This point . . . would materialize precisely at the moment when the fake pianist would lose for a moment his absolute faith in his imitation, but would continue with it nonetheless with no less enthusiasm.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
("SG," 229)
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">It should be emphasized that there is nothing "surrealist" about the imagery evoked here; there is nothing irrational or dreamlike about a person pretending to play the piano. What Dalí wants us to recognize is that the apparently banal act of pretending to play is itself potentially both strange and disorienting. </p>

<p>Dalí makes no direct connection in "The Sanitary Goat" between the concept of the "gratuitous point" and the paintings that he was at the time completing (paintings such as <i>The Lugubrious Game</i>), but it nonetheless suggests a way to approach them. It suggests, in other words, that we think about these paintings as "gratuitous points"—that is, as representations that have at some point detached themselves from the world of reality to which they had once been connected (or at least seemed to be connected to—remember that the fake pianist only believed himself to be mimicking the gestures of a real pianist). </p>

<p>Although Dalí's paintings are typically understood as having abandoned the traditional task of representing visible, outer reality for the sake of depicting the invisible, inner reality of the unconscious, this is not at all what Dalí himself indicates. If we are to interpret paintings like <i>The Lugubrious Game </i>according to the example he gives here, then they are not to be understood as faithful representations of the dream-world. In fact, they should be seen as altogether unfaithful representations—that is, as fakes. To see Dalí's work in this way requires a significant shift in perspective. It demands that we take seriously not only <i>what</i> Dalí painted, but also, and perhaps more importantly, <i>how</i> he painted. In other words, when Dalí flippantly deflected Breton's outrage by referring to his painting as "a mere simulacrum," he was, in a paradoxical way, telling him the truth.<b></b> </p>

In his seminar essay, Jared Stark associates Charles Baudelaire's and Walter Benjamin's conceptualizations of suicide as bound to a dialectic of authenticity and illusion—a dialectic which Stark likewise attributes to the discourse of modernist painting: "Compared to the painter's falsification of life, the suicide exposes the reality of art for what it is—the 'illusion of life.'" While it is unclear whether Stark is here referring to all painting, or only painting before Manet, he later suggests—in ways which chime with my account here—that modernist painting (after Manet) is aimed at countering the pervasive deceptiveness of modern life: "Against the overwhelming inauthenticity of modern life, the painter opposes an experience that makes the real visible." </p>

How are we to understand these practices in relation to the mainstream of modernism—a mainstream that, as Trilling, Badiou, and indeed this very seminar has made clear, aspired above all to the experience of authenticity?</p>

<p id="lead">In a letter that Bishop's biographer, Brett C. Millier, considers "may have been the most important single piece of criticism Elizabeth ever received," Marianne Moore posed the aesthetic problem of "depth" to her young protégé, Elizabeth Bishop.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Moore wrote: "I can't help wishing you would sometime in some way, risk some unprotected profundity of experience." <sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Responding to the 1930s pressure for artists to engage with the political left, Moore urged Bishop to turn, as the older poet herself had, to the "deeper" moral and metaphysical Christian critique of culture provided by the cultural critic and theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Although Bishop admired Niebuhr and read some of his books, she could not rely on Christian metaphysics to provide a ground for her work. Bishop's second volume of poems, <i>A Cold Spring,</i> published in 1955 but written almost entirely during the 1940s, constitutes Bishop's solution to the problem of depth. Paul Klee's experiments with the construction of deep space provided Bishop with a means of imagining a poetics of aesthetic and ontological depth. In drawing on the work of modernist painters in order to solve a literary problem, Bishop participates in what Charles Altieri has called the "dialectic between painterly achievements, writerly appropriations, and painterly responses" that was integral to the story of modernism.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As Altieri has shown, poets often used the work of modernist painters to invent models of subjectivity, positions for the "I" in relation to landscape or world.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Drawing on Klee's innovative use of a fluid deep space, Bishop located the eye/"I" deeply, extensively and expressively within the complex relations of a mobile environment of other motifs, bodies, and textures that carried multisensory and emotional experiences. 

<b></b>

 The eye/"I" almost without skin becomes witness to and host of the "events" of the environment in which it hangs.  </p>

<p>Bishop's lifelong engagement with the visual arts is well documented, although it has been examined only partially.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  A brief listing of the range of her interests would include her early attraction to Van Gogh, before Van Gogh's work was widely known in the U.S.; her report in a 1939 letter that she "almost lived" at MoMA;<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  her frequent comparison in letters and notebooks of people, animals, and places to particular paintings or painters; her long friendships and extensive correspondence with Margaret Miller, research associate and then associate curator at MoMA, the American painter Loren MacIver, and the English painter Kit Barker; her own amateur work in watercolors and her construction of two Joseph Cornell-like boxes; her frequent visits, sustained over a lifetime, to exhibitions and museums; her frequent purchase of art books and art; and her reading of art criticism in the small American and British magazines as well her extensive reading of major art historians: Irwin Panofsky, Alfred H. Barr, Ernst Gombrich, Meyer Schapiro, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Eugene Fromentin, and Arnold Hauser. Occasionally, we can even glimpse the intensity of Bishop's encounter with particular paintings. In 1949, at a moment of personal despair, Bishop begs MacIver to finish "that little picture with the lights" so that it can accompany the poet as life raft or talisman for her upcoming dreaded year in Washington D.C. where Bishop was to serve as Consultant in Poetry at the Library of Congress.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  During that year in Washington, Bishop felt a special attraction to the Phillips Collection, and years later, returning to the museum, two Daumiers so overwhelm her that she reports feeling her "entire life has been wasted."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In 1959, she claims that she can remember almost every Calder that she had seen in an exhibition of 1932.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The wide range of paintings and sculptures with which Bishop was familiar and to which she responded passionately in her correspondence and notebooks may overwhelm any scholar wishing to discover how she drew on visual art in creating her own aesthetic. Yet deeper affinities for particular works and artists emerge in the course of her career. Bishop most consistently names three painters as fundamental for her: Edouard Vuillard, Paul Klee, and Kurt Schwitters.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Bishop's debt to Klee is most demonstrable, and this essay focuses on her use of some elements of Klee's aesthetic, particularly in the 1940s drafts and in the poems included in her second book, <i>A Cold Spring.</i>  </p>

<p>Some of Klee's paintings moved her because of their ability to express the dismemberment caused by the invasion of a force from outside that enters the self and severs its integrity. In these paintings, subjectivity became catastrophically open to the surround that violently encroached across the membrane of skin or consciousness. But, Bishop also used Klee's experiments with deep space to protest that invasion and to redress it. Drawing on the aesthetics of Klee—as made available to an American audience through the 1945 MoMA publication edited by her friend, Margaret Miller—Bishop created poetic structures that allowed for relation to external forces to be held at a distance, where differences in scale and speed do not threaten the self but are ranged around it in a variety of shapes or orbits. Contemporary criticism on Klee described an alternative structure for engagement with forces outside the self, stressing the suspension of the 

<b></b>

 subject in relation to floating motifs and the variety of colors and textures that cross into but do not threaten the self. In this mode, openness allows for a genial capaciousness, gentle emotional warmth, and response to the surprise of encountering motifs and textures that emerge in the environment. Such poems as "Faustina, or Rock Roses," to be examined later, combine the two responses to Klee's work, holding subjectivity suspended among and viscerally open to textures and motifs in an environment that also carries a potential sense of threat.  </p>

I. Klee in Bishop's Correspondence
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Three moments in Bishop's letters suggest that Klee was of particular importance to Bishop and begin to characterize the nature of her interest in his work. In the famous October 17, 1940 letter in which Bishop managed to hold her own against Marianne Moore's suggested revisions to "Roosters," Bishop refers to the feeling that arose in her when she viewed Klee's painting, "The Man of Confusion," arguing that her own antiwar poem sought to recreate a similar feeling. In response to Moore's critique of the crudeness of triple rhymes, Bishop tells Moore: "I can't bring myself to sacrifice what (I think) is a very important 'violence' of tone—which I feel to be helped by what <i>you</i> must feel to be just a bad case of the <i>Threes.</i> It makes me feel like a wonderful Klee picture I saw at his show the other day, 'The Man of Confusion.'"(<i>OA,</i> 96). "The Man of Confusion" displays the severed sections of a disintegrated human body, literally fallen apart and scattered over the surface of the canvas (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). The "man" is ambiguously also a woman bearing the separated pearls of a necklace, without string, arrayed under the detached head. The features of the woman's face have also begun to "fall out" of the face: the mouth has migrated over towards the edge of the face and one of the eyes has begun to widen and become detached, yet the other eye maintains its normal position, giving the uncanny effect of a person trying to hold on to normalcy and ignore the loss of her own body. The normal eye creates a consciousness inside the picture that watches as a distanced observer while its own body is subjected to violence. Bishop's invocation of Klee's painting to explain her use of triplets reveals her intention to replicate this "severing" through the triple rhymes that harshly break up the sentences and return with crude overinsistence to the same sound, drawing undue attention to and therefore detaching each item so that it stands isolated at the end of the line. Each end rhyme is spit out (the cock's cry "grates like a wet match / from the broccoli patch, / flares and all over town begins to catch").<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The brevity of Bishop's remark makes it difficult to know whether she was referring not only to the rhymes but also to the content of the poem, which contains two startling dismemberments. However, the remark does suggest that Bishop thought of the "severed" nature of the rhymes and their crude violence as expressive of the position of the speaker who is torn apart by the rooster's calls. The roosters who "planned to command and terrorize the rest" enforce "deep from raw throats / a senseless order" by "active / displacement in perspective; each screaming; / 'This is where I live!'" and thus tearing apart the just-wakened sleeper by pulling her attention harshly and forcefully in many different 

<b></b>

 directions (<i>CP,</i> 36). This violence to the "I" becomes the psychological equivalent to the second dismemberment, which occurs in the "falling apart" of the roosters/soldiers' bodies as, in their dying fall, feathers and then eyes "detach" from the bodies. Holding on to this "tone of 'violence'," produced by rhymes, diction, and subject matter, and legitimized by the Klee painting that so moved her, Bishop refuses to alter the poem in accord with Moore's suggested revisions. Within the next month Bishop twice invites Moore to see the Klee exhibit (at the Buchholz Gallery October 9–November 2, 1940), suggesting not only that she wishes to make amends for her rebellion but also that it would be of particular importance for the younger poet to see Klee's paintings with her mentor at her side. </p>

<p>The second significant reference to Klee in Bishop's letters occurs when Robert Lowell sent Bishop the poems that would eventually become part of <i>Life Studies</i>. Bishop 

<b></b>

 responded enthusiastically to Lowell's new style. In her reply of January 29, 1958, she evokes Klee to get across the aesthetic that she is praising in Lowell's work:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I bought that Webern you had before I left and I'm listening to parts every day. I think I'm so smart, because when you played me one piece I immediately thought it seemed like the musical equivalent of Klee—now, according to the notes, Webern was actually a member of the Blue Rider group . . . I still can't take very much of the songs—for one thing, those voices aren't too good, even if accurate—but I am crazy about some of the short instrumental pieces—they seem exactly like what I'd always wanted, vaguely, to hear and never had, and really "contemporary." That strange kind of modesty that I think one feels in almost everything contemporary one really likes—Kafka, say, or Marianne, or even Eliot, and Klee and Kokoschka and Schwitters . . . Modesty, care, <i>space,</i> a sort of helplessness but determination at the same time. Well, maybe I'm hearing too much.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Again, Klee's name appears at a moment when Bishop struggles to get at a description of her aesthetic. If Lowell's new poems and the Webern instrumental pieces allow her to replace an inchoate vision ("what I'd always wanted, vaguely, to hear . . .") with the thing itself, Klee's name still hovers, close to the unnamable, indescribable ideal.  </p>

<p>Writing to Lowell three years later, Bishop again struggles to articulate a possible way forward for poetry. Looking for an alternative to the Beats, she can only vaguely point Lowell (and herself) to a not-yet-discovered mode of writing, one that she senses is possible because she has seen it in Klee:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>What you say about Marianne is fine: 'terrible, private, and strange revolutionary poetry. There isn't the motive to do that now.' But I wonder—isn't there? Isn't there even more—only it's terribly hard to find the exact and right and surprising enough, or un-surprising enough, point at which to revolt now? The beats have just fallen back on an old corpse-strewn or monument-strewn battle-field—the real protest I suspect is something quite different—.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
(If only I could find it. Klee's picture called FEAR seems close to it, I think)<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">As in the letter to Moore and the previously quoted letter to Lowell, Klee represents for Bishop an achieved mode, an aesthetic model, even though a poetic corollary remains difficult to invent. Bishop invokes Klee to explain, clarify and more fully imagine the mode of writing that she herself finds desirable but not yet attainable. Bishop had seen this painting more than ten years before writing the letter, in another Klee exhibit at the Buchholz gallery (May 2–27, 1950) [<a href="#2"> 2</a>]. The painting was also reproduced in the eulogy that Andre Masson had written for Klee.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Composed by using oil on burlap, "Fear" shows a "person" completely submerged in the fabric of the irregularly spherical shape of its own "body." Only the eye is visible, and even the eye is composed of the same burlap texture as the body in which the eye is embedded. The body itself is barely distinguishable from the surrounding environment, also composed of burlap in ochre and blue tinted browns. The effect is an even more extreme version of Klee's earlier "Arab Song" in which the subject clandestinely peers out from its "cover" to see what is "out there" at the same time that the "out there" has already infiltrated inside 

<b></b>

 the subject. In both "Fear" and "Arab Song," it is impossible to determine precisely where the body ends and the surroundings begin. In "Fear," the "hiding" eye also bears a red slash mark, generating the sense that the eye has seen violence and is itself wounded. The painting produces the feeling of a person as composed only of an eye; the substance of the person is barely demarcated from its surroundings which are in fact also the "inside" of the person.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The eye is intensely diminished in power (it has no real body capable of action) and intensely private; but, in spite of its position of hiding or helplessness, the subject remains in revolt against an environment that contains a violence so powerful that it has entered the space of the self. </p>

<p>From the letters emerges, then, a more definite set of qualities that Bishop associated with Klee: 1) an ability to invent an unconventional form to express visceral emotion that arose from the invasion of the self (the "'violence' of tone" in "The Man of Confusion" which in "Roosters" appeared as crudely "severed" rhymes that produced the sensation of a subjectivity dissevered by its environment); 2) qualities that she valued such as "modesty, care," "determination" in the face of an acknowledgment of "helplessness"; 3) a protest or private revolt that would go beyond the protest of the Beats, 

<b></b>

 and 4) "<i>space</i>," a category emphasized by Bishop's use of an underscore but remaining undefined by her in the letter. In both paintings that Bishop mentions by name as particularly affecting her, all four categories are apparent. Both Klee's "The Man of Confusion" and "Fear" convey visceral emotion produced by a catastrophically open or severed subjectivity that is helpless, modest, but "still there," determined although in "hiding" and therefore in a position of private protest or revolt. Both paintings invent subjectivity beyond the usual idea of "person," refusing to represent the body as an integral unit or as bounded by skin. Both produce a protest by representing the situation of the eye/"I" (how the eye/"I" came to this state, its relation to its environment). Yet, it is unlikely that these paintings can serve as complete models for Bishop's interest in Klee's invention of "<i>space</i>." For some means of defining that term, we need to turn to the contemporary intellectual context for the reception of Klee in America in the late 1930s and 40s. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
II. Reception of Klee
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The closest intellectual context for Bishop can be found in her former college roommate and close friend Margaret Miller, a Research Associate and Associate Curator at MoMA. Miller made particular selections from Klee's writings for the MoMA publication on Klee that she edited in 1945. In addition, her correspondence with Christian Zervos, the editor of <i>Cahiers d'Art,</i> shows her enthusiasm for the special issue on Klee published by Zervos, which had several articles that rather lyrically rendered Klee's use of deep space. The discourse surrounding the reception of Klee, with particular attention to Miller, both reveals the general assessment of Klee as an artist working on an intimate scale, and explores his further uses of "space" beyond the uncanny and frightening relation of the eye to its own body and environment discussed above. Criticism on his paintings by John Thwaites, David Sylvester, and authors writing in <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> described the invention of a deep space that <i>undoes</i> the violence of a subjectivity open to the environment. Such critics emphasized Klee's situating of the viewer as an eye or ear wandering among a landscape of floating colors, textures, and shape motifs. As in the paintings described above, the "psycho-physical" forces in the environment served to infiltrate the viewer, removing a sense of the boundaries or membrane of the body but the fluidity occurred not only as a mode of anxiety or violence but also as pleasure and surprise. Colors and textures became mobile, "flamed and shook," infiltrated the somatic and emotional experience of a mobile self that floated, sometimes as only an eye, with its body composed of the surround. In a more structured vision of the subject's relation to its environment, the excerpts from Klee's writing chosen by Miller positioned a re in relation to objects with disparate trajectories, sizes, and speeds. Unlike "Fear" and "The Man of Confusion," the body in these paintings was not viewed solely as subjected to unseen forces but was set in a more structured and distant, controlled, relation to those forces.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Among divergent critics, one point of agreement seems to have been a stress on Klee's intimacy. "In an age that blasted privacy Paul Klee built a small but exquisite 

<b></b>

 shrine to intimacy" writes James Johnson Sweeney in the 1940 Buchholz catalogue. And Herbert Read opens his remarks in the same catalogue by declaring "Art has to choose between being monumental and intimate. A destructive age can only erect valid monuments to destruction (Picasso's <i>Guernica</i>)."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  According to Alfred H. Barr, in the publication edited by Miller, "Picasso's pictures often roar or stamp or pound; Klee's whisper a soliloquy—lyric, intimate, incalculably sensitive."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In the early and mid-1940s, critics distinguished Klee's work from the monumental egoism of Picasso. Later in the 1940s, although the abstract expressionists developed ideas that they found in Klee, he was to be distinguished from their large-scale myth-making.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Because small-scale art, modesty, and determination in the face of an acknowledged helplessness are all qualities commonly associated with Bishop's own values and poetry, we can readily see the connection between these 1940s descriptions of Klee and Bishop's interest in his work.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Bishop's report of a dream to Lloyd Frankenberg in juxtaposition to a comment in a postcard to Loren MacIver suggests that Bishop too poised Klee against the "big picture" artists:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Last night I dreamed one of the living rooms was filled with huge abstract paintings, in sections set up like screens—absolutely terrifying, for some reason. We all had to paint them; they were "compulsory" and I was reassuring some stranger that he too could do it. "All you have to remember," I said "is to paint wither [sic] a dyptich, a tryptich, or a styptich."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Whereas, two days earlier, Bishop had written to Loren MacIver, "I love the Klee book—just the thing."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  We might tentatively conclude that reading through the Klee book had given rise to the dream, the Klee paintings allowing her to acknowledge her resistance to the prevailing rules for creating "big" art. And, Bishop's interview with Ashley Brown registers just this placement of Klee, intimately scaled against the "mythic" abstract expressionists. When Brown inquires whether Bishop thinks "it is necessary for a poet to have a 'myth'—Christian or otherwise—to sustain his work," Bishop replies: "Look at Paul Klee . . . . he didn't have a formulated myth to look to, apparently, and his accomplishment was very considerable. . . I'm not interested in big-scale work as such. Something needn't be large to be good."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The response reveals Bishop's association of Klee with an alternative aesthetic to that of Christian myth as well as abstract expressionism, with its attraction to primitive myth and huge-scale paintings. Given that the abstract expressionists were understood to be painting in response to the terrors of war and to the tragic knowledge of human capacity for violence, we can see why Bishop associated Klee with another kind of protest. Likewise, Barr's and Read's contrasting of Klee with Picasso, particularly in his monumental protest against war, sheds some light on the way that art on an intimate scale set itself in protest to a world of violence but in a quiet, private voice rather than monumental gestures. </p>

<p>The nature of this protest entailed Klee's movement away from depicting the self's awareness of bodily severance or invasion by extreme violence. Critics discussed many paintings by Klee that provided, rather, a structure for openness to the environment. 

<b></b>

 In these paintings, the subject matter of the painting seemed to be the viewer himself who becomes relocated <i>in</i> the canvas, sometimes as a floating eye in the landscape (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). The eye, a consciousness open to multisensory experience, wanders in a landscape. The eye is bodiless but nevertheless touched and moved by floating motifs (stick-like trees) where sheets of red and orange drift across the membrane of the (now missing) body. Klee's critics stressed especially his innovative construction of this new feel for space. John Thwaites, who wrote at the time that Bishop first became interested in Klee in 1937, taught his readers to experience Klee's innovative deep space by feeling their way inside it. The "eye" of the viewer wanders inside the space of the painting as if floating through a landscape where the parts of that landscape have the tactile feel of textures and atmospheres available to a body in motion. Thwaites emphasized Klee's interest in conveying the object not as the stilled cubist object, frozen in time, but the object as it existed in multiple sensory dimensions. While Braque, according to Thwaites, can only deliver a "strong way of seeing," Klee captures nonvisual perception in addition to the visual: "Klee is interested in movement because he is interested in the object in all its ways of being. The object in space or in time, in sight or in sound, in temperature or in touch, interest him equally."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Hence, Thwaites emphasized Klee's use of texture to build in a more visceral, somatic element beyond the optical: "he learned to use texture, not as the cubists did for a plastic feeling of the object, but to give a psycho-physical reaction." Such a view clarified the link between Klee's use of color ("the color is laid on in undefined areas like stains") and his production of a sense of movement: "the red-brown surfaces vary in intensity, letting your eye through to different depths as the Chinese sepia does. Then a fistful of blue breaks through the sky and is echoed in a blue border like Seurat's. That color relation makes the little landscape flame and shake." Thwaites emphasizes the way that Klee unfolds the colors and textures of objects into movements: "He brings a Greco-Roman fold out of an arabesque, but you feel it fall and settle."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  While the mood, here, has softened and has nothing to do with the vulnerability of the re in "Fear," colors and textures "touch" the body and the mind of the viewer, who has gone over the frame of the painting to float among colors and textures inside the landscape.  </p>

<p>In the first issue of <i>The Tiger's Eye</i> (which Bishop alluded to in a letter to Lowell), David Sylvester similarly described Klee's invention of a new space filled with movement in contrast to cubist space which held the object frozen: "the movement of the motifs themselves defines the fluid space they inhabit."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The viewer must "feel into" the painting, Sylvester elaborated, in order "to explore those perspectives already visible from outside. A late Klee is the face of a cliff. To 'feel into' it is to clamber over it" (<i>AMA </i>37). Sylvester is even clearer in a 1951 essay about the late Klee:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>While the spectator <i>may</i> project himself into any picture, he <i>must </i>project himself into a late Klee. . . . As the spectator moves between the signs of the Berne pictures, he feels, not that he is traveling on a surface, but that he is suspended in space and that the structure of the picture is three-dimensional. This is in spite of the fact that it contains none of the devices—linear or serial perspective, plastic colour, overlapping of forms—normally used to give an illusion of depth and space. And, indeed, no space is signified so long as the 

<b></b>

 spectator confronts the picture. Yet when he projects himself into it and moves about in it, the signs situate themselves at different depths, thereby implying space. </p>

<p class="continued">In Klee's space, the subject of the painting and the viewer himself are suspended or "swimming" (Sylvester) in a landscape of different textures, atmospheres, and motifs, many of which carry what Thwaites referred to as a "psycho-physical" effect.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  In some paintings, the eye in the landscape flips the viewer so that she is not merely traveling through the landscape but actually is the eye of the landscape's body (see <a href="#3"> 3</a>).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As the later scholar, Carolyn Lanchner, summarizes it: "The space . . . is organic weightless, and indeterminate . . . deeper [than Cubist space]. It has become metaphysical, iconic with the painter's and the viewer's interior space, both sensuous and ideographic."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Several of the essays on Klee in the 1945/46 issue of <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> (which Margaret Miller admired and would have shared with Bishop) emphasize that Klee's mode of seeing involved a visceral and somatic openness in a fluid space of floating motifs.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Roger Vitrac began his essay "Le regard de Paul Klee," by emphasizing the receptiveness and clarity of Klee's vision ("<i>au fond de l'oeil le plus limpide</i>").<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The eye, in its receptiveness, felt open and waiting, like an ear open at night. The body itself seemed open, operating with an extensive network of heightened sensory awareness based in the organic or botanical level of the body ("<i>des sens et des passions les nervures grandissantes de la connaissance</i>"). Vitrac described a viewer encountering depths of anxiety, a vertiginous falling ("<i>les vertiges</i>") into realms usually forbidden to our view, dreams of despair, shame, and silence (<i>CA,</i> 53, 54). For Georges Duthuit, the viewer moved in the space of a Klee painting as if walking backward blindfolded at night, feeling traps underfoot and encountering small flashes of living things, eyes of trout, flowers glowing like nightlights at the bottom of a pond ("<i>les yeux bandés, marcher á reculons: trop de pièges sous nos pas . . . La scène s'éclaire des petits yeux de la truite et des fleurs en veilleuse, au fond de l'étang</i>"<i>)</i> (<i>CA</i> 20)<i>.</i> Christian Zervos wrote that Klee "inserts us into the mystery of a world of shifting, fluctuating boundaries" ("<i>a nous insinuer le mystère de ce monde aux frontièrs flotantes</i>") (<i>CA,</i> 16). Several of the <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> critics emphasized the paintings' immense silence, imagining both painter and viewer hanging in space, stretching out via the ear toward the world, consciousness open and stretching beyond the boundary of the body so that colors, textures, and motifs seem to cross into the interior space of the self (Bousquet, <i>CA, </i>50–1; Grohman, <i>CA,</i> 63–5).  </p>

<p>One other mode of the organization of "space" emerges from Klee's own writings that Miller excerpted in a 1945 MoMA publication. Miller mentioned the booklet twice in letters to Bishop, and Bishop's interest in Klee and friendship with Miller makes it highly likely that the poet read these particular excerpts.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  In his remarks "On Creation," Klee revealed his interest in setting up relationships between various kinds of movements, shapes, lines, and times (opposing "forces") in the space of one painting. The subject, even while moving, is suspended amongst this array of other shapes and movements:

<p class="continued">In both passages, Klee jogs loose painting's adherence to the planar and resituates it so that both the subject of the painting and the viewer are oriented inside a wider world, filled with trajectories of different shapes, densities and directions, moving at variant paces and durations. These shape-motifs do not diffuse across the space of the self, the way that sheets of color cross into the eye in "Glance of a Landscape" or burlap texture crosses into the body in "Fear." The res in these paintings are not imagined as open to the environment across a missing boundary or membrane; nevertheless they retain an orientation toward motifs in the landscape which somehow "bound" or circle them. In the man on the steamer, the re is not so much subjected to those outside trajectories and forces as held in relation to them. He moves in relation to their movements. Pacing on the deck, he has a certain degree of independence from the forces ranged around him, but he is nevertheless "held" within the relation of their disparate shapes and movements. In the passage about the sleeping person, the sleeping 

<b></b>

 consciousness is held at a distance from but in relation to the movements of his own body (the circulation of the blood, the movement of the lungs) and then, at an even greater distance, the movements of his more amorphously shaped dreams and then his "fate." In both Klee excerpts, the re is opened to and held by an environment located outside the direct control of the subject. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
III. Bishop's use of Klee's Aesthetic
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Both unpublished and published poetry of Bishop from the mid-1940s demonstrates a widespread affinity between Bishop's developing aesthetic in this period and Klee's work. The positioning of the speaker in these lyrics experiences an openness to the environment, not always in the mode of bodily severance or invasion but in a milder aspect whereby fields of color and texture cross the boundary of a form, the speaker is placed within a "complex of movements," or suspended within different kinds of lines and shapes. At times, Bishop renders the crossing of those boundaries by submerging the body or subject in its environment or surround, effacing the subject, and leaving only an "eye" which is itself variously saturated by an environment that is also, somehow, the eye's own body—resembling Klee's use of an "eye" floating bodiless in space, where the landscape becomes the "eye's" body.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Bishop's unpublished and perhaps not fully achieved poem, "On the 'Prince of Fundy'" (1946 or 1947), allows us to watch the poet experiment with Klee's aesthetic. The poem creates a "complex of movement." Like the man on the steamer in Miller's excerpt of Klee's writing, which placed a man walking forward on a steamer's deck in relation to the different pace and direction of the movement of the ship, the revolution of the earth, and the orbiting moon and stars, Bishop's poem similarly suspends the speaker in relation to disparate speeds, directions, and circulating shapes in a "complex of movements": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "Prince of Fundy"<br />
We must weigh tons and tons and tons<br />
with all those cars &amp; cars &amp; trucks<br />
Stowed below.<br />

We gently gently rock this way and that.<br />
Someone has a heavy tread, above.<br />

And why does she sing so high?<br />

There's nothing real to judge by.<br />
(I love you more today than I did yesterday.<br />

Why are they walking around like that<br />
And singing, too, at all hours of the night?
<b></b>
<br />

While we sway gently gently in the dark<br />
(up, down and sometimes sidewise, too)<br />
We shall be arriving at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia in<br />
Approximately two hours and twenty-five minutes.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Recalling Klee's positioning of the man on the steamer among a range of differently timed movements and shapes, "On the 'Prince of Fundy'" suspends the speaker on a ferry amidst opposing weights, movements, shapes, and lines. It opens with the sense of weight pulled downward (the "weight of tons and tons and tons " of "cars &amp; cars &amp; trucks / stowed below") and sets that weight in tension with the light airy high voice of a woman singing ("And why does she sing so high?"). Suspended between these poles, the cabin is a dark hole which introduces another form of movement ("we gently rock") into the existing field, a movement where situational instability is increased by the epistemological inability to "judge" against any firm stable horizon or marker ("WE <i>think</i> we rock because / there's nothing real to judge by"). Instability becomes the site where another kind of possibility opens. Inside that space of gentle rocking, suspended somewhere between weighty immobile depth and airy wavering height, emotion has altered, shifted into a more joyous affirmation ("I love you more today than I did yesterday. / Isn't that nice?"). The affirmation is without cause or motive, a "free" and gentle event that "floats up" inside of a matrix of other movements and events, a shift that could just as easily have been other. The shift comes without preparation, appearing inside a field of other objects, movements, and events—some of long duration and others intermittent. Its own continuity cannot be known (will it be a long period of shared loved or a brief sensation soon to dissipate?). After the emotional shift, the "field" continues, surrounding the event. A shape/movement of circling ("why are they walking around like that") of fairly extensive duration ("at all hours of the night") holds inside and slightly below itself the cabin, still dark and gently swaying, "up, down and sometimes sidewise, too." Another "line" is introduced at the close, one in which the ship has a directness, moving unidirectionally, straight towards a named and stable destination in a named duration ("two hours and twenty-five minutes") with a minuscule uncertainty ("approximately" as spoken in the official voice of announcer of timetables and schedules). We can recognize the kind of "arrow" shape frequently used by Klee in the unidirectional movement of steamer toward port. </p>

<p>"On the 'Prince of Fundy'" can function as a particularly clear example of Bishop's situating a "complex of movements" in relation to one another and to an observer, comparable to the man on a steamer or the man in repose in the excerpts from Klee's writings on modern art. Keeping in mind "On the 'Prince of Fundy,''" and Klee's writings, we can more fully comprehend the final poem in <i>A Cold Spring,</i> Bishop's tribute to her love for Lota de Macedo Soares in "The Shampoo," composed in 1951. Bishop herself was surprised when the <i>New Yorker</i> first rejected the poem and when readers did not seem to understand it, while she considered it to be without difficulty. The poem becomes more accessible when set in the context of the excerpt about the man 

<b></b>

 walking forward on the steamer. "The Shampoo" gently suspends the human res in relation to the speed, scale, and shape of heavenly orbits and earthly objects. The poem is short enough to be quoted in full: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The still explosions on the rocks,<br />
The lichens, grow<br />
By spreading, gray, concentric shocks.<br />
They have arranged<br />
To meet the rings around the moon, although<br />
Within our memories they have not changed.</p>
<p>
And since the heavens will attend<br />
As long on us,<br />

Precipitate and pragmatical;<br />
And look what happens. For Time is<br />
Nothing if not amenable.</p>
<p>

Are flocking where,<br />
So straight, so soon?<br />

battered and shiny like the moon.</p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The speaker of "The Shampoo" and her lover are suspended among shapes and lines that also contain movements of varying speeds. Lichens, as circles, will take much longer than our memories can hold to grow far enough "to meet the rings around the moon." These circles, slow, capacious, are poised against other shapes and speeds, such as Lota's white hairs, like comets, that shoot more precipitously towards the moon. The precipitous, precocious movement of shooting lines is contained by another shape, the circle of the tin basin where Lota's hair will be washed. In the middle stanza, poised or "hung" between these two kinds of time (imagined as shapes with variant speeds), there is the trajectory of the meeting of the lovers themselves. They too could have waited much longer to meet or to enter into a loving relationship (as "the heavens will attend / as long on us") but Lota has been "precipitate and pragmatical" not only by growing gray hair but also by inviting Elizabeth to live with her sooner rather than later. "Time" is "amenable" to this arrangement; the warmth of that word "amenable" with its shades of amiable and accommodating, and its softness against the harsher member of the rhymed pair, "pragmatical," creates a soft atmosphere, implying that the Time (and the stanza) in which the lovers reside is suspended amiably, unhurriedly amidst the harsher "shocks" "rocks" "shooting stars" and "tin." The fact that the time of that second stanza is like the time of the first allows the interval in which they are suspended to be elongated beyond even human memory and makes the felt experience of their love more expansive than the little action of the shampoo. Their love then can hang inside of that expanded space, while also acknowledging its eventual limit (closed 

<b></b>

 by the aging and death that are signaled by the white hairs that move too quickly and the aging "battered" basin). The lovers are suspended amidst motifs of circles and lines that vary in speeds and carry "psycho-physical" forces. The proliferative "spray" is played against more controlled "intact" forms: "still explosions on the rocks" are also rings ("concentric shocks"). The straight, exploding lines of Lota's hair are contained, in the final stanza, by the circular shape of the "big tin basin." The proliferative lives of these two women, that could have gone anywhere, and dispersed, are now inside a container of sorts, since their growth has "arranged" to "meet the rings around the moon" and they meet inside the circle of the basin, the loving action of the shampoo, and their own room or space of living together. The subjectivity of both speaker and lover has become dispersed or distributed in and among shapes other than themselves, shapes which are provided by the natural and human environments and which also provide containers for subjectivity. </p>

<p>For an equally clear demonstration of an abovementioned technique of Klee's work, noted by both American and European critics—that of allowing fields of color and texture to cross the boundary of a form and the suspension of the "I" in a field of floating motifs—we can first turn to Bishop's own notebook observations that constitute her raw material for many poems. Bishop repeatedly shows an interest and takes pleasure in the dispersal of drops through a three-dimensional field, suspended in emulsion then dissolving. Often she describes different textures or atmospheres of different densities touching or passing through each other. To select one of numerous examples, here is a note taken while staying in North Carolina:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>October. The nights of the full moon this month were beautiful. The mountains looked bluish, snowy, &amp; wasted. Gay sparks from the little river floated through the black oak trees. Then a thin, high, silvery fog came through all the valleys, from different directions—watched it coming closer &amp; closer until it came through the oak trees, hid them &amp; then through the screens into the room which suddenly got very cold. </p>

<p>We can see this interest in sparseness, diffusion, varying atmospheres and textures crossing one another in a short poem, probably from Key West, "Mimosas in Bloom" (perhaps to be associated with her painting "Graveyard with Fenced Graves").<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The poem shows Bishop's delight in textures meeting one another, their mode of touching or passing through: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

<p class="continued">

 Fineness, softness, gentleness occur in different registers: the less dense, "barely there" of the "air-light litter" in the petals or pollen from the trees next to/against the comparatively denser, more solid but still light in weight substance of the "gray-green leaves / . . . like kittens' ears." In another register, the diffused golden pollen crosses into the even more diffused realm of air as, by a tiny adjustment of weight and color, the pollen that filters over the hills becomes diffused like golden light. A notebook entry renders the same subject and thematizes it: "the ground that would dry their [the mourners] tears like / Blotting paper—in the cemetery— / And let it through, scarcely detaining / it, to join the sea below" (SCV, 75.3, 14). Here tears gently dissolve into the earth of the graveyard, and their gentleness in this dissolution is associated with an acceptance of death. These notebook passages prepare us for textures and colors diffusing across the boundaries of other forms or across the membrane of the self in a mode other than fear and violence. </p>

<p>In another unpublished fragment from this period, "The night intact," lovers are set as a barely distinguishable object (only the mouths visible) in a field of other objects, movements, atmospheres, and textures: </p>

<p class="continued">This unfinished draft gathers power from its reversal of the aubade tradition, which only managed to wish the night prolonged, the sun delayed. Here, the speaker and her lover bring back "the night intact" when they kiss. Inside the "(brilliant) white room" they bring into being and also receive an enabling darkness as a "gift" descending from above. The darkness, imagined as a "fountain" or spray rising and spreading or raining down also appears concentrated, not diffused, at the place where the two mouths meet. The steady climbing movement of a gradual darkening ("it grew dark / &amp; darker as we went upstairs") stands slightly ajar from the two poles of darkness imagined as "intact" 

<b></b>

 and "fountain." Somewhere between the different densities of darkness imagined as a concentrated whole ("intact") and imagined as a diffusion or spray ("fountain"), the room itself "holds" the darkness in a less dense, airy way. The "space" of the brilliant white room surrounding the lovers holds the darkness inside of its airy openness, suspended in it, like an emulsion. The feeling of suspension derives from the lovers' movement upward rather than downward and from the way that the upstairs room is an enclosure open to the outdoors. Outside of that space, but also inside because present in the speaker's awareness, there is a different kind of diffusion of color or movement, "palm trees swaying &amp; / clashing like (taffeta) bright tin blue flowers" (not the movement of the gradual climbing upstairs nor the stopped movement of the intactness of two mouths meeting). The taffeta and the palm fronds both yield up an image of a diffused, netlike or ragged texture, becoming even more ragged when described as dotted with a multitude of "tin blue flowers." Textures "touch" one another or infiltrate. Ragged fronds swaying and crashing, the stiff harsh brushing of taffeta, tin blue flowers are all agitated surfaces that stand apart from (but also serve to characterize the other mood of) the more sedate shifting of planes in the thematics of a "misplaced" night. In this case, one set of images of excitement or agitation hovers like a penumbra around the borders of the room and, because the poem is about two lovers' passionate return to each other in the day, the movement at the edges is implicitly also occurring in the unshown, dark center where the two mouths meet.  </p>

<p>"Night intact" suspends the speaker in a field of shape motifs that, in Thwaites's terminology, have clearly become "psycho-physical" fields of force. In these drafts, and in "The Shampoo," as in Klee's paintings, movements, lines, speeds, shapes ("motifs") in complex relation to one another become the setting in which a subject is suspended but also, simultaneously, expressive of that subject. As in Klee's laying of transparent washes of color across each other or across the boundaries of a form in "Glance of a Landscape," we see the crossing or infiltration of the subject by atmospheres or textures from the environment. The boundary line around the subject becomes indistinct so that the subject, while still holding the objects of the environment at a distance, experiences them somatically as simultaneously inside, part of the interior feeling of the self. While the paintings "Fear" and "The Man of Confusion" showed the invasion of the violence of the environment across the boundary of skin, "Night Intact" and "Shampoo" situate the speaker in an openness to the shapes, movements, colors, and textures of a milder environment. The speaker and her lover are suspended among these shapes and textures, and the psycho-physical forces arranged around the speaker become the range of her interior experience. </p>

<p>A later draft, entitled "Gypsophilia," set in Samambia after Bishop moved to Brazil in 1951 (too long and occurring in too many versions to quote in full), again suspends the speaker (as "we") in a deep fluid space amidst a field of shape motifs of varying speeds and directionalities.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Standing high on a mountain, in a diffuse terrain where the "air is thinner" and the "blue / deteriorates," the speaker is crossed by the "hard and thin" sounds of a voice yelling "<i>Din-ner</i>!" and the metallic clang of someone beating an iron bar in the orchid nursery below. The presumably sedentary speaker herself 

<b></b>

 seems to be floating off ("The last clangs are / the last words of a bell-bouy out at sea," [<i>SCV,</i> 66.5]). Standing high on the mountain in her "cold sub-stratum of dew," she is also floating beneath a circling spray of white stars and so appears to be at the bottom of a deep space. When Manuelzinho's family appears on the road below, carrying burdens, the speaker is suspended among a different set of shape-motifs, resembling "the spiky things Klee loves, sprays of grass or reeds, fronds or fir twigs or the backbones of fishes."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  The family, carrying "a load of dead branches," and an "enormous sheaf" of "'Gypophilia [sic],' 'baby's breath'," with Manuelzhino's wife possessing "hair hang[ing] down under . . . an old felt hat," is rendered as a series of short straight lines, not quite aligned, first lying sideways (the branches as they are carried), then pointing downward (the hair), and then pointing upward in a tiny set of explosions (the "baby's breath"). Later, the speaker imagines herself as a small, dark, condensed black seed carried or "borne" in the "minutely, whitely, blossoming sprays" of white stars above ("a dead black seed / caught somewhere / caught, somehow, and carried, carried / in those glimmering sprays about us," [<i>SCV,</i> 66.5]). She terms the spray a "fascicle," the exfoliated, bursting shape of a flower's stamens. Invisible at the center of a circle of a white spray of stars, the lyric speaker is suspended, borne along, "carried." As in "Night Intact," the speaker of "Gypsophilia" hangs among floating motifs that are arrayed about the speaker and cross into the interior, felt as "psycho-physical" forces. </p>

<p>Again and again Bishop shows us surfaces that modulate in texture or tactility, that open and become airy or diffuse and allow infiltration by other colors, atmospheres, or textures. Resembling the painting "Fear," this fascination with infiltration is not merely the aesthetics of placing color against color, shade against shade, texture against texture, but involves a particular kind of ontology that sees subjects as partially open, airy, crossed by the textures and movements of the environment and modulated by the intricate density of that environment. While in "Fear," the crossing into the boundary of the subject occurs in the mood of a deep anxiety about infiltration, other moods—as we have seen in "Night Intact" and "Gypsophilia"—are possible. The boundary of the body can be dangerously open, when unable to prevent frightening forces from crossing into it (the arrows at the right-hand edge of "Fear" emphasize this effect) or more pleasurably open, when other kinds of "psycho-physical" fields cross its membrane. Like the bodiless eye floating among drifting reddish-orange diaphanous sheets of color in "Glance of the Landscape," Bishop's speaker in "Gypsophilia" stands in an atmosphere where "blue deteriorates" or the sound of metal drifts away, like "the last word of a bell-buoy." The speaker hangs as eye or ear in that deep space, among objects that float toward or away. The release of the line from bounding the re in Klee's work is closely related to the subject's perception that the surface of the body is incompletely and incoherently sensed from inside, and cannot properly "bound" the ego. Ultimately, Bishop's noting of an "I' comes closest to the mobility of Klee's staging of an "event" in which an object "appears" in a field that did not before contain it but that immediately rearranges itself, opens, to hold it. The self is not the center of that occurrence. The "I" is itself a kind of field, and its elements, variously remote or close, both inside and outside the skin, resituate the speaker as the environment changes. These lines, shapes, 

<b></b>

 motifs, and orbits cause the registering of sensation in the perceiver, rearranging and creating anew the proprioceptive subject. As Henri Wallon defines it, 'proprioceptivity' is the result of the "gathering together and unification of otherwise disparate and scattered sensations provided by the various sense organs, in all their different spaces and registers."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The experience of sensation causes an identification-at-a-distance, as Kaja Silverman terms it, and diffuses the sense of the "I" so that it is "stretched" among the atmospheres, textures, and objects of the "surround."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Bishop's own favorite of the poems in <i>A Cold Spring,</i> "Faustina, or Rock Roses," demonstrates most clearly the way that different textures and shapes infiltrating one another includes not merely a visual aesthetic but an ontology of the subject. In this poem, as in "Fear" and "Glance of a Landscape," we become intensely conscious of eyes in bodies that are open to the atmosphere. Suspending the speaker in a deep fluid space of floating shapes and materials that open into or drift across that speaker, Bishop creates a dynamic sense of subjectivity intensely vulnerable to an environment that can diffuse across its boundaries and yet also be held in suspension among its objects. The poem, about Bishop's visit to an invalid under the care of a Key West black woman, Faustina, appears as a collage of variously textured whites.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Inside the invalid's room, the various surfaces are layered across or next to one another: the white on white of the fine lines of hair on the white pillow, nightgown against undershirt, the papery "pallid palm-leaf fan" that the papery pallid invalid is too weak to wield (<i>CP,</i> 72). Textures vary from smooth to encrusted to opening: the white enamel of the bed frame with its surface crazed; the loosely dotted powder of talcum; the rough, more solidly meshed "pasteboard boxes" and the condensed but ornamented spheres of pills with their encrusted surface "half-crystallized"—these are textures that open toward each other, varying in the diffuseness or "openness" of their surfaces. They will dissolve away, like the flags with their patterns and images "bleached" away (<i>CP,</i> 73). The field of whites occasionally moves through various kinds of luminosity and occasionally rises to a color, and Bishop orchestrates their emergence in the mode that Klee's critics described, as flashes encountered, floating up into view: dew that "glint[s]" on the mesh of the screen door, two glow-worms beyond the screen with their subdued light not quite emergent from a dark field ("burning a drowned green"), the harsh lighting from a bare bulb that suddenly makes tack heads glint, the "wall-pocket, / violet-embossed, glistening / with mica flakes." The surfaces sometimes move or open or wilt: the bedposts that unfurl into "four vaguely roselike / flower-formations," the undulating lines of the sagging floorboards, the white sheets, with their undulating lines and dissolving enervated folds "like wilted roses." We should see these motifs in relation to Klee's insistence on the textures of objects that erupt into movement and which the viewer feels as "psycho-physical" effects. </p>

<p>The res in the poem are suspended within this field of textures, and the human res' interiors can open out extensively or toward various depths like the other materials in the room. Beyond, at the edges of the various whites, lurk several darks. A night deep and dark enough to semi-drown the glow-worms' two green lights hangs beyond the room. The night is a hole that one could step out into and become lost 

<b></b>

 in. Inside the white space, other "holes" appear. In the white room that constantly fluctuates between two and three dimensions, the visitor herself and the interaction between the visitor and the invalid woman remain shadowed, almost invisible, silent, effaced, like holes that are deeper than the rest of the space. The question of whether the women will "open out" to one another is central. No words are spoken between visitor and invalid. The visitor is only known as a re that deviates from that white-on-white environment:  </p>

<p class="continued">Full of a gentle "embarrassed" pathos, Bishop captures the shame of the still-living in the presence of the dying. The almost-effaced assertion, in that gentle "perhaps," marks the visitor as caught in the embarrassing situation of being embarrassed by living instead of dying. She is too ashamed to "show" in the picture. Her invisibility becomes a kind of hiding, a not-wanting to be so embarrassingly bright or alive. Because the next line is "by and by the whisper / says" we know that the speaker has been sitting in silence for some time, suspended inside the space of the collage of whites and hearing only the inaudible whispered words of the invalid. We do not see the invalid's face, which occurs only as the blank from which the whisper issues. We see/feel the visitor only as "perhaps the reverse" of "pain," "age," and "nakedness." Neither the face of the visitor, nor the face of the invalid, comes into focus (the invalid's surround has been shown but not her face). Both the invalid's face and the speaker's even less visible face sink (almost) into the environment so that only the eyes are visible—like the eye in "Fear" that hides in its body composed of the textured burlap of the environment.  </p>

<p>As in "Glance of a Landscape," which suspended the "eye" in a landscape of drifting sheets of color and spiky stick shapes, this poem suspends the speaker in a complex of shapes, lines, and textures of different densities moving across or through one another, opening into one another, closing to one another. Distinct from the white on white environment and these deeper "holes" in that environment, the black face of the caretaker, Faustina, looms with an engulfing suddenness as the focal point and is viewed, in a strange and "sickening" reversal, as if the visitor were in the sick bed looking up. </p>

<p class="continued">

The face is condensed in the two words "sinister kind" ("her sinister kind face / presents a cruel black / coincident conundrum") so that opposed meanings and contrasting sounds cohere in a tight space juxtaposed to one another. The binary falls or collapses into itself in the phrase "coincident conundrum" where the similarities of consonants and vowels, their "nearness" to each other, make the binaries cohere even more closely in a denser relationship, as if a pattern of contrasts can become tighter and finally the contrasts can squeeze into the same space as one other. Then contrast or pattern opens out, briefly, for a second, with the light, airy, long-drawn, upward inflection of "Oh, is it / freedom at last, a lifelong / dream of time and silence, / dream of protection and rest?" The two blank spaces between stanzas—after "oh, is it" and "rest?"—provide intervals that are suspended, uplifted in hope. Just afterwards, the line comes down sharply, "Or is it the very worst?" The horror is intensified by "rest" in slant rhyme with "worst," again pressing contrasts together in an uncomfortable embrace. Then, "shape" leaps out of the scene, which until now has been largely texture against texture of only slightly opening or unfolding whites (varied by the small glints and glows and the "holes" of the invisible faces and the dark night). As if leaping out of the deep space of Faustina's black face, "The acuteness of the question / forks instantly and starts / a snake-tongue flickering; / blurs further, blunts, softens, / separates, falls, our problems / becoming helplessly / proliferative." The sudden explosion of squiggly lines, uncontained, is unlike anything that has been seen in the poem thus far (meshes, textures, of white on white, or little squares—the wall pocket—or rounded forms that open out only as far as something like a rose). This little chaos of sharp sticklike propulsive lines (the question felt as a shape, "acuteness" experienced as shape), is then condensed into the two eyes. The proliferative questions are held inside two darkened unreadable circles ("the eyes say only either"). At the close of the poem, the "proliferative" is carried over into the bunch of roses that the visitor hands the invalid, roses that have a "blurred" or infiltrated section of rust and which begin to disperse in a spray of petals. The interiors of the speaker, the invalid, and even Faustina open out, become opaque or unreadable, turn propulsive, cross over into one another, reclose. Subjectivity, suspended in its fluid space of floating textures and motifs, can be infiltrated or invaded in a mood of geniality or fear.  

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>Even more striking, Bishop seems to produce in this poem the kind of reversal of viewer/object that Klee produced through placing a floating eye in a landscape or an eye inside a body submerged in the surround. The viewer of Klee's "Glance of a Landscape," when entering the painting in the way that Thwaites and Sylvester suggest, clambering over into it, finds himself suddenly inside the painting and now located in the eye, looking out, with the painted landscape serving as the viewer's body. So, too, the speaker of "Faustina, or Rock Roses" flips from watching the invalid at the bedside to inhabiting the invalid's body, which is partly composed of the "body" of the room of whites surrounded by an unknown night. Both sets of eyes (the invalid's and the speaker's) then stare up into the downward-leaning eyes of Faustina, as, in fact, the reader of the poem is likewise forced to do.  </p>

<p>As a viewer of Klee's paintings in the late 1930s and 1940s, Bishop would have been taught by critics such as John Thwaites, David Sylvester, and the critics in <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> to move past the two-dimensional surface of Klee's paintings and cross over into the deep space where the eye wanders among moving motifs and engages in intimate and quasi-physical encounters with a sequence of variously dense or diffuse materials that infiltrate the "body" of the subject. Positioned inside the picture, the viewer, like the speaker in these Bishop poems, drifts in a weightless deep space in relation to a complex of shapes and lines moving at various speeds, crossed by textures and atmospheres of variant densities, the empathic subject of a bedazzling variety of "psycho-physical" objects and environments. Textures or atmospheres lying against, infiltrating, passing through, falling into, glancing off, undulating and dissolving planes, spiky, circling, explosive lines: these sites for surfaces to sink into or reach out into depth become the subject of much of <i>A Cold Spring</i> (as well as the subject of "The Moose," which Bishop began in this period). The diffused and the dispersed, the open and the closed, the proliferative and the contained become a political subject (in "A View of the Capitol from the Library of Congress") or a deeply human one (in Faustina or "The Shampoo"). </p>

<p>Finally, "The Shampoo," "On the 'Prince of Fundy,'" "Night intact like that," "Gypsophilia," and "Faustina" allow us to see the existential or ontological import of Bishop's interest in depicting a range of textures, kinds of concentration and diffusion, colors, and luminosities simultaneously "touching", crossing, and sometimes sharing one another's "spaces" or reflecting off, and obstructing one another. "Faustina," especially, reveals the way that human relationships and human questions are felt as the opening and closing, appearance and disappearance of shapes or lines that project out or are introjected across the various "materials" of the environment and the self. Skin, as drawn boundary around the subject, diminishes into near-invisibility as the space of the self becomes crossed by or suspended among other objects and textures. The paintings singled out by Bishop in her correspondence about Klee picture massive disintegration or near effacement of the body, leaving an eye (or eyes) submerged in a "field." Therefore Bishop's frequent use of a nearly effaced or submerged speaker, only arising gradually and gently to speak the "I" from within a multitude of acts of perception and relations with a landscape, becomes most visible to us when understood as the poetic corollary to Paul Klee's floating eyes submerged in landscape or surroundings, crossed 

<b></b>

 by atmospheres and textures and suspended within a "complex of movements." For Bishop, depth took on a visceral and somatic aspect that replaced Moore's Christian metaphysics. Bishop located the eye/"I" deeply, extensively, and expressively within the complex relations of a mobile environment of other motifs, bodies, and textures folding into and across one another's surfaces. The speaker in Bishop's poems is like Klee's staging of an "event" in which an object "appears" in a field that did not before contain it but that immediately rearranges itself and opens to hold it. The self is not the center of that occurrence. The "I" is itself a kind of field. As in the paintings "Fear," "The Man of Confusion," and "Glance of a Landscape," the eye/"I" almost without skin becomes witness to and host of the "events" of the environment in which it hangs.  </p>

Richard Mullen ("Elizabeth Bishop's Surrealist Inheritance," <i>American Literature</i> 54 [March 1982]: 63–80) has shown that Bishop both drew on and distinguished herself from the surrealists. Lorrie Goldensohn has compared Bishop's own watercolors to her poems ("Elizabeth Bishop's Written Pictures, Painted Poems," <i>"In Worcester, Massachusetts" Essays on Elizabeth Bishop From the 1997 Elizabeth Bishop Conference at WPI </i>ed. Laura Jen Menides and Angela G. Dorenkamp [New York :Peter Lang], 167–76) and has written about perspective and perception in Bishop's poetry, as well as extended Mullen's work (<i>Elizabeth Bishop, The Biography of a Poetry</i> [New York: Columbia University Press, 1992], 118–134. Bonnie Costello (<i>Elizabeth Bishop, Questions of Mastery</i> [Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1991]) has written extensively on Bishop's use of perspective. Her argument is broader than can be summarized here but includes an emphasis on Bishop's "points of view that discovered or acknowledged their inadequacy, that expressed uncertainty or need and could not account for everything before them" . Costello argues that Bishop's "experiments with odd and multiple perspectives, with radical shifts of frame and scale, with temporal conditions of observations, provide her with the visual language for representing a fluent, temporal subjectivity" . Costello has also drawn out the aesthetics implied in Bishop's poems about paintings (214–33). Ernesto Suarez-Toste ("'Telling It Slant': The 'Healthier' Surrealism of Elizabeth Bishop and Joseph Cornell," <i>Revista Canaria de Estudios Ingleses</i> 42 [2001]: 279–88 has explored the affinity between Bishop and Joseph Cornell. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT10" href="#REF10">10</a>. In spite of periodically telling Anne Stevenson that the biographer's work must be her own and that Bishop wishes to avoid directing the line of argument for the biography, Bishop tries to prevent Stevenson from associating the poetry too closely with the surrealists and Max Ernst. Bishop throws out an alternative track for Stevenson to follow, naming Klee and Schwitters: "You mention Ernst 

<b></b>

 again. Oh dear–I wish I'd never mentioned him at all, because I think he's usually a dreadful painter. I liked that <i>Histoire Naturelle</i> I mentioned, and his photo-collages still seem brilliant. Klee I like, of course, and Schwitters—but then I like so much painting" (Letter to Anne Stevenson, January 8 , 1964, Washington University Libraries, Department of Special Collections, Manuscript Division, St Louis, MI.) Even though Bishop backs off her choice to single out Klee and Schwitters by adding the phrase "but then I like so much painting," we should hear it as significant that she chose Klee and Schwitters to be the two names brought forward to counter the mistaken association with Ernst. </p>

According to Dietrich, Schwitters "maintained his ties to Expressionism even after his adoption of a medium—collage—that is usually thought of as having been conceived in opposition to it" .

<p><a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>. The characteristics of "modesty," "care," "determination in the face of an acknowledgement of helplessness" likely derive from Klee's use of a "wandering line," an important subject for Bishop but not one that I can cover in this essay. The later critic Andrew Kagan ("Paul Klee's Influence on American Painting: New York School," <i>Arts Magazine</i> June [1975]), interpreting Klee's influence on 1940s visual art, can help us to connect this use of space with the issue of modesty: "Klee's line functions as an independent and autonomous pictorial element, never bound to the description of volume, and often free from the task of bounding forms . . . Klee's improvisatory drawing does not grip space rigidly and declare it by force. It rather displaces and inflects a highly fluid pictorial depth . . . " . Klee allows fields of color and texture to cross the boundary of a form, largely because line does not define volume or bound a form. This feeling of space loosely held corresponds to the sense of modesty in Klee that Bishop so admired. It is probably related to her commonly acknowledged epistemology of uncertain movement toward knowledge, and, a handwritten phrase in the letter to Lowell, added as afterthought to the list of "modesty, care, <i>space,</i> determination in the face of helplessness" suggests this epistemology: the note adds to the list of qualities another item: "and admission of final ignorance" (January 29, 1958, Robert Lowell Papers, BMSAm1905, Houghton Library, Harvard University). </p>

Miller wrote enthusiastically to Christian Zervos about the first edition of <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> (1945–1946) to appear after the war, which began with a fifty-page tribute to Klee (Registrar Exhibition Files, Exh. #385. The Museum of Modern Art Archives, New York). Many of the paintings reproduced in that issue involved the sense of deep space, the viewer wandering among motifs, or persons submerged in a landscape (for the latter, see especially "Dans L'Herbe" and "Personage dans le Jardin"). Unfortunately, only Miller's letters to Bishop survive; nevertheless, it is clear that the two friends frequently discussed art and artists. In a letter to Lowell, Bishop mentioned that she had "always shown her [Miller] everything I write, since we were in college" (December 31, 1948, Robert Lowell Papers, bMSAm1905, Houghton Library, Harvard University). </p>

<p id="lead">"Authenticity" picks up meanings that range from originality to legitimacy, from a sense of generative or instigating force to a quality of genuineness. With those associations, we agreed in the seminar, the term reveals its usefulness, arguably its necessity, to the discourses and polemics that attend the development of any new group, especially a group putatively identified with "making it new." Even if the "authentic" cannot be attached as a value to any one aesthetic object or property, it became clear in our conversations that the concept of the "authentic" has functioned irresistibly—sometimes naïvely, sometimes preemptively, sometimes ironically—in a good deal of the writings associated with modernism. </p>

<p>I'd like to turn this consideration toward an inquiry into the relation between the "authentic" (so claimed) in modernism and a sense of <i>time</i>. It became clear from our discussion that the modernist claim on the New was bound up inextricably with its sense of Now. This relation is sometimes one of opposition, where the "authentic" needs to be rescued from the duplications of modern mass culture. No less often, though, there is a synergistic linkage: the quality of the "authentic" or "genuine" or "original" represents the pressure of the "contemporary," it speaks with a feeling for this certain "moment," it registers one special "period" with some accountability to the standard of the reliable witness. A timely representation of the modern: this is the understanding of the identity and importance of modernism that most of us try to implement as teachers and scholars.  </p>

<p>A number of us try accordingly to frame the time of modernism. In the work I've done over the last twenty years, for 

<b></b>

 representative instance, I can see a trajectory, really a motive design, that has been leading me back to something like a moment of historical origin. This work goes in historical reverse, beginning with the two <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography</i> volumes I edited on then (1984–85) contemporary British and Irish poets, which led to a book on the contemporary British poet Geoffrey Hill, which tried to establish a context for this work in later modernist, or neo-modernist, poetics; then a book on Pound and Lewis and the politics of their aesthetics, which concentrated mainly on the late 1920s and early 1930s; then a book on the major work of 1922, Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>; then a long stretch of work on the literary and political culture of the Great War of 1914–1918, which resulted in a book on that event as a shaping occasion of the work of Woolf, Eliot, Pound, Stein, and Ford, and a Cambridge Companion I edited on the literature of the war. Currently I'm working on a book that takes modernism back into the 1890s, a study more or less of modernism and decadence. If I keep going like this, eventually I'll be working on modernism and Stonehenge. </p>

<p>Even if we understand "origin" as just the farthest horizon we can see, not an originating site, we seem to be reaching toward an historical point at which we can know (what we call) "modernism" as a unique or definite thing, as something different from what had gone before. And while the watershed fallacy is something we expose week by week in teaching a survey course, where we have to invent a crisis or shake-up to expedite our consideration of the "unique intensity" of every period or micro-period, I think it can be fairly said that the major modernist writers of the 1910s and 1920s were animated powerfully by this sense of <i>difference</i> between their own moment and what had gone before, taking "what had gone before" as representative of traditions and conventions which various modernists for various reasons wished to overthrow or reorient. If "modern" derives etymologically from <i>hodie</i>, "today" or "this day" in Latin, then modern<i>ism</i>, as the "ism" of "today" (my spell-check keeps trying to turn "todayism" into "toadyism"), is a feeling that involves a sense of the special present, a radical Now, some imaginative understanding of <i>this moment</i> being unlike the preceding one, or indeed any other. How to be the valid—authentic—witness to this condition? A negotiation for this quality of timely authenticity is undertaken in a revealing way at a particular moment in the history of high modernism. I'd like to frame an analysis of this episode with a more wide-ranging consideration of an identifiably modernist experience—and construction—of time. </p>

<p>A special time consciousness haunts modernism in the form of a preoccupation with the unique interval of the decade, first the 1910s, then the 1920s. The most conspicuous and now controversial sign of this preoccupation has been that often quoted and randomly floating signifier "The Men of 1914," which centered the decade in the moment coinciding with the outbreak of the war and took that watershed event as the marker of a special time consciousness that is owned preemptively by males. Now, a good deal of scholarly work has been undertaken in the last twenty-five years or so to revise our understanding of the chronology of modernism and to expand its census of representative members, including a good number of women writers previously unacknowledged or underappreciated. Raymond Williams among others has encouraged 

<b></b>

 us to see how arbitrary and tendentious has been the effort in the academic study of modernism to limit its representatives to the pyrotechnical poetics of res like Pound and Eliot, Yeats and Joyce, taking these artists as though spontaneously born in the decades they claim as their sites of originating "authenticity." Williams, substituting in his own way a "gradualist" for a "catastrophist" model of cultural history, argues that the major formal innovations of the period could not have occurred without the lessons and models of a realism and naturalism extending well back into the nineteenth century; once this background and resource is acknowledged, a far broader array of literary attitudes and practices may be brought helpfully under the heading of "modernism."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Marianne DeKoven extends this sensibility in questioning a closely focused periodization as a category of understanding and analysis of modernism, demonstrating alternate and complementary points of origin, if you like, "authenticating sites," in a number of female writers—Gilman, Stein, Chopin—that establish the charter documents of modernism in a trans-decade, trans-Atlantic and bi-gendered poetics.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The long view of literary history that these critics enjoy of course allows for inclusions and continuities in the record that the original protagonists might be expected not to see, even to overlook, in their struggle for self-definition in the close confines of the moment, where attitudes that appear to us now as variations on a single theme might appear to them as divergences and exceptions. And so, in our understanding of the artists' ambition to claim a "special-time consciousness" as the authenticating condition of their group sensibility, it is worth looking back to the decades in which "the decade" served the purposes of these early twentieth-century time keepers of modernism, acknowledging the ten-year measure as arbitrary but the need as legitimate. </p>

<p>The decade is a bracketing unit, and the sense of a parenthesis, of time contained and defined as special and so limited but also overshadowed and even fated by its imminent end, starts to characterize the historical feeling and the feeling of history in the world of Anglo-America between the wars. This time consciousness is fostered in some significant part by the presentiment in the 1920s that Europe wasn't really done with war, that it was only waiting between wars (this foreboding shows across the spectrum of modernist authors, from Virginia Woolf to David Jones to Wyndham Lewis, to take the widest variety of sensibility possible). At such moments of high tension, this sense of time-in-crisis, of history coming to critical mass, reverts to the "last days" mythology that Frank Kermode identifies in the apocalyptic subcultures of medieval Christendom and traces through <i>The Sense of an Ending</i> as the radical template of our experience of time in literary fiction.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  And always this sense of time-in-crisis, of the surcharged Now, imparts to the literature of its moment the aura of the extreme, the special, the new and unduplicated, i.e. the authentic. </p>

<p>It is the decade that seems to provide the frame within which this feeling of the special present can be experienced, so to speak, most authentically. The ten-year period allows at once for locality and expansiveness, being short enough to have a particular feeling attached to it and long enough for this feeling to acquire a form of consciousness, a history and even a memory, when, of course, by the laws of the contemporary, which are also the laws of the authentic, which disallows self-imitation, it is outgrown—even 

<b></b>

 if it is outgrown unwillingly, with resistance. But the use of the decade as the mark of one's own group's special identity was of course anticipated by writers in the British 1890s, a nucleus of authors who were, arguably, the first to think of themselves as a group in terms of a local, delimited moment of history.  </p>

<p>The 1890s marker for these authors is not a retrospective arrangement on the part of twentieth-century cultural historians; the decade was already and first of all the primary frame of identity and unity among res as different otherwise as Beardsley and Beerbohm and Wilde. One of the early scholarly works on the decade (written by a near contemporary), Holbrook Jackson's <i>The Eighteen Nineties</i> , documents the time consciousness, the period-feeling, in the major players' representation of themselves individually and as a group.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  This group feeling was fostered in one especially forceful way by the assignably "tragic" quality of the artists of this generation—the early deaths, the premature demises, have the power of abrupt finales and so provide a way (in historical retrospect) of sealing the period off; there seems to have been no "petering out" of that fated decade.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Yet this is also a powerfully present sentiment for the players in the 1890s. Living in the last decade of the last century before the last century of the millennium, these authors were dominated powerfully by this sense of an ending; this feeling was echoed and reinforced in Britain with the re of the aging, long-dying queen, muse and icon for the aging, long-dying empire. Coming into their first maturity in the moment when history is winding down: here is the counter-rhythm special to this decade and generation. This paradox, this conceit of growing up already and quickly dying, becomes the wit and darkening jest of this decade's brief generation. Already in 1896, in his preposterously posthumously titled <i>The Works of Max Beerbohm</i>, the author, then 24 years old, signs off on the last page of the volume, in his aptly titled "Diminuendo." Citing the short but florid history of <i>The Yellow Book</i>, modeling his artistic character on the febrile exhaustion of his friend Beardsley, the emergent author retreats from literature at the very height of his first trajectory—on this last page of his first book: "Once . . . I wrote a little for a Yellow Quarterly and had that <i>succes de fiasco </i>which is always given to young writers of talent. But the stress of creation soon overwhelmed me. . . . I shall write no more. Already I feel myself a trifle outmoded. I belong to the Beardsley period."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>If the fellow travelers in the unique and original moment of modernism are going to find a set of companion talents, then, it is in the 1890s cenacle. But, if they're claiming to be unique and original, they might well be inclined to push away such affiliation, both as a threat to their own originality and as a reminder of the transient character of any work that claims its own time as its authorizing basis—to push it away, that is, as a memento mori. There are other points of contact and resistance, especially in a male modernism typified by Eliot and Pound, who, as Cassandra Laity has pointed out, differ significantly and revealingly from res of female modernism such as H. D. In Laity's analysis, the feminine sensibility typified by H. D. extends and refines the trends of female narcissism, androgyny, homoeroticism and gender-role reversal that had entered the literary imagination through a pan-European decadence and that survived well into the English 1890s, most particularly in Swinburne; whereas a 

<b></b>

 masculinist modernism opposes these proclivities in ways that suggest their underlying anxieties about gender identity and sexual orientation.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The "effeminacy" typified so conspicuously in Wilde offers the most sharply marked target for these concerns, which, of course, emerge as concerns mainly or only because of an affinity that is intimated already and beforehand (these concerns certainly emerged without Pound becoming a public moralist of any conventional stripe and long before Eliot ascended the altar of Anglo-Catholicism). Gender identity provides just one center of attention in which the resemblance of the later decade's sensibility to the earlier one is confirmed even—or especially—in being contested. </p>

<p>I offer the modernists' relationship to the 1890s, or, rather, the modernists' negotiation of their relationship to that earlier decade, as one of the most interesting and revealing locales in the process and struggle of modernist identity formation. It is a likeness at once claimed and disclaimed; the identification is occasionally affirmed directly but more often, and more revealingly, affirmed when it is resisted. Some of the modernists obviously live out the span of the literary history and so embody the problematic of generational identity: Yeats, for primary instance. Eliot, to put the problematic in another way, produces a fascinatingly contradictory record of his own relation to the earlier decade. In "Tradition and the Practice of Poetry<i>" </i>, he maintains that there was no sufficient critical mass of 1890s verse in the first years of the century to influence him in any significant or measurable way. Similarly, in the mid-1920s he writes a letter to Pound disclaiming any formative connection between his verse and that of Swinburne, a poet of <i>decade</i>nce who reverts ever to membership in the 1890s <i>decade</i> (these emphases point up the stuff, not of etymological connection, since the two roots have the different meanings of "fall" and "ten," but of the verbal play that Eliot and Pound both make of the sound-alike formations, clearly linking the two references). Nonetheless, he writes two essays on the work of Swinburne, which are passionate in their discriminations, and he returns elliptically but insistently to the poetry of John Davidson, Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson, Arthur Symons, and Yeats to some degree, as the poets first doing in England the specific sort of thing he (and Pound) would later be trying to do.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Yet the poet whose self-assigned role as exemplar and chronicler of his own brand of modernism is the one who provides the most revealing record of this negotiation—Pound. </p>

<p>Consider the first number of the <i>Egoist</i>, 1 January 1914. Pound has just wrested control of the magazine (formerly the <i>New Freewoman</i>) from Dora Marsden and is using it to introduce to literary London the upstart but already institutionalized energy of his group. This is a moment that reads now, and then, as a prime time of the new movement's "authenticity." If the term suggests in this context both originality or firstness and a legitimate and so recognized and even established character, Pound's claim on these qualities is obviously complicated by the prior history of the 1890s group—at once the model and the nemesis of his own generation's "unique" identity. And so the somewhat strenuous exertions as he devises this parallel manqué in the lead editorial. Here Pound elaborates this contrast between his group and the young men of the earlier decade: 
<b></b></p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"A generation came down to London resolved to speak as they wrote." For all that disastrous decade men spoke with the balanced sentence. There was great awe in the world.</p>
<p>And then there came to London a generation that tries to write as it speaks—and these young men are termed petulant—a praise by faint condemnation?<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The echoing is designed obviously to intensify the sense of difference within the similarity between the 1890s and the 1910s. This difference is more willed and rhetorical than substantial or imaginative, however. Especially revealing here is the taunt Pound uses, ostensibly to assert the convention-dismaying freshness of his generation, as he contrasts their (supposed) poetics of live speech with the (reputed) artifice of the English fin de siècle: "And in the face of this are we in the heat of our declining youth expected to stretch the one word <i>merde </i>over eighteen elaborate paragraphs?" ("FP," 9–10). If this sounds like the rutting season of a young modernism sowing its vocal oats, celebrating its original "voice," it is necessary to note that Pound's fellow revelers are in fact cavorting in "the heat of our <i>declining youth.</i>" They are conforming to the model laid down by 1890s writers, who used the re of the brief candle, of an autumnal dawn, of an early but brief excellence already consumed in the moment of its first flush, as their own signature image. </p>

<p>Pound's echoing suggests a somewhat incriminating inconsistency. His originality is in fact derivative; the resemblance reveals the underlying connection and indebtedness to the 1890s. This connection, however, suggests to me something more than, or different from, inconsistency. I think it bespeaks instead an enabling, indeed a strengthening, paradox. Consider the following complication, from the same piece: "We have attained to a weariness more highly energised than the weariness of the glorious nineties, or at least more obviously volcanic" (ibid.). This re of a <i>more</i> highly energized weariness represents not just a super conceit; it encodes a desire in Pound and for his companion talents to surpass the conceit—it is as though, by stepping up the energy level, he could outrun the riddle, or outdo the oppositional logic of that paradox, and claim just the vital, "volcanic" side. That is his motive meaning, I think. Yet the very 1890s curve on the sentence holds his sense to its own elegant antithesis: it is the weariness itself that is energized, intensified, not done away with; this is the old fin de siècle paradox, affirmed and strengthened even as it is fought against. Inscribing the struggle for difference within similarity, even an admitted similarity, Pound expresses, wittingly or not, the pathos of this campaign for the individual voice, the new and unique personality, the original, the authentic. </p>

<p>Even if there is no such thing as "first," even if Roland Barthes's sardonic testimony to derivativeness, "We are a quotation," is true as well as eloquent, we may ask how the special terms of the 1890s identity hover over and haunt the campaign Pound waged for the singularity or "authenticity" of his generation. Not just as the adjacent or proximate generation, the decade of the 1890s may offer the time-determined character of its identity as a special condition of its "authenticity," and, by repercussion, of an especially modernist "authenticity." This doom of youth may be written as the birthright, or, if you like, the birth-wrong, that Pound is ever contesting and always 

<b></b>

 affirming in his embattled exchange between his decade and the earlier one. And of course the re of the "volcano" anticipates the advent of <i>Blast</i>, the journal of London modernism in its nascent day, a birth that is virtually simultaneous, however, with its demise. A movement that takes its own moment as its establishing, empowering occasion—the special present, as enshrined in the metric of the decade; the radical Now, as intensifying as it is—may be inscribed with the impermanence that is its very condition of existence. There are of course other factors to be taken into account in addressing this quality of "authenticity," but, among a number of modernists' claims to this quality, the time-element may go to some of the fundamental issues and problems, which are revealing as stress points in the ongoing project of self-definition. And so we may ask: is there something overshadowed and fated, something irresistibly temporary, about the "authenticity" of a specifically modernist product, given the temporality, the timeliness, of its specifying identity?  </p>

<p id="lead">Authenticity is a special concern of modernity and a defining feature of modernism, but our seminar discussion revealed several distinct approaches to the relationship of modernism and authenticity. Roger Rothman, citing Georg Simmel, traces the modernist concern with authenticity to a fear of deception engendered by urban experience; Salvador Dalí, says Rothman, represents the position that only by embracing deception can this fear be put to rest. John Paul Riquelme takes a different stance, treating authenticity as an epistemological problem for twentieth-century writers and describing a solution a number of them achieved. They move, he argues, from a discovery of the inauthentic to an evocation of an alternative authenticity, and then finally to a "self-correcting" stance that recognizes that no authenticity is absolute. In a third perspective, Jane Kuenz observes that the writers of the Harlem Renaissance, like other modernists, saw themselves as rescuing authentic literature from mass culture. My contribution to this debate represents a fourth approach, assuming that authenticity is an indispensable value but one that is historically and culturally relative. Authenticity became an acute problem in modernity because many features of traditional social life seemed endangered, especially by the proliferation of media representations. Rock stardom is a telling instance of the persistence of authenticity in the face of these developments. Stardom, itself a distinctive feature of modernity, is to some the very emblem of its inauthenticity. But the film or rock audience's experience of stardom is not one characterized by Dalí's embrace of deception. Authenticity continues to be sought and found, even though it cannot exist in the simple congruence 

<b></b>

 of star image and actual person. Rather, the authenticity of the star inheres primarily in the star image or persona, and not in its relation to the biographical subject who inhabits that image. This conception of authenticity entails not the embrace of surfaces but the location of depth in culture rather than in personality. </p>

<p>It may seem a paradox that the problem of authenticity is a defining feature of modernism, despite the fact that modernism, with its penchant for formal experimentation, has often seemed to revel in the wholesale disappearance of the old, as Vincent Sherry observes in his account of Ezra Pound's sweeping claims for the newness of his generation of poets. But if this kind of radical change in the arts mirrored modernity, when "all that is solid melts into air," individuals and cultures began to preserve what was left of the old and invent traditions that give the impression of solidity.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Historic "preservation" became a special cultural task only in the nineteenth century, when as Eric Hobsbawm and others have shown, traditions first were invented.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  For instance, it was between 1870 and 1905 that the "folk museum" originated in Scandinavia to preserve the authentic artifacts of a more "authentic" way of life then disappearing.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  One could argue that these museums, which put the experience of an archaic way of life in the midst of modernity, were a perfect counterpart to modernist literature, which combined modern formal innovation with archaic references that authenticated this writing in various ways. Pound and Eliot both found authenticity in the cultures that philology had only recently begun to unpack. Yeats, as John Paul Riquelme points out, found it in Celtic mythology, Joyce in ancient Greek myths, and Lawrence in a conception of life before or without civilization. In the U.S., Faulkner found authenticity in the Old South and Hemingway in reducing life and narrative to their bare essentials. </p>

<p>Lionel Trilling explains how "authenticity" functioned in much modernist discourse: "A very considerable originative power had once been claimed for sincerity, but nothing to match the marvelous generative force that our modern judgment assigns to authenticity, which implies the downward movement through all cultural superstructures to some place where movement ends, and begins."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Trilling here is speaking mainly of the moral authority of the self, but we can find a similar pattern in judgments of authenticity applied to cultural artifacts. Trilling's "originative power" should remind us of Michel Foucault's characterization of the modern episteme, with its search for meaning in deep time (philology, biology), and what he calls its philosophical double of the retreat and return of the origin.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  For Trilling, the application of "authenticity" to "human experience" derives from "the museum, where persons expert in such matters test whether objects of art are what they appear to be or are claimed to be, and therefore are worth the price that is asked for them—or . . . worth the admiration they are being given."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Trilling may well have been thinking about Walter Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" when he wrote those lines.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  One does not have to think very hard, however, to realize that Benjamin's prediction of the withering away of art's aura was either entirely mistaken or very premature.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Museums and auction houses continue to trade on the authenticity of the object, and have done very well for themselves on that basis. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the public at large 

<b></b>

 (and art lovers in particular) still regards the criterion of "originality" in Benjamin's sense as highly significant.  </p>

<p>But Benjamin's idea that mechanically reproduced art lacks a significant element of the authenticity of a great painting is certainly correct. A sound recording has no meaningful original, especially a sound recording built on the accretion of different tracks rather than taken from a "live" performance. Moreover, unlike a painting, which is a work of handicraft, recordings are industrially produced goods. The profit from them goes not entirely—and often, not even mainly—to the musicians recorded, but to the corporations to whom the performers in effect sell their labor. Since rock stars are also products of this industry, both are tainted by the inauthenticity associated with commodities. For some like Theodor Adorno, the products of the culture industry are inherently inauthentic.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  While those who value rock &amp; roll can't take such a sweeping position, rock critic Simon Frith articulates a version of it when he opposes popularity and authenticity: "those piles of Springsteen boxes . . . seem less a tribute to rock authenticity than to corporate might."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  We should recognize this as an example of what for Bourdieu defines the field of art, the opposition of the economic and the aesthetic.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This "loser wins" mentality defines authenticity against economic success, and it has been central to modernist aesthetics and to the way rock critics and fans have thought about the value of the music.  </p>

<p>Of course, it is not enough to be unpopular, and so other grounds for authenticity are needed. One of the simplest is whether the musicians are capable of actually performing the music as it was recorded. Live performance thus becomes a testament to the star's authenticity, or, in rare cases, such as that of Milli Vanilli, proof of inauthenticity. Moreover, authenticity on record is associated with audible markers of live performance even when, as is usual, the music on the record was not recorded live even in the studio. This suggests that rock authenticity lies not in the fidelity of the recording to a Benjaminian original, but in what the recording represents. This makes perfect sense when we realize that we don't judge the authenticity of painting by its fidelity to the model or landscape from which the artist drew his or her inspiration.  </p>

<p>Curiously, what rock recordings represent is often something like a provenance functioning, as Trilling described modern authenticity in general, as a "downward movement through all cultural superstructures to some place where movement ends, and begins." A genealogy of rock authenticity would look at jazz, folk, and pop music as the determining elements of its family tree. What has historically been deemed authentic in rock is associated with the primitive, the rustic, the rough, and the wild. The oppositions entailed in these terms first appear in the 1920s when some listeners preferred the authenticity of African American jazz performers like Louis Armstrong over the more polished, traditionally orchestrated music of people like Paul Whiteman. As jazz became increasingly commercial in the big band era, the search for authenticity turned to folk music. Benjamin Filene overstates the case when he asserts that folksong collectors John and Alan Lomax created the "cult of authenticity," but only because that cult produced them as well. And Filene is correct to observe that  <b></b></p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>

 In a pioneering move, the Lomaxes began to promote not just the songs they gathered but also the singers who sang them. In doing so they produced a web of criteria for determining what a "true" folk singer looked and sounded like and a set of assumptions about the importance of <i>being</i> a "true" folk singer.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">When the Lomaxes "discovered" a folk singer, that person was by definition the antithesis of a star and derived his or her authenticity from a presumed identity with the folk. Authenticity in rock &amp; roll is more complicated because it, in contradistinction to folk music, is defined by the institution of stardom. Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and a few other early performers created the practice willy-nilly that others later adopted and adapted, so that, in one sense, there was no rock &amp; roll before there were rock stars. In another sense, one can say that the full-blown phenomenon of rock stardom did not develop until the Beatles and Rolling Stones were able to use Elvis's example as a conception of a career path. Their managers, Brian Epstein and Andrew Oldham, strategically developed the performers' personae just as Hollywood had long done with its stars. As these examples attest, stardom is created out of the interrelation of different media. A publicity apparatus is constructed to ensure that the personality portrayed in the movies or on records is further developed in other media and that images of the stars' offstage lives continue the fans' relationship with them between product releases.  </p>

<p>With stardom comes a new question of authenticity: is the star the person he or she appears to be on screen or on stage? The answer must always in the strict sense be "no" because to be a star is to be presented to the public packaged and mediated. The audience knows this at some level, and yet the desire to know the authentic individual persists. As David Marshall has argued, "the relationship that the audience builds with the film celebrity is conred through a tension between the possibility and impossibility of knowing the authentic individual."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  This ambiguity is not restricted to the phenomenon of stardom or celebrity. All of us exhibit personalities that conceal part of who we are, and, consequently, we are always in a position to wonder about the authenticity of another's personality. Part of the modern concern with authenticity derives from the shift from the older concept of character, an enduring, essential component of a person, to the notion of personality, which is changeable and often functions as a kind of mask. This is part of that modern condition, identification of which Rothman credits to Simmel, of deception anxiety. And yet, we generally accept the personalities of our friends and acquaintances as authentic, making the importance of authenticity as an issue a distinctive feature of star systems. Stars are performers, and to perform is to step into a role that is not one's self. They may thus seem to be "liars," which, as Riquelme notes, is what Oscar Wilde thought all artists were. </p>

<p>Rock &amp; roll stars—by which I mean a select group of performers who, like movie stars, have had the means, ambition, and imagination to take full advantage of their spot in the limelight—inhabit roles on records, on the concert stage, in music videos, in interviews and documentaries. Thus they are experienced by their audiences as performers, and the question of the authenticity of their roles is therefore part of that 

<b></b>

 audience's experience. The experience, however, differs from that associated with a movie star because the rock star's persona is not typically mediated by a character in a fictional narrative. Moreover, the role that the rock star plays is assumed to be his or her own invention. While rock stars have managers, agents, and record companies who collaborate in the creation of their public images, they are typically much more responsible than are movie stars for crafting the particulars of the role or roles they play.  </p>

<p>The authenticity of stars is also made problematic because film and sound recording seem particularly artificial. Compared to print, cinema and sound recording entail more levels of mediation. These greater degrees of mediation mean that authenticity is more of an issue in the case of more recent forms of mechanical reproduction. Moreover, because these media almost always entail collaborative production, their authenticity is not as easily grounded in the Romantic idea of individual expression that literary study usually takes for granted. As a result, authenticity has been a particular problem because of the conditions under which rock is practiced. But this does not explain what Keir Keightley observes, that "authenticity emerged as the over-arching value that brought a unity to rock's various notions of seriousness."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The importance of authenticity to rock has meant that the gaps between persona and person and between original and copy have haunted rock (as they haunt modernism more generally) as a cultural practice.  </p>

<p>But this is only part of the story. The greatest stars continue to personify authenticity—at least to their fans—in the face of almost any changes or revelations that might call it into question. Elvis Presley remained authentically the King to numerous fans even after his personal appearance might seem to have become self-parody. Indeed, even the most radical of all changes, death, did not diminish conviction, for many, in Elvis's real presence. The Rolling Stones continue to fill stadiums by playing the rebellious adolescents they have not been for more than thirty years. This suggests a qualification of Marshall's point. While the very condition of stardom does create the division between the star and the individual, not every fan experiences this division.  </p>

<p>Rock stars have consciously adopted different stances toward authenticity. There are those like David Bowie who take Oscar Wilde's position, that "the first duty in life is to be as artificial as possible" and do not assert the authenticity of their performances.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Others actively assert their authenticity: Bruce Springsteen might be the paradigm here, and he has been described in contradistinction to performers like Bowie as a rock "naturalist" who claims to be "the real thing."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Finally, there are a few performers, most notably Bob Dylan, but also Mick Jagger and Madonna, who seem to claim both artificiality and authenticity. Where Bowie has explicitly played "characters," Dylan has repeatedly refashioned himself, always giving the impression that the new Dylan is at least <i>an</i> authentic Dylan. These stances have produced conflicts among rock critics. Simon Frith and Jon Savage, for example, have asserted a British national tendency toward artifice and have championed Bowie, Brian Ferry, and others who flaunt their artificiality. <sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Dave Marsh and Greil Marcus, on the contrary, tout the value of the authenticity they find in Springsteen or Elvis Presley.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  It is not my intention to take 

<b></b>

 sides in an aesthetic debate about what kind of persona is most appealing. However, I do want to question the way the opposition has been posed.  </p>

<p>Authenticity and artificiality have been treated as opposing terms at least since Wilde's era, and both Trilling and Frith take this opposition for granted. The latter asserts "authenticity must be defined against artifice; the terms only make sense in opposition to each other."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Yet "authentic" need not be an antonym of "artificial," the proper opposite of which is "natural." The natural is sometimes claimed by rock &amp; roll and it is sometimes asserted to be authentic, but neither of these claims is necessary. Since art is always literally artificial, works can never be authentic if that opposition is essential. Indeed, one could claim that it is only within the realm of the artificial that the category of the authentic has any meaning.  </p>

<p>As antifoundationalists, many of us no longer believe in the quest for origins, in Trilling's "downward movement." Trilling himself is at least somewhat skeptical of this conception of authenticity, since he historicizes it and observes its excesses and contradictions. But if we cannot accept the idea of an absolute authenticity that can guarantee the value of art, neither can we do without the criterion of authenticity, which, as Keightley has rightly asserted, "has, in fact, been a core value of Western society for centuries."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  We cannot dispense with distinctions between the authentic and the fraud, even if we are unable always to know how to make them.  </p>

<p id="lead">Because the work of art can never coincide with its subject, because it is always belated with respect to what it represents, any attempt to determine its authenticity as a function of its adequacy to its subject will fail. As several of the papers in this cluster of essays suggest, the question of authenticity must therefore be addressed on different grounds—variously described here in terms of "a kind of authenticity grounded in the fake" (Lynes), of a claim that it is "only within the realm of the artificial that the category of the authentic has any meaning" (Shumway), of paintings whose meaning resides in their non-referentiality (Rothman), of what Wilde calls "the truth of masks" (Riquelme). The poem, painting, or musical performance becomes authentic at the moment that it is adequate to its own nonmimetic nature, at the moment it owns up to its inauthenticity.  </p>

<p>But what does it mean to be authentically inauthentic, to be a real counterfeit? If modernism entails the imperative to convey something whose significance lies in what Baudelaire calls "sa qualité essentielle de présent," then modernism confronts the question of authenticity with particular clarity. The modern is defined fundamentally in opposition to the past, that is, as that which distinguishes what is modern from what precedes it.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The attempt to convey the particularity of the modern, its very presentness, is then bound to fail, for the act of representation itself relegates the present to the past and can at best appear as a repetition of a lost present.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Modernism thus emerges, as Vincent Sherry reminds us in his seminar contribution, as a series of radical Nows, a tradition of the new, in which authenticity is 

<b></b>

  associated not with efforts to keep the present present, but rather with transience itself. The authentic is defined by its own destruction. </p>

<p>It is perhaps not surprising, then, that Walter Benjamin finds one of the earliest theorizations of modernist aesthetics in images of suicide in Baudelaire's writing, namely in the essay "On the Heroism of Modern Life" from the <i>Salon of 1846</i>. Baudelaire's references to suicide follow a series of claims that announce the advent of modernism. "It is true that the great tradition is lost, and the new tradition has not yet been created . . . . Absolute eternal beauty does not exist, or at best is a mere abstraction drawn superficially from the surface of several kinds of beauty. The element of particularity of each form of beauty comes from the passions, and just as we have our particular passions, so we have our beauty."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Modernity, then, spells the end of an ideal of timelessness. Modern beauty, the beauty that modernist art seeks to convey, inheres in the particularity of the moment; whatever seems to transcend or survive the moment is nothing but an illusion, an abstraction. To illustrate his argument, Baudelaire turns to images of suicide: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Except for Hercules on Mount Oeta, Cato of Utica, and Cleopatra, whose suicides are not <i>modern</i> suicides, what other suicides do you see in classical painting? In all the lives of antiquity . . . you will not find the suicide of Jean-Jacques, or even the strange and marvelous suicide of Raphaël de Valentin

[the protagonist of Balzac's <i>La peau de chagrin</i>].</p>

<p class="continued">In a footnote, Baudelaire explains these examples: "The first kills himself because the burning of his robe becomes intolerable; the second because he can no longer aid the cause of liberty; and that voluptuous queen because she has lost her throne and her lover; but none of them destroys themselves in order to change their skin in view of metempsychosis" (<i>OC</i>, 2:494). Hercules, Cato, and Cleopatra die, that is, in order to preserve and perpetuate their own self-images. In these deaths, self-determination and fate, action and reaction, converge such that how they are interpreted cannot but coincide with their intentions. Thus while particular renderings of the deaths of these ancient heroes may appear superficially different, every image of the classical suicide demonstrates the perfect correspondence of image and manner of death. Classical suicide affirms the validity of an idealized image, and as such becomes the very image of classicism. Against such classical idealization, modern suicide marks a radical transformation. Committed "in view of metempsychosis," that is, of a transmigration of the soul whose destination is undetermined, it breaks with the past of the self and commits itself to a radically unknown and unknowable future. As such, modern suicide is not available to the artist as a mere subject of representation or emblem of modern life. Rather than give adequate form to an idea or era, modern suicide appears as a disruption. It takes place in the gap between what was and what has yet to be. One 

<b></b>

 who commits modern suicide acts not in order to confirm an existing identity but in order to become an unpredictable other. The question of whether his action affirms or denies an authentic intention or self-image becomes moot. This disruption identifies the modern suicide with modernism more generally, to the extent that modernism dwells in what Baudelaire identifies as the break between the "grand tradition" and the as-yet-unestablished new one. Modern suicide provides the very image of modernism.  </p>

<p>What does it mean for the artist to seek what is authentic in his art in an image of suicide? Whereas modern suicide in Baudelaire's text opposes the "mere abstraction" of timelessness, associated with a defunct classicism, Benjamin locates the force of modern suicide in its resistance to modern life itself: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The resistance which modernity offers to the natural productive élan of a person is out of proportion to his strength. It is understandable if a person grows tired and takes refuge in death. Modernity must appear under the sign of suicide, the seal of which is affixed beneath a heroic will that makes no concessions to a mentality hostile to it. This suicide is not a resignation but a heroic passion.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Modernity (<i>die Moderne</i>) colonizes the person and her specific life force and assimilates her to an abstraction, to a world of perpetual alienation.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Suicide in this light appears as a mere reaction to modernity's overwhelming power, the sign of its complete victory. It becomes a symptom, a cry for help to which the only appropriate response is to seek to prevent suicide (politically, medically, etc.). Understood as a symptom, however, suicide appears fundamentally as a mistake, in that it cannot achieve its own aims, such that the effort to prevent suicide itself becomes complicit with modernity's victory over individual agency. Modernity is thus imagined as a totalizing force that leaves no space for resistance. </p>

<p>The turn in Benjamin's argument that identifies suicide as "not a resignation but a heroic passion" suggests, on the other hand, that the sign of suicide may not merely ratify modern alienation, but may instead provide access to an experience or reality situated on the very threshold of modernity. The "seal" of suicide indicates the vantage point from which the difference between the modern and something external to the modern could be witnessed and where therefore the specificity of the modern, which is otherwise erased by modernity's abstracting power, could be grasped. To be fully modern, in this analysis, is to be dead. Suicide thus reveals the specificity of modernity to the modern artist—or more radically put, it makes modern art possible—because it creates the death that is modernity and does not merely succumb to it as something already accomplished.  </p>

<p>The complex alliance between the artist and the suicide suggested by the image of the seal does not survive Benjamin's subsequent efforts to identify concrete instances of modern suicide. In place of Baudelaire's admittedly strange examples, which Benjamin

<b></b>

  calls "meager," he substitutes res such as a Parisian printer who committed suicide in the wake of a failed attempt to organize a labor union, an Englishman who committed suicide out of financial despair and whose death became the subject of a popular lithograph, and another worker who hanged himself on Eugène Sue's doorstep.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  "Someone like Baudelaire," he speculates, "could very well have viewed suicide as the only heroic act that remained for the <i>multitudes maladives</i> of the cities in reactionary times" (<i>CB</i>, 82). What makes modern suicide modern is not the form it assumes but instead the social and political identity of those who commit suicide. But this recourse to social history severs the bond between modern suicide and the image of the artist implied by Baudelaire's references to his literary precursors Balzac and Rousseau (who was still in the mid-nineteenth century rumored to have taken his own life). An exploration of Baudelaire's particular examples is not possible here; they are not "meager" but extremely rich.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  I therefore instead turn for illustration to a short text by Baudelaire that develops this connection between suicide and modernism. </p>



<div class="sec-break">

<p>Baudelaire's "The Rope," a prose poem dedicated to Eduoard Manet and based on an event in Manet's life,<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  begins with a description of a world permeated by inauthenticity. Structured as a tale told by a painter to an anonymous friend, the poem describes a series of events that destroy the painter's faith in the adequacy of appearances to meaning and therefore in the existence of absolute and eternal truths. After a young boy whom he has employed as a model and servant kills himself in the painter's studio, the boy's mother begs the painter to give her the rope her son used to hang himself. Upon receiving a number of similar requests, the painter comes to suspect the mother of commercial motives. In one variant of the text, the friend, who is otherwise a silent auditor, concludes the story with a calculation of how much she stood to gain: "one meter of hangman's rope [corde de pendu] at one hundred francs per ten centimeters . . . that makes one thousand francs, or one <i>réel</i>, an effective consolation for that poor mother" (<i>OC</i>, 1:1339). The painter once thought of maternal love as the very cornerstone and guarantee of reality: "If there exists a single self-evident, simple, never-changing phenomenon . . . it is maternal love" (<i>OC</i>, 1:328). Now even this seeming absolute erodes, as the mother is suspected of exchanging the reality of her son's death for a <i>réel</i>, for a false, fungible reality.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  A singular event and a singular relationship become generic, interchangeable, inauthentic. </p>

<p>In terms that echo Marx's definition of commodity fetishism as "a definite social relation between men that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things," and that anticipate later characterizations of modernity as a space permeated by deception, as in Roger Rothman's discussion of Simmel and Bergson in his seminar contribution, the painter articulates the overall lesson of his tale in the opening lines of his monologue:<b></b> </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Illusions," my friend told me, "are perhaps as innumerable as the relationships of men among themselves, or between men and things. And when the illusion disappears, that is to say when we see beings or things as they exist outside ourselves, we experience a bizarre feeling, composed half of regret for the vanished phantom, half of pleasant surprise before the new, before the real fact."</p>

	<div class="attrib">
[le fait réel]<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Whereas the mother's alleged complicity in the regime of inauthenticity appears to the painter as symptomatic, he assigns himself a diagnostic intelligence that stands at the threshold of the world of illusions, able to witness the moment when illusion is exposed as such, that is, when the overwhelming inauthenticity of modern life is revealed. Reality, which he once identified with the self-evident and never changing, now appears only at the moment when that very illusion disappears, such that whatever appears to be real—whatever assumes a self-evident and never-changing face—is by definition illusion. Modern reality, then, does not exist as a stable object—when the regret and the surprise wear off, will the "real fact" not be absorbed back into the network of illusions?—but rather as an act, a deed, which is another meaning of <i>fait</i>. The painter's own authenticity—his status as a modern artist and the authenticity of his work, which is the very tale he tells—thus hinges on his ability to transmit the event of the suicide in a way that resists the regime of illusion, in a way that does justice to its eventfulness.  </p>

<p>The painter's possible failure in this enterprise is suggested by the terms in which his relationship to the boy is described. Whereas the painter sees himself as endowed with a faculty of observation that "makes life more living and more meaningful than it is to others," he treated the boy as a generic being, whom he "transformed now into a little bohemian, now into an angel, now into mythological Love," and whom he made wear "the vagabond's violin, the Crown of Thorns and the Nails of the Passion, and Eros's Torch" (<i>OC</i>, 1:329). The objectification of which he accuses the boy's mother replicates—or indeed, may be a projection of—his own treatment of the boy. Although wary of others who fetishize the rope at the expense of acknowledging the humanity of the boy, the painter himself demonstrates, as Christopher Prendergast suggests, an "unambiguous complicity in the reduction of the boy (whether in life or death) to an object of exchange."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  In this light, the boy's suicide resonates with Benjamin's efforts to see suicide as a form of resistance to modern alienation, as a radical form of labor strike.  </p>

<p>The dire alternative suggested by this reading—compliance or death—is complicated, however, as the painter discovers the boy's corpse, whose eyes, "wide open with a terrifying fixity, at first created in me the illusion that he was alive [me causèrent d'abord l'illusion de la vie]" (<i>OC</i>, 1:329). On one level, this image advances the idea of suicide-as-protest by challenging the artist's previous claim to "make life more living." Rather than reveal the meaning of what he sees, this practice here leads the artist into error as he mistakes death for life. But the reversal of the illusion-generating gaze also res the suicide as an appropriation of the means of artistic production. Hanging from a nail in the door of an armoire, in the place where in a painter's studio one might expect a mirror or perhaps a painting, the corpse, in a more literal translation, "caused me [the painter] to become an illusion of life." The corpse's gaze transforms the painter 

<b></b>

 into an image—except that instead of an idealizing gaze that "makes life more living," this gaze sees life as itself an illusion, the mask of death.  </p>

<p>The boy's suicide thus produces a new way of perceiving reality. Reality is now associated not with what is living but what is dead, such that the artist's authority as an artist now inheres in his ability to see through the illusion of life and to perceive his own death. This seems to take place in the following scene, which suggests an image of parturition as the painter cradles the boy's whole body in one arm while with the other he "cuts the cord" (<i>OC</i>, 1:330). Michel Butor has associated the boy in "La corde" with "the budding poet, the poet who has not yet created himself.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  One might add to Butor's suggestion that the lethal cord cutting into the child's neck more specifically suggests an image of stillbirth, in which the painter finds an image of his own dead self, where this death is the necessary condition of artistic authority.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Indeed, this transformation of the dead child into the re of the artist recalls Baudelaire's association of modern suicide with metempsychosis, as if the suicide's soul has effectively transmigrated into the painter's body, allowing the painter to bear intimate and authentic witness to the other's deed. </p>

<p>By the same token, however, the image of stillbirth threatens to become yet another idealization, annulling the specificity of the event of the boy's suicide as it converts this event into a preration of the artist's birth as an artist. As the story of the boy's death finally becomes a form of currency between himself and his friend, a tale to be exchanged, it becomes unclear whether the painter can avoid replicating the sort of commodification of which he and his friend accuse the mother. This reading acquires particular poignancy in light of the fact that Baudelaire normally sold his prose poems by the line.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  "The Rope," like the rope, is something that can be cut into pieces, bought and sold, in a market in which one line is worth as much as any other.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Baudelaire  plays on this idea when he characterizes his collection of prose poems as a whole to his publisher as having "neither head nor tail, because everything in it is, to the contrary, both head and tail at the same time." He continues: "Consider, I beg you, what admirable advantages [<i>commodités</i>] this combination offers to us all: to you, to me, and to the reader. We can cut where we wish, I my daydreams, you the manuscript, the reader his reading" (<i>OC</i>, 1:275). The <i>petits poèmes en prose</i> are "commodités" precisely because they can be "cut." Indeed, the fact that Baudelaire cut part of the poem (the lines quoted above in which the listener calculates the value of the rope) in order to publish it three separate times in two different versions suggests the financial advantages of this method.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  "The Rope" thus does not merely stand outside and comment upon the commodification of reality, but rather has this commodification as its condition of possibility.  </p>

<p>Yet the fact that the poem seemingly renounces the potential financial benefits of including the suppressed paragraph in the final version suggests that it also circulates in another economy, one that does not base a poem's value on its length. The poem is created by the event of this cutting, in and through its own self-mutilation. As such, it is like the boy, who emerges from the deathlike state of objectification through suicide. But if the poem creates itself by cutting itself up for sale, the analogy between the poem 

<b></b>

 and the boy might then suggest a reading of the boy's suicide that the painter never seems to consider, namely that the boy's act could be neither a reaction to the unlivable conditions of modernity nor a protest against the regime of illusions, but instead an act, like the poem, that invites its own commodification, in which the boy creates the rope's value through his suicide just as Baudelaire creates "The Rope"'s value through cutting it. One might even speculate (though this would be pure speculation, an attempt to earn interest without any investment of evidence) that the child commits an act of filial love, that his love returns to the mother the love she gave him, now salvaged from the painter's cynicism, in the troubling form of the gift of the rope. Cutting himself, the <i>fils</i> (son) becomes the <i>fil</i> (thread, cord), which preserves his identity only in the form of the cut. If this is the case, then the modernism of both the suicide and the poem—their status as authentically modern events, events that bear witness to the particularity of the modern—would inhere not in the ways they resist a modernity external to them, nor in the ways they react constitute symptoms to such a modernity. Their modernist authenticity would inhere instead in the dizzying logic of self-destruction, wherein to be authentically modern means to destroy the possibility of being authentic. The sale of the rope—its circulation not only in a marketplace of fetishized commodities but also in a cultural marketplace—would not then destroy something that otherwise would have remained authentic. Instead, it would suggest that authenticity is the price one pays for being modern. The consolation of the rope—and the consolation of modernism—is the confidence they place in the value of the very authenticity they destroy. </p>

<p>By the 1950s, modernism was quickly losing its status as a term denoting a rebellious or even revolutionary grouping of artists. Modernism's little magazines could no longer claim to be the harbingers of the new and unfamiliar, blowing up (<i>Blast</i>) or sweeping out (<i>Broom</i>) the old and irrelevant. In the form of abstract expressionism, it dominated painting; modernist, Bauhaus-influenced design was becoming ubiquitous in consumer products; bebop jazz was at its apex. If Philip Johnson's 1949 Glass House "made Modernism palatable to the country's social elites," 1951's Lever House marked the beginning of the International Style's ubiquity in institutional and commercial architecture.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Modernist hallmarks such as speed, simplicity, and streamlining even filtered into urban planning, as the legacy of Robert Moses still indicates. "Although [in the 1950s] one could always find quotable jabs at Modernism along the extremist fringes of public opinion," Alice Goldfarb Marquis writes in her biography of Museum of Modern Art director Alfred H. Barr, "the great moderate mass among educated Americans had by this time fully embraced the notion of abstract—or virtually any other kind of—art."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> </p>

<p>Modernism as a style or collection of styles had so much become the establishment, in fact, that it was even used to <i>defend</i> 

<b></b>

 the very societies and political systems toward which much modernist art had been, and still was, so relentlessly hostile. In the early 1950s the so-called "free world" in which modernism had gained such ascendancy was powerfully and disturbingly confronted by a social, cultural, political, and military force that insisted it was more modern than the moderns, the advance guard of the avant-garde, the end toward which history was unfolding. The Soviet Union, its satellite states, the revolutionary movements in the developing world, and Marxist ideology in general were, their leaders and adherents insisted, the concrete manifestations of the progress of history, and the "free world" would inevitably fall to their irrefutable logic. In response, the United States and the nations of Western Europe marshaled unprecedented military, economic, and even cultural resources to counter this threatening, competing vision of modernity and the future.  </p>

<p>Modernism itself became a weapon in what has become known as the "Cultural Cold War." In the early 1950s, the most important battlegrounds of <i>this</i> war were the sympathies of influential leftist Western European intellectuals, the vast majority of whom scorned what they saw as the U.S.'s shallow, business-dominated culture and its "Coca-Colonization" of the rest of the world but who were also leery of Stalinist authoritarianism and militarism. To these Europeans, American culture was Mickey Mouse and cowboy movies at best and malevolent military-imperialist power at worst. In response, the United States—primarily through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the United States Information Agency (USIA), and the cultural officers of the State Department—undertook an effort to "increase cultural understanding" between Europe and itself, an effort centered on the construction of an image of the U.S. with an intellectual and cultural life equal to, and in dialogue with, Europe's, an image which the U.S. then aggressively marketed to those skeptical European leftists. Nongovernmental agencies, too, joined the Cultural Cold War, sometimes with official support and funding and sometimes completely independently. The best known of the unofficial groups (largely because of the spectacular revelations of its covert CIA sponsorship) is certainly the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), which brought together American and European noncommunist leftists in symposia, conferences, and several journals, most notably <i>Encounter</i>.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  But as many scholars have shown, there were dozens of other nongovernmental projects dedicated to "increasing cultural understanding" between the U.S. and Europe through such programs as academic exchanges, the distribution of books and films and artworks abroad, and tours by American musicians.  </p>

<p>In many of these projects, it was American <i>modernism </i>in art, literature, music, architecture, and even dance that served as evidence of American cultural advancement—but this was a modernism redefined and made safe for official sponsorship. In the following pages I look at a small, short-lived project that played a key role in redefining modernism as being characterized primarily by style, not by subject matter; in directing modernism away from its often collectivist/Utopian origins and toward bourgeois individualism; in transforming modernism from an avant-garde, oppositional movement to a style that could be comfortably embraced by diverse spheres of elite culture in the U.S.; and in constructing a coalition of elites that accepted and endorsed modernism as America's 

<b></b>

 high culture and that linked, however implicitly, modernism to the mission of the U.S. national-security establishment. And although this project—Intercultural Publications, Incorporated (IP), and its journal <i>Perspectives USA,</i> headed by James Laughlin of New Directions Books and funded by the Ford Foundation—had little quantifiable strategic effect in the Cultural Cold War, it is significant, I believe, in the domestication of literary and artistic modernism. <i>Perspectives</i> depoliticized and aestheticized modernism, contextualizing it as the natural product of free artists exercising free inquiry and free expression in a free society. In the pages of <i>Perspectives</i>, modernism was transformed from an oppositional literary and artistic <i>movement</i> forged by the desire to <i>épater le bourgeois</i> into an artistic and literary <i>style</i> that could be adopted by the power elite of the West—governments, universities, foundations, businesses—and then reflected back at the Europeans who had initially given birth to it. But this was a modernism deracinated from its avant-garde or revolutionary heritage, comfortable with capitalism and establishment power, making a compromise between cutting critique of the bourgeois order and mass (or "middlebrow") culture and its ultimate choice "of the West," as Dwight Macdonald memorably put it. Modernism itself became propaganda for a "Free World" defined by democratic institutions, free-market capitalism, and bourgeois individualism.  </p>

<p>The project was not without contradictions. In its self-presentation, <i>Perspectives USA</i> vigilantly policed what Andreas Huyssen has called the "great divide" between highbrow modernism and mass taste, but this was in the service of a larger argument for the superiority of American egalitarianism and meritocracy.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Like modernism itself, <i>Perspectives</i> maintained its high-modernist withdrawal from the capitalist economy even though it was created and directed by res from the business community and presented an argument for liberal capitalism. Finally, Laughlin's journal implicated modernism—a movement defined in its own pages as the creation of rebel individuals who rejected the commercialized mass taste of dominant society—in a collaboration between intellectuals, universities, foundations, the business world, the publishing industry, and the national-security state. </p>

<p>Underpinning Laughlin's project was his belief in a liberal, individualistic society and his desire to see that society confront and defeat what had become known as "totalitarianism." In this, of course, Laughlin was squarely in the mainstream of American political opinion. The most influential model for what a "liberal society" opposed to totalitarianism might look like was provided by Arthur M. Schlesinger's <i>The Vital Center</i> , which argued forcefully for the "liberal" ideology, identified by Schlesinger as the strain of American political thought that valued free expression, art, and unfettered education, and opposed the domination of the "business class." <i>The Vital Center</i> argues that the Soviet system in particular, and totalitarianism in general, seeks to undermine the individual, thinking, acting subject. "Direct political control," Schlesinger wrote in reference to the Soviet—and Popular Front—desire to determine the content of procommunist writing, "either throttles the serious artist or makes him slick and false."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Art suffers under the phony, predetermined standards of totalitarian expression: "Where direct political control cannot reach, the Communists and their 

<b></b>

 friends have exerted their influence toward lowering and softening artistic standards in a pseudo-democratic direction" (<i>VC</i>, 125–26). Schlesinger particularly stresses how modernist art—"the paintings of Picasso, the music of Stravinsky"—because of their ambiguity and strangeness, can only be appreciated by free individuals. Such works "reflect and incite anxieties which are incompatible with the monolithic character of 'the Soviet person'" (<i>VC</i>, 79). Artists, and writers in particular, are at the center of Schlesinger's exaltation of "radical nerve": </p>

<p>Silone, with his profound moral sensibility; Gide, with his quivering sense of freedom; Koestler, with his probing, insatiable intellectual curiosity; Hemingway, who disliked people who pushed other people around; Reinhold Niebuhr, with his tragic sense of the predicament of man; George Orwell, with his vigorous good sense, his hatred of cant; Edmund Wilson, with his belief in moral and aesthetic taste.</p>

<p class="continued">Providing an illustration of Schlesinger's characterizations of the crippled intellectual and artistic life under "totalitarianism" was the influential anthology <i>The God That Failed: A Confession</i> , a work compiling "confessions" from six former Communist Party members in Europe and the U.S.. The authors—Arthur Koestler, Ignazio Silone, Richard Wright, André Gide, Louis Fischer, and Stephen Spender—contributed personal narratives of their immersion in, and eventual rejection of, the Communist Parties of their respective nations. Spender (who later became an editor of <i>Encounter)</i> bitterly regretted the way that the communists had taken control of the Popular Front anti-fascist movement of the 1930s. In terms that would later appear in <i>Encounter</i>, Spender attacked communist epistemology, in which "experience could only be drawn on in order to illustrate an aspect of a foregone conclusion, arrived at independently of the experience." Marxists even used this methodology in their literary criticism, praising Keats as a victim of capitalism, reading <i>Finnegans Wake</i> as an illustration of "the disintegration of thought and language of the bourgeois individualist world" and congratulating Virginia Woolf for recognizing the "historic necessity" of her suicide.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Independent judgment, even on aesthetic questions, is lost to foregone conclusions; each of the six writers describes the ominous fading of the individual himself under the glare of the Party's imperatives. </p>

<p>Lionel Trilling's collection <i>The Liberal Imagination</i>  also took up the question of the place of modernist or experimental art in a liberal society, but where Schlesinger was sanguine about how this art could coexist happily with liberal democracy, Trilling looked at the actual situation of the times and saw potential contradictions. Modernist art, he perceptively argued, was "indifferent" to "the liberal ideology," which Trilling identified as "a ready if mild suspiciousness of the profit motive, a belief in progress, science, social legislation, planning, and international cooperation."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Liberals—to Trilling the term encompassed most on the left in the 1920s through the 1940s—valued literature that had a social conscience, that examined social and political problems. "Our dominant literature," he complained, "is profitable in the degree that it is earnest, sincere, solemn. At its best it has the charm of a literature of piety. It has neither imagination nor mind." Modernists—"those writers who, by the general consent of the 

<b></b>

 most serious criticism, by consent too of the very class of educated people of which we speak, are to be thought of as the monumental res of our time"—avoided what Trilling saw as the simplistic, politically pliable practices of literary realism, and because of this, the political importance of the best works of the imagination of the time went unrecognized: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Proust, Joyce, Lawrence, Eliot, Yeats, Mann (in his creative work), Kafka, Rilke, Gide—all have their own love of justice and the good life, but in not one of them does it take the form of a love of the ideas and emotions which liberal democracy, as known by our educated class, has declared respectable. So that we can say that no connection exists between our liberal educated class and the best of the literary minds of our time. And this is to say that there is no connection between the political ideas of our time and the deep places of the imagination.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The solution, as Trilling saw it, was the little magazine, specifically <i>Partisan Review</i>. <i>Partisan Review</i> in particular "has devoted itself . . . to organiz[ing] a new union between our political ideas and our imagination." Rather than aiming at mass appeal, the little magazines sought to affect an influential, elite few, and it would be a fallacy, Trilling insisted, to think that a magazine with a circulation of 6,000 cannot be "powerful" (<i>LI</i>, 103). </p>

<p>It will surprise no one familiar with the period that <i>Perspectives USA</i> became yet another forum in which the leftist New York Intellectuals and the largely conservative New Critics joined forces to argue for the vital importance of (often modernist) literature as a bastion of autonomous culture against both middlebrow kitsch and Stalinism, and for the need to evaluate art according to apolitical criteria such as formal complexity, ambiguity, psychological acuity, and rejection of mass taste.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  For these critics, modernism was also characterized by a particular attitude of an individual toward society: the modernist was an alienated rebel, heir to the romantic tradition of the solitary artist doomed to be misunderstood and rejected by a philistine society. From the work of 1940s and 1950s critics such as Spender, Rosenberg, Greenberg, Macdonald, Howe, and many others came the familiar image of the modernist artist as the individualist who creates great art even as society around him decays into the decadence of commercial culture, smug middlebrowism, or totalitarian "groupthink." For these critics, and for philosophers such as Theodor Adorno, modernist art was by definition opposed to mass culture, whether that mass culture was American, Soviet, or Nazi. These theories that dominated the 1940s through the 1960s were also gendered, emphasizing modernism's implacable rejection of (a frequently feminized) mass culture and the heroic individualism of the (almost inevitably male) rebel artist.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  From all of these ideas arises the understanding of high modernism that in large part still persists today, even if only as a straw man: outwardly and explicitly concerned with the process of its own creation, formally complex, erudite, resistant, psychologically sophisticated, apolitical, intellectual rather than emotional, masculine rather than feminine, and (as the <i>Little Review</i> put it) "making no compromise with the public taste."  </p>

<p>In the early 1950s, then, the "serious artist"—the modernist—was one who rejected mass taste, who avoided simplistic realist representation, who mistrusted political messages 

<b></b>

 in art, and whose art investigated the psychological complexities of the individual subject. At its extreme, modernism embraced aestheticism and <i>l'art pour l'art</i>; but even among those modernists and critics (such as the New York Intellectuals) who felt that art had some role to play in society, direct political content conveyed through realist representation was seen to limit the importance and accomplishment of the artwork. This apolitical, even oblique, modernism does not, clearly, seem like a promising propaganda weapon: but its very apoliticality made the "modernism" constructed by Greenberg, Rosenberg, <i>Partisan Review,</i> and the New Critics a key component in an argument about the cultural superiority of the West. </p>

Cold War Modernists

<p>Although Stalinism was increasingly discredited among European leftists by the 1950s (particularly after the Hungarian uprising of 1956), national Communist Parties, especially in Italy and France, remained strong, and many prominent leftist intellectuals and artists—such as Sartre, Picasso, and Léger—sympathized with or belonged to them.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  These intellectuals were attracted by communism's egalitarian and anticolonial stances, but many were also motivated by their opposition to American political, military, and economic power as it was increasingly exercised in Europe. Moreover, many leftist intellectuals also felt and expressed the strong <i>cultural</i> antagonism that precipitated the Cultural Cold War. </p>

<p>As Rob Kroes points out, hostility to American culture among European intellectuals intensified after the First World War, when "a generation of conservative European critics of culture . . . looked toward America with the ominous sense of watching Europe's future . . . . Theirs was an anguished awareness of the erosion of cultural standards ushered in by the age of mass consumption and mass culture."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  This "awareness" persisted into the 1950s, when, increasingly, it was the U.S.'s essential shallowness, caused by its lack of historical consciousness, that Europeans attacked: "Whether they see Americans as cold, efficient, conformist, or unstoppably energetic, they always refer to aspects of a national mentality that is seen as being on the surface, never probing the depths of its innermost stirrings, never rising above the immediate here and now."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In their most damning and persuasive arguments—arguments repeated by the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) after the Second World War—these intellectuals dismissed American culture as commercial, shallow, exploitive, and venal. In this view, modernism's great experiments could never occur in the United States because its culture valued only mass art, popular entertainments, and creative work whose quality was judged by success in the marketplace. American politicians grew concerned about this during the cold war, when even President Eisenhower, whose campaign had derided Adlai Stevenson as an "egghead," worried that Europeans saw Americans as "a race of materialists . . . . Our successes are described in terms of automobiles and not in terms of worthwhile cultural works of any kind. Spiritual and intellectual values are deemed to be almost nonexistent in our country."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The unofficial beginning of the Cultural Cold War is often seen as the crashing of a 1949 Cominform-sponsored conference in New York by "Americans for Intellectual Freedom," an ad hoc group of American intellectuals and artists, many of them former communists, led by Sidney Hook. Seeing an opportunity, the Office of Policy Coordination (an agency created by the National Security Council in 1948 to pursue psychological warfare against the Soviets, and later merged into the CIA) attempted to organize these members of what became known as the "noncommunist left," and after a few unsuccessful forays in 1950 brought these Americans together with those in Europe to create the CCF, an ostensibly independent group in fact funded by the CIA and with CIA operatives in high positions.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The CCF published an influential and popular magazine (<i>Encounter</i>), ran symposia, and sponsored tours of musicians and artworks primarily intended as propaganda for the West, but with a secondary goal of showing Europeans that American art and cultural life was as advanced and accomplished as that of anywhere else in the world. Although the U.S. Department of State undertook many overt programs of cultural diplomacy and propaganda, ranging from lending libraries at American consulates to the Voice of America to sending William Faulkner abroad as a goodwill ambassador, the CCF sought to achieve many of the same goals without alerting audiences to its governmental links.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> </p>

<p>In these efforts, the CCF, USIA, and State Department often spotlighted how American artists and intellectuals were contributing to and even spearheading international modernism. However, not everyone accepts the claim that the CIA uncomplicatedly used modernism as a propaganda tool. Robert Burstow reviews what he calls the "revisionist" scholarship of Eva Cockroft and others, and suggests that history presents "a far more complex situation and a need to rethink existing presumptions about the CIA's aesthetic tastes" and the general attitude toward modernism.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  And beyond the CIA, American public res were even less supportive of modern art. The McCarthy era saw many conservative public res (notably House Committee on Public Works chairman George Dondero) attacking modern art and the MoMA as "instrument[s] of Communist subversion," and MoMA director Barr had to deny in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> that "modern art" was "communistic."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  It wasn't just conservatives, either; President Truman remarked while looking at a "mildly distorted rative painting by Yasuo Kuniyoshi" that "If that's art, I'm a Hottentot," and in 1947 Secretary of State George Marshall forbade spending "taxpayers' money on modern art."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  However, even Jane de Hart Mathews grants that in the end the antimodernists were "outmaneuvered by more sophisticated individuals [such as Barr and MoMA benefactor Nelson Rockefeller] eager to capitalize on the fact that <i>avant-garde</i> art and culture exist only in a society that is liberal-democratic (politically) and bourgeois-capitalist (economically)."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  A depoliticized modernism, identified as "modernist" by virtue of formal and stylistic characteristics (including difficulty), presented as the work of heroic individualists working in a free society, and used as evidence "that American society was so free ideologically that no form was too experimental or abstruse for toleration and even support," was a key component of cold-war era rhetoric.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>In 1952, James Laughlin of New Directions Books was the long-time publisher of American modernists such as Pound and Williams and, since the war ended, he had been also publishing European and Latin American modernists in the U.S., work that won him the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor from the French government. Although Laughlin was largely apolitical throughout his life, he also felt that "totalitarianism" was a threat to the experimental writing and intellectual freedom that he valued so highly, and that modernist art and literature could only be produced in a free society. Moreover, he felt that modernist writers—"word-workers"—could bring about reform through transforming consciousness itself. Early in his career, he wrote that, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The world is in crisis, and language is at once the cause and the cure. New social concepts could stop the waste and the destruction.

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Laughlin also had come to feel, as a result of the Second World War, that the U.S. had a special responsibility to advance freedom—artistic and intellectual freedom—worldwide.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In 1946, Laughlin traveled in devastated Germany on behalf of the State Department and on this trip was struck by the desperation of the German people, and concerned by what he saw as their vulnerability to the specious promises of communism and to the "false idea . . . that America is a nation of 'materialists' and 'barbarians' incapable of spiritual and cultural activity on a high plane."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  To counteract this, Laughlin decided to export culture. In his oral history of Intercultural Publications, Laughlin reminisced that his friend Robert Hutchins, a former president of the University of Chicago and at the time an associate director of the Ford Foundation, had approached him in 1951 about undertaking such a project. "I thought immediately," Laughlin said, "of intercultural exchange through books or through magazines, through the printed word." Because the recently ended war had caused an "almost total blackout of cultural exchange" between Europe and the U.S., </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I suggested to Hutchins and his associates that it might be worthwhile to attempt to put out a magazine of American culture which would be made available in translation in some of the principal languages of Europe and which would be sold, particularly to students and intellectuals, at a subsidized low price and that the successive issues of this magazine would attempt to bring together a panorama of what had been going on in American writing, in American philosophy, in architecture, in art, in music, in the whole cultural spectrum.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup></p>

<p>With an initial $5,000 grant, Laughlin prepared a sample issue of <i>Perspectives USA</i>.

 </p>

<p>It's difficult to imagine just how big the Ford Foundation became when, at the deaths of Edsel Ford in 1943 and Henry Ford in 1947, the Ford family gave 90% of the stock of the privately held Ford Motor Company to the Foundation. Given the governmental assessment of each share's value of $135, the gift was worth $416,880,000, but the real worth on the open market was significantly more. When the Foundation sold 20% of that stock to the public in 1956, the sale brought in $643 million, suggesting that the Foundation had owned $3.2 billion worth of Ford stock. In his 1956 overview<i> The Ford Foundation: The Men and the Millions,</i> Dwight Macdonald notes that the Foundation's assets at that time were "considerably more than half as much money as all the other foundations in the country have among them."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  And Ford spent its money on a scale beyond what the other foundations could imagine: in 1954, it spent four times as much as Rockefeller (the second-largest American foundation at that time), and ten times the amount of Carnegie Corporation (the third-largest). Not only its wealth but its projects were massive: one initiative, for instance, was to increase higher-education faculty salaries in the U.S., and to accomplish this the Foundation divvied up $210 million and distributed a proportional share to every college and university in the nation. </p>

<p>The Foundation's mission, as set forth in its 1950 "Gaither Report," was (and remains) to "strengthen democratic values, reduce poverty and injustice, promote international cooperation, and advance human achievement."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Culture was an avenue by which these goals could be achieved. "The officers," the Foundation noted in the 1951 Annual Report, "regard the exchange of ideas, and possibly also of artistic and literary productions, as one of the most promising methods of fostering the development of World understanding and a sense of the moral and cultural community among the peoples of the world."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In this vision, its mission meshed with the liberal view of America's mission in the world. The Foundation was deeply involved, and invested, in the U.S. project of cultural diplomacy. Nowhere was this involvement more clearly seen than in Europe, where the Foundation, the State Department, and the CIA worked along parallel tracks or even intersected (as with their joint funding of the CCF). In the 1950s, Ford's mission to "strengthen democratic values" led it not only into numerous projects intended to counter Soviet influence in Europe and the developing world, but to hire as its officers men who had had practical experience in precisely those fields. Paul Hoffman, who became the President of the Foundation in 1950, came to that job from a previous position as administrator of the Marshall Plan and brought with him Milton Katz, who became a Foundation associate director; Shepard Stone, who joined the Foundation in 1952 and later ran its International Affairs program, had been director of public affairs in the office of the U.S. High Commission in occupied Germany. The Ford Foundation was eager to use culture as a weapon against Soviet totalitarianism, and its officers had practical experience in just such efforts. </p>

<p>The desire to distance high culture from commercialism motivated Laughlin and the Ford Foundation as well. Unlike New Directions, Intercultural under Laughlin's leadership had the luxury of abstaining almost entirely from participation in the capitalist economy.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Intercultural was funded by a foundation, was not expected to turn a profit or even to earn its investment back, and was distributed free of charge through U.S. embassies and consulates or at cultural events. (It was also sold in bookstores and at 

<b></b>

 newsstands.) Its editors worried more about <i>who</i> was reading it than about <i>how many</i> were buying it. In this, it further sheltered modernism—for there was no question that the project would be dominated by modernism—from its bogey, mass culture. The proposal for the creation of <i>Perspectives USA </i>specified that the purpose of the project was "to promote peace by increasing respect for America's non-materialistic achievements among intellectuals abroad." The Foundation echoed the concerns of American intellectuals and of President Eisenhower, adding that, "At present, America's cultural standard is judged by such popularized media as Hollywood movies, certain popular magazines in the mass field, etc., which arouse the derision and contempt of foreign intellectuals and students, creating an attitude which contributes to the concept of America as a commercial imperialist."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Interestingly, Laughlin blamed the "propagation" of this "false idea" that Americans are "materialists" to economics, and his solution was also economic: offering a product at a subsidized low price. </p>

<p>In the initial proposal for the magazine, Laughlin suggested that it be priced at twenty-five cents for foreign markets—enough to make it seem like an independent venture, for "if the magazine were 'given' away it might acquire the taint of propaganda."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  (In the U.S., the journal cost seventy-five cents.) Identifying the National Association of Manufacturers-style advertising that was increasingly giving pro-business forces a powerful vocabulary of words and images in American public life, but that would only play into Europeans' worst prejudices about America, Laughlin insisted that the journal should print "<i>No</i> propaganda for the 'American Way' etc."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Echoing Laughlin, IP Project Administrator Hayden Carruth (a poet and former editor of <i>Poetry</i>) wrote to Hutchins in September 1952—immediately before the first issue appeared—that,  </p>

<p>The need to correct supposedly erroneous impressions about American culture—especially those notions centering on commercialism—did not stop at the boardroom, either.

<p class="continued"><i>Perspectives USA</i> was officially founded in February 1952, when the Ford Foundation allocated $500,000 to the newly created nonprofit corporation Intercultural Publications, Incorporated expressly to publish <i>Perspectives USA</i>.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  In choosing a board of directors for IP, Laughlin, who had already yoked art together with the world of foundations and the objectives of American foreign policy, brought in the business community, precisely the element of American society so reviled by leftist intellectuals. Approved with the initial proposal was a Board of Directors consisting of bankers James F. Brownlee and Joseph Hambuechen; Charles Garside of Associated Hospital Services of New York; H. J. Heinz II, whom Laughlin knew from Pittsburgh; the publisher Alfred A. Knopf; Richard J. Weil, a vice-president at R.H. Macy &amp; Co.; and businessman William J. Casey, who had worked in the London office of the Office of Strategic Services.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  With the exception of Knopf, the Board had little credibility in the literary and intellectual world, so IP also convened "an Advisory Committee drawn from such fields as literature, philosophy, history, music, scholarship, the arts, and theater and architecture" with a heavy representation of New York Intellectuals, New Critics, and modernist writers.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  </p>

<p><i>Perspectives USA</i> was published initially in English, French, Italian, and German and distributed to European and American bookstores and newsstands for sale, and to U.S. embassies and consulates abroad for free dissemination. In advance of the first issue (which appeared in October 1952), an internal memo suggested printing 6,000 copies of the French edition, 5,000 of the British, and slightly lower numbers for the German and Italian versions, "with sights set on an eventual 15,000 or more" in each market.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> </p>

<p>The journal's editorship rotated issue by issue, among a select group drawn almost exclusively from the journal's advisory board. Laughlin edited the first number, followed by Lionel Trilling, Jacques Barzun, Malcolm Cowley, R. P. Blackmur, and others. The editor's job was less to solicit contributions than to make selections from already-printed work (few articles were commissioned specifically for <i>Perspectives</i>) and to provide an introduction that framed the issue's works within the mission of the journal. In the publisher's introduction to the first issue, Laughlin explained that, "this magazine will present literary texts from and about the United States and examples of American art and music. Its editors will try to set materials before their readers that may enable them to view the culture of the United States in accurate <i>perspective</i>."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The editor for the second issue—Lionel Trilling—granted the truth of <i>some</i> European prejudices, writing that,

<p>I have . . . tried to represent only a special and particular part of [American literary] culture. I have drawn the prose from only a few periodicals, all of relatively small circulation although their ultimate influence is, I believe, rather considerable in the moral and intellectual life of the country. All of the writers are intellectuals in the possible special sense in which that word is used in America . . . . The name implies, as I understand its use, a certain intensity of commitment, the belief that the existence and the conduct of the intellectual class are momentous in and essential to the life of society, the acceptance of intellectual activity as a mandate, a status, a personal fate. The situation of intellectuals in America is an ambiguous one, for they are both admired and resisted for presuming to be what they are.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup></p>

<p>From the first issue modernist art and literature dominated the magazine's contents. <i>Perspectives </i>1 includes work by William Carlos Williams, La Fontaine translations by Marianne Moore, a poem by Kenneth Rexroth, an overview of the work of painter Ben Shahn by Selden Rodman accompanied by color reproductions of Shahn's paintings, an appreciation of Aaron Copland by Arthur Berger, an essay on Van Gogh by art critic Meyer Schapiro, and reviews of books by Williams, Faulkner, and Mary McCarthy. The "selective listing of new books" focuses heavily on modernist art and literature (but also includes a complimentary note about Whittaker Chambers's anticommunist touchstone <i>Witness)</i>. Popular entertainments are either sneered at or absent, with the exception of an article on "Recent Trends in Motion Pictures and Television" by Gilbert Seldes (of <i>Seven Lively Arts</i> fame) in issue 4. Experiments in form are praised, while the excessively realist or explicitly political art that Trilling criticized in <i>The Liberal Imagination</i> is ignored or denigrated. But <i>Perspectives</i>'s is an institutional modernism, framed not as a revolutionary movement but as the latest phase in art's eternal inquiry into the human condition. The first piece in the first issue, Faulkner's Nobel Prize speech of 1950, adamantly insists that even in the present "tragic" era, in a time of "a general and universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it . . . there are no longer problems of the spirit. There is only the question: When will I be blown up?" But, Faulkner says, the artist must transcend these immediate fears and return to "the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup> </p>

<p>While <i>Perspectives </i>didn't have a house definition of the term "modernism," in its pages modernism was characterized by the style or form utilized by the artist, and by the artist's marginal position vis-à-vis dominant culture. In the introduction to the third issue, editor Jacques Barzun—who establishes his bona-fides as a modernist <i>avant le lettre</i> by pointing out that he had been "an early and close eyewitness of the modern movement in literature and fine arts"—calls "modernism . . . nothing distinct, but a miscellany . . . the new <i>forms </i>evolved between 1905 and 1915."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  [italics mine] Barzun stresses that although Americans may not be publicly embracing modernism yet, neither is Europe: "Its poets are <i>maudits</i>, which is to say, marginal and inaudible." <i>Perspectives</i>'s vision of modernism focuses less on the sense of history central to Pound, Joyce, and Eliot, and more on stylistic features such as abstraction, free verse, and the rejection of ornament. LeRoy Leatherman's article on Martha Graham, for instance, 

<b></b>

 compares her to "Picasso and Kandinsky" rather than "Joyce and Kafka" because she, like the painters, does not have to "work with the details of personality" as a realist must, but can rather focus her depictions on abstractions, "particular images which emerge out of a dominant image of man in his individuality, his wholeness."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  <i>Perspectives</i> also stresses, in its discussion of any genre, the way that modernist artists' true subject-matter is the <i>individual</i>: individual personality, the individual in conflict with society, the individual striving to create art, the individual's ethical responsibilities not to class or party but to human freedom. In its emphasis on individualism, <i>Perspectives</i> signals its rejection of utopianism, socialist realism, and Popular Frontism (all of which stressed art's responsibility to the group) and does much to reconcile modernism with bourgeois liberal ideology.  </p>

<p>In its evaluation of literature, <i>Perspectives</i> tended to denigrate works written to achieve sociopolitical aims and to scoff at criticism that reads literature sociopolitically. In a survey of "The Novel in America, 1920–1940," Arthur Mizener argues that "the real history of the American novel in this period" was that of Fitzgerald, Wolfe, Hemingway, Cozzens, and Faulkner, who "believed in the individual life and the final reality of the individual apprehension of experience, and very little in mass attitudes."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The second issue featured "Everybody's Protest Novel," James Baldwin's famous attack on the "very bad novel" <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, and by extension all works of art that seek primarily to achieve political, rather than aesthetic, aims. "It is, indeed, considered the sign of a frivolity so intense as to approach decadence to suggest that these books are both badly written and wildly improbable," Baldwin notes, alluding to the Popular Front/socialist-realist condemnation of modernism as "decadent." "Literature and sociology are not one and the same," Baldwin insists.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Ironically, the critical stance in these articles—in particular, their dismissal of realism—is much more congenial to the poetry reprinted in <i>Perspectives</i> than to the fiction, which consisted largely of reprints from the <i>New Yorker</i> by familiar authors such as E. B. White, William Maxwell, Jean Stafford, and John Cheever. </p>

<p>When providing an introduction to samplings of the work of a poet or painter, <i>Perspectives</i> frequently used an "overview" approach that subtly argued for those writers' and painters' enduring importance. It's not surprising, given his long-time friendship with Laughlin, that William Carlos Williams contributed to the journal, but the first issue is almost a tribute to Williams, with fifteen poems, a short story, and the essay "The Destruction of Tenochtitlán." While his contemporary work is essentially absent, here are many of Williams' best-known early poems: "The Red Wheelbarrow," "The Widow's Lament in Springtime," "This Is Just to Say," "The Great re," signaling that Williams had been welcomed into the literary establishment embodied not just by Laughlin but by Knopf, Allen Tate, Edmund Wilson, and other eminences associated with <i>Perspectives.</i> </p>

<p>In <i>Perspectives</i>, abstraction was evidence that the U.S., unlike the U.S.S.R., was a supportive environment for experimental artists. Throughout its run, <i>Perspectives</i> published a series of short overviews of American painters featuring almost exclusively those painters who had adopted abstraction and who worked in the modernist 

<b></b>

 tradition. These overviews tended to give biographical information and discussions of style and technique; attention to any kind of <i>political</i> or <i>social</i> intent for the works is essentially absent. In Issue 4, for instance, Jerome Mellquist contextualizes Marsden Hartley as one who "turned successively to postimpressionism, fauvism, cubism, symbolism, expressionism" but who turned "back to realism" in the 1930s. Was Hartley's the radical, working-class social realism that was characteristic of the 1930s? No: "He was back to Maine, Maine and a new realism" focused on Mt. Katahdin and the New England coast.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Writing about the painter Jacques Villon, Cleve Gray continues to define modernism as that which avoids commenting on the immediate, positing that Villon—after the German invasion of France, even—"began to paint an ideal world . . . [in] a language drained of the immediate and the sensational, an idiom in which he could speak of pure inwardness and serenity."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Arthur Dove, according to Robert Goldwater, "simplifies and eliminates until his whole design is unified by a single strong rhythm of free fluent forms and a few striking colors . . . there are no human res in Dove's pictures . . . his desire is to portray [nature's] immensity in symbolic terms."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) Even the magazine's covers—many by Alvin Lustig, the house designer at New Directions—were abstract designs, implicitly arguing for the supremacy of that kind of visual representation. </p>

<p>Ironically, <i>Perspectives</i>'s first article of this sort was on Ben Shahn, a painter associated with the American social realist school. Shahn is the kind of painter that a European leftist could love: "Creator of the most 'American' of images, he is more critical of his country's 'materialism,' political backwardness, and local prejudices than any Paris Existentialist on a six-months shopping tour of native blight."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  However, although Selden Rodman's article does not skirt over Shahn's political views, and a reproduction of Shahn's painting <i>Death of a Miner</i> accompanies the article, Rodman is careful not to portray Shahn as the kind of revolutionary who can't make peace with American society: Shahn also worked for "the Container Corporation, the Columbia Broadcasting Company, and such magazines as <i>Fortune</i> and <i>Harper's</i>." Striking at Shahn's endorsement by the Popular Front, Rodman argues that Shahn should really be seen as one who <i>balances</i> social conscience and mission with a devotion to form, process, and abstraction. </p>

<p><i>Perspectives</i>'s articles on architecture—both domestic and institutional—reject the collectivist architectural philosophies of Gropius and Le Corbusier for, again, a pragmatic individualism. Frank Lloyd Wright is praised as a "bitter enemy of the classical tradition" in that he believes that "all great architecture grows out of an individual response to an individual's needs."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  In terms of domestic architecture, while European modernists designed multiunit dwellings such as Le Corbusier's "Tower in the Park," <i>Perspectives </i>focuses on modernist innovations in the single-family house, even the California ranch house. Hugh Morrison, in "American Houses: Modern Style," praises Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House as "less a house in the ordinary sense than a work of abstract structural art." In terms that echo the description of modernism throughout the run of this journal, Mies's concern is "the creation of pure forms of an uncompromising technical perfection and aesthetic integrity." Morrison concludes that "modernism has won a decisive victory over eclecticism."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>

<p>Although not specifically about artistic modernism, Jacques Barzun's article "America's Romance with Practicality" could serve as the philosophical core of <i>Perspectives</i>'s approach to modernism and culture, in that it links American pragmatism to modernity and the role of the (implicitly modernist) artist in a free society. Barzun responds to the European accusations that, "Pragmatism is the national creed glorifying the businessman and now that American business dominates half the globe, practicality is king" not by denying that pragmatism dominates the U.S., but by turning the accusation back on the Europeans: the very discovery of America, he points out, was motivated by "the search for comfort and power." Pragmatism, as it is practiced in America, is in fact the potential savior of a "polyglot planet"; it <i>is </i>modernity itself, he grants—and a good thing, too. Barzun concludes with a remarkable idea of the relation between the artist and his society: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The pioneer, trader, or businessman succeeded because there was plenty of room and plenty of substance to waste. Now we need a different order of mind, still wedded to practicality—still in love with it—but more conscious, more complex, more self-critical. He may be a businessman still, or an administrator of private or state concerns, but he must learn the new lesson of effectiveness by stripping every purpose bare and seeking the minimum means to attain it . . . . This lesson he can and must learn from the only type 

<b></b>

 of man who is and has ever been an incorruptible pragmatist—the artist. . . . I suggest the transformation of our commercial and technological habits of mind under the artist's impatient desire for fitness, for complexity, and for success in the thing aimed at . . . . If America's great romance is to continue and thus prolong Western civilization, it will be because the child of that romance, the artist, has begun in our midst and with our aid his endless task of raising images of good and teaching practicality.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Just as artistic modernism expresses the essential character of free individuals in the modern world, our businessmen and administrators should learn from, and emulate, artistic modernism in their own pursuits. And the "complexity" of modernism, far from being impenetrable, esoteric, and arcane, actually creates "images of a good and teaching practicality."  </p>

<p>Finally, <i>Perspectives</i> maintained the New Critics' and New York Intellectuals' stance that artists should be "critically distanced, but engaged," a stance perhaps best extolled in Allen Tate's "To Whom Is the Poet Responsible?", a speech from a 1951 CCF conference and reprinted in issue 6. In the essay, Tate responds with characteristic sarcasm and irony to the charges (first leveled by Archibald MacLeish in <i>The Irresponsibles</i>) that the modernist poet had ignored his  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>total responsibility for the moral, political, and social well-being; it was pretty clearly indicated that had he behaved differently at some indefinite point in the near or remote past the international political order itself would not have been in jeopardy, and we should not perhaps be at international loggerheads today. We should not have had the Second World War, perhaps not even the first.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The responsibility of the poet is to be a <i>poet</i>, Tate insists; and, perhaps, eventually, poets' insights on the nature of what it is to be human will inform political action: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The human condition must be faced and embodied in language before men in any age can envisage the possibility of action. To suggest that poets tell men in crisis what to do, to insist that <i>as poets</i> they acknowledge themselves legislators of the social order, is to ask them to shirk their specific responsibility, which is quite simply the reality of man's experience, not what his experience ought to be, in any age. <i>To whom</i> is the poet responsible? He is responsible to his <i>conscience</i>, in the French sense of the word: the joint action of knowledge and judgment.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">As the editors expected, the journal was received enthusiastically in a few overseas circles, skeptically in others, and hostilely in one. The American, English, German, and Italian issues of the first number sold out in just a few weeks, while "the French edition did not do as well as the others—there is a strong wave of anti-American feeling in France at present—but the press reviews, in France as well as in the other countries, were predominantly favorable, except for attacks in the pro-Communist papers."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  A year later Laughlin wrote to Shepard Stone that "PROSPETTI [the Italian title of <i>Perspectives</i>] is a terrific success in Italy—beyond my best hopes. But . . . it is tough going in France. We may have to resort to 'planting' there. They apparently just hate an American looking package."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  (. <a href="#2">2</a> and <a href="#3">3</a>) 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Quickly, and increasingly over the short life of the magazine, its sponsors at the Ford Foundation grew impatient with Laughlin's inflexible refusal to print <i>anything</i> he considered excessively political. This change in attitude coincided with a shakeup at the top levels of the Foundation. Over the 1952 Christmas holiday, Henry Ford II ousted Hoffman from his post as President, moving the Foundation offices from Pasadena to New York and isolating Hutchins and Milton Katz (another Foundation administrator who had been a supporter of IP) in California. Ford replaced Hoffman with Rowan Gaither, a San Francisco lawyer who had headed the study group that issued the eponymous 1950 report, and a new group of administrators. The Foundation was also receiving attacks from the right, now aimed at the Fund for the Republic, a civil-liberties group (headed by Hoffman and then by Hutchins) that had sprung up in the wake of Senator McCarthy's anticommunist crusade and to which the Foundation had given $15 million. </p>

<p>The tension at the Foundation quickly filtered down to Laughlin's little project, and Foundation administrators consistently tried to narrow Laughlin's understanding of "politics" and "propaganda." Even before Hoffman left, Milton Katz wrote to Laughlin in regard to the Books for India program, urging Laughlin not to shy away from distributing <i>any</i> work that could be read as endorsing Western systems of political or economic organization. Asking Laughlin if he would feel that John Stuart Mill's <i>On Liberty</i> or <i>The Federalist Papers</i> would be "propaganda," Katz demanded, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Would it not be a rather precious definition of "culture" which would exclude books of this kind? Work of this sort might well be inappropriate for PUSA, but the scope of Intercultural Publications, Inc. will presumably be broader than the sphere of PUSA.</p>
<p>I take it that all of us would quickly agree that Intercultural Publications, Inc. should not be used as a vehicle of propaganda or cultural warfare. But the border lines are not always clear. In the anxiety to avoid propaganda it is possible to slip unwittingly into a sort of propaganda in reverse . . . . For instance, there are people who would scoff at any attempt to prevent the circulation abroad of such books as <i>Babbitt</i> or <i>Middletown</i>, but who would hold up their hands in pious horror at the thought of circulating books like <i>Darkness at Noon</i> or Beck and Godin on <i>Russian Purges and the Extraction of Confessions</i>.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">After Hoffman and Hutchins left, the pressure became more direct. Shepard Stone, who had joined the Foundation in 1953 to head its European outreach programs, preferred projects such as the CCF that combined culture and politics more pointedly. In 1954, pressured by Stone to consider aping <i>Encounter</i> and print political writing, Laughlin responded that <i>Perspectives USA</i>'s place had "always been to keep out of the political t, to think of the field of culture as one where people of opposed ideologies can still meet on friendly ground and learn to respect each other as human beings." Culture, rather than politics, was "an ideal channel of communication because it so often seems to appeal to the best side of our natures. It is a natural symbol of our aspirations for a better life."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  In a remarkable display of obliviousness to what his own magazine was doing, Laughlin suggested that Ford pull back from its political stances and separate itself from the CCF because the dissemination of high culture by itself would inevitably make things better:

<p class="continued">At the end of that year, in his 1954 annual report to the Foundation Laughlin stressed that "PERSPECTIVES does not carry any propaganda material, nor touch directly on any political issues."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup> </p>

<p>Although it is clear that the Foundation had urged him to alter his conception of the mission and editorial policy of the journal, Laughlin downplayed this: "no pressure of any kind has ever been exerted," he assured Dwight Macdonald. Responding to a draft of Macdonald's <i>New Yorker</i> article on the Foundation (later turned into a full-length book), Laughlin told Macdonald that,  </p>

<p>Even the directors, at times, were unhappy with <i>Perspectives</i>'s orientation. William Casey, for one, was angered by Mary McCarthy's article "America the Beautiful," in which McCarthy, directly confronting European accusations about American culture, laments the "vulgarity" and impoverishment of American commercial culture. Incensed, Casey told Laughlin, "I agree that we cannot eliminate criticism [of American society]. But we have managed to concentrate on it and to ignore those aspects of American society in which we can have pride. We have exaggerated the liabilities and largely ignored the assets." In a tirade that in many ways epitomizes the 1950s conflict between the disengaged critical highbrows and the cultural middlebrows, Casey then turned his ire on Trilling, the issue's editor,  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>who in his introduction, remarks that many Americans resent and resist intellectuals for being what they are. This is typical self-praise. I don't think that I resent or resist the people who call themselves intellectuals. But I do resist their frequent attempts to decide all things for all men on the grounds that they represent some superior casts (<i>sic</i>). My feeling, and that of many Americans, toward a certain type of left-wing intellectual is not based on resentment at their being intelligent or intellectual (Trilling wrongly implies that the two words are synonymous). It is based on my considered judgment that most of them are unintelligent, ignorant of many of the facts of life, and substitute slogans, cliches, and the juxtapositioning of half-baked ideas for the process of thought.</p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Casey then added that Trilling, McCarthy, and the other modernist intellectuals who dominated the journal were regrettably "ignorant of the great principles of liberty 

<b></b>

 and the concomitant requirement of decentralized economic and political power, the theory and practice of which represents one of the great American contributions to world culture."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup> </p>

<p>Laughlin defended Trilling and McCarthy's article (which had originally appeared in <i>Commentary</i>) but promised Casey that the "fourth number stresses what I would call the conservative tendencies in contemporary American culture."<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Casey also pushed for <i>Perspectives USA </i>to run an article by the management theoretician Peter Drucker—"a good change of pace for <i>Perspectives</i>"—but both Laughlin and Carruth resisted this, Carruth insisting that the article was "poorly written" but also  </p>

<p class="continued">Casey's objections here underscore the difficulty of using modernism to achieve these political ends. Casey eventually became, as Director of Central Intelligence, the very embodiment of the national-security state, but here his objections stem much more from his self-conception as a <i>businessman</i> and as a defender of "decentralized economic and political power." One can depoliticize modernism, Laughlin shows us, but it's much more difficult to de-"highbrow" it—to make it friendly to liberal capitalism. In fact, Laughlin's project was to <i>reinforce</i> modernism's association with the highbrows, and at the same time to expand the category of "highbrow" to include elites outside of the cultural world. </p>

<p>Additional pressure on Laughlin to alter his editorial stance came from the "Reece Commission," the Special Committee on Tax-Exempt Foundations of the United States House of Representatives, convened by Tennessee Representative Carroll Reece to investigate the activities of tax-exempt foundations in the United States.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  In hearings held in May and June 1954, the Committee came down hard on the Ford Foundation, especially, for supporting groups such as the Fund for the Republic and Intercultural Publications (which had printed work by former socialists and communists). No legislation came out of the Reece Commission, but it did help push public opinion against the Foundation, and especially against organizations such as Intercultural. When Laughlin wrote to the Foundation in the fall of 1954 requesting $2.5 million to keep IP running for another four years, the board responded with a terminal grant of $500,000, enough to publish <i>Perspectives</i> through issue 16 and keep Intercultural afloat until October 1956.  </p>

<p>Although Ford's changing priorities, brought about by new administrators, public pressure, and the Reece Commission's investigation, were primarily responsible for the end of the magazine, its own limited impact—the fact that it could not convincingly quantify or explain what it was accomplishing—contributed, as well. Many of the European intellectuals at whom these propaganda efforts were aimed, moreover, were 

<b></b>

 perfectly aware of what this publication was intended to accomplish, and ridiculed it because of its provenance. "The magazine provoked widespread resentment in Europe, not only because it was 'so obviously an American package,' but also because of its 'inauthentic' institutional origins," Hugh Wilford remarks, quoting a letter from Stephen Spender—who knew something about this, having been an editor of <i>Encounter—</i>to Allen Tate.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  An exhaustive "Study of 'Perspectives' in England, France, Germany and Italy" by Frederick Burkhardt of Bennington College, submitted to the Foundation in July 1954, concluded that the culture-exclusive orientation of <i>Perspectives</i> was "on the whole . . . good," but that the actual focus was too avant-garde and too literary, to the detriment of other forms of art such as music. Responses by targeted readers were equivocal—the Italian intellectual Carlo L. Ragghianti, for instance, wrote that "<i>Prospetti</i> has a very limited success and very little penetration . . . . I believe that this review has no value, or at least very little."<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  The report, ordered by Stone, was on the whole complimentary when evaluating the magazine on its own terms, but for a reader looking for evidence that <i>Perspectives</i> was having a direct effect on European leftists' attitudes about American political aims it would have been disappointing. Knopf, writing to Laughlin after seeing this report, certainly expressed Laughlin's own feelings when he said that "I think it undignified and even to a degree insulting to have our work constantly—evaluated I think is the word you used—by outsiders."<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Not everyone was disappointed by the journal. Many of Burkhardt's respondents praised <i>Perspectives</i>, and in March 1956, the Brussels office of the USIA reported happily that it was  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>one of the most effective instruments at the disposal of USIS/Brussels for informing Belgian intellectuals of developments in the arts is the Ford Foundation's "Perspectives" (French edition, "Profils") . . . . The response to "Perspectives" has been uniformly favorable, even in certain circles of "intellectuals of the left" who are normally very critical of the United States.</p>

<p class="continued">The Brussels Public Affairs officer writing this dispatch praised the journal's fiction, poetry, art criticism and reviews, noting that,  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Perspectives" has performed for the European intellectual a unique function in providing him with a panorama of contemporary American activity in the field of arts and of ideas, which is matched by no other single American periodical.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This "panorama," of course, was hardly exhaustive, or even accurate. Laughlin's portrait of American cultural life is dominated by apolitical modernist experimentalism. Charged with the responsibility of showcasing American cultural life "in accurate <i>perspective</i>," Laughlin packages an American culture dominated by just one strain and produced overwhelmingly by a small number of writers, artists, and critics. In this package created for European consumption, modernism is humanist, apolitical, and utterly dominant. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>In July 1956, <i>Perspectives USA</i> published its sixteenth and final issue, noting to its readers that "we continue to believe that cultural exchange of this kind contributes substantially to better world understanding." Epitomizing both the founding vision and the fate of the journal was George Kennan's contribution, a reprint of a lecture given at the Museum of Modern Art by the former State Department intellectual and architect of containment. In familiar terms, Kennan bemoaned European misconceptions of Americans as "vulgar, materialistic nouveaux riches, lacking in manners and in sensitivity, interested only in making money, contemptuous of every refinement of aesthetic feeling," and regretted that "the blind workings of our commercial interests" do nothing to correct those misconceptions.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  Culture—"artistic creation and the higher forms of scholarly thought"—must be brought to bear on this problem, for through culture we can find common ground with our friends in Europe even if they do not share our immediate political interests ("IEA," 10). "What we have to do," Kennan concludes, "is to show the outside world both that we have a cultural life and that we care something about it." But Kennan turns his argument around, as well, insisting not just that we need to do a better job of disseminating our high culture to Europeans but that we must truly devote ourselves to openness and exchange with other societies for our <i>own </i>good<i>: </i></p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[H]owever great the importance of international cultural exchange from the standpoint of our relations with other countries, this is not the main reason why we Americans have need for cultural contacts with other peoples at this time. The main reason lies rather in our own need as Americans for just this sort of enrichment of our national spirit. I am persuaded that any really creative development in the field of art or literature is intimately connected with international contact and is, in fact, unthinkable without it.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	("IEA," 7)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Kennan concludes that "there has grown up among us a most reprehensible habit, a totalitarian habit in fact, of judging the suitability of cultural contributions by whatever political coloration we conceive their creators to have acquired. I know of nothing sillier than this" ("IEA," 13). Facing the end of his pet project, partly because of just such a "totalitarian habit," this remark of Kennan's must have rung painfully true to Laughlin. </p>

<p>In his 1967 essay "The CIA and the Intellectuals"—one of the first articles to attack the CCF after the revelation of its CIA funding—Jason Epstein argued that the problem with the CIA's program was "not a matter of buying off and subverting individual writers and scholars"—this, in fact, would be a process quite in keeping with the capitalist model of organization that the CIA was pushing. Rather, Epstein points out that the CIA "set . . . up an arbitrary and factitious system of values by which academic personnel were advanced, magazine editors appointed, and scholars subsidized and published, not necessarily on their merits . . . . but because of their allegiances. The fault of the CIA was not that it corrupted the innocent but that it tried, in collusion with a group of insiders, to corner a free market."<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup> </p>

<p>In their significantly smaller way, <i>Perspectives</i> and IP did much the same thing. As the publisher of Pound, Williams, H. D., and many other American modernist writers, 

<b></b>

 Laughlin had already done much to shape public understanding of literary modernism. In <i>Perspectives</i>, though, Laughlin's apolitical modernism extended to encompass all of the arts; a reader of <i>Perspectives</i> was presented with an image of contemporary artistic expression in the U.S. that was remarkably of a piece in terms of style and strategy. At the same time, the oppositional, even revolutionary, impulses that underpinned so much modernist art would be redefined as being aimed not against bourgeois society, capitalism, and liberal individualism but against middlebrowism, mass culture, and Stalinoid instrumentality. In other words, Laughlin sought to "corner [the] free market" of ideas about modernism in a way that made modernism useful to the coalition of business, foundations, universities, and the state in the service of their larger politico-cultural objective: creating a cross-cultural alliance of writers, artists, and intellectuals who would discard their disdain of the U.S. and join with the Americans in opposing the Soviet threat.  </p>

<p>Perhaps the most startling thing, on first viewing the 1930 silent film <i>Borderline</i>, is the image of H. D.

dehumanized in the film, as critics have noted, his re aligned with the primitive, with stone, with sculpture, but it is a dehumanization of monumental proportion, the sort we demand of our celebrities, the distance we require of the screen image so that we may worship, unencumbered by knowledge of the myriad indignities that attend the human form. His is a command performance, his screen image calm and enduring, befitting a man of his stature, his status on the international stage. H. D. is a lesser celebrity. She is instead writerly, her re twitchy, scratchy like the nib on the page; she clearly thinks too much, and as the film opens, she is agitated at the state of her marriage, her husband having taken up with a new woman. The connection between 

<b></b>

 the two res is forged early in the film, as Astrid telephones Pete, not apparently in a gesture of friendship (confirmed in his refusal to speak to her), but in a shared outsiderness, both at the margins of their relationships, both hoping to break the bond between Pete's wife and Astrid's husband. But none of this is immediately clear. </p>

<p>Narrative opacity is predictable enough, given the film's aesthetic and intellectual interests. <i>Borderline</i> was a production of the Pool group, an avant-garde collective based in Switzerland, funded by the Ellerman family fortune (via Bryher, formerly Winifred Ellerman), and interested in saving the "universal" language of silent film from the new threat of talking pictures. Kenneth Macpherson, the film's writer and director, tried to import the imagery of psychoanalysis into his film scenario, providing what he imagined to be a visual representation of unconscious processes. He also used a readily sensationalized topic—the interracial affair between a black woman and a white man—and complicated it with the furious racism of one jilted spouse (played by H. D.) and the steadfast stoicism of the other (played by Robeson). The critical discourse surrounding <i>Borderline</i> has generally focused on questions raised by the film's racial and sexual politics. Here, rather, I discuss the film's interest in the aesthetics of the unconscious, the phenomenological response to film as sensation, and one recurring motif in the film—the hand—that brings together the Pool group's formal and affective aims. To consider the multiple tiers of the film's aesthetics will, I hope, contribute to the larger claim that the poetics of film functions simultaneously to its belief structures, resisting, undercutting, and complicating, if not altogether breaking free from, its thematic interests. The sensationalism of <i>Borderline</i>'s subject matter is so remarkable, especially in its historical context, that the film's attention to sensation itself has been overlooked. Further, because the narrative is difficult to follow and both demands and claims to repel cognitive effort, many critics have worked explicitly with the film's diegetic events, explaining those events and speaking of the homoerotics of the film's desire and its limitations regarding racial representation.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  I read against the deigetic logic of the film, then, looking to the series of frozen images, the repeated motifs that cut in and against the story of racist bigotry, both in the film's and in today's critical terms. To read the film's formalism is to decenter the primacy of narrative logic, to provide access to its visual and affective dimensions, and to offer an interpretive form that doesn't rely upon and reconstitute the identity categories already problematized by the film's many critics. The film explores sensation through the visual motif of the hand and in so doing comments on the place of film in one's physical apprehension of the world. Rather than look to the structural dynamics that have been read on to the film (white/black, civilized/primitive, etc.), I am interested in where the film's visual imagery undercuts such interpretation and offers a way to read the "interface" between film technology and human subjectivity (which in the early part of the century was coming to be defined by the irrational impulses of the unconscious).<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The film operates as a complicated layering of images, silently profuse, edited with the avant-garde techniques of montage associated in the early part of the century with Russian filmmaking; the familiar faces of the film's celebrities stand in for the familiarity of romantic convention or clear cinematic narrative. <i>Borderline</i>'s narrative logic is 

<b></b>

 notoriously difficult—a libretto was disseminated to aid the comprehension of early audiences, H. D. wrote a 39-page explanatory, and exuberantly hyperbolic, pamphlet, and Macpherson followed up its release with a palpably exasperated editorial in <i>Close Up</i>, the Pool group's film journal, that explained the film to its unimaginative and, he charged, unfeeling, public. The film might be difficult to <i>comprehend</i>, Macpherson conceded, but was it so difficult to <i>feel</i>? The film offered a response to the losses occasioned by modern life, and an attempt to invigorate, even electrify, film audiences, not through cognition, then, but through sensation. Can the viewer be shocked out of a generalized turpitude by film, the Pool group seems to ask, or is film the deadening instrument of its own destruction? These terms are, of course, recognizably Walter Benjamin's and when a title card, late in the film, asks "What do you think?" the fate of film, at least as far as the Pool members were concerned, weighed in the balance. Could film have a future? Certainly not, the group believed, if sound technology and the forces of Hollywood determined its course. By introducing sensation to the most sensationalized of scripts, Macpherson and his collaborators moved to make film not only relevant to modern experience, but also a necessary intervention in the paralysis that accompanied modern life. </p>

<p>Sensation, as a philosophical concept, has been explored throughout the history of enquiry into human consciousness, yet for my purposes here, Bertrand Russell's account most productively offers a reading of the unified experience of matter and mind foregrounded in Macpherson's film and suggests a way to imagine film as a mode of sensational experience. Distinguished from emotion by its recourse to the body and its sensory apprehension of the world, sensation relies on matter, on the surfaces against which the mind reels, moving in relation and reaction to objects and to physical events that might include the wind blowing, water falling, or the ring of a telephone. For Russell, sensation is the effect of both material and mental perception: "I should admit this view as regards sensations: what is heard or seen belongs equally to psychology and to physics," he writes.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Russell's investigations into the shared realms of psychology and physics offer a way to read the film's staging of the unconscious, the space where images are stored without reason, perhaps without access, yet whose unpredictable eruptions offer a method of narrative not based in logic, but in the spatial recombination of images, something akin to montage. In psychoanalytic theory, the unconscious works to destabilize the subject and begins a transition, as Elizabeth Abel puts it, "from transparent to unstable, internally divided, and over-determined identity categories."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Thus opening up a precarious space, a space whose foundations guarantee nothing but foundational collapse, the unconscious fractures any clear lines of subjectivity, and produces a self-difference that may, Abel argues, "open a door to other differences," including those familiar and contested differences based on categories of race, sexuality, and class.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> The unconscious as conceptual space, an underground corridor leading from self-difference to difference: this is the philosophical premise that supports the narrative of <i>Borderline</i> as it plays along the fault lines of the self to mirror a world riven by social categories of identity. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p><i>Borderline</i>, whose title itself suggests the space separating the two mental realms, works to express the unconscious yet takes place not in a dark subterranean space, but well above sea level, in a mountain village that seems, almost, to exist outside of time. Yet, even in the clean mountain air, the depravity—or at least license—of unconscious desire prevails as characters are pictured in fragments, cut up by their desire, as they pursue and react, their activity terminated in each film splice, and reborn in another frame, as another image. Taking as its premise the already sensationalized topic of an interracial and adulterous love affair, <i>Borderline</i> opens up with the image of a train that, we will later understand, brings Pete to the isolated village. (The same image, the train roaring along the tracks, will end the film as it takes Pete away, alone and driven from the village by its xenophobic populace). Pete's purpose is to reclaim Adah (Eslanda Robeson), his lover (or wife—there is some opacity here) who has left him for Thorne (Gavin Arthur). The viewer witnesses the violent end of an argument between Adah and Thorne, and sees Astrid, Thorne's spurned and desperate lover (or wife), in the next room as she reports the demise of the relationship to Pete. The rooms in which Thorne, Astrid, and Adah are staying are located above a small café-bar that employs a butch bar manager (Bryher), a free-spirited barmaid (Charlotte Arthur), and a bejeweled pianist (Robert Herring). As critics have persuasively argued, the bar manager and pianist are unmistakably coded as gay; the barmaid is less overtly readable, however, her joie de vivre and expansive sexuality seem multiply directed as she laughs, smokes, and flirts with most everyone she encounters.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> She is a re of movement in an otherwise static environment: she sings, dances, and laughs and is shown to be someone motivated by pleasure and compassion. The bar serves as a relatively stable common ground where the private dramas of the two couples may be played out, and where the people of the town may appear, bringing with them their culturally-coded antipathies (most explicitly, their racism). The village may seem to exist outside of time, its cobblestoned streets and centuries-old buildings a backdrop to life as it has always been, but its resistance to change itself and its hostility to the racial otherness in the re of Pete place it in historical time and position its townspeople within a larger cultural current of tightening group affiliation. Adah doesn't seem to elicit hostility, her status as black woman, perhaps, rendering her invisible, despite the sexual transgression that sets the narrative moving. </p>

<p>Macpherson's film takes on large "political" questions—the growing fascism of the small mountain village, the racism that signals Astrid's demise—yet its interest is as much in the possibilities of expressing physical emotion, the senses alive (as if galvanized in its original sense of electrically shocked) in the emotional turmoil that the film unfolds (in fact, in her pamphlet H. D. somewhat disingenuously claims that the film is not interested in political questions at all, but wants only to engage its audience "purely" as a work of art, free of the taint of political interest). The members of Pool—notably Macpherson, H. D., and Bryher—wanted to rid the film of the conventions of narrative logic, yet understood that it would not be readily accessible to the average viewer. As noted above, the group carefully guided its public reception with a substantial amount of instructive text (remarkable for a film apparently interested in the opacity of the 

<b></b>

 unconscious). The film was, then, mediated from its first release as prospective audiences were told what they needed to know in order to view it most productively, and most appreciatively. To appreciate <i>Borderline</i> was to give oneself over to its landscape of feeling, to make one's mind passive, to succumb to the images on screen and allow oneself new modes of physical experience. The on-screen representation, Macpherson hoped, would convince even the most phlegmatic Englishman into <i>feeling</i>, promising, then, access to a heretofore unknown realm of sensual experience. Macpherson makes this claim in his defensive explication of his film published in <i>Close Up</i>:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The Englishman rejects too much of his emotional being, and is embarrassed if he has to be brought face to face with it. His fear of "morbidity" and the neurotic is a race neurosis which sets him at a disadvantage when it comes to emotional, or mental-emotional experience. This attitude is clearly evident among my critics. They reject <i>Borderline</i>, not because it is complex—for its power is its complexity, its "unexplainedness"—like something seen through a window or a keyhole; but because it is a film of sub-conscious reasoning. And if, among the English, the sub-consciousness is ruefully admitted, for some definitely social reason it "is not to be condoned!"<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p class="continued">The inexplicability of the unconscious realm, its obscurity translated into the film medium, allows a secret view, a momentary pleasure associated with voyeurism or a moment at the keyhole. Macpherson understands why the English public may not want to claim its unconscious space, since it is associated with those desires that society demands we censor, yet rails against the failure to face the interpretive uncertainty, the incoherence, and the access to our shared darkness offered by the film. The Englishman's "fear of morbidity," that unwillingness to look at humanity's unwholesome face, marks the failure of film audiences to understand and appreciate <i>Borderline</i>. Yet, as well as the boldness of illicit desire, it is the complexity of its representation—the source of its power—that challenges and inhibits its audience who seem to be unwilling to <i>experience</i> the film on a more visceral, or at least less cognitive, level. Legibility, Macpherson complains, is a borderline across which critics won't stray (as a number of modernists discovered); he vigorously mounts an attack against the pretense of a transparent image easily comprehended and defends obscurity, unreadability, and sensation over the relative straightforward processes of cognition. This is a film of "sub-conscious reasoning," which reasons then unreasonably, and inscribes contradiction and interpretive difficulty as an ideal. It is ironic that the terms of the debate surrounding the critical reception of the film—readability, obscurity, abstraction, and legibility—are the terms that Macpherson himself introduces through his interest in the unconscious; as the director well knew, the unconscious itself is predicated on its impenetrability, its resistance to interpretation, and its endless capacity for generating anxiety about its contents. </p>

<p>The modern world, characterized not just by racial and class division, but also by the numbing effects of urban industrial life, was insensate, unresponsive, and persuasively red by the industrial sky and etherized patient of T. S. Eliot's "Prufrock." While Eliot's conclusion is bleak, the Pool group offered a radical reinterpretation, an alternative 

<b></b>

 response to the losses occasioned by modern life through sensation. <i>Borderline</i>, as an intellectual enterprise, delves into the obscurity and complexity of feeling—the film in fact proposes a new dimension of film affectivity. Its experiment, however, is to visualize the senses shorn of logic in order to visualize the unconscious, where rules of adjacency rather than logic govern, and where the senses reign over sense-making. Agitation, from the Latin <i>agere</i>, refers to a driving force, comprehensible in a post-Freudian world as the drives that motivate and propel us. The film provides a visual record of the drives, and understands itself largely in terms of the unconscious. What lurks there? What scandal? <i>Borderline</i> will give a series of visual fragments in response, fractured, agitated, furious, homicidal, and above all, desiring. </p>

2. Reasoning with the Unconscious 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Bertrand Russell is also a reader of the unconscious—though more as a cultural force than as a psychological one—and analyzes the ways that Freudian theory presents it to the general public as metaphor. Albeit brief, Russell's focus on psychoanalysis, in his series of lectures collected in <i>The Analysis of Mind</i>, contributes, in interesting ways, to Freud's metaphoric use of spatial topographies and the unspoken desires on which it depends and illuminates, if necessarily dimly, the use of the unconscious in <i>Borderline</i>. Russell reads psychoanalysis as a literary critic might, looking for its mode of fiction-making, stylistic panache, and recurring images or tropes. He eschews what he views as the psychoanalytic tendency toward exaggeration, yet recognizes the usefulness of the conclusions that it frequently draws: "Many psychoanalysts," he writes, "are unduly narrow . . . this, however, does not affect the value of their general theories from the point-of-view of theoretic psychology, [it is] from this point-of-view that their results are important for the analysis of the mind" (<i>AM</i>, 16). Russell particularly criticizes the theory of the unconscious for its unscientific air of mystery, its vagueness, and its failure to describe the contents of unconscious desire, and points to the propensity of psychoanalytic discourse to create images that are more compelling than they are logically convincing. In the following passage, he paints a picture, remarkable for its own descriptive excess, of the unconscious as a dark repository of secret desires: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Thus "the unconscious" becomes a sort of underground prisoner, living in a dungeon, breaking in at long intervals upon our daylight respectability with dark groans and maledictions and strange atavistic lusts. The ordinary reader, almost inevitably, thinks of this underground person as another consciousness, prevented by what Freud calls the "censor" from making his voice heard in company, except on rare and dreadful occasions when he shouts so loud that everyone hears him and there is a scandal. Most of us like the idea that we could be desperately wicked if only we let ourselves go. For this reason, the Freudian "unconscious" has been a consolation to many quiet and well-behaved persons.</p>

	(<i>AM</i>, 19)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The prisoner—angry, vituperative, lustful—lives beneath our feet, below ground, out of sight and out of earshot until those momentary breaks into the open air, and then 

<b></b>

 scandal ensues. He is not so much a representation of the unconscious, as one of <i>another</i> consciousness, another subject who exists <i>with</i> rather than within us, a stranger whose strange desires exist just below the floorboards. This is the site of otherness, an alterity startling, fascinating, and weirdly reassuring: despite the potential horror that Russell acknowledges, the untamed animal, the other that threatens to undo our polite facades instead consoles, makes up for the ongoing discomfort afforded those of us who are quiet and well-behaved persons.  </p>

<p>It is not, though, the consolation, or the tapping into our own unknown desires, offered by our encounter with otherness that Russell criticizes, but the image itself of the unconscious as dark repository. It too simply explains, by bifurcation into two separate mental systems, the desires that drive us and that constitute our experiential lives: "What is an unconscious desire?" Russell asks and comments, "we observe that Freud and his followers, though they have demonstrated beyond dispute the immense importance of 'unconscious' desires in determining our actions and beliefs, have not attempted the task of telling us what an 'unconscious' desire actually is, and have thus invested their doctrine with an air of mystery and mythology which forms a large part of its popular attractiveness" (<i>AM</i>, 18). There may be something attractive, or deeply compelling, as Russell asserts, in thinking of ourselves as inherently rebellious, wicked, and devoted to bizarre and secret pleasures despite our pleasant demeanors and professional attitudes; each of us, that is, comprised not just of drives and the rules that govern them, but also of a sensational space, a space from which unruly voices shout extraordinary and shameful things. This space may be a fiction, as Russell contends, yet it is a fiction, he also notes, in which the public wants to believe, a space whose representation as fearful dungeon mollifies with its image of otherness just out of our reach, there and not there, a potential scandal waiting to disrupt our quotidian lives.  </p>

<p>This sensational space, the space of the unconscious as we might imagine it, is thus obscure, chaotic, and cloaked in mystery, a mystery to which, Russell claims, the popular imagination clings. It is this sensational space as a space of terror, chaos, and a liberating otherness that <i>Borderline</i> provides us with a vision of our own feral selves, locked up behind doors with weak hinges. <i>Borderline</i> situates itself at a number of crossings—at those borders that separate social, geographic, and especially psychological realms. Investigating the unconscious, though an impossible project to consummate, might (as Russell seems to believe) allow some understanding of the contents of unconscious desire, the desire that knows no rules, that horrifies the censor, and that yearns (like a separate entity) to make itself heard. The unconscious, of course, is only available as a fantasy, viewed from a perch at an imaginary keyhole; there we might hope to witness something shocking, unfamiliar, terrifying, and altogether fascinating. Macpherson's position behind the camera lens, looking through the viewfinder, frames an unconscious and sensational world for us as he conceives it.   </p>

<p>The word sensation, of course, is not singular in meaning and points in multiple directions, as Russell's definition of sensation "as the intersection of mind and matter" suggests. "Sensation" is an intersection that undoes any easy division between mind and body and connotes instead a <i>shared</i> physical and mental experience: it also, within 

<b></b>

 this broader framework, refers to the multiple realms of the senses, the success of any given person or event, a certain level of excitement, and the "faculty through which the external world is apprehended."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Sensation will be spatialized in Russell's theory, just as Freud's theory of the unconscious famously relies on res of spatial topography: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . different senses have different spaces. The space of sight is quite different from the space of touch: it is only by experience in infancy that we learn to correlate them . . . . The one space into which both kinds of sensations fit is an intellectual construction . . . . And besides touch and sight, there are other kinds of sensation which give other, though less important spaces: these also have to be fitted into the one space by means of experienced correlations.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Sensation follows a logic of correlation, of spatial analogy, one might say, and this is employed as the structuring logic of MacPherson's film. Pete, hoping to convince Adah to come back to him, pursues her through the cobblestoned streets of the village. While Pete nearly catches her before she disappears around a corner or up some stairs, the viewer sees another interspersed action: a kitten toys with a fish caught in a small glass jar, left, presumably by a child, on the street. While the intent to kill isn't obvious, the inevitable outcome for the fish seems bleak as the small paw scoops at the water. Sensation, anatomized through the image of the kitten's wet paw and Pete's hasty pursuit over an uneven path, is fully realized at the moment where Pete and Adah meet under a stone arch and seem to merge with the stone itself; Pete's hand, outstretched, suggests his desire, while both faces betray little expression at their reunion. Simultaneously, or so it seems through the film's editing, a mother appears to discipline a resistant child. It becomes clear that this is social discipline at work, as we see that she is putting shoes on his feet. Through editing, civilized necessity meets instinctual necessity, as the kitten pursues its prey and Pete catches Adah. The kitten and fish, and mother and child scenes only make sense in relation to the pursuit of Adah by Pete. All pursuers, it is worth noting, are poised to succeed: action is rewarded in this segment of film. Social demand (a man must have a loyal wife) and instinctual demand combine through the sequencing of the frames and explain, for the audience, the necessity of Pete's actions. Only through the logic of adjacency does this sequence of scenes acquire any meaning for the viewer.  </p>

<p>Sensation, not immediately representable on film, relies on the image which comes to mediate it and which allows its representation in film. The image acts as filmic corollary to sensation which registers already as a loss—the price paid for modern technologies. Russell meditates on the distinction between sensation and image at length in his lectures and provides a causal explanation for the appearance of the image. An image, in Russell's theory, is not of the world of physics, but is a mental copy, a record of past sensation; it is a mental apprehension of a felt event, what remains of a momentary sensory perception that is filed away as a "copy" to be accessed at a later time: "A sensation," he writes, "fades gradually, passing by continuous gradations to the status of an image" (<i>AM</i>, 105–106). Sensation is copied, recorded, and available only through the mnemic processes as image: it is, therefore, like film, whose visual 

<b></b>

 field is one that relies on copies, and like the unconscious itself acts as a repository of images.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Film can only ever approximate sensation through recourse to the image, or a copy of the image which already is a copy of a copy, and so on. As if to underscore this, Macpherson interjects explicit references to copies throughout his narrative—a gramophone, several photos, a gull whose taxidermized body copies the posture of life, and Astrid's theatrical death-like swoon which will be copied by her murder, though this final homicidal event will take place offscreen. The viewer sees her immobile hand as evidence of her death, and the re of the hand is echoed as Thorne contemplates his own damaged and murderous hands in the following scene. The image then, as it is copied and becomes part of the circulating currency of the unconscious, is an abstraction, removed from its original context, stripped of its conscious accompaniments, and available as an autonomous vehicle of recorded sensation. Through the abstraction, or fragmented detail, a sensory collage emerges that offers an immersion into feeling rather than cognition or the interpretation that was linked, for the film's makers, on a previous generation's model. </p>

<p>An abstraction always involves a "taking away," a reduced field of information, a form that takes shape through the absence around it (also the mode of unconscious organization). Surrounding "matter" disappears, as the abstraction moves, like the image, into another realm undefined by the material world, and easily, one might imagine, into the unconscious. H. D.—well-known in 1930 as H. D., <i>imagiste</i>—was very much interested in methods of abstraction that worked to produce a powerfully aestheticized image which might allow its viewer or reader to experience extraordinary intensity in the face of that image. Imagism was constituted by abstraction, by the carefully isolated image that could wield a powerful impact. With cold, clean precision, the imagist poem presented itself as concentrated and exquisitely carved, its excesses pared away so that only the essential image remained, the "radiant node" in Pound's phrase, that produces a sense of vertigo with its rush of related images; though several years past (Pound made his proclamations about imagism in 1912), H. D. sees something similar to the principles of imagism at work in Macpherson's film. In her pamphlet, she champions Macpherson's conceptual methods, and draws a picture of radiant abstraction: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There are moments, in Mr. Macpherson's sequences, when a flash of white hand or the high lights across the knuckles of a black hand become, you might say, as "sterile" as certain much-vaunted "effects" of sieve, tooth-pick, or cullander. But when Mr. Macpherson plays upon abstraction, it is in reference to some other abstraction. A telephone receiver of usual form and literacy, is dealt with, as abstraction, though it merges to the concrete when applied to succeeding abstraction of a stern chin line. The method of Mr. Macpherson is admittedly an "abstract" method, but he is only satisfied when abstraction coupled with related abstraction makes logical dramatic sequence. A little oil can, for instance (concise modernistic abstraction) relates to a giant negro shoulder. Oil and heat are related to a dark brow, that great head that bends forward, very earth giant.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The white hand, the black knuckles, the giant negro shoulder: bodies become part of a landscape of objects, equal, H. D. wants to suggest, to the oil can, the sieve, the tooth-pick, the telephone receiver. H. D. removes each fragment from a larger social 

<b></b>

 landscape in which it would acquire more fully determined meaning (although her reliance on racial types and her insistence on embellishing body fragments with adjectives suggests some of the film's many problems with racial representation). Her repetition of the word "abstraction" in the passage suggests something of the significance she attributes to abstraction itself as an aesthetic quality, as a virtue, and as something "new" in the world of film already grown highly conventionalized. H. D. looks to the new relations established by extracting images from a familiar context and reorganizing them on a different plane to yield different effects. Abstraction and related abstraction build upon and copy one another within Macpherson's frame; H. D. comments that he does not simply play upon abstractions, but has each abstraction refer to yet another abstraction, in an endless metonymic chain of images. A Negro shoulder paired with an oil can brings the body into a mechanical and sterile space, or into a realm of line and contour over that of meaning. </p>

<p>Even race itself in the film's narrative stands in for something immaterial, another sort of abstraction over the material difference of skin color. One, of course, might argue that race is always an abstraction, a categorical code rather than an essential difference, even though those codes determine the essential life experience of those who are categorized at the borders, or margins, of white normativity. In <i>Borderline</i>, Paul Robeson's character emblematizes stillness; he is monumentalized, fetishized, made static and calm. In a world of violent and erratic emotions, he is the still point around which obsession violently swirls. As critics have noted, he is a representation of the primitive, but a primitive tamed, given to highly codified romantic desire over the tempests of sexual desire. Pete comes to the mountain village to reclaim Adah, and is thus given a degree of agency that is denied her, yet in the terms of the film's framing, he is always the object. His body is scrutinized in every frame, "sculpted," as H. D. puts it in her pamphlet, from light and, it would seem, from stone.  </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
3. The Hand in the Machine 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>An early indication of the emphasis on Pete as (erotic) object in the film will be the framing of his hands.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The film's viewers will, no doubt, note the repeated, one might even say heavy-handed, trope of hands throughout the film. Hands serve as the primary index to the sense of touch, but rendered in visual language, their symbolic range is greater, extending to all the senses. The hand stands (as it were) apart, abstracted from the body, as an indicator of sensation, the combined experience of emotion and the body. Are hands the betrayer of desire or the iconic symbol of our shared humanity? Do hands become the signifiers of all that is concrete, or are they instead abstractions, symbols of something intangible, like the emotions? In thinking about hands in this period, one remembers Wing Biddlebaum, Sherwood Anderson's troubled protagonist whose hands, like hummingbird wings, are barely visible for their movement as they dip and curve and flash through the air, alighting for a bare instant before they are in motion once more. <i>Borderline</i> takes a similar interest in hands, though in the film they seem to be stopped in time, framed, made static, sculptural, concrete, and iconic. 

<b></b>

 Pete's hands are photographed at different angles, in multiple frames, as they hang, unmoving, relaxed, signifying his monumental calm and his phallic power that is both given and denied him by the film's narrative. (. <a href="#3">3</a> and <a href="#4">4</a>) The multiple shots of Pete's hands give the sense that the film is actually slowing down, reflecting something greater than human time, geologic time, perhaps, that transcends the tiny dramas that mark human lives. Yet despite the gravity bestowed upon them by the camera's almost-still photography, the hands also connote sexuality. Pete's hands seem beseeching, masculine, and powerfully determined in their close-up framing: their smooth masculinity will be chosen by Adah who leaves Thorne and returns to her original lover. </p>

<p>Do hands, then, signify origins, originality, a return to something primal, before civilization, before the invention of, say, the moving picture? The repeated emphasis on hands suggests that Macpherson is looking for a way to introduce an authenticity aligned with the primitive and with nature. One might also surmise that Macpherson included so many shots of hands to reassure his own doubts about the reality that film does replace human contact, the hand of the artist, with its cold celluloid frames. This modernist film expresses shock throughout, yet locates itself in the pastoral space of an old-world mountain village, as if to deny any impact of the contemporary urban on its characters. The train as an image of rupture begins and ends the film; yet the film seems aware of the paradox that the representation of nature can only be transmitted by a mechanical invention that operates as its own disturbance. The focus on hands might be read as a step away from the shock technology associated with film as a mechanized medium. Hands will <i>at times</i> re presence, although the medium of film is predicated upon absence, the flickering and insubstantial image constituted by little more than light. The hands, thus, bring the viewer back to the work of art, the hand of the artist, and to a fantasy of desire unmediated by the cold technologies of twentieth-century film. Just as the image of Astrid's hand at the moment of her death signifies both life and life lost, Macpherson deploys the hand as trope to signal the power of human sensation, and its inevitable loss as it transmutes into image, a copy of feeling, that he will once again attempt to inject with vitality.  </p>

<p>The loss of sensation, due to the mechanical world, and to the conversion of felt experience into mental image is most identified with the film's female characters. The hands of Pete and Thorne appear as emblems of their participation in the sensual world, their homoerotic brotherhood sealed in their clasped hands near the end of the film. (<a href="#5"> 5</a>)<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Women's hands seem to have a more complicated role as potential threat, or conveyors of the loss that is red by the mechanics of image. Women's hands may work to erase sexual difference: the bar manager keeps her hands in tight fists, covering her breasts, in a number of shots throughout the film. If her hands cannot signify the phallus as effortlessly as the hands of Pete and Thorne, they will perform another feat of gendering, or cross-gendering. The effect of her motionless and tightly balled fists, however, is to enfeeble the bar manager's otherwise strong, butch presence in the film, making her both aged and child-like at once. The camera also focuses on the hands of the barmaid, as she performs what might be an exotic, or balletic, dance, but aligns more closely to a gull-arm that moves mechanically in an awkwardly executed 

<b></b>

 dance. The hand, fingers touching, mirrors a bird's head, like the stuffed gull that presides over Astrid's room. The women's hands appear less natural somehow, as do Astrid's thin and claw-like hands that clutch the telephone or the edges of her fringed shawl. These images are already at a remove from the natural order; they are atrophied hands, curled, clawed, and unable to signify the broadly felt sensation identified with Pete and Thorne. While Thorne's and Pete's masculinity and sexuality are embodied in their open hands, the cramped and almost mechanical hands of the women remove them from nature and align them instead with the machinery of film.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> </p>

<p>Just two years before making <i>Borderline</i>, the Pool group had published a book of early film theory, <i>Anatomy of Motion Picture Art</i>, whose author, Eric Elliott, writes of the general suspicion regarding film and its alignment with a lifeless technology, a technology that turns all before its lens into lifeless objects for our visual consumption: "it may be argued that these devices of the camera are mechanical. The charge of mechanicalness is made against the cinema with mechanical regularity, as if the motion picture alone should stand natural and pure among the arts."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Elliott cites a paradox governing public response to film: audiences could not forgive the motion picture for its inhumanity, its gaze that originated in a mechanical device rather than with the human eye, yet nonetheless required the cinema to disavow its "mechanicalness" and align itself with the natural world. Macpherson draws on this desire to overcome technology and to undo the division that film images depend upon. He cuts nature into his film, especially 

<b></b>

 in his frequently cited "clatter montage" segment where Pete's image is interchanged with the image of a waterfall. The fast montage that, literally, strips Pete, cutting his image into tiny segments of film, suggests self-division, yet it is a self-division healed in the flood of images by the restorative power of nature. Yet on further reflection, one might mount a different argument to the familiar critique of film as ring a loss of humanity: like the charge produced by the surging waters over an electric carbine, Macpherson harnesses the power available to him and produces a rush of images whose effect is like that of a combustible force, not to soothe the audience, but to charge it with the electric shock of sensation, even if that sensation is only available as image, a "faded" form of sensation. Nature, in the montage sequence, provides then a vision of loss rather than one of presence, the nostalgia that characterizes Pete (in his quest to regain Adah's love), and the desire that resides in irreparable loss.  </p>

<p>Loss, in another guise, appears as a gloved hand enters the screen toward the end of the film. Astrid is dead, Thorne has been acquitted of her murder, Adah has left town. The white cloth hand delivers an envelope to the bar manager. Significantly, this hand is ungendered and unraced, its flesh almost entirely hidden from view as it completes its mechanical task. (<a href="#6"> 6</a>)<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The letter is typed, marked by the machine of industrial society, and its message is equally marked: Pete must leave town. The gloved hand seems to comment on the human inability to feel, as it presents an unfeeling epidermal substitution: the machine delivering the machine-made message. The title card that follows reads, "What do you think?" What can Pete or the bar manager think? What can we think? The film delivers its cold reality. The bar manager apologizes for the town's behavior, this title card ending as she claims "We are like that." The layer of assumption is thick in the statement, that "we" is knowable; that we are like "that," transparent, predictably narrow. But a corroborating card, presumably giving voice to Pete, soon follows and complicates the certainty of the barmaid's assertion: "Yes," Pete agrees, "we are like that". (<a href="#7"> 7</a>) This title card presents us with the affirmation or at least recognition of group identity, an echo, a copy of the earlier statement, a confusion of "we," that now becomes more expansive and inclusive. The barmaid's "we" and Pete's echo leaving the sentence infinitely open: Who is "we"? What is "that"? </p>

<p>When Macpherson writes that film's greatest gift is the obliteration of identity, perhaps this is to what he refers, the obliteration of the "we" as a selective category, as a cohesive pronoun that seeks to repel otherness.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> Instead, as Pete departs, the "we" is put into question through the vehicle of the copy, the repetition that repeats with a difference. As the film ends, Astrid has been wiped out, Adah has disappeared from view, Thorne has been redeemed, and Pete, having served his role in that redemption, is banished. Yet it is for him, that the film mourns. The piano player, whose jewelry alone signals his representational otherness, plays to a photo of a man that appears to be Pete. The image, propped up on the piano, later tucked sadly into a breast pocket, inspires the music; the pianist's desire is channeled through his fingers; his hands mechanical and sensual, in constant movement, seeking and not finding. The photo in the film, the static copy in the midst of the moving frames, best demonstrates the dynamic of desire and its arrest in the film. (<a href="#8"> 8</a>) Pete is the arrested re, available for 

<b></b>

 consumption, but only as image, only via the attention-worn edges of a photographic still. It is Pete that we want—or is it Paul Robeson?—in the illusory fullness of his presence and, ultimately, in the knowledge of his loss? For, in the end, sensation is an illusion, a fantasy of experiencing ourselves without the mediation of technology, of urban industrial life, as originals rather than copies. Astrid, obliterated from the film for her failure to mask the kinetic pace and mechanical postures associated with the loss of sensation, has been forgotten. Pete allows us to hold on to the fantasy a little longer, especially given the terms of his departure. If only he hadn't been driven out of town, we could believe in our humanity—and here it is the most expansive definition of "our"—as our ability to feel. By forcing his removal, paradoxically the film perpetuates its belief in sensation, in a world unmediated by the image. Robeson himself offers the further consolation of celebrity. That is, celebrity emerges as an acceptable form of detachment, a faded form of sensation; it provides the coolness of the image that entreats us, yet gives us nothing.</p>

<p>H. D.'s weathered face offers another image—the aging woman, the loss of beauty, the beating taken from life. The face that Perdita Schaffner, H. D.'s daughter, describes as "very beautiful, quite magical in appearance—tall, gaunt and graceful, with exquisite bone structure and searching grey eyes" is only visible in stark contours. Schaffner goes on to say of H. D. that "she was also very excitable. Her descents into everyday life were an ordeal."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The winged descent, beating into life, the ordeal and promise of the image itself that contains her remarkable features and the static fervor of her gestures is what <i>Borderline</i> presents and asks us to respond with visceral horror. Astrid doesn't survive the film, yet her death underscores the importance of abstraction, the defining mode of the unconscious that the film investigates. The obliteration of identity—both an effect of film and a description of the unconscious—may be powerfully destabilizing and therefore ultimately enabling for the film viewer. Released from the logics 

<b></b>

 that structure individual lives, audience members may experience not just alternative narratives, but alternative ways of being, of experiencing life itself. The obliteration of identity may be the cinema's greatest gift, yet that doesn't necessarily imply that this will be the gift of comfort. The unconscious as an obscure and obliterating space projected on to the screen will not titillate viewers in any simple voyeuristic sense. Instead the film disturbs viewer expectation, or as Charles Affron puts it, "the comfort of what we recognize."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  <i>Borderline</i> attempts to reposition its viewers, as it were, within their own bodies, within their own sensate spaces, in order to open up new dimensions of affectivity within the confines of a prohibitory culture. </p>

<p>The advertisement that announced the release of <i>Borderline</i> in 1930 declared: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>BORDERLINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a herald</p>
<p>Borderline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a promise</p>
<p>BORDERLINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sensation<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Reflecting on the advertisement, readers might wonder what exactly it did herald and promise, beyond, that is, a film sensation. <i>Borderline</i>, in the end, wasn't a film sensation—in the sense, at least, of box office return or critical acclaim—although it did offer an investigation into film expressivity and the nature of sensation itself. The Pool film would attempt to externalize the otherness created by the unconscious, that harrowing space which had recently captured the public imagination. <i>Borderline</i> was challenging on a number of fronts: it used an already anachronistic silent film form, created a film rhetoric that was opaque and largely difficult to follow, disrupted the conventions of racial representation in film and, with its attempt to project unconscious desire—whether interracial, same-sex, violent, pecuniary, adulterous, predatory, alcoholic, homicidal, or racist—on to the screen, undermined the familiar codes of popular film narrative. But what the film most insistently presents is a vision of the expressive possibilities of film, the film's machinery of expression: the film image works to create sensation—not the sensation typically associated with the box office hit, but with the body's surface, and with the agitation that might wake an insensate public from its slumber. </p>

<p id="lead">Debate about the so-called "end of art" has tended to dominate discussion of Hegel's aesthetics.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  One consequence of this is that his remarks about the art of modern time (<i>neuere Zeit</i>) are interpreted in light of the historical thesis concerning art's decline or demise. It is possible, however, to examine what Hegel says about the art of modern time, understood to mean not just the art of his time but more generally art under conditions of modernity, without becoming entangled in the search for its end. Although Hegel's scattered remarks do not constitute a fully worked out theory of art, they contain important ideas about creative work under conditions of modern freedom. Furthermore, because Hegel's account of the distinctive challenges that confront modern artists is shaped by a vision of the world to which the artist belongs and from which he chooses his subject matter, it gives us access to a Hegelian perspective on modernity. This perspective is of value because it enables us to recover elements that are not habitually emphasized by prevalent interpretations.  </p>

<p>Hegelian reconstructions of modernity take their cue from Hegel's frequently repeated claim that modern individuals realize their identity by making themselves "at home" in the world.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The banishment of what is alien does not describe a single project, cognitive, metaphysical, ethical, or political, but rather a cluster of projects that conjointly make it possible to encounter the world as a homely place.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  While it is possible to identify specific theses that make up this cluster, for instance that no such a thing as an unknowable substance that remains persistently beyond the realm of possible experience exists, the power of these reconstructions lies in their twining together 

<b></b>

 several discrete elements into a broader progressivist narrative of humanity's coming of age. Modernity coincides with the attainment of a metaphorical maturity, as liberation from unknown forces and from expectations of heavenly rewards brings about gains in freedom and self-knowledge. In a critical discussion of Leo Strauss's account of modernity, Robert Pippin gives a succinct formulation of this view: "We 'tear ourselves apart' for Strauss  . . .  because we in essence don't know what we're doing, not, as in Hegel, because more and more gradually, we do."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The aim of this paper is to recover the more nuanced image of emancipation—and of what we come to know "we're doing"—that can be obtained if we follow the clues that Hegel gives us in his remarks on the art of modern times. </p>

<p>Two features, commonly emphasized in philosophical reconstructions of Hegel's narrative of modernity, concern us here: first, the normative side of the idea of emancipation from nature, and from anything that can count as "nature," that is, as "externally given," and second, the assumption of normative authority by an intramundane subject.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In particular I want to examine how emancipation from external authority hooks on to a process of internalization of cognitive and moral authority by a subject (often presented as a putative "we") which issues norms in its own name. I will be arguing that the compelling force of an authority that appears <i>as </i>external and alien retains a central role in Hegel's account of modern freedom. Failure to appreciate this leads to failure to appreciate the morally as well as epistemically ambiguous status of the <i>telos</i> of inhabiting a tamed, familiar world.  </p>

<p>I approach these issues at first from the vantage point offered by Hegel's lectures on aesthetics. Hegel lectured on aesthetics and philosophy of art for several years, starting in 1818 in Heidelberg. The edition of the lectures that was prepared by H. G. Hotho and published after Hegel's death became the standard work of reference. However, recent scholarship indicates strongly that in editing Hegel's lectures Hotho imposed a more rigid and systematic structure on the material than is detectable in the extant student notes. In the present paper, while quotations are mainly from the Hotho edition of the lectures, references are given also to the student notes, including Hotho's own transcripts from 1823. That such cross-reference is possible, given the brevity of the student notes compared with the three volume edition of the <i>Lectures on Fine Art</i>, suggests that the topic of the art of modern times was a central concern for Hegel.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Still, his discussion remains fragmentary and allusive. It is therefore useful to establish as a point of reference a work of art which can be illuminated through Hegel's remarks and which, in turn, can function as a pictorial heuristic in understanding his remarks about artistic freedom. This is attempted here with Théodore Géricault's <i>Le radeau de la Meduse</i> (<i>The Raft of the Medusa</i>), originally exhibited in 1819, one year after the first set of Hegel's lectures on art, which we can see as a modern painting, of what Hegel terms the "human spirit actually self-determining" (<i>A</i>, 607, II 238; <i>Hotho</i>, 204).

1. "Only the present is fresh"—Hegel  
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>In his introduction to the <i>Lectures on Fine Art</i>, Hegel claims that "the conditions of our present time are not favourable to art" (<i>A</i>, 10, I 25; <i>Pfordten</i>, 54). He explains this by saying that "our whole spiritual culture is of such a kind that [the practicing artist] himself stands within the world of reflection and its relations, and could not by any act of will and decision abstract himself from it' (<i>A</i>, 11, I 25; see also <i>Hotho</i>, 203, 204). It is in this context that the famous remark occurs that "art, considered in its highest vocation, is and remains for us a thing of the past" (ibid.). In order to concentrate on Hegel's account of modern artistic practice, it is important to isolate it from his broader thesis about art's changing vocation. If we do this, we are left with a powerful account of the intimate relation between artistic creation and the modern culture the artist inhabits. The key element in this relation, Hegel claims, is "reflection." We may ask then, how does "reflection" influence artistic practice? </p>

<p>At the close of the section on the "end of romantic art," Hegel expands the point he made earlier about the culture of reflection and argues that "the cultivation of reflection, criticism, and  . . .  the freedom of thought" liberates the modern artist from "bondage to a particular subject-matter and mode of portrayal" (<i>A</i>, 605, II 235; <i>Hotho</i>, 204, see also <i>Pfordten</i>, 63). Whereas in the earlier passage Hegel stresses the ways in which the artist is captive of his culture, here he emphasizes the emancipating forces existing within this culture. The modern artist belongs to a social world that sets him free, a world from which he cannot escape and from which he cannot "abstract himself" by 

<b></b>

 an act of will or decision. This is a peculiar predicament. The artist is only bound by conventions to the extent that he so chooses. Reflection emancipates him from inherited tradition, from having to depict this and thus. But precisely because every artistic choice is considered, deliberate—in a word, reflective—freedom is unavoidable: whether the artist decides to adopt inherited forms and subject matter or not, his relation to artistic tradition becomes an expression of his freedom.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  "Reflection" in this context signifies the unavailability of tradition as a given, formative power. The modern artist has to choose anew, inhabit his culture, and root himself in the present: "Only the present is fresh, the rest is paler and paler" (<i>A</i>, 608, II 238; see also <i>Hotho</i>, 199, 200).  </p>

<p>In Hegel's description, however, the social and cultural world which the artist is asked to occupy and make his own is not immediately inspiring. It is, we are told, a world of "prosaic actuality" (<i>A</i>, 196, I 257; <i>Pfordten</i>, 170–71, <i>Hotho</i>, 44, 201). This "prosaic state of affairs," Hegel admits, offers little scope for "ideal conration" (<i>A</i>, 193, I 253; <i>Pfordten</i>, 174). In the "world of today," he explains, "the individual subject may of course act of himself in this or that matter, but still every individual, wherever he may twist or turn  . . .  does not appear himself as the independent, total, and at the same time individual living embodiment of this society, but only as a restricted member of it' (<i>A</i>, 194, I 254–55; <i>Hotho</i>, 87). The "civilized, legal, moral, and political conditions" (<i>A</i>, 193, I 253; <i>Hotho</i>, 88) that shape modern individuals into potentially educable bearers of claims, rights, and obligations also render impossible the task of identifying any one among them as embodiment of the sum total of these conditions. Since there are many ways in which one can be an individual—just as there are many ways in which the modern artist can be who he is—no ideal representation of <i>the</i> modern individual is possible. This adds a further dimension to the idea of artistic freedom and choice identified earlier, namely that modern culture is inherently plural and resistant to unification. There are many different stories that can be said about a culture of individuals, and each of these stories remains provisional or partial with respect to the whole.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Writing in a different context, David Kolb aptly describes this condition of irreducible plurality as one in which "we are strung out within multiple fields of possibility that do not come neatly individuated one by one or as a totality. We can be aware of our rootedness and our identification with ways of thought and life only piecemeal."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The counterpart of the culture of reflection, then, is that no single narrative about modern individuality imposes itself with obvious necessity. The world of institutions that define, nurture, and recognize modern individuality is a prosaic world that is not suited to the heroic and the ideal (<i>A</i>, 194, I 255; <i>Hotho</i>, 85–86). Of course, saying this is also saying that there <i>is</i> one such single narrative, namely the story just given of the birth or constitution of modern individuality. But this is precisely where the creative problem arises in the first place. The peculiar predicament of the modern artist, in Hegel's account, is that the artist is a "<i>tabula rasa</i>," free from traditional constraints on his art (<i>A</i>, 605, II 235; <i>Hotho</i>, 204). This statement of artistic freedom is clearly not an accurate description of specific artistic projects, at least not any with which Hegel might have been acquainted, and it would be a mistake to take it as such. The level of generality of Hegel's discussion at this point suggests that the portrayal of the artist 

<b></b>

 as a <i>tabula rasa</i> has a different function. It helps clarify what is involved in the very aspiration of artistic freedom that becomes possible under conditions of modernity. The picture of a <i>tabula rasa</i> conveys the idea of emancipation from the authority of tradition—this freedom is both the artist's and the culture's, scraping off the markings of tradition is a possibility for the individual only insofar as it is an epochal possibility. Yet this picture also conveys the idea that unless something is impressed on the tablet, it will remain blank. This suggests a more complicated view of artistic practice than was at first visible. Under conditions of modernity, the category of necessity is rendered problematic but it does not evaporate. The artist can freely choose what to present and how, and so he can define anew what is worthy of artistic representation. Through this activity he both affirms his freedom and his bond to his culture. At the same time though, unless we are to imagine the tablet magically inscribing itself, the realization of the artist's choice, and hence of his freedom, requires submission to some end that presents itself as a pressing need and which can be retrospectively recognized as such. The task now is to discover how, by argument or by example, Hegel captures this dual process of artistic freedom and necessitation.  </p>

<p>One pressing need that Hegel identifies as characteristic of art of modern culture is timeliness. Art that is of its time is art that draws from the "common domestic life," the "ordinary civil life" of the people who inhabit this modern world (<i>A</i>, 596, II 224), art made out of material that is everyday, "immanent" and "indigenous" (<i>A</i>, 597, II 225), art, finally, that looks to "the contingency of immediate existence which, taken by itself, is unbeautiful and prosaic" (<i>A</i>, 596, II 223). For an example of such timely art, Hegel reaches back to seventeenth-century Dutch painting. Emphatically resisting the label of "genre painting," he lovingly describes the domestic interiors and tavern scenes, the still lifes, and the landscapes, praising the Dutch artists for choosing the "content of their artistic representations out of their own experience" (<i>A</i>, 169, I 222; <i>Hotho</i>, 200–201).  </p>

<p>Hegel's vindication of the importance of Dutch art has led some commentators to view it as emblematic of his account of modern artistic practice in general. Terry Pinkard, for instance, glosses Hegel's point about prosaic actuality by arguing that "the world of freedom—institutionalized in the prosaic, that is non-aesthetically satisfying world of constitutional law, markets, bourgeois families and the like—is outside the realm of beauty" (<i>GP</i>, 298). He then explains that "in capturing the moments of modern inwardness, of the bourgeois life surrounding us," Dutch art "presents the truth about modern freedom in <i>as aesthetic</i> mode as can be presented" (<i>GP</i>, 299). This qualification, however, simply serves to reinforce the point that the "whole truth" cannot be presented aesthetically and therefore "art cannot matter to us as it once did" (<i>GP</i>, 299). Although starting from a very different account of modernity, Stephen Houlgate reaches a similar conclusion. In Houlgate's account, art undergoes a process of secularization, which contributes to its "growing autonomy" but also to the "relativisation of art's value, because it is only in religion and philosophy that the truth that art intimates comes to be fully revealed."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Consequently, the thematic modesty of Dutch art can be seen to reflect the diminished status of art, its impotence to communicate fully "the 

<b></b>

 truth"; what art can still do is to "afford us a breathing space in which to feel at one with ourselves and with the world."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> </p>

<p>While these two interpretations present very different assessments of modernity, they converge in the view that Hegel's account of modern artistic practice helps to explain his thesis about the status of art in modernity. In other words, both commentators take Hegel's remarks on Dutch art as illustrative of the historical diagnosis of the role of art in the modern world. As a result, both accounts encourage us to search for a lack in modern art. The temptation here is that because we know how the historical narrative ends, we look at Hegel's examples in terms of what art <i>cannot</i> do. This preoccupation leaves largely unexplored his views about what such art <i>can</i> do. And yet it is on this last that we need to focus, if we are to reach a better understanding of his account of modern artistic freedom and necessitation. </p>

<p>The subject matter of timely art, the one that presses itself on the artist who inhabits a free culture as a necessary choice, is, Hegel claims, "<i>Humanus</i>, the universal humanity" (<i>Hotho</i>, 204). What shape or content might be given to such a subject matter is as yet unclear. Here is how Hegel describes the artistic process that leads to this choice of subject matter: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[It is] a withdrawal of man into himself, a descent into his own breast, whereby art strips away from itself all fixed restriction to a specific range of content and treatment, and makes <i>Humanus</i> its new holy of holies: i.e. the depths and heights of the human heart as such, mankind in its joys and sorrows, its strivings, deeds, and fates. Herewith the artist acquires his subject matter in himself and is the human spirit actually self-determining.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>A</i>, 607, II 237–38; also <i>Hotho</i>, 42, 204)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">One way of understanding the meaning of the "withdrawal of man into himself" is as a turn towards a subject matter that treats of the familiar and the everyday (<i>Hotho</i>, 200). This interpretation is confirmed by the example Hegel uses of Dutch art which he praises precisely for its unheroic virtues. But even granting its exemplary status in Hegel's narrative, seventeenth-century Dutch art cannot but be one constituent in the schema of the art of modern time. The elevation of <i>Humanus</i> into subject matter clearly allows for as much variety in conception and execution as there are "depths and heights" in the human heart.  </p>

<p>What then would an artistic presentation of "the human spirit actually self-determining" look like? One recent attempt to answer this question is Robert Pippin's discussion of twentieth-century abstract art from a Hegelian perspective.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Pippin's interpretation is embedded in his own strong reading of modernity, which supplements Hegel's scattered remarks in the lectures to create a rather more robust and systematic view on aesthetic modernism than is tenable on textual evidence alone. More importantly, as I argue shortly, it presents a view of Hegelian modernity that is fundamentally Promethean: human beings are at home in the world because they recognize this world as one of their own making. What is lost in this reconstruction is the ambiguity of Hegel's account of modernity. To appreciate this and the way this account leads on to complex issues about how modern individuals experience their freedom, I want to start with a 

<b></b>

 painting that fits chronologically with Hegel's lectures, Géricault's <i>Raft of the Medusa</i>. What is especially interesting for our purposes is the availability of extensive documentation concerning the topic, construction, and reception history of the painting, which allows us to consider in the particular the elements of creative process we have until now considered only in the abstract.  </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
2. "Nothing Above, Nothing Below"—Géricault  
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Even by the standards of nineteenth-century painting, the <i>Raft of the Medusa</i> is conspicuously large, measuring 491 x 716cm. The res are double life-size. The painting shows a crew of men aboard a raft half-submerged in dark waters. Some of them appear dead or dying. The majority are depicted heaving themselves in a great pyramid as they hail a passing ship barely visible in the distance. Waves rising behind the raft bar a clear view of the horizon. Heavy clouds cover two thirds of the sky. There is little color: the greenish black and brown of the waves, the brown hues for the raft and the sail, the red in the head-cover of the old man in the middle ground, a red waistband and headscarf worn by the res on the right, a red cloth waived by the man at the far right top of the painting. Touches of white render cloth, flesh, and sea-foam. Diffuse light from an unseen source does not dispel the overall impression of darkness. The composition leads the eye across the canvas as a series of triangles compete for attention: a dominant triangle of lit res with their backs turned to the viewer is counterbalanced by a triangular dark cloth, perhaps part of a makeshift shelter aboard the raft that casts its shadow over a cluster of res at its base. The exaggerated sinuosity of those who lift themselves against the stormy sea contrasts with the abandon of the lifeless res in the foreground.  </p>

<p>The original title chosen by Géricault was <i>Scene of a Shipwreck</i>. When the painting was first exhibited, in the Salon of 1819, all who saw it recognized the source of Géricault's subject matter. In June 1816, a frigate, <i>Medusa</i>, sailed from France together with three other smaller ships in the direction of Senegal. It was shipwrecked off the coast of West Africa. Two of the survivors published an account of their ordeal in 1817 and Géricault started working on the painting the next year. His choice was careful and methodical: this was a subject matter he considered suitable for an ambitious painting with which he could win the <i>Prix de Rome</i>. His well-documented preparations for the painting—his interviews with the survivors, the raft he reconstructed in his studio, his sketches of different scenes from the shipwreck, his drawings and paintings of dead and dying people in hospitals and morgues—record the steps in an ongoing process of deliberation that concludes in the rendering we have in the final painting.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Hegel says of the modern artist that "from the very beginning, before he embarks on production, his great free soul must know and possess its own ground" (<i>A</i>, 606, II 236). But what is the "ground" Géricault sought to possess? First let us note that he did not choose to paint a classical or biblical subject—the only subjects traditionally deemed suitable for ambitious painting. He depicted instead a shipwreck that was unavoidably 

<b></b>

 <i>particular</i>. What made it so was not just the events related in the survivors' account. The shipwreck had caused a political scandal. The majority of the ship's passengers, around 140 of them, were set adrift on an unnavigable raft. After thirteen days without provisions, fifteen men were finally rescued by a passing ship. The account published by the two survivors, which included tales of madness, murder, and cannibalism, was immediately suppressed because of its indictment of the officers in charge who had failed in their duties to the passengers. The officers were among those members of the nobility who, upon the restoration of monarchy in France, were invited to occupy key positions in government and administration, thus debarring from service experienced imperial officers.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  If the immediate political context is that of the restoration of the French monarchy, the broader political context is that of Western European colonialism: Senegal had only fallen back into French hands the year before <i>Medusa</i>'s trip in 1815. Apart from the officers and crew, aboard the <i>Medusa</i> was a dispatch intended to man the garrison of the newly acquired colony, engineers and topographers, doctors and chemists for the hospital, scribes and administrators, and settlers attracted by prospects of a better life. These are the people Géricault chooses to depict: ordinary, unheroic men. His material is drawn from "the contingency of immediate existence," but there is nothing here of the quiet everydayness of Dutch painting. We do not see doctors, chemists, scribes, administrators, or families of settlers: we see the survivors and the dead. We see those who were not thrown overboard, those who perhaps killed to survive, those whose strength and capacity for endurance kept them alive.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  But we do not see grotesques either. We see the artist's hand composing, arranging, idealizing, using the idiom of historical painting to represent these men and so to show his audience that what he chose to depict is worth depicting. The scale is grand, the features of the men ennobled, their musculature obeys classical proportions. Here again is an artist occupying his ground, subjecting ideal conration to the demands of his subject matter, the depiction of ordinary men in circumstances turned awry. These observations prompt the question: what exactly <i>is</i> Géricault's subject matter? I want to examine two different answers to this question: one given by Thomas Crow, the other by Peter Weiss.  </p>

<p>Crow draws our attention to what he calls the "paradox of the Raft," that is, the way its "colossal size both creates and demands a closeness of approach that is normally the province of an easel painting" (<i>EMA</i>, 292). He begins by pointing out that what we see is not emaciated, particular, identifiable individuals, but rather bodies "painted with all the generality demanded by tradition" (<i>EMA</i>, 292). These classically formed bodies unite to become a single body of humanity:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The chain of mingled bodies, uniting the races of Europe and Africa, becomes the equivalent of one single body in a state of transformation; its internal quickening proceeds from the group of moribund res at the left across and upwards through rekindled alertness at the center  . . .  to the ecstatic vitality of the frantic signaling at the pinnacle of the group.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  </p>
	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>EMA</i>, 292) 

<b></b>
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->


</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The intimacy we experience is born out of this egalitarian vision of humanity: classicist idealization is put to the service of depicting a "non-hierarchical vision of social purpose" and of conveying a message of social transformation. Although Crow's interpretation skillfully weaves pictorial analysis with research in the political context of the painting, it remains overly affirmative. Crow grounds the socio-political ideal of equality in the pictorial conceit that the many res form a chain that signifies a single body of humanity. In order to discern this single body, however, too great an emphasis must be placed on the compositional <i>unity</i> of the painting. This requires that we ignore the demands of differentiation placed on us by the depicted "mingled bodies" that represent the "races of Europe and Africa."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  It also requires that we fail to acknowledge the dynamic lines, made of touches of light, limbs and bodies, which convey the impression of something broken or at best "<i>urgently</i> unified."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Finally, and most importantly, the uplifting symbolism of the upward movement of a body "in a state of transformation" places the <i>Raft</i> in an unconvincingly simplistic interpretative framework: the unifying frame becomes a single movement from darkness to light, from death to life, from despair to hope.   </p>

<p>An alternative interpretation, which stresses the dark and fragmentary character of the painting, is offered by Peter Weiss. Weiss, or more accurately, Weiss's narrator in<i> The Aesthetic of Resistance</i>, emphasizes the impression of gloom created by Géricault's subdued palette. He describes how the "intensely darkened, dull and patchy" colors give the painting an almost abstract quality so that "yellowish, bluish, or greenish hues" emerge out of a "seemingly monochrome pictorial surface."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The darkened tones and pale limbs suggest pain and abandonment rather than hope and excitement. Weiss uses the aesthetic experience of depicted pain to describe a crossing of boundaries between painter, viewer and work of art:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Only pain and loss were discernible in the violently unified composition, it was as if coats of colour, encrusted and scorified, peel away all that is documentary and graspable as such, leaving in the end only the personal catastrophe of the artist..</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>DAW</i>, 472)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Pigment is here presented as the medium through which the particular and the documentary is sloughed off, to leave only pain and loss represented on the canvas. This striking account of the <i>Raft</i> forms part of a particular aesthetic which Weiss seeks to develop through his first-person narrator and which depends on a process of recognition of suffering that leads to the experience of an aesthetic overcoming of "oppression and loss" (<i>DAW</i>, 486): the depicted pain becomes a vehicle for the expression of the painter's own anguish and despair.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The intimacy on which Crow remarked becomes here the intimacy of an encounter between two subjects: artist and viewer. On Weiss's account, the unifying frame is the "artist's soul," and it is this in the end that we see as subject matter. While it is deeply resonant, this interpretation goes too far in minimizing the ostensible subject matter —"coats of colour  . . .  peel back all that was documentary"—in order to give us a glimpse of Géricault's soul. The depicted men adrift a raft become a stepping stone into an inner world that artist and viewer share. This seems 

<b></b>

 too restrictive and subjective a unifying frame for a painting that was so meticulously documented and composed, so deliberately prepared and displayed to the public.  </p>

<p>Crow recognizes something that Weiss does not: idealization signals that what we see is not just these particular men on this particular shipwreck. The painting is historically rooted but not merely illustrative of historical incident. And Weiss sees something that Crow does not: the unity of the painting is precarious, pulled apart by shards of lit limbs. Chromatically and compositionally, the life-affirming elements of the painting are in constant battle with darkness and violence.  </p>

<p>Out of these conflicting interpretations we can construct a more dynamic interpretation of the <i>Raft</i>. On one side, we see the dully lit pyramid of men, culminating with a man lifting a black sailor, who waves at the distant ship. At the opposite end, we see a motionless re, mainly in the shadow, holding the dead body of his young companion. Behind him looms the dark triangle of the makeshift refuge, and, beyond this, to his left a huge wave menacing to engulf the raft. The man is shown absorbed in contemplation, unstirred by the commotion among the rest of his companions as if unmoved by the prospect of rescue. In his stillness he is as dead to his surroundings. When we look at the <i>Raft</i>, we see the living and the hopeful turning away from the dead and the dying and in the same pictorial and thematic space a living re who looks away from those who call for help and hope for rescue. His indifference to survival can be interpreted as showing grief, or despair, at the brutal necessities of the struggle to stay alive.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Structurally though, in terms of the conceptual articulation of the painting, this inert but living presence who holds the dead but is himself, in his stillness, as dead to his surroundings, forms a counterweight to the raised, vital re signaling to the distant ship. In piecing these elements together, we can say that Géricault depicts the struggle for survival of ordinary men and the uncertainties of the outcome (the ship they hail is far enough in the distance and the sea menacing enough to withhold from us, the viewers, the satisfaction that rescue is imminent). But more than this, he is able to show us something that is part of, and yet in important ways outside, the compositional whole; he gives us a picture of death in life.  </p>

3. Holding the dead—Hegel after Géricault 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>From the vantage point of Hegel's remarks on modern art it is possible to see in the <i>Raft of the Medusa</i> the "strivings, deeds, and fates" of <i>Humanus</i>. But we also see uncertainty and possibly also indifference about the outcome in the struggle for survival. While the contained complexity of the painting gives shape to the idea of artistic freedom, its dark vision of the withdrawal to the self compels us to look further into this process, to discover the character and circumstances of modern freedom.  </p>

<p>A useful starting point is the relation to artistic tradition that underpins Hegel's concept of artistic freedom. Unbound by inherited choices, the modern artist is compelled (or free) to make his own. In doing so, he can turn to and appropriate elements of his artistic inheritance. This act of appropriation indicates that the relation to tradition is 

<b></b>

 not one of unproblematic belonging. There is an interesting parallel between this and the relation to nature described in Pippin's Hegelian defence of aesthetic modernism. Pippin interprets Hegel's remarks on art in terms of a broader thesis concerning modern "independence from natural determination" which, he argues, is in turn reflected in the "self-images manifested in art" ("HHA," 214).<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Pippin's broader thesis has a philosophical as well as a social dimension: "the decisive modern event was the end of the authority of nature as such" ("HHA," 227). This is the lesson of modernity: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Normative claims to knowledge, rectitude, spiritual life, or even claims <i>to be making art</i>, or that <i>that was good</i>, are now made with the self-consciousness that the authority of such claims can always be challenged and defeated  . . . . To put it in a different way: an enduring continuous human life is not an event or occurrence, a happening, like others. Lives don't just happen; must be actively led, steered, guided, we now for the first time fully appreciate.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	("HHA," 221)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Pippin's historical thesis about the occurrence of the "modern event" has its correlative in a emancipatory teleology: "we have broken free of dependence on such sensible images not so much because of <i>their</i> inadequacy as because of <i>our</i> having made ourselves independent of them" ("HHA," 214).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Pippin's bold reading of modernism in terms of a Hegelian-inspired view of modernity takes in its stride the familiar <i>topoi</i> of a number of post-Enlightenment, post-Kantian philosophical projects. But if we want to discover what exactly is involved in what Pippin calls "the modern event," we need to look beyond the bare assertion of cognitive and moral independence and consider the activity that is involved in "making ourselves independent." Central to his account is the idea that human lives are actively led, rather than suffered. This leads him to interpret strongly the notion of "self-legislation" as "self-authorship." From this also follows the second element of emancipation from external authority, the idea that the choices that make up these active lives are only provisionally justifiable, because the reasons that guide them are always defeasible. Coming to see that one's compass is only good until further notice is a consequence of the identification of the source of normative authority with an intramundane subject, a historical, contingently located "we."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  So the content of "making ourselves independent" is good, bad, or indifferent according to whatever local criteria apply. The only norm that matters is the principle of self-authorship itself, which is what makes the boast and pride of modern individuals.  </p>

<p>There are clearly elements in Pippin's picture of modernity that resonate with Hegel's account, or, at least, a plausibly Hegelian one. The key problem is Pippin's over-emphatic endorsement of subjective legislation; in order to guarantee its autonomy, its independence from nature, he presents it as an act of self-creation <i>ex nihilo</i>. A further question concerns the assurance that "more and more gradually" we know what we are doing. This suggests that we make substantive gains. However, as we saw, while we may be in position to choose one local bit of self-legislation over another, we do so only by relying on whatever local criteria "we" have to hand. This is not sufficient to sustain a substantive progressive teleology. So we are left with a formal gain, namely a gradual realization that there is no other source of normativity but an intramundane 

<b></b>

 "we." Reflective self-awareness sums up our gains in knowledge and freedom. Nothing further is said, or promised, or can be said or promised, about the ways we treat each other. We may then want to shift our focus away from the progressivist story, which is ambiguous at the very least, and on the idea of self-authorship. I want to propose an alternative reading that takes seriously the idea of "withdrawal to self" but makes better sense of the materials Hegel presents us with.  </p>

<p>To start with, let us articulate more fully the standpoint of emancipation from external authority. As we saw earlier, erasing the markings of tradition leaves us not just without tradition but with nothing. Hegel's image of the modern artist as a <i>tabula rasa</i> suggests that in order to realize his freedom, the artist must submit to some end that presents itself, and can be retrospectively "read," as pressing, as necessitating. In the moral context, we may say of an end that is necessitating in the requisite fashion that it is good without qualification. The question is can such an idea, an idea that captures the force of normative necessitation, be reconcilable with what Hegel says of freedom? Let us look again at the puzzling description of the modern predicament in the <i>Lectures on Fine Art</i>. The art that depicts the "withdrawal of man into himself," Hegel writes, does not just strip away from itself "all fixed restriction to a specific range of content and treatment," but, significantly, it "makes <i>Humanus</i> its new holy of holies" (see above, p. 612). Kant's discussion of holiness in the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i> offers us one way of thinking about the extra-artistic transformation to which Hegel alludes here: "Man is certainly unholy enough, but humanity in his person must be holy to him  . . .  he is the subject of the moral law which is holy, because of the autonomy of his freedom."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Here the idea of the holiness of humanity, which appears already as a command, is predicated on the idea that human beings are subject to the moral law. It is true that we are subject to the law only insofar as we are free, but it is also true that we are free, in the sense of autonomous, insofar as we are subject to the law. What I want to show now is how this double aspect of human freedom informs Hegel's account of modernity, creating a morally and epistemically ambiguous landscape. </p>

<p>In a passage in the<i> Encyclopedia Logic</i>, Hegel paints a striking image of freedom: "This feeling that we are all our own is characteristic of free thought—of that voyage into the open, where nothing is below us or above us, and we stand in solitude with ourselves alone" (<i>E</i>, 52, 98).<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The context is a discussion of the historical fate of different metaphysical systems. Hegel argues that historically thought has sought to find "a firm and fast footing" (<i>E</i>, 51, 97) in concepts such as "God," "the Soul," or "the World." In a few very densely packed sentences, he suggests that these foundational efforts fail. In the appended note, in which the quoted remark occurs, he elaborates the point by comparing the degree to which different schools of thought rely on unexamined givens as their foundations. His examples are from ancient, scholastic, and modern thought. Scholasticism, he claims, accepts "its facts" as "dogma from the authority of the Church" <i>(E</i>, 51, 97<i>).</i> Greek philosophy is, by comparison, freer because it rejects "mythology and its fancies" and presupposes "nothing but the heaven above and the earth around" (<i>E</i>, 52, 98). The contrast here is presumably between medieval theism and ancient naturalism—or between "God" and "the World." The moderns, Hegel 

<b></b>

 claims, have a chance fully to free themselves from such foundational supports and to become "thoroughly at home." It is at this point that he seeks to convey how it feels to achieve such freedom with an image of being "all on our own," where "nothing is below us or above us, and we stand in solitude with ourselves alone" (<i>E</i>, 52, 98). There is a parallel here with his description of modern artistic freedom. The artist is no longer bound by tradition—he has no firm footing in it, we might say. The thinker is no longer bound by things above and below—not even the "heaven above and the earth around" of the ancients. The image of the <i>tabula rasa</i> is replaced here by the image of a void, of "nothing above and nothing below." But, how can thought be "at home" in this solitary encounter with the unknown? This picture of homeliness is neither comfortable nor comforting. But perhaps this is precisely its point: namely to alert us moderns to the power of fantasies about a world that is tamed and familiar and made up of a prosaic, unbeautiful everyday. This too might be a fanciful myth, Hegel suggests, one of those ideas "we moderns  . . .  find extremely difficult to overstep" (<i>E</i>, 51, 98). The clues he gives us about homeliness further in the book render yet more remote the prospect of peaceful inhabiting:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The "I" is as it were the crucible and the fire which consumes the loose plurality of sense and reduces it to unity. This is the process which Kant calls pure apperception  . . . . This view has at least the merit of giving a correct expression to the nature of all consciousness. The tendency of all man's endeavours is to understand the world, to appropriate and subdue it to himself: and to this end the positive reality of the world must be as it were crushed and pounded, in other words, idealised.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>E</i>, 69, 118)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The void of "nothing below us or above us" is an image of a world that withdraws from us as a given reality in the process of becoming "idealized," that is, in the process of becoming known in relation to a consciousness. The violence of Hegel's description of the loss of the world as given and the gain of the world as known should give us at least some pause when we consider the promised gains in freedom and self-knowledge that are placed within our (modern) reach.  </p>

<p>What is the relevance of these images of solitude and of destruction to the Hegelian view of modernity? Central to the self-understanding of modernity is emancipation from those external sources of authority—for instance "God" or "the World"—that are judged, from the modern point of view, to be essential ingredients of points of view outgrown by modernity. This opens a way of conceiving modern freedom in positive terms as making ourselves at home in the world. To be "at home" is to be among recognizable, familiar surroundings. Accordingly, the normative aspiration captured by the idea of being at home creates, not unreasonably, the expectation that we can gradually come to see the world to be in our image, shaped in accordance to our rules. Hegel's depiction of full freedom as an encounter with a void hints at the emptiness of this element of modern self-understanding. This is not to deny that we give shape to our world, quite the contrary, on Hegel's account, any cognitive encounter is a metaphorical crushing and pounding of the world to fit the shapes of our consciousness. But this is not a prerogative of the moderns, rather it is a feature of "all man's endeavours" to 

<b></b>

 understand the world. The modern twist to this story is that understanding the world is, or must be, also a <i>self</i>-understanding. The reason why modern narratives that take us from emancipation from external authority to the requirements of self-authorship end with a void, a blank tablet, is because they pass in silence, or, in Pippin's telling, merely instrumentalize the crushing and pounding of modern self-understanding.  </p>

<p>To recover what is missing, we may once again look to the creative burdens of the modern artist. As we saw, the artist faces a demand, which is issued from and is distinctive to his culture, namely to elevate <i>Humanus</i>, the universal humanity, into subject matter. He can only realize his freedom by taking on this task. Extrapolating from this, we can say that modern freedom has similarly a double aspect: the internal aspect, which allows the agent to see his will as his own and therefore as expressive of his freedom, and an aspect of subjection to the norm that gives shape to this will and which appears, for this purpose, as externally necessitating. The fantasy of home-making elides precisely this external aspect. Hegel's word for this last is "death." In the <i>Phenomenology</i>, Hegel argues that the work of the understanding is the dissolution of the non-actual (<i>PS</i>, 18, 36). He continues:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Death, if that is what we want to call this non-actuality, is of all things the most dreadful, and to hold fast what is dead requires the greatest strength . . .  But the life of Spirit is not the life that shrinks from death and keeps itself untouched by devastation, but rather life that endures it and maintains itself in it.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>PS</i>, 19, 36)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This passage contains the tough core of Hegel's emancipatory message: the life of Spirit depends on acknowledging precisely that which appears external or alien. In other words, modern freedom—the "human spirit actually self-determining"—does not come with a lighter normative burden than, say, self-conceptions that are grounded in God or the World. Insofar as they are ours, the normative structures that express such freedom, make up a home for us, but insofar as they are normative, they determine the rules to which we must submit. Hegel's account of how we become modern invites us to consider our post-Enlightenment, post-Kantian legacy not only in terms of cognitive and moral independence, but also in terms of the hard work of holding the dead.  </p>

An early account of this basic narrative of Hegelian modernity can be found in Edward Caird, <i>Hegel</i> (William Blackwood and Sons: Edinburgh and London, 1883), although probably the most familiar version is found in Marx, who adapts it to his own project; see for instance the discussion of "alienated labor" in the "Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844" in R. C. Tucker ed., <i>The Marx-Engels Reader</i> (New York and London: W. W. Norton and Co, 1978), 70–81.

"The great artist today," Hegel says, "needs in particular the free development of the spirit; in that development all superstition, and all faith which remains restricted to determinate forms of vision and presentation, is degraded to mere aspects and features" (<i>A</i>, 606, II 236). There are different "modes of treatment" of his material that the modern artist may choose to adopt form the past, he "may associate himself with the classical age and with still more ancient times; to be a follower of Homer, even if the last one, is fine, and productions reflecting the medieval veering to romantic art will have their merits too" (<i>A</i>, 607–8, II 238).  </p>

It has been suggested that the re of the old man holding the dead body is to be interpreted as an indirect reference to Ugolino, who in Dante's Commedia is condemned for eating his children. This would then be an allusion to reported cannibalism onboard the raft. Another interesting parallel is with the theme of filial piety, usually represented with the re of Aeneas carrying his father Anchisses on his back after the sacking of Troy. The theme is used in Girodet's <i>Scene from a Deluge</i> and also in Regnaut's <i>Deluge</i>. In Géricault's painting, the young man does not carry the old but the other way round. Géricault depicts an inverted world where the old survive and the young die, where the links of familial or traditional loyalty are severed and old and young are cast adrift a threatening sea. </p>

<p id="lead">Those who acknowledge any relationship between Hollywood film and F. Scott Fitzgerald's fiction generally confine themselves to claiming either that Hollywood's demands and seductions interfered with Fitzgerald's already strained efforts to write "serious" fiction or that Hollywood studios have mostly botched their adaptations of his work.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  However, <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i> shows that the relationship between film and Fitzgerald's fiction is more complicated and more important than generally acknowledged both for his work and, more broadly, for fiction written during the cultural ascendancy of Hollywood film. Although in recent decades scholars have generally seen <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>as a tonally incoherent, failed novel and therefore have given it relatively little attention, I would argue that its very tonal incoherence actually makes it worth studying.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Once one understands film's previously unacknowledged but crucial role in provoking and conditioning that incoherence, one can recognize the unappreciated extent to which Hollywood film shaped Fitzgerald's "serious" fiction beginning quite early in his career. Indeed, as a hyper-precise representational medium, as a purveyor of American fantasies, as a codified array of formal devices, and as a growing cultural power, Hollywood film not only structures the thematic and diegetic registers of <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>but also significantly shapes its literary techniques. </p>

<p>Though this article focuses on <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, film's influence both on Fitzgerald's technique and on the habits of vision shaping his technique have much broader implications for the study of American fiction. If indeed film did open up new 

<b></b>

 techniques for Fitzgerald well before he ever worked in Hollywood—and if (as in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>) film did so without his even noticing or at least without his being able to treat the influence as an opportunity rather than a problem—then it becomes both sensible and productive to pursue the possibility that film contributed substantially to the formal and phenomenological shifts discernible in American "literary" fiction written in the first decades of the twentieth century, especially after the emergence and rapid consolidation of the feature film (say, 1917 onward). We may well discover that we should understand film not merely as a cultural threat to literary fiction or even as a set of techniques that forward-looking authors might have adapted to their own purposes but also, more fundamentally, as an especially influential crystallization of new habits of vision and cognition made not only available but in fact inevitable by the changing cultural and technological landscape of early twentieth-century America.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> </p>

<p>In particular, such a reappraisal of film's influence suggests the value of understanding American fictional modernism in terms of the phenomenological shifts both promoted and evidenced by the developing American (particularly Hollywood) cinema. Admittedly, whether Fitzgerald is a modernist is a vexed question. His avowed literary priorities, his public persona, and the mass appeal of so much of his work would certainly seem to place him outside the literary high American modernism of, say, Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, or William Faulkner. It is therefore tempting to finesse the question by bestowing upon him a more particular label, perhaps "Jazz-Age writer." However, Fitzgerald's work, especially his early novels <i>This Side of Paradise</i>  and <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, clearly demonstrates his interest in the formal strategies characteristic of literary modernism, and it seems important to stress that at least some of those strategies emerged from American mass culture (here, Hollywood film) at least as much as they emerged in opposition to it. </p>

<p>Many scholars and general readers alike see Hollywood as having influenced Fitzgerald's fiction primarily by distracting him from writing more of it and by cheapening what he did manage to produce, and that mistaken impression seems to come from understanding Fitzgerald as the uneasy marriage of what John Dos Passos called in 1945 "two divergent halves."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In this view, Fitzgerald's better half struggled to produce "serious" fiction (mostly his novels), while his lesser half profited handsomely by pumping out ephemeral short stories and bad film scripts.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Scholars who accept this view of the divided Fitzgerald concede that Fitzgerald needed to sell commercial work in order to make a living while he wrote his serious fiction, but they also argue that his high wages came at a high artistic price. For example, one critic claims that Fitzgerald's attempts from 1919 to 1925 to write short stories that could easily be made into movies had the consequence of producing fiction larded with improbable plot twists, "ineffectual humorous comments referring to Hollywood filmmaking," and "unnecessarily drawn-out pictorial scenes."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Others claim that Fitzgerald's stints in Hollywood from 1927 until his death in 1941 prove that working there "was degrading of the human spirit."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> </p>

<p>This contempt for Hollywood film, veiled or otherwise, has further distracted attention from film's more fundamental influence on Fitzgerald's formal techniques by encouraging a widespread tendency to regard all filmic adaptations of Fitzgerald's novels 

<b></b>

 with suspicion and to treat as potentially praiseworthy only those adaptations that bring his novels to the screen "with a true sense of fidelity to the original source material."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Although critics judging by the yardstick of fidelity (or "authenticity") occasionally find that a given adaptation manages to live up to the Fitzgerald originals, more likely they will write about Hollywood's "carelessness and outright tawdriness" leading to "a Technicolor tragedy" that proves "Hollywood's inability to filmically replicate the written word."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  But fidelity or lack thereof is a side issue. In order to understand how Hollywood shaped <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>(and Fitzgerald's other fiction), one has to look beyond both Fitzgerald's time in Hollywood and the adaptation of his novels. After all, even those scholars most dismissive either of film per se or of specific filmed adaptations nonetheless acknowledge that Fitzgerald "was fascinated by Hollywood even as he was repelled by it" and that his fiction "exhibits many filmic qualities."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In fact, in reading <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, if we take Fitzgerald's fascination with film seriously, we quickly discover that it extends beyond an interest in "sumptuous sets [and] detailed costumes" and stray references to movie stars.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Arc-Light Fiction: Realism, Romance, and the Anxiety of Social Change 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>I accept the scholarly consensus that the novel's tonal incoherence arises from Fitzgerald's inability to decide whether to satirize or to lament the decline of his protagonist's privileged class, but I argue not only that film contributes far more directly to that incoherence than generally acknowledged but also that film inflects Fitzgerald's own technique even—or especially—in those parts of the novel in which film menaces the literary values that Fitzgerald as implied author champions. I therefore spend much of the article establishing film's surprisingly complex and pervasive contributions to the novel's plot and theme. In particular, I show both that film is a crucial and overdetermined nexus in the novel's growing anxiety about social change and that its anxiety both partially derives from and significantly engenders its overt and increasing wariness of film's growing cultural power. That wariness marks the best spots to look for clear instances of the profound but subtle ways in which film shapes the novel's formal features. Indeed, only in the context of that wariness can the extent and significance of the novel's film-inflected technique become clearly perceptible and demonstrable as such. </p>

<p>In her excellent work on the connections between D. W. Griffith's heroines and the female characters in <i>Tender is the Night</i> , Ruth Prigozy has noted in that later novel two of the same features that I want to stress in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>: an awareness of "the moving pictures as a major occupation" and an interest in "the dissolution and degeneration of a privileged class."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Indeed, in her attentiveness to popular culture's "particularly strong impact on Fitzgerald throughout his life," Prigozy makes in passing a crucial point about the simultaneous modern skepticism and old-fashioned melodrama of <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>. Noting Fitzgerald's deep admiration for—and saturation in—D. W. Griffith's work, Prigozy writes, 

<b></b>

 </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Fitzgerald's old-fashioned melodramatic scenes in <i>This Side of Paradise</i>  and <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>, as well as countless stories presented in a thoroughly modern style, could lead one to comment as Aaron Latham does of the earlier novel: "He took his lifelike modern novel and turned it into a gaslight drama which would have been more at home back in the nineties."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">While Prigozy helpfully suggests the complicated nexus of melodrama and modernity in Fitzgerald's fiction, more recent film scholarship by Rick Altman, Linda Williams, Ben Singer, and Miriam Hansen has suggested that we can understand Griffith's melodramas and film melodramas in general not as cultural products opposed to early-twentieth-century technological and cultural modernity but rather as part of cinema's vital role in developing audiences' sensory and affective adaptation to modernity.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> </p>

<p>It is in that light that I wish to consider what Prigozy calls the "melodramatic" (Fitzgerald would have called it the "romantic") character of much of <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>. Even if one were to grant that "Griffith offered his audiences a vision that served as a balm to an age of profound stress and anxiety," one would have to say that <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>does no such thing.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Above all else, Fitzgerald's vexed relationship to his protagonists and their fate is overwhelmingly likely to exacerbate any such readerly stress and anxiety. Likewise, even if one were to accept Latham's description of <i>This Side of Paradise</i> as a "gaslight drama," one would nonetheless have to treat <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> as a very different kind of novel. It doesn't nostalgically transform modern stories into older ones but rather enacts a complicated and corrosively unresolved clash between modernity and a way of life imagined in nostalgic reaction against the very experience of that modernity. </p>

<p>Indeed, rather than as a "gaslight drama," one might see <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> as "arc-light fiction," as a novel in which modernity encroaches upon and undermines the priorities and traditions of what Latham and Prigozy designate "gaslight drama." We can see this very clearly in an allegorical interlude at the beginning of the novel. Directly before this interlude, the novel's blueblood protagonist Anthony Patch is sitting in his luxurious apartment, enjoying the city from the apparent safety of his wealth. Although he lives in a thoroughly modern city, his values are those of an older world because his inherited wealth creates a social and sensory buffer between him and the city. He cannot yet imagine the looming world war or the incipient dissolution and degeneration of his privileged class. For example, the elevated trains' rumbling provides a faint note of change and danger, but Anthony cannot take that danger seriously; the noise merely reminds him of "a fantastic romance he had lately read in which cities had been bombed from aerial trains." For him, the el and the "continued low blur of auto horns from Fifth Avenue" seem unimportant, even pleasant, because "his own street was silent and he was safe here from all threat of life  . . .  safe, safe!" In fact, Anthony experiences the modern city as a sort of domesticated sublime, an improvement on mere nature: "The arc-light shining into his window seemed for this hour like the moon, only brighter and more beautiful than the moon."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The novel, of course, proceeds to eliminate that sense of safety. And film is central to that elimination. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>We get the first real suggestions of film's importance to the destruction of Anthony's privileged safety in the allegorical birth of Beauty interlude that immediately follows this mention of the arc light. Fitzgerald's use of the term "arc-light" prepares us for those suggestions. Arc lights would have been familiar to Fitzgerald's readers not only as streetlamps but also as lights commonly used on film sets.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  And if the arc light by itself doesn't get the reader thinking about film, Fitzgerald's header for the birth of Beauty interlude should. He calls it "A FLASH-BACK IN PARADISE."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  This interlude, in which eternal Beauty and an incorporeal Voice discuss what form Beauty will take in her next mortal incarnation, sets up the connections between film and the novel's central conflict between satire and idealization. The Voice tells as-yet incorporeal Beauty, "At first it was thought that you would go this time as an actress in the motion pictures but, after all, it's not advisable" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 29). At this point in the novel, we don't know why it would be inadvisable because we don't yet know that Beauty will take the form of socialite Gloria Gilbert, Anthony's eventual love interest and wife. At this point, we haven't yet seen Gloria and Anthony drain the beauty and money out of each other's lives until they find themselves completely disenchanted with one another and nearly bankrupted by their protracted legal appeal, pursued jointly against his grandfather's estate regarding his lost inheritance. In short, we don't yet know that the novel chronicles the destruction of both this incarnation of Beauty and the privileged class in which and for which it appears, and we don't know that film and the cultural and technological forces that it symbolizes will wreak that destruction. </p>

<p>The novel's tonal incoherence and self-contradictions emerge because Fitzgerald never decides whether the destruction of safety and Beauty by film and all that it stands for is cause for celebration or mourning. We can see this ambivalence in the novel's persistent inability to settle into either realist or romantic mode. (The terms "realism" and "romance" have a long and contentious history in literary criticism; I use them here in accordance with Fitzgerald's own formulations in the early and mid-1920s.) In a letter written while he was still working on <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, Fitzgerald draws a sharp distinction between realism and romance. He writes, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Up to this year the literary people of any pretensions—Mencken, Cabell, Wharton, Drieser (<i>sic</i>), Hergeshiemer (<i>sic</i>), Cather and Charles Norris have been more or less bonded together in the t against intolerance and stupidity but I think that a split is due. On the romantic side Cabell, I suppose, would maintain that life has a certain glamor that detailed reporting—especially this reporting of the small mid-western town—can not (<i>sic</i>) convey to paper. On the realistic side Drieser (<i>sic</i>) would probably maintain that romanticism tends immediatly (<i>sic</i>) to deteriorate to the Zane Grey—Rupert Hughes level. . . .<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In Fitzgerald's letters and fiction, romance often requires the creation of an illusion.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  His version of realism, on the other hand, refuses the seductions of illusion in order to scrutinize the object hidden in and distorted by glamor's glow; as such, Fitzgerald's realism almost inevitably involves social critique and the debunking of myth.  </p>

<p>Although the birth of Beauty interlude in many ways seems inherently "realist" (debunking) because it asks readers to imagine "<i>the unity </i>[of soul, spirit, and body]<i> sought </i>

<b></b>

 <i>for by philosophers through many centuries</i>" in the form of "a ragtime kid, a flapper, a jazz-baby, and a baby vamp" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 31), beneath the whimsical irony we find the conflicted desires that both animate the novel and contribute to its deep ambivalence about its protagonists. No matter how ugly Anthony and Gloria's behavior and beliefs become, Fitzgerald refuses to deny the beauty of their illusions. Though he satirizes the ignorance and denial underlying Anthony's romantic tendencies, he also strives to show how those tendencies make Anthony attractive and, through him, make Gloria glorious. Particularly in the early parts of the novel, Anthony's illusions give them both a glow; Anthony for having them, Gloria for abetting them. Fifty pages or so after the birth of Beauty, we find a passage that in a purely realist novel would be tonally ironic that nonetheless registers as perfectly sincere: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Out of the deep sophistication of Anthony an understanding formed, nothing atavistic or obscure, indeed scarcely physical at all, an understanding remembered from the romancings of many generations of minds that as she talked and caught his eyes and turned her lovely head, she moved him as he had never been moved before. The sheath that held her soul had assumed significance—that was all. She was a sun, radiant, frowning, gathering light and storing it—then after an eternity pouring forth in a glance, the fragment of a sentence, to that part of him that cherished all beauty and all illusion.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>B&amp;D</i>, 73)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Here, Fitzgerald clearly identifies Gloria as Beauty's avatar, and he makes Anthony's romance with her the power source of all the novel's romance. Such beauty, he implies, like all beauty, may ultimately be illusion, but in this passage at least, illusion has no negative valence. Indeed, while the novel may in realist mode tear apart those illusions, it does so with palpable regret. When Anthony and Gloria's illusions disappear, their gaiety and glamor disappear also and their home begins to reek of "the wretched aura of stale wine [and] the inevitable suggestion of beauty gone foul and revelry remembered in disgust" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 296).  </p>

<p><i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> repeatedly suggests that debunking illusions produces more disgust than insight, which largely explains why the birth of Beauty episode exists at all, that is, why Fitzgerald found it necessary to frame his otherwise earthly plot in terms of unearthly allegorical res. Allegory is ideally suited to effect a romantic "unity" of body, soul, and spirit in a work of realist fiction skeptical of the possibility of such unity because allegory is the form of <i>this-but-also-that</i>, in which the possible <i>this</i> stands in for the impossible, and often incommensurate, <i>that</i>. Frederic Jameson has described allegory as "precisely the dominant mode of expression of a world in which things have been for whatever reason utterly sundered from meaning, from spirit, from genuine human existence."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  If we press Jameson's formulation to include history, that is, to register not just an actual separation of things from meaning but also a longing for there to be—that is, for there to once <i>have been</i>—meaning, we see how a belief in the sundering of things from meanings actually reflects a need to create absent meanings in order to explain present things. Inventing the "romancings of generations" creates an "understanding" that Anthony can experience not as created but rather as remembered. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The novel not only employs allegories that testify to the fundamental separation of the concepts that they bind together but also itself becomes an allegory for its own impossibly self-contradictory aspiration to bind together romance and realism as Fitzgerald understood them at the time he wrote the novel. Just before the long passage depicting Gloria as a solar eternity, Anthony experiences a powerful desire "to paint her, to set her down <i>now, </i>as she was, as, with each relentless second, she could never be again" but then says to her, "I'm not a realist . . . . No, only the romanticist preserves the things worth preserving" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 73). Whereas the realist chronicles the passing of presence into absence (or simply denies the reality of presence in the first place), the romantic forestalls that passing by embedding presence in memory. But attempting to embed such romantic moments in a realist mode of chronicling induces an authorial multiple personality disorder, a split between Fitzgerald the realist and Fitzgerald the romanticist. By tracking the destruction of Anthony and Gloria's illusions, Fitzgerald sides with time. But by attempting to preserve the ground of their illusions, he attempts to transcend time and avoid change. In so doing, he undermines the clarity of his analysis of Anthony and Gloria's degeneration and thereby betrays a conservative terror of social change. </p>

Shoddy Realism: The Rise of Film and the Threat to "Serious" Literature 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Although few of the few scholars who write about <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> discuss it as a sociopolitical novel, the centrality of terror of social change to the novel's tonal incoherence demonstrates that one cannot make sense of the novel—or at least make sense of why it doesn't make sense—without careful attention to that change. In particular, I want to stress the importance to the novel of the acknowledged, fundamental historical features of that change—immigration, urbanization, and the concomitant erosion of established socioeconomic hierarchies. Indeed, one cannot make sense of either the novel or its incoherence without attending both to the novel's increasing tendency to link those features of change to movies and, ultimately, to the threat to literature that those features (and, by virtue of that linkage, that movies) come to represent in the novel.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> </p>

<p>Film's literal and symbolic connections to immigration, urbanization, and shifting hierarchies are frequent and fundamental. Film executive Joseph Bloeckman embodies them with particular clarity.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Bloeckman serves as Anthony's foil from start to finish; as Anthony falls, Bloeckman rises. And to take Anthony's place, Bloeckman has a lot of rising to do. Bloeckman's biography is a sort of composite history of a number of European immigrants, many of them Jews like Bloeckman, who got into movies while movies still bore the stigma of low-class amusement and who then became prosperous as the movies attracted larger and more affluent audiences.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  So, although Bloeckman is a "proud and dignified man" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 97) who has already succeeded in business, in the early parts of the novel he still has much to learn about elite, WASP New York society. He is an outsider to its history and traditions, a fact that he makes painfully clear when he attempts to sound rooted and cultured by declaring sententiously to the dinner 

<b></b>

 party, "When a man speaks he's merely tradition. He has at best a few thousand years back of him. But woman, why, she is the miraculous mouthpiece of posterity" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 99). Contemptuously amused, Anthony surmises that Bloeckman has memorized and delivered an intertitle from one of his movies. His contempt for the movies reinforces his contempt for Bloeckman. As Bloeckman continues to prosper, however, he gradually acquires the habits of the ruling class and adapts himself to its traditions. Indeed, by the end of the novel, we learn that Bloeckman's "process of general refinement [is] still in progress  . . .  in his manner there [is] perceptibly more assurance that the fine things of the world [are] his by a natural and inalienable right" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 305).  </p>

<p>Bloeckman's rise parallels and, indeed, represents the rise of the movie business. At the same time that Bloeckman's wealth is helping him move from gaucherie to sophistication, the source of his wealth is undergoing a similar gentrification as the heavily immigrant nickelodeons of early film give way to genteel movie palaces that attract middle- and upper-class patrons as well. So it is a measure of how dramatically Anthony's and Bloeckman's roles change in the course of the novel that after Gloria has failed a screen test (arranged by Bloeckman, a long-time admirer) she dresses up in the hopes that Anthony will take her "to a restaurant or even to one of the great, gorgeous moving picture palaces where there would be a few people to look at her, at whom she could bear to look in turn" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 411). But she has no money and Anthony is drunk again, and so she gets no glamorous evening out. Instead, a few pages later, a sloppily drunk and penniless Anthony finds Bloeckman at Bloeckman's private club, tries to borrow money, and then insults him, whereupon Bloeckman administers a clinical beating before having Anthony dumped in the street as a "bum" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 437). Bloeckman has by this point Anglicized himself even further by changing his name to Black, and the contemptuous beating that he gives Anthony demonstrates how powerful and genteel film money has made the "goddamn Jew" and how powerless and crude the loss of inherited money has made the once-aristocratic Anthony. </p>

<p>Bloeckman/Black's gentrification has very high stakes not only for Anthony but also for Fitzgerald. If Bloeckman's rise is the rise of film, then Anthony's fall bodes ill for what Fitzgerald considers serious fiction. While Anthony is only sporadically a writer of any kind and only notionally a writer of fiction, he belongs to the educated leisure class that establishes the values of what Fitzgerald treats in the novel as serious fiction. Indeed, in a scene toward the end, we see that film lies at the center of the novel's terror of social change precisely because its ascendancy seems to endanger the literary culture that Fitzgerald values. By the time the scene takes place, Anthony's longtime friend Dick Caramel has become a successful hack novelist and Anthony has stopped pretending to pursue any career but alcoholism. Their separate sadnesses underlie their debate about the changing function of art. Declaring all art elderly and moribund, Anthony predicts that poetry, already vitiated by the last-ditch efforts of the modernists, will die first. Anthony declares, "The beautiful word, the colored and glittering word, and the beautiful simile belong in prose now. To get attention, poetry has got to strain for the unusual word, the harsh, earthy word" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 421). The novel, Anthony contends, is the only literary form left with any hope to take beauty further. At this mention of 

<b></b>

 the novel, Dick takes the opportunity to vent some spleen. "I'm sick of all this shoddy realism," he declares, "I think there's a place for the romanticist in literature" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 421). Neither Anthony nor Fitzgerald, however, seem willing to grant Dick's romanticism the status of literature. Anthony is amused and vaguely horrified to learn than in Dick's new personal library—dedicated to what Dick calls "good American stuff, old and new"—one finds Dick's "execrably awful" novels sandwiched between Twain and Dreiser (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 422); it becomes clear that Dick's romanticism has deteriorated to the "Zane Grey-Rupert Hughes level."  </p>

<p>And, through Anthony, Fitzgerald blames film for that deterioration. As Anthony reflects on the pitiful fiction that Dick has produced since <i>The Demon Lover</i>, we learn that film has made writing such dubious fiction quite attractive. Even while Dick is writing <i>The Demon Lover</i>, he has become aware that "all the new novels are sold to the moving pictures as soon as they come out" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 96). And then in first the two years after the publication of <i>The Demon Lover, </i>Dick makes a great deal of money, Fitzgerald writes, because "the reward of the author of fiction had begun to swell unprecedentedly as a result of the voracious hunger of the motion pictures for plots" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 222). Dick receives a hefty $700 per story in the popular magazines and can count on another $1,000 from movie producers for "every one that contained enough 'action' (kissing, shooting, and sacrificing)" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 222).  </p>

<p>It's little wonder, then, to find much later in the book Anthony musing that Dick stands "accused of making a great fortune by writing trash for the movies." As the fashion in books shift[s]," Anthony thinks, Dick is "becoming almost a byword of contempt" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 422). Some of this contempt, clearly, applies not only to film but also to popular fiction (including Fitzgerald's own).<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  But even though mercenary fiction writers produce just as much "trash" as movie directors, it's important that in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> the directors have begun to dictate the norms of such trash: it must contain both a happy ending and the appropriate dosages of "action." Indeed, Dick's own diction betrays the extent to which the demands of writing "screenable plots" have infiltrated his thinking (see fn. 6). Echoing the inverted maxim that Fitzgerald makes the novel's epigraph, Anthony warns his successful friend not to let "the victor belong to the spoils." Revealingly, Dick responds, "You mean write trash? . . . . If you mean deliberately injecting a slushy fade-out into each one, I'm not. But  . . .  I'm certainly writing faster and I don't seem to be thinking as much as I used to" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 188). To the detriment of Dick's fiction, not just film vocabulary but also film conventions have begun to shape his thinking. </p>

<p>While Fitzgerald makes clear that he thinks that movies pose a real threat to literature, his reference to the changing "fashion in books" suggests that emerging novelists might be able to continue advancing the cause of Beauty, however much older writers like Dick may have faltered. Indeed, by specifying <i>This Side of Paradise</i> (and only <i>This Side of Paradise</i>) as an example of that new fashion (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 421), Fitzgerald implies that one ought to look to <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> as a test case of that new novel, to see if and how it advances the cause of Beauty despite the death of old arts and the emergence of new ones. In the most obvious senses, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> 

<b></b>

 succeeds where Dick's novels fail. After all, it stands as a contrast to the ethical and formal norms of contemporary Hollywood cinema, particularly to those that Fitzgerald identifies. It is "full of talk and psychology" and therefore "impossible to make  . . .  interesting on the screen" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 96). And it has no Hollywood ending; good reaps no rewards and evil suffers no comeuppance—worse, we have a hard time identifying any good at all. Further, one of the most important scenes in the novel—its "Symposium" scene—consists of a verbose discussion of philosophy meant to take on an eerie feeling by occurring in the dark, all of which would have presented quite a challenge to a silent filmmaker. Indeed, though no print of William Seiter's 1922 adaptation has survived, extant plot summaries seem to indicate that Seiter ignored those challenges in favor of making a conventional movie about ambition, repentance, and its protagonists' ultimate happiness. So, by neither going heavy on the action nor injecting a slushy fade-out, Fitzgerald avoids the obvious snares that capture Dick, his nightmarish alter ego.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>   </p>

<p>But obvious snares aren't the only snares, and film continues to make its presence felt in the novel. What <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> lacks in shooting and sacrificing, it makes up for in kissing, and that kissing implicitly allies it with precisely the sort of films that have diminished Dick's fiction. During a dinner party at the Biltmore hosted by Gloria, Anthony and Gloria sneak away for a carriage ride, during which they kiss for the first time. As Anthony leans in to kiss Gloria, "she turn[s] her face up to him, pale under the wisps and patches of light that trailed in like moonshine through a foliage" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102). And then, as they share a kiss "never to be described, scarcely to be remembered," her beauty gives off "emanations of itself which settled transiently and already dissolving upon his heart.  . . .  The buildings [fall] away in melted shadows; this [is] the Park now  . . . " (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102). When they return to the restaurant, Bloeckman and Dick are discussing "the influence of literature on moving pictures" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 103). So, well before Dick starts injecting slushy fade-outs, Anthony and Gloria's kiss shows that influence between film and fiction has already begun to move in both directions. In particular, the old conventions of romantic melodrama (gaslight drama) that film adopted from literature and stage have first undergone modernization and have then pushed their way back into literature; the arc light has replaced moonlight as the source of romantic glow, and behind this techno-romantic moment one can hear the faint whir of the projector. </p>

<p>Indeed, in a complicated associative knot that shows film's centrality to both the novel's realist <i>and</i> romantic strains, almost all Anthony's kissing has progressively more to do with film. Consider, for example, Anthony's predilection for working-class girls. Before Anthony meets Gloria, he has a minor fling with Geraldine Burke, an usher at a Keith vaudeville theater. A self-proclaimed "good girl," Geraldine is mentally limited and morally conventional. She will kiss but go no further. But just as vaudeville gave way to movies in theaters across America, film later helps an adulterous affair replace this quaint kissing liaison.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  After the draft has made Anthony a private in the army, he leaves the base whenever possible to wander the streets of the small Georgia town nearby. There he meets Dot, the lonely young woman with whom he begins an affair. Anthony begins his seduction by coaxing her to see a film with him at the Bijou Moving 

<b></b>

 Picture Theatre, and most of their subsequent dates also begin at that theater. The Hollywoodish action of kissing thus generates not only the novel's main romantic plot line (Anthony's love for Gloria) but also its realist critique of that plot line (of which Anthony's affair with Dot constitutes a significant part). </p>

<p>As Anthony and Gloria's place in the social hierarchy grows increasingly fraught, we see with increasing frequency and clarity the novel's tonal incoherence about their plight as well as film's increasingly central and complex contribution to that incoherence. One can perhaps best see this in Gloria's pivotal screen test for Bloeckman. From the beginning, Bloeckman has urged Gloria to come to his studio for a test. But Anthony opposes her doing so, so she doesn't accept the offer until Anthony returns from the army (and from his affair) and quickly becomes unendurable. Bloeckman arranges for her to audition for a Cecil B. DeMille parody named Percy B. Debris. During the audition, Gloria plays the wife of a businessman who learns by telephone that her husband has died in an automobile accident, whereupon she collapses with sorrow. Gloria passably acquits herself, but Debris decides that she, now in her late twenties, is too old to play the ingénue and offers her a smaller, less glamorous role of a widow. Panicked, Gloria turns down the role and looks in the mirror. Visible signs of age stun her: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Oh, my pretty face," she whispered, passionately grieving. "Oh, my pretty face! Oh, I don't want to live without my pretty face! Oh, what's <i>happened</i>?"</p>
<p>Then she slid toward the mirror and, as in the test, sprawled face downward upon the floor—and lay there sobbing. It was the first awkward movement she had ever made.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(B&amp;D, 404)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In the birth of Beauty interlude, the Voice has already told Beauty, "Your life on earth will be, as always, the interval between two significant glances in a mundane mirror" (B&amp;D, 29). Here, then, we have that second glance and thus the death of Beauty.  </p>

<p>Film plays a far more ambivalent and complicated role in the death of Beauty than one would expect from a novel that has set itself up as a challenge to the simpleminded stylings of Percy B. Debris, and that complexity shows that film's influence has begun to spread beyond just the novel's plot. The death of Gloria's movie husband could parallel the death of her love for Anthony, and the mirror at the end might well reflect her emotional grief as much as her physical aging. Even if one doesn't accept that interpretation, it becomes clear that film has begun to change the characters' actions and psychologies. Moreover, it becomes clear that film has moved from being a thematic opposite of literature to being part of the novel's representational strategies. Gloria's fall marks not only the end of one illusion but also the re-establishment of a new kind of illusion. She falls, after all, "as in the test." Thus, what Fitzgerald dismisses before (and, to a lesser extent, after) her fall as sentimental twaddle has nonetheless become both the instrument and the mode of meaningful revelation.  </p>

<p>Film has come to play a paradoxical role: it is the illusion that takes over when illusion fails. We see this again, even more powerfully, a few pages later when Anthony yet again visits a grungy speakeasy. Denied "the fruit of youth," Anthony now relies on 

<b></b>

 the fruit "of the grape" in order to preserve "the old illusion that truth and beauty were in some way intertwined" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 417). And he takes particular solace in the ignorance of his drinking companions at the speakeasy:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>He liked them because they knew nothing about him, because they lived in the obvious and had not the faintest conception of the inevitable continuity of life. They sat not before a motion picture show with consecutive reels, but at a musty old-fashioned travelogue with all the values stark and hence all implications confused.</p>

<p class="continued">Here, only a few pages after Gloria's awkward moment, movies become even more explicitly real life <i>and</i> illusion. Real life is like a feature film, moving irrevocably from one reel to the next in crisp images, but drunken, substitute life is like a murky one-reeler with neither clarity nor development.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  So the passage complicates Fitzgerald's earlier thematizing of film as a medium devoid of thought; film, per se, is no longer an undifferentiated blot on the culture; instead, it has its own traits and history, some progressive, some retrogressive.  </p>

<p>Moreover, by granting film a history Fitzgerald reverses the nostalgic logic of his romantic allegories. Here, film becomes not less interesting as time passes but rather more so because (in Fitzgerald's version) as classical Hollywood cinema replaces the cinema of attractions, values become clearer. In this passage, modern films actually stand for clear and even non-obvious thought. Moreover, as we have seen, modern films also represent the inevitable passage of time and thus the passage into the ever more modern, a dangerous movement in a novel passionately terrified of the passage of each "relentless second." More than the particular valence of film in a particular passage, however, we should note that by this point film has come to influence the novel so thoroughly that it can occupy numerous and sometimes contradictory roles in its signification and symbolism. Indeed, movies have become both a deeply complicated embodiment of and an answer to the novel's terror about time and social change.  </p>

"Never to Be Described": Film as Formal Influence 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Having tracked film's central role in the novel's incoherence, we are in a position to see precisely how film shaped the novel's technique. Let us begin by returning to Anthony and Gloria's first kiss. The kiss is supposedly "never to be described, scarcely to be remembered" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102), but not only does Fitzgerald describe how "she turn[s] her face up to [Anthony], pale under the wisps and patches of light that trailed in like moonshine through a foliage" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102), he also returns to that kiss during one of Anthony's adulterous interludes with Dot: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Anthony had a start of memory, so vivid that before his closed eyes there formed a picture, distinct as a flashback on a screen—a spring night of thaw set out of time in a half-forgotten winter five years before—another face, radiant, flower-like, upturned to lights as transforming as the stars. </p>
	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>B&amp;D</i>, 329) 

<b></b>
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->


</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Both Anthony's memory and Fitzgerald's handling of it have become not only profoundly visual but also profoundly filmic (and the flashback, of course, reinforces the connection between Gloria and Beauty developed since the "Flash-Back in Paradise"). Memory, even memory that preserves the romantic glory of Beauty, becomes timeless by working <i>like film</i>, by functioning like a screen kiss whose participants, like mechanical flowers, turn their faces to ersatz stars.  </p>

<p>That kiss gives us further evidence of how film takes over crucial parts of the novel. Let us remember how Fitzgerald describes Gloria's beauty: giving off "emanations of itself which settled transiently and already dissolving upon his heart.  . . .  The buildings fell away in melted shadows; this was the Park now" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102). The ellipses are Fitzgerald's, and both the descriptive logic and diction of the passage ("dissolving," "melted") make them function like a dissolve. So, though Fitzgerald describes the kiss as beyond the reach of description and almost beyond memory, he describes it filmically and then does the same with Anthony's memory of those moments. Thus, the kiss that sets the novel into motion not only is the sort of filmic "action" that Fitzgerald claims to resist but also is handled in a film-like dissolve and then revisited via flashback. </p>

<p>Not only does the novel's main plot begin with a filmic moment handled in filmic terms, the scene that ends the plot functions much the same way. On the day that Anthony and Gloria will learn whether they have won their final appeal regarding Anthony's contested inheritance, Anthony decides not to go to court. While he lounges uselessly around his apartment, Dot suddenly reappears. Despite Anthony's having abandoned her, she has come to New York to declare her love and to insist upon their making a life together. Her presence throws Anthony into an insane rage, and he demands that she leave. She initially refuses, and by the time she starts toward the door his fury has taken over: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Uttering a harsh, broken shout, he seized [the stiff oaken chair], swung it above his head and let it go with all his raging strength straight at the white, frightened face across the room  . . .  then a thick, impenetrable darkness came down upon him and blotted out thought, rage, and madness together—with almost a tangible snapping sound the face of the world changed before his eyes . . . .</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>B&amp;D</i>, 446, ellipses in original)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Fitzgerald follows this with a section break. Here we have not a dissolve but rather a close-up (or an iris-in) on Dot's face followed by a fade to black. After the section break, Gloria and Dick return to the apartment to tell Anthony that the judge has broken the will and that they will at last inherit all of his grandfather's money. They find that he has temporarily reverted to a childhood obsession with stamps and that he seems uninterested in his windfall. This bizarre behavior suggests that something awful has happened, that he has quite possibly killed Dot. But Gloria and Dick find no evidence of her death when they return, and in the few remaining pages, Fitzgerald says nothing one way or the other. The fade-out has swallowed all certainty.  </p>

<p>Fitzgerald's handling of Anthony's attack on Dot has a complicated relationship to Hollywood film. On one hand, it stands as a triumphant counterexample to Dick's slushy fade-outs; there is no happy ending for Dot, no kiss, no sacrifice. On the other hand, 

<b></b>

 though not quite an actual shooting, attempting to obliterate someone with a chair qualifies as "action," and in a way this fade-out does allow Anthony to inherit his money without scandal or complication and to sail in state to Europe—which might count as a happy ending for any reader not thoroughly nauseated by Anthony and Gloria's self-indulgence and self-pity. And, although in 1922 a conventional Hollywood movie probably wouldn't have left the status of such an important action unclear, it's equally true that, even before the industry adopted the Hays Code, few if any directors would have pointed their cameras straight at the brutal death of a woman, so in a way the fade-out is the clearest evidence that Dot <i>does</i> die. If she were to survive, Fitzgerald wouldn't need to pull down the darkness. </p>

<p>The darkness pulled down on Dot not only eliminates any lingering hope that the radiant, growing light of "all beauty and illusion" will triumph but also, through involuntary formal mimicry, indicates the extent to which film has changed not just the face of Anthony's world but also the novel's style, visual imagination, and narrative technique. Although film's contributions to the Fitzgerald technique is in many ways the most interesting and innovative feature of the novel—and although Fitzgerald in later novels would join other writers in exploring film's formal resources—in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, Fitzgerald's phobic reaction to film in this crucial example of arc-light fiction ends in confusion, "all values stark," and then, simply, dark. </p>

 rather than its existence. For example, Christopher Ames and Tim Prchal have both separately written reassessments of Fitzgerald's Pat Hobby stories in which they try to rescue those particular stories from relegation to the hack bin. In doing so, however, neither critic can divest himself of the need to draw categorical lines between good fiction and commercial fiction and, especially, between good fiction and Hollywood storytelling. Ames describes Hobby as a victim of the hackneyed, Hollywood plots that he tries both to sell and to put in motion in his own life.

Scott Fitzgerald in the Twenty-First Century</i>, eds. Jackson R. Bryer, Ruth Prigozy, and Milton R. Stern (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2003), 289. Prchal also sees the stories as satires of the "Hollywood fantasy factory" that "permeates and romanticizes [Hobby's] self-image"; he argues that Fitzgerald is delicately playing the conventions of the "popular series" against themselves in order to give his work "literary depth." Tim Prchal, "Tune in Next Month: Fitzgerald's Pat Hobby and the Popular Series," in <i>Fitzgerald in the Twenty-First Century</i>, 293 and 292. Even Robert Martin, who seeks to invert the notion of Fitzgerald as a serious writer forced to support himself as a commercial writer, has no problem with the idea that one can and should separate the two kinds of writing both generally and specifically in Fitzgerald's case. So while Martin argues that Fitzgerald was "a commercial writer" who "chose to think of himself as primarily a novelist," he doesn't devote attention to the possibility of connections between Fitzgerald's divergent halves.

Film is theatrical but also not; film seems morally and socially suspect but also not.

The word seems not to have entered into usage, at least common usage, in America until 1903 or 1904, when famous travel lecturer Burton Holmes began using it to describe his lectures, which since 1897 had included films as part of the program (by 1899 the films were directly related to the lectures)—see Burton Holmes, <i>Burton Holmes Travelogue</i> Volume 1 (New York: McClure, 1910), in unpaginated "Biographical Note." Given the textual context and the fact that, since before Fitzgerald would remember, travelogues could and often did include film segments, it seems likely that Fitzgerald is referring to filmed travelogues in the passage quoted.</p>

Lewis and Nietzsche: Antithetical Views 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The first phase of Nietzsche's influence on European philosophy, politics, and literature began in earnest only in the last decade of the nineteenth century, gathering considerable momentum in the early decades of the twentieth century, and reaching a height, in Germany, in the early 1930s, when his thought was effectively appropriated by the ideologues of the Nazi Party, principally through the stewardship of Alfred Baeumler, professor of philosophy in Berlin from 1933 to 1945 and author of <i>Nietzsche der Philosoph und Politiker</i> (<i>Nietzsche the Philosopher and Politician</i> [1931]).<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Reacting against Baeumler's reading of Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger delivered a major series of lectures on the philosopher between 1936 and 1940 at the University of Freiburg, culminating in a critical analysis of Nietzsche's conception of "European nihilism." Within the ambit of English literature, however, perhaps no writer of the first half of the twentieth century has more often been seen as under the influence of both Nietzsche's thought and his style than Wyndham Lewis (1882–1957). Indeed, for almost all commentators on Lewis's oeuvre, Nietzsche remains an absolutely decisive re, although the precise nature of Nietzsche's influence on Lewis has tended to be conceived in two, more or less diametrically opposed, ways. </p>

<p>On the one hand, there is the position exemplified by John Carey in his 1992 book <i>The Intellectuals and the Masses</i>. Here, in a chapter provocatively entitled "Wyndham Lewis and Hitler," Carey identifies Lewis as essentially Nietzschean in order 

<b></b>

 simply to dismiss him out of hand. In an act of radical literary decanonization, Carey claims that in his early career Lewis "greatly admired" Nietzsche, an admiration unreservedly reflected in Lewis's 1917 essay "The Code of a Herdsman," at the heart of which is a distinction between "the herd" and "the mountain people," the latter being called upon to "mock the herd perpetually with the grimace of its own garrulity or deadness" and to "eschew all clichés implying a herd personality."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  In the briefest of analyses, Carey argues that in "The Code of a Herdsman" Lewis simply "adopts the familiar Nietzschean symbolic landscape."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  There is much in Lewis's oeuvre to support Carey's claim that Lewis remains an essentially Nietzschean thinker: in addition to his privileging of an intellectual élite over the many, there is his early rejection of democracy, his celebration of what in the first issue of <i>Blast</i> (June 1914) he terms the "proud, handsome and predatory," his Vorticist conception of the "northern"—"We assert that the art for these climates, then, must be a northern flower"; "Tragic humour is the birthright of the North"—his unremitting polemicism, and, perhaps above all, his foundational distinction between the artist or, more precisely, the artist-intellectual and the "average" or "common" man.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> </p>

<p>What Carey leaves out of account, however, no doubt because it does not fit quite so neatly into his own polemical discourse on the modern, is the host of complications that render any simple connection between the "Nietzschean symbolic landscape," Lewis, and Nazism decidedly problematical. For instance, even in "The Code of a Herdsman" Lewis is already barring the "mountain people" from the realm of the political: "Do not play with political notions, aristocratisms or the reverse, for that is a compromise with the herd" (<i>EWL</i>, 27). We shall have reason to return to this banning of the artist-intellectual from the political, and indeed the possibility of an art that would be free of any political position. Secondly, and no less significantly, point 16 of "The Code" reads: "Contradict yourself. In order to live, you must remain broken up" (<i>EWL</i>, 29). It is contradiction, polemical energy turned back on the self and on the coherence of that self's work, that is one of the structuring-destructuring principles of Lewis's entire oeuvre<i>.</i> Indeed, the very repetitiveness of that oeuvre, upon which Carey remarks so dismissively, is arguably the repetitiveness of an iteration that, paradoxically, both reinforces and weakens its argument. </p>

<p>Furthermore, in order to reduce the early Lewis to no more than an acolyte of Nietzsche, Carey has to give the shortest of shrifts to the almost unremitting critique of Nietzsche that is to be found in Lewis's major works of the 1920s and 1930s. Of this critique, to which I shall turn shortly, Carey declares that it is to be explained as a typically Nietzschean élitist reaction on Lewis's part to the increasing popularity of Nietzsche in intellectual and artistic circles in the 1920s, and that, despite the "reservations" expressed by Lewis regarding Nietzsche in <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i>  and elsewhere, Nietzsche "continued to be a potent influence on Lewis."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  One of the ironies of Carey's summary analysis of Lewis's relation to Nietzsche, an irony of which Carey himself shows not the least awareness, is that it repeats Lewis's own polemicism, leaving us not with an answer to Lewis's relation to Nietzsche but rather with the task of tracing, with considerably more attention to the textual details of the case, the history 

<b></b>

 of Lewis's response to Nietzsche, particularly during the two crucial decades leading up to the outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in 1939 and Lewis's own attempt to think Nietzsche's relation to fascism in <i>The Hitler Cult</i> . </p>

<p>Before beginning that analysis, however, it is first necessary to consider the other way in which Lewis's relation to Nietzsche has been read in recent years. For, radically opposed to Carey's strategy of tarring Lewis with Nietzscheanism (as a kind of proto-fascism or proto-Nazism), there is the position taken by more theoretically informed commentators such as Toby Foshay, Paul Edwards, and Andrzej Gąsiorek. Whereas Carey identifies Lewis as Nietzschean in order to dismiss him, both Foshay and Gąsiorek identify Lewis as Nietzschean in order to save him, not least from his association with fascism. Crucially, however, they would save him not as a modernist but rather as a postmodernist. This reading depends not only upon a reinterpretation of Lewis, but also upon a reinterpretation of Nietzsche, a reinterpretation that ironically finds its specific point of origin in Fredric Jameson's 1979 monograph on Lewis, <i>Fables of Aggression: Wyndham Lewis: The Modernist as Fascist</i>. The Lewis that Jameson presents to us is characterized by a "consistent perversity"; Lewis becomes an antinomic re at the very heart of the modernist movement, "at one and the same time the exemplary practitioner of one of the most powerful of all modernistic styles and an aggressive ideological critic and adversary of modernism itself in all its forms."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Commentators following Jameson's lead on Lewis, while trying to free him (as Lewis would try to free himself) from the "modernist as fascist" label, have sought to identify in this "consistent perversity" not a self-contradictory, self-defeating, or incoherent modernism, but rather a fully-fledged postmodernism at the heart of modernism. The central thesis of Foshay's 1992 monograph on Lewis, for instance, is that he "represents a strain of post-aestheticist writing that differs significantly from what has come to be defined as 'modernist'."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Paul Edwards, in his magisterial <i>Wyndham Lewis: Painter and Writer</i> , claims that Lewis's work offers "the most comprehensive critique we have of the modernist urge to overcome our dereliction by violently breaking through to a realm of authenticity, a reality transcending our divided condition."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Lewis's critique of the dream of transcendence would extend not only to his familiar <i>bête noire</i>, Henri Bergson, but also to Nietzsche and in particular his theory of the "Overman" ("Übermensch"). If, as early as 1912, Lewis is "freeing himself from the confines of Bergson and Nietzsche," he is, according to Edwards, never simply Nietzschean in his outlook: "he always mistrusted the slightly hysterical optimism of Bergson and Nietzsche, with their unrealistic visions of transcendence."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For commentators such as Foshay and Edwards, then, the postmodernity of Lewis's critique of modernism from within lies in its resistance to grand narratives, to the dream of transcendence, to the very idea of authenticity, and to the modernist surface-and-depth model, in favor of what Lewis himself terms an "<i>externalist</i> art"—which is to say, the art of a pure surface that hides no depth at all: in other words, a postmodern art of the simulacrum.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Such an externalist art would be ideally suited to Lewis's conception of the human as a re without depth or (borrowing from Artaud) a body without organs. This break with the metaphor of depth or interiority is marked as early as <i>The Caliph's </i>

<b></b>

 <i>Design</i> , at least with regard to the "common man": "The life of the crowd, of the common or garden man, is exterior. He can only live through others, outside himself. He, in a sense, <i>is</i> the houses, the railings, the bunting or absence of bunting. His beauty and justification is in a superficial exterior life. His health is there."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  </p>

<p>In his recent monograph on Lewis, Andrzej Gąsiorek follows very much in Foshay's and Edwards's footsteps, arguing that Lewis's oeuvre is essentially self-deconstructive. Again, at the heart of this rereading—or, more precisely, this revaluation—of Lewis there lies the re of Nietzsche. Agreeing with Carey's claim that Nietzsche was "a huge early influence" on Lewis, Gąsiorek nonetheless proceeds to argue that Lewis carefully distinguishes two strands in Nietzsche's thought. On the one hand, there is the Nietzsche who calls for a revaluation of all values (<i>Umwertung alle Werte</i>): with this Nietzsche, Lewis would be in full agreement. On the other hand, there is the Nietzsche who privileges the Dionysian over the Apollonian: with this second Nietzsche, the deconstructive Lewis will have no truck: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In common with other writers and artists, Lewis followed Nietzsche in urging the complete revaluation of European modernity and arguing for a transformative creativity capable of reimagining and reinventing the present. But he systematically rejected all arts of and philosophies of a dionysian hue, on the grounds that their search for cultural renewal entailed the collapsing of subject/object distinctions and depended on the mistaken belief that regeneration may be brought about when the intellectual is abandoned and the subject achieves union with a mystically conceived <i>élan vital</i>.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">If Gąsiorek appears rather unhelpfully to conflate Nietzsche with Bergson here, this is justified, at least in part, by Lewis himself doing something very similar on numerous occasions, and perhaps most insistently in <i>Time and Western Man</i> . Having emphasized Lewis's critical distance from the "Dionysian" Nietzsche, Gąsiorek proceeds to argue for a Lewis who is quite simply antithetical to Carey's Nietzschean-fascist stooge. Gąsiorek's Lewis is a writer and an artist whose best work is governed by a principle of heteronomy, an openness to alterity not despite, but through, its very polemicism: "in the main," Gąsiorek concludes, Lewis "resisted the abject fantasy that one can <i>become</i> other in favour of a deconstructive strategy that sought to <i>reinscribe</i> otherness within the discourses that excluded it, thus mocking spurious conceptions of cultural homogeneity and making 'the West' other to itself."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  </p>

<p>So it is, then, that we now have two antithetical Lewises to contend with, both thoroughly indebted to Nietzsche, although the postmodern or deconstructive Lewis is indebted either to a Nietzsche who is already self-deconstructing or to a Nietzsche who has been split in two. For all their obvious differences, however, both of the above takes on Lewis—that is to say, the attack on and the defense of Lewis—tend to obscure the many complications and paradoxes of Lewis's response to Nietzsche's thought. These complications and these paradoxes are at their greatest when it comes to the question of nihilism—that "uncanniest of all guests" ("unheimlichste aller Gäste"), according to Nietzsche.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Indeed, it is the fate of this concept in Lewis's own work that marks an indebtedness to Nietzsche that is arguably more significant than any other. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Although the terms "nihilism," "nihilist," and "nihilistic" do not originate with Nietzsche, they certainly enter the main stream of modern European thought through him, and in particular through his <i>On the Genealogy of Morals</i> , which Lewis certainly read, and Book One ("European Nihilism") of the fragments published posthumously under the title <i>The Will to Power</i> . As for Lewis's own deployment of the term "nihilism," in his early critique of Nietzsche in <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i>  he refers not to nihilism as such but rather to "Schopenhauerian pessimism." In <i>Time and Western Man</i>, the terms "nihilistic" and "nihilism" each occur only once. "Nihilistic despair" is used in a section focusing on Nietzsche's <i>Genealogy of Morals</i>, from which Lewis takes the term.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  And, in his conclusion, Lewis again draws on the <i>Genealogy</i> when he claims that science is "nihilism" in that it produces an object-world that "'exists' in the same sense and on the same level of reality as the image"; in other words, science produces a world that is strictly speaking "unreal" (<i>TWM</i>, 443). Lewis's study of Shakespeare, <i>The Lion and the Fox</i> , contains a brief chapter on "Shakespeare's Nihilism," and this chapter is important not least because it is the <i>only</i> occasion on which Lewis anticipates the postmodern gesture of Baudrillard or Gianni Vattimo by deploying nihilism as a value. Taking issue with A. C. Bradley's claim that the ending of <i>King Lear</i> contains an irony that leads not to despair but to "christian optimism," Lewis argues that the "punctual arrival of Cordelia, brought in like a Christmas present, so <i>narquois</i> and so pat, cannot be anything but what it forces us at once to see it as: an expression of the poet's mockery at the vanity of human supplications, and notions of benevolent powers, of whom we are the cherished children."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  According to Lewis, then, Shakespeare's nihilism would liberate us from a childish fantasy of, and dependence upon, the divine. If Lewis's use of the term "nihilism" is significant here precisely because nihilism is on this unique occasion presented as a liberating negation, it is only in the long essay "The Diabolical Principle," first published in the third and, as it proved, final issue of Lewis's review <i>The Enemy</i> (1927–29), that he addresses the question of nihilism explicitly and in detail. Here, however, he borrows the term from his own enemy, Elliot Paul, to whose essay "The New Nihilism" he is responding. It is this "new Nihilism" that Lewis proceeds to critique in "The Diabolical Principle." Before analyzing this critique, however, it is first necessary to trace Lewis's more general response to Nietzsche, which frames his take on nihilism. </p>

Lewis versus Nietzsche: Limited Difference 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Those commentators who insist that Lewis distinguishes clearly between two strands in Nietzsche's thought are relying on numerous declarations of just such a distinction in Lewis's own works. One of the last of these occurs in Lewis's late autobiography, <i>Rude Assignment</i> , in which he states: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Nietzsche was, I believe, the paramount influence, as was the case with so many people prior to world war i.  . . .  But for me Nietzsche was, with Schopenhauer, a thinker more immediately accessible to a Western mind than the other Germans, whose barbarous 

<b></b>

 jargon was a great barrier—Hegel, for instance, I could never read. A majority of people, I daresay, found in the author of "Zarathustra" a sort of titanic nourishment for the ego: treating in fact this great hysteric as a power-house. At present that is what I like least about Nietzsche: and I was reasonably immune then to Superman. The impulse to titanism and supernatural afflatus pervading German romanticism has never had any interest for me. On the other hand that side of his genius which expressed itself in "La Gaya Scienza," or those admirable maxims, rather resembling Butler's "Notebooks," which he wrote after the breakdown in his health, were among my favourite reading in those years.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">What is not spelled out here is that by 1939 Lewis had come to see Nietzsche "the great hysteric" as the intellectual father of fascism, radically opposed to that other Nietzsche, the "good European," the father of an internationalism with which Lewis would associate himself after his disillusionment with nationalism. As we shall see, the distinction that Lewis makes both in <i>Rude Assignment</i> and elsewhere between two strands in Nietzsche becomes a way of making sense of his own intellectual history. That the concept of nihilism will survive all these discriminations, however, is a fact that has tended to remain unremarked upon in commentaries on Lewis, be they attacks upon, or defenses of, his oeuvre. And it is in the fate of the concept of nihilism in his work, not in the distinction he makes between two strands in Nietzsche's thought, that both Lewis's debt to Nietzsche and the limits of his reading of Nietzsche lie. </p>

<p>As Paul Edwards observes, Lewis first read Nietzsche (not in the original German, but in French translation) at roughly the same time as he was reading Bergson, and was soon deploying him in his critique of Italian Futurism. In the first issue of his Vorticist review, <i>Blast</i>, for instance, Nietzsche is neither blessed nor blasted, but appears by name in an attack on Filippo Marinetti: "His war-talk, sententious elevation and much besides, Marinetti picked up from Nietzsche."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Nietzsche returns, ever so slightly masked, in <i>The Caliph's Design</i>  as that "German philosopher" who subscribes to the notion of an "aesthetic justification of the universe," an idea treated, if not with mockery, at least with skepticism, by Lewis: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>A German philosopher, living in the heyday of last century German music, accepted the theory of an aesthetic justification of the universe. Many people play with this notion, just as they play with Art. But we should have to disembarrass "art" of a good deal of cheap adhesive matter, and cheap and pretty adhesive people, before it could appear a justification for anything at all; much less for such a gigantic and, from every point of view, dubious concern as the Universe!<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The allusion here is to the following, celebrated statement in Nietzsche's first book, <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i> : "It is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The first extended analysis of Nietzsche's thought by Lewis occurs in Part IV ("Vulgarization and Political Decay") of <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i> . Surprisingly—at least for those who consider Lewis an out-and-out Nietzschean, or who would contrast his attitude to Nietzsche with his attitude to Bergson and the other "time-philosophers"—Lewis's reaction to Nietzsche here is scarcely less negative than his reaction 

<b></b>

 to Bergson in <i>Time and Western Man</i> . Just like every other re in the modern pantheon (including all the major literary modernists, from Pound to Eliot to Joyce to Woolf), Nietzsche is the target of polemical attack by Lewis. In <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i>, Nietzsche is identified as "the archetype of the vulgarizer."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The object of his vulgarization is "the notion of aristocracy and power," which, Lewis argues, is "surely the most absurd, illogical, and meaningless thing that he could have chosen for that purpose" (<i>ABR</i>, 113). By "vulgarization" here, Lewis means at once popularization and devaluation: Nietzsche leads the populace to believe in its own aristocratic nature, thereby negating the very principle of the <i>aristos</i>. In this act of vulgarization, Nietzsche might be said to be the first properly modern philosopher. In <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i>, Nietzsche forms an unholy trinity with the two other great "vulgarizers" of the modern age: Bergson and Freud. Through an argument that is itself clearly a repetition of Nietzsche's own strategy, Lewis turns Nietzsche back against himself, making of the self-declared anti-Christian Nietzsche a philosopher of Christian humility: "Nietzsche was in fact himself, where philosophy was concerned, a sort of Christ" (<i>ABR</i>, 114). What Lewis means by this is that Nietzsche preaches, self-contradictorily, an aristocratism that is open to all, the empirical proof of this being the sudden waxing of Nietzsche's posthumous star: "A few years after his dramatic exit from the stage he became the greatest popular success of any philosopher of modern times" (<i>ABR</i>, 114); in this, Nietzsche anticipates the popularity of both Bergson and Freud in the early decades of the twentieth century. </p>

<p>However, if Lewis's attack on the popular (because vulgarizing) Nietzsche is in fact scarcely less virulent than his attacks on Bergson, this is not because Lewis is simply opposed to Nietzsche rather than (as Carey argues) neatly aligned with him. The targets of Lewis's polemics are precisely those res with whom he shares something essential, and Lewis certainly finds "truths" in Nietzsche, not least the "truth" of that depthless surface which underlies Lewis's own externalist aesthetic. Later in <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i>, for instance, Lewis declares: "that we are surface creatures, is the truth that Nietzsche insisted on so wisely" (<i>ABR</i>, 231). More generally, however, one might argue that Lewis's <i>polemos</i>, a <i>polemos</i> that includes Nietzsche while being governed by him, takes the form of what Derrida in his later work terms "autoimmunization," which is to say, a procedure whereby the self (<i>autos</i>) turns back on itself suicidally, ruining its own integrity.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Nietzsche, then, as Lewis's polemical other, is none other than Lewis himself, or at least a certain Lewis. And, crucially, for Lewis to constitute himself as a theorist of "Vulgarization and Political Decay"—in other words, as a theorist of what he will later term "nihilism"—he has to engage in this radical act of self-separation or self-aggression, by way of a certain Nietzsche, a Nietzsche himself split by Lewis into, on the one hand, the great vulgarizer and, on the other hand, the truth-bearer, the philosopher who articulates the truth of the depthless surface, which calls for the very externalist art that Lewis himself will aim both to theorize and to practice, most elaborately in <i>The Apes of God</i> . Lewis's <i>polemos</i> with Nietzsche, then, is not simply the expression of a rampant individualism (as Carey claims), but rather a practice of autoimmunizing self-assertion that would deconstitute the very thing it serves to constitute. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Returning to Lewis's critique of Nietzsche in <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i>, we find that the heart of that critique concerns the will to power (<i>Wille zur Macht</i>), which Lewis, anticipating Heidegger, identifies as "the central feature of his thought" (<i>ABR</i>, 117). Nietzsche's theory of the will to power is, he argues, inextricably rooted in the "<i>Will-school</i>" of philosopher, and thus can be traced back to Schopenhauer. In his attempt to overcome Schopenhauer's "pessimism of thought and knowledge," Nietzsche proposes a countering "affirmation" that is essentially the expression of a "<i>will to action</i>" directed against the intellect, which is to say against Lewis's own principal value. The will to power itself is simply surplus energy, above and beyond the energy required for the Darwinian "struggle for existence." In Nietzsche, this surplus (or "creative") energy is not invested in art, which is where, according to Lewis (and indeed a certain Nietzsche), it should be invested; rather, this surplus energy is reinvested in the very struggle that it exceeds. This, according to Lewis, is Nietzsche's great failing, the failing that Lewis's own work would correct: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Any criticism of Nietzsche must rest on that point: that of his suggested employment and utilization of this superfluous energy <i>to go on doing the same things that we should be doing without it</i>.  . . .  He was so impregnated with the pessimism of Schopenhauer, and his health was so broken by his experiences in the Franco-Prussian War, that he could not imagine, really, the mind doing anything else with itself than what it did in post-darwinian or schopenhauerian pessimism: to just go on contemplating the horrors of existence. And in reality the will to enjoy was dead in Nietzsche, much as he clamoured for latin light-heartedness. He had plenty of Will left: only, it was Will to struggle merely, not Will to live.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In other words, Nietzsche remains fixated by, and imprisoned within, the very nihilism that he was the first both to diagnose and to attempt to overcome. Lewis's Nietzsche is the first of the great reinvestors in European nihilism, the first of the great reinvestors in that greatest of devaluations, that absolute devaluation of the "highest values" which reduces existence to "horror." The ambivalence of Lewis's own relation to Nietzsche is to be understood, then, not simply in terms of an élitism that could not abide sharing its preferences, but more fundamentally in terms of a nihilism that Nietzsche diagnoses but from which he is unable to free himself. That Nietzsche himself was not unaware of this is suggested, of course, by his description of nihilism as the "uncanniest of all guests." Given such an analysis of Nietzsche, it is scarcely surprising that in his later works Lewis should repeatedly associate Nietzsche with the "time-philosophers" (above all, Bergson) and the art of music (an inward, temporal art, the very antithesis of that "externalist" art advocated by Lewis). In an irony that (as we shall see) returned to haunt Lewis himself, Nietzsche, the great diagnostician of European nihilism, is aligned with the very nihilism against which his great "affirmation" was supposed to militate. </p>

<p>At times, however, the autoimmunizing Nietzsche of <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i> is presented by Lewis as a rather less complicated re. Already in <i>Time and Western Man</i> , Nietzsche is being presented, like Bergson, as no more than a child of Darwin, having applied the Darwinian theory of natural selection to the political and 

<b></b>

 cultural spheres. In his critique of Oswald Spengler's <i>Decline of the West </i>(1918–22), Lewis is prepared to accept Spengler's identification of Nietzsche as simply Darwinian: "That Nietzsche's thundering and screaming is purely 'darwinian': that Darwin means 'Progress of the Species' (what Carlyle thundered about): that seems quite true" (<i>TWM</i>, 286).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Later in <i>Time and Western Man</i>, Lewis again identifies Nietzsche's failings: "Nietzsche had very little in his composition of the health, balance, measure, and fine sense of the antique world (of Spengler's 'Classical' and Goethe's before him) towards which he turned so often: he had much more of the frantic, intolerant fanaticism of a genevan reformer or an Old Testament prophet" (<i>TWM</i>, 352). Ultimately, however, it is Nietzsche's <i>solution</i> to the experience of nihilism that Lewis will reject, not his epochal diagnosis of it: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>the very fundamental question of whether we should set out to transcend our human condition (as formerly Nietzsche and Bergson claimed that we should); or whether we should translate into human terms the whole of our datum. My standpoint is that we are creatures of a certain kind, with no indication that a radical change is imminent; and that the most pretentious of our present prophets is unable to do more than promise an "eternity of intoxication" to those who follow him into less physical, more "cosmic," regions; proposals made with at least equal eloquence by the contemporaries of Plato.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In an irony the measure of which it is far from easy to take, Nietzsche, the first great diagnostician of nihilism, becomes its very incarnation, in the very solution he proposes to it. That this notion will only reinforce itself in the course of Lewis's development is apparent from the following remark in <i>Rude Assignment</i>: "It is most necessary to make it very clear that there is not the least taint of <i>Uebermenschlichkeit</i> anywhere in my mind" (<i>RA</i>, 203). That the notion of the "Overman" would be considered a "taint" by Lewis can be explained by his own attempt to free himself from the taint of fascism. As he makes clear in <i>The Hitler Cult</i> , Lewis considers the Nietzsche who theorizes the "Overman" as an "ancestor" of Nazism. Having quoted approvingly a passage on the "good European" from Nietzsche's <i>The Gay Science</i> (1882; revised edition, 1887), Lewis states: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is mere impudence on the part of the Nazi doctrinaires to claim a man with such views as these as a precursor: though, of course, Nietzsche was a dual personality. There was a side of him that conforms to the Nazi pattern. Whereas one-half of him reviled the empty imperialism imposed by Prussia upon the rest of Germany—"that system of politics which makes the German nation barren, by making it vain"—the other half allowed itself to become intoxicated with hallucinations of power. So it was that he became the outstanding prophet of war-for-war's-sake. He gave intellectual currency to the military dictum of the Prussian—that what we call "peace" is merely intervals interrupting a state of war. As such the Nazi imperialist can claim him as an ancestor.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">According to Lewis, then—whose own intoxications or hallucinations regarding Nazism he is attempting to leave behind in <i>The Hitler Cult</i>—Nietzsche anticipates Nazism precisely through his response or solution to the threat of nihilism, not through his 

<b></b>

 <i>diagnosis</i> of nihilism, and, above all, not through his <i>appropriation</i> of the concept of nihilism from the discourse of the political (that is, nineteenth-century Russian nihilism) and his redeployment of that concept within philosophy. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Lewis and the Struggle Against Modern European Nihilism 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>It would not be particularly difficult to demonstrate that Lewis's entire oeuvre is in fact nothing less than an unremitting critique of nihilism in one form or another. In this respect, one might argue that the influence of Nietzsche upon him remains absolute. Certainly, Lewis's critique of the "time-philosophers" and the "time-mind" in <i>Time and Western Man</i> can be read as a critique of nihilism, given that for Lewis that which is hypostatized by the modern "time-mind" is quite simply "Nothing": "Time as change was the 'Nothing' of the Greek, and it is ours. <i>Space</i> is rapidly, under the guidance of a series of Bergsons, each Time-obsessed, becoming the 'Nothing' of the modern European" (<i>TWM</i>, 418). As mentioned above, however, Lewis first devotes a sustained analysis to a phenomenon that he explicitly terms "nihilism" in the 1929 essay "The Diabolical Principle." This essay is a response to an article by Elliot Paul entitled "The New Nihilism," published in the second issue (May 1927) of the Paris-based magazine <i>transition</i>, of which Paul was, together with Eugene Jolas, the coeditor.  </p>

<p>In "The New Nihilism," Paul claims that a new movement in the arts has finally declared itself, a "new Nihilism" that enacts a productive negation of all existing literary forms, values, and institutions. These new nihilists include Stein and Joyce, but they find their most explicit spokesperson in the French writer Pierre Drieu La Rochelle (1893–1945), the first chapter of whose work <i>Le Jeune Européen</i> (<i>The Young European</i>) was published in an English translation by Elliot Paul in the same issue of <i>transition</i>. For Paul, then, "nihilism" is not a pejorative term, as it is for Lewis, but rather to be associated with nineteenth-century Russian nihilism in the sense that it breaks with the existing institutions (for Russian nihilism these institutions were principally political; for the "new Nihilism" they are aesthetic, moral, and metaphysical as well). Through a productive negation, "new Nihilism" breaks with the "humanist" or "Christian" conception of man and with the literary forms that correspond to that humanism. According to Paul, Drieu La Rochelle's "young European" is nihilist in his absolute rejection of the "Christian spirit," those "old values" of universal "brotherhood" that have been exposed by the inhuman horrors of the First World War. La Rochelle's "nihilism" reflects the "perfect inhumanity" that has come to light with the war. His is a literature that is "completely dehumanized" and functions "in a sphere which knows neither morals nor compassion." This dehumanization is not to be confused, however, with the superhumanization theorized by Nietzsche: "The new hero neither feels nor shows superiority, only an utter amorality and a clear head which finds futility everywhere and accepts it as a natural law." The "new Nihilism" "renounces Christ and Nietzsche as if both were schoolboys."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The extracts from Paul's own translation of the opening chapter of Drieu La Rochelle's <i>Young European</i> that are included in Paul's essay on "The New Nihilism"

 undoubtedly exhibit traits that foreshadow La Rochelle's subsequent commitment to fascism and his rejection of both liberal democracy and communism:<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  </p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Lewis's critique of Paul's argument in favor of a "new Nihilism" forms part of his ongoing polemic against all the major modernists, a polemic that finds its first major expression in <i>Time and Western Man</i>, which contains a long essay on <i>Ulysses</i>, and is reinforced in a sequence of essays on Hemingway, Faulkner, Pound, Eliot, James, and Woolf in <i>Men Without Art</i> . There are numerous aspects to Lewis's critique, but not the least of these is his claim that the "new Nihilism" is in fact not new at all. Just as the other so-called moderns are, in Lewis's eyes, rooted in the nineteenth century and, beyond that, in the "time-philosophy" which is itself nihilist through and through, so the "new Nihilism" does not go beyond the Russian nihilism from which it borrows its name, and (within the literary) it does no more than repeat such nineteenth-century diabolists as Lautréamont and Rimbaud. Lewis places particular emphasis upon the link between Lautréamont (and the other "diabolical" writers) and Nietzsche: in both, he argues, there is a "will to power" or a "power-complex" that operates through a simple reversal of the Christian ethos, a reversal that changes nothing at all. Christian and anti-Christian are two sides of the one nihilist coin: "Such men as [Lautréamont] are in fact inverted moralists, as was well seen in the case of Nietzsche."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  If the writers associated with the "revolution of the word" heralded by <i>transition</i> magazine are merely "sham revolutionaries," repeating the diabolism of Lautréamont <i>et alia</i>, then the "new Nihilists" are quite simply the old nihilists in avant-garde artists' clothing. </p>

<p>No less important to Lewis's critique, however, is the claim that, for all Nietzsche's appropriation of the term for a philosophical discourse, nihilism cannot in fact be freed from its roots in the political. For this reason, Paul's championing of a "new Nihilism" is quite simply a <i>politicization of art</i>, and that, for Lewis, is the most disastrously nihilistic gesture of all. Indeed, according to Lewis, the very essence of modern European nihilism lies precisely in the politicization of art, the negation of art's autonomy from the political as the discourse of the <i>polis</i>: "The <i>politicisation</i> of art is a catastrophe of the same order as the politicisation of science" (<i>E</i>, 68). According to Lewis, then, nihilism is political in its essence, and this is true not only of the "Russian Nihilism" critiqued by both Turgenev in <i>Fathers and Sons</i>  and Dostoevsky in <i>The Possessed</i> , 

<b></b>

 but also of the "new Nihilism" of Drieu La Rochelle's <i>Young European</i>. In fact, Lewis's entire oeuvre is unified by the attempt to save art from the political, to save the creative intellect (as subject, mind, or psyche) in its freedom. As the ostensibly disparate analyses of <i>Time and Western Man</i> make clear, he sees this freedom as being threatened in the modern period by a host of mechanist theories: these include, but are certainly not limited to, Leibniz's concept of the unconscious, Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will, Darwin's theory of the struggle for existence, Nietzsche's will to power, Bergson's concept of <i>élan vital</i>, Spengler's historicism, William James's theory of the stream of consciousness, and behaviorist psychology. What "The Diabolical Principle" helps to clarify is that, above all, it is in the politicization of art, and of the creative intellect that finds expression in art, that modern European nihilism (as Lewis conceives of it) finds its essence, and this is because modernity is for Lewis the "political age," while art remains (transhistorically) the purest form of expression for the intellect in its freedom. In short, the struggle against nihilism in the modern age is, for Lewis, above all the struggle—or the <i>polemos</i>—between art and politics. </p>

<p>Nihilism, as Lewis conceives it, then, is to be understood not as a spirit of negation directed against the Christian humanist conception of humanity as a "brotherhood," not as amorality or lack of compassion, and not even (indeed, above all not) as the inhuman, a category that Lewis aims to recuperate for his own art of satire, together with the idea of the "non-moral," in <i>Men Without Art</i>. Rather, nihilism will be defined by Lewis as the negation of art's autonomy, the contamination of both art and the intellect by the political. What Lewis in "The Diabolical Principle" terms the "New Philistine," by which he means, among others, Elliot Paul, Eugene Jolas, and those writers championed by <i>transition</i>, is, then, closely akin to the old "Philistine" of Matthew Arnold's <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>  in that, just as the Arnoldian "Philistine" fails to achieve disinterestedness, Lewis's "New Philistine" fails to recognize art's necessary autonomy from the political, to recognize that "to root politics out of art is a highly necessary undertaking" (<i>E</i>, 28–29). As for Lewis's own political position in this attack on a nihilism defined as the politicization of art, it is presented as not really a position at all, but rather as hybrid, miscegenated, or self-contradictory: "partly communist and partly fascist, with a distinct streak of monarchism in my marxism, but at bottom anarchist with a healthy passion for order" (<i>E</i>, 70). </p>

<p>That said, the radical distinction between art and politics, intellect and action, thought and power, upon which Lewis's notion of modern European nihilism is founded, is a distinction that cannot be maintained, precisely because the very concept of nihilism itself cannot be freed from the political. To speak of nihilism is always to speak of the political as well as the philosophical and the aesthetic, and in Lewis this imbrication occurs principally through his reliance upon the concept of sovereignty in his thinking of both art and politics in the 1930s. His definition of nihilism as the politicization of art is proposed in the 1929 issue of <i>The Enemy</i> and published in book form (together with another essay, "The Dithyrambic Spectator") in 1931, at the beginning of a decade that would see Lewis address contemporary politics head-on, in a sequence of works whose arguments would come to serve as the principal evidence for 

<b></b>

 the irreducible implication of his own art in the political. Those works include <i>Hitler</i> , <i>Left Wings over Europe; or, How to Make a War About Nothing</i> , and <i>Count Your Dead: They are Alive!, or A New War in the Making</i> . These three texts, in which (as Lewis himself later acknowledges) Hitler and Nazism are treated sympathetically, have been described by Julian Symons as "the worst of Lewis" (<i>EWL</i>, 124), and Lewis himself came to dismiss aspects of them. In an unpublished draft chapter of <i>Rude Assignment</i>, he claims that the Nazis' nationalism "bored" him, their "racism" he considered a "joke," and their militarism was "silly," but he admits to having "felt much sympathy" (<i>RA</i>, 258) for both their economic program (in particular, their attack on usury, or "loan-capital" as opposed to "creative-capital") and their social program. Crucially, Lewis relies upon the notions (and the value) of sovereignty and the nation-state in his defence of Nazism, a defence energized by his anticommunism. In <i>Left Wings over Europe</i>, for instance, which was published after German troops had entered the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, he argues that Hitler's principal aim is simply the re-establishment of Germany as a "sovereign state, within its own frontiers, subject to its own law."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  It is just such a sovereignty that, for Lewis, is also the defining principle of the intellect or creative intelligence and the art in which it finds not only its expression but also its being as transhistorical event. </p>

<p>That Lewis would eventually come to realize the problems entailed by deploying the concept of sovereignty in his thinking of the political is evident from his remarks upon <i>Hitler</i> and <i>Left Wings over Europe</i> in <i>Rude Assignment</i>: he is now "in complete disagreement with much of the contents of <i>Left Wings</i>," in particular its "support for the principle of the 'sovereign state'" and "its antagonism to all centralization of power" (<i>RA</i>, 226). Lewis continues to insist, however, that neither work is political; rather, they are "anti-war" (<i>RA</i>, 224). What he has come to realize is that sovereignty and war are inextricable: "until the doctrine of the 'sovereign state' is repudiated, there must be war" (<i>RA</i>, 225). In fact, this rejection of sovereignty as a political principle is already apparent in <i>The Hitler Cult</i>: "The more 'sovereign states' that cease to be sovereign the better for all of us. And it is not perhaps too much to hope that the fact of a common tongue, English, will start the rot; disintegrate these stupid barriers" (<i>HC</i>, 244). And yet, far from simply abandoning the notion of the state, Lewis proceeds to universalize it: abandoning the ideal of multiple sovereign states, he comes to advocate a federalist world-state as the only solution to both the possibility of war and the dissolution of "Western culture," that culture being something he no longer sees any reason to defend. And if the principle of sovereignty remains at the heart of any thinking of a world-state, it also remains at the heart of Lewis's thinking of the aesthetic in its absolute autonomy from the political.  </p>

<p>If the struggle against nihilism as Lewis conceives it calls for a rooting out of politics from art, the works of the 1930s suggest that it also calls for a rooting out of politics from the discourse of the political. In the foreword to <i>Left Wings over Europe</i>, for instance, Lewis writes: "Finally, as to the political colours under which what you are about to read sails. With regard to that I can set your mind at rest at once. I fly the flag of no party. My shirt is neither red, black, nor purple."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  And yet, Lewis's anticommunism drives

 him inexorably towards a position-taking that is necessarily political. <i>Hitler</i>, <i>Left Wings over Europe</i>, and <i>Count Your Dead</i> may be "anti-war," but that is precisely because a European war would, according to Lewis, result in communist hegemony in Europe. In an article published in the <i>British Union Quarterly</i> in January 1937 and addressed quite directly to the British fascist, Lewis insists upon his being "objective" and "detached." Studiously refusing to identify himself as a fascist, he nonetheless identifies Marxism as an "enormous evil" and communism as a "dark apotheosis," whereas fascism stands for "all that prospers by individual effort and creative toil."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Ironically, the explicit connection that Lewis makes here between politics and the aesthetic (that is, "creative toil") is a perfect reflection of their imbrication in the Marxist theory of the aesthetic. The irony only deepens when one considers the fact that, while Lewis insists in each of his "anti-war" polemics of the mid-1930s that he is remaining "objective," his first polemic against Nazism (<i>The Hitler Cult</i>) opens with the announcement that he is finally abandoning his political neutrality (<i>HC</i>, vii). </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
From <i>transition</i> to Existentialism; or, Nihilism's Return 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>For all the many, highly significant changes that occur at the end of the 1930s in Lewis's position on democracy, fascism, the nation-state and the world-state, and even the value of Western (or at least European) civilization, the concept of nihilism that he inherits from Nietzsche, and redefines to suit his own purposes, survives intact. Over two decades after the first publication of "The Diabolical Principle," in a chapter entitled "Twentieth Century Nihilism" in <i>The Writer and the Absolute</i> , Lewis once again deploys "nihilism" as a catch-all for an entire mode of thinking, namely the existentialism of Sartre and Camus, which he rejects as one more manifestation of that "time-philosophy" which now includes Heidegger, whose <i>Being and Time</i>  would have made him one of Lewis's "most valuable exhibits," had Lewis only read him when writing <i>Time and Western Man</i>.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Whereas in "The Diabolical Principle" nihilism's essence is taken to lie in the politicization of art, or the negation of art's autonomy, in <i>The Writer and the Absolute</i> it appears at first glance to be defined in ontological terms as a philosophy that takes the ultimate ground to be the nothing (<i>le néant</i>). Lewis's critique of Sartrean existentialism echoes his earlier critique of the "dionysian" Nietzsche. Existentialism is nihilistic in being an attack on "human reason"; reason and intellect are supplanted by the will, making of man the "acting animal" rather than the "thinking animal" (<i>WA</i>, 124). This usurpation of reason occurs through a withdrawal from objectivity into subjectivity, from the external into the internal world, a withdrawal that Lewis traces back to the <i>epochï</i> (or bracketing) at the heart of Husserl's phenomenology. What remains after the <i>epochï</i> is, Lewis argues, not consciousness in its purity but nothing, or, more precisely, the consciousness of nothing: "So—having cut himself off from the phenomenal world outside—in this empty shell our Existentialist flings himself on the floor and contemplates this echoless vacuity" (<i>WA</i>, 126). </p>

<p>If Lewis's summary of the phenomenological reduction scarcely does justice to Husserl, it nonetheless appears to enable Lewis to offer a definition of nihilism that is 

<b></b>

 no longer limited to the negation of art through its politicization. However, the more general argument of <i>The Writer and the Absolute</i> is precisely that art must remain free, and that, for all its token emphasis upon freedom, existentialism is a philosophy that conceives of the human as anything but free. As we have seen, according to Lewis, existentialism renders the human being an "acting animal," subject to the will rather than to reason. In other words, existentialism takes its place in the tradition of philosophies of the will that can be traced back to Schopenhauer and his "pessimism." With regard to art and literature, Sartre is of course the great champion of engaged literature (<i>littérature engagée</i>), whereas Lewis continues to maintain art's absolute autonomy from the political: literature, he argues, should be "a kind of Switzerland; the 'great neutral'" (<i>WA</i>, 54).<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The works of Sartre and Malraux are proof that "literature is literally bedeviled by politics in the France of today" (<i>WA</i>, 67). If Camus is to be set apart from Sartre and Malraux as the author of novels that are "probably the best that are being written in France today" (<i>WA</i>, 66), then this is precisely because he is "a writer of great distinction who declares himself as not of any party: or at least desirous of being that." And yet, Lewis continues, "there is nothing in the world so difficult today as not belonging to a party" (<i>WA</i>, 67). </p>

<p>One might well imagine that Lewis's insistence upon the difficulty of maintaining art's autonomy from the political is owing to his own experiences in the 1930s, and yet, once again, the act of autoimmunization that is the signature of Lewisian polemic takes place by way of another, in this instance not Nietzsche but Camus. For all the attention that Lewis pays to Sartre in his critique of existentialism, it is Camus who poses the greater threat and who serves as the re of that self which Lewis would expel, since he bears, or is made by Lewis to bear, such a close resemblance to Lewis himself. Not only does the French-Algerian writer seek to free himself from the political, but he is presented as being, like Lewis, a "thinking animal" rather than a "man-of-action animal" (<i>WA</i>, 69). Ultimately, however, Camus belongs with all the other twentieth-century nihilists, although, crucially, his nihilism lies not in his rendering art political but rather in his conception of the human being as essentially irrational or absurd: in Camus, "the irrational—the Absurd—is an openly venerated principle" (<i>WA</i>, 131); "No work I know of is more beautifully suited to make dazzlingly clear the inner meaning of existentialism than <i>L'Etranger</i>, by Albert Camus. To the 'Dumb Ox' of whom I wrote must now be added the 'Surd'" (<i>WA</i>, 131). </p>

<p>One of the ironies of launching such a critique of Camus—in which it is absurdity and not the political that renders the work nihilist—lies in the fact that in his essay on "The Meaning of the Wild Body" , in which he establishes the fundamental principles for his own comic art, Lewis anticipates the postwar theory of the absurd by turning Bergson's definition of laughter on its head, redefining laughter as a response to the absurdity of being. The absurd, as Lewis conceives it in 1927, is that for which there can be no logical explanation. Thus, not only might a given phenomenon be described as absurd, when considered from a certain point of view, but being as such is fundamentally absurd, given that there can be no logical explanation for its emergence out of non-being: 

<b></b>

 </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>To begin to understand the totality of <i>the absurd</i>, at all, you have to assume much more than belongs to a social differentiation. There is nothing that is animal (and we as bodies are animals) that is not absurd. This sense of the absurdity, or, if you like, the madness of our life, is at the root of every true philosophy.  . . .  It is the chasm lying between being and non-being, over which it is impossible for logic to throw any bridge, that, in certain forms of laughter, we leap. We land plumb in the centre of Nothing.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">If, from a point of philosophical vantage, being as a whole is absurd, then it goes without saying that the human being is. According to Lewis, however, the absurdity of the human lies not only in its being as such, but also in its status as a <i>thinking</i> being. If his theory of the absurd is rooted in a dualist sense of the absolute difference between being and non-being, then his theory of the comic is rooted in a no less dualist sense of the absolute distinction between action and reason, will and thought. Just as the leap from non-being to being is absurd on account of its resisting all logical explanation, so too is the leap from body to mind, from will to thought, from action to reason—in other words, the leap beyond nihilism: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The root of the Comic is to be sought in the sensations resulting from the observations of a <i>thing</i> behaving like a person. But from that point of view all men are necessarily comic: for they are all <i>things</i>, or physical bodies, behaving as <i>persons</i>. It is only when you come to deny that they are "persons," or that there is any "mind" or "person" there at all, that the world of appearance is accepted as quite natural, and not at all ridiculous.</p>

	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Whether this "absurd" leap out of nihilism is to be conceived as an action or a thought, as nihilist or non-nihilist, remains in question, not least because its very absurdity lies in its not belonging properly to either category.  </p>

<p>For the absurdity or ridiculousness of being, and of human being in particular, to become apparent, and thereby laughable, there must be a certain distance between the subject and the object of laughter. Human beings are only laughable when viewed from the outside, and indeed from an absolute outside—hence Lewis's insistence that the comic art is necessarily purely "externalist." Paradoxically, this absolute outside, this being-beyond-the-human, is the very essence of the human as a thinking being. That at which we laugh is the human as the properly human's absolute other. To be properly human, then, is to be in a position to laugh at everything we spend our lives mistaking for the human, and this is, if not strictly speaking impossible, not only rare but at odds with life itself: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is comparatively easy to see that another man, as an animal, is absurd; but it is far more difficult to observe oneself in that hard and exquisite light. But no man has ever continued to live who has observed himself in that manner for longer than a flash. Such consciousness must be of the nature of a thunderbolt. Laughter is only summer-lightning. But it occasionally takes on the dangerous form of absolute revelation.</p>
<p>This fundamental self-observation, then, can never on the whole be absolute. We are not constructed to be <i>absolute observers</i>. Where it does not exist at all, men sink to the level of insects. </p>

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->


</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Such properly human laughter is not corrective in the manner that laughter is for Bergson. It does not serve to identify and challenge departures from the normative. Rather, it is on the side of the human beyond any social, political, or normative categories. It is the experience of the human as that which transcends itself; it is a non-position, an absolute outside, the place of art, for which there is simply nothing but alterity. In short, it is life beyond nihilism. And yet, the place of such properly human laughter at the absurdity of thinking being is precisely the nothing of pure consciousness, the very nothing that Lewis will later criticize in Husserl's phenomenology and Sartre's existentialism. </p>

<p>At the heart of Lewis's own conception of an externalist art, then, there is a pure "nothing," and it is upon this "nothing" that his own critique of nihilism is founded. At this point, the very difference between the critique of nihilism and the nihilism that constitutes the object of that critique is subjected to a pressure that threatens to reduce it to nothing. What Nietzsche terms the "uncanniness" ("Unheimlichkeit") of nihilism would lie, then, in that nihilism's returning to haunt the very critique that Lewis would launch against it. In short, Lewis's own oeuvre would appear to serve as proof, against itself, in a <i>polemos</i> of incessantly failing autoimmunization, that there is nothing more nihilist than a critique of nihilism. If Lewis's debt to Nietzsche lies, above all, in his appropriation and redeployment of the concept of nihilism, then the limit to that debt would lie in his failure to take full account of the uncanniness of a guest that would shape his entire oeuvre while also reducing it in its turn to a very strange kind of nothing. That Heidegger exhibits a similar failure is surely rather more than an historical coincidence. </p>

<p>To-day is the day of the novel. In no other day and by no other vehicle is contemporaneous life so adequately expressed; and the critics of the twenty-second century, reviewing our times, striving to reconstruct our civilization, will look not to the painters, not to the architects nor dramatists, but to the novelists to find our idiosyncrasy . . . .

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->



<p>"Go out into the street and stand where the ways cross and hear the machinery of life work clashing in its grooves," Frank Norris charges his fellow novelists in his essay "The Need of a Literary Conscience." "Or look from your window. A whole literature goes marching by, clamoring for a leader and a master hand to guide it."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Norris's self-assured command belies the paradox of calling a centuries-old literary form the key medium of "to-day" in the epigraph. Indeed, by using "machinery" to metonymize the "life" awaiting depiction, he conjures the specters of newer media: the phonograph, still photography, and the machine that haunts his 1899 novel <i>McTeague: A Story of San Francisco</i>, the kinetoscope—"the crowning scientific achievement of the nineteenth century."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  I characterize the kinetoscope's appearance in <i>McTeague</i> as a <i>haunting</i> because it recognizes the novelty of moving pictures but relegates them to the role of a "diversion," 

<b></b>

 a role to which novels, Norris assures us, could never stoop. The moving picture show at the Orpheum vaudeville theater leaves McTeague and his companions "awestruck" by replicating the movement of horses, cable cars, and trucks, but it seems to impress them no more than do the slapstick comedians, "cigar-box fiddle[rs]," and tone-deaf singers who precede it (<i>M</i>, 62). The kinetoscope may offer a staggering mechanical reproduction of visible reality, but it sheds no light on the spirit of the age to this overawed, boisterous audience who come only to be shocked and amused. By contrast, <i>McTeague</i> offers equally detailed descriptions of such settings as McTeague's "dental parlors," his wedding table, the mining cabin where he seeks work after killing his wife, and the vaudeville show itself, but it supplements these descriptions with commentary on the social and psychological currents of working-class life, offered for the enlightenment of refined readers who (Norris assumes) grasp the difference between mechanical imitation and aesthetic craft. </p>

<p><i>McTeague</i>'s kinetoscope, though contained diegetically by the Orpheum and narratively by a single chapter, has more to say about Norris's definition of naturalism than <i>McTeague</i>'s narrator admits. My opening quotes suggest that Norris defined "the novel" by its ability to adapt to changing cultural conditions, including the ascent of new technologies. In what follows, I show that for Norris, stalking the machinery of life meant more than writing technologies and traffic into his fiction. It meant reinventing the novel as a form appropriate to telling the stories of modernity, technology, and mass culture as well as the atavistic extremes of human behavior for which naturalism was notorious in Norris's time. It also meant risking the novel's singularity as a medium by adapting aspects of new representational technologies to outfit its armory of effects. Mark Seltzer has argued that the naturalist novel "devis[ed] a narrative machine that inscribes . . . [social] technologies [of power and biopower] as part of its textual practice." <i>McTeague</i> exemplifies this assessment beautifully, but in a form that speaks directly to the cinema's challenge to the cultural authority of the novel: a narrative of intermedia mutiny in which the incorporated medium surreptitiously turns the tables on its elder. The challenge of expressing "adequately" the early cinema and the social relations and quotidian experience of American culture in which it participated curtails <i>McTeague</i>'s capacity to "coordinate," as Seltzer would have it, the bodies of its characters and the machine of the cinema "within a single technology of regulation."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In other words, Norris's peculiar naturalist aesthetic (and it should be noted that, despite its critical champions then and now, "American naturalism" in the 1890s was less a movement than a jumble of proffered peculiarities) owes its shape in part to the pressures that the cinematic imagination exerted upon his notion of the forms and roles the traditional arts must take in the new century. I suggest that the early cinema weighed heavily enough upon Norris's conception of the novel's future that to put his aesthetic into practice, as he did most aggressively in <i>McTeague</i>, was to transform the cinema from an inscribed technology—a form of representational, social, and industrial power that naturalism could, ideally, narrate and contextualize among other forces—to one which inscribes itself upon naturalism to the point of twisting the latter into a literary refraction of the cinema itself.

 </p>

<p>One of the few critics to deal with cinematic discourse in <i>McTeague</i>, Alfred G. Litton, points out that <i>McTeague </i>gets the name of the Orpheum's projector wrong. Mac and his future in-laws could not have watched images projected by a <i>kinetoscope</i>, because kinetoscopes displayed film loops in single-serve peephole arcade machines, not on auditorium screens for masses of spectators (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Litton suggests that by calling the projector a kinetoscope rather than a vitascope (or another of its many proprietary names, such as Eidoloscope or Biograph), Norris derides everyone from slow-witted McTeague to the Orpheum publicists for their inability to keep up with technological change.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  But Litton neglects two facts: first, the Edison company used the name "Projecting Kinetoscope" to market its own projectors beginning in 1897 (. <a href="#2">2</a> and <a href="#3">3</a>); and second, Norris alludes to "the kinetoscope" numerous times in his criticism as an idealized metaphor for naturalist fiction.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> The ideal, kinetoscopic novel that collectively emerges from these allusions is engineered, if you will, for what I call <i>telling descriptions</i>, that is, narrating stories via discrete, concrete images while obscuring the overt traces of narration as a discursive act. Whether he intended to shuffle the names or not, or was simply reporting the name he saw on Orpheum advertisements in 1897 or after, Norris's use of the term <i>kinetoscope</i> instead of <i>vitascope</i> invites us to attend more closely to the cinematic context of Norris's idealized naturalism.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  As I will discuss, Norris predicted, or rather prescribed, novels that could capture not merely <i>vita</i>, "life" in an abstract and reified form, but also the <i>kineticism</i> of American life, "clashing in its grooves" in the streets of urban modernity, and the multiple and fragmentary perspectives from which the modern subject perceived it. But this target proved elusive, and the search for it potentially damaging, to a medium lacking images and moving parts at a time when mechanization affected every sphere of modern life—including the consumption of fiction. </p>

<p>If for Stendhal the novel was a mirror walking down the road, one may be excused for assuming that Norris wanted to supplant the mirror with a camera. American naturalism, Michael Davitt Bell writes, drew from Zola's purportedly scientific theory of the novel the "promise of a reality unmediated by language, a direct transmission of 'real' life in which style remains transparent . . . . [A]nything that makes us aware of the writer as writer—or . . . makes the <i>writer aware</i> that he <i>is</i> a writer, a mediator—damages the goods."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Though one must be skeptical of general claims about such an idiosyncratic genre as American naturalism, Davitt Bell's appraisal matches up fairly neatly with Norris's own critical calls for the "removal of the author as personality and for the communication of theme through scene and action" alone.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In Norris's own words: "The man behind the pen—what has the public to do with him? The more he differentiates himself from his story, the more remote his isolation, the more real will appear the things and people of which he treats, the more will his story seem to have a life of its own."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> </p>

<p>Photography provided Gilded Age literary critics with a convenient metaphor for this zero degree of style, as when Harold Fredric praised the imagery in Stephen Crane's novel, <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> , by comparing it to the motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge: "At last, along comes a Muybridge, with his instantaneous

<p>As one might expect, Norris picks up the strain of Fredric's photography metaphor on multiple occasions. But rather than holding up photography as a model for artistry, Norris joined the gainsayers who fretted over realist fiction's focus on visual detail.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  According to Daniel Borus, the critic W. H. Thayer accused realists from Crane to the more staid William Dean Howells for founding an "Epidermis School" of authors who "sought to accumulate so much detail [as] to 'produce as sure an effect of reality as genius produced by using a few essentials," while Hamilton Wright Mabie complained that "observation, the method of science," was no replacement for "insight" and hard-earned skills of intuition when it came to excavating the reasons and meanings hidden beneath the skin of everyday life.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  For his part, Norris asserts that "most people" mistake Zola's "Naturalism . . . [for] an inner circle of realism . . . a theory of fiction wherein things are represented 'as they really are,' with the truthfulness of a camera." In fact, Norris avers, Zola's naturalism comes closer to "Romance" than to 

<b></b>

 photorealism, because it concerns itself not with trifling visual details but with the "world of big things; the enormous, the formidable, the terrible . . . no teacup tragedies here."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  "Teacup tragedies" refers to Norris's infamous complaint that Howells's novels, crowded with "crises involving cups of tea," simply could not accommodate more consequential crises, such as the outbursts of sexual desire, greed, envy, and murder that drive McTeague to his fate: from "stupid," satisfied bachelorhood and romancing Trina Sieppe, through her winning $5,000 in a lottery, their marriage, and the loss of his dental practice, to his murdering Trina for her money and his showdown with her cousin Marcus in Death Valley, where he ends up handcuffed to Marcus's corpse, dying of thirst without a tea tray in sight. </p>

<p>Norris's critique of Howells, snide as it sounds, needs to be understood less as a complaint (Howells was in fact a champion of Norris's work) than as a plea to readers to differentiate realism from naturalism according to how <i>description</i> functions in each genre.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  When realists load their pages with "the smaller details of every-day life," they achieve what Norris terms "Accuracy" rather than "Truth," for "the most scrupulous adherence to fact, even when narrated with the meticulous science of the phonograph or pictured with the incontestable precision of the photograph," can never familiarize readers with "the broad truth of the thing . . . the words [people] would have spoken" at times of mortal crisis "if only they could have given expression to <i>his</i> thoughts"—that is, the author's thoughts—about the event depicted (emphasis added).<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> </p>

<p>This last remark, in which Norris champions the expression of "broad truth" over thick description, seems to counter the notion that Norris incorporated cinema into his theory of naturalism. In particular, his faith in the truth-value of an author's purely vicarious experience of disaster smacks of anti-empiricism if not class condescension. But by the 1890s, photography had come to metonymize perceptual possibilities beyond the accretion of what Oliver Wendell Holmes had called the stereograph's "frightful amount of detail."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Michael North argues that photography was an attractive medium for the first modernist painters and poets not because of its iconicity, but because of how photographs "bridge the gap between language and visible phenomena by making a language <i>of</i> visible phenomena."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  North characterizes the drive to gather, process, and frame random traces of material, temporal reality—wallpaper and newspaper swatches, blobs of paint that call attention to when and how they were applied, advertising posters and the like—as both inherently modernist and inherently photographic. This drive recognizes all of "ordinary reality" as elements of a modern aesthetic that only awaits the artist to commit it to, or rather leave its record upon, a more traditional medium.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Norris's literary criticism channels a parallel impulse in that it presses for an <i>epistemologically</i> realist fiction, one that depends less upon faithful descriptions of people, objects, or settings than upon transmitting a sensation of stumbling upon the real akin to that triggered by running across a snapshot. In "Fiction is Selection," Norris backs an Aristotelian model of verisimilitude in which the author must use "facts" sparingly, because some facts might "seem like a rehash of some tawdry yellow-covered romance of fifty or a hundred years ago. Fiction is what <i>seems</i> real, not what <i>is</i> real."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  For readers to accept an event as real, Norris argues, it must be plausible, 

<b></b>

 unencumbered by any implication that it was shaped for some "literary" purpose—and readers must accept its truth-value as automatically as they accept the indexicality of a photograph. To twist Norris's parallelism a bit, Norris does not want naturalism to <i>be</i> photographic, but to <i>seem</i> photographic. </p>

<p>In order to foster such impressions, Norris's ideal novelist must never invent anything, but rather must collect, frame, and juxtapose frozen fragments of real events. Later in "Fiction is Selection," he portrays this novelist as </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>a maker of mosaics in front of a vast pile of tiny many-colored blocks. He doesn't make the blocks nor color them—the storywriter does not invent nor imagine the parts of his story. Writer and mosaicist alike select and combine. The maker of a mosaic has a design in his brain, or, better still, infinitely better, sees in the pile of little colored blocks in front of him a certain little group . . . that, by merest accident, has tumbled into a design of its own . . . much more original than any design he could work out.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p class="continued">For all the stress he places on the "suppression of the author's personality," Norris insistently characterizes the author as a skilled mediator between "life" and readers who wish to confront that life in fiction. This rative mosaicist's skills resemble those of the photographer whose images result from what filmmaker Maya Deren later called the "controlled accidents" of photographic artistry, the selection and framing of what one finds in the visual field into a collage of things that communicates both the things found and the photographer's intent in framing them.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  For Norris, the difference between a novelist and a recording device is that the latter can never produce a record that explains itself: "[I]f in spite of all willful self-suppression the point of view of the writer—his ideals, his ideas, his personality, in a word—does not appear in his work indirectly—mind I say indirectly—he had best give over the attempt to produce readable fiction; as well have the cinematograph and the phonograph."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> </p>

<p>The cinema functions here as a re for naturalism's bad object lesson, the author as an idiot savant who merely reproduces sense data. The comparison with cinema illustrates how inclusive the naturalist's eye must become while setting a limit on how objectively the naturalist should represent what that eye has seen. But the allusion to moving pictures also betrays Norris's keen interest in mass culture in general, and the cinema in particular. As both author and San Francisco flaneur, Norris was fascinated by contemporary realities that most middle- and highbrow fiction shunned, including sensationalist mass culture like street fairs, vaudeville, and lurid pulp novels.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Whereas Howells dismissed "dime-novel" authors as hacks paid by the word to sensationalize violence and lionize characters who stumble into success rather than earning it, Norris reminded his readers that a growing fiction market some "70,000,000" strong had to have something to read, and claimed they were better off reading boy's-adventure series like <i>Deadwood Dick</i> than shooting dice in the alley: "a bad book—that is to say, a poor, cheap, ill-written, 'trashy' book—is not after all so harmful as 'no book' at all."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Norris's condescending tone here belies the allure that "romantic" plots and characters held for him; one need look no further for this than McTeague himself, the "young giant" whose "mallet"-like fists (<i>M</i>, 6) finally pummel Trina to death for 

<b></b>

 the lottery jackpot she has socked away. Only the truly masterful novelist can unify such diverse and artless fragments of modernity—"low" culture amusement, picnic outings, atavistic violence, and all—into a unified aesthetic whole that yet manages to reflect that diversity: "Little by little he pieces together that crude and rough design, gets everything to fit, everything to harmonize . . . . A little polishing, very little, for in roughness there is strength and in sharp contrast, vividness; and there you are, a rounded whole, a definite, compact and complete thing . . . ."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> </p>

<p>As much as the mosaic allegory emphasizes the indispensability of the mosaicist, however, characterizing the author as framer and selector threatens to reduce the virtual presence of the author before the reader. As an ambitious professional writer with a market stake in gaining and retaining cultural authority, Norris could not afford to wipe all traces of his shaping presence from his work: "Because [the novel] is so all-powerful to-day, the people turn to him who wields this instrument with every degree of confidence."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  But if naturalists achieved their strongest effects by disappearing, what, exactly, would keep their unique sensibilities before the public in their fiction? An implicit answer lies in Norris's more forgiving critical reflections on the cinema, in which the erstwhile bad object emerges as a model for the arrangement of discrete scenes. Of an early scene in Crane's <i>Maggie: A Girl of the Streets</i> (1893, republished 1896), in which Maggie's brother Jimmie rams his horse-drawn truck forward through Bowery traffic, Norris writes: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The picture he makes is not a single carefully composed painting, serious, finished, scrupulously studied, but rather scores and scores of tiny flashlight photographs, instantaneous, caught, as it were, on the run. Of a necessity, then, the movement of his tale must be rapid, brief, very hurried, hardly more than a glimpse . . . . At first one is tempted to believe that it is a "long exposure," but on second thought I conclude that it is merely a great number of snap-shots taken at the same subject.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Norris, like Fredric in his <i>Red Badge</i> review, seems to have Muybridge's motion studies in mind; Crane's narrator leaps from image to image and scene to scene as if producing a series of discontinuous images of a continuous motion.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Unlike Fredric, however, Norris attributes the motion here to the "flashlight photographer" who is himself "on the run," rather than to the subject. This man on the run bristles with the energy of urban modernity as described by Georg Simmel in 1903 as "the rapid crowding of changing images, the sharp discontinuity in the grasp of a single glance, and the unexpectedness of onrushing impression," and as Ben Singer writes, such "preoccupation with the sensory intensity of urban life can be found in every genre and class of social representation in this period . . . ."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  When Norris asks in 1897, "Where is the man that shall . . . go a-gunning for stories up and down our streets and into our houses and parlors and lodging houses and saloons and dives and along our wharves and into our theaters; yes, and into the secretest chambers of our homes as well as our hearts?" he seems to be describing both an ideal author-re and a contemporary cameraman.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> </p>

<p>This author-re, like Norris's fantasy of Crane as photographer and like the roving camera operators for the Lumières, dips into and out of the streets taking snapshots 

<b></b>

 without discriminating between the polite and the brutal, the private and the public, and takes particular note of the bustle and push of the masses: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In the manner of Baudelaire's stroller, the [Lumière] cameraman chooses the crowd as his privileged territory. Micromovements, flux and reflux, attitudes and faces of anonymous passers-by, clothing and accessories of beautiful ladies, children's games: so many fleeting and transitory phenomena that provide material for his inspection, at the same time delineating the contours of his sphere of intervention.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">But the filmmaker had already surpassed the author in this search to catalog the elements of modern hyperstimulus by the time <i>McTeague</i> was published in 1899. During most of the scant decade of Norris's career as a novelist, moving picture shows linked city streets, onrushing trains, parades, violent slapstick gags, panoramic shots of rivers from the Seine to New York City's North River, historical executions, and hundreds of other subjects in the form of fifty-second films screened with little regard for continuity or theme.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The films of the Lumière Brothers, whose portable <i>cinématographe</i> allowed them to document outdoor events and street scenes that the Edison company's heavy and bulky apparatus often missed, were first screened in San Francisco at the Orpheum in August 1897.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  If Norris based any of his Orpheum scene on the Lumière screenings, which is entirely possible, he would have seen the French beating the Americans to the naturalist punch yet again, this time in their cinematic denotation of "life as it is lived" right down to the reproduction of a horse champing at its bit in <i>New York, Broadway et Union Square</i>  or one of many other street <i>actualités</i> the Lumières produced (<a href="#4"> 4</a>).<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> </p>

<p>Norris develops his ideal of peripatetic authorship explicitly in terms of such cinematic capture. In 1897 he writes in praise of contemporary "short-story men" who "strike off an incident or two, clean-cut, sharp, decisive, and brief, suggesting everything that is to follow and everything that precedes." Achieving such effects "demands an originality and ingenuity on the part of the author that is nothing short of abnormal . . . . [The story] must be told in sentences that are almost pictures in themselves. The whole tale must resemble, as one might say, the film of a kinetoscope, a single action made up from a multitude of view points."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  In "From Dawn to Dark—ting," an undated report on the Spanish-American War of 1898, Norris parallels this authorial peripatesis to the mosaicist's sensibility when he describes the fate of those non-dramatic events that pass before his imaginary camera: "The events of the next two or three days came back to the imagination without the connecting links that intervened . . . . Only the essentials, the striking pictures, remain, as though one were looking at a Kinetoscope in which gaps—fortunately of no importance—had occurred in the films."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Here the novelist processes his memories of war through the discourse of moving pictures, which mimicked not the "real" continuity of time and space but rather the modern subject's <i>experience</i> of reality by screening heterogeneous films in distracting circumstances—think of <i>McTeague</i>'s Orpheum show, presenting unrelated acts to a crowd that never stops talking—that heightened their discontinuity. The process of viewing films under such conditions provides an analogy for the perception and recollection of only those events that make the profoundest impact on the audience.

<p>Norris's kinetoscopic dream of naturalism exploits the possibilities of this analogy. But we must remember that these examples also represent a fantasized version of moving pictures that differs from the historical early cinema, most notably in terms of producers' control over the meanings of films for their audiences. As Seltzer points out, Norris's "The Mechanics of Fiction" (in its 1899 version) imbues the naturalist with an engineer's powers to systematize the processing of facts: "The great story of the whole novel is told thus as it were in a series of pictures, the author supplying information as to what had intervened."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  When Norris imagines the new "short-story" men filming a "single action" from multiple perspectives, he envisions a film the likes of which had never been seen in 1897, one which would supply information not only about non-dramatic events, but also about how to see an event as the objective author ostensibly does: not from one point of view rooted to a single spot or a single set of interests, but from all sides. Had such an authorial force supplied such connections at the Orpheum, the moving picture display might have left Mac and his party cheering the superiority of American technology instead of chattering about the kinetoscope's sensational effects or wondering if it were all a "drick," as Mrs. Sieppe calls it—a trick played to fool the masses into thinking they watched real events rather than a simulation.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The masses are attracted to this new technology just as the novelist is, but the Orpheum chapter portrays them as in dire need of a "leader and master hand to guide" their encounters with it. The trick for the naturalist is to provide that guidance covertly, exchanging "friendly" storytelling for impersonal narration with a cinematographic sheen. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>But Norris does not make that trick look easy. <i>McTeague</i>'s Orpheum scene stages a clash between Norris's cinematic imagination and the historical cinema in that it showcases the cinema's terrific powers of mimesis in what Norris characterizes as a space completely evacuated of aesthetic judgment. The narrator misses no chance to expose the pretended sophistication of the vaudeville offerings, placing scare quotes around the performers' titles ("artists," "musicians," "The Society Contralto") and interposing such ironic asides as "'Home, Sweet Home' played upon a trombone. Think of that! Art could go no farther."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Norris further emphasizes the distance between "low" and "high" culture simply by describing the vaudeville acts—acrobats, slapstick sketches, vocal and instrumental acts, and a ventriloquist—in all their diversity. Norris's ideal of a kinetoscopic naturalism requires selection and unity of effect. The vaudeville revue replaces that ideal with a dual fetish of pure effect on the one hand, and on the other a radical disunity on the order of the photograph's equalization of all details regardless of their significance—the same tendency that inspires Norris to refuse the analogy between naturalism and still photography. </p>

<p>The Orpheum's climactic unveiling of the kinetoscope would seem to represent the nadir of vaudeville's anti-aesthetic of attractions and distractions. As Litton notes, in the face of the kinetoscope views, McTeague "is incapable of forming any judgment. . . . He is a mere passive observer whose own language reflects the fact that he can only react to the phenomenon, not evaluate it: 'Look at that horse move his head. . . . Look at that cable-car coming—and the man going across the street. See, here comes a truck'."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  But one can scarcely hold Mac's dimwittedness solely responsible for his stunned reactions. What Tom Gunning calls the early cinema's "aesthetic of astonishment," its stress of distraction and sensation over continuity and unity, drew laughs, gasps, squeals, and dumbfounded silence from viewers of all classes.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Noël Burch specifies the Lumières' version of this aesthetic as "polycentrism": </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>[N]either the street scenes nor the other general views . . . offer the reader's guide that would allow their complex content to be grasped and enumerated . . . .

<p class="continued">Norris presents the historical kinetoscopic film as an "art" form that trumps photography's capacity to fill the eye with new details and new stimulations by putting still images into motion, but also a form that, like its viewers, has no capacity for hierarchizing perception.  </p>

<p>When read as a volley in Norris's discursive battle to legitimate naturalism, then, the Orpheum scene functions to project <i>McTeague</i>'s potential implication in the waning of taste on to the primal scene of cinema and mass culture. But confining the kinetoscope to a single chapter does little to contain the more complex connotations of writerly craft and force that Norris attaches to it. <i>McTeague</i> evinces the return of the kinetoscopic repressed in subplots that imagine a very different future for American naturalists than Norris the critic predicts, one in which quasi-cinematic objectivity overwhelms their 

<b></b>

 tenuous authority as "makers" of narrative mosaics. In this scenario, the storyteller who exchanges narratorial presence for impersonal and objective description runs the risk of losing any of the novelist's authority to <i>interpret</i> what the descriptions represent. One subplot in particular focuses on an act of storytelling, and specifically on the dangers of "mechanical" description. Zerkow, a stereotypically miserly Jew, becomes obsessed with a story, told by Maria, a stereotypically flighty Spanish maid with a "diseased imagination," about a long-lost set of gold dishes—a story the narrator, protesting incomplete knowledge, will not dismiss as mere fantasy: "Was Maria actually remembering some reality of a childhood of barbaric luxury? . . . It was not impossible. Of Maria Macapa's past . . . absolutely nothing could be learned" (<i>M</i>, 30). Maria, as if in a trance, repeats the story verbatim whenever Zerkow requests it, leading him to become hysterical for the gold service—or rather, for the image of the service that her retellings produce. "There were more than a hundred pieces, and every one of them gold," the description begins, and she repeats it no fewer than four times after the first telling. But Zerkow is not the only one impressed with Maria's story. The narrator intervenes to suggest that the rich details of her description reflect the quality of her mental picture, which she avers she "can see . . . just as plain": "Illiterate enough, unimaginative enough on all other subjects, her distorted wits called up this picture with marvelous distinctness. It was plain that she saw the plate clearly. Her description was accurate, was almost eloquent" (<i>M</i>, 30). Considering Norris's preference for believability over mere facts, it isn't surprising that the existence of the dishes matters less to the narrator than the verisimilitude of Maria's description. "Accuracy" here arises purely as a byproduct of the visual and other sensory detail (the ringing sound it made when struck, its softness when bitten) that Maria supplies. </p>

<p>Even as Norris praises Maria's capably naturalist descriptions, however, he uses her to illustrate the difference between his imaginary cinema and that pesky Other that savages the novelist's art—the actual film technology of the mid-1890s.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  By repeating the story nearly verbatim multiple times, Maria comes to resemble historical projection technology more than she does Norris's kinetoscopic prototype for the novelist of the future. During the first half-decade of cinema, moving pictures were usually "looped," or shown between three and six times apiece in succession (<i>EC</i>, 117). In addition, the brevity of each film and the slow production of new films ensured that even the casual cinemagoer could see the same film on multiple nights in multiple theaters. Maria does not even tell a story so much as describes exactly what several looped films of the dishes could have shown if taken from several optical points of view, and repeats it for an audience as avid for its iteration as the first film audiences were for repeat viewings of such instantly popular films as <i>The May Irwin Kiss</i> (Edison, 1896), a brief closeup of a notorious Broadway stage kiss, or <i>Rough Sea at Dover</i> (Robert Paul, 1895), a simple long shot of waves crashing on a beach.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Like the camera operators for these first "hit" films, Maria is a mosaicist who only collects images without a thought of arranging them into an aesthetic whole. Despite her artlessness, however, her "crowd" of one sits rapt, clamoring for more, before the force her images carry when, like those early films, they appear in a wholly new and strange context (here the tenement neighborhood of Polk Street). 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>If Maria does not live up to Norris's dream of verbal descriptions that tell as well as show, Norris partly succeeds in fixing the blame on her gendered and racialized body, thereby reducing her "art" to instinct and banishing it to the same nether realm of mimicry for mimicry's sake in which he locks up the historical cinema.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Yet the implicit contrast of Maria's habit of description to Norris's narrative craft cannot protect Norris's idealized cinematographer-storyteller from the implications of Maria's fate. Barbara Hochman argues that Maria, like all of <i>McTeague'</i>s Polk Street characters, "evoke[s] fear of desolation only to neutralize it." The two stories she repeats, about the dishes and her pet flying squirrel, "at once refer to loss and serve to stabilize its effects. Any feelings that Maria's losses might have stirred are presumably neutralized by the stabilizing mechanism" of the tales' reiteration.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  As Hochman describes them, these repetitions perform for Maria the duties of Freud's stimulus shield, the psychic protection against future neurological shocks that the subject accrues by cultivating lesser, more manageable shocks. Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer famously suggested that the early cinema's jumps in space and time afforded the masses a similarly homeopathic salve for the threatening shocks of traffic, crowds, factory machinery, and technological change in general.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup> </p>

<p>If we apply it to <i>McTeague</i>'s narrator rather than to Maria, however, Hochman's analysis suggests that Norris's obsessive focus on the dishes "story" both implies the superiority of Norris's own balancing act between showing and telling and also admits that Norris's quasi-kinetoscopic naturalism may already have fractured the boundary between high and low culture beyond repair. By praising the "accuracy" of Maria's word-images, <i>McTeague'</i>s narrator recalls Norris's distrust of factual accuracy as an overrated value of literary realism opposed to the red-blooded truths of "real" culture in general and naturalism in particular.  </p>

<p>But Norris treads a fine line between deriding mass culture and simply describing it, and if the reader cannot tell the difference between the two, it matters little what the author intended. The narrator's verdict of "accurate" reveals the Maria-Zerkow plot as less a proof of urban atavism and more an unconscious, nightmare vision of the American market for fiction in the new century. To compete in an economy where commodities must produce, predict, and mirror consumers' desires, the novelists of this fearsome future, represented here by Maria (playing the part of stand-in for the regionalist women novelists who, for Norris, represented the hack-wave of the future), would have to remove <i>every</i> trace of their presence from their books. For Zerkow, Maria is not an author but a medium that churns out on demand an image he cannot live without. "He saw someone who was near this gold," the narrator writes, and by proxy, "[h]e seemed near it; it was there, somewhere close by, under his eyes, under his fingers" (<i>M</i>, 36). Like the masses at the turn of the century, Zerkow takes pleasure in what Benjamin describes as "get[ting] hold of an object at very close range by way of an image, or rather its copy," and is willing to go to any lengths, even murder, to obtain that image.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  As Walter Benn Michaels puts it, "The distinction between [Zerkow's] desire for the gold and his desire for the description gets lost."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  In other words, Zerkow has not lost his ability to distinguish between the gold service and the 

<b></b>

 description. He has lost his ability to know which one he desires the most, the object or its representation. The word-pictures that Maria offers and retracts in this naturalist game of <i>fort-da</i> hold value for their consumer <i>as images, </i>not as guarantors of reality, let alone some unified, tacitly pedagogical, naturalist reconstruction of it. When Maria stops repeating her descriptions, the exasperated Zerkow kills her and begins to look for the "real" gold service, but his desire obsessively returns to representation and reproduction. When Zerkow himself dies of undisclosed causes, he leaves behind a hovel littered with rusty pots and pans, totems for the weightless word-image that became his heart's desire. </p>

<p>This bitter satire of the relationship between an overly impersonal narrator and an overly authoritarian reader predicts disaster for Norris's ideal novel. In dubbing himself both a mosaicist and a creator, Norris himself constructs the criteria by which to judge his first great commercial success a naturalist failure, for he cannot resist distancing his own narration style from Maria's droning descriptions. As critics from Donald Pizer to Bell have noted, Norris alternates striking descriptions with grotesque asides about Man and Woman, Force and Evil, Nature and Fate: "Below the fine fabric of all that was good in him ran the foul stream of hereditary evil, like a sewer . . . . The evil of an entire race flowed in his veins. Why should it be?" (<i>M</i>, 22). At such moments, the novelist's traditional <i>droit de seigneur</i> over readerly interpretation asserts itself with a vengeance. These asides also assert a second, similarly uneasy function of <i>McTeague</i>'s calling a projector by an arcade machine's name: they express the importance to Norris of intimate address for distinguishing the novel from mass(-addressed) culture. Whatever kind of kinetoscopic-literary hybrid Norris wants the naturalist novel to be, it must nevertheless retain the whispering distance from the individual that belongs to the novelist who offers the fiction, though only the fiction, of holding open a curtain of language for the individual reader alone. </p>

<p>As I've suggested, however, <i>McTeague</i> closes this curtain in spite of itself, in part thanks to Norris's own flirtation with mechanical literary reproduction. The gold plate story is only the primary <i>represented</i> example of a repeated description. <i>McTeague</i>'s omniscient narrator repeats itself more obsessively than either Zerkow or Maria when describing the scent of Mac's "dental parlors" ("a mingled odor of bedding, creosote, and ether," three iterations), Marcus's parroted political epithets (three iterations), Mac and Trina's wedding photograph (three iterations), and the descriptions of Trina's "tiara of swarthy hair," her "adorable little chin," and her "lips and the lobes of her tiny ears, pale . . . [and] suggestive of anemia" (four full iterations). Overstated, exhibitionist, and blunt, these repetitions snare the reader's movement through the causal chain of events by inviting recognition that one has seen exactly this stylized word-image before. In fact, both Norris and his editors recognized the repetitions as a distraction. Norris excised some of them himself before publication, and one page of his handwritten manuscript of <i>McTeague</i> bears the annotation "repetition 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> time" in a hand not Norris's own, in reference to the phrase "the intuitive feminine fear of the male."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Concerned to get "down into . . . life" without mitigating grotesque realities of sex and crime or turning away from quotidian experience of theaters, fairs, and city 

<b></b>

 streets, Norris obligates <i>McTeague</i> to incorporate cinematographic experience—not a metaphorical replication of cinematographic production alone, but the experience of watching films, including its compulsion to repeat—into naturalist craft.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup> </p>

<p>Once committed to this, however, Norris leaves himself little imaginative space for narrational authority. <i>McTeague'</i>s techno-writerly narrator effectively becomes like Maria Macapa: a substitute not for the cinematic <i>camera</i> but for the <i>projectionist</i> of early cinema who, like Edwin S. Porter before he became the Edison company's top filmmaker, arranged unrelated films into thematically-unified programs (<i>EC</i>, 259)<i>.</i> Like the projectionist attacked by a naïve spectator in Porter's <i>Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show</i> (Edison, 1902), the distant, masterly hand envisioned by Norris transforms in <i>McTeague</i> into a technician who stages preexisting pictures for an audience separated from him not by a great divide of time, space, or privilege, but by a screen as flimsy as a bed sheet.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  By foregrounding the "naturalist machine"—or better, the mechanism of naturalism—the naturalist who operates the "kinetoscope" that is <i>McTeague</i> simultaneously proclaims his presence and endangers his singularity as an agent. </p>

<p>If we revisit the Orpheum scene from the standpoint of <i>McTeague</i>'s kinetoscopic imaginary, the bad object the novel tries to contain seems to be not the medium of film, but rather the mass audience and the transformation of cultural reception that screened cinema represents. The spectacles on stage interest the narrator far less than the spectacles of spectatorship, from the general bustle and heat of the crowd to the incidental remarks made by the party ("at every moment they made comments to one another, their eyes never leaving the stage," [<i>M</i>, 76]) to little Owgooste's pants-wetting episode, that foreshadow Zerkow's final, murderous feat of active reception. Indeed, Owgooste's accident is no more scatological than its neighbors as far as the narrator is concerned. The narrator levels mock-heroic commentary at this "catastrophe" ("his fortitude collapsed. What a misery!") just as forcefully as he fires it at the spectators in general ("Think of that! Art could go no farther"). The rhetorical parallel links the disaster of wetting one's pants in public to the primal scene of mistaking private activities for public ones, and constructs lowbrow, collective cultural responses as helpless acts of incontinence; these spectators can keep neither their private thoughts nor their bodies to themselves. This mockery punishes them for their imagined naïveté and impropriety while it congratulates the reader for having more shame, and indeed for having the good taste to stay at home and discover the prurient pleasures of vaudeville via naturalist fiction instead. </p>

<p>Norris the artist may have rejected and even scatalogized mass entertainments (even while Norris the slummer enjoyed them thoroughly), but his horror at the public exposure given the conventionally private body negatively expresses the political charge of vaudeville and cinema exhibition. Early cinema appealed directly to workers and immigrants, and offered cheap entertainment in spaces like the Orpheum, which allowed and even invited polyglot social exchange rather than the respectful silence of legitimate theater spectatorship. Cinema granted viewers not merely the illusion of reality, but also a distracted and distanced position from which to consider the machines and mechanisms behind realist representation. This position also granted 

<b></b>

 spectators choices that the traditional arts preferred to obscure: what to look at, how to interpret, and what to ignore<i>.</i> The Lumières' <i>actualités</i>, for example, framed their busy subjects from sufficiently long distances that each viewer could come away from the same film with unique impressions. Though I have found no direct evidence that Norris saw <i>New York, Broadway et Union Square</i>, it is characteristic in that the camera remains still while points of potential interest enter and leave the screen from every part of the frame and throughout the depth of field.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  The Lumières' horse, which stops near center-frame by chance and gets obscured continually by other moving bodies much closer to the camera, would probably have attracted Mac's attention only if he happened to be looking at the spot where it stops, or perhaps because he liked horses, not because the filmmaker intended the horse to star in the film.  </p>

<p>Owgooste's disaster indicates, among other things, that a spectatorial position imbued with such interpretive authority over the text rejects the disembodied absorption of readerly consumption, and demands that the spectator-reader be acknowledged as both fully embodied and intensely public—attentive, reactive, expressive—whether others appreciate one spectator's commentary or not. Tom Gunning has remarked about Mrs. Sieppe's reaction to the kinetoscope as a <i>trick</i> that she seems less naïve than experienced in technological display culture; after all, she does not believe she sees real people or real horses flickering before her eyes.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  She identifies these images not as unmediated reality, but as a staged and manipulated representation, a transformation of the real that is recognizable as such precisely because it is so impossibly accurate. If Gunning is right about this, then in representing an audience's response to projected films, Norris portrays a reality that <i>McTeague</i> does not recognize: that the crowd gathered before this low-culture machine is neither so gullible nor so homogeneous as its critics imagined.  </p>

<p>This primal scene of aesthetic (mass-)consumption suggests that the crowning anxiety of the naturalist author is that the crowd knows at every moment that a machine lies behind the curtain, and that this awareness prompts the crowd to speculate about what culture could produce for them beyond its traditional offerings. The crowd, following the lead of the stubborn Mrs. Sieppe, might for example use cultural texts as excuses for interacting with each other, and for challenging the value of what they have seen. The only happy ending Norris grants to any plotline in <i>McTeague</i> hinges on a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of such cultural appropriation. In another subplot, two comical shy types that Norris borrows from local color fiction, Old Grannis and Miss Baker, realize that their tenement rooms have identical wallpaper and were probably once sections of the same room. Even before this revelation, Maria makes them aware of how they mirror each other within their private spaces despite their scarcely having met (see <i>M</i>, 25). This subplot is instructive for its echo of what <i>McTeague</i>'s kinetoscope show wants to say, apart from Norris's intentions for it, about culture after mechanical reproduction: that the materialism of industrial culture, film included, radically undermines the traditional role of aesthetic <i>content</i> in forging shared experience among the recipients of culture. In a U.S. in which wallpaper imprinted with "hundreds and hundreds of tiny Japanese mandarins . . . helping hundreds of almond-eyed ladies into hundreds of 

<b></b>

 impossible junks" (<i>M</i>, 91) and engravings of the court of Lorenzo de' Medici acquire value by containing "a great many res . . . for the money" (<i>M</i>, 6), Old Grannis and Miss Baker's mutual realization that they have some experience in common—even the banal experience of mass-produced décor—is catalyst enough to turn their clandestine longing into an intimate bond. Not even the narrator's merciless parody of sentimental style can vitiate the readerly power that brings about their union, a power he recognizes when he remarks that "[t]hey stood at length in a little Elysium <i>of their own creating</i>" (<i>M</i>, 181, emphasis added).  </p>

<p>Norris may have meant the Grannis-Baker plot to satirize the sentimentality of popular local-color fiction, but the satire turns on Norris, mocking him with a vision of intimacy that novelists, it seems, can never again forge with their readers.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  The final coup that clinches the elderly lovers' relationship comes when Old Grannis sells the patent on his machine for binding volumes of <i>The Nation</i> that he never reads—ironically, the same <i>Nation</i> published by E. L. Godkin, who coined the term "chromo-civilization" to chastise those who valued quantities of mass-produced decorations over their quality—and suddenly has no excuse to "keep company" with Miss Baker through the wall at ritualized times; she must propose to do so in person, by taking him some tea.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The power of mass production and consumption to foster meanings in new ways resonates in the narrator's representation of even this entirely traditional social overture: "'I was making some tea, and I thought you would like to have a cup of tea.' Her agitation betrayed itself in the repetition of the word" (<i>M</i>, 179). Cultural <i>material</i>—complex plots, challenging paintings, aesthetic content of any kind with meanings authorized by a producer—plays no part in their union, while the realization about the wallpaper only buttresses <i>McTeague</i>'s uneasy certainty that mass production, however artlessly repetitive, inevitably generates publics as well as well as saleable images and texts. </p>

<p>In <i>McTeague</i>, Norris tests the fantastical novel-kinetoscope that he hoped would express the realities not merely of "life" as an abstract or universal constant, but of modern life. Just as important to Norris, unnerved as his narrator-proxy in <i>McTeague</i> is by the massification of both cultural production and textual interpretation, this twentieth-century novel would replicate these realities in the intimate setting of novel-reading, like the original kinetoscope that offered its wares to only one viewer at a time. Yet faced with the task of representing the <i>actual</i> cinema—that is, the medium of film and its underdeveloped institutional format as reflected by Norris's Orpheum scene—Norris makes judgments of both technology and spectators that echo back noisily upon the novel both as a form and as an institution with long-standing conventions of inscription and consumption, conventions that seemed increasingly tenuous by 1899. These echoes reverberate in <i>McTeague</i> with the force of a modern reality that Norris reconstructs without fully recognizing it: the reality of mass reception and its structural politicization of urban entertainment. Like the 1896 Lumière film <i>Photographe</i>, about a portrait photographer and his subject, <i>McTeague</i> implies that an elder medium such as still photography—or the novel—must expand its capabilities to match the realities that the new medium had made oddly fascinating through its acts of mediation. The unpredictable movements of the rowdy subject who finally knocks

Musser tracks the nationalist discourse of American cinematic superiority and the French threat to its primacy, represented by the <i>cinématographe</i>'s late but impressive arrival in the U.S., that ribboned through entertainment journalism in 1896–97: "The assertion of Lumière priority [as the true inventor of cinema] . . . was inevitably seen as a direct challenge to Edison and his apparently proper role as father of the latest fad.

<p><a name="FOOT44" href="#REF44">44</a>. Maria's repetitions mimic other technologies of mass production that caused consternation among the cultural elite: the presses that cranked out chromolithographs, wallpaper patterns, and other cheap cultural commodities. Don Graham provides a useful discussion of how Norris's description of the "Grandpa and Grandma" chromos (<i>M</i>, 91; Graham calls these "fine example[s] of department store art"), wallpaper, and interior decoration of Mac and Trina's flat "suggests the bad taste that characterizes everything about the place" and "express[es] perfectly the infantile, sentimental cast of Trina's mind" (Graham, <i>The Fiction of Frank Norris</i>, 57); Maria's descriptions also seem to perform an affirmative function, similar to that performed by the chromos, of recognizing and (temporarily) appeasing her desire for material wealth. Early in the novel, Norris spends entire paragraphs poking fun at newlyweds Trina and Mac's collection of such "facts," the cheaply manufactured kitsch they cram "prolific[ally]" on to their walls: "Most of them were framed colored prints from Christmas editions of the London 'Graphic' and 'Illustrated News,' the subject of each picture inevitably involving very alert fox terriers and very pretty moon-faced little girls" (<i>M</i>, 91). It seems, then, that the moving-picture show at the Orpheum provides only one example among many in <i>McTeague</i> of the "chromo-civilization" predicted by <i>The Nation</i>'s E. L. Godkin in 1874, a debauched universe of American "culture" replete with reproductions of paintings and a "large body of slenderly equipped" (i.e. under-educated) cultural pretenders like the McTeagues to buy them. "To be real," Godkin cautions his readers, "culture ought to affect a man's whole character, and not merely store his memory with facts." E. L. Godkin, "Chromo-Civilization," <i>The Nation</i> 482 (24 September, 1874), 202. See Trachtenberg's discussion of this essay in <i>The Incorporation of America</i>, 157. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT46" href="#REF46">46</a>. Maria's monotonous storytelling style allows Norris to distance himself both from slavish fidelity to detail and from what he considered the market-ready sentimentality of regionalist women writers. Norris's 1901 essay "Why Women Should Write the Best Novels—and Why They Don't" characterizes women as blessed with "impressionable, emotional and communicative" natures. In an 1897 article Norris reports that according to police detectives, a little girl is better at "identification and observation" than a photograph: "She is more sensitive to impression than an older person—a veritable sensitized plate, as one might say." Yet the development of women as fiction writers is limited by social constraints (she cannot move freely enough through the world to "live life" fully) and biological difference ("A man may grind on steadily for an almost indefinite period, when a woman at the same task would begin . . . to chafe, to fret . . . to polish too highly . . . . Then come fatigue, harassing doubts, more nerves . . . and a final abandonment of the enterprise"). Like the little girl with a keen eye for details but innocent of the skills to structure them, Maria mass-produces images so highly "polished" that they trap her in a vivid past, or worse, a hysterical fantasy. See Frank Norris, "Why Women Should Write the Best Novels: And Why They Don't" , in <i>LCFN</i>, 35, 35, and 36. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT47" href="#REF47">47</a>. Barbara Hochman, <i>The Art of Frank Norris, Storyteller</i> (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1988), 64. Maria's description "habit" places her in a role that Jennifer Fleissner identifies as common among women characters in American naturalism, that of the woman who desires to produce 

<b></b>

 something other than children or domestic space but, finding no outlet for that desire, turns obsessive-compulsive. Fleissner characterizes Trina's hoarding as related to narrative as well: "Like the gold piece, the virginal body can also be said to possess a 'purity' that allows it to stand for . . . the moment when the woman's defiled body is 'refilled' in order to produce the desired offspring. Yet . . . this movement from purity to fulfillment is thus a movement away from the valued object itself to the narrative it more properly represents . . . . She remains stuck at the initial moment of seeking value in the object itself—the gold, her body—rather than moving forward into the story that object is meant to imply." Jennifer L. Fleissner, <i>Women, Compulsion, Modernity: The Moment of American Naturalism </i>(Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2004), 215. As I will discuss, Zerkow becomes a destructive audience for the gold plate "view" due to a similar fixation on the representation rather than its purported object. </p>

<p>Recent scholarship on modernism and dance has celebrated the re of the female dancer as not only a symbol, but as an agent of aesthetic transformation in the twentieth century. The female dancer, it is argued, embodies the quest for freedom. She represents a revolt against the confinements of domesticity, she invents, she breaks taboos, she is mad, she is criminal, society will not tolerate her, she is subversive. "She" is Lucia Joyce, Jane Avril, Loie Fuller, Maud Allan, Mata Hari, Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis, Mary Wigman, Zelda Fitzgerald.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Her context is the 

<b></b>

 heyday and decline of the music hall; the sensational impact of Diaghilev's Russian Ballet; ragtime, jazz, ballroom dance, and jazz dance; the rise of cabarets and nightclubs; dance crazes and dance "manias"; and, going farther afield, the mechanization of everyday life (embodied, say, in tap dance's mechanical rhythms or Busby Berkeley's musicals) or, the opposite, the graceful, therapeutic movements of swooping airplanes, roller coasters, zippers, and cursive writing, which, along with Duncan's startling fluidity and tragically flowing scarf, all make up what Hillel Schwartz, in a masterful essay, has called "the new kinaesthetic of the twentieth century."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> </p>

<p>So compelling are the female dancers, so charismatic in capturing the imagination, that they have obscured another kind of dancing that, I shall argue, actually dominated the literary imagination in interwar Britain, and for good reason. I refer to social dancing, which was viewed as both mundane and dangerous; indeed, which brought to the fore the very potency of an everyday activity both banal and extraordinary. As experienced at parties, dance halls, night clubs, college clubs, and on the street, social dancing was both a symptom of modern alienation and its potential cure, an evanescent yet visceral form of collectivity that offered a vision of community as well as a sign of its elusiveness. Social dance (participatory and coercive, ritualistic and boring, lively and mechanical) embodied a problem of modernity—the quest for community and the desire for (re)enchantment—while at the same time putting on spectacular display the fragmentation and isolation that characterized the feeling of being modern.  </p>

<p>The hold of social dance on the literary imagination has been overlooked in modernist scholarship; in this article, I reassert the position of dance in interwar literature and culture. Hidden in plain sight, in modernist literary scenes, biographies and memoirs, psychoanalytic commentaries, educational manifestos, and ethnographies, social dance is everywhere in the documents of interwar Britain, serving as both fact and re of modernity—of that famous feeling that "all that is solid melts into air."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  What better spectacle and symbol of ephemerality than the always changing, always temporary arrangement of bodies into now this, now that conration, always ending with their dispersal? "Unity—dispersity" is the refrain of Woolf's <i>Between the Acts</i>: a neat summary of social dance itself, its rhythm of individuals pulled together, then apart.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>   </p>

<p>This essay, then, will survey how dance has come to be red as female emancipation in key works of recent scholarship, and move on to complicate this representation by turning to perceptions of dance by interwar British intellectuals, who were particularly attentive to social dancing and its meanings because of their preoccupation with social coherence and collectivism in an era of national and imperial unease. First ranging widely among Bloomsbury intellectuals to glean a general perception of dancing by Britain's most prominent and canonical writers, I then consider one group—Mass-Observation—in order to show that Bloomsbury's concerns were shared by other Cambridge-educated intellectuals <i>and</i> by lower-middle-class observers, whose project of creating a British ethnography was deeply informed and influenced by artistic and literary sensibilities. Finally, a close reading of dance scenes throughout works by Woolf ends this investigation with a demonstration of the ubiquity and powerful resonance of social dancing in key works of the modernist literary imagination.

 bringing this broad range of materials together, I hope to show that social dancing was of widespread interest and concern to those who considered themselves observers, critics, and makers of culture. The story these materials tell complicates the account whereby avant-garde dance fueled modernist aesthetics in such a way as to connect formal innovation with social liberation. To refer to the second epigraph to this essay: D. W. Winnicott, early in his career, noted astutely that dancers seemed "trained to liveliness." While the epigraph evinces Winnicott's early skepticism of the diagnostic value of psychoanalytic labels ("exhibitionism," "anal control," etc.) this should not detract from his cogent observation that there is something suspicious, indeed manic, about the trained liveliness of dancers: the essay in which this observation appears, "The Manic Defense," attempts to invent a vocabulary for the pathological happiness of the interwar years. Let us share Winnicott's suspicions, and consider not only performed, but social, dance as a symptom of interwar Britain's "manic defense" against war anxiety and social change. </p>

Knowing the Dancer from the Dance 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>A suitable emblem of the emphasis on individual female dancers is Lucia Joyce.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Carol Loeb Shloss has moved Lucia from the margins to the center of Joyce's work, arguing that she was a "centrally important muse to Joyce . . . . [Their relationship] helped to change the course of modern literature."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Crucial to Shloss's roughly Foucauldian argument is the idea that Lucia, in dancing, managed to revolt not only against an unsatisfactory home life, but against all of Western culture, which is "built upon a system of exclusions" in which "the expressive, 'dancing' body is regulated, disciplined, normalized, and individualized in proportion to the fears it arouses about transgression."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Acknowledging that Dionysian dancing is inherently dangerous in an Apollonian world, Shloss suggests that Nietzsche's diagnosis of modern life as a struggle between the forces of order and disorder illuminates Lucia's role in her father's schema: Lucia embodied the freedom Joyce could only imagine. Once Lucia's dancing is connected with insanity (as it was for two other famous dancers, Jane Avril and Nijinsky), she becomes a victim of medicalized knowledge. Before charting the disciplining of Lucia's dancing, Shloss sees her dancing, under the influence of several leading dancers, as a window on to utopian possibilities for social redemption. The influence of Jean Borlin, for example, whose Ballet Suédois Lucia had watched in Paris since 1923 and with whom she studied, was to inculcate in Lucia the "obsession with primitive tribal ritual . . . [and] the construction of an elsewhere of culture, [and the search] for alternatives on which to base . . . hopes of social renewal" (<i>LJ</i>, 146). Mary Wigman, expressionist dancer and writer, and later fascist, also "convinced . . . young women they were creating a new religion" (<i>LJ</i>, 151). Lucia's first dance teacher was Margaret Morris, the granddaughter of William Morris, whose goal was to achieve a synthesis between aesthetic and physical culture; dance was a form of physical rehabilitation, a kind of occupational therapy for typists and other sedentary workers, and a form of education through the senses for children. Studying at Morris's summer school in 

<b></b>

 the south of France in 1926 provides, for Schloss, perhaps the most glorious utopian possibilities of Lucia's—and maybe modernism's—life. Here, in a beautiful natural landscape away from the culture of Paris, the body could flourish, the synthesis could be achieved. If modernist aesthetics involves an ongoing confrontation not only with the ordering, sanitizing, pathologizing, disciplining forces of the dominant culture, but also with the fragmentations and separations bemoaned as symptomatic side-effects of the conformity to that culture, then dancing by the sea offers an image of health and liberation summed up in Schloss's description of the female dancers at Morris's school as "post-Victorian hippies" (<i>LJ</i>, 132). </p>

<p>Like Shloss, Nancy Reynolds and Malcolm McCormick have connected dance to female emancipation. The historical conditions for the emergence of modern dance were the newfound support among American female reformers for the inclusion of aesthetically pleasing physical exercise in the education of young women along with progressive, anti-Victorian encouragement of women's intellectual development. Reynolds and McCormick rank Loie Fuller the most important originator of twentieth-century dance, an assessment that harmonizes with Frank Kermode's celebration of Fuller as proto-modernist in his 1961 essay "Poet and Dancer Before Diaghilev."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Fuller is one of four American female pioneers whose innovative dances were to inaugurate the new era of modern movement: besides Fuller, Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis, and Maud Allan created a new space between music hall and ballet for the performances of newly liberated women. From the other direction came the Russian Ballet, which arrived in the West in 1909. The history of dance in the twentieth century begins with a competition between the innovative American female soloists and the Russian company whose leader was suspected of being a "dandy and a social climber."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  While the portraits of the American women are linked to the transformation, already underway, of women's social roles and the context of feminist agitation, the Russian Ballet's arrival in Paris is greeted with "shock" and outrage; it creates fads like the wearing of harem outfits and adds brighter colors to the clothing and décor of Western Europe.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Whereas female reformers set the stage for the success of, for example, Loie Fuller, the Russian Ballet revolutionized society with its freshness and "unabashed eroticism": in short, the Russians successfully entered the marketplace for the primitive.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  According to Reynolds and McCormick, performed dance of the modernist era signified innovation and transgression.  </p>

<p>For Woolf and for Bloomsbury, the Russian Ballet was of more obvious significance than the American female soloists. Evelyn Haller, in an essay on Woolf and the Russian dancers, surveys the impact of the Russian Ballet on Woolf and the London intelligentsia. Like Schloss and McCormick and Reynolds, the story of dance, for Haller, is the story of emancipation: "[t]o respond to the Russian dancers was to emerge from ossified forms of Victorian and Edwardian artistic and cultural constraints into a new sensibility."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The meaning of the Russians' experimentation and extravagance lies, too, in its redemptive possibilities. For Haller, the most important feature of the Russian ballet is not its eroticism, but its liturgical elements—its scenes of processions, weddings, and sacrifices. Haller infers that the value of the Russian ballet to western audiences was its ability to reawaken an inauthentic secular age to religious ceremony. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Certainly, for some in the Bloomsbury milieu, the power of dance to re-enchant and exoticize the world would seem to be its principal attraction. For Jane Ellen Harrison, for example, the observation of dance was indeed a mesmerizing experience. Harrison wrote in her 1925 <i>Reminiscences of a Student's Life</i> that watching dancers moved her in a way that no work of literature, music, or painting could. Seeing dancers at a festival in Spain, Harrison wrote that "a procession seems to me like life, like <i>durée</i> itself, caught and fixed before me . . . . But it is strangely moving in the fading light with the wondrous setting of the high altar and the golden grille, and above all the sound of the harsh, plangent Spanish voices. Great Pan, indeed, is dead—his ghost still dances."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Dancers exert a powerful hold on Harrison the observer, allowing her to imagine that she is watching a still life; time stops, and the observer seems to experience the collapse of distance between present and past. Harrison's response to dancers (shared by Vita Sackville-West in her biography of her dancing Spanish grandmother, <i>Pepita</i>) is fairly characteristic of one strand of thought in modernist writing: dancers bring ancient, even primitive rituals to the forefront of our awareness, awakening progressive and alienated moderns in a technological society to an organic, ritualized, and communal existence that industrial capitalism has all but erased.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Not particularly mystified by the Russian ballet nor enamored of its individual performers was Lytton Strachey, who met Nijinsky at a party in 1913 and declared him "attractive" but "not . . . particularly interesting—as the poor fellow cannot speak more than 2 words of any human language it's difficult to get very far with him"; Strachey found watching <i>Le Sacre du Printemps</i> "one of the most painful experiences of my life . . . . I couldn't have imagined that boredom and sheer anguish could have been combined together at such a pitch."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Strachey's dismissal of Nijinksy as uninteresting because impossible to talk to is reminiscent of Woolf's profound distaste for Lydia Lopokova, the member of Diaghilev's ballet who had the most direct influence on Bloomsbury by marrying John Maynard Keynes.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  To many in Bloomsbury, including Clive Bell, Duncan Grant, Vanessa, and Woolf herself, Lopokova was anathema. Woolf wrote to Vanessa in 1923 that Keynes's marriage to Lydia would be "a fatal and irreparable mistake"; she called her a "parrokeet" and made fun of her accent; she derided the "limitations" of her talk about the Ballet, and remarked that "unfortunately she sometimes writes"; she wrote in great detail to Jacques Raverat of Lydia's improper disposal of used sanitary towels; to Raverat she described Lydia's conversational style as "one shriek, two dances; then silence, like a submissive child."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The initial aversion to Lydia as both foreigner and dancer exposes Bloomsbury biases, not least of which is the skepticism toward dance, and toward dancers as vulgar non-intellectuals whose contributions to conversation were not only negligible, but destructive.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> </p>

<p>While numerous comments on Lydia can be found throughout Woolf's diaries and letters, scant evidence exists about Woolf's exposure to other female dancers of the same generation. A single mention of Isadora Duncan, whose autobiography Virginia sent to Vanessa in 1928, throws into relief the absence of performers like Duncan, Fuller, and St. Denis in Bloomsbury's theater-going experiences.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Bloomsbury (perhaps with the exception of Keynes) did not turn to the female dancer for inspiration. Woolf did, 

<b></b>

 however, turn to the music hall for escape. She went to the Hippodrome in 1918, the war and raids still going, "to see life."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  She qualified her praise for the English humor performed there, which she called "the real thing," with a declaration about the "incredible, pathetic stupidity of the music hall." There is something in Woolf's attraction to "the real thing" of the middle-class celebration of authentic working-class culture (whose endangerment by commodity culture was lamented in T. S. Eliot's eulogy for music-hall performer Marie Lloyd in 1923).<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  On Marie Lloyd herself, Woolf recorded in her diary in 1921: "We went to the Bedford Music Hall [in Camden Town] last night, &amp; saw Miss Marie Lloyd, a mass of corruption . . . waddling, aged, unblushing . . . . I felt that the audience was much closer to drink &amp; beating &amp; prison than any of us."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Woolf's interest in authentic working-class culture only went so far.	 </p>

<p>Writing about modernism and dance has focused on performance, framing it either with the relationship between modernism and popular culture or with the symbiotic relations between different avant-garde art forms. However, we should not overlook the significance of casual, recreational dancing to Bloomsbury. From the letters she wrote as a young woman, we get a sense of Woolf's participation in, and hesitation about, dancing at parties. She danced her first May Ball at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1900 at the age of 18. Characteristically, she did not dance much. The next year, she went to "only" three dances in her "London season," and revealed that "we sit in corners and look like mutes"; the next year, she lamented that "I would give all my profound Greek to dance really well." That lament was short-lived. Virginia thought of herself as a non-dancer, which meant being an "unpopular" young woman and a social "failure." In 1906, she wrote to Violet Dickinson that "I went to a dance last night, and found a dim corner where I sat and read <i>In Memoriam</i>. While Nessa danced every dance till 2.30."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Woolf's diary underscores dancing as a social convention, a way of defining, not liberating, a young woman of a certain class. Woolf needed to navigate the social terrain that demanded that girls be dancers, and find a world in which it was more than acceptable to read Tennyson, sitting in a corner, rather than participate in the social whirl. Contrast Woolf's feelings of inadequacy with the relatively sprightly accounts of dancing for others in the Bloomsbury milieu. Lytton Strachey wrote about dancing two-steps "so much nicer than waltzes" dressed as a pirate at an all-night party; Strachey danced, it seems, without self-consciousness, and was described by Osbert Sitwell as possessing the "air of someone pleasantly awakening from a trance, jigging about with an amiable debility."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Perhaps Bloomsbury's premier recreational dancer, and the best at describing it, was Frances Partridge, eighteen years Woolf's junior. From the weekly dances at the progressive Bedales school, where "the girls whirled round with bodies and legs parallel to the ground, supported on the interlocked arms of their partners" to the wartime dances given by local ladies for officers, which Partridge attended zealously in search of a "good time," to the postwar Cambridge jazz dances of the Quinquaginta club, Partridge provides a glimpse of a world where dance signifies the breakdown of sexual boundaries for the generation after Woolf's.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  After the war, she writes in her memoir, "[a]ll England had gone dancing mad and so had Cambridge."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Dance was an outlet, a pent-up energy released in a frenzied vitality. 

<b></b>

 Liberation for women? Perhaps. Yet, like Woolf, she experienced pangs of confusion over what dancing meant. "[T]he dichotomy between dancing and intellectual interests produced a form of schizophrenia, one of the unpleasant symptoms of which was blind panic when members of different worlds happened to be present at the same time. I was like a jelly that had only partly set."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> </p>

<p>As much as, or even more than, innovative female soloists and the Russian ballet, new dances inspired by ragtime, jazz, and other forms of popular music influenced Bloomsbury's experience of sociability, generational differences, gender roles, health, intellectual pursuits, alienation, and mortality. Jazz and its dances belonged to the younger generation. The <i>Daily Mail</i> wrote for the first time of "this jazz age" in 1919, an age of "people dancing as they have never danced before, in happy rebound from the austerities of war."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  (Such postwar happy rebounds would become the occasion for Winnicott's elaboration, following Melanie Klein, of the "manic defense"<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> ). Jazz was introduced to Britain in 1912, consolidated with that year's revue "Hullo, Ragtime"; Irving Berlin visited Britain in 1913; the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919; and Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra in 1923. The most popular postwar dances were the foxtrot, one-step, shimmy, blues, and Charleston. New publications devoted to jazz sprouted up in the 1920s and 1930s, including <i>Melody Maker</i> , <i>Rhythm</i> , <i>Gramophone </i>, <i>Swing Music,</i> and <i>Hot News</i> . African, Guyanan, Jamaican and other Caribbean musicians, as well as African Americans, made blacks highly visible in a new range of performance venues. <i>This</i> is the general context for Virginia Woolf's alienation, Strachey's amiable debility, and Partridge's mix of a good time with schizophrenia.  </p>

"To the dogs, to the pubs, to the dance hall": Mass-Observation 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>One of the most revealing sources of information about social dancing are the notes taken by Mass-Observation observers in dance halls in the late 1930s, part of the project to create an ethnography of the British people through collection of information on everyday life. Tom Harrisson, one of Mass-Observation's principal founders, searched out materials with great gusto by going out, as one of his artist colleagues reminisced, "to the pubs, to the dogs, to the dance halls."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Along with poet Charles Madge and filmmaker Humphrey Jennings, Harrisson spearheaded an effort to document the everyday with every bit as much zeal as the surrealists—to whom Mass-Observation has frequently been compared, and who influenced Mass-Observation in both direct and indirect ways.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Propelled by a sense of national crisis (symbolized twofold by the abdication crisis and the spectacular burning-down of the Crystal Palace, which by that time had become a venue for dances), the Mass-Observation notes on dance halls, jazz, night clubs, and rhythm clubs provide a stunning opportunity to glean perceptions of dance as both potentially community-building national pastime and as symptom of late-1930s fragmentation, by a mix of middle-class, Cambridge-educated intellectuals, literary types—both H. D. and the Scottish novelist Naomi Mitchison served as observers—and lower-middle-class observers and diarists who found themselves empowered

<b></b>

  by the opportunity to be creative and critical writers. The Mass-Observation fieldwork significantly enhances an assessment of how dance captured "the literary imagination."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> </p>

<p>By the late 1930s, British intellectuals were well aware of the role dance and dance music might play in the context of rising anxieties about war. One role was reflective: a newspaper article collected by an observer noted that "perhaps this noisy exhibition of abandoned convulsions was all in keeping with a mad world in which madmen are ting to dominate the continent."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  At the same time, one of the most important functions of dance and dance music was to soothe. "The universal and subtle influence of jazz is that it plugs up and soothes the jangled nerve, the wishful thought."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Observers noted that radios and gramophones were increasingly used in workshops and small factories in London's East End to calm workers' raw nerves. "Dance music is the most popular type" and "The music has, of course, to be carefully selected—quick steps tend to speed up workers' rhythms to a damaging extent on intricate jobs, while slow waltzes may actually reduce the rate of work of repetitive processes."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The soothing effects of jazz music, however, are juxtaposed with observations of dance halls, where the dominant themes are hardly the well-being induced by modern social dancing: on the contrary, the resounding themes are racial difference, conspicuous sexualities, bodily harm, and a problematic mix of ages and generations. Among the "odd details" noted by observers was the children's space upstairs, decorated with Disney paintings.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Observers recorded the presence of mixed ages, including a ten-year-old girl accompanying her parents. Tension is noted between old-timers who have been coming to the same dance hall for almost forty years, and new, younger dancers described by the older generation as having "no sociability, no etiquette."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The new generation looks unhealthy. The typical expression on the faces of dancers is boredom.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Dancing causes injuries: participants complain about becoming ill and disabled from dancing (one asphalter cannot work because of his injuries); an observer notes a petition to ban the jitterbug because of people getting kicked. Observations of boredom and illness combine with "surprise" at the "amount of open intimacy" and "excessive fondling."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  The threat of sexuality registers in the presence of a "pansy type" who "gazes in admiration" at a "negress" who sings. At the Paramount dance hall in Tottenham Court Road, the "crowd is mostly working class—coarse type in many cases. Percentage of Jews about 40." A "Negro aged about 25," a native of Freetown, remarks that the color bar is higher in London than in Paris. "When he goes and asks a girl to dance he expects to be refused and takes it as a matter of course."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  At another dance hall in Tottenham Court Road, the observer notes "crowd . . . with high Jewish percentage" and a youth with a "badge on which was the Jewish symbol." "Seems to be a centre for Jews," he remarks to an interlocutor.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Dance halls displayed a spectacle of difference: race, class, sexuality, and youth all presented dance as a challenge and a problem, not a spectacle of emancipation and progress, but the tensions of a society in transition, a society in conflict, and bodies less liberated than convulsive and banal.  </p>

<p>The observations at dance halls share features of those at nightclubs and rhythm clubs, where dancing took place and which were also locations of considerable heterogeneity. 

<b></b>

 The notes on nightclubs evince a preoccupation with race. For example: quoting a French, female interviewee, "'there was only me and a few women—prostitutes. In came these great big men, black as coal . . . . These people dance the whole night . . . some of the coloured girls, they're beautiful.'" Another interviewee comments, "'this place is run by Jews.'" And another says, "'Dance music has originated from the coloured people, the niggers. All their music is rhythm.'"<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  At a rhythm club, where people gathered for jazz appreciation, an interviewee commented "'if [observer] wants to go into the racial side of jazz it may interest him to know that most of the big time players are Jews. "They are always where the money is."'" At the back of the club, "A Jew and [some] Chinese entered into an earnest discussion on jazz."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  These were places where races mixed: the interviews reveal that club-goers were highly conscious of this mixture, in some cases attracted by it, in others, uncomfortable. Places where social dancing occurred or where dance music was played were locations of everyday "cosmopolitan modernity."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  They displayed a hybridity hard to discern elsewhere (say, at Cambridge) but highly significant as a challenge to English xenophobia and a harbinger of a new, multicultural society. </p>

<p>The cosmopolitanism of the nightclubs and rhythm clubs throws into relief something that interested Mass-Observation a great deal about the dance halls: they sometimes became places to reassert Englishness. For one interviewee, the rhythm club offered an interesting place to escape the boredom of the dance halls: "'there's the monotony—going round and round a floor, doing the same old steps again and again, until one day I asked myself, "what am I doing this for?"'"<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  The dance halls' monotony arose in confrontation with the multiculturalism of jazz, which for some in the music business was a problem, a threat to English identity as revealed and bolstered by native traditions in music and dance. The solution was to invent a tradition. </p>

<p>The solution arrived under the subheading of "Modernity—Combined with an Old-time Character." In 1938, dance hall impresario C. L. Heimann sought to invent and market a dance that would appeal to old and new alike, drawing on nostalgia to counter the hybridity and difference that dance had come to represent. A press bulletin stated:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The present vogue of returning to past epochs—as, for example, the popularity of things Victorian and Edwardian—is exemplified in this dance . . . . The musical basis . . . is an old-time melody—this and the Dance itself is severely ENGLISH. So many of the new and short-lived dances that have been introduced in recent years have been American, and based upon Negro rhythms that have not been suited to English temperament.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p class="continued">The new dance was called "The Chestnut Tree," and it was regarded as both English and democratic. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) Its arm movement—both arms upraised—was seen to provide a contrast with the one arm raised in salute to Hitler.

It was purely invented; it did not derive from any authentic working-class culture.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  "The Chestnut Tree" or "Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree" was a popular song in campfire and community singing in the interwar

years; it may allude to Longfellow's poem "The Village Blacksmith" or to a popular nursery rhyme. In <i>1984</i>, a dystopian version of the song is played on a telescreen in the Chestnut Tree Café. "The Chestnut Tree" was by no means the only dance that Mass-Observation followed (the "Lambeth Walk" received much attention, as well as others, to a lesser degree). But the remarkable attention to it in the Mass-Observation notes indicates that it seemed a particularly apt entry into a collective unconscious, one of Mass-Observation's goals. It was a nationally known symbol, popular and familiar from childhood, associated both with the high (royalty) and the low (Longfellow's village). The King had sung it; Victoria said that Longfellow was the only poet her servants knew; memorization of Longfellow's meter was embedded in the English education system.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  "The Chestnut Tree"'s flexibility as a symbol made it especially resonant as a potential icon of social coherence to counter the hybridity of jazz that threatened the dance halls. Mass-Observation assiduoulsy collected responses from volunteers about "<small class="caps">t</small>he Chestnut Tree"; it was the dance whose impact they most doggedly pursued (to discover, through interviews, that the majority of dance hall attendees found it fairly silly).<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  As fragile symbol of social coherence perhaps "<small class="caps">t</small>he Chestnut Tree" dance embodied a desire for synthesis, somewhere in the future, that Yeats had expressed in 1927 in "Among School Children": "O chestnut tree, great rooted blossomer . . .

 O body swayed to music, O brightening glance / How can we know the dancer from the dance?"<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The Mass-Observation notes reveal that social dance took place in arenas where multicultural influences competed with nativist proclivities; English identity was at stake. The power of social dance as a symbol of collective identity deployed in literature remains to be explored, which I now do in the work of Virginia Woolf. </p>

Dancing with Woolf 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Dance scenes and dance metaphors are rich presences throughout Woolf's fiction. Three of her major novels—<i>The Voyage Out</i> , <i>The Years</i> , and <i>Between the Acts</i> —display dance scenes quite conspicuously to explore themes crucial to Woolf such as community and isolation, the limitations of language, the power of music, the socialization of women, tradition and modernization. In <i>Jacob's Room</i> , <i>To the Lighthouse</i> , and <i>The Waves</i> , dance res either literally or ratively, as it does—in what is perhaps Woolf's most masterful and poignant use of dance—in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> . Indeed, dance is central to Woolf's literary enterprise. Understanding Woolf's carefully choreographed deployment of dance illuminates crucial aesthetic and social meanings of her work, and in particular reveals that while social dance often offered feelings of collectivity and communal values, those feelings were ephemeral, and precariousness signifies most powerfully in Woolf's use of dance in her narratives. </p>

<p>Woolf's first novel, <i>The Voyage Out</i>, contains a complex dance scene that rewrites <i>Emma</i>'s, putting a distinctly modernist spin on its precursor; it sets the stage for further consideration of Woolf's interwar fiction.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  In chapter 12, Rachel Vinrace, Woolf's shy, reclusive heroine, seems to triumph over seclusion and alienation through not only the pleasure of social dancing, but the pleasure of enthralling an audience—indeed, inspiring it to dance—with the skill and artistry of her piano playing. Toward the end of the chapter, which is devoted in its entirety to the dance party, Rachel exclaims "I've changed my view of life completely!" after having confessed to one of her companions that "she'd no idea that dances could be so delightful."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Rachel's apparent transformation from withdrawn adolescent to delighted young woman culminates in her role as musician at the dance's end. In a rousing finale, she takes over when the South American musicians stop playing, and leads her audience to depart with her from convention while she plays a Mozart sonata and, in answer to the objection that she is not playing dance music, urges the party to "'Invent the steps.' Sure of her melody she marked the rhythm boldly so as to simplify the way . . . . 'This is the dance for people who don't know how to dance!' she cried" (<i>VO</i>, 166). Under the newly bold, impassioned Rachel's leadership, the English tourists suddenly become more spontaneous, creative, and even fantastic.  </p>

<p class="continued">At this point, Woolf seems to use dancing to underscore the transformative power of Rachel's music, as well as the emergence of her art from a private to a public realm. The dancing seems to liberate the young men in the room; in Hewet's case, it leads him into a predictable imperial fantasy in which he is feminized, the masculine subject of empire allowed a temporary holiday in which he inhabits the place of the other. Hewet's transformation through dance into an Indian maiden alerts readers to the inseparability of the dance scene, and all its attendant unconscious wishes, from the novel's general geopolitical psychodynamics: the novel is, after all, about, and skeptical of, the English touristic desire for exotic locations. </p>

<p>Therefore it is apt that the dance's finale underscores the Englishness of the tourists, solidifying their collective identity but closing off the possibilities of invention and exoticism that temporarily opened up under the rubric of Rachel's idiosyncratic choice of a Mozart sonata as dance music. "'Now for the great round dance!' Hewet shouted. Instantly a gigantic circle was formed, the dancers holding hands and shouting out, 'D'you ken John Peel,' as they swung faster and faster and faster, until the strain was too great, and one link of the chain—Mrs. Thornbury—gave way, and the rest went flying across the room in all directions" (<i>VO</i>, 166–67). The dance shifts, in its climax, to a celebratory, and ultimately chaotic, embrace of Englishness, departing from waltzes, barcarolles, and the Mozart sonata to a definitively English song. The round dance is an unambiguous symbol of English parochialism. At the beginning of chapter 12, the snobbish Pepper "began a discourse upon round dances, morris dances, and quadrilles, all of which are entirely superior to the bastard waltz and spurious polka which have ousted them most unjustly in contemporary popularity—when the waiters gently pushed him on to his table in the corner" (<i>VO</i>, 151). The aftermath of the great round dance casts the English tourists in an unflattering light, suggesting of course what one might expect: Woolf's nascent skepticism towards empire and distaste for xenophobia mired in the contradictions inherent in her own position of social privilege and touristic experiences.  </p>

The complexions of the elder ladies suffered terribly, and, as if conscious that a cold eye had been turned upon them, they began to say good-night and to make their way up to bed.</p>

<p class="continued">Thus the dance serves as a source of temporary coherence, ultimately framed as "unbecoming" and the cause of dishevelment and exhaustion. The chapter ends with individuals emphatically separate from each other, distinctly uncommunicative ("They did not wish to share their impressions" [<i>VO</i>, 169]) after all the dancing has stopped 

<b></b>

 and a sense of space has been created by Rachel playing Bach. English dancing conveys a fragile collective feeling that quickly dissolves, leaving the reader with impressions of commotion and disturbance rather than the defiance of convention and flirtation with otherness that ensued from the invention of dancing to Mozart. Individuals then retreat into their separate spaces and silences. The dance chapter impresses on the reader that the power of dance to bring people together is evanescent. </p>

<p>Woolf indicates in her first novel that she takes interest in the way dance can elaborate tension, danger, fragmentation, and even violence. In the chapter, the language associated with dance is threatening and haunted. Woolf chooses language that conveys friction, even calamity: "the trio dashed spontaneously into the triumphant swing of the waltz"; "the circles smashed into little separate bits"; "the eddies whirled, the couples circled round in them, until there was a crash, and the circles were broken up into separate bits" (<i>VO</i>, 152); "all this, the strife of men and women" (<i>VO</i>, 155); "the music to which they had danced so gaily was one of passionate regret for dead love . . . dreadful sorrows had always separated the dancers from their past happiness" (<i>VO</i>, 165). Words like "dashed," "smashed," "crash," "tramping," "strife," "dishevelled," and "chaffing" all unequivocally connote disorder, stress, anxiety. The dance scene is also a stage for a violent argument between Rachel and St. John Hirst, during which he communicates his misogyny and she emerges with the cry that "'He's made me furious!'" (<i>VO</i>, 155).  </p>

<p>Whether the coming-together of the English tourists, inspired by Rachel's playing, resolves any of this friction is dubious. To be sure, a certain calm is restored and much violent energy released and dissipated. However, a clear triumph of Rachel's emergence into public life, progress in the communication between individuals, and enjoyment of shared meaning, remain elusive. When asked to confirm that her view of life has changed, Rachel yawns. "'I don't remember . . . . I feel like a fish at the bottom of the sea'." Hirst is thinking hard, but all he can communicate is "'I have a key,'" "cryptically." And Hewet declares "'I don't find it simple at all'" (<i>VO</i>, 169). The chapter ends on a note of uncertainty and mystery, not revelation. That Rachel should feel like a "fish at the bottom of the sea" is sinister, suggesting that the dance, with its dangerous eddies, has submerged her, foreshadowing her death at the end of the novel.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup> </p>

<p>Throughout her career, Woolf continued to use dance scenes to stage struggles over individual and group identities; in particular, she returned much later, in <i>The Years</i> and <i>Between the Acts</i>, to the dance as a scene of attempted yet unsuccessful solidification of English identity and coherence. In <i>The Years</i>, the dance occurs in the final, "Present Day" section, the section that follows the war and in which the Pargiters attempt to restore their connections to each other. The most successful dancers are Sara Pargiter and Nicholas, the text's most eccentric res; they find harmony amidst the fragmentation that persistently troubles the family (a microcosm of the nation in this multigeneration saga). Significantly, and like a rehearsal for <i>Between the Acts</i>, the dance music is replaced by a curious song sung by children at the very end of the novel, a song "so shrill, so discordant, and so meaningless" that some in the family nevertheless find "beautiful."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  The children's "noise" foreshadows the cacophonous jazz music in Woolf's final novel. In <i>Between the Acts</i>, dance first res as part of the 

<b></b>

 pageant play, a genre Woolf employed to emphasize communal values.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The dance of the villagers serves briefly to unify the English across classes, providing a glimpse of a shared community: "The gramophone blared. Dukes, priests, shepherds, pilgrims and serving men took hands and danced . . . . It was a mellay; a medley; an entrancing spectacle (to William) of dappled light and shade on half clothed, fantastically coloured, leaping, jerking, swinging legs and arms. He clapped till his palms stung" (<i>BTA</i>, 93). Here the village dancers are at their most inspiring, almost magical in their ability to enchant the alienated, marginalized William Dodge into their embrace. United by their movement in time to the music of the gramophone, they embody the idea, expressed later in the text, that "Music wakes us. Music makes us see the hidden, join the broken" (<i>BTA</i>, 120). Not only does dancing embody the redemptive, healing powers of music: it also res a sacralized, primitivist connection to nature, representing, in this text haunted by droning airplanes, a resistance to modernity and the coming war. When Miss La Trobe watches swallows in the woods that are "a church without a roof . . . an open-air cathedral," she sees them "dancing, like the Russians, not only to music, but to the unheard rhythm of their own wild hearts" (<i>BTA</i>, 65).<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Whether connecting across classes to form a coherent English heritage and identity, or to a sacralized nature, to overcome modern alienation, dance holds out the promise, at key points throughout the text, of the "unity" that echoes throughout <i>Between the Acts</i> as the goal amidst private and public strife.  </p>

<p>Yet while unity means the overcoming of class differences and alienation, this text, as many readers have pointed out, is haunted by the spectre of fascism, and unity can connote the frightening collectivism of National Socialism.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  William's entrancement is inverted later when the audience is "all caught and caged; prisoners; watching a spectacle. Nothing happened. The tick of the machine was maddening" (<i>BTA</i>, 176). As the pageant play enters the present moment, the music switches to jazz dances, providing dissonant musical accompaniment for the modern message of liberation through technology: "Each of us a free man; plates washed by machinery; not an aeroplane to vex us; all liberated; made whole . . . ." The dishwasher's promise of modern wholeness is immediately subverted by the effects of the music: "The tune changed; snapped; broke; jagged . . . . What a cackle, a cacophony!" The new generation has arrived in scare quotes: "'the young'" who "shiver into splinters the old vision; smash to atoms what was whole" (<i>BTA</i>, 183). With the continued plea from the old that "what we need is a centre" (<i>BTA</i>, 198), the text concludes with irresolution of the conflict between tradition and modernity, heritage, and youth; "Dispersed are we" the text echoes again and again. In having Miss La Trobe find refuge in "wonderful words" (<i>BTA</i>, 212) and by ending the novel with the words "They spoke" (<i>BTA</i>, 219) as the opening of a new act in the marriage of Isa and Giles, Woolf turns away from the spectacle of dance, the embodiment of a potentially unifying music that threatens to erase the idiosyncratic identities that the novel ultimately holds dear; the values of the novel lie with the "cacophany" of jazz precisely because of its disruptions. </p>

<p>While the ability of dance scenes to stage fluctuations in the recuperation and disintegration of English collective identity is an important element of Woolf's modernism, 

<b></b>

 her attention to the particular experiences of individual female dancers should by no means be overlooked. Rachel Vinrace, Sara Pargiter, and Miss La Trobe have all been mentioned; just as important are the ways Jinny in <i>The Waves</i>, Fanny Elmer in <i>Jacob's Room</i>, and Lily Briscoe in <i>To the Lighthouse</i> are represented as dancers, either literally or metaphorically. The most significant sensibility that Woolf brings into her representations of dance, in these instances, echoes her exploration of dance with Rachel Vinrace: dangerous foreboding. "Here is my risk," thinks Jinny of the social world she inhabits as a dancer: "I am carried off. We yield to this slow flood. We go in and out of this hesitating music. Rocks break the current of the dance; it jars, it shivers."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  The threatening currents of watery dance recall the eddies of <i>The Voyage Out</i>, and can be found in <i>Jacob's Room</i> as well, where Fanny Elmer, caught up in an aching longing of unrequited passion for Jacob, watches dancers with him, and imagines herself one of them:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Then there she was herself, whirling across the stage in white flounces, and the music was the dance and fling of her own soul, and the whole machinery, rock and gear of the world was spun smoothly into those swift eddies and fall, she felt . . . never was there a more irrational passion. And Jacob was afraid of her for a moment—so violent, so dangerous is it when young women stand rigid; grasp the barrier; fall in love.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Given Woolf's propensity to represent dance as threatening when experienced by women, and to re dance as dangerous eddies, her use of dance to re Lily Briscoe's artistic process conveys Jinny's "risk," Fanny's "irrational passion," and Rachel's "'He's made me furious!'" Lily is Woolf's paramount re of the artist as defier of convention, refuser of conformity to courtship, marriage, and domesticity. It is crucial then that her painting should be represented as dance, that formulaic narrative technique for introducing boy to girl, yet in keeping with Woolf's modernist, ironic subversion of convention. Here is Lily painting:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The brush descended. It flickered brown over the white canvas; it left a running mark. A second time she did it—a third time. And so pausing and so flickering, she attained a dancing rhythmical movement, as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another, and all were related; and so, lightly and swiftly pausing, striking, she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed (she felt it looming out at her) a space. Down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her. For what could be more formidable than that space? Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with people into the presence of the formidable ancient enemy of hers—this other thing, this truth, this reality, which suddenly laid hands on her . . . .<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Art, after all, is a dance: it is a rhythmical form of combat that puts its practioner into play with forces out of her control. "Striking," "nervous," "looming," "formidable": the artist's position is precarious, her dance bristling with tension and anxiety. To repeat: dance may seem to offer a comforting group identity, a sense of community. Yet it also 

<b></b>

 picks up its participant and whirls her around in ways not entirely pleasant. One can lose oneself in dance, or find that the <i>temptation</i> of dance is exactly its promise of an only evanescent sociality. For Woolf, dance could mean danger, a meaning certainly to be found in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most powerful use of dance to re danger in Woolf's work occurs in the three instances in which the word "shindy" is used in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>.  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In a public house in a back street a Colonial insulted the House of Windsor which led to words, broken beer glasses, and a general shindy which echoed strangely across the way in the ears of girls buying white underlinen threaded with pure white ribbon for their weddings.

<p class="continued">Woolf uses the term "shindy," which refers to a sailor's dance and means spree, merrymaking, row, or commotion, in part to undermine authority, or to diminish the stature of something, in the case of Septimus referring to war. "Shindy" is a colloquial term; it shows Woolf delving into the common language; in this sense too, Woolf defies authority, delving into the linguistic "low" to challenge the "high." But perhaps most importantly, the events described as shindies are <i>violent</i> encounters—conflict between a colonial subject and royal power/royal supporters; war; drunken women in a brawl, under the shadow of police surveillance. The shindy betokens irreconcilable differences, and puts on highly visible display not harmony, but discord; not the solution, but the problem. In anticipation of the dance halls and nightclubs Mass-Observation would observe a little more than a decade later, Woolf depicted London as a fractious social dance. Given how ubiquitous dance is in Woolf's fiction, it is striking that it <i>only</i> appears as a metaphorical "shindy" in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>.  </p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> ends with a party where there is no dancing, yet shadows of meaning hover around its absence. "'I had meant to have dancing,' said Clarissa . . . . 'I had hoped to have dancing'"(<i>MD</i>, 177–78).<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Dancing marks the difference between her generation and the next.  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>For the young people could not talk. And why should they?

They would solidify young. They would be good beyond measure to the people on the estate, but alone, perhaps, rather dull. </p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">If dancing precludes the power of the English language to communicate feelings, Woolf has written into the ending of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> a lesson or gift from Clarissa to the next generation: the absence of dancing requires them to talk instead. Woolf, I suggest, wanted people not to dance, but to communicate feeling in language. Recall Woolf retreating to a corner to read at a dance. Alienated as a young woman from the dance scene, she discovered in her reading corner a liberation <i>from</i>, not to, dance. More specifically, the end of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> transposes into fiction an incident that underscores how the frenetic interwar embrace of dance could instill in its observers a certain dread. In June 1920, Woolf recorded in great detail her sister's account of a young man's death in the middle of a party, the source, perhaps, for Clarissa's experience of "in the middle of my party, here's death" (<i>MD</i>, 183). A young man stepped out over the edge of a roof on which people had gathered, and fell thirty feet on to the flagstones below. He died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital: the young man's death stopped the dance. Woolf writes, "Nessa says the younger generation is callous. No one was upset; some telephoned for news of other dances . . . . A strange event—to come to a dance among strangers &amp; die—to come dressed in evening clothes, &amp; then for it all to be over, instantly, so senselessly."<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup> </p>

<p>It is well known that Woolf's fiction is profoundly elegaic, and that it derives from convergences of private and public loss.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Yet I know of no interpretation that observes the remarkable occurrence of a <i>death involving social dancing</i> as a source for <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s poetics of mourning. The "strange event" recorded in Woolf's diary is a striking, literal referent for the idea of "the dangerous art where one slip means death," as well. Woolf began composing "On Not Knowing Greek" in 1922, two years after the "strange event" and during the composition of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>; both are memorials to the young man whose death stopped the dance, and after which no one was upset. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Coda: "the dancers, trained to liveliness . . . . Here is LIFE" 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The redemptive and emancipatory value of dance has been overemphasized, in effect obscuring the importance of Woolf's meaningful exclusion of dance from <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s final party. According to the aesthetics of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, dance did not provide synthesis, integration, community, female liberation, emancipation from machine culture, therapeutic primitivism, or ameliorative re-enchantment. Dance, instead, was for Woolf a form of callousness; translated into the psychoanalytic terminology of the interwar years, dance was a form of manic defense, a denial of the inner life, a loss of values and an inability to mourn: the pathology of happiness with which D. W. Winnicott was experimenting when he observed dancers "trained to liveliness" as possibly abnormal. <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s violent "shindy" replaces the actual social dancing that provided inspiration for a book about death in the middle of a party; war trauma became the cause of death, but "shindy" contains the secret link between violence in everyday life (the latent tensions of social dancing) and the violence of wars whose roots are, ultimately, the confrontations between natives and foreigners, different races and ethnicities, and competing national sentiments that Mass-Observation encountered in dance halls. 

<b></b>

 Social dancing provided a glimpse of possibilities—multicultural, cosmopolitan, class-, generation-, and gravity-defying possibilities—whose difficulty was widely felt. Woolf turned away from dance, toward words, constructing in her fiction an idea of dance as danger that helped her, as well as others, fortify the individual and the inner life in their argument with the world. Whether they won or lost remains the question we dance around when we wrestle with modernist fiction's haunting power. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT18" href="#REF18">18</a>. Before joining Diaghilev's ballet in 1916, Lopokova performed vaudeville in American music halls after leaving Russia in 1910. Beginning in 1918, she danced for London audiences in the various music halls such as the Alhambra, where Diaghilev's ballet performed, was introduced to Bloomsbury, and married Keynes in 1925. Clearly, Lopokova was more than charming to some audiences. Cyril Beaumont, adoring chronicler of the Russian Ballet in London, recalled Lopokova dancing "like a Maenad and [she] electrified the audience with the sheer joy and seemingly boundless vitality of her movements." Offstage, according to Beaumont, "[s]he spoke English well, with an attractive accent, and had a habit of making a profound remark as though it were the merest badinage." She was "very intelligent and witty, and, unlike some dancers, her conversation was not limited to herself and the Ballet." Cyril Beaumont, <i>The Diaghilev Ballet in London: A Personal Record</i> (London: Adam and Charles Black, 1951), 111, 115, and 116. Bloomsbury's derision of Lopokova has been well documented in Robert Skidelsky's biography of Keynes. See Robert Skidelsky, <i>John Maynard Keynes. Volume Two: The Economist as Savior, 1927–1937</i> (New York: Penguin, 1992). </p>

I have focused here on "The Chestnut Tree" instead because it is less well known to scholars of Mass-Observation. Mass-Observation was interested in the "Lambeth Walk" as a dance that combined a genuine working-class art form and commercialization; did this constitute community? Mass-Observation admitted without lamenting the commercial forces that constitute the popular. In 

<b></b>

 their interpretation, they also emphasized the roles of cultural producers in forging a popular fad, and viewed the spectacle of 3,000 dancers and spectators of the "Lambeth Walk" as anti-fascist. Thus there are many parallels between the more well-known "Lambeth Walk" and "<small class="caps">t</small>he Chestnut Tree". On the "Lambeth Walk," see Mass-Observation, <i>Britain</i>, intro.

In her recent work on Woolf, Christine Froula provides an extremely valuable reading of this scene that emphasizes the redemptive power of dance: "Seeing things new by the light of the impromptu Post-Impressionist spectacle Rachel's playing conjures, the community . . . celebrates both her future and a revelatory vision of its own." Christine Froula, <i>Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Avant-Garde: War, Civilization, Modernity</i> (New York: Columbia UP, 2005), 52. Similarly, Mark Wollaeger reads Rachel's performance as "breaking up and reassembling older social and aesthetic forms in a virtuoso performance of her independence." Mark Wollaeger, "The Woolfs in the Jungle: Intertextuality, Sexuality, and the Emergence of Female Modernism in <i>The Voyage Out</i>, <i>The Village in the Jungle</i>, and <i>Heart of Darkness</i>," in <i>Modern Language Quarterly</i> 64:1 , 41. Wollaeger goes on to note that "Rachel's release from tradition is <i>only temporary</i>," and Froula begins her discussion with "Rachel makes a spontaneous intervention in the social rituals of mating and marriage that leads the whole company <i>momentarily</i> to see things new" (Froula, <i>The Bloomsbury Avant-Garde</i>, 51; emphases mine). In my reading, the temporary and momentary are crucial. See also Haller, "The Quill Drawn from the Firebird," who focuses only on the Russian ballet's influence on <i>The Voyage Out</i>. </p>
