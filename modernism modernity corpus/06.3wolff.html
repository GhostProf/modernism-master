In October 1994, I was invited by the Whitney Museum of American Art to
develop a proposal for an exhibition in the Museum's series "Collection
in Context."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The series, which began in June, 1993, with an exhibition on <I>Edward
 Hopper in Paris</I>, has consisted of shows "featuring key works in
 the Whitney Museum's Permanent Collection," with the intention "not to
 isolate the works exhibited, but rather to set them in two different
 but related contexts: first, as products of their original time and
 place; second, in terms of their relevance to contemporary critics and
 today's audiences."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The exhibitions have been conceived and organized by outside curators,
 scholars, and artists; they are displayed in a single room (about 40
 feet by 23 feet in size) on the first floor of the Museum, typically
 running for about three months each. Other themes of exhibitions in the
 series include <I>Gorky's Betrothals</I>, <I>A Year from the Collection,
 circa 1952</I>, <I>Joseph Cornell: Cosmic Travels</I>, and <I>Breuer's
 Whitney--Anniversary Exhibition</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My invitation encouraged me to develop a proposal that would bring
feminist scholarship to the project. Since my own interests are primarily
in art of the early twentieth century, I decided to focus on women artists
from that period whose work was prominent in the collection when the
Museum opened in November, 1931. It became clear that this would involve
looking at social networks and art circles connected with Gertrude
Vanderbilt Whitney and her assistant (and later the first Director of
the Museum), Juliana Force, and particularly the Whitney Studio Club,
which operated from 1918 to 1928. Eventually--this was rather an extended
process, depending

<B></B>

on visits to New York and finding time between other commitments--I
submitted a proposal in January, 1996, suggesting an exhibition of
the work of some of these women artists--sixteen works, by fourteen
artists. After another delay (and a change of curator at the Whitney), I
arranged to go to New York and look at the works themselves. (So far, I
had only been able to look at reproductions at the Museum. All the work
I was interested in--and this itself is part of the story--had long been
in storage in the Whitney's warehouse in downtown Manhattan.) This visit
to look at the paintings, which I did in the company of the Curator
of the Permanent Collection, proved to be more or less decisive. In
short, our joint assessment seemed to be that the work simply did not
merit exhibition. I postponed the decision for a few months, but more
or less abandoned any idea of doing this show--at least at the Whitney
Museum--by early 1997.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story of the non-materialization of the exhibition is, I think, an
interesting one, and one that raises many questions. The point is that in
retrospect (and actually very soon after these events) I began to question
this ostensibly "aesthetic" judgement. On a couple of occasions I showed
slides of the work in the context of talks I gave on the subject, and
each time at least some of those present expressed real interest in the
images and encouraged me to pursue the idea of an exhibition. I started
to ask myself what was involved in the assessment of these paintings as
uninteresting or second-rate. It occurred to me, too, that the conditions
under which we had viewed the works were far from ideal--having them
taken from storage and propped on the floor by a couple of the warehouse
employees, all the time aware that each request meant more work for them
(though they were certainly willing and helpful, and I'm sure this was
a normal part of their everyday job). As a novice curator (I had only
organized one other exhibition), I was also aware that I was deferring
to some extent to the judgment of the Whitney curator who was with me.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Looking back on it, I realized that my disappointment in the work
 was--at least amongst other things--very much a product of my own
 aesthetic (modernist) prejudices, which coincided with, and were
 strongly reinforced by, those of the Whitney (here, in the person of
 the curator). Not long after my visit to New York to view the work, the
 art critic of the <I>New York Times</I> wrote a scathing and sarcastic
 review of the current exhibition in the "Collection in Context series,"
 which showed the work of Raphael Monta&ntilde;ez Ortiz, in which he
 dismissed the academic pretensions of its curator and responded to his
 description of the artist, in the accompanying brochure, as "one of
 the central res in a now-forgotten international movement" with
 the comment "It certainly is."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The last thing I wanted, of course, was a review of an exhibition of
 the "Whitney women" which both denigrated the work and at the same time
 implied that the display of such second-rate work was the consequence
 of misguided feminist revisionism. But the fact that I was already
 predicting such a review was, I now think, a measure not so much of
 my uncertainty in the face of art-world experts, but of my collusion
 in what has been, for the past half-century, the aesthetic orthodoxy
 in the history of art--namely, the elevation of modernist and abstract
 art over realism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The work that I was interested in, and which I proposed including in
 the small exhibition,

<B></B>

was realist painting, in the relatively progressive style of the Ashcan
School but not at all influenced by the more avant-garde developments
(cubism, fauvism, Futurism) already well established in Europe and
visible in the work of other New York artists as early as 1910.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 It became clear that my project, which started out as the rather
 unexciting one of feminist retrieval (reclaiming women artists "hidden
 from history"), might not be about gender at all, since the post-war
 modernist orthodoxy marginalized realist work by men in just the
 same way.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In this essay, I relate the progress of my research and thought as it
 developed, and in particular the ways in which the question of gender
 was superseded first by sociological questions of patronage, networks,
 and social influence, and then by the broader issue of the historical
 development of key institutions and their aesthetic ideologies. Finally,
 inspired by the recent work of feminist scholars of modernism and
 modernity, I came to see that this was, after all, very much a feminist
 project, though not in the way I had at first envisaged. If we can
 characterize feminist revisionism (rediscovering women artists and
 incorporating them into the canon) as 1970s feminism, then I would say
 (at the risk of equally broad generalization) that the Whitney project
 became one of 1990s feminism--the analysis of gender construction as
 it operates in the field of modern art and its institutions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Whitney Museum of American Art opened in November 1931. Its founding
collection consisted of nearly 700 works of art, about 200 of them
acquired since January 1930 when plans for the Museum were officially
announced.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 All of these works had been in the collections of Gertrude Vanderbilt
 Whitney, the Museum's founder, and Juliana Force, her assistant since
 1907 and the Museum's first Director (1931-1948), and most had been
 acquired in the context of the three institutions which had preceded
 and resulted in the opening of the Museum in 1931--the Whitney Studio
 (1914-1918), the Whitney Studio Club (1918-1928), and the
 Whitney Studio Galleries (1928-1930). The first of these, the
 Whitney Studio, was founded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (who had
 herself been working as a sculptor in a studio in Greenwich Village since
 1907), initially as a place to organize an art exhibition for the benefit
 of war relief (<I>ROES</I>, 111). For the next four years, Whitney and
 Force organized exhibitions at the Whitney Studio, wide-ranging in
 their scope, but emphasizing the work of young American artists. In
 1918, they found new premises (a brownstone on West Fourth Street),
 which they opened as the Whitney Studio Club, with Juliana Force as
 its director. The new Club combined exhibition space with recreational
 rooms and a library, and it continued an active exhibition program for
 the next ten years. It was disbanded in 1928, having grown too large,
 and was replaced by the Whitney Studio Galleries, with the narrower
 aim of exhibiting and selling work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 This in turn was closed in 1930, once the decision was made to found
 a permanent Museum.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The catalogue of the collection, published at the Museum's opening in
1931, includes about 500 paintings (oil and watercolor), 115 pieces
of sculpture, and "drawings, etchings, lithographs and works in other
mediums, to the number of seven hundred," all, of course, the work of
American artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Some of the names listed 

<B></B>

are familiar today, including some "Ashcan" painters and other realists
associated with the Art Students' League (George Bellows, William
Glackens, Robert Henri, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, Reginald Marsh,
Kenneth Hayes Miller, John Sloan, Arthur Davies and Maurice Prendergast)
and one or two American modernists (Stuart Davis, and one work each by
Marsden Hartley and Georgia O'Keeffe). There is one Edward Hopper, and
a few works by Precisionist artists Charles Sheeler, Elsie Driggs, and
Charles Demuth. Most striking is the fact that many of the most prominent
names in the catalogue (that is, the artists with several works in the
collection) are not well known--Arnold Blanch, Lucile Blanch, Ernest
Fiene, Emil Ganso, Anne Goldthwaite, Leon Hartl, Joseph Pollet, Paul
Rohland, Katherine Schmidt, Niles Spencer, and a few others. These are
the names, though, that appear with great frequency in the records of
exhibitions held at the Whitney Studio, the Whitney Studio Club and the
Whitney Studio Galleries in the sixteen years leading up to the founding
of the Museum.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In other words, they are the names of the artists supported by Whitney
 and Force during that period, whose work was often bought at their
 Whitney exhibitions, and who were, for the most part, active participants
 in the Club and regular members of the social networks in which Juliana
 Force in particular operated. They were connected with one another
 through their artistic training (in many cases, at the Art Students'
 League) and through social contact and, in some cases, marriage. (The
 artists Peggy Bacon and Alexander Brook were married to each other, as
 were Katherine Schmidt and Yasuo Kuniyoshi, all of them central players
 in the Whitney enterprise.) Many of them had summer homes in the art
 colony in Woodstock, in up-state New York, particularly in the period
 beginning in the early 1920s; Juliana Force herself was a frequent
 visitor there (<I>ROES</I>, 230).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 What they also had in common was a commitment to a contemporary realist
 aesthetic, learned in many cases from their teachers at the Art Students'
 League (Henri, Sloan, and Miller).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I had begun research for this project by identifying the women artists
in the Museum's collection who were active in the years leading up to
the founding of the Museum in 1931. Since I was using the Museum's card
index, which only includes works currently owned by the Museum, this
did not give me access to those few women artists whose work has since
been de-accessioned--these I discovered later, in looking at the 1931
catalogue and at other records.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 I also decided to limit my focus to works made in the period, but also
 <I>acquired</I> then (that is, in 1931 or soon after), since my interest
 was in the events and practices of the Whitney institutions at the time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 So, for example, a work by the artist Florine Stettheimer, though
 painted in 1931, was not included because it was not acquired by the
 Museum until 1973.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 I was also well aware that Juliana Force engaged in a program of
 rather energetic "corrective buying" immediately before the opening
 of the Museum. The inclusion of one work by Georgia O'Keeffe (<I>Skunk
 Cabbage</I>, 1922), bought by Force in 1931 and followed by the purchase
 of two more O'Keeffes the next year and a fourth in 1933, has to be seen
 in a context in which the prospect of a permanent museum of American
 art, something very different from a private collection or a studio club,

<B></B>

forced the recognition of important gaps in the collection and of the
necessity to do something about this (<I>ROES</I>, 303-4).
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Avis Berman, a historian of the Whitney Museum and of Juliana Force's
 role in its development, records the results of Force's hectic
 "shopping trips" over a period of a couple of years, and of her
 acquisitions. Particularly interesting was the accommodation reached
 with Alfred Stieglitz and the American modernist artists associated with
 his gallery--O'Keeffe, Marin, Hartley, Dove. The absence of friendly
 relations between Whitney and Stieglitz over the years had long been
 clear (Stieglitz had opened his first gallery for modern American art,
 The Photo-Secessionist Gallery, or 291, in 1905), as had the radically
 different aesthetic commitments of the two institutions and their
 associated artists. But in 1931 Juliana Force was making a serious
 attempt to rectify imbalances in the Whitney's collection, which meant
 the purchase of more avant-garde, European-influenced work. Nevertheless,
 this last-minute corrective buying, though obviously important in the
 formation of the Museum, should not obscure either the dominant tendency
 in the Whitney circle or the particular sociology of artistic production
 in the pre-1931 period; nor, in the end, did it make a great deal of
 difference to the continuing practices of the Museum, once founded.

I compiled a list of twenty-four women artists, active in the Whitney
circle in the period before the opening of the Museum. Seventeen of these
women had work included in the catalogue at the opening of the Museum in
1931. Interestingly, too, eleven of the twenty-five were also included
in the 1949 Whitney exhibition which served as a memorial to Juliana
Force (who had died the previous year) and which still manifested a
predominantly realist aesthetic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 (See <A NAME="app" HREF="#appendix">Appendix</A>.) Most of these artists had an active exhibition
 record with the various incarnations of the Whitney Studio. They
 were represented regularly in group shows, and several of them had
 one-person shows--in some cases, more than once. Molly Luce, Dorothea
 Schwarcz, Rosella Hartman (<A HREF="6.3wolff_1.html"> 1</A>),
 and Georgina Klitgaard each had exhibitions of their work. Katherine
 Schmidt (<A HREF="6.3wolff_2.html"> 2</A>), Lucile Blanch (<A
 HREF="6.3wolff_3.html"> 3</A>), Caroline Rohland, and Dorothy
 Varian (<A HREF="6.3wolff_4.html"> 4</A>) had two one-person
 shows; and Nan Watson (<A HREF="6.3wolff_5.html"> 5</A>)
 had four one-person shows. Peggy Bacon, who exhibited her prints
 and drawings regularly at other New York galleries in the 1920s and
 1930s, was included frequently in the Whitney Studio Club exhibitions
 (<A HREF="6.3wolff_6.html"> 6</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 It is clear that women artists were able to thrive in the context of the
 Whitney Studio Club. According to Berman, women accounted for between
 30 and 35 percent of works exhibited in the Whitney exhibitions and
 the Whitney and Force collections. She quotes Juliana Force's nephew,
 who stresses his aunt's firm belief in the equality of women: "She
 believed in applying the same standards to men and women alike. She
 would never use the once-familiar 'aviatrix' any more than she would
 say 'painteress.' Years later, as a museum director, she refused
 to hold special exhibits for women artists on the grounds that this
 was condescending to women" (<I>ROES</I>, 134). (This is not to say,
 however, that the usual processes of gender selectivity were not in
 play at the time, including in the critical response to the Whitney's
 activities. The art critic, Henry McBride, reviewing the opening
 exhibition of the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1931, does

<B></B>

not mention a single woman artist by name, but makes a point of listing
twelve male artists who are, for him, the stars of the show.)

If the relative success of women artists in the Whitney circle is
apparent, then so is the (relatively) gender-neutral decline of their
reputations in later years. Soon after the 1949 Memorial Exhibition at the
Whitney, in which several of them were still exhibiting work, the museum
became far more receptive to European-influenced modern art, including
abstraction. The international success of Abstract Expressionism in the
1950s rendered it imperative that <I>the</I> Museum of American Art play
an active part in exhibiting and acquiring the work. Under the next two
Directors after Force's death in 1948--Herman More (1948-1958)
and Lloyd Goodrich (1958-1968)--the Whitney Museum's aesthetic
was radically transformed. More wrote, in the foreword of the 1950
Annual Exhibition catalogue: "If modern art in its many forms, such as
expressionism, abstraction, and surrealism, predominates in the show, it
is because it is the leading movement in art today, and has influenced
the greatest number of younger artists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In 1954, the Museum moved from its original location in adjacent
 townhouses in Greenwich Village to a building on West 54th Street, near
 the Museum of Modern Art (and in fact owned by the

<B></B>

Museum of Modern Art).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 The display of works in the context of a more "modern" building
 coincided with the move towards a conception of "modern art" which
 was defined by the Museum of Modern Art (and originally by its first
 Director, Alfred Barr) and already more or less established as the
 art-historical orthodoxy in America and Western Europe. The narrative
 of this story, elaborated in Barr's famous diagram in the 1936 Museum
 of Modern Art Catalogue, <I>Cubism and Abstract Art</I>, and developed
 by his successors (critics and curators in New York), traces a line
 of development from Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, to Cubism,
 Surrealism and, eventually, Abstract Expressionism (and, thus, from
 Paris to New York).
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Among the obvious consequences of the acceptance of this narrative is the
 marginalization of realism in the twentieth century. After the second
 World War, the Museum of Modern Art story was not only the dominant
 one; it was, at least in educated circles in the art world, the only
 story. The Whitney's belated subscription to this version of the canon,
 and to the aesthetic which upheld it, had the practical corollary of
 consigning a good deal of the work of the Whitney Studio Club members
 to storage. This reassessment affected the work of men as well as women
 artists. Paintings by Whitney Studio Club artists Alexander Brook,
 Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Guy P&egrave;ne du Bois (<A HREF="6.3wolff_7.html">7</A>) suffered the same

<B></B>

fate, with the ascendancy of modernism over realism in the post-war
Whitney Museum.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
During the two decades before the founding of the Whitney Museum, it
was still possible to pursue and promote an aesthetic other than the
Euro-modernist version. Certainly modernism was already much in evidence
in New York during the years of the Whitney Studio and the Whitney
Studio Club. Stieglitz's gallery, after all had been founded in 1905,
and remained an important exhibition space for modernist painting and
photography. The 1913 Armory Show had introduced European avant-garde
movements--notably cubism and fauvism--to American audiences, and had also
included work by American modernists (Marin, Hartley, Morgan Russell,
Davis, and others). In 1920, Katharine Dreier and Marcel Duchamp had
founded the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme, "America's first museum of
modern art," which showed European and American modernist art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 In 1927, A. E. Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art opened at New York
 University, showing Gallatin's own collection of modern art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 And the Museum of Modern Art was itself founded in 1929, based on the
 private collections of European modern art of Lillie Bliss and Mary
 Sullivan, and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller's collection of American folk
 and modern art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Several galleries and

<B></B>

dealers in New York exhibited modernist art (the Daniel Gallery, the
Montross Gallery, the Modern Gallery, Kraushaar's and Wildenstein's
among others).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Collectors like John Quinn and Duncan Phillips were buying European and
 American modernist works in the first decades of the century. At the
 same time, it was entirely possible in this period for a non-modernist
 aesthetic to flourish alongside these developments. Gertrude Vanderbilt
 Whitney's taste was for early twentieth-century American realism, of a
 type that was in fact considered progressive in its time. She bought
 four of the seven paintings sold at the ground-breaking 1908 Macbeth
 Gallery exhibition of The Eight--the so-called "Ashcan" painters of
 realist urban scenes (Henri, Luks, Sloan and others) who were showing
 work very different from, and opposed to, the prevailing academic
 traditions. At the Whitney Studio and the Studio Club, she and Juliana
 Force continued to exhibit the work of such artists, as well as the
 younger artists who had studied with them. Their taste, then, though not
 avant-garde, was forward-looking in terms of then current established
 aesthetic conventions. Their hostility to modernism, too, should not be
 exaggerated. (Berman suggests that the Whitney Studio Clib is better seen
 as anti-Stieglitz, rather than anti-modern, <I>ROES</I>, 223). Whitney
 herself was involved in planning for the radical 1913 Armory Show. She
 supported the photographer Edward Steichen in the rather peculiar court
 case in 1926-27, in which he attempted to convince the U.S. Customs
 that Brancusi's ultra-modernist sculpture, <I>Bird in Space</I>, was
 in fact art, and therefore exempt from import duty; Whitney took over
 the appeal and met all Steichen's costs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The Whitney Studio Club also exhibited and supported some modernist
 artists, including Stuart Davis and Oscar Bluemner, and sponsored
 individual modernist shows (for example, Mario de Zayas's important
 Picasso exhibition at the Whitney Studio Club in 1923). But the overall
 tendency is clear, and all the more so in the light of those concurrent
 developments in the New York art world. As Adam Weinberg says, "In a
 cursory examination of the Whitney's exhibition program, publications,
 and acquisitions from the founding of the Whitney Studio Club in 1918
 until Juliana Force's death in 1948, the record does substantiate an
 overwhelming emphasis on realist artists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the Whitney Studio Club, the high visibility of women artists, and
their success in terms of exhibition and sales, has to be seen as the
product of a complex social network of friendships, patronage, and
personal relationships.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Both the access to Force and Whitney (and thus to exhibition and
 sales) and the shared aesthetic were related aspects of these close
 interactions. Several of the artists were founder members of the
 Whitney Studio Club (Schmidt, Varian, Watson, Bacon, Dwight; Isabel
 Bishop joined in 1920). The Woodstock connection, already referred
 to, was an important structural feature in the interplay of social and
 professional relations, as was the shared history of training at the
 Art Students' League (where Schmidt, Bacon, Varian, Luce and Bishop
 had studied, as well as Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Alexander Brook).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Mabel Dwight worked as secretary-receptionist for Force at the Whitney
 Studio Club in its early days; Katherine Schmidt ran the Club's evening
 sketch class for two years; and Alexander Brook (the husband of Peggy
 Bacon) acted as Force's

<B></B>

assistant from 1923 until 1927 (<I>ROES</I>, 157, 195-96, 239). The
artist Nan Watson (who had four one-person shows, and who had the fourth
largest number of works in the collection when the Museum opened in

not only maintained close connections with the Whitney circle but was
also Juliana Force's lover for twelve years, from 1919.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 A sociology of cultural production and reception in the Whitney circle
 would certainly focus on the patterns of influence and decision
 which emerged from these and other connections, as well as on the
 particular relations between the Whitney artists and the many other
 New York art institutions (galleries, critics, schools) against which
 they were defined. It is likely, though, that what now seems the rather
 unprofessional (though perhaps not so unusual) set of art-world relations
 in which the Whitney artists operated provided the very conditions in
 which women could succeed on the same terms as men.

The ascendancy and post-war consolidation of the "Museum of Modern Art
narrative" had the effect of producing an impressive collective amnesia
in American visual culture. The history of early American art has been,
for the past fifty years, the story of the emergence and eventual success
of the American avant-garde. The more comprehensive surveys of American
art do include discussion of American Impressionism and the "Ashcan"
painters, though artists in the Whitney circle are rarely considered.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Even in these accounts, though, the realist painters of the "Ashcan"
 group are often treated as a necessary, but quickly surpassed, stage on
 the way to modernism. This statement, from a catalogue introduction to
 a 1997 exhibition of the work of The Eight (the exhibitors in the 1908
 exhibition) is a typical account of this relationship:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
By breaking away from and rebelling against the narrow confines
of traditional art typically displayed at the National Academy of
Design, Henri and his seven colleagues effectively opened the door for
more innovation in painting in the United States. By exhibiting more
experimental, progressive work to a wide public audience, The Eight
helped created an environment more willing and able to accept the shocking
trends which would affront the American art community at the Armory Show
in 1913. The Eight's exhibition helped build an effective bridge between
the art  of the nineteenth century and the Modernism of the twentieth.

With the exception of general survey books on American art, until recently
most publications dealing with the early twentieth century have focused
on American modernism--the Armory Show and its consequences, the Stieglitz
artists, and the varieties of American modernism in the 1910s and 1920s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 (The 1930s return to realism, for example in work associated with
 the Works Projects Administration--an agency of the U. S. government
 created in 1935 to provide jobs, especially in public works--and with
 regionalism, is another matter. But even this work, impossible to ignore
 or write out of American art history, is invariably treated as a sub

The Whitney Museum itself was so radically transformed in the years after
Juliana Force's death that in 1960 a group of realist artists wrote to
the Director (then Lloyd Goodrich) about the lack of representational
art in the Museum's recent annual exhibition, pointing out that of
the 145 paintings included "102 were non-objective, 17 abstract and 17
semi-abstract, leaving only 9 paintings in which the image had not receded
or disappeared, whereas in former exhibitions the Whitney Museum showed
a much larger cross section of style and method in work in progress."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 As Adam Weinberg reports, Goodrich's reply admitted that "the abstract
 trend is dominant, particularly among the younger generation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Although Weinberg is concerned to stress the Whitney's long-standing
 openness to both realist and modernist (including abstract) art, the
 context of his essay is evidence of the Museum's postwar collusion
 in the privileging of modernism. It appears in a catalogue for a 1997
 exhibition at the Whitney, the third in a series called <I>Views from
 Abroad</I>, in which museum directors from other countries have been
 invited to curate work from the Whitney's Permanent Collection. This
 particular show was organized by Nicholas Serota and Sandy Nairne of the
 Tate Gallery in London and, as the <I>New Yorker</I> put it at the time,
 "This is American art viewed through eyes used to looking at Francis
 Bacon and Lucien Freud."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The curators entitled the exhibition "American Realities," and a
 major part of its project was to restore the rative tradition to
 visibility. Reflecting on the fact that the Tate had earlier displayed
 an exhibition of the work of American artists which had been organized by
 the Museum of Modern Art, Serota explains his interest in its omissions:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The exhibition played a small but influential part in transforming the
European assessment of American art from provincial and peripheral
to revolutionary, highly influential, and central to developments
worldwide. But this perception clearly obscured the existence of an
earlier, prewar cosmopolitanism, which manifested different forms of
radical modern ration . . . This led us on a track of the "real" for
"Views from Abroad." Admittedly using the term in an elastic way, we have
explored the idea of bringing particular, sometimes neglected, works to
critical attention and reviving a broader view of modernism which does
not regard an interest in the re as being, by definition, antimodern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Included in the exhibition, therefore, was work by du Bois, Sloan, Soyer,
Bishop, Luks, Marsh, and Driggs, alongside the more usual selection
of works by early modernists Dove, Hartley, O'Keeffe, and Avery, and
postwar modernists Pollock, Rothko, Kline, and Diebenkorn.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The exhibition was itself, I believe, an indication of an interesting
 development in museum practice and associated art-critical discourses
 (and, not incidentally, art market sales) in the past couple of years,
 namely the beginning of a reevaluation of the realist and rative
 tradition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Despite the signs of this very recent intervention, however, the dominant
 aesthetic, at the Whitney as else

<B></B>

where in the art world, has remained one founded in the story of
modernism and its postwar successors. There is some evidence of a
certain nervousness about the revival of the realist tradition, as two
minor anecdotes about my own Whitney proposal demonstrate. The first
was the suggestion made to me by the Whitney's curator that, although
an exhibition of the work of these women artists might not work for the
museum, I might propose it to the curator of a museum outside Manhattan.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 And the second was the rather surprising discovery that a year after my
 fateful (fatal) visit to New York to view the paintings, the Whitney
 did in fact mount a version of the show I was proposing, with the
 two differences that this was an exhibition only of works on paper by
 those women artists, and that it took place at the Whitney's branch in
 Champion, Connecticut.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 It seemed that the work was good enough for the provinces, but it could
 not (yet) be risked in New York City.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My inquiries into the invisibility of the "Whitney women" had quickly
made clear to me that this was not, after all, the feminist project
of rediscovering women artists who had been marginalized either in
relation to the conditions of cultural production or by the normal
practices of art-historical discourse--the project of the recovery of a
"hidden heritage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 These artists worked on equal terms with men, and apparently with more or
 less equivalent success and visibility at the time. Their disappearance,
 both from the Whitney's own display and from official histories of
 American art in general, was not a matter of gender prejudice either,
 but rather a consequence of the resolution of competing aesthetic
 narratives, a resolution which sidelined the work of male realist artists
 in (almost) the same measure as that of women. In the end, the exhibition
 I proposed to the Whitney was not a specifically feminist project, but
 one whose conceptual underpinning had much more to do with foregrounding
 a sociology of cultural production--the relevance and centrality of
 social relations and networks in the production and reception of
 art. As I have said, the decision not to take this further was an
 aesthetic one, based on an assessment of whether the paintings were
 worth exhibiting. At the time, I tried to think about this assessment
 in the light of what we have learned from feminist criticism over the
 past couple of decades, in an attempt to identify any deeper prejudices
 which might be gender-related. Feminist art historians have demonstrated
 the ways in which aesthetic hierarchies are clearly gender-based, with
 work associated with women (still life and flower painting, for example)
 invariably being considered "decorative" or "lesser arts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Critical work in feminist aesthetics has alerted us to certain
 androcentric tendencies in Western philosophy of art (for example,
 the gendering of the opposition of the beautiful and the sublime, and
 the inseparability of the practical and the personal--including gender
 identity--from the aesthetic for the spectator of a work of art).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 But there was no obvious difference in content or style between the
 work of the Whitney women and the paintings of Alexander Brook and Yasuo
 Kuniyoshi, nor did there seem to be any reason to suppose that questions
 of gender came into the appreciation or judgment of the works. The
 belated recognition that this was, after all, a feminist project followed
 instead from my subsequent doubts (and self-doubt) about the privileging
 of modernism over realism. The point is that the discourse of

<B></B>

modernism <I>is itself a masculinist discourse</I>. This means that the
marginalization of realism, though ostensibly an aesthetic move, is at
the same time fundamentally gendered. In this perspective, it does not
matter that some of the work thus denigrated happened to be made by men;
it is still gendered "feminine" by a discourse which produces modernism
as masculine. In the rest of this essay, I shall consider this question
of "the gender of modernism" as a way of returning to the Whitney women
and the problem of assessing their work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The recognition that modernism in the visual arts has always had
strong masculinist (and often misogynistic) tendencies is by now
well established. In an article first published in 1973, Carol Duncan
identified a preoccupation with virility in avant-garde painting in
the early twentieth century, an obsession which she relates to the
contemporary anxieties about the emancipation of women and their increased
participation in the public world of work and politics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 And much of Griselda Pollock's work has been concerned with addressing
 the question of "why the territory of modernism so often is a way of
 dealing with masculine sexuality and its sign, the bodies of women--why
 the nude, the brothel, the bar?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In another context, Andreas Huyssen has explored the nineteenth-century
 discourses which produced modernism as male, in this case in opposition
 to a mass culture which was gendered female.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 These gendered discourses of early modernism were then definitively
 reinforced by the post-war narrative of twentieth-century art
 history, seen from the vantage-point of the international success and
 prominence of the New York School. As Ann Gibson has recently shown,
 the invisibility of women and minority artists among the Abstract
 Expressionists (and there were plenty of these who were active in
 the late 1940s and early 1950s) is the necessary by-product of the
 universalizing ideology of this movement and its associated critics.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This universalism was delivered by men who aspired to be artistic
heroes. This claim, to which sympathetic contemporary viewers readily
responded and which subsequent historians have made specific, was not
seen as the movement's implicit story about itself, that is, as literary,
but simply as wondrous fact. . . . This notion established grounds for
the distinction that, in segregated America, only white heterosexual
males could attain: generating a universal product that could speak for
everyone. Women, African Americans, and avowed homosexuals could not do
that because their audiences would not accept their work as universal.

Michael Leja explains the andocentric nature of Abstract Expressionism in

"profoundly gendered."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 The point then, as he explains, is

<BLOCKQUOTE>

not to document the exclusion of women from Abstract Expressionism, but
rather to examine the processes and mechanisms by which that exclusion was
effected then and now. What made Abstract Expressionism so inhospitable

The re-writing of early twentieth-century American art from the point
of view of the 1950s--the project that I have suggested was involved
in the transformation of the Whitney's history--can now be seen as more
than a matter of aesthetic revision. The privileging of modernism in the
earlier period, in the production of a specific lineage for the New York
School, was also an exercise in engendering visual culture. In other
words, the marginalization of certain kinds of realist and rative
painting is the marginalization of the "feminine," a process which does
not necessarily have much to do with the question of whether the work
involved is by women or by men. This retroactive strategy has been able to
take up and restate those gender discourses around early modernism, with
their own tendency to equate the modern with the masculine. Although,
as Rita Felski has argued, the gender of modernity and of modernism
was relatively open-ended in the early twentieth century, so that the
androcentric discourses could still be contested and countered, and a
feminine/feminist "modernism" proposed, there is plenty of evidence of
what was to become the dominant narrative, in which the realist/feminine
was denigrated in relation to the modernist/masculine. This is clear in
the case of the contemporaneous establishment of the Whitney Museum and
the Museum of Modern Art. In an important and highly original study of the
contrasting display strategies of the two museums and their precursors in
the period 1913 to 1939, Evelyn Hankins has demonstrated the ascendancy
of the "modern" approach (the museum as white cube) in relation to the
"decorative" (moderne), the latter, characteristic of the Whitney's
displays, associated in contemporary criticism and discourse with the
feminine. In particular, the exhibition of works in the "domestic" setting
of the brownstones of the Whitney Studio Club and the Museum itself in
its early years, and the employment of Beaux-Arts architects and designers
to renovate the buildings, was in stark contrast to the Museum of Modern
Art, and it enabled a reading of the Whitney as a feminine space.

The invisibility of the Whitney artists in most histories of
twentieth-century American art is after all a feminist issue, inasmuch
as the denigration of realism has depended on a fundamentally gendered
discursive strategy. I want to conclude by considering the implications
of this for the current revival of interest in realist art, which I
referred to earlier. The critical challenge to "the Museum of Modern Art
story," for example in the 1997 "American Realities" exhibition at the
Whitney which reintegrated rative art into the history of American
art, is necessarily also a process of deconstructing the dominant gender
hierarchies of modernism and realism. And yet it is striking that there
were no women artists from the Whitney Studio Club included among the
realists in that show, with the exception of Isabel Bishop and Elsie
Driggs (<A HREF="6.3wolff_8.html"> 8</A>), neither of whom was quite typical of the Whitney artists
and their work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 (The same is true of the blockbuster Whitney exhibition, The American

<B></B>

Century, which opened as I was completing work on this essay).
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 It could be that this brings us back to the vexed question of "quality"
 (and hence full circle to my dilemma when confronted with the paintings).
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 But at the very least it suggests that we look carefully at both the
 aesthetic and the gender implications of the revival of realism in the
 late twentieth century, a revival which may, after all, still turn out
 to be on modernism's terms.

well known as, say, Arthur Dove or Marsden Hartley, their modernist
contemporaries, who have remained in favor throughout the century, it is
more likely that their work will be on display in exhibitions of American
art than that of their female counterparts. And, with regard to the WMAA's
adoption of the Museum of Modern Art aesthetic, Bruce Lineker stresses
the continuing attachment to its earlier realist tendencies: "For six
decades of American art, the surveys documented the Whitney Museum's
consistent support of the Realist tradition. One can also trace in the
exhibition program the emergence of abstraction in the 1930s and 1940s,
it's [sic] extraordinary success in Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s,
and abstraction's subsequent induction into the mainstream vocabulary
of American art. However, even when critical attention overwhelmingly
shifted toward abstraction, the program retained its original dedication
to realism" <I>(The Annual &amp; Biennial Exhibition Record of the
Whitney Museum of American Art</I>, 11-12).

This approach is well established among sociologists of culture, who
have long insisted on the importance of understanding artistic success
and canon-formation in terms of social relations of cultural production
and institutions--patrons, dealers, critics, museums, art schools,
art-critical discourses, and so on, which facilitate and enable (and,
of course, sometimes obstruct) such success. With regard to gender,
feminists have also answered Linda Nochlin's question, "Why have there
been no great women artists?" by focusing on the social relations and
institutions which exclude, or permit, women's participation in the making
of art. Nochlin's 1971 essay of this title is reprinted in Thomas B. Hess
and Elizabeth C. Baker, eds. <I>Art and Sexual Politics</I> (New York:
Collier Books, 1973), 1-39. For an interesting example of a study
of social networks and patronage in cultural production in a different
context, see David Morgan: "Cultural Work and Friendship Work: the Case of
'Bloomsbury,'" <I>Media, Culture and Society</I> 4 : 19-32.

Brown, for example, puts it like this: "After the [first world] war,
realism continued, with many changes in character, but as a minor
and neglected phase of American art." Unusually, Brook, Kuniyoshi and

women do, 167.

The issue of the invisibility of much American art within the discipline
of art history was addressed by Hemingway, <I>How the Tale of Art
Wags the Dog of History</I>. A marvellous example of this appears
in a recent publisher's catalogue, advertising a recent edition of
the reprinted essays of the art critic Henry McBride--one of the most
important critics in New York between about 1913 and 1950. The advert
gives prominent place is given to a line from a review of the book by
the art historian, Svetlana Alpers, who says: "Until I read this book
I had never heard of [McBride], but his collected reviews make for
good reading." It says something, of course, about the fate of early
twentieth-century art and art criticism that such a sentence stands as
a compliment. See "The Henry McBride Series in Modernism and Modernity
from Yale University," publisher's catalogue (New Haven: Yale University
Press, n. d. [but 1999]), 3.

Bishop has always maintained a certain status in histories of American
art, largely because of her importance as a member of the Fourteenth
Street School of urban realist painters. Driggs' 1927 painting,

exhibition, is unlike the work of her Whitney Studio Club contemporaries
in its more modernist, Precisionist, style.

A disconcerting little aside in a recent article about the Whitney Museum
of Modern Art in the late 1990s refers to the uncritical buying policies
of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, "who, lore has it, would sometimes
purchase a second-rate picture in an artist's show, knowing that the
best work would find another buyer" (Arthur Lubow, "The Curse of the
Whitney," <I>New York Times Magazine</I>, 11 April 1999, 58). See also
