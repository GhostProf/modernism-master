<p class="continued">This Afro-Caribbean poem for a Euromodernist traverses cultural, racial, and gender boundaries via intersections of place names&#x2014;Sligo, Sligoville; mythical heroes&#x2014;Ireland's Cuchulain, Jamaica's ex-slave rebels; and premodern magic&#x2014;Yeats's mysticism, Jamaica's skin-shedding witches and neck-chained, calf-like ghosts. Goodison Irishes Jamaica&#x2014;its hills become "shamrock green"&#x2014;and Jamaicanizes Ireland&#x2014;Cuchulain now has Afro-Caribbean "bush comrades." Apostrophizing a dead poet who often discoursed with the dead, Goodison writes, "William Butler, I swear my dead mother / embraced me. I then washed off my heart / with the amniotic water of a green coconut."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Conjoining myths and magic, topography and words across hemispheres, Goodison res her intercultural relationship with Yeats as 

<b></b>

reciprocal exchange ("We swap duppy stories"): his work has changed hers, and, notwithstanding chronology, her postcolonial reception of his metaleptically transforms it. Poetry, she suggests, is for crossing boundaries between the living and the dead, between times, places, cultures. The space of a poem is neither local&#x2014;a securely anchored signifier of Jamaican authenticity&#x2014;nor global&#x2014;a placeless, free-floating noumenon. It is a translocation, verbally enabling and enacting, between specific times and places, cross-cultural, transhistorical exchange.  </p>

<p>This intercultural conception of poetry is central both to Euromodernism and to what Martinican theorist and writer Edouard Glissant has called the cross-cultural poetics ("<i>po&#x00E9;tique de la Relation</i>") of the Caribbean.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Yet postcolonial criticism has sometimes represented the relation between postcolonialism and Euromodernism as adversarial. Now that the postmodern is no longer seen as an outright rejection of the modern, we also need to reconsider whether and to what extent postcolonial literatures repudiate or "write back to" an imperial Euromodernism. In his pathbreaking analysis of Afro-Caribbean fiction, Simon Gikandi offers a nuanced statement of the agonistic position: "Caribbean modernism is opposed to, though not necessarily independent of, European notions of modernism." Gikandi thus proposes a "Third World modernism distinct from the prototypical European form, which in Houston Baker's words, 'is exclusively Western, preeminently bourgeois, and optically white.'"<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The authors of <i>Toward the Decolonization of African Literature</i> assert a sharper divide: "African literature <i>is </i>an autonomous entity separate and apart from all other literatures. It has its own traditions, models and norms." The influence of Euromodernist "privatism" can only obscure authentic African expression under "dunghill piles of esoterica and obscure allusions."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Bill Ashcroft and John Salter represent modernism's influence beyond the metropole as unambiguously imperialist: "The high-cultural discourse of modernism, with its imposition of a set of largely uncontested parameters upon a non-European cultural reality, may be seen to be metonymic of the operation of imperial domination. Modernity and modernism are rooted in empire."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  </p>

<p>But far from being an obstruction that had to be dislodged from the postcolonial windpipe, Euromodernism&#x2014;in one of the great ironies of twentieth-century literary history&#x2014;crucially enabled a range of non-Western poets after World War II to explore their hybrid cultures and postcolonial experience. For these poets, the detour through Euromodernism was often, paradoxically, the surest route home. In his <i>History of the Voice</i>, Kamau Brathwaite offers one of the most vivid testaments to the importance of Euromodernism for the postcolonization of postcolonial literatures. T. S. Eliot, he asserts, was the primary influence on Caribbean poets "moving from standard English" to creolized English, or "nation language": "What T. S. Eliot did for Caribbean poetry and Caribbean literature was to introduce the notion of the speaking voice, the conversational tone. That is what really attracted us to Eliot." Emphasizing the oral/aural medium of transmission and thus assimilating Eliot to West Indian orature, Brathwaite further explains in a footnote: "For those who really made the breakthrough, it was Eliot's actual voice&#x2014;or rather his recorded voice, property of the British Council (Barbados)&#x2014;reading 'Preludes', 'The love song of J. Alfred Prufrock', <i>The Waste Land </i>

<b></b>

and later the <i>Four Quartets</i>&#x2014;not the texts&#x2014;which turned us on. In that dry deadpan delivery, the 'riddims' of St Louis (though we did not know the source then) were stark and clear for those of us who at the same time were listening to the dislocations of Bird, Dizzy and Klook. And it is interesting that, on the whole, the establishment could not stand Eliot's voice&#x2014;and far less jazz!" Brathwaite cites the parallel influence of a BBC cricket commentator's "natural, 'riddimic' and image<i>-</i>laden tropes in his revolutionary Hampshire burr": "he subverted the establishment with the way he spoke and where: like Eliot, like jazz . . .".<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> </p>

<p>Brathwaite hails Eliot for his conversational orality and jazz dislocations, his non-Standard diction and improvisatory rhythms. That a revolutionary afrocentrist could hear the flat British monotone of an Anglo-Catholic Royalist as subversive, could embrace Eliot as an antiestablishment poet for the 1950s and 1960s, might well seem bizarre, especially since for many North American poets of the time, Eliot <i>was</i> the establishment. When Robert Creeley, Allen Ginsberg, and Amiri Baraka turned to jazz as a model for improvisatory rhythms and phrasing, they were repudiating Eliot's academic embodiment in New Critical, formalist norms of coherence, polish, and impersonal wit. In a manifesto for the new American poetries, "Projective Verse" , Charles Olson implicitly mocks "O. M. Eliot" (that is, Order of Merit) for his imperial affinities.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Meanwhile, in Britain, Philip Larkin and other poets of the Movement were also renouncing Eliot and Pound, put off by their polyglossia, syntactic dislocations, and arcane mythologies. But while the Beats, the Black Mountain poets, poets of the Black Arts Movement, as well as poets of the Movement in Britain, saw a stiff-necked modernism&#x2014;aestheticist, elitist, writerly&#x2014;as the dominant mode needing demolition, many leading poets of the "developing world," including the Barbadian Brathwaite, Saint Lucian Walcott, Indian A. K. Ramanujan, Ugandan Okot p'Bitek, and the Nigerians Christopher Okigbo and Wole Soyinka, seized on Euromodernism as a tool of liberation. These postcolonial poets, all born in a five year span from 1929 to 1934 and thus initially educated under British colonial rule, came of age during the formal breakup of much of the British Empire from the late 1940s through the 1960s. They leveraged Euromodernism against British Romantic, Victorian, and other imperial norms calcified in their local educational and cultural establishments&#x2014;norms that resulted in the stilted, neo-Romantic poems enshrined by organizations such as the Jamaican Poetry League.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For the young Brathwaite, Eliot's impersonality and unpredictability seemed an emancipatory alternative to the closed, emotive, monologic voice of the canonical English lyric purveyed in the schools. For Ramanujan, modernist astringency served as an antidote to the mawkishness and monologism of much postwar Indian poetry in English. Though often seen as a nativist, Okot p'Bitek employed brisk, modernist free verse and defamiliarizingly literal translation to satirize the hypocrisy and pomposity of African missionaries and politicians. Against the restrictive "platform poetry" of negritude, Okigbo and Soyinka unleashed an intercultural polyphony they derived in part from modernism. The opening lyric of Walcott's <i>Collected Poems </i>redeploys the agonized self-divisions of "Prufrock," with auxiliary echoes of <i>The Waste Land</i>: "I go, 

<b></b>

of course, through all the isolated acts, / Make a holiday of situations, / Straighten my tie and fix important jaws. . . ." The modernist topos of self-alienation, far from being "metonymic of the operation of imperial domination," serves to contest the imperialist image of West Indians found "In tourist booklets, behind ardent binoculars; / Found in the blue reflection of eyes / That have known cities and think us here happy."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> The choice for Walcott, Brathwaite, Ramanujan, Okot, Okigbo, and Soyinka was not between an imported Euromodernism and a pristine native culture, since the forms of cultural dominance against which they struggled were often local instantiations of the imperium&#x2014;Victorian sentiment and monologue, missionary prudishness and hypocrisy, colonial education and racism, a tourist industry complicit in the production of imprisoning stereotypes, and nationalisms and nativisms that mirrored European norms in reverse. To insist, in the name of anti-Eurocentricity, that Euromodernism be seen as an imperial antagonist is to condescend to imaginative writers who have wielded modernism in cultural decolonization and, ironically, to impose as universal a Eurocentric standard: the antimodernism of postwar American and British poetry.  </p>

<p>The intercultural poetic forms of modernism, in particular, have been especially attractive to so-called Third World poets in their quest to break through monologic lyricism, to express their cross-cultural experience, despite vast differences in ethnicity, geography, politics, and history from the Euromodernists. Modernist bricolage&#x2014;the synthetic use in early twentieth-century poetry of diverse cultural materials ready to hand&#x2014;has helped postcolonial poets encode aesthetically the intersections among multiple cultural vectors. Writing in the metropole at a time of imperial and ethnographic adventure, massive immigration, world war, interlingual mixture, and accelerated communication and travel, the Euromodernists&#x2014;many of them exiles and &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9;s themselves&#x2014;were the first English-language poets to create a formal vocabulary for the intercultural collisions and juxtapositions, the epistemic instabilities and decenterings, of globalization.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  By contrast with the disjunctiveness and perspectivism of the modernist poem, the premodern English lyric was, Brathwaite suggests, a model that risked suppressing the cultural complexity of postcolonial experience, because it could not adequately articulate such intercultural discordance as being schooled to write poems about unseen snowfall while living in the hurricane-swept tropics.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  For many postcolonial poets, though on the receiving end of empire, more important than the modernists' complicity in a waning imperialism and in Orientalist fantasy, or their imbrication in European literary tradition, was their creation of answering forms and vocabularies for the cross-cultural juxtapositions, interreligious layerings, and polyglot interminglings of cross-hemispheric experience. </p>

<p>But while postcolonial poets emergent in the 1950s and 1960s weren't antimodernists, neither were they Euromodernist wannabes. If postcolonial criticism has often been too eager to depict postcolonial writers as revolutionary Calibans struggling heroically against hegemonic, Euromodernist Prosperos, modernist criticism has at times been perhaps too eager to assimilate postcolonialism to Euromodernism as "part of the same movement."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Yet the contrasts should not be bleached out, since Euromodernists, even if marginal to the British cultural and political center by virtue of nationality (e.g., 

<b></b>

Irish or American), class, sexual orientation, or aesthetics ("<i>&#x00E9;pater les bourgeois</i>" avant-gardism), were finally less marginal than non-European poets growing up in Castries, Bridgetown, Kingston, Mysore, Srinagar, Ojoto, Ibadan, or Gulu. Postcolonial hybridity and modernist bricolage are thus, in James Clifford's phrase, "<i>discrepant cosmopolitanisms</i>."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The conditions of possibility for postcolonial hybridity are violent occupation and cultural imposition at home, across immense differences of power, topography, culture, and economics. Its non-West is primary and profoundly experiential, not the object of extraterritorial questing via tourism and museums, books and ethnography, friendships and translations. By contrast, Euromodernists make use, as L&#x00E9;vi-Strauss says of the bricoleur, of a limited heterogeneity, their materials often made available by imperial and ethnographic forays.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Even the most boldly cross-hemispheric Euromodernist poets occasionally import a subaltern text or artifact or genre and embed it within a Western literary universe. Since the postcolonial writer inhabits the multiple cultural worlds forcibly conjoined by empire, hybridity&#x2014;the knotting together of countless already knotted together indigenous and imposed languages, images, and genres&#x2014;is not an aspect but the basic fabric of the postcolonial poem. In redeploying modernism across these differences, postcolonial poets have had to refashion it for resisting local and imperial monisms, for articulating a cross-culturalism still more plural and polyphonic than Euromodernism. They have reshaped it through indigenous genres and vocabularies, have recentered it in non-Western landscapes and mythologies, and have often inverted its racial and cultural politics. </p>

<p>Among the hybridizing literary strategies of postcolonial poetry that can be traced in part to Euromodernist bricolage are translocalism, mythical syncretism, heteroglossia, and apocalypticism. Translocalism, the mode of intercultural syncretism with which I began, is key to A. K. Ramanujan's "Chicago Zen": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Watch your step. Sight may strike<br /> you blind in unexpected places.</p>

<p>
The traffic light turns orange 

<br />on 57th and Dorchester, and you stumble,</p>

<br />

<p>
in the window.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<b></b></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">

In this morphing of Lake Michigan into a South Asian river, of the traffic light by Hyde Park into Indian forest fires, Ramanujan adapts the modernist technique of translocal "super-position," as Pound called it&#x2014;Eliot's layering of the Thames and the Ganges, Pound's of a mountain near the DTC in Pisa and Mount Taishan. He renews both Euromodernist technique and its indigenous counterpart, fusing superposition to what he termed the "montage" and "dissolve" effects of Dravidian poetry, as well as the startling paradoxes of Zen.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  As in Goodison's melding of Ireland's Sligo and Jamaica's Sligoville, Walcott's of the Greek islands and the Antilles, distances between North and South collapse: "you drown," Ramanujan writes in an echo of "Prufrock," "eyes open, // towards the Indies, the antipodes." Not that postcolonial and modernist translocalisms are identical. The Euromodernist superpositional poem imports into an experiential Western place (the Thames, Pisa) an "other," exoticized, Eastern place (the Ganges, Mount Taishan), whereas in "Chicago Zen," the speaker "falls" from one floor of his migrant experience&#x2014;Chicago&#x2014;to another&#x2014;India, two worlds that he has lived in and that now live in him. And whereas the Euromodernist poem often de-realizes the local (Eliot's London, Pound's Pisa) by silhouetting it against an Eastern alterity, Ramanujan's poem revises this modernist strategy by oscillating between fully real but discrepant locations. Ramanujan assimilates modernist translocalism to what Salman Rushdie calls the "migrant's-eye view of the world"&#x2014;born of a more fully interstitial migrancy than that of the modernists, because of its layering upon a prior postcolonial dislocation, and thus a more thoroughgoing "experience of uprooting, disjuncture and metamorphosis (slow or rapid, painful or pleasurable)."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> </p>

<p>Postcolonial poets have also adapted mythical syncretism from the modernists as a key device for their intercultural poetics: like Cuchulain, so Goodison's maroon warrior; like Shango&#x2014;Yoruba god of lightning&#x2014;so electricity in Soyinka's "Idanre." The modernists helped make the high art poem a space for the cross-religious syncretism that was basic to life in the colonies and postcolonies, so that, once again, an imported modernism paradoxically serves as a means for transmuting into literary discourse "postcolocal" experience, to propose a portmanteau word that, combining "postcolonial" with "local," also highlights the translocalism&#x2014;"colocal"&#x2014;of the postcolonial. Having in modernist fashion developed his "own personal religion," out of Christian, classical, and Igbo sources, Christopher Okigbo said in an interview "The way that I worship my gods is in fact through poetry."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Yeats also thought of poetry as a syncretic rite, and Okigbo delivers an appropriately ritualistic homage to Yeats as "the arch-priest of the sanctuary" in his "Lament of the Masks," published by the University of Ibadan in a book celebrating Yeats's centenary in 1965.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In this late poem, which has been described as marking Okigbo's shift to a more African aesthetic, Okigbo paradoxically africanizes his poetry in the act of praising a Euromodernist.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Indigenization and aesthetic modernization, for Okigbo as for Ramanujan, are not polar opposites but closely linked. Direct references within the poem to classical panegyric and to praise song indicate Okigbo's remaking of European genres within an African framework (the contributor's note also states the poem "is based on a traditional Yoruba praise-song").<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Drawing on the traditional praise song's ritualistic imagery of the hunt, animals, and 

<b></b>

heroic action, Okigbo arrays an African elephant, jungle, plaintain leaf, and giant iroko tree alongside symbols adapted from the temple of Yeats's poetry&#x2014;iron-throated singers in bird-masks&#x2014;and from classical myth&#x2014;"Waggoner of the great Dawn" ("LM,"xiii). He reterritorializes Yeats, africanizing him as an elephant hunter, his masks as ritual objects, while deterritorializing the praise song, centering it on a European subject. It is hard not to hear a wry pun on "canon" in Okigbo's modest self-representation: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

<p class="continued">Having spent much time in an "ethereal ivory tower," Yeats comes across as a perhaps too idealistic&#x2014;if tireless and heroic&#x2014;chaser of "the white elephant." Still, on balance, the relation of Okigbo's poem to Yeats's verse is more affiliative than corrosive: like Goodison, Okigbo credits Yeats with having helped to translate lived, "postcolocal," trans-religious feeling into poetry. Elsewhere, Okigbo's poetry of polymythic syncretism draws extensively on the intercultural amalgamations of Pound's poetry&#x2014;from <i>The Cantos </i>he even adapts archaisms, shifting cadences, and the refrain, especially resonant in 1960s Nigeria, "&amp; the mortar is not yet dry."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Okigbo remarked that he "never felt" a "conflict" between his European and his African cultural inheritances, and his praise song for Yeats synthesizes mythologies of Euroclassical ("rumour awakens"), Christian ("Water of baptism"), and precolonial African ("Thunder above the earth") origin ("LM,"xii, xiv).  </p>

<p>Although Walcott sometimes highlights the tensions among the various points on his religious and cultural compass (for example, the early "A Far Cry from Africa"), he, too, is often an organic syncretist, to draw on Bakhtin's distinction between "organic" and "intentional" modes of hybridity.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In an especially high-spirited scene of <i>Omeros</i> that humorously pumps up modernist comparativism, Walcott imagines a cyclone pounding Saint Lucia as a raucous party to which he invites European, African, and Caribbean gods. They play Yoruba and Afro-Caribbean "Shango drums" that "made Neptune rock in the caves," while the Haitian love goddess Erzulie rattles "her ra-ra," the Afro-Caribbean snake god Damballa winds, and the Yoruba and Afro-Caribbean blacksmith Ogun fires drinks with "his partner Zeus."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Unlike Okigbo or Soyinka, Walcott aestheticizes the transreligious, displaying his intercultural groupings as artifacts. Still, his compression of deities from diverse pantheons into one polyphonous space energizes both party and poem. Like Okigbo's, the later Walcott's syncretism 

<b></b>

tends to be more exuberant than elegiac&#x2014;a celebration of transregional inheritance in the Caribbean&#x2014;unlike Eliot's "mythical method," where the parallels often encode a narrative of degeneration, a Eurocentric lament over decline and dissipation.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  </p>

<p>More nearly affiliated with Eliot's elegiac syncretism, if still distinct, is the work of a poet of the next generation, the Kashmiri American Agha Shahid Ali. In "Ghazal" ("Where are you now? Who lies beneath your spell tonight"), the different faiths of Ali's youth jostle alongside one another, in references to Biblical stories, a Hindu temple, and a Shi'a God.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Repulsed by violence in the name of religion&#x2014;executions, smashed statues and idols&#x2014; "A refugee from Belief seeks a cell tonight," perhaps in the discontinuous two-line cells of the ghazal itself:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Executioners near the woman at the window. <br />
Damn you, Elijah, I'll bless Jezebel tonight.</p>
<p>

<i>Lord, </i>cried out the idols, <i>Don't let us be broken;  </i>
<br />
<i>Only we can convert the infidel tonight. </i>

</p>
<p>

<p>

<p>

And I, Shahid, only am escaped to tell thee&#x2014; 

<br />God sobs in my arms. Call me Ishmael tonight. <sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">In the echo chamber of this final couplet, Ali commingles Job ("only am escaped [alone] to tell thee"), <i>Moby-Dick </i>("Call me Ishmael" and the Job quotation), and Islamic tradition (Ishmael as ur-ancestor). In this further example of what I term the dialectics of indigenization, Ali reinvigorates both the "native" and the foreign, both the Urdu-Arabic-Persian form of the ghazal and the Euromodernist mode of mythical syncretism, bracing them together through their homologous conjunctures and fissures. Hardly a disabling imperial influence, modernist syncretism, ghazalified, functions for Ali as a counterweight to tyrannies closer to "home"&#x2014;the religious and nationalist absolutisms that have ravaged Kashmir. As required by the ghazal, the poet names himself (the <i>takhallos</i>), but he then gives himself another name, Ishmael&#x2014;an intercultural node in which Judaism, Christianity, and Islam intersect, as they have in the poem's formal junctures and syncretic layerings. This <i>takhallos</i> may also recall the strange fusion of self-reference and scattershot quotation in a famous retrospective coda&#x2014;"These fragments I have shored against my ruins"&#x2014;particularly in view of Ali's discussion, in his dissertation-turned-monograph, <i>T. S. Eliot as Editor</i>, of the "sense 

<b></b>

of loss and desolation" in <i>The Waste Land.</i><sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Lamenting exile, linguistic displacement, and political violence in his poems, Ali is drawn to Eliot's work by its resemblance to the melancholy of Urdu poetry, to the disjunctive collage and impersonal personality of the ghazal. Yet whereas Eliot grieves in the gaps between one version of a myth and its successors, in the instabilities and ruptures of cultural multiplicity, Ali freely moves among intimately felt inheritances from English, American, and Urdu literatures and from Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, mobilizing these against both public and private losses, and against monistic structures of recuperation from such losses. The differential appropriations of Eliot by a poet of Shi'a Muslim and of Afro-Caribbean origin&#x2014;that is the differences between Ali's Eliot and Brathwaite's satiric, jazzy, creolized Eliot&#x2014;again instance the diverse postcolonial indigenizations of modernism. For Ali, as for Brathwaite, Goodison, Okigbo, and Ramanujan, modernism represents not an "imposition of a set of largely uncontested parameters upon a non-European cultural reality," but a multifaceted and mutable resource, amenable to different localizing strategies and syntheses. </p>

<p>Modernist heteroglossia&#x2014;rapid turns from high to low, Standard to dialect, English to Sanskrit or Chinese, preeminently in Eliot and Pound&#x2014;is another form of literary bricolage submitted to the dialectics of indigenization by postcolonial poets, especially in the Caribbean. Whereas Eliot and Pound, as Michael North has shown, made ambivalent use of African American vernacular as vital yet debased, Brathwaite, Walcott, and Goodison have adopted heteroglossia as a poetic structure to re the code switching of Barbados, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia&#x2014;an everyday practice that was, nevertheless, largely absent from earlier West Indian poems, which were usually written in Creole, Standard English, or a comic medley of the two.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Although Brathwaite hears a hint of nation language in a voice recording of Claude McKay's Standard English poetry, he suggests that the English lyric had rendered largely inaudible the poet's Afro-Euro-American creolization.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  In "Calypso," a signature poem of Brathwaite's <i>Rights of Passage</i>, the first part of <i>The Arrivants</i>, his echo of <i>The Waste Land</i> makes clear the literary template for his criss-crossing voices: Black Sam "carries bucketfuls of water / 'cause his Ma's just had another daughter" (the moonlight shines on Eliot's "Mrs. Porter / And on her daughter / They wash their feet in soda water").<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Like Eliot, whose irregularly placed rhymes and shifting rhythms he redeploys, Brathwaite plays various Englishes against one another: in "Calypso," a prophetic voice intoning a creation myth of the Caribbean ("curved stone hissed into reef / wave teeth fanged into clay"); a satiric ode on white plantation life, built on Eliot's "so elegant / So intelligent" Shakespeherian rag ("O it was a wonderful time / an elegant benevolent redolent time&#x2014;"); calypso itself ("Steel drum steel drum / hit the hot calypso dancing"); and West Indian Creole ("please to take 'im back"). Brathwaite's early heteroglossia, like Eliot's, exemplifies Bakhtin's "intentional hybridity," a poetry of satiric tensions and incongruities among voices, languages, sociolects. By the time Walcott is publishing "The Schooner <i>Flight</i>" in 1977&#x2013;1979 and Lorna Goodison her first volumes of poetry in the 1980s, they, Brathwaite, and other West Indian poets are more nimbly and pervasively switching between Standard and dialectal codes, even as they have altered, abandoned, or inverted the linguistic hierarchies of modernism.

 </p>

<p>Modernist apocalypses have also served poets from different parts of the postcolonial world, and the apocalyptic is intimately tied to the intercultural in <i>The Waste Land </i>and other modernist poems, the crossing from West to East affording an extrinsic vantage point that reveals or uncovers (<i>apokalypsis</i>) the crisis of modernity. Indeed, the apocalyptic mode evinces the intense ambivalence toward modernity in both Euromodernist and postcolonial writing. At the end of "The Fire Sermon," inveighing against the West's unhinging of sex from religion, Eliot fuses the Buddha and Augustine&#x2014;"Burning burning burning burning"&#x2014;in what his note names "this collocation of these two representatives of eastern and western asceticism."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In "Irae," Brathwaite reroutes Eliot's moral apocalypse into a postcolonial confrontation with the West, intoning "burning burning from tomorrow" in an early version of the poem.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> In this instance of the dialectics of indigenization, of the transformative twinning of the Euromodernist with the postcolocal, Brathwaite fuses Eliotic and Rastafarian apocalypses, as he earlier had in the vision of Babylon burned in "Wings of a Dove." Aggressively dislocating "Dies Irae" to address contemporary circumstance&#x2014;a dislocation that also recalls Eliot's violent decontextualization of traditional material to simulate crisis&#x2014;Brathwaite pounds out a prophecy of doom in the insistent rhymes and rhythms of the thirteenth-century hymn: "dies irae dreadful day / when the world shall pass away." In two of the tercets' middle lines, he chillingly compacts the names of massacres&#x2014;"mi lai sharpville wounded knee"&#x2014;and weapons&#x2014;"poniard poison rocket bomb"&#x2014;that occasion the poem's distress and rage. The poet sees divine retribution in the violent resistance of Jamaica's Maroon leaders&#x2014;"nanny cuffee cudjoe." Brathwaite thus remakes Eliot's fiery apocalypse to condemn an imperial West that&#x2014;technologically superior but ethically insane&#x2014;is responsible for unspeakable injustices and atrocities and thus deserves its imminent implosion:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>day of fire dreadful day <br />
day for which all sufferers pray <br />
grant me patience with thy plenty <br />
grant me vengeance with thy sword <sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The political implications of Brathwaite's poem could hardly be more different from those we usually associate with Eliot's. Even so, in translating Eliot's apocalypse across the North/South divide and melding it, via a medieval hymn, with Rastafarian chant, Brathwaite renews the apocalyptic mode: like the Euromodernists, he uses religious language for a compressed, visionary evocation of modernity as cataclysmic violence, a modern history trembling on the verge of dramatic and perhaps ultimate transformation.  </p>

<p>Another poem of cosmic symbolism, including the thunder and lightning mythologized in West Africa, Christopher Okigbo's "Come Thunder" also adapts modernist apocalypticism&#x2014;especially Yeats's&#x2014;to bespeak a liminal moment in "Third World" history, the first of numerous civil wars that have ravaged postcolonial Africa. Okigbo presents as a second coming, complete with birds that seem almost Byzantine, the events leading up to the Nigerian civil war, in which he was to t and die:

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

And the secret thing in its heaving 

<br />Threatens with iron mask 
<br />

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">As in Yeats's prophecies, the violence of modernity inspires a troubled joy&#x2014;"laughter, broken in two, hangs tremulous between the teeth"&#x2014;and a joyous terror&#x2014;the threat of an unknowable, iron-masked future. Okigbo, again like Yeats, lexically achieves the apocalyptic by combining the concrete ("The smell of blood," "myriad eyes of deserted corn cobs") with the indefinite ("immeasurable," "unnamed," "unprintable"). He africanizes the affective and formal structures of the modernist apocalypse&#x2014;his title evoking also "What the Thunder Said"&#x2014;for a postcolonial vision of a rough beast about to be born. Since modernist apocalypses are thought to represent a Eurocentric response to the decline of a Western imperium, such adaptability may well seem surprising, but British poets of the 1930s, as Stephen Spender indicates, already believed that, "Considered as an apocalyptic vision, the Communist view coincides with that of T. S. Eliot in <i>The Waste Land </i>or Yeats in <i>The Second Coming.</i>"<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Postcolonial poets have been no less ready to remake Euromodernist apocalypses for their ambivalent visions of the historical rupture of modernity. </p>

<p>Having explored how "Third World" poets postcolonize Euromodernism and Euromodernize the postcolonial, I reverse the lens, reconsidering the cross-cultural bricolage of a few of the most canonical modernist poems, in view of this postcolonial reception. As I have already suggested, the North/South syncretism and trans-hemispheric interstitiality in Euromodernist poems differ from the often more thoroughly hybridized language, mythology, genres, and geography of postcolonial texts. The primary trans-hemispheric current in Euromodernist poems is the importation of East and South Asian materials. These poems invoke Asian religious texts, such as the Upanishads and the Fire Sermon, as well as literary genres or visual artifacts, such as haiku or a lapis lazuli carving, as potential solutions to Eurocentric crises of faith, war, literature, and tradition. They often exotically construct the East as spiritual Other, as site of ancient wisdom, frozen in an archaic state, voided of a contemporary history with real human beings.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  In keeping with other familiar patterns of circulation and long-lived Orientalist assumptions, the literary West, as site of artistic and epistemic production, mines and arrogates to itself raw materials imported from Asia and makes of them new elite forms of literary capital. </p>

<p>If so, how could Eliot, Yeats, and Pound furnish enabling examples for postcolonial poets? Are not the Euromodernists, as Neil Lazarus writes of such Western musicians 

<b></b>

as Paul Simon, guilty of a "profound insensitivity to the politico-ethical implications of cultural appropriation across the international division of labor," of a "distressing unilateralism of influence," a "complete lack of cultural dialogism"?<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  In an essay on <i>The Waste Land </i>and empire, Paul Douglass has argued that Pound and Eliot's "aesthetics of the jagged and the juxtaposed," the "fragmentary and syncretic," is inherently "reactionary," part of a larger project in "defense of . . . empire": such literary wreckage demands the imperial, reconstructive labor of a learned elite.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  More generally, these modernist texts are increasingly thought to belong seamlessly to the Orientalist project of fabricating, managing, and disciplining the East. But the postcolonial poetic response compels us to ask whether such views are fully adequate to the cross-cultural dimension of Euromodernist poetry, whether the manner of its assimilation of non-Western texts and artifacts&#x2014;often inorganic, incomplete, and self-conscious&#x2014;might enable these to interact dialogically with the predominantly Western texts into which they are imported. </p>

<p>In my view, because of <i>The Waste Land</i>'s and <i>The Cantos</i>' heteroglot representation of the East partly in its languages, these indigenous texts retain at least some capacity to question both their Western host texts and the ways in which the non-West is represented. In an essay on the uses of India in <i>The Waste Land</i>, Harish Trivedi argues that "for Eliot, there aren't in this poem, there never were and never would be, any solutions outside Christianity. Here, near the climax of his poem ["What the Thunder Said"], he takes up, in order to interrogate, the traditional claim of Eastern spiritual efficacy, and finds it wanting."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  But in Eliot's collage of his own poetry with the text of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the discordance between the ethical injunctions<i> Datta, Dayadhvam, Damyata </i>and the English responses shows up not the East's but the West's spiritual inefficacy, its helplessness to redress its crisis. The Sanskrit texts&#x2014;though perhaps framed like objects in the British Museum&#x2014;nevertheless write back to an empire that in the early 1920s continued to assert its superiority and mastery over these texts' site of origin. By way of an imperfect analogy, imagine if during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, John Ashbery or Jorie Graham embedded Koranic verses in their poetry as signifiers of spiritual wisdom. "Shantih     shantih     shantih," normally the closing benediction of an Upanishad, suggestively reframes <i>The Waste Land</i>, as if to say, this poem aspires to the peacefulness of an ancient, sacred, meditative text from still-colonized India, but, as perhaps indicated by Eliot's omission of the standard prefix "Om," again shows the West to fall short. Ultimately, even the poem's critique of the West, though offered in the voice of the other, can be seen as problematically appropriative, since Eliot is using Eastern materials to Western ends&#x2014;Eastern supplements that are, finally, appendages to a fundamentally Western project. But we should be wary of the na&#x00EF;ve presupposition that a poetic text could, as if released from all ethnocentric moorings, engage a text from another hemisphere without assimilative pressure, without using it for its own cultural ends. Moreover, the poem's shadowing of a non-Western religion with a Christian intertext&#x2014;Trivedi cites the translation of the poem's last line as the biblical "Peace which passeth understanding"&#x2014;is common to some of the most celebrated postcolonial works (Achebe reshapes Igbo stories to fit 

<b></b>

Christian paradigms in <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, and Okigbo returns in <i>Heavensgate </i>to Igbo myth and culture through the story of the prodigal son).<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  While Christian yearning plays a part in <i>The Waste Land</i>, to read back into the poem the logic of the salvific Christianity Eliot later embraced is to allow this telos to evacuate the melancholic specificity, the painful splaying across hemispheres, of this literary moment. We do violence to its intercultural dialogism and disjuncture, its textual "fragments" and personal "ruins," if we overemphasize the recuperative clause wedged between these two substantives&#x2014;"I have shored against." <i>The Waste Land</i>, while not escaping the Orientalism of modern Western representations of the East, also sets Eastern and Western texts in dialogic relation with one another, and in this double-voicedness, in the seams between the pieces of the trans-hemispheric collage, in the cross-cultural slippage between text and embedded text, the Eastern quotations retain at least some capacity to make themselves heard. </p>

<p>Yeats's "Lapis Lazuli" also both participates in and questions Orientalist assimilation, exoticism, and supplementarity. Like <i>The Waste Land</i>, the poem enacts a psycho-geographical movement from a Western panorama of destruction to an Eastern alterity. Here again, the onset of large-scale terror and destruction occasions the poet's cross-cultural excursion to the Orient, where Yeats stages the last in a series of rejoinders to the view that artistic gaiety is frivolous in wartime&#x2014;fiddling while the metropole burns. Edmund Dulac had written Yeats that he feared London would be bombed, and in 1936, Hitler, Mussolini, and Spanish generals were indeed mobilizing for war. The eighteenth-century Chinese carving, arrived at in the poem after a typically modernist leap across hemispheres, seems at first to offer an exotic refuge:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>Two Chinamen, behind them a third, <br />
Are carved in Lapis Lazuli, <br />
Over them flies a long-legged bird <br />
A symbol of longevity; <br />
The third, doubtless a serving-man, <br />
Carries a musical instrument.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">After the scenes of death and ruin in the earlier stanzas, the calm enumeration of hierarchical social roles, twinned with signifiers of hermeneutic certainty (the bird "A symbol of longevity"), suggests a timeless, Oriental world of order, harmony, and stability. But in the ensuing lines, East/West binaries begin to collapse, as time and ruin invade the scene: "Every discolouration of the stone, / Every accidental crack or dent. . ." (ibid.). If the poet has tried to displace Western war and chaos with an atemporal, Eastern security, the carving's surface fissures this Orientalist presumption. Although Yeats's poem is not, like Eliot's, heteroglot, his modernist close reading of the artifact enables its surface to assert a reality that contravenes the Orientalist abstractions with which he began: the poem self-correctively pivots, undoing its reified image of the Chinese stone. Here, as in Eliot's poem, this slippage, though limited, creates a space for a counterdiscourse to be heard: the East is not the timeless haven the poet hoped for.  </p>

<p>But no sooner has Yeats established the stone's fractured surface as primary than he begins to project onto it his poetic fantasies, troping each mark as 

<b></b>

 </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>. . . a water-course or an avalanche, <br />
Or lofty slope where it still snows <br />
Though doubtless plum or cherry-branch <br />
Sweetens the little half-way house <br />
Those Chinamen climb towards, and I <br />
Delight to imagine them seated there. . . . [ibid.]</p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">His poetic self-consciousness foregrounded by the second use of "doubtless" and the enjambment that suspends the lyric "I" at the end of a line, the poet shows us a Western mind at the moment of its interplay with an Eastern artifact, of inspiration by and transformation of Chinese art into something other than itself. Although these lines belong to the discourse, in Edward Said's words, "by which European culture was able to manage&#x2014;and even produce&#x2014;the Orient," they also open a reflective space within that discourse, because they thematize the literary work of producing the Orient.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Instancing the imaginative joy of building again out of things that fall, the poet indulges Orientalist fantasy, writing over the stone's surface with stock plum- or cherry-branches and an imagined trek half way up the mountain. Yet set off by the stone's corrective, his construction of a self-affirming Western lyric moment out of the fissures and interstices of an Eastern artwork is shown to supplement, twist, and distort. While the poem assimilates the Chinese Other to Nietzschean tragic joy, and while the poet is returned to himself through the wrinkle-eyed gaze of the other, this assimilation also impedes itself; after all, the poet needs the other to remain at least somewhat other, if only so that he can use the Orient as an alternative space from which to look back critically at the anguish and terror gripping the contemporary Occident. That he imagines the Chinamen climbing not to a transcendental site atop the mountain but to a halfway house res their in-betweenness as part-Chinamen, part-ents of a Western imagination. Indeed, in a letter about the carving, Yeats similarly interrupts himself, unable to decide whether to write about the East as Other or as assimilable to Western tragedy: "The heroic cry in the midst of despair. But no, I am wrong, the east has its solutions always and therefore knows nothing of tragedy."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Self-interrupting, self-thematizing, the poem foregrounds what we might call the Orientalist wobble, caught as it is between assimilation and acknowledgment, between exoticism and historicity. </p>

<p>Another key poem in the Euromodernist canon, Pound's "In a Station of the Metro" also crosses from West to East, but dramatically miniaturizes the journey: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>The apparition of these faces in the crowd; <br />
Petals on a wet, black bough.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">The poem's imaginative leap&#x2014;often celebrated for its modernist compression and ellipsis&#x2014;is again transhemispheric, from an urban Western scene, specifically located by the title in a Parisian Metro station, to an unmistakably East Asian, painterly image of flower petals against a branch. In his well-known account of composing the poem, Pound writes of "trying to record the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself, or darts into a thing inward and subjective."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  His implicit association

<b></b>

 of the East with the "inward and subjective," as contrasted with the historicized, materialized objectivity of the urban crowd scene, accords with the Orientalist abstraction of the East as spiritual and immaterial that we also saw in <i>The Waste Land </i>and in "Lapis Lazuli." Also like Eliot and Yeats, Pound turns to Asia in a moment of crisis or, in his own word, "impasse," seizing on Japanese haiku as a literary model that enables his breakthrough&#x2014;a mirror-image of the later postcolonial importation of Euromodernism to shatter the impasse of a colonial poetics. Pound famously recounts how he reduced the poem from thirty lines to two under the influence of the compression and "super-position" of haiku, suggesting that an Asian literary structure helped engender the starkly juxtapositional poetics of modernism and, insofar as this is an intercultural formation, again complicating the view that such jaggedness is inherently imperialist.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  With its title seen as integral, the poem is still more closely linked to the three-line structure of haiku (short to long to short line).<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Pound's prototypically Imagist poem thus encrypts and enacts within its split, trans-hemispheric textual body a miniaturized psycho-biographical narrative of its genesis out of a cross-cultural imaginative passage from West to East. By at once internalizing and displaying the logic of its East-West dislocation, by refusing connectives that would discursively paper over the gap between the Western urban scene and Eastern ideality, by formally alluding to the three-line haiku without flattening its differences from this generic paradigm, the poem represents an Orientalism that is also anti-Orientalist, that is cross-cutting and counterdiscursive. Pound's later free translations of <i>Cathay </i>will&#x2014;through the use of Japanese for Chinese names of places and poets&#x2014;also foreground a densely mediated reception history that similarly impedes, even as other features of the texts advance, Orientalist transparency and penetration. </p>

<p>In sum, these three poems exemplify Orientalist appropriation, exoticism, and misreading, but the intercultural crossings they enact are also self-divided, self-impeding, and self-critical. While inserting a non-Western text, artifact, image, or genre into an Orientalist discourse, they also make audible the friction between re and frame, foreground the wobble of assimilation or alterity. Monologic imperialism is thus inadequate as a description of their intercultural work&#x2014;their jagged cross-cultural juxtapositions, their dialogic counterpointing of here and there, their leveraging of the East in their critique of the West, ultimately their openness, if only partial, to the potentially transformative impact of the voice of the other. </p>

<p>A later generation of poets on the margins of empire can thus help us reconsider what we think we know about modernist poetry. Not that the modernists in their own time are identical with their subsequent reception. The postcolonial uncovering of generative potentiality in modernism does not literally change the historical reality of the poets' words or actions. By the same token, Pound's profound influence on the second-generation Jewish modernists&#x2014;the Objectivists Reznikoff, Zukofsky, and Oppen&#x2014;does not make some of his poetry any less virulently anti-Semitic. Nevertheless, that later poets have been able to read the poetry of Eliot, Yeats, and Pound against the grain of its limitations should indeed shape our understanding of the potential of Euromodernist aesthetics. Eliot's uses of Donne's forced, cerebral conjunctions; Yeats's 

<b></b>

transmutation of Shelley's and Blake's visionary poetics; Langston Hughes's and Sterling Brown's adaptations of Whitman's omnivorous personae&#x2014;in such cases, the transumption releases and revitalizes aspects of a precursor's work. "The words of a dead man," in Auden's aphorism, "Are modified in the guts of the living."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  The Language poets, as Marjorie Perloff has argued, take up and expand certain features of modernist poetry that make us see it anew&#x2014;constructivism, anti-absorptive artifice, the poetics of adjacency and surface fragmentation.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  This modernism is by and large the reverse of the witty, paradoxical, ironic modernism that the mid-century American formalists&#x2014;the early Robert Lowell and Richard Wilbur&#x2014;made the foundation of their poetry. In what we might term the postcolonial metaleptic, modernism's relation to postcolonial poetry illuminates yet other features&#x2014;translocalism, polymythic syncretism, heteroglossia, ambivalent modernity, apocalypticism, interstitial migrancy, cultural self-alienation and self-critique and dialogism&#x2014;that otherwise might risk being obscured. </p>

<p>Literary modernism is often praised or blamed for its cross-cultural appropriations, with scant awareness of its postcolonial afterlives&#x2014;Goodison's swapping duppy stories with Yeats, Brathwaite's hearing his own Creole rhythms in Eliot's poetry, Okigbo's africanizing of Yeats's masks and of Pound's cross-religious syncretism, Ali's use of modernist disjunctiveness and melancholy to translate the ghazal. But these afterlives are vital in reconceptualizing the cross-cultural forms and languages of modernism, while dialectically yielding new insight into the still more vividly cross-cultural poetries beyond the Euro-American metropole. In an important essay, Ramanujan cites Eliot's famous description of European texts as forming " 'a simultaneous order,' where every new text within a series confirms yet alters the whole order ever so slightly, and not always so slightly."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Indigenizing and pluralizing Eliot's theory of literary tradition, he argues that Indian texts reflect and refract, invert and subvert one another, that in India "a whole tradition may invert, negate, rework, and revalue another." The same holds for the relation of his own and other postcolonial poets' work to Euromodernism: postcolonial hybridity "confirms yet alters," reworks yet revalues modernist bricolage. It thus re-begets a poetic mode that helped beget it. Only by breaking out of exclusionary models of tradition as either Eliot's "mind of Europe" or its postcolonial obverse ("an autonomous entity separate and apart from all other literatures") can we begin to grasp the continuous remaking of "traditions" by one another across the twentieth century and beyond, the mutually transformative relations between the poetries of metropole and margin. </p>
