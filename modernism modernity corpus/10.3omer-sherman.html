<p>
Since first publishing my essay, "'It is I who have been defending
a religion called Judaism': the T.S. Eliot and Horace M. Kallen
Correspondence" , I have grown even more convinced that Eliot's
relation to both living Jews and Judaism as a cultural entity within
the West was far more complex than what Anthony Julius presents in
<i>T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism and Literary Form</i> .
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
At the time, I sought to challenge what I then regarded (and still do)
as Julius's tendentious and overdetermined insistence not only that
Eliot's strongest poetry is sustained by deep currents of anti-Semitism
but that he never recanted from the ideology apparently reflected in that
work. Though I admired many aspects of Julius's superb close readings
and appreciated his cogent exploration of the nexus of fascism and
literary modernism, I couldn't help but notice that Julius's argument
for a career based on an aesthetic of "energetic ill will" was based
on very early works such as "Sweeney," and "Burbank" (<i>EAL,</i>
138). By neglecting much of the poet's greater achievements, Julius
insisted that an anti-Semitic ethos was at the foundation of the most
important work. In spite of being deeply hurt by the cruel imagery as
a young reader of Eliot's early poetry, I have long been impressed by
the critical arguments championed by Peter Ackroyd and others that the
poet's conversion to Anglicanism engendered a significant break with
his anti-Semitic animus.
<p>
Though long suspecting that Eliot was something more than an unrepentant
fascist and anti-Semite, I had always found the evidence of this debate
(on either side) a bit thin. Imagine my surprise when just a few weeks
after laying Julius's book aside,

<b></b>

while conducting research on American Zionism at the American Jewish
Archives in Cincinnati, I discovered the yellowed but well-preserved
sheets of correspondence between T.S. Eliot and Horace M. Kallen,
a Jewish American philosopher, sociologist, and Zionist polemicist
who was a prolific and widely read author; these pages quite literally
spilled onto my lap. It was an eerie experience to realize I held in my
hands the original documents, and it obviously took quite a bit longer to
determine what it all added up to. In many ways, I have been reflecting
on that moment ever since.
<p>
By the end of the day, I knew I was studying documents that (especially
in the enduring absence of any published correspondence after the year
1922) had the potential for greatly raising the stakes and enhancing the
scope of the often shrill debate over Eliot's anti-Semitism, to which
Julius was only the most recent contributor. Over the next few days, I
noted that the correspondence, which extended from 1927 (and according to
Ronald Schuchard there are probably missing letters from much earlier)
through at least 1960, encompassed two exciting threads. Besides the
fact that the letters reveal the evolution of Eliot's surprisingly
nuanced thinking about cultural difference and multiculturalism in the
post-Holocaust years, they also contain a lively exchange about the
role of secularism in American culture. These are the issues that form
the previously unknown and exciting parameters of what Eliot actually
thought about the subject of diversity&#8212;and the position of Jews
in Western culture.
<p>
Perhaps I should begin with the implications of the most charged phrase
of what was often a lively debate, when Eliot candidly concluded after
many years of engaging with Kallen's thought that: "It is I who have
been defending a religion called Judaism." Just what did Eliot mean by
that unlikely formulation? To understand that, we need to come to terms
with his interlocutor's own struggle to define the relevance of Jewish
civilization to modernity. Born in 1882 in Berenstadt, a village in the
German province of Silesia, Kallen arrived in the United States at the age
of five when his father became the rabbi of an Orthodox congregation in
Boston. For years the father and the secular-leaning son were estranged
and at Harvard, Kallen formed paternal attachments to men such as George
Santayana, Barrett Wendell, and William James. While an entering freshman,
Kallen's feelings toward Judaism and his own Jewishness were largely
negative; however, James influenced him to think about the problem of
difference in culture and Wendell encouraged him to think about the
powerful currents of Hebraic elements in American literary, political,
and social thought. Although Kallen remained antagonistic toward the
Jewish religion, he spent decades as a committed advocate for an ethnic
identity based on Jewish secularism, Zionism, and Jewish culture.
<p>
It may startle many readers to know that by 1915 Kallen had already
coined the term "cultural pluralism" as a direct challenge to both
nativism and the prevailing paradigm of the melting pot ethos, blazing
the trail for the charged cultural debates of the late twentieth century
and beyond. For Kallen, American society was to be bound together in an
"orchestration" (a key Kallen trope) of difference, a vibrant federation
of ethnic groups. He seems to have arrived at this point in "Judaism,
Hebraism, Zionism," a 1932 essay, through thinking about how the long
ages of Jewish marginality might contribute to a dynamic way of thinking
about American democracy:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Culture . . . constitutes a harmony, of which peoples and nations are
the producing instruments, to which each contributes its unique tone,
in which the whole human past is present as an enduring tension, as a
background from which the present comes to light and draws its character,
color, vitality.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A decade later he had refined the idea with sufficient lucidity to
demonstrate that the proliferation of diversities within America which
troubled so many was actually the mortar that would cement the nation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The American way of life may be said to flow from each man's inalienable
right to be different. . . . The consummation is Cultural Pluralism. For
its diverse and ever-diversifying members are united with one another
in and through their differences, and the singularity of our culture
is the orchestration of those manifold differences&#8212;e pluribus
unum&#8212;into the common faith.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Kallen's liberal reading of the motto "e pluribus unum" boldly
asserts the necessity of including the hyphenated individual in the
American union. As Stephen Whitfield observes, in this legitimization of
ethnic difference, "the individual could be anchored in a continuous
and comforting fabric of institutions that enriched the larger
community. Kallen was the pioneer theorist of resistance to the ideal
of homogenization."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
It has often been remarked that every anti-Semite has his pet
Jew. Over the years, the venomous Pound (whose unquestionably political
anti-Semitism I would never deny) cultivated a number of individual
literary Jews, from Louis Zukofskyto Allen Ginsberg, especially those
he felt had in some way repudiated or radically distanced themselves
from their Judaism. But this is certainly not the case with Eliot, as
Ronald Schuchard recently demonstrated in these pages, drawing from my
own earlier analysis. There is no more compelling instance of Eliot's
compassionate humanism than the evidence these letters contain of
Eliot's concern for Jewish refugees and his activism on their behalf
(which included meetings with Jewish philanthropists) during World
War II. In later years, though he was often severely challenged by
Kallen's radical secularism&#8212;as when the latter sent Eliot a
copy of his 1954 tome <i>Secularism is the Will of God: An Essay in
the Social Philosophy of Democracy and Religion</i>&#8212;the tone of
the correspondence remains highly collegial as if the two were engaged
on a journey of mutual inquiry. For instance, in response to Kallen's
statement that "It is the will of God that religion and ecclesiastical
affairs should not enter into the functions of the state, especially
into Public education," Eliot responded by asking "what meaning"
Kallen attached to "God" (18 March 1955). Less than two weeks later,
musing on the conflict between sharply conflicting belief systems in a
modern democracy, he gently remarked that "the line dividing tolerance
from indifference, and the line dividing faith from bigotry, may be so
fine as to be almost invisible" (2 April 1955). But Eliot was also an
admirer of the Jewish American's <i>The Book of Job as a Greek Tragedy</i>
where Kallen argued that "God" was little more than "the social soul of
which the institutions of society&#8212;economic, political, aesthetic
and ritual&#8212;are the body. As psychologists know, for every change
in the body there is a corresponding alteration of

<b></b>

soul. The idea of divinity therefore has a history which may be considered
as a function of the history of the society that entertains the idea."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
It is clear that both men were painstakingly articulating their beliefs in
relation to the genocide and destruction of the previous decade. Hence,
in Kallen's thinking, the secular contract was a "sacred" guarantee of
peace and tolerance between divergent religious groups, and he once told
Eliot that "the chief point of divergence between us is that while I
acquiesce in the right of others to their supernaturalism, I do not give
it a privileged position" (10 November 1955). Secularism would prevent any
one religion from oppressing minority faiths. For his part, Eliot never
lost an opportunity to stress the role of religion in culture, even as he
distanced himself from his once monolithic espousal of Christianity. In
a letter written in November 1955, he argues against Kallen's model of
ethnicity or race to affirm religion's primacy in civilization: "what I
call culture seems to me more important than race. . . . A culture can,
to all appearance, survive for some time the religion without which it
would not have arisen: but I do not believe that it can continue forever
if the religion dies."
<p>
On Christmas day in 1955, Eliot wrote to Kallen in America,
expressing his eagerness to get hold of a copy of Will Herberg's
<i>Protestant-Catholic-Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology,</i>
a pioneering work that articulated what then appeared as a bold
affirmation of pluralism by arguing for an "American Religion"
based on the fundamental subdivisions of Judaism, Protestantism,
and Catholicism. Eliot admired the Jewish writer's attention to the
"plight" of modern secular humanity; namely the paradox that postwar
America was at once intensely materialistic and engaged in a national
religious revival dependent on its "triple melting pot" and even seems
to have drawn from Herberg's sense that a political culture devoid of
religious beliefs and institutions presented an existential threat to
Jewish life in his incessant debates with Kallen.
<p>
In his later years, Eliot (notorious for severing long-term relationships
on the pretext of the merest perceived slights), whose enduring friendship
with Kallen included social and professional visits to the latter's New
School, seemed to have grown increasingly anxious about offending Jews
who increasingly sought to engage him in epistolary dialogue, and he
often recounted his exchanges with strangers to Kallen. On more than one
occasion in the mid-1950s he states his fervent desire that the "Jewish
faith survive," and in the shadowy aftermath of the European barbarity, he
wrote to one Dr. Harry Cohen, "I believe that the contribution which Jews
have made in the Western world has been, in modern times, in proportion
to the degree of development of the culture of the country in which Jews
are found . . . the more developed the civilization of a country, the
larger has been the Jewish contribution" (10 November 1955). The point,
of course, is not whether this was a staggeringly original observation
(it wasn't), but rather, Eliot's comment reveals not only that he had
clearly reached a point where he thought tensions between Jews and
Christians were damaging to civilization as a whole but also that he
affirmed a unique role for Judaism as a dynamic faith bestowing its
wisdom to the West. Precisely because of this conviction he remained
opposed to what he saw as Kallen's reductive advocacy of the ephemera
of Jewish culture, so that

<b></b>

at a typical impasse he declared to the Jewish psychologist, "You know it
seems to me that you have been defending a religion called the American
Idea and that it is I who am defending a religion called Judaism"
(2 April 1955)&#8212;a point that Kallen never contested. But the
minutiae of these exchanges is not nearly as important as the evidence
they provide for what has long been an attractive, if not sufficiently
substantiated, sense among many critics that throughout the 1950s Eliot
was making progress in shifting from a once-cherished ideal of cultural
homogeneity toward the kind of diversity espoused decades earlier
by his teachers William James and John Dewey. Richard Shusterman is
representative of this argument which began to emerge in the late 1980s,
observing that Eliot came to recognize that "diversity and disagreement
are not necessarily evils that must be overcome. They can provide a more
satisfying variety and richness of experience, and can moreover serve
as a productive tension to stimulate thought and progress."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Interestingly, the rabbis, of various denominations, with whom I have
shared these findings, have concurred with Eliot that the uncritical
embrace of "ethnicity" has only exacerbated the unmooring of Jews from
their religion. Kallen had spent so many years advocating a secular
Zionism that he grew to be callously dismissive of both Reform and
Orthodox belief.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
In the present moment, "ethnicity" (even when it is wedded to a
political ideology like Zionism) seems a fragile vessel to contain the
rich totality of the Jewish prophetic tradition. As Stephen Whitfield
observes, in the early generations of Jewish American culture,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the associational patterns, the bonds of intimacy in workplace and
neighborhood, the direct links to the Old World&#8212;all were strong
enough to honor the claims of ethnicity, in the absence of religion. . . secure enough to keep intact a community from which a culture
could emerge. By the end of the century, however, that identity has
destabilized, so that the boundaries between Jews and others have mostly
been obliterated.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
When one imagines the fate of an American Judaism without the vicarious
anchors of Zionism and the Holocaust, Eliot's long view of the more
sustaining values of religious life seems compellingly prescient.
<p>
Eight years after first encountering this startling correspondence, I
remain impressed by both the duration and affectionate nature of Eliot
and Kallen's unusual friendship. To encounter Eliot's writing lengthy
letters to his Jewish friend, even on Christmas day, and more often
than not signed "affectionately"; or Kallen's concluding of his with
Hebrew inscriptions such as <i>Shalom u'vracha</i> ("Peace and Blessings
Upon You") and, during one of Eliot's late illnesses, <i>Hazak</i>
(God's command to Joshua, "Strengthen Thyself") is to witness striking
evidence of their bond. But I am more impressed by what the letters tell
us about the transformation of the writer who, in the infamous <i>After
Strange Gods</i> (later condemned by the poet himself as the work of
"a very sick man" [1934]), had denounced "free-thinking Jews." Eliot's
refusal to be ingratiating is

<b></b>

perhaps the greatest evidence of his sincere engagement with Kallen's
Jewish identity. Like Julius and many others, I deeply regret that Eliot
never took a public opportunity to clarify matters or to repudiate what
some rightly regard as deeply wounding imagery. I have not been arguing
that these letters provide definitive proof of anything more than that
Eliot had a more inquiring and receptive mind than his most hostile
critics seem willing to acknowledge, and that he grew to be quite at ease
in accepting the likely prospect of enduring cultural differences. But
it remains quite possible that one day something odious will spill onto
someone else's lap in a musty archive that will overturn much of what I
have been arguing. In this regard, I will confess to feeling particularly
uneasy about Valerie Eliot's apparent reluctance to publish any of her
husband's correspondence. She has been coldly indifferent to the urgent
pleas for access to this material made by numerous Eliot scholars who
have dedicated long careers to creating a more complete portrait of the
poet's intellectual life, and one has to wonder why. For many long months,
she refused me permission to publish any portion of what I had discovered,
even though I demonstrated to her just how favorable the contents of the
Eliot-Kallen correspondence was to her husband's legacy. (I only received
permission to quote directly after the enthusiastic intercession of the
poet Seamus Heaney who immediately recognized the value of the letters
and graciously prevailed on his contacts at Faber and Faber.) Still, the
letters tell me this at the very least; that throughout his adult life,
Eliot was a thoughtful and sensitive correspondent with a Jewish-American
intellectual who held pronouncedly different views and that he was
a modest enough man to allow the latter's thoughts to enlarge his
own. These letters offer eloquent testimony to the evolution of the
poet's consciousness and his apparent determination to come to terms
with Jews&#8212;and Judaism as a living tradition.

Struggling to articulate a solid, poised identity out of the centuries of
fragmentation and exile, Kallen consistently argued that Reform Judaism
was too "detached from Jewish life," whereas traditional faith was overly
reliant on "a supernaturalism [that] cannot maintain itself against a
practical intelligence which wrests her secrets from nature." Advocating
"Hebraism" over the "Judaistic" religion, he insisted that the latter must
be replaced with the "animating ideal" of Zionism which would reintegrate
secular, cultural, and communal forms. See <i>Judaism at Bay,</i> 74, 77.
