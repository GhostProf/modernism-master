<p>
Mass culture as an interlocking complex of technologically sophisticated
and increasingly international media and entertainment industries (among
others, newspapers, popular magazines, bestsellers, professional sports,
film, fashion, advertising, and the like) emerged in Europe and America
during the two decades prior to the First World War.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Highly responsive to this development, Futurism played a significant,
 creative role within mass culture not only in Italy but across Europe,
 a role that was noted by astute contemporaries and has more recently
 been explored by scholars such as Claudia Salaris.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In general, however, Futurism's interaction with the new mass-culture
 industries has been slighted in favor of concentration on Futurism's
 relations with Fascism (Futurism as proto-Fascism, as a movement within
 early Fascism, as the shaper of Fascist ideals of war, virility,
 and misogyny). While no one would dispute Futurism's importance
 for the understanding of Fascism, such concentration has relegated
 Futurism to the status of an independent variable and led to serious
 distortions. Few would deny, for example, that Futurism strongly
 apppealed to masculinist ideals and frequently asserted a misogynism
 later appropriated by Fascism. Yet from its beginning Futurism also
 held a strong attraction for women anxious to escape the confines of
 traditional roles, an interest that further increased during World War
 I as the rapid social changes it imposed created new opportunities and
 expectations for women. That attraction, I shall argue, may have much
 to do with Futurism's involvement



<B></B>



with mass culture, a conjunction that (despite increasing recognition
that mass culture was gendered as feminine from its inception) has been
little explored and that seriously complicates our current understanding
of Futurism's gender politics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Similarly, stress on Futurism's relations with Fascism has led to
 emphasis on their common rhetoric, an idiom characterized by its
 affiliations with a new, non-static, non-traditional, "modernist" type
 of nationalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Yet such rhetoric was peripheral to Futurism's main thrust, except
 during the nine months prior to Italy's entry into the war in May 1915.

<P>
More fundamental to its prewar history were its erotic and
mass-entertainment dimensions. Despite its nationalist rhetoric, Futurism
was internationalist in practice, since it understood itself as part of
an emerging global culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 To claim that Futurism was enmeshed in the emergence of mass culture
 and yet also modernist may seem contradictory. But, as scholarship
 has increasingly called attention to the divergences among European
 modernisms and as their connections with capitalism and consumerism
 have been more fully appreciated, it has become apparent that the old
 paradigm of "modernism vs. the culture industry" will no longer do.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 My primary aims in this paper are to clarify the nature of Futurism's
 relations with both modernism and mass culture, to consider some of the
 implications this has for our understanding of Futurism and gender, and
 to show how F. T. Marinetti and other Futurists understood the reshaping
 of the artistic vocation in the face of a mass society of consumerism.

1. Modernism, Mass Culture, and Futurism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
As Andreas Huyssen argued in his pathbreaking work of the 1980s, the
notion that modernism and mass culture arose in hostile opposition to
one another has proven "amazingly resilient," in part owing to its close
association with two canonical theories of modernism, those of Theodor
Adorno and Clement Greenberg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In this context, modernism refers to intellectual efforts to secure the
 work of art as an autonomous realm in the Kantian sense by stressing
 self-referential, ironic, and experimental means and by eschewing
 not only a moral role for art but even a mimetic or representational
 one. While such an art becomes possible historically only with the
 separation of art from its traditional moorings in religion and the
 patronage system, and their replacement by a secularized art market,
 its practitioners resolutely resist any "contamination" by mass culture
 and entertainment.

<P>
Although Huyssen offered some qualification to the Adorno-Greenberg
model, he accepted the "great divide" between "high" modernism and
"low" mass culture as an accurate historical description of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth-century world. Where he innovated was
in his suggestion that we sharply distinguish between modernism and
avant-gardes such as Futurism, dadaism, constructivism, and surrealism,
since, according to the model he appropriated from Peter B&uuml;rger,
modernism is committed to the autonomy of art while the avant-gardes
are concerned with the aestheticization of life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Such an aestheticization or merging of art and life attacks the bourgeois
 institution of art, which continues to regard art as a transcendent
 or sacral



<B></B>



sphere above mundane everydayness. Avant-gardism breaks down barriers
between pure and applied art, draws mass-cultural elements from
advertising and newspapers into art, and insists on performing art in
a public sphere where the enunciated poetic word functions to incite
action, much like a speech at a political rally.

<P>
Unlike modernism, then, avant-gardes for Huyssen were not necessarily
hostile to mass culture; indeed, they not uncommonly pursued a "perhaps
deluded dream of an avant-gardist mass culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Because mass culture broke with the contemplative model of art
 and relentlessly stripped art of its aura, it could be useful in
 furthering the aestheticization of life. In making this move, however,
 avant-gardes were breaking with modernism and embracing the other side
 of the "great divide." Thus the aestheticization of life, according
 to Huyssen, did not mean overcoming the opposition of high and low but
 simply casting the avant-garde's lot with the latter. The possibility
 that the avant-garde might remain modernist in important ways and yet
 also embrace mass culture was not considered, presumably because it
 was regarded as contradictory and implausible.

<P>
As we will see, however, there are some important respects in which
Italian Futurism continues to pursue a modernist aesthetic, while
simultaneously embracing mass culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In part, this is because it continues to insist on autonomy--both in
 the sense that it resists reducing the value of art to market valuation
 and in the sense that it embraces the classic features of a modernist
 aesthetic such as irony and rejection of mimesis. Futurism, we will
 see, is best grasped not with the three-term model of modernism,
 avant-garde, and mass culture, but with a four-term model that also
 includes sacralized bourgeois culture. As Lawrence Levine has shown
 for turn-of-the-century America, the rise of mass culture had as one
 of its concomitants a stiffening of "cultural hierarchy" along the
 high/low lines of the "great divide," and I would argue that a similar
 phenomenon is quite evident in Europe, certainly in Giolittian Italy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Futurism, then, must be approached not as an avant-garde that fled
 modernism for the "perhaps deluded dream of an avant-gardist mass
 culture," but as an avant-garde--the first avant-garde, in fact--which
 sought to fuse mass culture with modernism in a challenge to sacralized
 bourgeois culture.

<P>
Such an approach must also deal with two further theoretical
complications. First, if avant-gardes like Futurism work within mass
culture, which is itself gendered female, how do we account for
its masculinist rhetoric? Huyssen's book made both points without
acknowledging the tension between them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 One might try to resolve it by claiming that the Futurists hoped
 to masculinize mass culture, but even then one would have to make
 theoretical sense of the palpable fact that Futurism was a project
 which excited both men and women; even if we suppose that Marinetti
 wanted to make Futurism an all-male club, he was increasingly unable
 to do so. Secondly, Futurism as an avant-garde project must be
 historicized. Much of the literature on avant-gardism, particularly
 that which slights Italian Futurism in favor of its Franco-Germanic and
 Russian successors, associates it entirely with the politically turbulent
 atmosphere of the war and immediate postwar years and, therefore, with
 the notion of a revolutionary reconstitution of modern culture. Futurism
 certainly participated



<B></B>



in this atmosphere, above all in the year and a half that stretched from
the end of the war to its scission with the Fascists at the second Fascist
Congress of May 1920. But Futurism's six prewar years, in many respects
its most creative, were not concerned with revolutionary dreams. While
it did then hope to undermine or even destroy sacralized bourgeois
culture--which, as a set of values, styles, and cultural institutions,
it regarded as a relic of the past and out of touch with modernity--it
worked entirely within the framework of rising consumerist capitalism
and confined itself to reorienting the mass culture associated with that
capitalism under its own leadership. In short, it opposed high-bourgeois
culture but not the principles of capitalism or even the hegemony of
the bourgeoisie in the capitalist order.

<P>

2. Futurism, Modernity, and the Market
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Futurism was the first artistic movement to respond aggressively to mass
culture rather than to retreat from it, as French symbolism had. In moving
beyond the symbolist posture of his journal <I>Poesia </I>(1905-1909)
and launching Futurism, Marinetti not only intuited the compression and
commodification of space and time that recent theorists have seen as
central to modernism, but he also understood that a generalized concept
of modernity or "the future" was possible precisely on this basis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Indeed, the Futurist reduction of modernity to the phenomenon of speed
 <I>(velocit&agrave;) </I>probably communicated the basic rationale for
 a modernist art more clearly than did any other modernist movement.

<P>
Marinetti's achievement becomes fully apparent, however, only when one
considers the range of interconnections he made between his Futurism and
the conditions of modern life. He understood the emerging power of the
press and advertising and, thus, the need for the artist/intellectual to
use these means for his own ends--a task he himself undertook on virtually
a daily basis with every media tool he could devise. More generally, he
understood that modern civilization is based on the dominance of vision,
and that visual images would not only increasingly replace written forms
but also reorient print media by heightening the visual dimensions of
their typography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 He understood how the commodified image implied the need to reconstruct
 one's own personality as a set of masks and poses (from our perspective,
 Marinetti might well be called the first Madonna). He understood that
 the spectacle of modern life was based on a marketplace whose dimensions
 were not bounded by the local community, the city, or even the nation,
 but were genuinely global. He understood that modern society as a
 "mass" society was inevitably bound up with the concept of cultural
 democratization. That is why, even though he rejected parliamentary
 forms, he always insisted on the concept of democracy when discussing
 Futurism's cultural politics, which were relentlessly antimonarchical,
 anticlerical, and anticlassical.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 He was contemptuous of intellectual movements that failed to
 appreciate the need to join what you cannot beat and that pursued
 <I>recherch&eacute; </I>language as a way of establishing an
 &eacute;litist niche. He cultivated poetry--the most antibourgeois of
 the literary arts, according to Bourdieu--but insisted on separating it



<B></B>



radically from psychic interiors and presenting it accessibly in forms
that anticipated those of modern advertising.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 In the latter regard, he paid especially close attention to the design
 of book covers <I>(copertine), </I>and he and his Futurist friends used
 many abbreviations and insignia drawn from the world of consumerism
 in their poetry and painting. Similarly, in his building designs, the
 Futurist architect Antonio Sant'Elia always included spaces specially
 designed for lighted advertising, and artists like Umberto Boccioni and
 Fortunato Depero did designs for the Touring Club of Italy and Campari.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Finally, the innovations Marinetti and the Futurists produced in
 the areas of literature, painting, film, and theater were frequently
 linked to the newer mass entertainment venues such as variety theater
 and cabaret; only exceptionally did they make a primary appeal to the
 traditional, high-culture-oriented &eacute;lite.

<P>
Of course, none of this attention to mass-cultural forms guaranteed
commercial success, and there were undoubtedly occasions when the
Futurists failed to exploit the full potential of the new media and
venues in which they were working.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The difficult question to answer in this regard is whether such failures
 resulted primarily from an inability to achieve commercial success, or
 whether Futurist art and performance were sometimes complicated by other
 motives. Or, to put matters more generally: does sensing the potential
 power of mass culture and the consequent necessity of participating in it
 mean that one is endorsing the commodity status of art and reducing the
 test for artistic excellence to box-office receipts? Did the Futurists
 believe that art had become simply a commodity, an exchange value to be
 determined by the marketplace, that is, by the demand it could generate,
 rather than by the intrinsic worth of the art object as determined by
 the traditional means of evaluation by professional critics and other
 artists? Did the Futurists hitch their star to the consumer society
 wherever that might lead in terms of the definition of art, the standards
 to which it was beholden, and control over its production?

<P>
To answer these questions in the affirmative would certainly be to upset
the usual understanding of what aesthetic modernism was about. Yet this
has not prevented at least one recent critic from concluding that "the
deeper rationale of its [Futurism's] apparently irrational metaphysic was
quite simply that of the market," that it retained no critical leverage
against the reduction of artistic value to marketplace demand, and that
"the logic of consumerism . . . [was] welcomed [by the Futurists] as the
perfect antidote to a decadent economy of accumulation and repression."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P>
In my view this argument is too extreme. There is no question that the
Futurists aimed at mass appeal, but there are several senses in which
they were less than fully adapted to marketplace logic. They insisted,
for instance, on an antagonistic self-presentation before their
audiences--the famous "pleasure in being booed" so much in evidence
at their "evenings" <I>(serate), </I>a topic we will take up farther
on. This "pleasure" certainly contributed to their notoriety, but it
also evidenced an &eacute;litist view of themselves as above the masses
for whom they performed and, thus, as the final arbiter of the value
of their art. Moreover, by no means all their enterprises were aimed at
a mass audience. The "edizioni Futuriste di <I>Poesia</I>"--books that
Marinetti continued to edit for several years after the last issue of
the journal <I>Poesia </I>appeared



<B></B>



in October 1909--were aimed at an audience of no more than a thousand
(as their publication runs attested) and their quality was uncompromising.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Finally, in those few texts in which they discussed the concept of
 value, Futurists did not reduce it to market exchange.

<P>
One of the fullest of these discussions is the manifesto, "Weights,
Measures, and Prices of Artistic Genius," written in 1914 by Bruno
Corradini and Emilio Settimelli, two of the young cohort of Florentine
Futurists who would edit <I>L'Italia futurista </I>during the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 They are unabashed in their enthusiasm for the idea that "the
 producer of artistic creativity must join the commercial organization
 which is the muscle of modern life." They pooh-pooh "criticism" as
 "pass&eacute;ist pseudo-criticism" and claim it has "no right to make
 judgments." Instead they invoke the more positivist sounding terms
 "measurer" and "measurement." "Measurers" should judge art the way all
 human activities are judged: by the raw amount nervous energy put into
 them. Such traditional critical standards as beauty and inspiration
 should be rejected, and something called "value," which is based on
 "natural rarity," should be put in their place. In the "intellectual
 field," they claim, "rarity" is a direct function of the quantity of
 "cerebral energy" needed for production. "The Futurist measurement
 of a work of art means an exact scientific determination expressed
 in formulae of the quality of cerebral energy represented by the work
 itself, independently of the good, bad or non-existent impression which
 people may have of the work."

<P>
Despite the appeal to science and objectivity, then, artistic
value for these Futurists is strictly a function of the artist's
"cerebral energy" and has nothing to do with external reception
in the marketplace. Moreover, the "measurer" is not some external
authority but the Futurist himself. It is the "Futurist measurer" who
"will . . . analyse the work of art into the individual discoveries of
relationships of which it consists, determine by means of calculations
the rarity of each discovery, that is the quantity of energy necessary
to produce them, fix on the basis of this rarity a fixed price for each
one of them, add up the individual values, and give the overall price
of the work." Why any of this should be done by the producer rather
than by simply allowing the market to determine price and value is
left undiscussed. What is clear is only that "because all that matters
is the quantity of energy manifested, the artist will be permitted all
forms of eccentricity, lunacy or illogicality." True "genius" invariably
manifests such qualities. Of course, some purported geniuses are "frauds"
(D'Annunzio, Puccini, and Leoncavallo are cited as examples). Far from
trusting the market to eliminate them, these Futurists ask "the state
to create a body of law for the purpose of guarding and regulating the
sale of genius."

<P>
Futurism operates in venues that are frequented by the masses, but it
clings to a modernist mode of establishing artistic value and refuses
to accept the masses as the arbiter of taste. In their amalgam of
avant-gardism, modernism, and mass culture, Futurists seek to exploit the
gap between their own autonomous "calculation" of artistic taste and that
of the masses both as a means of creating notoriety for themselves and
of exerting critical leverage against features of the actually existing,
"sacralized" bourgeois culture they oppose. In short, the Futurists want
to have matters



<B></B>



 both ways. They know they have to play to a mass audience, using the
 modern media and technologies it will appreciate, but they also seek to
 remain firmly in control of their own product. Neither the masses nor
 culture-industry capitalists are to have any say about what ought to
 be produced or how. In this respect they remain as firmly modernist as
 Baudelaire or Mallarm&eacute;. Faced with a mass culture that threatened
 to negate them, all the early modernists understand that there is no
 possibility of retreat; modern forces have to be faced, and, since
 that is so, they may as well be embraced. If this means the end of
 "Art with a capital A," then so be it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, to submit to exchange value as the determinant of
 artistic worth and, thus, of the kind of art that should and would
 be produced, threatens the extinction of the autonomous artistic
 enterprise. Most modernists before the Futurist generation turned
 inward and retreated before this threat, but the Futurists respond by
 seeking to reshape the artistic vocation within a mass culture that they
 hope to control. In their hands modernism moves beyond being simply a
 reaction formation to mass culture. They see the culture of posters,
 advertisements, and commercial design generally as a new means to
 stimulate cultural life and to subvert its tired, "pass&eacute;ist,"
 bourgeois forms. And they are brazen (or foolhardy) enough to believe
 that it is they who will ride herd over an emerging global mass culture.

3. Milan, Marinetti, and the International Futurist Roadshow
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Though best known as the apex of the industrial triangle that grew up
in Northern Italy after 1895, and for the socialist and trade-union
movements that accompanied this industrialization, Marinetti's Milan
was also undergoing a major cultural transformation that included the
development of significant culture industries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 These were the years of major expositions, the largest of which--at
 84,000 square meters of enclosed space--was the International Exposition
 of 1906. Grand department stores also appeared, and professional sports
 took off. The Touring Club of Italy, based in Milan, organized its first
 automotive <I>"giro d'Italia" </I>in 1901, and motorcycle racing also
 became popular. The first Milanese soccer team, the "Milan Cricket and
 Football Club," was formed in 1899. Clubs for mountain-climbing, skiing,
 and rowing, all formed in the late nineteenth century, became more active
 (the first <I>coppa Milano </I>in rowing dates from 1904), and bicycling,
 iceskating, rollerskating, marksmanship, tennis, fencing, wrestling,
 boxing, and aviation all began to find enthusiastic participants and
 spectators.

<P>
Theater-going remained a major focus of cultural life--these were the
Arturo Toscanini years at La Scala--but its audiences became less
aristocratic as private boxes were sold off and ticket prices were
standardized; and, increasingly, operas produced, such as Giacomo
Puccini's <I>Madama Butterfly </I> or <I>La fanciulla del West
</I>, were aimed at a mass audience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Part of what made this possible was the growing acceptance of repertory
 opera, which meant that the opera season could be based, year in and
 year out, on the same fifteen or twenty "classic" operas. Alongside
 traditional theater, audiences grew for operettas, variety theater,
 circuses,



<B></B>



and, above all, for the silent cinema, which had its golden age in the
Italy of the immediate prewar years. In Milan, cinema prices averaged
only about fifty cents (half that for children and military personnel),
and an elegant theater, the Centrale, was constructed in the Galleria next
to its northern portico. The first cinema production company in Italy was
formed in Turin in 1908, but by 1914 Milan had three. The new films they
produced presented longer narratives, and by 1913 large blockbuster shows
such as Mario Caserini's <I>Last Days of Pompeii, </I>Enrico Guazzoni's
<I>Quo Vadis, </I>and Giovanni Pastrone's <I>Cabiria </I>were attracting
huge audiences.

<P>
These years also witnessed the emergence of mass journalism under the
leadership of Luigi Albertini, editor of Milan's <I>Corriere della Sera
</I>from 1900 to 1921.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
During these two decades its print run increased from about 75,000 to
over 600,000, as major Lombard firms gave it their financial backing. The
<I>Corriere </I>became the model, not only for other city newspapers
but also for more partisan ones like the Socialist <I>Avanti!, </I>which
had a daily circulation of 400,000 in 1914.

<P>
What fueled all these developments, in addition to the growth of
industrial capitalism, was an enormous increase in urban population. In
the hundred years up to 1914, Milan's population nearly quintupled
from about 140,000 to 655,004. Much of the increase reflected a
pattern of migration into the city from nearby farms. The influx
produced major problems such as a housing crisis, but also stimulated
many modern infrastructural changes, such as new buildings and road
widenings downtown, the development of public transportation (trams
were electrified in 1899), and the expansion of telephone service
(lines went underground beginning in 1901 and the first calls to Paris
were put through in 1902). From the perspective of the new mass-culture
industries, however, the main point was the vast increase in the size
of potential audiences and their changed character with the swelling
tide of recent rural immigrants.

<P>
What sort of offerings should be made to such an audience? One answer
would be simply to give it <I>kitsch, </I>while also cordoning off a small
&eacute;lite sector where genuine art would continue to prevail. This
is an answer often associated with modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Marinetti's answer, however, was quite different. He sought to raise
 <I>kitsch </I>to art or, perhaps more accurately, to blend <I>kitsch
 </I>and art in a way that satisfied both the recent rural immigrants and
 other workers in the audience as well as the poets on stage. His mode
 of art aimed to preserve the standards associated with artistic autonomy
 while also catering to the masses. And it had the additional advantage of
 continuing to appeal to the taste for exoticism among the aristocratic
 elements in his audience (elegant ladies not infrequently attended his
 <I>serate</I>),<I> </I>while almost entirely bypassing the need to cater
 to the bourgeoisie. In short, he saw himself as both a new specialist
 in mass cultural entrepreneurship who knew how to retain control of
 the artistic product and as the leader of a pocket of resistance to
 the bourgeoisie and its sacralized high culture. For a brief period
 at the end of World War I, he even dreamed that this resistence could
 galvanize the masses sufficiently to become the basis of a new society.



<B></B>

<P>
In the founding manifesto of Futurism, Marinetti claimed that "the oldest
of us is thirty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In fact, when these words appeared in <I>Le ro </I>in February 1909,
 Marinetti was already thirty three and had been involved in avant-garde
 circles in Paris and Milan for well over a decade. Yet the prevarication
 was truly revealing in one respect: Marinetti was already a longstanding
 and adept practitioner of the art of self-publicity via the carefully
 manufactured image.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 <I>Poesia </I>was a sumptuously produced journal with a circulation
 that may have reached 40,000 copies by its final issue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 It sold for the then-astronomical price of ten lire, but this was more
 a reflection of Marinetti's image of the journal than a desire for
 profit-making. Marinetti gave away many copies to people he wished
 to influence, and he financed the enterprise partly on the basis of
 a substantial inheritance he had received from his father, a wealthy
 businessman with links to Egypt who died in 1907. He used contacts
 with some of his father's old Egyptian cronies, then stationed in
 Paris, to get his manifesto published in <I>Le ro, </I>which was
 sometimes known as the "Jockey Club's daily" and was very far from the
 bohemian world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 As a direct spinoff of this publication, Marinetti got press coverage
 in many major dailies in other European capitals, and he further fanned
 the flames himself by writing literally hundreds of letters to prominent
 European intellectuals promising to reprint their evaluations of Futurism
 in <I>Poesia.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
<I> </I>A few months later he managed to get his play <I>Roi Bombance
</I>produced by the posh Marigny Theater. And he punched out critics,
and even fought one duel, to create yet more scandal.

<P>
These examples of Marinetti's self-promotional activity could be
multiplied at length. As a whole they make overwhelmingly clear that
what drove the young Marinetti was much less ideological conviction than
entrepreneurial ambition, albeit of an unconventional, cultural sort. Yet,
though the energy and singlemindedness with which he pursued this vocation
was without peer, there were a few others from whom he had learned a
trick or two. One of these was his friend Umberto Notari, who had made
his name in 1904 as the author of <I>Quelle signore </I>(Those Women)
a novel set in a bordello that had sold 80,000 copies in six months.

 It was Notari's good fortune to be accused of obscenity by a court in
 Parma two years later. Marinetti, who attended and clearly relished
 the trial, wrote a detailed account of it for the Parisian readers of
 <I>Gil Blas, </I>and then translated his account into Italian, appending
 a brief, self-congratulatory introduction. It reads in part:

Notwithstanding the triumphant Americanism of his journalistic career,
it would have been difficult for Notari to have gained the resounding
success that he has with his novel, even to this day, had the Attorney
for the King of Parma, during the provincial festivals, not had an idea
worthy of a sublime Barnum: that of denouncing the pornographic immoralism
of the book, which, by his order, was seized and prosecuted. . . . It is
impossible to imagine such an atmosphere when one has, right and left,
seductive journalists who put their feet up on the table, promising you
voluptuous publicity, and when you have before you orators who take
such dangerous gambits. . . . The sentence of the Parma Tribunal was
proclaimed immediately through every channel of publicity, and this gave
an extraordinary boost to the book's sales such that, today, one finds

<P>
Four years later, Marinetti would succeed in getting his own effort at
high pornography, <I>Mafarka il futurista, </I>tried for obscenity, an
event that kept him in the limelight like none other.

<P>
Evidence of political convictions, particularly irredentism and
nationalism, are not entirely lacking in the young Marinetti. In 1908,
for example, he traveled to Trieste to carry a wreath at the funeral of
the mother of Guglielmo Oberdan--a young Italian who had been executed
in 1882 by the Austrians for a murder plot against the Emperor and who
had then become a martyr to the irredentist cause. While there, Marinetti
was arrested for an anti-Austrian speech.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Yet, in the absense of much political writing, such acts can always also
 be read in the same light as the Mafarka trial or the Trieste <I>serata
 </I>of 1910, which again raised the irredentist theme in a context of
 theatrical showmanship. It is difficult to escape the impression that
 what counted most for the young Marinetti was performing the self;
 politics was simply a useful theater for that performance.

<P>
Much the same could be said for Notari. He, too, was not without
political convictions, but they were always subordinated to essentially
self-promotional acts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 In 1910, for example, he attempted to form his own "Italian Association
 of the Avant-garde" and published a long manifesto called <I>Noi
 </I>(Us) in which a number of the political causes he favored were
 discussed, above all a campaign, supported by Marinetti, to get the
 Vatican expelled from Italy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Yet, in a self-advertisement on the first page, Notari listed ten other
 books he had already authored, including four novels, two of which,
 he noted, had been "tried for obscenity"; three books of politics
 and sociology; two of journalism; and one play (a staged version of
 two of his novels). His ad also noted that <I>Noi </I>was a volume of
 one hundred fifty pages; in fact, the reader can easily see that it
 has only one hundred nineteen very small pages with very large print
 and wide spacings. In this context, the claims the manifesto makes
 about imminent formation of the "Association," Notari's draft of its
 constitution, and his plans for its "convention" in San Marino, are
 difficult to take seriously as political projects.

<P>
Despite their many similarities, however, there are at least three
important differences between the self-promotional styles of Marinetti
and Notari which are instructive in clarifying Marinetti's distinctive
orientation. The first is that Notari's approach to the new sphere of
mass culture was always much more that of a conventional businessman than
Marinetti's. Perhaps because Notari had been born into a working-class
family in Bologna and never had the flexibility associated with
Marinetti's independent wealth, he was always much more driven by
profit-making motives and much more prone to give his mass audience
precisely what it demanded. Though his work does use gentle ironies to
provoke its audience, the gap between the artist's autonomous taste and
that of the masses, which Marinetti never ceased to exploit, is completely
absent in Notari. Thus, for example, while Marinetti's intense opposition
to <I>"passatismo"</I> was an implicit criticism of his audience and
of Italy's museum and tourist culture, Notari actually used his main
journal of the prewar



<B></B>



period, <I>Verde e Azzurro</I>, to help promote Italy as a land of
tourism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Moreover, while Notari explicitly invoked a modernist aesthetic, his
 great passion was the new world of mass sport, which he approached with
 the mind of an ardent fan.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Though not without articles on literature, art, and theatre, <I>Verde e
 Azzurro </I>made its name for its coverage of sports, the first journal
 in Italy to do so. Indeed, Marinetti later recalled that <I>Verde e
 Azzurro</I>, popular enough to develop over time into a daily, "had
 provided the impetus for the first marathons of twenty thousand young
 men, bare-chested in the sun, racing competitively through the streets
 of Milan."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The other promotion for which the Notari became known in the prewar
 period was an international traveling fair of Italian commercial
 products. After the war he developed <I>L'Ambrosiano, </I>the Milanese
 daily best known for its coverage of sports. By 1926 he had also founded
 and was editing a business daily, <I>La Finanza d'Italia, </I>and his
 books in the postwar perior are mostly economic discourses done in
 a humorous vein, a genre that Massimo Bontempelli dubbed "novelistic
 economics" <I>(economia romanzata)</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 While the avant-gardist impulse that gave rise to <I>"Noi"</I> never
 entirely died out--another of his dailies, edited during the war years,
 was <I>Gli Avvenimenti, </I>the "third page" of which was overseen by the
 Futurist poet Paolo Buzzi--it gradually diminished, and by the fascist
 era it had been reduced to a stylistic flourish within a mainstream
 publishing business.

<P>
A second difference in their self-promotional styles is that, while
both men demonstrated enormous energies, Marinetti lived his life--and
especially the half-dozen years after the first Futurist manifesto--in a
perpetual international whirlwind. Carlo Linati, who initially co-edited
<I>Verde e Azzurro </I>with Notari and also knew Marinetti well,
credited the latter after his death in 1944 with "having presented us
with a totally new human type: a kind of model of the 'man in a hurry,'
an agitator of the spirit which the times probably called for and of
which, up to now, we have had no more historical examples."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 During the first Futurist years, Marinetti never ceased being on the
 run, giving "conferences," exhibitions, and <I>serate</I> in two dozen
 Italian cities and a dozen countries, and managing all the details
 himself. As two of his young Futurist disciples marveled, "Marinetti
 spends half of his life on the train: war correspondent and soldier
 in Tripoli and Bengasi and in the Bulgarian trenches of Adrianopolis;
 Futurist propagandist in Paris, Bruxelles, Madrid, Moscow, Petersburg,
 Milan, Palermo. His home is not the Casa Rossa of Milan nor the Excelsior
 Hotel in Rome but the railroad car."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 All told, between 1909 and 1915 he paid four extended visits to London,
 seven to Paris, four to Berlin, two to Brussels, and one each to Russia,
 Libya, and Bulgaria, and he did roughly twenty-five <I>serate </I>from
 Trieste to Palermo and Turin to Catanzaro. At the same time, he was
 producing literally hundreds of poems, articles, and manifestos.

<P>
Finally, though Notari certainly appreciated how consumerism and the
new technologies of communication and transportation had revolutionized
the conditions of cultural production, Marinetti was more acute in his
theoretical understanding of these developments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 As he boasted to a female admirer just after the publication of the
 founding manifesto:

I also enjoy a lucid knowledge of my epoch. I believe that the methods of
action and intellectual propulsion today cannot be those of fifty years
ago. I believe that the most fertile and reinvigorating ideas cannot
be propagated by the book. Ideas in books are hopelessly bewildering
to people, given the flood of industrial and commercial forces, and the
sickness and tiredness of the human brain, shaken by the incessant racket
of economic interests in a life that has become, for almost everyone,
more cinematographic and anxious than ever. We must therefore adapt
the movement of ideas to the frenetic movement of our acts. In this
regard, isn't it absurd how the <I>Giornale d'Italia </I>these days makes
accusations against me, asking ironically if Alessandro Manzoni would have
proclaimed his romanticism by designing huge billboards, with bright red
lettering on a white background, declaring 'Romanticism-Manzoni'? Does it
make sense to you, dear friend, that there might be something in common
between our life today and the one our grandparents led? . . . Let's
conclude: I think that today one can propagate an idea perfectly by
splashing two-color posters on the walls of our great cities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For Marinetti, the main problem with the older generation of writers,
like D'Annunzio, is that they fail to understand how the book has been
superseded and how, to have any practical effect on popular behavior,
they have to avoid verbal complexity, literariness, and other elements
that create distance between writer and reader.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

<P>
This point is worth bearing in mind as one considers the attitude towards
the masses inscribed in Marinetti's public performances. He certainly
derides the audiences of his <I>serate</I> for their stupidity, credulity,
and docility, yet he also knows that his ability to provoke them with the
longwinded readings of the poets on stage derives from the new mode of
cultural production he has discerned in contemporary society. Moreover,
he fully recognizes that this new mode is linked to a rising society of
consumerism, which is in turn predicated on mass appeal, that is, on
the greatest possible breadth of appeal. In this sense he understands
that he is wholly dependent upon his audiences, that the spectacle is
nothing without them. And he is quick to exploit their power in order to
create a new more spontaneous and participatory style of performance. In
this performance the audience becomes the power of the city crowd into
which the poet-<I>fl&acirc;neurs</I> have wandered; the excitement
and the spontaneous, unforseeable turns in the event depend on it, not
them. The notoriety of the performance, the possibility of yet bigger,
more spectacular, more turbulent, raucous, and violent <I>serate</I> in
the future, likewise depend on it, not them.

<P>
Thus, while each <I>serata </I>unfolded as a unique event, there were
a number of carefully orchestrated stages through which they typically
proceeded.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 First, days before the event itself, groups of Futurists would display
 themselves--like the goods in a department-store window--at a local,
 <I>chic </I>caf&eacute;, or they would stage their arrival at the
 local railway station with absurdist ceremony. Soon enticement would
 be supplemented by printed advertisement--leaflets handed out on street
 corners, posters tacked up on walls. Then, on the day of the event, hours
 before its announced starting time, crowds would begin milling about in a
 carnival atmosphere in some <I>piazza </I>near the rented theater, which
 would be the grandest available. Gradually they would enter the theater,
 becoming steadily rowdier as their numbers increased, and would begin to
 pelt the empty stage with whatever they had brought for that purpose. The



<B></B>



Futurists would deliberately delay their own arrival perhaps two or three
hours, the better to overheat the atmosphere. Then, dressed formally in
"smoking jackets" to accent their aristocratic difference, they would
alight on stage and, one by one in the spotlight, declaim their verse or
manifesto, often to the accompaniment of intensified pelting. Finally,
to prove that the violence had left them unfazed and to reemphasize the
ultimate separateness that their genius required, they would troop off
in a post-performance procession to the local caf&eacute; for late-night,
private merriment.

<P>
The performance, in this wide sense, staged the separateness, absence, and
difference of the Futurists at every turn, even while it sought to provoke
the audience into a leading role in making the event spontaneous. It
played with the ambiguity of dependence (we are the goods that you are
buying) and domination (we declaim regardless of what you throw). You are
the <I>passatisti, </I>and we, the <I>Futuristi. </I>You buy our tickets,
honor us with your presence, make us famous, yet we remain Futurist
geniuses autonomously pursuing our own pure art. The result is theater,
but it is variety theater, not the mainstream "contemporary theater
(verse, prose, and musical) . . . [which] vacillates stupidly between
historical reconstruction (pastiche or plagiarism) and photographic
reproduction of our daily life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 In the <I>serata, </I>as in the variety theater, there is a flight from
 mimesis, an acting out of the desire to present rather than represent so
 characteristic of every modernist aesthetic. The <I>serata </I>appears
 to declaim, to remain wedded to the printed book of poetry, yet this
 declaiming is never didactic or educational, never an end in itself;
 it has become a vehicle designed to elicit the main performance as
 a spontaneous act of audience and Futurists together. D'Annunzio's
 plays, however grandly staged, remained representations rather
 than true theatrical presentations. Only in the variety theater and
 <I>serata</I>--only, that is, in the theater of the new mass culture--was
 an avant-garde, modernist performance possible.

<P>
To the Futurists, then, modernism and mass culture were not merely
compatible but mutually reinforcing: only through a reconstructed
mass-cultural performance was it possible to realize the modernist value
of a pure, non-mimetic art. In essence, this performance is a provocative
staging of difference which aims to generate friction sufficient to ignite
its potential for spontaneity. While, as performance, this is new, it is
important to recognize that its staging of difference traded on a very
old structure within modernist art. As Peter Nicholls has incisively
demonstrated, Baudelaire constructed an ironically anti-social position
for the poet by inserting two voices within the poem. In one voice,
Baudelaire sympathizes with a young girl of the lower classes (or the
faces of a crowd or some other ration of the masses); in the other,
the girl or the crowd or the masses become simply the occasion for the
poem, and the reader is forced to confront the irony that the poem's
subjects are nothing without the poet who commemorates them. With the
first voice he makes clear that the poet is as poor as the girl; with
the second, that he does not wish to become close to her, that there is
a gap between them he does not wish to cross.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

<P>
The Futurist staging of difference is structurally identical, and it
would repeat itself during the war when the Futurists, having celebrated
war and incited the Italians



<B></B>



to intervene, strongly identified with the mass of ting soldiers
and yet also insisted on setting themselves apart in their "Futurist
squads," which were usually devoted to the most technologically exciting
and ostensibly daring activities such as the armored-car division or the
aviation unit. When, in June 1917, the Italian High Command created the
&eacute;lite units known as <I>arditi </I>in order to try to break the
stalemate with the Austrians, Futurists flocked to them as if to further
institutionalize their sense of difference from ordinary soldiers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The resulting alliance of Futurists and <I>arditi </I>lasted into the
 postwar period and provided an important source of early Fascism.

<P>
It was in the early postwar context that Marinetti's revolutionized
his political objectives and began to fantasize a counter-bourgeois
political order with the Futurists installed as the new political
class. "I believe that parliamentarism, a fallacious and short-lived
institution, is destined to perish," he wrote in May 1919. "I believe
that Italian politics will inevitably see its death throes hastened,
unless it shows its flexibility by substituting the artists--geniuses
at creation--for the class of lawyers--geniuses at dissolution and
excuse-making--that have monopolized it up to now. . . . It is above
all from the lawyerly spirit that we want to liberate Italian politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 The new, non-lawyerly, non-parliamentary order would abolish prisons and
 police, reduce government to the minimum, dissolve the family for free
 love, and, most importantly in light of the present discussion, promote
 a new, free artistic sphere. Six months later, Marinetti spelled out
 the details of this new sphere which, since it would be "lavished upon
 everyone," would "multiply the number of creative artists." Life would
 "no longer be simply one of bread and labor, nor one of idleness, but
 one of <I>life as a work of art [vita-opera d'arte]."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 As such images suggest, however, the spirit of these writings is
 festively anarchic, and they leave unclear just how participatory this
 new sphere would be (Marinetti's category, <I>"gli artisti,"</I> appears
 caste-like throughout) or how the mass culture that had emerged before
 the war might be reinstitutionalized.

<P>

4. Futurism and Women
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Another topic to which Marinetti gave careful attention in his postwar
political writings was the emancipation of women, towards which, as is
well-known, he was quite favorable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In part, this sympathy probably reflected the changed position of
 women in Italian society generally, and in the Futurist movement in
 particular, during the war. Yet, as we have just seen, Marinetti never
 felt bound to a politics of realism. Nor were his postwar political
 writings the first place he had expressed the view that women ought
 to be granted the same social and political rights and opportunities
 as men. Marinetti's notorious expression of a "scorn for woman" in his
 founding manifesto has tended to obscure not only the enthusiasm many
 women felt for Futurism but also the nature of Marinetti's "scorn."

<P>
From the beginning Marinetti's persona, style, and ideas appealed to many
women, especially poets, and he was receptive enough to their creative
efforts to make a substantial place for them in <I>Poesia</I>. Indeed,
one of the most notable aspects



<B></B>



of the journal was just how many female contributors it had. At a time
when women were almost completely excluded both from mainstream journalism
and avant-garde reviews, <I>Poesia </I>published the poetry of roughly
fifty women or about fifteen percent of the journal's total contributors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Many of these women, such as Ada Negri, remained loyal friends of
 Marinetti to the end of their lives.

<P>
In comparison with their presence in the <I>Poesia </I>years, women were
relatively absent from early Futurism, a fact which the declaration of a
"scorn for women" might appear to explain. Certainly, given his hopes
of transforming Italy in an anticlerical, antiliberal, and intensely
individualist direction, Marinetti was intent upon attracting a very
aggressive male to Futurism. In this regard, the "scorn for women" was
part and parcel of the Futurist cult of speed, sport, force, courage,
danger, and risk, and the Futurist hatred of quietism, the academic,
the classical, the traditional, the nostalgic, and the sentimental. As
such, the phrase reflected the sort of militarist male-bonding that the
Futurists exhibited during the war. It may even have reflected a certain
unacknowledged homoeroticism and "male homosexual panic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Yet, it is also clear that Marinetti intended the phrase not literally
 as a sexist denigration of women (though he undoubtedly would not have
 minded had some men been drawn to Futurism because they misunderstood
 it in that way) but, more subtly, as a denigration of the quietist and
 sentimental virtues traditionally associated with women. Or, to put
 it differently, Marinetti's "scorn for women" was a rejection not of
 women as a biological category, but of the discursive position that
 the feminine had come to assume in fin-de-si&egrave;cle life.

<P>
In a preface to the 1910 Italian translation of <I>Mafarka le futuriste,
</I>for example, Marinetti wrote that, "when I said to them, 'scorn
woman,' everyone threw vulgar insults at me, like so many whores enraged
by a police dragnet. And yet, I wasn't talking about the worth of women as
biological entities but of the sentimental importance that is generally
attributed to them. . . . I want to conquer the tyranny of love, the
obsession with the unique woman, the romantic moonshine that bathes the
facade of the bordello!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 This point is then reiterated in what is perhaps Marinetti's most
 famous declaration on women during the prewar era, "Against <I>Amore
 </I>and Parliamentarism":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We scorn woman conceived as the unique ideal, the divine reservoir of
love, the voluptuous lure, the tragic bibelot, the fragile, obsessing
and fatal woman whose voice, laden with destiny, and whose fairylike
hair, reach out and become entangled with the foliage of the moonlit
forests. . . . In this struggle of ours for liberation, our best allies
are the suffragettes, because the more power and rights they attain
for women, the more woman will cease being a mere provider of love and
hotbed of sentimental passion and luxury. . . . If women dream today of
winning their political rights, it is indisputably because they feel
deep inside, unconsciously, that as mothers, wives or lovers they are
pent up in a narrow circle, purely animal and devoid of all usefulness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Still more telling is the parallel interpretation of the "scorn woman"
injunction by early Futurist women such as Eva K&uuml;hn Amendola, wife
of the philosopher and later



<B></B>



anti-Fascist Giovanni Amendola, who wrote under the pen name Magamal. In
an essay of 1913, she read Futurism's scorn for women as a very positive
"indication that Futurism spells the end of the reign of the eternal
feminine. . . . The future century will speak with disgust and contempt
of an age where men were allowed to exploit the feminine and in which
she was his slave."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 The reign of the "eternal feminine," with all its Puccinian perfumes
 and softness, with woman as symbolic of mere species regeneration and
 motherhood, is coming to an end, and Futurism is the first political
 movement to have understood this and to have set as a goal the hastening
 of this development.

<P>
Besides Magamal, the most famous <I>femme futuriste </I>of the early
years was Valentine Saint-Point, grand-niece of the French poet Alphonse
de Lamartine and a consummate artist in her own right.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Like Magamal, Saint-Point directly confronted the phrase "scorn for
 woman" and read it as a criticism of what women had been, that is, of
 what men had encouraged women to be in the past, but also, of what
 women had allowed themselves to be. Following Nietzsche, she argued
 that the success of that campaign had produced an overly feminized age
 and, thus, the need for a masculine corrective. "What is most lacking
 in women and men alike is masculinity," she wrote in 1912. "That is
 why Futurism, with all its exaggerations, is right."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Women must cease to be fearful of war, nurses who encourage weakness
 or mothers who are "octopuses of the hearth, whose tentacles bleed men
 dry and make their children anaemic." They are the equals of men but
 have been waylaid by sentimentalism and deprived of their sensuous
 instincts. They must return to their instincts, become as strong as
 men, and lead men and themselves to a new heroic age.

<P>
Arguably, Magamal and Saint-Point were exceptional women who cultivated
their sense of being exceptional and were attracted to Futurism on that
basis. Yet, considering Marinetti's many letters from <I>amiche </I>and
the many women who attended his trial and <I>serate </I>(which were not
all-male homoerotic events as has sometimes been claimed), it is clear
that Futurism appealed to many creative women tired of the limited and
familiar options with which bourgeois life presented them and anxious
to forge pathways of their own.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 Nowhere was this demonstrated more clearly than in the fifty-one
 issues of <I>L'Italia futurista, </I>the Florentine journal inspired
 by Marinetti which ran from June 1916 to February 1918.

<P>
The editorial collective that produced <I>L'Italia futurista </I>numbered
seven, of whom one, Maria Ginanni, was a woman. Ginanni was regarded
as their leading poetic talent, but as the war dragged on into 1917,
she became the journal's leading editorial writer as well, and she was
charged with the administration of its publishing house, the Edizioni di
<I>L'Italia futurista, </I>from the beginning. The journal's short life
was tumultuous, and three quite different phases can be identified. In
the first, running from June 1916 to the end of the year (about twelve
biweekly issues), the emphasis is on poetry and prose poems with little
overt political content. The journal's effort to cultivate its evidently
large female readership is, however, already quite apparent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 In the second phase--roughly, the seventeen weekly issues of the first
 half of 1917--the poetry is supplemented by a spirited cheerleading
 for the war, mostly in



<B></B>



articles written by Ginanni. Finally, in the most interesting phase--the
twenty-two issues from mid 1917 to early 1918, the cheerleading
diminishes, and in its place arises a debate about women which was clearly
provoked by a sense of how much the war had altered the lot of women and
by hopes and anxieties regarding the postwar world. Here female writers
in addition to Ginanni--above all Enif Robert, a poet and novelist, and
Rosa Ros&agrave;, a graphic artist and novelist--step to the fore. In
addition, there were occasional contributions from a number of other
women including Magamal, Fanny Dini, Irma Valeria, Fulvia Giuliani, Marj
Carbonaro, Emma Marpillero, and Shara Marini.

<P>
Though consistently avoiding a feminist label as too intellectualist,
these women gave no quarter in the fierceness with which they defended
women's interests. By July 1917, Rosa Ros&agrave; was already predicting
that the war had so toughened women that they will "supersede by a good
deal all the most feminist feminists have hoped." When the soldiers
return home they will find "strong women . . . women whom the war has
shaken up just as much as it has shaken up men."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 In effect, her argument was that Saint-Point's desire for a masculinized
 woman, which had become canonical among Futurist women, was being
 transformed into historical reality. Because of the war, the
 masculine/feminine split had been trumped by one along <I>futurista/
<BR>
passatista </I>lines: we should no longer divide humanity into men and
women but "should begin to divide it into superior, strong, intelligent,
healthy, able-bodied individuals as against the deficient, cretinous,
crippled, and soft."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>

<P>
Such rhetoric was not of course left unchallenged by Futurist men, some
of whom were strongly antagonistic to it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 But this merely provoked Enif Robert to reply with a sociological
 categorization of men--there are the vulgar sexist brutes, the
 intellectualist eunuchs, and those rare men who combine equal quantities
 of physical and mental potency--and she was fully confident that women
 could and would choose intelligently among them. Unlike Ros&agrave;, who
 championed "women who work, study, earn money and create . . . who have
 learned to appropriate for themselves a clean and clear vision of the
 world on their own, independent of men," Robert sought a new male-female
 partnership that redefined love as "an intelligent cooperation between
 two beings who together, with equal rights and equal will," work together
 for common solutions to common problems.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

 </I>(A Woman's Womb).
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>

<P>
The fundamental point, then, that arises from the late issues of
<I>L'Italia futurista </I>is that women who counted themselves Futurist
played an important role in the journal, forced a debate about the "new
woman" and Italian society, and demanded a postwar world based on full
equality between the sexes. Whether or not Futurist men welcomed their
ideas, Futurist women were now sufficiently great in number to demand
inclusion in the world of Futurism. For them, Futurism represented a
vision of social equality that transcended the narrow sphere of political
right, that promised the possibility of a new public sphere based on
the avant-garde's transformative role within mass culture, altogether a
most exciting alternative to the suffocating constrictions of bourgeois
society. Yet I would go further to argue that



<B></B>



Marinetti himself--for reasons having much to do with his commitment to
mass culture--had long recognized the importance of women in Futurism,
and that this was the primary motive which underlay his call for the
emancipation of women. It certainly was no coincidence that he chose
the last two issues of <I>L'Italia futurista </I>as the place to begin
to make this case.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 There, in the midst of an acrimonious debate between Futurist men and
 women, Marinetti positions his Futurism with progressive women and the
 democratizing forces of modernity--and against what he regards as the
 failed romanticism and sexism of the past.

<P>
Yet the story of how women demanded inclusion in the world of Futurism
would not be complete without mention of a curious <I>serata </I>which
took place in Paris in 1926.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 That spring, Marinetti was asked to speak at the weekly gathering of a
 French women's group. At first he demurred, claiming that their proposed
 topic--"whether war toys excite or do not excite violent instincts in
 children"--was too dependent upon the specific culture in question,
 and that he was Italian and they, French. But, after more pressure,
 he agreed, a decision he would regret when, on the appointed day, he
 entered the elegant lecture hall to find about two thousand Parisian
 women awaiting him. Hesitantly, he tried to condense his views into a
 rambling story about how puppies, when they emerge still blind from
 their mother's womb, cruelly battle each other for milk and, in so
 doing, establish a natural hierarchy of strength which is far more
 important for their development as warriors than any toy would ever
 be. Before he could finish, however, his words were "drowned out by a
 deafening burst of feminine shrieks with insulting whistles and ironic
 smiles." They shouted that the <I>patria </I>was dead and that he was a
 <I>passatista, </I>to which he replied that "the supreme civilization
 is the perfected, gigantic <I>patria." </I>And so it went, back and
 forth, until he exited "the hail of virulent insults" and headed for
 the local caf&eacute;. It may not have been Marinetti's last <I>serata,
 </I>but it was very likely his most memorable.

5. Futurism and the Reshaping of the Artistic
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Futurism's view of women was part and parcel of its more general
assessment of, and attempt to alter, the state of contemporary European
mores, degraded as they had been by the feminization of manners in
the nineteenth century. The Futurist gospel was the Nietzschean lament
about worldweariness, and their solution, like his, was a remasculinized
society which would restore to humanity its natural, heroic instincts and
virtues. Though their focus in this project was clearly on men, Marinetti
at least recognized that the demand of Futurist women for inclusion in
the modern world on equal terms with men was both consistent with the
democratic ethos of modernity and, from the point of view of society as
a whole, desirable. In this regard, the hail of invective thrust upon him
by the Parisian women in 1926, however painful, was welcome as yet another
proof that the Futurist ethos was enjoying a certain social success.



<B></B>

<P>
Yet, as we have seen, except for a brief period in the immediate postwar
era, the Futurists did not conceive this project politically as part of
a revolutionary reconstruction of society. Rather they believed that
economic and technological forces which had grown up in the west were
operating globally to alter the human lifeworld, and that the artist's
role was to hasten this development, especially in those societies
most infected by lingering <I>passatismo. </I>So, at least, does the
Futurist project appear if we look back from the vantage point of
the 1920s. Looking forward from 1909, however, Futurism appears more
like just a new style of mass entertainment, one that thrust modernist
intellectuals into an eroticized <I>pas de deux </I>with the urban crowd
it had seduced through its well-orchestrated advertising campaign. Yet,
even this pursuit of commercial success as entertainment involved a
reshaping of the artistic vocation that few artists or intellectuals
besides the Futurists were prepared, or knew how, to undertake.

<P>
Futurism was the first artistic movement to show how a modernist aesthetic
of autonomy and a commitment to quality could be realized in mass-cultural
venues and with mass-cultural forms and techniques. Marinetti understood
that the short and discontinuous acts of the variety theatre, for example,
were much more amenable to a non-mimetic aesthetic of presentation than
was the now sacralized sphere of traditional high art. And he understood
that while some mass-cultural venues were male bastions--variety theater
had something of this character, vaudeville still more--mass culture as
a whole was very attractive to women. With the <I>serata </I>he proved
able to produce a form that toyed with a sado-masochistic ritual of
male-bonding even as it excited new liberating fantasies for women
tired of corsets and demure dinner parties. But, quite independent of
Marinetti's escapades, artistic women saw Futurism as something they
could appropriate for themselves, and they used it to try to advance
objectives which, while not literally feminist, were certainly connected
with new liberating social roles for women. And in accepting their right
to be part of Futurism, Marinetti further reshaped the artistic vocation.

<P>
Among the assumptions in Marinetti's early concept of Futurism were that
mass culture was the only form of art in tune with the inherent democracy
of modern everyday life; that mass culture was only now in the process of
being invented and so was fully capable of being creatively reshaped; and
that so long as that reshaping remained in tune with modern conditions,
Futurists could fuse modernism with mass culture in a way that would allow
them to retain control over their artistic product. Though all of these
assumptions were plausible in 1909, the last of them would eventually
prove to be the Futurist Achilles' heel. For while Marinetti was right
to think that mass culture offered fertile ground for modernism, he
was wrong to imagine that his modernist, mass-cultural synthesis would
ultimately prevail against purely commercialized competition. That many
later artistic movements, like the French and Italian avant-garde cinema
of the 1950s and 1960s, made the same mistake, may lead us to excuse
Marinetti's na&iuml;vet&eacute;. But it does not diminish the irony of
Futurism's concerted effort in the 1930s to be recognized as official
Fascist art.



<B></B>



For just as Futurism was attempting to seduce a false master, the true
master was seducing Futurism.

<P>
As the Futurist Fortunato Depero sighed wistfully in 1931, after a
two-year sojourn in New York, "the shop windows along the most luxurious
avenue in the world, in other words New York's Fifth Avenue, are for the
most part Futurist. . . . At every streetcorner, in every space reserved
for advertising, I see myself more or less plagiarized or robbed,
with more or less intelligence, with more or less taste; my vibrant
colors, my crystalline and mechanical style, my metallic vegetation,
fauna and humanity, geometric and fantastic, is greatly imitated and
exploited." But then, regaining his Futurist composure, he added: "This
pleases me very much; even though I have dedicated myself to advertising
only for a limited time, I recognize and do not hesitate to say that I
have been influential."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 In the end then, perhaps, Futurism's failure to reinvent mass culture
 in its own image and dominate it did not matter. For more than any
 other avant-garde movement, it did leave an indelible mark on modern
 culture, and our sense of what modern culture is would not have been
 the same without it.

assurda, a questo propostio, l'accusa che mi maneva il <I>Giornale

Alessandro Manzoni non avesse dovuto proclamare il romanticismo con degli
avvisi enormi che recassero, in rosso vivo sul bianco, queste parole:

<p>
The story of the "Wunschkonzert" in Nazi Germany is at the same time
the history of one of the most successful propaganda projects to take
place in the Third Reich. "Wunschkonzert," literally "Wish-Concert" but
translated more faithfully as "concert by request," was originally the
name of an extremely popular radio program in which listeners could send
in bids for their favorite songs and have them played by a live orchestra
before what was truly a national audience. It was also the name of a
1940 Nazi film <I>about </I>that radio program which itself has been
described as one of the biggest German box office hits of the wartime.

<P>
My task will be to tell those two stories, one about the radio program,
the other about the film, as a way of talking about the role of the
entertainment industry as a disseminator of Nazi propaganda during the
twelve-year period between 1933 and 1945. Works about propaganda in the
Third Reich often barely even mention the role of the "Wunschkonzert."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 When one thinks of mass media in the service of the Nazi Party, what most
 likely comes to mind are films such as Leni Riefenstahl's <I>Triumph
 of the Will </I>about the 1934 Nazi party rally at Nuremberg or her
 extraordinary documentary film about the 1936 Olympics. Or one might
 think of the scurrilous anti-Semitic films like <I>Jud S&uuml;ss </I>or
 <I>The Eternal Jew, </I>which were made and distributed in preparation
 for the final solution beginning in 1941. Or, most insistently, one
 is reminded of the shrill, piercing radio voice of the F&uuml;hrer
 himself, intoning his messages of hate over airwaves controlled by the
 one-party system.



<B></B>

<P>
But these were not the only means that the Party employed for garnering
support and political legitimation. Nor were they the most successful
ones. Of increasing importance was the use of light entertainment in
an attempt to bind together the <I>Volksgemeinschaft, </I>the community
of the <I>Volk </I>or the people as they called it, into one big happy
family. The early years of Nazi rule saw the official media featuring the
spectacle of marching troops, torch parades, political speeches to the
masses, and brown shirt films directed toward organizing disenchanted male
youth into the party. However, it soon became clear to Joseph Goebbels
and his entire ministry that the <I>Volk </I>was simply fed up with all
this "politics." The answer, they decided, was to make the invocation of
their political message a less obvious and overbearing one, to present
their political positions in the wrappings of culture.

<P>
Certainly the radio would play a very special role in the new
communication system. In the development of larger goals, radio
programs were seen as having to transcend the pluralism and excessive
intellectuality of the Weimar Republic in order to strive for a
<I>Volkbildung </I>(the formation rather than simply the education of
a people) in a larger sense: now they spoke of forming a new folk soul
of "true and genuine life"; of a "deeper" sense of values than are
communicated in the belief systems of bourgeois democracies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 This "metaphysics of the radio," as it was called, suggested almost
 a religious calling, and was literally defined as such in a leading
 media journal: "The art of the radio <I>[Rundfunkkunst] </I>seeks to
 leave the marketplace and return to the church, to a church, which will
 encompass all its listeners with the same atmospheric powers and which
 is capable of bridging distances just like the all uniting House of
 the Lord. Here the central actors are no longer individual destinies,
 but rather ideas, they are community creating powers which speak forth
 with one voice in a manner that moves the many."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
One of the most successful renditions of this "art of the radio," was
the "Wunschkonzert," which has been described as the "miracle working
invention" of Heinz Goedecke.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The program had its debut in January of 1936, and the format as
 originally planned was to have five different orchestras playing over
 a four hour period from eight until midnight on the Deutschlandsender.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 All a listener had to do to participate was to send a request for a
 particular song accompanied by a donation for the <I>Winterhilfswerk
 </I>(social welfare for the poor). With that they would be able to hear
 their selection along with a dedication. As it turned out, the initial
 responses went considerably beyond expectations and by March of 1936
 the program was expanded to six hours of programming.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In short, it was a spectacular success, with the result that by the
 end of the fourteenth broadcast shortly before the outbreak of World
 War II, the government had earned well over a quarter of a million marks.

<P>
On 1 October 1939, the organizers premiered a new version of the program
called the "Wunschkonzert f&uuml;r die Wehrmacht" (Wunschkonzert for
the armed forces), which continued the format of calling for donations,
but also made as their central focus the soldiers on the front. The new
format stipulated that soldiers and families of soldiers were the only
ones permitted to participate and that for the remainder of



<B></B>



1939, at least, it was to be broadcast twice a week every Wednesday
and Sunday afternoon from 5:00 to 8:00 before a live audience in a
concert hall.

<P>
And what were the ideological implications of this program? Key for
the creating of a genuine <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>were the musical
selections themselves. Where earlier attempts to use the radio for
cultural legitimation had featured <I>excessive </I>amounts of high
culture--one Beethoven cycle within a twelve day period sent out over
all stations included a performance of <I>Fidelio </I>and the nine
symphonies--the musical offerings of the "Wunschkonzert" contained a
potpourri of material taken from all over the cultural map.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Music from operas and operettas, folk songs, march music, overtures, love
 ballads, children's lullabies, military t tunes, jazz and pop songs,
 were interspersed with classical music and short oral presentations or
 the recitation of poems, etc. The program began with a bugle fanfare
 and Hitler's favorite march, the <I>Badenweiler, </I>and ended with
 a listing of the day's contributors. In between there were musical
 performances by some of the leading artists of the day as well as by
 amateurs who had never performed publicly.

<P>
The regime's emphasis on "light entertainment music" was part of a
growing recognition on the part of Goebbels and the propaganda ministry
concerning the importance of cultural offerings appearing to "interest
the common taste and being understandable and pleasing to the less
sophisticated listener."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Nevertheless, in his dealings with the "Wunschkonzert" itself, Goebbels
 was known to have intervened on numerous occasions in efforts to raise
 the level of its quality by having well known artists take part in
 its programs. Moreover, the increasing pre-censorship of the programs
 on the part of the propaganda ministry often had as much to do with
 the selection of particular pieces and artists as it did with what was
 explicitly said politically in any of the broadcasts. Werner Krauss, Hans
 Albers, Willi Birgel, Zarah Leander, Gustav Gr&uuml;ndgens, Katharina
 S&ouml;derbaum, Jenny Jugo, Hans S&ouml;hnker, Grethe Weiser, Paul
 H&ouml;rbiger, Willy Fritsch, Heinz R&uuml;hmann, and Marika R&ouml;kk
 were just a few of the stars from the world of screen who were coddled
 and in some cases intimidated into making unpaid appearances on the
 program.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
The point, finally, of the "Wunschkonzert" was precisely not to challenge
the audience intellectually, culturally, or above all politically, but
rather to provide in this combination of folksy humor and familiar musical
oldies a mix of high and low culture which would bring together war front
and home front, old and young, children and parents, working people
and the educated bourgeoisie; bring them together into a <I>feel-good
</I>version of the Reich as national family. It was also designed to make
the <I>Volk </I>itself feel actively and vitally involved. If standardized
political propaganda had come to feature the F&uuml;hrer as the vanguard
re haranguing and imploring the masses to ever greater heights of
political and now military commitment to the Fatherland, the coziness
of the "Wunschkonzert" sent a very different message. Here there was
no mention of Blood and Soil, the Aryan master race, or the beauty of
labor; no overbearing use of Nazi iconography or the F&uuml;hrer re
with arm in outstretched salute; no sounds of the Horst Wessel song or
frenzied singing of "Deutschland,



<B></B>



 Deutschland &uuml;ber alles." On the contrary, the mood was one of
 sentimentality, domesticity, and <I>Gem&uuml;tlichkeit</I>--all of which
 was meant to replace the latent violence and heroicized sensation of the
 Nazi public sphere so familiar to us from the cinematic performances
 of Fascist power in the Riefenstahl film. To be sure, there was still
 the military march music, yet it was situated now as but one dimension
 of an expanded horizon in which public and private were conjoined in
 domestic harmony; and in which the aggression of war was transformed--not
 forgotten, certainly not repressed--into the solidity of a deeper kind
 of <I>Volksgemeinschaft. </I>

<P>
This integration of family, state, and war in the "Wunschkonzert" was
particularly important, for it demonstrated how the power of the radio
as a tool of Nazi manipulation lay precisely in its ability to break
down the demarcations of private and public, individual and community,
which was so central an element of the fascist grasp of power. This was
surely one of the reasons why the "Wunschkonzert" was said to have become
the symbol for the entire radio project centering on the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 At the level of the military and war itself, the program was often
 advertised as a direct means of communication, not only between soldiers
 and their families, but also between soldiers and units which had
 become separated from each other. One of the most celebrated incidents
 in this regard was the role it played in paying homage to the captain
 and crew of the U-boat that had carried out a bold attack on the British
 fleet anchored at Scapa Flow in October of 1939. Uncertain as to their
 successes, the bearded men on the returning victorious U-boot turned on
 their radio to the "Wunschkonzert" only to learn that they had indeed
 sunk the mighty battleships <I>The Royal Oak </I>and <I>The Repulse
 </I>and that they had been awarded fifty thousand marks from donations
 to the "Wunschkonzert" for their efforts. In awe of the powers of the
 radio, the victorious Captain G&uuml;nther Prien was quoted as saying:
 "Now here someone has pulled off something that is a thousand times
 better than anything we have achieved."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P>
On a broader comparative level, it should also be mentioned in conclusion
that the paradigm shift occurring within the Nazi public sphere
parallelled as much as it clearly differed from public life in other
advanced industrial societies. As in the United States, 1930s Germany
saw the extensive growth of a culture industry in which mass mediated
techniques of advertising and the commodification of politics changed
the very framework of contemporary social and political life. The move
from a primitive notion of <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>grounded in concepts
of Teutonic ritual and a return to pre-industrial forms of <I>Heimat
</I>(home) and community gave way now to an embracing of more modern
forms of representation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 The building of up-to-date communication systems like the autobahn,
 sound film, television, and air travel, as well as the development of
 vast consumer and war industries, brought a profound transformation
 of cultural forms and of visual and auditory acuity. Where the Nazis
 originally had sustained, at least ideologically, an anti-modern stance
 toward urban culture and contemporary life, they now increasingly sought
 to affirm the potential of technology and modernization precisely as a
 way to enable the values of a national community that would <I>overcome
 </I>the alienation of bourgeois democratic societies.



<B></B>

<P>
Certainly the message of a <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>born out of the
power of technology and the potential of the newest media was also
central to the film <I>Wunschkonzert </I>made by Eduard von Borsody in
1940. And like the radio program, which is so central to its plot-line,
this film also participated in a discourse which claimed to overcome the
separations between home front and war front, private and public, by an
assertion of the healing powers of a benevolent, all domesticating Nazi
public sphere. Von Borsody himself underlines this point by stressing
the differences between present conditions in the Third Reich and the
failures of policy during World War I.

The war front and the home front were no longer able to understand each

<P>
Billed as a musical comedy about the war, the movie <I>Wunschkonzert
</I>tells of two lovers who are separated by war, but who, because
of everlasting love, faithfulness to duty, and some help by a radio
program, are eventually able to reunite within the reaches of a greater
Reich. The story begins when a young girl named Inge Wagner (Ilse Werner)
meets Herbert Koch (Carl Raddatz), a lieutenant in the air force, at the
1936 Olympic games in Berlin. After three days of glorious courtship
she decides to marry him. This initial section of the film is full of
images <I>&agrave; la </I>Riefenstahl of the spectacular Berlin games
together with tourist guide romancing of the highlights in the capital,
all of which is suddenly interrupted by the call to duty of Herbert to
carry out a secret mission with the Condor Legion in support of Franco
in the Spanish civil war. Because Herbert is not permitted to write
letters home, the two lose contact, although Inge never gives up hope,
of course. Time goes by and shortly before the outbreak of the war, a
young ter pilot named Helmut Winkler (Joachim Brennecke) meets and
falls in love with Inge. However, despite the fact that three years have
past since Koch's departure, Inge maintains her vigil and turns down
Winkler's offer of marriage. Thus it is that the major tension of the
film emerges almost at its very outset, namely the tension between the
male fulfillment of duty by the stoic lieutenant Koch and the power of
emotional feelings represented most forcefully by its eternal guardian,
the faithful female Inge Wagner. It is this juxtaposition--it is not,
importantly, staged as a conflict--between deep seated, indefatigable
desire, on the one hand, and the repeated deferment of its gratification
in the name of national duty, on the other, that impels the story to its
inevitable resolution. Yet while Inge's desire is indeed the demiurge
of the action, it is the "Wunschkonzert" which will finally enable its
happy, but also its politically proper ending.

<P>
However, this film is more than just a love story. Imbedded in its plot
are numerous little subplots dealing with men who go to war and others
who stay at home. One concerns a teacher who is inducted into the armed
forces and must leave behind his pregnant wife, only to learn later in
a broadcast of the "Wunschkonzert" that she has



<B></B>



given birth to a son. The announcement is followed by a children's choir
singing the egregiously sentimental lullaby "Schlaf mein Princhen, Schlaf
ein" (Sleep, my little prince, go to sleep). Another recounts the story of
a young man who is a performer of classical music, particularly Beethoven,
and who having sacrificed his life in order to save his comrades has a
song dedicated to his memory for the "Wunschkonzert." Looking through
his notebook, his mother had discovered his handwritten rendering of the
song "Gute Nacht, Mutter" (Goodnight, Mother), and as the whole nation
listens, it is sung to her now over the Deutschlandsender, posthumously
as it were. Yet another subplot offers the comic tale of the two soldiers
who steal five pigs from the French and come to Berlin in order to present
them live and with a singing of their own horrendously kitschy composition
on national radio. Finally, as our plot summaries suggest, each strand
of the narrative is woven into and through the "Wunschkonzert" which
becomes its ultimate apotheosis and resolution.

<P>
Thus the "Wunschkonzert" as a radio program functions within the film
both as a place of national reconciliation and as an agent or player in
bringing about narrative resolution. As a space of renewal it serves to
bridge the gap between home front and war front, and in so doing, quite
literally to sing the praises of the media and of the benevolent party
which have made it all possible. One of the central themes of Third
Reich propaganda was the ever recurring call for the "acquisition of
more <I>Lebensraum," </I>living space, to compensate for what Hitler
himself felt to be the natural claim of the German race to territorial
expansion and rule.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Moreover, as an imperialist slogan it served to justify the need for the
 kinds of expansion which eventually led to the invasions of Poland, the
 Czech Sudetenland, Austria, the western front, and finally the Soviet
 Union; or even the kinds of fantasies that dreamed of regaining lost
 colonies in Southwest Africa.

<P>
In their use of the radio, the Nazis succeeded in opening up still
another, somewhat broadened sense of <I>Lebensraum, </I>this time via
the airwaves. If we speak today of cyberspace as the broaching of a new
frontier, clearly the consolidation of a <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>by means
of networking private and public experience within an expanded frontier
of national space became an important political point of legitimation
and control. Father and mother and newborn babe are brought together
again in ether space, enabled by an apparatus that will link their
individual destinies spatially and communally to the now expanded
familial Reich. Departed son and mourning mother as iconic metaphor
for all the losses in the present and anticipated losses in the future
are united through and in this expanded Reich as a kind of surrogate
religious transcendence.

<P>
Here the cinematic representation of this ethereal Reich is particularly
important. In the birth scene, the shot/reverse-shot editing creates a
relationship between mother and child at home and father at the front,
in which their proximity and intimacy are enhanced by having them stare
directly out of the frame as though beholding each other face to face. The
tilting head of the mother looks up into the father's eyes in a perfect
eyeline match as if she were showing him the baby firsthand. As such,
it serves as a visual expansion of their auditory intimacy, itself bound
together by the



<B></B>



sounds of the saccharine lullaby. A similar intimacy is created in the
final scene between mother and departed son with a camera pan linking
the piano on which he played, a photograph of his face and the mourning
mother--all in full view of the nation at large. In each case, the message
is one in which radio and cinematic media unite under the guidance of
the Party to represent a <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>which now has room
for family values and a domesticated public sphere, promising as well
the possibility for active participation in the shaping of the new cause.

<P>
Yet in addition to being a locus for expanded spatial relationships, the
"Wunschkonzert" also provided resolution for the plot. To understand its
ultimate narrative function in the film, let us return to the main love
story. After waiting in vain for word from her fianc&eacute; Herbert, Inge
suddenly hears his name in a broadcast of the "Wunschkonzert." In memory
of their wonderful days at the Olympic Games, Herbert has requested a
playing of the Olympic anthem, whereupon Inge learns of his location and
writes him a letter requesting a rendezvous. This planned meeting also
goes for nought, as Herbert is once more commandeered to the front. In
the meantime, Inge's friend and unrequited suitor Helmut Winkler ends
up under the command of Koch in the same flying unit. At first they are
unaware that they are in love with the same woman, then Koch discovers
Winkler's attachment and renounces his love for Inge, whereupon Inge
finally arrives on the scene and reaffirms her love for Koch. The two
march off into the dusk to the tune of march music and the images of a
massive war assault against England by sea and air.

<P>
The message of the film seems rather an obvious one. Individual love has
been subordinated to the interests of the community. The somewhat pallid,
if nevertheless heroic Herbert Koch must first complete his military
commitments, twice delaying consummation of their love affair as we,
the audience, are taken on death defying flying missions over the enemy
skies of Spain in 1936 and the Atlantic in 1939. Moreover the consummation
itself, when it finally does occur, is virtually state-initiated by the
all encompassing arm of the "Wunschkonzert." Like the other subplots,
the reconciliation must occur under the auspices of a public sphere which
will weld the two together. Thus it is not at all surprising that Inge,
the agent of narrative desire and closure, will come to her major insight
while listening to this radio program--more specifically the beautiful
strains from the overture to Mozart's <I>The Marriage of ro--</I>at
the very end of the film. Love conquers all, as long as it is in league
with the forces of communitarian truth. Communitarian truth in this
instance is the folksy togetherness of the radio program--now writ large.

<P>
Although the focus of <I>Wunschkonzert </I>remains within the generic
framework of a love comedy, muting its references to the icons and
signification of specifically Nazi politics and history, there are a
number of oblique and not so oblique allusions that mark it clearly
within the historical reference points of contemporary political
events. The opening sequences at the Olympic Stadium, for instance,
splice in documentary material from Riefenstahl's film <I>Olympiad
</I>and newsreel footage highlighting the opening of the games. The film
actually begins with a fade in to the Olympic bell and the Olympic rings
with clouds in the background and includes brief cuts to the



<B></B>



F&uuml;hrer as well as opening ceremonial parades into the stadium,
featuring in particular the teams of Japan and Italy with hands raised
in the Hitler salute. While Hitler and the Party are indeed present in
<I>Wunschkonzert, </I>they do not play an overbearing or even prominent
role in the film as a whole. One sees pictures in the background or
swastikas on the margins.

<P>
Koch's involvement in the Spanish Civil War as a member of the Condor
Legion is also treated through vague allusions to a secret mission,
soldiers lined up for inspection before departure, high praise for the
Luftwaffe, brief shots of ter raids, etc. Thus "History" is found
on the edges of <I>Wunschkonzert </I>and in moments of digression from
the main narrative--in documentary footage of the invasion of Poland,
in an isolated battle scene in which the good son who plays Beethoven is
killed saving his comrades, in a bombing raid in which Koch is shot down
and Winkler wounded through anti-aircraft ter flak. History is there,
but it clearly remains subordinated to the larger story of the film.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 While it lends the movie a sense of contemporary events--mobilization,
 calls to duty, heroic commitment to the Fatherland, etc.--what we are
 really getting here is history with a small "h": the history of the
 little people who make war possible and the politics of a government
 which is creating another mode of togetherness and community. It is a
 history of private life which, unlike the alienated separations of the
 older bourgeois order, will be organized into a harmony of the home
 and state.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P>
Yet as much as the message of <I>Wunschkonzert </I>is ultimately a
conventionally "political" one, it is the politics of entertainment
which is really writing the master text and gaining the upper hand. As
Goebbels himself was to point out on numerous occasions:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
At a time in which the entire nation is burdened with such heavy cares,
entertainment is from the perspective of state politics of special
value. . . . A national leadership that wishes to be worthy of such a
name has as its first and foremost duty to stand by its people. In this
regard, the film is one of the most valuable means by which individual
Germans are able to beautify those few non-work hours that they have
left for refreshing their spiritual powers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Goebbels does not use the word escapism here, yet the implication is there
and the developing policy clearly followed along these lines. While the
beginning of the war years brought a repoliticizing of film in its focus
on the subject of war, <I>Wunschkonzert </I>as well as another highly
popular film of 1942 entitled <I>Die gro&szlig;e Liebe </I>(The Great
Love) are classic examples of how the codes of Hollywood love comedies
were used to sweeten the pill. For instance, the genre that comes most
immediately to mind for <I>Wunschkonzert </I>is that of the separation
love story as screwball comedy, represented most obviously in Leo
McCarey's film <I>Love Affair </I>of 1939, starring Charles Boyer and
Irene Dunne, which was remade as <I>An Affair to Remember </I>in 1957
(with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr) and <I>Love Affair </I>(with Warren
Beatty and Annette Bening) in 1994. Looking beneath the thematic surface
of war, Reich, Olympic games, and <I>Volksgemeinschaft, </I>one finds
at a deeper structural



<B></B>



 level a powerful homology between the two films in the narrative rhythms
 generated by the deferred desires of unconsummated love. If lack is the
 driving force that motivates the events and propels the narrative of any
 film, <I>Wunschkonzert </I>and <I>Love Affair </I>display remarkably
 similar patterns in the way that system operates in the denied and
 finally consummated love of the major res.

<P>
In <I>Love Affair, </I>of course, there is nothing remotely political
or even socially relevant put forth as the reason for the separation
and delayed reconciliation of the two lovers. The jaded Michel Marnay
and the younger, but equally skeptical Terry McCay--both about to enter
marriages of convenience with wealthy suitors--meet on an ocean liner
headed for New York City and, after a flurry of cynical banter and
comic repartee, suddenly fall wildly in love. Rather than simply run
off together and get married, however, they decide to put themselves on
probation by separating for six months in order to determine whether they
are worthy of their love. Worthiness, in this context it seems, is being
defined by the protestant work ethic, for during their period of delay,
Michel works as a sign painter and Terry sings in nightclubs. On her way
to the appointed marriage rendezvous, Terry suffers a tragic accident,
ending up in the hospital and leaving poor Michel to wait in vain for
her arrival. Completely in the dark as to why she didn't show up, Michel
assumes he has been left in the lurch and the separation continues--almost
unbearably--until they finally manage to find each other again.

<P>
Without arguing that <I>Wunschkonzert </I>was directly influenced by
<I>Love Affair</I>--I certainly have no evidence that it was--let me
suggest two key dimensions of the Hollywood model as revealed therein
which might be seen to undergo an interesting reinscription in this
German film of the same period. Central to both films is the obvious
theme of separation, deferred gratification, and final restitution. Both
narratives are driven by an insatiate desire to restore to balance and
harmony an initial love idyll that has been torn asunder by unforeseen
events. Yet the differences between the two are also significant. The
American film attributes the failure to consummate first to a whim of fate
(the tragic accident) and then to a not very well motivated stubbornness
of pride on Terry's part in refusing to locate Michel and inform him of
what has transpired. <I>Wunschkonzert </I>in contrast, would subordinate
the whims, desires and actions of individuals to the larger mapping of
<I>volkish </I>identity and the goals of the fatherland. Herbert Koch is
about to go to Hamburg for his appointed rendezvous with Inge, only to be
called once more to duty. Without batting an eyelash he rushes off to do
battle over the Atlantic. "Duty is Duty" <I>(Dienst ist Dienst) </I>he
is heard to mutter under his breath as he runs out the door. Rather
than a failure of will, this act is coded as yet another proof of his
supreme devotion to a higher cause. Only when the time is right on a
larger scale will they or can they be reunited.

<P>
And there is also the matter of humor and slapstick in the two films. In
<I>Love Affair, </I>Michel and Terry are shown initially as superficial,
non-serious types: the comedy and screwball antics serve to contrast and
highlight their shift to seriousness as lovers and as working, engaged
people, as well as the film's potential shift toward seriousness as
melodramatic tragedy. In <I>Wunschkonzert </I>the comedy serves above all



<B></B>



to distract from the seriousness of war. The comic performances within
the framework of the radio program, as well as the playfulness and
antics in working out the main love plot and various subplots, serve to
fold the invasions of foreign countries, the violence and death of air
and ground warfare, into the inexorable flow toward the comedic happy
end. The national domestication of the <I>Volk </I>is also in part the
domestication of world war.

<P>
In an article written about <I>Wunschkonzert </I>shortly before its
premiere in 1940, Nazi critic Florian Kienzl uses the film to propound the
theory that "the episodic gains importance in films about the present day
by reflecting the <I>Volksgemeinschaft </I>as a collection of individual
destinies." Where traditional dramatic and cinematic representations have
tended to neglect the smaller roles, often casting them with inexperienced
actors while playing up the centrality of the lead actors, films like
<I>Wunschkonzert </I>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Kienzl's argument reveals two paradigmatic forms of Nazi cooptation. The
first is that of a left-wing, even Brechtian oriented aesthetics by a
populist cultural politics based on volk rather than class. In the name of
a more epic focus upon "episodic res," films like <I>Wunschkonzert
</I>are seen to realign (if not radically decenter) the privileged
individuals of the main plot in a call for an "imaginary world" made up
of "many destinies." In Nazi discourse, the word destiny is often used
in place of the word individual; just as "difference" and "conflict" are
thematized at the same moment they are said to be subsumed and transcended
into a greater whole: "The new contemporary film, this mirror of a folk
which consensually unites in service to the <I>Vaterland, </I>has created
a form which grants to every performer <I>[Darsteller] </I>an equal task
in the service of art."

<P>
Kienzl's representation of the role of film within a modern culture
industry is equally revealing: the Hollywood seamless narrative, while not
completely abandoned, becomes reconred within a larger discursive
complex that would acknowledge the centrality of the stars and the
main plot, while simultaneously valorizing "the richness of the events
revolving around this little kernel" as being "just as important, if
not more important." As a corrective to this position, it should not be
forgotten that the highly successful marketing campaign for this film over
the one-year period prior to its release in December of 1940 was aimed
explicitly and repeatedly at the drawing power of the two lead actors;
and that Ilse Werner and Carl Raddatz both dramatically enhanced their
careers because of their starring roles and, I would argue, the centrality
of the main narrative in <I>Wunschkonzert. </I>As is well known,



<B></B>



Werner's initial reluctance to accept the part was overruled by an adamant
Goebbels, who saw in her the "sympathetic prototype of the refreshing,
modern woman," a re who would help bind this disparate film together
through her combination of the girl-next-door look (Werner was nineteen
at the time of the film) and the allure of a modern star.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P>
Having discussed the importance of the Hollywood model for the reworking
of political messages in the <I>Wunschkonzert, </I>let us conclude now
with some final words about the role of mass culture more generally in
the Third Reich during this period. Clearly what became particularly
significant strategically for the regime with the beginning of the
war was the use of popular cultural forms--film, radio, popular music,
sports--in order to garner support at a time of crisis. For instance, the
brief appearance of the clarinet jazz band in <I>Wunschkonzert </I>can be
viewed today as both a form of cooptation as well as a trope thematizing
a forbidden and potentially subversive history in the Third Reich. What
was called Jewish jazz or Negro jazz, or <I>"Volk</I>-alien Americanism,"
much of which had come into Germany via Hollywood musicals and comedy,
was officially banned in German radio after 1935. While this prohibition
was also meant for the recording industries and public nightlife, there
was in fact a surge in the enjoyment of American music in the late
thirties. Music by Tommy Dorsey, Coleman Hawkins, Count Basie, Artie
Shaw, and Fats Waller was distributed by the major record companies,
even after the outbreak of the war.

<P>
Nazi efforts to combat this "swing bacillus" ranged from periodic,
mostly unsuccessful attempts at prohibition, on the one hand, and a
more concentrated strategy in the area of public broadcasting to replace
it with what Goebbels himself called "quality entertainment music," on
the other.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 And this is precisely what we see being presented in the
 "Wunschkonzert." As highly watered down, often sentimentalized or
 kitschified variations of high swing, it was intended to meet the
 need for popular music, and in so doing also to counter or at least
 neutralize the infiltration of the more sophisticated forms of New
 Orleans Jazz and Benny Goodman swing that were being broadcast into
 Germany via Radio Luxembourg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P>
"Light entertainment music" then was just another form of
domestication. Like the reinscription of Hollywood film and the
theologizing of the radio, its ultimate purpose was to utilize the
modes of a modern culture industry in the remaking of the Reich as a
national family. The film <I>Wunschkonzert </I>brings together a number
of differing media working intertextually to support the cause. In
his bestselling book entitled <I>We Begin the "Wunschkonzert" for the
Armed Forces, </I>Heinz Goedecke, the creator and moderator for the
"Wunschkonzert," tells the illustrated story of the program.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Published in 1940 to dovetail with the appearance of the film, several
 of the anecdotes are renditions of the plot and subplot of the movie;
 just as a number of the photographs of stars from stage, screen, and
 music hall who have frequented the program also appear in the film. As
 one of the most successful productions of the Nazi public sphere, the
 "Wunschkonzert," in all of its permutations, was an entertainment
 <I>Gesamtkunstwerk </I>(total art work) that would anticipate
 developments for years to come.

B&eacute;la Bal&aacute;zs, writing in the 1920s, declared, "At present
a new discovery, a new machine, is at work to turn the attention of men
back to a visual culture and give them new faces."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 This claim exemplifies an almost forgotten utopian tradition of
 film theory, one that saw cinema not only as a new art form or a new
 language, but as a new instrument of knowledge. For theorists such
 as Bal&aacute;zs, the motion picture camera had the ability not only
 to capture reality, but to penetrate it as a new instrument of the
 visible which had a revelatory mission. We could call this potential for
 uncovering new visual knowledge the gnostic (from gnosis, knowledge)
 mission of cinema. For Bal&aacute;zs and other utopian theorists,
 the gnostic potential of the cinema was especially evident in the
 conjunction of the cinematic device of the close-up and the subject of
 the human face:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is the "microphysiognomics" of the close-up that have given us this
subtle play of feature, almost imperceptible yet also so convincing. The
invisible face behind the visible has made its appearance. . .
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
One could find parallel quotes from other utopian theorists of the
1920s (as well as parallel ideas in Benjamin's somewhat later essay,
"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"), such as Vertov
("a shot of the banker will only be true if we can tear the mask from
him, if behind the mask we can see the thief") or Jean Epstein ("I am
sure . . . that if a high speed film were made of an accused person
during his interrogation, then beyond his words, the truth would appear,
unique, evident, written out").
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>




<P>
I would like to use this detour into film theory to highlight something
about the origins of cinema and this overdetermined fascination with
the close-up and the human face. In earlier canonical accounts of
film history, the close-up transformed cinema from a mere means of
reproduction into a unique art form, a transformation often attributed to
D. W. Griffith. Not only is this account discredited on factual grounds
(Griffith did not invent the close-up, and in fact it occurs rather
infrequently in the films he made for the Biograph Company, which are
generally seen as the foundation of his later film style), it also
obscures the complex archeology of the facial close-up in early cinema.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 A close examination of this archeology underscores the key role that
 the gnostic view of cinema played in both the invention and the form
 of early cinema.

<P>
Behind the gnostic impulse that motivates the invention and the practice
of early cinema lurk ambiguous relations woven among visuality,
technology, knowledge, representation, and entertainment in modern
culture. Uncovering the role that capturing the face played in both cinema
and its antecedents traces a saraband between seeing and knowing within
the new visual terrain opened up by photographic technology, which could
not only reproduce human eyesight but exceed it. At the center of this
re lies the expressive human face whose relation to knowledge and
communication forms a central preoccupation of Western culture, serving
as a pivot between individuality and typicality, expression and destiny,
body and soul. The attempt to bring photography, and especially motion
photography, to bear on this most polysemous of human objects reveals
a crisis in understanding visual representation beneath a proclaimed
confidence.

<P>
It is well known that close framings of human faces appear at the origin
of cinema. The early Edison kinetosocope films <I>Fred Ott's Sneeze

</I>(shot in 1894) and the <I>May Irwin Kiss </I> frame res
at the waist in a manner that clearly emphasizes the transformations
of their faces as they perform simple biological actions. Even earlier,
one of the first cinematic or protocinematic apparatuses was fashioned
by George Demen&yuml; in 1891 precisely to obtain a moving image of the
human face (and especially the mouth as it spoke) in order to aid in
teaching deaf children to speak.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The Edison and Demen&yuml; motion pictures may seem to diverge
 sharply in purpose and audience (education versus entertainment;
 a small, specialized audience versus a mass one), but I would claim
 that they are in fact dialectically interrelated. Early cinema, whether
 designed as entertainment, pedagogical tool, or instrument of scientific
 investigation, maintained an important relation to the gnostic impulse,
 although often operating as parody.

The gradual perfection of still photography stimulated the pursuit
of visual phenomena that might otherwise slip below the threshold
of conscious observation and opened up new possibilities of visual
knowledge. A continual attempt to make photography ever more sensitive
to the ephemeral and instantaneous events of physical nature was a major
motivation for cinema's invention and perfection. Early cinema owes its
gradual technical realization to this gnostic impulse driving the work
of Muybridge, Marey, Londe, Demen&yuml;, and others. Beyond the technical
invention of


<B></B>


photography, the origin of this impulse lies in a redefinition of the
role of visual evidence and new methods for investigating the visual
world. The successive ways the human face was categorized, investigated,
and visualized in the pursuit of knowledge provides one way of tracing
this gnostic impulse through to the cinema.

<P>
But the study of the face possesses its own history, as well as its own
ambivalent relation to systems and methods of knowledge. Bal&aacute;zs's
term "microphysiologies" invokes (with the added precision of "micro") the
somewhat antiquated term "physiognomy," a science of facial classification
that had been basically discredited by the twentieth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In many ways the decline of this pseudo-evidence paralleled the growth
 in new methods of visual observation, such as photography. Physiognomy
 has its roots in texts from antiquity attributed to Aristotle and
 Pythagoras which trace the relation between physical appearance and
 character, a practice which ultimately derives from magical forms
 of interpretation and divination such as chiromancy. It founds its
 most influential formulation in the work of Giovanni Battista della
 Porta at the end of the sixteenth century in which the shape of the
 elements of the human face were interpreted by a series of analogies
 to animals, the elements, and the stars within a neoplatonic cosmic
 system. In this system of resemblances and affinities, the human face
 took on meaning by a series of metaphors which joined man's physical
 appearance to the powers which rule his soul and destiny via emblematic
 animals (e.g., facial resemblance to a lion indicates strength and hot
 temper) as well as the astral and planetary influences of astrology. As
 an exemplar of magical thinking, physiognomy worked on the basis of
 visual resemblance, tracing, as Foucault describes it, similitudes as
 "visual marks of invisible analogies."

At the beginning of the modern age (and under the direct influence
of Descartes), physiognomy became reinterpreted as a guide to visual
representation in the arts, detouring from a means of knowing man's
destiny to a system of aesthetic signification. The work of Charles
Le Brun, first painter to Louis XIV, <I>Conf&eacute;rence sur
l'expression</I>


<B></B>


<I> g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et particuli&egrave;re </I>from 1688 which
assembled physiognomic principles as a method for the proper way for
painters to portray emotion and character through facial expression,
dealt both with facial structure, the traditional domain of physiognomy,
and the more transient passions, the domain of facial expression rather
than type. His discussion of the passions is modeled on Descartes's last
work, <I>The Passions of the Soul </I>, providing drawings for
each of the simple and complex passions as Descartes had outline them,
understanding his task in terms of Cartesian relations between mind and
body: "Whatever causes passion in the soul creates also some action in
the body. It is necessary to know which are the actions of the body that
express those passions and what action is."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 In doing this, however, he placed himself in unacknowledged opposition
 to Descartes's own declaration that facial expressions are difficult
 to discern as signs of the passions and, being easily feigned, are
 often misleading.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Le Brun's discussion of physiognomy, the structure of the face as a sign
 of character rather than as expression of passion, further developed
 traditional analogies between human faces and those of animals and the
 qualities they represented (see <A HREF="4.1gunning_2.html"> 2</A>). As Patrizia Magli says, "In
 his links with ancient traditions, and in his merging them with more
 innovative trends, Le Brun both fell behind and preceded his own times."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P>
Physiognomy entered into the age of reason and sensibility (and strongly
influenced both realist and romantic aesthetics of the nineteenth
century) through the famous <I>Physiognomische Fragmente </I>of the
Swiss theologian Johann Caspar Lavater, first published in 1775.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Basically a further systematization of the ancient tradition, Lavater's
 work no longer approached physiognomy as divination, but, developing Le
 Brun's understanding of body as the expression of the soul, presented
 the science as a means of deciphering the mysterious inner world through
 bodily signs.

<P>
Existing on the other side of Descartes's split between the mind and
body, the Romantics believed Lavater's physiognomy reunited mind and
body in an act of symbolic reading, as Novalis's notes on physiognomy
reveal: "'The religious essence of physiognomy. The divine and infinitely
meaningful hieroglyphs of each human body . . . . The way in which these
hieroglyphs have their occasional moments of revelation'" (<I>PEN,</I>
102). The Romantics also recognized Lavater's method as revealing the
unique qualities of each individual physiognomy, analyzing each face as a
combination of individual elements rather than as a master table of
analogies. Lavater's physiognomy exerted as much influence on aesthetics
as on scientific discourse, and was


<B></B>


directly responsible for the increased popularity of the silhouette as a
mode of representation. Not only did the silhouette accurately capture the
facial profile so important in Lavater's method, its indexical process
of production--directly tracing the shadow of its subject--announced
the importance of new visual technologies in sciences of observation,
directly anticipating photography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P>
While the tradition of physiognomy is complex, one can see a consistent
drift in its conceptions as it moves from traditional systems of occult
knowledge to a modern discourse with at least pretenses to being a
science. Physiognomy became less of a system by which one reads an
individual's fate inscribed in facial features through cosmic and
symbolic analogies than a means of observation in which the face is
mobile and expressive, revealing a person's accumulated history as much
as predetermined fate (Lavater emphasized that a person's way of life
could affect his physical appearance).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Features no longer embodied the coded writing of destiny. They spoke
 the language of emotion conveyed through expressions, the changeable
 signifiers of varying moods. The facial traits which reflected character
 served less as predictions of a person's future than as traces left by
 their profession or way of life, less occult symbols than the residue
 of a scientific logic of cause and effect. For instance, the French
 editor of Lavater, Dr. Moreau de la Sarthe, described the physiognomics
 of professions as a reflections of habitual behavior:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Skillful and very experienced surgeons have in their physiognomy a
particular dominant trait, which comes from a habitual movement of
raising the upper lip--which can be attributed the effort they make to
resist the impression caused by the sight of suffering and pain which
they have before their eyes during major operations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
But however systematized and rationalized, physiognomy still carried
a promise of knowledge that verged on the occult. Since our reactions
to faces seem immediate and untutored, physiognomy exemplified the
Romantic concept of universal hieroglyphic language, more intuitive than
analytical, a signifier that, far from being arbitrary, still carried
the surplus value of visual similarity. It is no coincidence that one
of the few attempts at film theory that preceded Bal&aacute;zs's, that
of Vachel Lindsay, declared cinema to be a "hieroglyphic" art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P>
Physiognomy became a popular social science in nineteenth century Paris,
where it provided a visual means to order the diverse and anonymous
masses that surrounded the urban dweller. These typologies of observation
greatly affected the novels of Bal&aacute;zs and the caricatures of
Daumier and Grandville.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 It was suggested that choosing a wife or hiring a servant should
 never be undertaken without the aid of physiognomic analysis. The
 physiognomic studies of Lavater and his disciples became transformed
 into the "physiologies" which appeared as a sort of literary fad in
 the 1840s. Somewhat broadening the physiognomies into a description
 of specific manners and lifestyles, these physiologies outlined the
 various "types" of Parisians, through a somewhat ironical "scientific"
 observation (<I>ACH,</I> 31-9). As Walter Benjamin has indicated,
 these physiologies attempted to reduce classes and professions to stable
 and recognizable stereotypes, reassuring to a petty bourgeois world view:


<B></B>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The long series of eccentric or simple attractive or severe res which
the physiologies presented to the public in character sketches had one
thing in common: they were harmless and of perfect bonhomie. Such a view
of one's fellow man was so remote from experience that there were bound
to be uncommonly weighty motives for it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Weighty indeed. The physiologies were a last gasp of a confidence in
one's ability to sort people into types that not only were stable but
easily recognizable, an attempt that gained urgency as the fluid contours
of a modern world made such methods of classification increasingly
difficult. Balzac, who authored several physiologies, nonetheless was
aware of the new precariousness of sort people into general types. He
bewailed the fact that whereas previously, "the caste system gave each
person a physiognomy which was more important than the individual;
today the individual gets his physiognomy from himself" (<I>AHC,</I>
29-30).

<P>
If the future of such social physiognomy as social science was doomed
by the dissolving of the visual signs of caste, profession, and type
(or their slipping below the threshold of the immediately recognizable),
the extremely individualizing processes of photography allowed for a new
positivist science of observation of the face and its expressions. The
physiologies were accompanied by the growth in the art of caricatures,
which were frequently used to illustrate them. But with the advent of
photography the human face became less a realm described in generalities
(such as Moreau's description of surgeons) than a zone of intense
scrutiny on an individual basis. An anonymous British author writing on
physiognomy in 1861 saw the progress of the science as lying precisely
in its use of photographs:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is equally true that with such portraits and engravings of portraits as
we have had, it is has been utterly impossible to get beyond the nebulous
science of a Lavater. We required the photograph. . . . It must be
remembered that to give a general likeness is one of the easiest strokes
of art. With a half-a-dozen lines the image is complete, as anyone may
see in the million wood-engravings of the day; while at the same time
it would be difficult to gather from these rough sketches, where two
dots go for eyes and a scratch for a mouth, what is the precise anatomy
of any one feature. So while we can accept as in the main truthful the
portraits that have come down to us, it is impossible to place perfect
reliance on any particular lineament.

<P>
In this new method of investigation of the face, rooted in individual
faces and their transient momentary expressions, photography served as
the optimal tool of investigation. From this new empirical perspective,
physiognomy no longer served primarily


<B></B>


 as a guide to aesthetic representation, but demanded the accuracy of
 new mechanical modes of image-making.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P>
A seminal re in this research was G. B. Duchenne de Boulogne. Duchenne
was a founder of neurology in France, the teacher and master of
Jean-Martin Charcot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Duchenne's pioneering work in the classification of neurological
 disorders was often based on his innovative use of electricity to
 stimulate directly muscles and nerves. His use of new technology
 for medical purposes also extended to photography, as he began in
 the 1850s to photograph the debilitating results of neurological
 diseases. He combined electricity and photography in his investigation
 of the mechanism of human facial expression which was published in
 1862. Duchenne wished first of all to accurately map out the muscles of
 the human face which created the common expressions of emotion. Direct
 application of electrodes to the faces of human subjects allowed
 Duchenne to cause involuntary contractions of facial muscles. In this
 way Duchenne literally sculpted expression or grimaces on to the faces
 of his subjects. Photography could fix these momentary contractions
 and allow them to be studied at leisure, to be scrutinized and compared.

<P>
<A NAME="3" HREF="4.1gunning_3.html">
<IMG

SRC="button/4.1gunning_3b.gif"></A>

Duchenne's distance from the earlier physiognomies comes from both his
positivist scientific ambitions and his use of modern technology. Instead
of a permanent physical imprint of fate or character he sought to
understand the face in motion, describing facial expressions as a
mobile muscular phenomenon. This interest in motion set him apart from
Le Brun who, as Duchenne stated, "represented the diverse aspects of
facial expression produced by the emotions but without worrying about
their laws of motion," as well as from Lavater who "entirely omitted
the study of facial expression in movement" (<I>MHFE,</I> 4).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 This interest in the phenomenon of


<B></B>


motion and the belief that the physical effects of motion had laws
indicate Duchenne's place within a modern line of scientific investigation
that would lead directly to the invention of the cinema. What had
seemed contingent and below the threshold of knowledge for the
earlier physiognomists was precisely suited to the possibilities of
new technology. The electrode could affect a facial muscle in isolation
while photography could capture a facial contraction that was much too
brief to be otherwise recorded (see <A HREF="4.1gunning_3.html" NAME="3">
 3</A>). As Duchenne put it:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Skillful artists have tried in vain to represent the faces of my subjects;
for the contractions provoked by the electrical currents are of too short
a duration for an exact reproduction of the expressive lines that develop
on the face to be drawn or painted. Only photography, as truthful as a
mirror, could attain such a desirable perfection. [<I>MHFE,</I> 36]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Since Duchenne's major goal was to identify the muscles and motor
nerves in the face and their role in a variety of expressions, he
literally tried to reveal the "invisible face behind the visible." Yet
for Duchenne, following the Cartesian tradition, facial expression
had another interior--the spirit. "The spirit is thus the source of
expression. It activates the muscles that portray our emotions on the
face with characteristic patterns" (<I>MHFE,</I> 1). But in Duchenne's
experiments the spirit as the motive force of facial expressions was
replaced by the electrode that caused the face involuntarily to "speak
the language of emotions and the sentiments" (<I>MHFE,</I> 1). However
artificial such expressions might be when electrically induced for
purposes of demonstration and investigation, Duchenne had no doubt that
he was investigating a language that was universal and God-given:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the face our Creator was not concerned with mechanical necessity. He
was able in his wisdom or--please pardon this manner of speaking--in
pursuing a divine fantasy, to put any particular muscles into action,
one alone or several muscles together, when he wished the characteristic
signs of the emotions, even the most fleeting, to be written briefly
on man's face. Once this language of facial expression was created, it
sufficed for him to give all human beings the instinctive faculty of
always expressing their sentiments by contracting the same muscles. This
rendered the language universal and immutable. [<I>MHFE,</I> 19]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
But if Duchenne represents a modern scientist devoted to empirical
observation through the use of modern technology rather than a traditional
physiognomist tracing mystical signatures and resemblances, the strong tie
between the study of the face and the codes of aesthetic representation
continue to compel aspects of his work. Duchenne hoped to reformulate
Le Brun's work and provide artists with documentary proof the visual
language of the human emotions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 He divided the photographic plates that illustrated his these into
 "Scientific" and "Aesthetic" sections. In place of his predominantly
 male models imaged in the scientific section, the aesthetic section
 makes use exclusively of a female model, while the close framing of
 the face frequently gives way to dramatic tableaux in which the female
 model is posed in costume with props.


<B></B>

<P>
Duchenne glosses these images with narrative situations that might
explain or specify the emotions he evokes with his electrode. If
somewhat less aggressive in their framing and less agonized in their
facial contortions, these images seem even more bizarre as the electrode
and its manipulator intervene into the stages sets and poses of genre
painting. The photographs display disturbing tensions between the
conventional sentiments and narrative of the poses and scenarios and
a nightmarish scene of a meta-narrative of control and technological
manipulation which the intervening electrode indicates. Further
complicating his simple narratives, Duchenne deconstructs the unified
effect of the facial expression by attempt to create distinct expressions
within different zones of the face. For instance, he describes plate 80:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The young lady photographed in this re is visiting a poor family; we
recognize, from her tender laughter (cover the left side of the face)
or from her kind smile (cover the right side of the face) that she is
touched by the misery and suffering of this unhappy family, and that
this sentiment has inspired an act of charity. [<I>MHFE,</I> 118]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Although Duchenne frequently apologizes for the lack of aesthetic value
and physical beauty of his older male model who appears frequently in
the scientific section of the work, he never explains why he exclusively
uses a female model (whom he describes as neither pretty nor ugly and
mentions was nearly blind) in the aesthetic section.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Undoubtedly a belief that a female model would be more pleasing to
 viewers corresponded with his desire in this section "to please those who
 possess 'a sense of beauty'" (<I>MHFE,</I> 102). However, more deeply
 imbedded cultural conceptions of gender clearly operate here, relating
 the female model not only the aesthetic, but to an atmosphere of drama
 and mystery created by the use of the fictional settings and narrative
 scenarios in this section. Although his experiments in electrically
 creating different expressions on each side of the face appeared in the
 scientific section as well, here it becomes a nearly constant practice,
 as if the conjunction of a woman model and drama led naturally into a
 succession of facial expressions and moods. For instance, his gloss on
 plate 77 describes not only diverse expressions but a typology of female
 desire: "Earthly love at right and celestial love at left. Ecstasy of
 human love, by covering the left half of the face; gentle rapture of
 divine love (ecstasy of St. Teresa), by covering the opposite side"
 (<I>MHFE,</I> 104-5).

This division of the sides of the face into separate expressions became
for Duchenne a means of expressing the ambivalence of a dramatic scene,
as in his extraordinarily revealing discussion of plate 78 (see 
<A HREF="4.1gunning_4.html" NAME="4"> 4</A>),
which he elaborates with a complete drama:

In Plate 78 I wanted to show a little comedy, a scene of coquetry, a
gentleman surprises a lady while she is dressing. On seeing him, her
stance and her look become disapproving (cover the bottom half of her
face). Nevertheless, we note her nudity, which instead of covering she
seems to reveal with a certain affectation. It is the mannered pose of her
hand, which supports a rather overtly revealed bosom. All this betrays
her coquetry. The young man was becoming more audacious, but the words
"get out" pronounced in a


<B></B>


 scornful way by the girl, stop him in his enterprise (see only the
 left side of the lower half of her face). The mocking laughter that
 accompanies the amorous rejection (see the right side of the lower half

 much lower: "The fool, if he had dared . . ." [<I>MHFE,</I> 111-2]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For Duchenne the face was an extremely flexible medium on which the
spirit writes a translatable message of emotions in a language created
by God himself. However, his investigation via an arbitrary stimulation
of the diverse muscles of the face could also produce the face as a
sort of collage in which contrasting emotions occupied different zones
of the face. Duchenne also found that he could produce non-grammatical
expressions which he termed grimaces, "where it was hard, sometimes
nearly impossible, to make any meaningful interpretation" (<I>MHFE,</I>
17). Such grimaces serve only as the noise within his system of facial
expression in which a mask of muscles sculpts the invisible impulses
of the spirit. But the very bizarre nature of Duchenne's aesthetic
section may betray anxiety at the arbitrary expressions he has induced
on the face by substituting electrical impulses for the passions of
the soul. Narrative scenography imposes itself as a means of containing
(though not dispelling) his own intervention, as if familiar situations
and cultural clich&eacute;s of feminine roles provided a context of
ideologically reassuring recognizability necessary to allow the viewer to
see these shocking demonstrations of the human face as the play of muscles
as part of a visible "natural language." In any case, it would seem


<B></B>


that Charcot learned the effectiveness of staging a scenography of female
performers under the dominance of a male "operator" from his master.

Charles Darwin drew heavily on Duchenne in his 1872 study of <I>The
Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. </I>He particularly
praised the use of photography in the investigation of facial expression:
"I have found photographs made by instantaneous process the best means,
as allowing more deliberation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 However, he strongly rejected as contrary to the principles of his theory
 of evolution, any claim that expressions were a language designed by
 the Creator in order to allow humans to communicate, as Duchenne had
 believed. Darwin tried to explain the communicative aspects and the
 forms of expressions through recourse to a deeper history than the
 personal one of habit or profession. Expression provided a link between
 men and animals (see <A HREF="4.1gunning_5.html" NAME="5">
  5</A>). "With mankind some expressions, such as
 the bristling of the hair under the influence of extreme terror, or
 the uncovering of the teeth under that of furious rage, can hardly be
 understood, except on the belief that man once existed in a much lower
 and animal-like condition" (<I>EEMA, </I>12).

<P>
Darwin was probably unaware of the irony of this return to the
most ancient form of physiognomy, the comparison between humans and
animals. However, Darwin's method was historical and evolutionary rather
than analogical, discovering, like most nineteenth century systems of
thought, the traces of the long duree of history on the forms of nature,
rather than the timeless semantic tables of resemblance that guided
della Porta and even Le Brun's physiognomy. But Darwin also sought the
survival of this evolutionary past in the present through a different
sort of analogy. If the investigation of expression led directly to the
extensive evolutionary past of man, he felt it essential to investigate
not only man's animal ancestors, but also human subjects whom he believed
might be closer to this ancestry due to their distance from civilizing
influences, such as the observation of infants--and of the insane--and
of different races of man (<I>EEMA,</I> 13). Darwin's investigation
sought to strip the face of its civilized mask of convention and reveal
a language of expression which derived from the struggle for survival
and various forms of adaptation to environmental or physical forces. But
to understand the laws of the human face a new importance accorded to
faces that were somehow alien to "normal" human behavior. A science


<B></B>


of deviant faces took on a new importance, in contrast to physiognomy's
traditional search for the typical and ideal.

<P>
Facial photographs held a special place in the treatment of the insane,
with Hugh W. Diamond pioneering the use of photographic portraits in both
the study and treatment of the insane. The photographs which Diamond took
at the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum in the 1850s were used not only in
his public lectures on mental illness but in the therapy of patients using
"the effect they [the photographs] produced upon the patients themselves"
to help the progress of their cure (<I>FOM,</I> 21). Diamond's associate
Dr. John Conolly discussed these photographs in 1858 in an article
entitled "Case Studies from the Physiognomy of the Insane," in which he
portrayed these faces as traces of a battle between original character
and the physical effects of mental aberration. The idea of a physiognomy
of the insane had already been described in 1838 by J. E. D. Esquirol who
made whose of drawings of mental patients in order to trace similarities
between them (<I>FOM,</I> 25-72). As Connoly's essay shows, this was
a system of description still indebted to the ancient forms of analogy
and metaphor, but inflected by a modern concern for individual chase
history, clearly showing the influence of Lavater.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Describing a pathetic case of what he termed "suicidal melancholy," he
 portrayed the face as a battleground of emotional struggles:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The features are unrefined; but the wide and high head indicates
intellectual qualities that cultivation might have improved; so as to
control perhaps a now dominating ideality. The copious and disheveled
hair, which we feel sure must be black mingled with grey, is parted with
no care, but straggles in sympathy with the tortured brain. Those many
and curved wrinkles in the brow are not wrinkles of ordinary trouble. The
raised and equally curved eyebrows; the large melancholy, and the uplifted
eyes, declare that the sense is fixed on some image of fear, which no
other eye can detect; and the intensity of the prevalent emotion is
forcibly expressed in all the other parts of the face. The upper eyelids
disappear; the lower are strongly depressed; the muscles of the cheeks
are drawn down, the lower lip being, as it were, spasmodically acted
upon, showing nearly all the front teeth of the lower jaw. The chin has
been scratched and scarred by her own fingernails. The very ears seem
starting forward. Everything bespeaks terror. [<I>FOM,</I> 37]

The face photographed becomes a text to be read by the male doctor
employing a bewildering variety of interpretive means, ranging from
deviation from norms of behavior (the unparted hair), to traces of past
behavior (the scarred chin), through a range of analogies (the hair which
"straggles in sympathy with the tortured brain") to a general sort of
allegorical method which sees the face as "bespeaking terror." These faces
stand primarily as deviant faces, horrifying visual evidence of the mental
sufferings the subjects have undergone. Diamond underscored these aspects
in assembling in one plate four photographs of a woman in different stages
of illness and cure, in which the variety of expression seems perhaps less
remarkable than the variety of clothing which clearly differentiates the
deviant expressions from the controlled face of convention (see 
<A HREF="4.1gunning_6.html"> 6</A>).

<P>
Succeeding decades saw a general adoption of photography for medical and
scientific purposes (the <I>Revue photographique des Hopitaux de Paris,
</I>for instance, was


<B></B>


established in 1869), and towards the end of the century increasingly
short exposure time allowed a relation between photography and the
recording of motion for scientific purposes that moved asymptotitcally
towards the invention of cinema.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
Undoubtedly the most famous and complex use of photography to record
facial movement and expression came from Jean-Martin Charcot and the
<I>Iconographie photographique de la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. </I>In
1878 Charcot, the head physician of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re (a
Parisian charity hospital for women), had installed there a Photographic
Service complete with a glass roofed studio, and a photographic laboratory
(<I>IH,</I> 47).
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Albert Londe, who was placed in charge of the Photographic Service
 in 1884, lauded the gnostic possibilities of photography, describing
 the latest photographic plate as "the true retina of the scientist," a
 means of seeing that could, in fact, be more sensitive than the human
 eye (<I>IH,</I> 35). Charcot's greatest fame came from his description
 and treatment of hysteria. Documenting the behavior of hysterics was
 especially important since this elusive diseases exhibited a scenario
 of behavior rather than clearly isolatable physical symptoms (leading
 frequently to the claim that hysterics are simply malingerers who
 "mimicked" the symptoms of others to gain attention [<I>IH,</I> 36, 39]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Charcot claimed to have discovered predictable patterns to this behavior
 (such as the succession of different physical actions in a consistent
 order which made up the hysterical fit), giving the disease a character
 that could be analyzed and diagnosed.

<P>
Observation was essential to the diagnosis of hysteria and photography
increases this power of observation as well as providing its faithful
record. Charcot had actually


<B></B>


 compared his method to that of photography, declaring: " . . . in truth
 I am absolutely nothing but a photographer; I inscribe what I see."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In diagnostic use medical photography mediated between the
 patient's individual body and the general characteristics of the
 disease. Determining this general aspect, or <I>facies, </I>of a disease
 called for a specific use of photography. As Londe explained:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To determine the <I>facies </I>belonging to each disease, to each illness,
to place it before the eyes of all, this is what photography is capable
of. In certain doubtful or uncertain cases, comparing photographs taken
in diverse places or at quite different times allows one to be sure of
the identity of the illness of diverse patients whom one has not had
under one's care at the same time. This has been accomplished with great
success by M. Charcot and the <I>facies </I>belonging to this or that
illness of the central nervous system is now well-known.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Visual demonstration as well as diagnosis played a key role in Charcot's
investigation of hysteria. Both were evident at his famous public
"Tuesday Lessons" in which women patients and their symptoms were
paraded before an audience made up of interns, doctors (such as the
Viennese physician Sigmund Freud--who later overturned Charcot's theory
of hysteria--attending the lectures on a travel grant) and invited
members of high society (including such luminaries as Henri Bergson,
Emile Durkheim, Guy de Maupassant and Sarah Bernhardt).
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 In these sessions Charcot not only displayed the symptoms of his female
 patients, but experimentally influenced their behavior through hypnosis,
 drugs, or various forms of physical manipulation (including, during
 photographic sessions, sudden exposure to a magnesium flash, as Ulrich
 Baer has stressed).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<P>
But the <I>facies </I>revealed by these means of investigation and
observation was the paradoxical typicality of the deviant. Charcot
used hypnosis to provoke effects similar to those his teacher Duchenne
had induced by electrical current, occasionally invoking contradictory
impulses within a patient so that "the subject found herself in some way
divided in two" (<I>IH,</I> 228). Charcot also on occasion used electrodes
to effect his hysterics, but found that such force was unnecessary to
provoke facial contractions. Slight pressure from a simple metal rod
would produce the same sorts of facial contractions Duchenne had induced
by more powerful means.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Sudden loud noises, flashes of electrical light, or dramatic gestures
 on the part of the doctor could produce extraordinary physical results,
 from cataleptic postures to violent seizures.

<P>
The extremely theatrical nature of Charcot's demonstrations and
treatments, as well as his use of hypnosis, led to widespread suspicion
and criticism of his methods and conclusions. Charcot's critics portrayed
him as the histrionic impresario of his mimicking hysterics, inducing
symptoms through suggestion and training his subjects (knowingly or
unwittingly) to perform for himself and his invited audiences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
The collapse of Charcot's view of hysteria led to alternate scenarios,
most obviously that of psychoanalysis, and one can see Charcot's
highly visualized and dramatic performances as an attempt to give this
paradoxical disease a recognizable visual face, an attempt, on the cusp
of modernity, to tie once more the act of seeing to the act of knowing.

The role of photography in all of this is perhaps more complex than
previous treatments, such as Didi-Huberman's, have indicated, as
insightful as they have been. Charcot's patients and their symptoms
were paraded before the camera as well as before interns and the
public. These photographs were published in the three volumes of the
<I>Iconographie photographique de la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re </I>in
1876, 1877 and 1879. After a significant hiatus, the photographic series
reappeared in a new format in 1888 as <I>Nouvelle Iconographie de la
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. </I>These photographs include a number of
facial close-ups, although framing including the posture and contortions
of the full body predominates. However, in contrast to Diamond and other
earlier photographers of mental illness there is no attempt to create
a physiognomy of madness here. The <I>facies </I>of hysteria demands a
specific etiology of an elusive disease. The contorted faces of women
were fit into a pattern which made hysteria conceivable as a disease and
visibly recognizable. Londe described the importance of facial close-up
photography (see <A HREF="4.1gunning_7.html">
 7</A>) in capturing the characteristics of the disease:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Certain modifications of the face which by themselves were not recognized
as constituting in isolation a clear indication of a particular illness
took on a very great importance when they were found over and over in
similar sufferers. Unless one happened by chance to have patients show
the same expressions at the same time, they might go unnoticed. However,
with close-up photographs of them, one can make comparisons between a
number of examples and deduce the typical modifications of different
aspects. [<I>IH, </I>52]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Londe here perhaps knowingly recalls Bertillon's system of criminal
photography which allowed the photographs of suspects and convicts to
be compared in terms of physical characteristics and the identity of
malefactors be established. However, as


<B></B>


in the case of Bertillon, we see that the satisfaction of pure visual
recognition remains elusive. No one photograph could finger the guilty
party or portray the <I>facies </I>of the disease. The act of recognition
relies on comparison, and knowledge resides not in the single photograph,
but within a vast photographic archives, cross indexed by systems of
classification.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P>
The recent biographers of Albert Londe, Denis Bernard and Andr&eacute;
Gunthert have questioned Charcot's personal devotion to photography as a
method of medical investigation. They point out that the <I>Iconographie
</I>was instigated by Desir&eacute; Bourneville and that its hiatus
coincided with Bourneville's departure from Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re
for Bicetre in 1879.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 They also claim Bourneville rather than Charcot was the driving force
 behind photography at Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, and that the photographic
 service as well as the <I>Iconographie </I>fell into stagnation until
 Londe took charge in 1884.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 From this perspective, Charcot's self-identification with the
 photographer may indicate he felt his own gaze was sufficient as the
 major device of visual investigation, rather than the photograph. As
 Bernard and Gunthert indicate, "The gaze <I>(regard) </I>and the
 image are not synonymous" (<I>IRAL,</I> 111). Photographic sessions at
 Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re took place without Charcot present, and the
 "most serious rival of the photographic plate remained the clinician's
 gaze" (<I>IRAL,</I> 62).

<P>
Londe, a devoted advocate of medical photography (whose book on the
subject was published in 1893), understood that a photograph, in order
to become scientific had be placed within a system.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Each photograph had to find its place within a series. Besides
 the comparisons that a physician could make by rummaging through
 the <I>Iconographie, </I>Londe also explored the possibilities of
 serial photography to indicate the succession of actions typical of
 hysterical attacks. The need to obtain successive photographs led Londe
 to photographic inventions which brought him to the cusp of cinema,
 including a number of multi-lens cameras, capable of taking a series of
 separate images in rapid succession. His crowning apparatus possessed
 twelve lenses and was therefore able to take at brief intervals twelve
 images of an ongoing action.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Such images inscribed a temporal progression into photography. Still
 photography in the late nineteenth century had gained a scientific
 and gnostic role not only through its iconic resemblance and indexical
 reliability, but through its increasing mastery of the increments of
 time and its ability to freeze an instantaneous event, such as a sudden
 facial expression or the convulsions of an hysteric's limbs. The ambition
 of nineteenth century science to discover not only the characteristic
 lineaments of the face as interpreted by physiognomy, but the laws of
 motion and the temporal processes of the body and the face led directly
 to the technical invention of the cinema.

<P>
As a leader in bringing photography (and especially scientific and medical
photography) to the attention of the public, Londe knew the motion
analysis photographs of Eadweard Muybridge and the chronophotography
of Etienne Jules Marey very well. A pioneer in the development of
instantaneous photography, Londe was an enthusiast about the scientific
possibilities of new photographic techniques.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Not only chronophotography (the taking of series of stills in rapid
 succession to analyze the phases of a motion), but stereoscopic three
 dimensional photography were


<B></B>


employed by Londe to capture the symptoms of medical patients.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 In his drive to master the analysis of space and time through photography
 Londe seems to have created a counterforce to his subjects' bodies out
 of control--attempting to master on the level of technology what defied
 orderly behavior. But, like Marey, he, at least initially, found the
 <I>Cinematographe, </I>the device for projecting motion pictures to
 create an illusion of movement, a mere novelty bereft of scientific
 interest.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 In place of photographic processes which could fix and analyze temporal
 processes in order to reveal phenomenon otherwise difficult to perceive,
 motion pictures seem simply to reproduce the experience of the normal
 eye witness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P>
For Londe, scientific photography mastered its visual subject, moving
beyond the simple resemblance and illusion of motion that Lumi&egrave;re's
<I>Cinematographe </I>offered. Through still photography's control of
time, the hysteric fit was frozen, delivered to the physician's gaze with
movement tamed. We find here, at the moment of the invention of cinema, a
dilemma which thwarts any simple tracing of a linear progression in film's
genealogy. The gnostic impulse pushes towards cinema's control of time
and motion, but also expresses suspicions of its illusory potential. At
this critical point, the bifurcation between cinema as a device of mass
entertainment and its use as a scientific tool becomes evident, as the
conflict between Marey and his assistant Demen&yuml; dramatized. However,
one should not assume too quickly an absolute separation. The two impulses
continue to infect each other, indicating less a parting of the ways based
on principle than a crisis of representation based on the illusory power
of technological imagery and a new mimesis of time. Cinema's destiny as
a modern technological popular medium derives from this conflict, and
continues to show its effects for at least its first decade.

How then are we to understand Londe turning his experimental photography
on nonscientific subjects, photographing acrobats from the Hippodrome
in stereo in 1887 and the tight rope walking act of Mlle. Barenco of
the Noveau Cirque in 1893 (see <A HREF="4.1gunning_8.html"> 8</A>)?
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Clearly such subjects were ideal for demonstrating the new powers
 of photography to capture action. The twelve images of la Barenco
 demonstrate her delicate control of balance in a manner that the naked
 eye, absorbed in the ongoing moment-to-moment drama of her act, might
 not catch. But the sequence also anticipates the strong link that early
 cinema, as a popular art, will forge with vaudeville, circus and the
 attractions of popular culture.

<P>
If Marey and Muybridge stand as the best known and most influential
of cinema's scientific progenitors, the focus of chronophotography
on the face owes more to the experiments of Marey's assistant Georges
Demen&yuml; whose attempt to bring the motion picture into the realm
of show business (even before the Lumi&egrave;re brothers), led to the
loss of his position as a researcher. Discussing his cinematic work some
years later, Demen&yuml; still presented himself as a savant rather than
a showman, claiming that for him, "the cinema was only a means of study
momentarily rendering me the same service that a microscope provides
for the anatomist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Demen&yuml; served as Marey's <I>preparateur </I>and trusted assistant
 from 1881, when he had approached the renown physiologist and
 investigator of the science of movement about the application


<B></B>


 of Marey's methods to a system of gymnastic training Demen&yuml; had
 been perfecting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Demen&yuml; oversaw the construction and subsequent functioning of
 Marey's <I>Station Physiologique. </I>In 1891 Marey turned over to him a
 project brought to the physiologist by the director of the National Deaf
 Mute Institute to study the physical mechanics of speech. The director
 hoped that a series of chronophotographs showing the positions of lips
 and tongue during speech might aid deaf mutes learning to lip read and,
 hopefully, to speak.

For this project Demen&yuml; substituted a much closer camera position
than had been customary for Marey's chronophotographic studies of the body
in motion, framing speaking subjects above mid-chest. However, since the
aim was not only analytical but synthetic--helping deaf mutes to imitate
the processes of speech as well as observe them--devising a means of
presenting these photographs in such a manner as to reconstitute their
motion became a primary issue in a way it not been for Marey's earlier
motion studies. Attempting to create the illusion of a human face in
motion, speaking, brought Demen&yuml; even closer to the cinema than
Londe had ventured. While both Muybridge and Marey had also employed
various means of reconstituting motion


<B></B>


from their analytical photographs, Demen&yuml; was certainly a pioneer
in the production of motion pictures, even if his technology was heavily
indebted to his mentor. He cut and pasted the images captured on the
chronophotographic strips around the edge of a circular wheel based on
an earlier "philosophical toy" for the production of the illusion of
motion, the phenakistiscope (<I>PT, </I>176). Two initial series of
images were produced, both with Demen&yuml; himself (his eyes closed
from the blinding light necessary for the brief exposure) speaking the
emblematic phrases, "I Love You" and "Vive la France!" (See 
<A HREF="4.1gunning_9.html"> 9</A>.) When
this device was presented to the public in 1892 (three years before the
<I>Cinematographe </I>and a year before the first public demonstration of
Edison's kinetoscope), it generated a fervent interest which overwhelmed
the pedagogical purposes for which it was designed.

Demen&yuml;, long concerned about financial security, hoped that this
interest in his moving photographs could be exploited commercially. He
patented his apparatus, which he called the "phonoscope," demonstrated
it at the 1892 Photographic Exposition, and was approached by carnival
operators with offers to exploit it as an entertainment device. For
Demen&yuml;, however, the possibilities of the phonoscope were firmly
linked to the image it provided of the human face in motion. He described
his new invention as a "living portrait," saying, "The future will
replace the static photograph, fixed in its frame, with the animated
portrait that will be given life


<B></B>


with the turn of a wheel. The expression of physiognomy will be presented
as the voice is preserved by the phonograph" (<I>PT,</I> 180). The
living portrait, Demen&yuml; believed, would deliver the traditional
family portrait from an effect of mummification, allowing it "to live
again like a veritable apparition" (<I>HCC,</I> 168).

<P>
Although the device which presented the moving image was of Demen&yuml;'s
design (although based on the traditional phenakistiscope), the
chronophotographic camera which took the images was Marey's invention and
a growing conflict over the commercial exploitation of the phonoscope
led to a bitter rupture between the savant and his protegee. While
the issue here revolved around what Marey perceived as Demen&yuml;'s
appropriation of his work, the prospect of marketing chronophotography
as a fairground attraction undoubtedly further annoyed Marey. Marey's
deep and abiding suspicion of the fallibility of human vision was even
more intense than Londe's and his lack of interest in the illusion of
motion strongly expresses the scientific disdain of motion pictures as
betrayals of the possibilities of scientific photography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Demen&yuml; continued to attempt to make a commercial success of his
 invention and, adapting it to flexible film, designed both a camera and
 a projector, setting up his own studio where he filmed living portraits
 as well as other subjects. After approaching the Lumi&egrave;res about
 a partnership and getting a cold response, Demen&yuml; eventually sold
 the rights to his patents to Louis Gaumont and returned to his first
 passion, gymnastic and physical training.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

<P>
We find among the films that Demen&yuml; shot before the dissolving of
his company, cataloged by Laurent Mannoni, one which Mannoni entitles
"Demen&yuml; making a grimace." Mannoni adds this brief speculative
description, "An illustration perhaps intended to represent two different
human expressions, as Le Brun had done in the 17th Century in his work
<I>The Expression of the Passions." </I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Demen&yuml;'s interest in the motion picture of the face, clearly
 embraced not only the "living portrait" but the investigation of
 expression that extends from Della Porta, to the grimaces of the facial
 expression films to come.

Given the seeming interruption of the scientific tradition with the
triumph of actual motion pictures, can we assert that early cinema still
owes something to the gnostic impulse? While the cinematic devices of
Edison and the Lumi&egrave;re brothers owe a great deal to the technical
path traced by their scientific predecessors, does the illusion of
cinema invert and betray their own anti-illusionary impulse, as Marey
and Londe suspected? Does the synthesis of motion supply nothing but a
parlor trick, limited to a dubious entertainment value, and bereft of
scientific interest because it relies on a simple visual mimesis, rather
than the scientific possibilities of


<B></B>


analysis and manipulation of time and motion? While the road in the
development of cinema does fork here, the interchanges between the gnostic
impulse and entertainment continue to assert themselves, something that
becomes clearer if we maintain our broader view of the gnostic impulse
as preceding modern science and inherent in such metaphor-based systems
as physiognomy.

<P>
The scientific impulses that gave birth to modern science derive from
a more primal curiosity, that <I>curiositas </I>which was condemned
as a sin against the faith by St. Augustine in the third century, a
fascination with the unusual which the theologian saw as the root of
both a sideshow theatricality and unseemly concern with the nature of
God's universe, in other words, the root of both popular entertainment
and scientific investigation.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Because of this disease of curiosity monsters and anything out of the
ordinary are put on display in our theaters. From the same motives
men proceed to investigate the workings of nature which is beyond our
ken--things which it does no good to know and which men only want to
know for the sake of knowing.

<P>
The monumental work of Hans Blumenberg has traced the gradual overturning
of this theological stricture and the eventual


<B></B>


 validation of curiosity as a positive force and power of man in
 the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, supplying one of the major
 transformations in the legitimation of a modern secular world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 In the more immediate era of modernity, the nineteenth and twentieth
 centuries, the exploiting and exercising of such curiosity outside of
 the disciplines of actual science constituted a major impulse of popular
 entertainment, and operated explicitly in the presentation of motion
 pictures as an show business novelty. While the pseudo-educational
 and scientific claims of Barnum's nineteenth-century museum of
 curiosities were partly a response to American puritanical suspicion
 of entertainment, they also tapped a growing popular curiosity
 about scientific and technological innovations. While claims of
 scientific value could serve as camouflage for simple forms of popular
 entertainment, a peculiarly modern exploitation of curiosity may also
 introduce new regimes of aesthetic appreciation, ones which conflict
 sharply with traditional modes of contemplation and absorption, revealing
 parallels with modernist attacks on traditional aesthetics. Therefore,
 we need to question how thoroughly illusionistic the earliest exhibition
 of motion pictures were, and in what ways they may have continued the
 scientific probing of illusionistic coherence, but now for the sake of
 curiosity rather than coherent knowledge.

<P>
Londe and Demen&yuml; found their photographic experiments intersecting
with the world of popular entertainments. And certainly part of
the fascination with Charcot's "Tuesday Lessons" came less from
their scientific demonstrations than from the complex scenography of
attractions--erotic, sadistic, and simply curious--that Charcot evokes
from his women patients. In fact, one of Charcot's critics, Leon Daudet,
even described the sessions as Grand Guignol.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 But more is at issue here than an unmasking of the motivations behind
 scientific display. Curiosity indicates an audience that remains
 skeptical, capable of devising his or her own explanation of the
 phenomenon before them.

<P>
It was precisely this skeptical but curious spectator that Barnum wished
to attract to his museum, employing what Neil Harris has called an
"operational aesthetic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
According to Harris the operational aesthetic draws viewers who want
not only to see a marvel, but to understand and speculate on how it
works. An impresario technique tailored to an age of technology and its
fascinations, this aesthetic both excites and satisfies curiosity and
supplies a very different aesthetic experience from that of traditional
art forms. It was precisely such curiosity that drew the first spectators
to the premieres of motion pictures devices. They came to see a new
technology demonstrated, and they received it with discussions of how it
was achieved. Thus the first exhibitions of the <I>Cin&eacute;matographe,
</I>the Vitascope, or the Biograph, while certainly part of modern show
business, were not as divorced from their scientific progenitors as
might at first appear. It is as though the two aspects of Augustine's
<I>curiositas, </I>the investigation of nature and the fascination in
novelties, had been rejoined in a peculiarly modern gnostic impulse.

<P>
It should come as no surprise, then, that motion pictures of faces, films
consisting entirely of facial close-ups, formed an important genre of
early film, dating, as I indicated earlier, from the very first attempts
at motion pictures undertaken by Edison


<B></B>


and Demen&yuml;. These first experiments became in cinema's first decade
a genre known as "facial expression" films, which display very clearly
this early motion picture aesthetic founded on curiosity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 In line with the operational aesthetic, such films demonstrated
 to early audiences cinema's ability to capture complex and detailed
 motions. Although Fred Ott's sneeze and May Irwin and John Rice's kiss
 were ordinary everyday actions, captured on film they became subjects
 of curiosity. The close framing of these brief films endowed them with
 a sense of physical proximity that was particularly startling given the
 actions portrayed, inviting scrutiny and delivering surprise. While the
 ideology of the close-up in later narrative cinema invited emotional
 intimacy, the physical closeness of these early images seem rather to
 be confrontation and comical.

<P>
Once these images had emerged from the confines of Edison's kinetoscope
(a peepshow device into which each viewer peered to see small moving
images through a magnifying lens) and were projected on the screen, the
new possibility of giganticism added to their unfamiliarity. The huge
enlargement of the close-up was advertised as an attraction of facial
expression films, as in this announcement from 1902 by the English film
company Hepworth for their film <I>Comic Grimacer. </I>"A human face shown
the full size of the screen is always a comic and interesting sight."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 If this sort of novelty satisfied the curiosity of popular culture, it
 could stick in the throats of traditional genteel culture whose modes
 of aesthetic representation seemed to be upset by such unsublimated
 attention to the human face. The editor of the Chicago literary
 journal <I>The Chap Book </I>in 1896 sputtered after seeing the <I>May
 Irwin-John Rice Kiss </I>projected on the screen. "When only life
 size it was pronounced beastly. But that was nothing to the present
 sight. Magnified to Gargantuan proportions and repeated three times
 over it is utterly disgusting."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 The Rabelaisian reference here may be more significant than the
 author intended. Early facial close-ups, whether in single shot facial
 expression films or serving as emblematic shots in early mulit-shot
 films, frequently show the mouth in action, eating, slobbering, kissing,
 guffawing and generally partaking of the carnivalesque pleasure of the
 open orifice in a most unseemly manner. As with Charcot, the camera
 once again aimed at bodies out of control, but with a very different
 viewing perspective in mind. Rather than supplying the intimate
 moments that furnish narrative emphasis or reveal psychology, as
 is typical of close-ups in later cinema, close-ups in early cinema
 display monsters and giants, their mouths swallowing and chewing,
 before viewers who are fascinated (and sometimes repulsed) by the
 new revelations of such unusual sights. In their very physicality and
 lack of aesthetic sublimation, such images are closer to the images
 of scientific facial photography than to the romantic close-ups of
 shimmering movie stars in later cinema. Thus the simple illusionism
 that motion pictures seemed to afford could also be experienced as a
 new mode of perception, as motion reconstituted and defamiliarized by
 the technology of enlargement. Clearly motion pictures breached new
 modes of representation.

<P>
But if such images seem to subject the human face to an enlargement that
relates more to scientific scrutiny than to enraptured absorption, we
must not lose sight of





the comic nature of these close-ups, quite at odds with the sober
discourse of scientific investigation. The popular curiosity that delights
in these odd and marvelous expressions and facial behavior does part
company with the use of photography as a means of investigation and
operates more like a parody of the gnostic impulse. In their delight in
the ridiculous and nonsensical, the uncivilized aspects of the body,
the contortions rather than the expressions of the face, early facial
expression films derive from a long clowning traditions of grimaces which
stretches from medieval jesters through circus traditions to nineteenth
century vaudeville. Seen within this tradition, we can understand the
way these early close-ups not only denied access to the psychology
of characters but celebrated the very meaninglessness of their swiftly
changing grimaces, overturning the gnostic attempt to endow the face with
meaning, whether through occult resemblances or photographic scrutiny
of its phases.

<P>
The grimaces that Duchenne exiled from his system become in these films
the major motivation for the facial play. Enlarged enormously, such
grimaces became even more grotesque than any performer in the circus or
the caf'conc could manage, a true carnival of flesh brought to visual
acuity through modern technology. In these films the face cavorts on an
open playing field, freed from any relation to narrative or drama or any
labor of conventional signification. The performer faces the camera and
viewer directly and goes through a succession of expression dazzling in
their range and rapidity.

<P>
Of course the evolution of popular traditions of grimace humor and of
scientific investigations in the era of modernity did not take place
in hermetically separated realms. Daudet could compare Charcot's
demonstration to the Grand Guignol, while at that Parisian theater
of horrors, Andr&eacute; de Lorde took the <I>Le&ccedil;ons de Mardi
</I>as the subject for his grim drama <I>Une le&ccedil;on &agrave; la
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, </I>in which a hysteric patient tosses acid
in the face of an intern who has been sadistically torturing her, after
her accusations have been dismissed as hysteric symptoms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 And as Rae Beth Gordon has shown, the performance styles that were used
 by such turn-of-the-century <I>caf'conc' grimaciers </I>as Paulus were
 compared by fans such as J. K. Huysman to the hysterics of Charcot,
 who may even have served as models for such performers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 In tracing the intersections between scientific investigation and the
 curiosity of popular culture in the emergence of cinema at the end of
 the nineteenth century, I want not only to relate these two traditions,
 but to uncover a dialogue between them, centered on the semantically
 loaded and unceasingly ambiguous representation of the human face. In
 this encounter, the popular tradition has something to say to the
 scientific, as well as vice versa.

<P>
Unlike his predecessor Duchenne (who rested secure in his belief in
a God-given language of facial expression from which grimaces were
excluded), Charcot did investigate facial contortions (and perhaps this
is why he strikes us as so modern), seeking behind their chaos for the
<I>facies </I>of hysteria. Within the ampitheater of his clinic and
in the studio of the Photographic Service, his female patients' facial
gymnastics were presented to the public. His women patients were doubly
victims, subject


<B></B>


 both to the symptoms of their disease and the control and manipulation
 of their doctors, who provided, as Didi-Huberman and others have shown,
 the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of both the Tuesday lessons and the photographs
 of the <I>Iconographie.</I>

<P>
But in the early facial expression films such grimaces explode
any framework of interpretation, seeking only the curiosity and the
laughter of onlookers. Films such as Edison's 1902 <I>Facial Expressions
</I>or his 1903 <I>Goo Goo Eyes </I>seem to fulfill Didi-Huberman's
fantasy about Charcot's "star" patient Augustine, in which her impulse
toward "making a scene" might subvert Charcot's effort to create a
<I>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. </I>In her performances, Didi-Huberman declares,
Augustine shows "the mastery not of an autocrat, but of an acrobat"
(<I>IH,</I> 247-8).
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Similarly, in Edison's films the female performers contort their faces
 endlessly in a dazzling display of desterity and absurdity, invoking
 amusement, curiosity, occasional revulsion, and ultimately a certain
 admiration for their novel skill as facial performers.

<P>
Clearly we must resist the impulse to see the images presented by such
early films simply as fulfillments of a utopian desire that defies
narrative order and scientific symptomology in pursuit of an ethos of
pure play and physical transformation, a mode of representation using
mimesis to subvert cultural logic. As products of popular culture, these
films are deeply complicit in the stereotypes of patrarichal, racist, and
economically explotative ideolgoies, and the marks of these systems are
cearly legible in their imagery. However, they also contain, like the
dream world of commodity culture evoked by Walter Benjamin, the seeds
of utopian urges.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Utopian possibilities are opened by early cinema's non-narrative
 conrations of time and its direct confrontation of the viewer with
 images that seem familiar and yet are also uncanny. If the history
 of the close-up ultimately extends to the nearly religious absorption
 in the mystery of the human countenance, the sort that Roland Barthes
 expresses in his rapture over the face of Garbo, we can see its origins
 in a very different gnostic impulse, a curiosity about the meaings of
 the face and an attempt to assert mastery over it through the analysis
 and classification of its muscle structure, its evolutionary derivation,
 and its forms of deviance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 The desire to know the face in its most transitory and bizarre
 manifestations was stimulated by the use of photography; but that desire,
 in turn, also stimulated the development of photography itself, spurring
 it to increasing technical mastery over time and motion, prodding it
 toward the actual invention of motion pictures. Paradoxically, once
 the illusion of motion was technically feasible, emphasis could shift
 from the dominating eye of the scientist to the skill of the performer
 as the facial close-up became an arena for grotesque grimaces and goo
 goo eyes, a delight facial play.

<P>
The face had formerly served as a guarantor of meaning and significance, a
mode of communication that exceeded any conventional or cultural system of
exchange; but modern science and medicine first dissolved this guarantor
into pure phsical materiality or a welter of chatoic symptoms. Yet as
the techniques of photography attempted to penetrate this apparent chaos
and discover new patterns of regularity, the popular art of early cinema
again allowed this investigation to dissolve into





curiosity and amusement, rehearsing an encounter with representation
that the techniques of aesthetic modernism would replay on a different
level, borrowing, as Surrealism in particular acknowledged, a great deal
from its popular predecessors.

Of course Duchenne was not the first to consider the mobile aspect of the
face, even if he was the first to use technological means--photography--to
capture it--hence his crucial importance to my argument. Le Brun's
distinction between the Passions and Physiognomy accented the difference
between structure and expression and Lavater's great critic Lichtenberg
based himself in this distinction as well (<I>PEN,</I> 77). I thank
Mikhail Yampolski for pointing this out to me, along with other
oversimplifications of an earlier draft. Although Duchenne speaks of
having taken some of the photographs himself, they were taken by Adrien
Tournachon, the brother of Felix Tournachon the famed photographer known

Historians of American music have vigorously acclaimed the rising
young composers of the 1920s. As the legend goes, that decade saw
something special happen, and New York City was the central place
where it occurred. Challenging a conservative and inhospitable music
establishment, res such as Aaron Copland, Henry Cowell, and Edgard
Var&egrave;se struck out on their own to form performance societies and
publishing enterprises that would promote the newest compositions. In
a few short years New York was transformed from a remote outpost of
modernism, a city whose concert life had been suffocated by "the grey
musty presence" of the traditional European repertory (as the critic
Paul Rosenfeld rued in 1920), into "the capital of the musical world,"
as contemporary commentators repeatedly boasted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The composers at the center of these changes deliberately cultivated
 an image of autonomy and iconoclasm. While such a stance was basic to
 modernists throughout the Western world, it assumed particular contours
 in the United States, where the battle for recognition and respect was
 especially intense. Leaders among America's young composers, perhaps
 by necessity, became deft spin artists who shaped gritty images of
 self-sufficiency, often tapping into cherished American myths of
 the pioneer and the inventor. Henry Cowell, for example, described
 his colleagues from this period as "experimental," "uninhibited," and
 "untamed," characterizations that have been repeated over the years by
 subsequent historians. The British critic Wilfrid Mellers, in a survey
 of American music history, titles his chapter on composers since World
 War I, "The Pioneer and the Wilderness."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>


<B></B>

<P>
While notions of iconclasm and aesthetic autonomy can account for some
features of the modern-music movement in New York during the 1920s,
they obscure the complexity of the community that brought it into
being. Composers certainly dominated the foreground, but they did not
attain success alone. Theirs was a collective effort rather than one of
isolated trailblazers, and it succeeded because of an intricate network
of publishers, promoters, performers, editors, and patrons. At its core
were women. They often worked behind the scenes, devising strategies to
give the new music viability on the American cultural scene. As Walter
Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony Society, wrote in 1923,
"I do not think there has ever been a country whose musical development
has been fostered so almost exclusively by women as America."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Damrosch was not just reflecting on the recent past, when women had
 worked to establish prominent musical institutions such as the New York
 Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera, but also revealing much about
 the scene in which the avant-garde was taking hold.

<P>
Simultaneously, however, Damrosch's comment also pinpointed the
limitations of women's involvement in modern music: they "fostered" its
growth. Among American modernist composers, few were female--only Marion
Bauer, whose work as composer, critic, and teacher remains insufficiently
appreciated, and Ruth Crawford Seeger, a much more widely acclaimed
re, especially for her innovative <I>String Quartet 1931</I>. Some
women specialized in performing new repertory, most notably the singers
Eva Gauthier, Greta Torpadie, and Radiana Pazmor. Others edited New
York's composer magazines. Minna Lederman was the best known among them
for her work at the helm of <I>Modern Music, </I>a "little magazine"
published in New York from 1924 to 1946; Louise Var&egrave;se, wife of
the composer and noted translator in her own right, worked with Carlos
Salzedo to edit <I>Eolian Review, </I>a harp journal that became a forum
for Edgard Var&egrave;se's International Composers' Guild; and Ely Jade,
a pseudonym for Germaine Schmitz, edited <I>Pro Musica Quarterly, </I>the
publication of yet another modern-music organization, Pro Musica, that
was directed by her husband E. Robert Schmitz.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 While a complete account of the impact of women on New York's new-music
 movement would treat all these res, the focus here will be on a
 sector of female activity that was crucial to shaping the institutional
 network in which modernist composers emerged--the patronage of Gertrude
 Vanderbilt Whitney, Alma Morgenthau Wertheim, and Blanche Walton, and
 the patronage and organizational skill of Claire Reis. These women
 have been largely absent from accounts of the period, partly because
 they chose to keep a low profile and documentation of their work is
 sparse, but partly because of lingering if unacknowledged attitudes
 about gender and the writing of music history. A broader account of the
 new-music movement that explores their contribution can offer striking
 perspectives on this critical decade, revealing close connections to
 patterns of patronage in literature and art; suggesting what might
 on the surface seem an unlikely alliance between social feminism and
 the American avant-garde; and raising questions about the interaction
 between patronage and commercialization in the growth of modernism.

In 1925 George Antheil, a brash young American who two years later was
to achieve notoriety for the premiere of his <I>Ballet M&eacute;canique
</I>in Carnegie Hall, wrote to Mary Louise Curtis Bok, the woman who was
generously financing his work. While his outcry was typically histrionic,
it articulated the central economic issue for his generation:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If you want composers like Beethoven or Chopin, you shall have to be
prepared to do what the princes of other days did for these people. The
joke of it is that the rich and wealthy people of our States want
these thing[s] <I>without paying for them </I>[underlined twice]. For
<I>nothing! </I>The princes of other days had to pay for them. So will
the princes of today.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Antheil made his appeal, of course, not to the American equivalent of
a prince, but a princess, as did so many of his contemporaries. More
than men, women stepped forward as patrons of the American musical
avant-garde. Whether Mary Louise Curtis Bok in Philadelphia, Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., or Alma Morgenthau
Wertheim in New York City, women of means put their energy and dollars
behind young, often experimental, composers. This was not just a musical
phenomenon or an American one: wealthy European women subsidized the
avant-garde in music, and women on both sides of the Atlantic supported
writers and visual artists. Private patronage experienced a major revival
during the 1920s. In Paris, for example, the Princesse de Polignac
(an American from the Singer sewing machine family) supported Igor
Stravinsky; he dedicated his Piano Sonata of 1924 to her, and many of
his new compositions received private auditions in her salon. She also
subsidized Ravel and Satie, among others.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Well-to-do women also supported writers and painters of the period,
 for example Lady Gregory, who financed Yeats; Harriet Shaw Weaver, who
 subsidized Joyce; or Mabel Dodge Luhan, who supported D. H. Lawrence
 and others. In discussing early twentieth-century modernist writers,
 both European and American, the literary critics Sandra Gilbert and
 Susan Gubar have observed:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A striking characteristic of the twentieth-century avant-garde, after
all, was its determinedly anti-commercial cast. Perhaps there has been
no circle of writers since the sixteenth century which was more dependent
on private patronage, and, like such sixteenth-century res as Sidney
and Spenser, many prominent modernists were subsidized by a series of
wealthy women or publicized by a set of powerful women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Patronage during the 1920s, writes historian Dorothy Brown, was a
"feminized" area, similar to teaching, social work, nursing, and
librarianship; while Minna Lederman, longtime editor of <I>Modern Music,
</I>later observed that the rich felt a deep responsibility to support
the arts during the 1920s, that being a patron then was "like tithing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>


<B></B>

<P>
Such was certainly the case with Whitney, Wertheim, and Walton, who
provided essential financial help and moral support to New York's
concert-music composers during the 1920s. Yet for Americans, private
patronage of composers was a relatively new concept. In the late
nineteenth century, as an American wealthy class rose to prominence
through expanding railroads, mines, and industry, it became involved
in supporting cultural improvement. In music, however, support most
often went toward performance, not composition, and its focus was on
the European repertory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
Just as the notion of being a patron followed European models, so too did
the choice of music to support. The same occurred with American museums:
underwriting the purchase and exhibition of European masterworks brought
a cachet of sophistication and cultivation that local art could not
match. America's wealthy citizens munificently funded the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, and
Carnegie Hall, but with the exception of Isabella Stewart Gardner, who
in Boston at the turn of the century subsidized Charles Martin Loeffler,
they paid little attention to native composers.

<P>
Things began changing in the late 1910s, especially with the work
of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, and by the early 1920s patronage
of composers was becoming more frequent. Though many continued
to support the performance of European masterworks, other patrons
reached out to contemporary American composers, and they made quite a
difference. Suddenly an ambitious group of young musicians did not need
to spend time earning a living outside of composition, as had William
Billings who worked as a tanner in late eighteenth-century Boston,
or Charles Ives who built a successful insurance business in early
twentieth-century New York. Instead they could devote themselves fully
to practicing their art.

<P>
Gertrude Whitney, Alma Wertheim, and Blanche Walton, then, were continuing
an old tradition but giving it a new twist. Each allied herself with
a different faction of the avant-garde, and each shaped her giving
in an individual way. In biographical terms, they sought personal
satisfaction by contributing to a cause that seemed both adventuresome
and important. In an institutional sense, they established a fragile
but crucial network for the early performance and reception of the
avant-garde in New York.

<P>
Although remembered primarily as a patron of visual artists, Gertrude
Vanderbilt Whitney (1875-1942) advanced modernism in America in a
variety of art forms, including music. An accomplished sculptor, she
was a major benefactor of the famous 1913 Armory Show, through which
European modernist painting first reached New York, and her Whitney
Studio Club, located on West Eighth Street in Greenwich Village, led
to the founding of the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1931. Her
involvement in music, while less celebrated, had a similar purpose:
to promote modernism in a society reluctant to accept it. The focus of
her support was the Franco-American composer Edgard Var&egrave;se and
others within the so-called "ultra-modern" camp ("ultra-modern" being
a designation during the 1910s and 1920s for a range of new styles that
seemed either especially experimental or notably distinct


<B></B>


from the music of Western Europe). Whitney's patronage of Var&egrave;se
began in 1917, when she helped underwrite his performance of Hector
Berlioz's <I>Requiem </I>at the Hippodrome, and continued two years later
with his New Symphony Orchestra, a group that in retrospect seems like
a musical response to the Armory Show. Whitney was among a group of four
women who formed the orchestra's "executive committee."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In April 1919 the New Symphony Orchestra gave a concert conducted by
 Var&egrave;se, which included American premieres of works by the European
 modernists Alfredo Casella and B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k. Afterwards,
 in the wake of a harsh critical response, the venture ended abruptly
 with Var&egrave;se's resignation.

<P>
More important was Whitney's position as "one of the principal sponsors"
of Var&egrave;se's International Composers' Guild, founded in 1921 as
an early organization devoted to promoting modernist music in New York
(<I>VLD,</I> 154). Whitney provided the group with direct financial
support and housed its office at the Whitney Studio Club from mid-1923
to late 1925.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 During its six-season existence, the Guild gave a series of important
 premieres, including those of Var&egrave;se's own music and compositions
 by Carl Ruggles, an American composer renowned for writing "dissonant
 counterpoint." Its main activity, however, was directed toward bringing
 the newest European compositions to New York. The Guild sponsored
 American premieres of Stravinsky's <I>Renard </I> and <I>Les
 Noces </I>, Satie's <I>Sports et divertissements </I>, and
 Milhaud's <I>Saudades do Brasil </I>, and its most illustrious
 moment came with the presentation of Arnold Schoenberg's <I>Pierrot
 lunaire </I>on 4 February 1923, eleven years after its world premiere in
 Europe. By then <I>Pierrot </I>was a middle-aged icon of modernism. Yet
 its belated American premiere was more than an example of American
 cultural lag, as historians have often claimed in connection with
 such events. The New York debut of <I>Pierrot </I>occurred at a
 time when the work was being revived elsewhere as well, following a
 break in performances during World War I. Beginning April 1921, the
 Society for Private Performances in Vienna--in many ways the model for
 Var&egrave;se's International Composers' Guild--presented <I>Pierrot
 </I>in both Vienna and Prague.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In January 1922 Darius Milhaud conducted it in Paris (he also attended
 the New York premiere), and shortly after its New York debut Alfredo
 Casella introduced it to Italy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 World War I inhibited the dissemination of other European modernist
 compositions as well.

<P>
In supporting the International Composers' Guild, Gertrude Whitney
was following the example of older members of her family, most of
whom were male, but she did so in her own way. Among the heirs of the
Vanderbilt family fortune, built on ships and railroads, she expanded
her financial base by marrying Harry Payne Whitney, whose money lay
largely in oil and tobacco. Yet the Whitneys and Vanderbilts had focused
their philanthropy on major institutions such as Columbia University and
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gertrude, instead, directed her gifts
to living artists. For her, patronage became a way of relieving what
historian Ann Firor Scott has termed "the inchoate sense of uselessness
which afflicted young women of leisure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 It also helped her cope with an unhappy marriage. After bearing children
 and submitting to the constraints of New York's high society, Whitney


<B></B>


seemed like a wealthy counterpart of Lily Bart in Edith Wharton's <I>House
of Mirth, </I>whom Wharton characterized as "so evidently the victim of
the civilization which had produced her that the links of her bracelet
seemed like manacles chaining her to her fate."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Whitney, in a similar fashion, confessed to her journal in 1901 a
 feeling of uselessness: "I pity, I pity above all that class of people
 who have no necessity to work. . . . [The wealthy are] the great and
 grand unemployed--the dregs of humanity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Patronage, like sculpture, provided Whitney with a means of attaining
 fulfillment.

<P>
Whitney's support of Var&egrave;se appears to have been her primary
activity in new music. Besides helping to underwrite his performance
organizations, in 1921 she gave him what his wife Louise later described
as "an adequate allowance" so that he would not have to take a job
(<I>VLD,</I> 155). It is unclear how long her subsidies lasted. She also
hosted post-concert parties and lectures. After the Guild's first concert
in February 1922, she threw a party at the Whitney Club that was attended
"by practically the entire audience," as Louise Var&egrave;se later
recalled, and in subsequent years there were social events for composers
at the Club and at the home of Juliana Force, Whitney's secretary
and active liaison to artists (<I>VLD,</I> 172). But details about her
substantial support of the International Composers' Guild remain obscure,
in part because Var&egrave;se's papers are inaccessible to scholars and
little about this facet of Whitney's work survives among her papers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 There is a broader reason as well. Looking back on her patronage of
 visual artists, the painter John Sloan observed: "No one will ever know
 the extent of the private benefactions Mrs. Whitney performed through
 Mrs. Force. The records have been destroyed, probably at Mrs. Whitney's
 request. But . . . I know of innumerable artists whose studio rent
 was paid, or pictures purchased just at the right time to keep the
 wolf from the door, or hospital expenses covered, or a trip to Europe
 made possible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<P>
Because information about Whitney's music patronage is so sparse, her
importance can easily be slighted. Yet her assistance in launching the
first major organization for American modernist composers made her one
of the earliest patrons to subsidize new music in New York. By extending
the kind of support already being given visual artists to those who wrote
music, Whitney's efforts in the late 1910s and early 1920s helped turn the
attention of American patrons away from performances of European classics,
which were a safe investment with high cultural prestige, and towards
American composers. A kind of venture capitalist for new music, she
supported a key modernist and his institutional forum, confident that her
investment would yield a more vital and imaginative creative environment.

<P>
Alma Morgenthau Wertheim (1887-1953) expanded on the work begun by
Whitney. A decade younger than Whitney and a child of Jewish financiers
rather than Protestant industrialists, Wertheim began her support for
new music within Whitney's orbit, becoming one of several subsidiary
financiers of the International Composers' Guild.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 But Wertheim soon went her own way, largely focusing her support on the
 League of Composers, a rival organization within New York's modern-music
 movement. There were other revealing differences between the two women.


<B></B>


While Whitney's deepest connection had been to the visual arts and her
direct participation in new music had been slight, Wertheim took much more
of a composer-focused, hands-on approach. She was among the dissenters
who broke from the Guild in 1923 to form the League of Composers, she
became an active member of the new organization's board, and she founded
her own publishing firm for issuing new scores.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Wertheim helped turn the League of Composers into a major force in
 American music. Although initially modeling itself on the Guild by
 featuring new European compositions, the League went on to nurture
 native talent, becoming an important sponsor of Aaron Copland and other
 Americans who had studied in France with Nadia Boulanger.

<P>
In yet another contrast to Whitney, Wertheim's work as a music patron
has been better documented, though its sources are still scattered. The
Morgenthau archive at the Library of Congress contains materials mostly
about male family members, especially Alma's father, the financier and
ambassador Henry Morgenthau, and her brother Henry Morgenthau, Jr., who
was secretary of the treasury under Franklin Roosevelt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Her first husband, Maurice Wertheim, owned a Wall Street investment
 firm and was a major patron of the Theater Guild. (Their marriage ended
 in 1929.) Thus information about Alma's legacy largely comes from the
 files of composers--especially Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, and Louis
 Gruenberg--and from interviews with Claire Reis and Minna Lederman,
 two women with whom she worked at the League. Even her daughters (who
 included the late historian Barbara Tuchman) saved few of her papers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P>
Wertheim's efforts took several forms. One involved contributions to
new-music organizations. In addition to providing cash to both the
Guild and the League, she underwrote the League's journal <I>Modern
Music </I>for its first few years, contributing $1500 annually to its
publication costs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 She also gave stipends to individual composers, most of whom fell within
 the League's orbit. Copland was a chief recipient of her help and became
 a kind of hub around which her patronage spun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Ironically, considering that the modern-music movement focused on
 breaking with the past, Copland's link to Wertheim began within the
 social conventions of old New York. In 1925 he made at least two
 pilgrimages to her Upper East Side apartment for tea; both times he
 played some of his music, and as a result she handed him a check for
 $1000. Copland later recalled, "I don't know how, without that, I would
 have managed in the year that followed while I was composing Music
 for the Theatre," recounting a key example of how support networks
 were formed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Copland wrote this jazz-inflected composition for chamber orchestra while
 subsidized by Wertheim; at the same time he had a commission for it from
 the League of Composers. Wertheim also helped others. She presented Roy
 Harris with at least $1800 so he could study with Nadia Boulanger, and
 she provided smaller cash stipends to Israel Citkowitz, among others.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<A NAME="1" HREF="4.1oja_1.html">
<IMG
ALT=""#660066" 1. "
ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/4.1oja_1b.gif"></A>
Another aspect of Wertheim's work was by far the boldest and ultimately
the most monumental: the founding of Cos Cob Press in 1929, which in
the next nine years published some thirty-five volumes of music by young
Americans. These were scores


<B></B>


that commercial houses of the period would never have released. Cos Cob
Press gained distinction as Copland's first major American publisher, and
it also gave publication premieres to Roy Harris, Walter Piston, Roger
Sessions, and Virgil Thomson (see <A HREF="4.1oja_1.html"> 1</A>),
most of whom had some link to Nadia Boulanger or the neoclassical style
then in vogue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Wertheim underwrote all the expenses of the press, and through it
 she joined other women, especially in Paris, who were publishing the
 work of young writers. For example, Nancy Cunard ran The Hours Press
 in the late 1920s and counted Samuel Beckett among her major literary
 discoveries, and Caresse Crosby started Black Sun Press with her husband
 Harry, managing it singlehandedly after his death.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Wertheim was also involved in the firm's operation. She designed the
 cover used for the scores and helped select pieces to issue.

<P>
Yet Wertheim's relationship to composers was volatile. Minna Lederman,
a member with Wertheim of the League's board, described her as "a very
special re in her own circle . . . with beautiful taste for decor,
personal and otherwise, and a very hot, passionate temperament."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Her passion also affected her patronage: just as her tenure with
 the Guild ended explosively, so it did with the League. In the
 November-December 1928 issue of <I>Modern Music, </I>Wertheim's
 name did not appear on the League's Executive Board. It never turned up
 there again. According to Claire Reis, Wertheim resigned because of a
 confrontation over the design of <I>Modern Music </I>and a belief that
 her opinions were not being taken seriously by the board.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The next year she struck out on her own and founded Cos Cob Press.

<P>
Blanche Wetherill Walton (1871-1963) presents an altogether
different case. While Whitney allied herself with Var&egrave;se and the
International Composers' Guild and Wertheim focused on Copland and the
League of Composers, Walton took on


<B></B>


another faction of the new-music community: she became a close friend
of Henry Cowell and some of his colleagues among the "ultra-moderns,"
including Ruth Crawford, Carl Ruggles, and Charles Seeger. All stylistic
experimentalists and mostly hailing from outside New York, although
spending large blocks of time there during the 1920s, these composers
produced some of the more radical compositions of the decade. Walton
was by no means as wealthy as Whitney or Wertheim, and the cash stipends
that she gave were modest. But her big contribution came through offering
housing and hospitality to composers and presiding over a kind of salon
for the ultra-moderns. In other words, she exploited the traditional
female domain of the home to help the struggling avant-garde, becoming
a kind of domestic impresario. Carl Ruggles, an irascible Vermonter
who often stayed in her apartment when in the city, acknowledged her
importance in a 1928 letter: "Keep on, and you will become such a power in
musical circles that all we poor, damned composers will have to do is to
take our scores and our troubles to you and everything will be 'velvet.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P>
Like Whitney and Wertheim, Walton took up her work as part of a search for
personal satisfaction. Unlike them, she had professional potential as a
musician. A gifted pianist who had studied with Edward MacDowell, she was
later described by Henry Cowell as "a pianist of professional calibre in
the days when a public career was unthinkable for a girl of good family."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P>
Instead, after raising two children, she sought a new life in contemporary
music, and her various New York apartments--in Bronxville, at West 68th
Street and Central Park West, and in Washington Square--became havens
for experimentalists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Walton later recalled:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The one contribution I could make to the gifted and struggling pioneer
composer was to turn my apartment on Central Park West into a meeting
place. It was then a shabby elderly house which had a large corner room
which proved to be excellent for a music room with Steinway piano. My
rooms were comfortably apart which left other rooms for visiting composers
of whom Cowell was a frequent one.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Walton's patronage may have been inspired by the work of Edward De Coppet,
for whom her husband had worked. De Coppet was a major music patron in
New York early in the century, noted for having founded and supported
the Flonzaley Quartet, an ensemble holding the status of the Juilliard
Quartet today. And Cowell was most likely responsible for directing her
attention toward composers in his orbit. She met him through the singer
Radiana Pazmor during a visit to California in the early 1920s.

<P>
Walton was involved in the American modernist movement from the very
beginning of the decade. A few remaining letters, housed within a small
collection of her papers at the New York Public Library, suggest the
dimensions of her efforts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 She gave money to the International Composers' Guild.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 More important, she helped support Cowell's New Music Society, founded
 in California in 1925 as a West-Coast counterpart to the Guild. Like
 Var&egrave;se, Cowell initially focused on music by European modernists,
 but he soon became an activist for his American contemporaries,


<B></B>


 most notably through <I>New Music, </I>"a quarterly of modern
 compositions" that he began in 1927 and distributed nationally. Walton
 also supported that enterprise. Principally, though, she gave composers
 free housing in New York. B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k used her West 68th
 Street apartment as a base during his 1927 tour of the United States;
 Carl Ruggles and Henry Cowell stayed with her for long periods; and
 during the winter of 1929-1930 Ruth Crawford lived with Walton
 while she began studying with Charles Seeger. Also, the first meeting
 of what would become the American Musicological Society was held at
 her apartment in 1930.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P>
Walton's private musicales also served an important function for young
modernists. In early December 1929, for example, she arranged an informal
concert in her apartment for Ruth Crawford, which featured the premiere
of Crawford's <I>Suite No. 2 for Four Strings and Piano.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Another musicale, probably scheduled that same year, centered on Aaron
 Copland's work, suggesting that Walton's generosity extended beyond
 the circle surrounding Henry Cowell.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P>
Because Walton did not take on huge financial responsibilities with
new music, like Whitney and Wertheim, or step forward as an outspoken
activist, as will be seen with Claire Reis, her legacy is more difficult
to assess. Measured against today's standards of feminine achievement,
her work could easily be devalued because of its domestic nature. Yet
by establishing a base of operation for struggling young composers
and by hosting musicales, as well as after-concert parties, she gave
essential assistance. The ultra-modern wing of the American composers'
movement was not as well organized in the 1920s as that of the so-called
"neoclassicists." Cowell began the Pan American Association of Compoers
in New York in 1928, which established a crucial forum, but it was
a small organization that had only limited activities its first few
years. By offering up her apartment, Walton gave these composers a
much-needed headquarters for their work--a kind of private club for
radical thinkers. In 1959, Henry Cowell paid tribute to Walton, calling
her "one of the most important and best beloved sponsors that modern music
has had here." He went on to pinpoint the substance of her contribution:
"Much of the activity of composers of modern music was centered in her
home, and we owe to her hospitality an early focusing of modern musical
thought in New York. She created a stimulating atmosphere where nothing
but generosity toward divergent ideas was possible."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P>
As patrons, then, these women provided the support necessary for composers
to write, publish, and perform new works. While their gifts took different
forms--whether giving stipends to individual composers, subsidizing
performance organizations, underwriting the publication of music and
journals, hosting social functions after concerts, presenting musicales,
or housing composers--they shared a commitment to advancing modernism
in America. Yet an important part of their role as patrons was to stay
modestly in the background. Louise Var&egrave;se called Gertrude Whitney
"self-effacing," and the same adjective could be applied in varying
degrees to all three (<I>VLD,</I> 153). A woman's place as patron was to
be selfless as well as generous. Her creative energy went into discovering
and encouraging others, not into drawing attention to her own work.


<B></B>

<P>

2. Volunteering for the Cause
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
While women patrons stood discreetly behind the scenes, Claire Raphael
Reis (1888-1978), perhaps the most indispensable woman to modernist
musicians in New York, was much more visible, first as executive
director of the International Composers' Guild and later of the League
of Composers. Her "luminous, nourishing energy," as the writer Waldo
Frank once characterized it, became legendary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P>
Diverse ideologies converged to inspire Reis. Ironically, given modern
music's small, elite audience, she approached her task with the tools
and ideals of a settlement-house volunteer. If Gertrude Whitney embodied
the high-society ambivalence of an Edith Wharton character, Claire Reis
reflected the social mission of Jane Addams or Lillian Wald. A consummate
organizer, she had deep roots in important feminized spheres--social
service and the woman's club--and she embraced the goals of social
feminism: to promote reform through vigorous action. While her female
contemporaries labored for the rights of children, new immigrants, and
the poor, Reis took on another of society's underdogs, the composer. Her
activism and progressive roots closely paralleled those of Katherine
Dreier, one of the founders and driving forces behind New York's
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme, an organization begun in 1920 to exhibit
contemporary art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Like the International Composers' Guild, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
 Anonyme came about through the alliance of a French modernist residing
 in New York--in this case Marcel Duchamp--and a high-energy woman.

<P>
Reis's career also reveals much about early musical modernism in New York,
especially the years between 1910 and 1920, a decade that remains largely
overlooked by music historians. Like Blanche Walton, Claire Reis was a
gifted pianist inhibited from becoming a professional by the conventions
of her time and class. While Reis later claimed that her teachers had
encouraged a concert career, "playing for charity was my mother's idea
of bringing up a musical daughter."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 And musical charity became her principal pursuit. But she also happened
 upon modernism while both she and it were young, especially through
 piano studies with Bertha Fiering Tapper at the New York Institute of
 Musical Art (now The Juilliard School).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Tapper held Saturday afternoon musicales at her home, and it was there
 that she presented Leo Ornstein, another of her students, whose career
 she helped promote. While New Yorkers were still concentraing on Brahms
 and Mahler, Ornstein began giving concerts of his own tone-cluster based
 compositions, earning instant notoriety as an "American Futurist." Reis
 later recalled bringing both the writer Waldo Frank and another of
 her good friends, the future critic Paul Rosenfeld, to hear Ornstein
 at one of Tapper's concerts (IVP). For all three, as for others, these
 musicales gave a valuable introduction to music that was just beginning
 to reach America, including recent compositions by Schoenberg, Satie,
 and Stravinsky. Frank vividly recalled an afternoon that probably took
 place in 1914:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The long room [in Tapper's home on Riverside Drive] with a fa&ccedil;ade
of windows giving on the Hudson was astir like a convention of
birds with the elegant gentlemen and ladies perched on their camp
stools. . . . [After Ornstein played some Debussy, Ravel,


<B></B>


 and Alb&eacute;niz], Mrs. Tapper stood up and announced to her guests
 that Leo would now play some of his own music. Leo responded with a
 voluminous, cacophonous broadside of chords that seemed about to blow the
 instrument in the air and break the windows. Chaos spoke [<I>sic</I>].
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Ornstein may have regaled them with his <I>Wild Men's Dance </I>of 1913
or <I>Three Moods </I>of the next year, both of which combined percussive
tone clusters with washes of impressionistic pentatonicism.

<P>
For Reis, encountering Ornstein "was really the beginning, the ear
opening, if not the eye opener for me" (IVP). In the spring of 1916,
eight months after Tapper's death, Reis took up her teacher's mission,
presenting Ornstein in a series of "Four Informal Recitals" at her home
on Madison Avenue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Those events were an important harbinger of the 1920s, as much for giving
 new directions to Reis's work in music as for laying crucial groundwork
 for the composer societies that would make modern music flourish in New
 York. Paul Rosenfeld had proposed the concerts in letters to Reis, and
 as he wrote, a glimpse of her future unfolded:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The point is, that in the back of my mind there is adesire to help
organize a modern music club . . . and I wonder whether an audience
gotten together for Leo's recital couldn't help form a nucleus for such
a society? There's really a crying need for such an organization to make
headway against the sluggish conservatism in musical circles.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
No such organization materialized immediately, but Rosenfeld's letter
shows that the idea for the International Composers' Guild and the League
of Composers was germinating in the mid-1910s, long before either came
into being.

<P>
Significantly, Reis was at the same time helping the poor. In 1911, she
had fulfilled her mother's vision of musical charity by establishing the
People's Music League, an organization that offered recent immigrants
some two hundred free concerts each year in New York schools.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 It was an extension of the settlement house, places such as the Henry
 Street Settlement House in New York or Hull House in Chicago where
 recent immigrants could obtain education and social services. Reis
 later called the concerts her "first satisfying experience combining
 music and social service in a civic project. . . . [It] stirred great
 sympathy [for] people poor and hungry for music."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 For the League's tenth anniversary in 1922 Reis staged a concert of
 contemporary music, which included works by Rebecca Clarke, Louis
 Gruenberg, Frederick Jacobi, A. Walter Kramer, Lazare Saminsky, and
 Deems Taylor, almost all of whom would become prominent in the League
 of Composers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 For Reis, it was a pivotal event:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

My reputation with the Cooper Union Composers' concert led me into
the next phase of music--this time with a feeling of service to
<I>composers</I>.<I> </I>. . . My sympathy for the masses and for music

<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
That fall, after the People's Music League ended, Reis became Executive
Director of the International Composers' Guild. It was a productive
but unhappy


<B></B>


appointment. She moved the concerts uptown to the Klaw Theater, which she
had obtained from a family friend at low rent; she put Alma Wertheim and
the art dealer Stephan Bourgeois, well known for his exhibits of modernist
painting, on the board; and she brought the Guild out of debt. Yet
Edgard Var&egrave;se felt that Reis had "[taken] over" the Guild, and he
disdained her after-concert receptions as "those delicatessen parties"
(<I>VLD,</I> 177, 186). His choice of words, coupled with the extent to
which anti-Semitism has surfaced in speculations about why the League
split from the Guild, may support the view that bigotry did play a rule
in severing the two groups. The anti-Semitism of one member of the Guild,
Carl Ruggles, was well-known at the time; and Virgil Thomson later called
the group the "League of Jewish Composers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 (He had felt ignored by its leaders in the 1920s--the League did
 not sponsor a performance of his work until February 1933--and he
 never forgot his sense of being excluded from the League's inner
 circle.) Claire Reis, however, vehemently denied that anti-Semitism had
 provoked the split, even though a substantial majority of the League's
 members were Jewish: "No, I definitely don't think there was any
 anti-Semitism at all. Salzedo was a Jew, Var&egrave;se's best friend."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P>
Reis's account of the schism focused on two points: the "great disorder"
at the Guild's board meetings and the degree to which some members
took pride in obscurity: "People like Ruggles would loudly voice their
opinions. His was, if more than a dozen people [were] in [the] hall they
were catering to the public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 While Ruggles and others believed that broad audience appeal threatened
 artistic corruption, Reis adopted a more populist perspective. In a
 1923 essay titled "Contemporary Music and 'the Man on the Street'"
 (published in the Guild's unofficial journal, <I>Eolian Review</I>),
 Reis urged that the ideal audience for new music might stem not from
 the "so-called musically educated class," as she put it, but from those
 less committed to the European classics. She went on:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
'The man on the street,' as signified by the average person without
esthetic standards which belong to the past, this man can hear, can
see, can sense an art belonging to his age because it is part of his
life, because he has not been educated to accept<I> definite laws based
upon tradition</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Modernist composers, in other words, might circumvent the audience that
attended performances by the Philharmonic or the Metropolitan Opera,
instead building a congregation of modernists from average lovers
of music whose aesthetic boundaries had not yet been firmly set in
place. Reis never spelled out who would make up this new constituency,
but it seems likely that she had in mind the same working class audience
who had participated in the People's Music League. Social feminism could
benefit modernist composers.

<P>
Not surprisingly, Reis's article was greeted with charges hurled at
other social feminists of the day. Jerome Hart, a conservative music
critic, dismissed her theory as evidence of the depths to which modernism
had plunged:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Of course, this is but a phase of present-day unrestand revolutionism,
which finds its extreme expression in Bolshevism, under which anarchists
are elevated into prime ministers,


<B></B>


 incendiaries and criminals into judges, and all the rules of decent and
 orderly living are thrown into the discard. It is a passing phase, in
 which ugliness, both moral and physical, boldly asserts itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Hart published this not long after the Red Scare of 1919-1920, when
the epithet "Bolshevist" had been hurled at many espousing new ideas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 It hit social feminists especially hard. The pioneering Sheppard-Towner
 Maternity and Infancy Protection Act of 1921, for which women had
 campaigned vigorously, was dubbed "Bolshevist" by its opponents, and
 four years later such name-calling defeated a child-labor initiative in
 Congress. Hart, in short, viewed both the music that Reis supported and
 the audience that she anticipated as subversive, a charge also leveled
 by the composer and critic Daniel Gregory Mason, a professor of music at
 Columbia University and a notorious reactionary against both modernism
 and jazz.

<P>
Reis's work in social service had prepared her for activism in new
music. As leader of the group that seceded from the International
Composers' Guild in 1923 to form the League of Composers, she became
Executive Director of the new organization, a successor in name as well
as spirit to the People's Music League.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 The League of Composers instantly offered a major forum in New York for
 the presentation of both European and American new music, and unlike the
 Guild, which collapsed in 1927, it remains active today. Reis conceived
 the organization in a democratic spirit, similar to other leagues founded
 at the same time, such as the Women's International League for Peace and
 Freedom or the National League of Women Voters. And she was tireless in
 mobilizing its resources. She organized its concerts, staged publicity
 campaigns, negotiated with conductors and performers, hosted social
 functions, raised money, provided office space in her home, and made
 her car and chauffeur available for conducting business. Directing
 the League became a full-time job, though her position was never
 salaried. Aaron Copland later characterized her as "a pro. Her day was
 as highly organized as that of any modern career woman," and his words
 provide an important clue to the context in which she should be viewed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 By no means a radical feminist, Reis fit into a particular breed of
 "modern" woman. Proud to have marched with the suffragists--or so her
 daughter, Hilda Bijur, recalls--she embraced a feminist ideal that
 combined activism with a Victorian sense of womanly duty.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 As one historian has observed, social feminists did not campaign
 for suffrage to advance themselves but "to win the power to clean up
 America. Social feminism was serviceable and safe."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Reis later acknowledged her model to be one of social feminism's great
 architects, Jane Addams, who advocated combining home and family with
 public service. Addams also supported volunteerism for women, and Reis
 later articulated the same philosophy: "In those days if a girl did
 not need to earn money, neither Jane Addams nor Lillian Wald--both very
 modern, liberal women--[did. They] were adamant that girls should not
 work for money" (IVP). To Reis and others of her generation, social
 service was modern, and volunteering provided an acceptable way of
 accomplishing it.


<B></B>

<P>
Also striking was Reis's connection to the Women's City Club of New York,
which was begun in 1916 by a group of suffragists, and, more importantly,
to the Auxiliary of the New York Philharmonic, both of which provided her
with well-tested strategies for running organizations and raising money.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 The Auxiliary had been formed during the 1921-1922 season, though
 its roots went back to 1909, and Reis had joined it the next season.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 She formed her own Auxiliary within the League of Composers in 1927
 and modeled it on the Philharmonic's, using it to finance special
 staged productions, such as those of Igor Stravinsky's <I>L'Histoire
 du Soldat </I>in 1928, his <I>Les Noces </I>in 1929, or Schoenberg's
 <I>Die gl&uuml;ckliche Hand </I>in 1930. The group had a membership
 of around thirty-five, mostly women, each of whom gave a small gift
 of approximately one or two hundred dollars for individual stage
 presentations. Some were recruited from the ranks of the Philharmonic's
 Auxiliary, notably the Countess Mercati, who chaired the League's
 Auxiliary and had served on the executive committee for Var&egrave;se's
 New Symphony Orchestra, and Mrs. Charles (Minnie) Guggenheimer, who
 had also helped with Var&egrave;se's orchestra and founded the famous
 Lewisohn Stadium Concerns in 1918 (an inexpensive popular summer series
 by the Philharmonic).
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Reis, in effect, was transporting the cultivated cachet of the New
 York Philharmonic to the new music supported by the League. Her donors
 supported appearances at the league by world-renowned conductors such
 as Pierre Monteux, Leopold Stokowski, and Tullio Serafin, performing
 well-established compositions by European titans. Yet this procedure also
 had limitations. When Reis asked the Auxiliary members to contribute
 to a composers' fund that would commission new works by Americans, she
 met with flat refusal: "We were keenly disappointed when not a single
 response came from any of the hundred-odd 'pillars of art,' although
 they had gladly spent $250 for a box from which to see and be seen for
 one evening. . . . They seemed little aware of the composer as a fellow
 human being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

<P>
Although the Auxiliary Board made it possible for the League to produce a
series of high-profile American stage premieres, its members often faced
criticism. Minna Lederman recalled that members were often referred to
as "the ladies." But she added: "I don't think they gave money except
when there was an opera coming on. . . . They did so then because of
the glamour of the conductor."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Others felt the same way about analogous groups. Louise Var&egrave;se,
 for example, recalled somewhat disparagingly that Var&egrave;se's New
 Symphony Orchestra had a "large Ladies' Committee" that did "whatever
 ladies' committees do" (<I>VLD,</I> 140).

<P>
Among Reis's many other achievements, a final item deserves attention:
her publication in 1930 of <I>American Composers of Today, </I>the first
catalogue of music by American modernists. While today the compilation of
bibliographies and work lists has become almost commonplace, in 1930, for
these composers, such a source was unique. It served as an invaluable and
highly practical means of giving conductors, performers, publishers, and
critics a sense of existing contemporary literature, and it made access
to these works possible. Two years later Reis produced a revision of
the catalogue with two-and-a-half times as many entries (expanding


<B></B>


from fifty-five names to one hundred and thirty-five), with subsequent
editions in 1938 and 1947.

</H3>

<P>
The involvement of Reis, Whitney, Wertheim, and Walton in new
music during the 1920s has been obscured in subsequent accounts of
modernism, but attitudes already in place at the time helped prepare
the way. Female leaders of composer organizations may have disparaged
the social pretensions of "the ladies" on their auxiliary boards, but
men who viewed these same groups often evinced even broader disdain that
also included women organizers and patrons. Some composers, it is true,
expressed gratitude for the help they had received; Copland and Cowell
publicly acknowledged their debts to Reis and Walton.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 But others all but demonized their benefactors, expressing gendered
 bigotry. Music critics tended to be the most outspoken, often attacking
 women as a group rather than singling out individuals, exposing a
 deep-seated misogyny with many sources.

<P>
On the one hand, the 1920s not only witnessed the birth of a new American
art, straining to free itself from ties to the past and to Europe, but
the continuing struggle of the "New Woman," whose desire for freedom was
equally as intense and ambitious. She threatened cherished traditions,
especially in the first decade after the nineteenth amendment, when
women gained the right to vote. As Minna Lederman put it, "We thought
we could do anything."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>

<P>
That was the "modern" side of the issue. For musicians, however, there
was an even stronger attitude that had roots in the nineteenth-century
notion of music as a feminized sphere. As stewards of the parlor, as
supporters of opera and symphony orchestras, as teachers, and as local
activists through music clubs, women had increasingly gained control
over certain aspects of music-making in the United States. For many men,
this gave music a disturbing air of effeminacy, leading musicians to a
"manliness complex," as a 1924 editorial in <I>Musical America </I>put it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
Women had become associated with the genteel tradition of the late
nineteenth century, and when that tradition faced rejection women
suffered accordingly. This was a major issue in early modernism, and
it remained strong throughout the 1920s. Further, women were viewed as
agents of "conspicuous consumption," to use Thorstein Veblin's famous
term, and so became an easy target in the complex of anti-commercialism
and anti-traditionalism fundamental to American modernism. Increasingly,
consonant music, and especially the pretty sort representing longstanding
European traditions, became linked with effeminacy, while strong
dissonance was labeled "manly" or "virile." Witness a review of one of the
Copland-Sessions Concerts, a series that from 1928 to 1931 was dedicated
to promoting the music of young American composers, in which a compliment
is paid in sharply gendered language: "But there is a pretty high average
in ideas and workmanship, and an an especially high one in virility."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>


<B></B>

<P>
Gender dichotomies frequently overlapped with distinctions between new
and old, highbrow and lowbrow. In an essay published in 1929, Nicolas
Slonimsky, a member of the young generation of composers, illustrated
this process at work. "Yes, we want our musical tastes to be governed
by the young sophisticates rather than by Mrs. Carrie Jacobs Bond"
(a turn-of-the-century composer of popular songs, most notably "I Love
You Truly").
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 Similarly, the composer George Antheil attacked popular tunes of the
 recent past with an obscene and gendered slur.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I pride myself with the fact that most of the themes [of Antheil's
<I>Second Sonata for Violin, Piano, and Bass-Drums</I>] are not
original. 'In the shade of the Old Apple Tree,' 'Hochee Chooche'
[<I>sic</I>], 'Darling, you are growing older,' and all the most
vomiting, repulsive material. This sonata is like Joyce, and like spew
. . . nevertheless it is electrical. For the first time in the history
of the concert stage the world is allowed to gaze raptuously [<I>sic</I>]
into an open cunt.

<P>
Women patrons, as highly visible focal points for the tensions
within modernism, were often criticized. In 1920 the critic Paul
Rosenfeld--the same Rosenfeld who was a close friend of Claire Reis and
would become one of the most enlightened voices of the decade (at least
in his concert-music tastes)--wrote an article for <I>The Dial </I>that
discussed the demise of Var&egrave;se's tenure with the New Symphony
Orchestra (the group subsidized primarily by Gertrude Whitney). The
orchestra's failure to succeed in performing contemporary music was
"one of the innumerable consequences of the fact that in America musical
organizations have patronesses more often than they have patrons."

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Great musical bodies cannot exist in America today, it is a commonplace,
without subsidies. . . . But in our civilization, the man is not
interested in art. . . . The control of the purer forms of music are
almost entirely left to the distaff side. . . . But, unfortunately, the
control by women of art is not the health of art. . . . In consequence,
artistic activity remains, for the majority of those who engage in it,
a lightly social expression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In the same vein are the remarks of Deems Taylor, a stylistically
conservative composer and well-known critic of the 1920s, who presented
his survey of contemporary music in <I>Civilization in the United
States, </I>a collection of essays that assessed the state of American
culture. "Women," wrote Taylor, "constitute ninety per cent of those who
support music in this country. . . . It is no disparagement of their
activities to say that such a state of affairs is unhealthy." Rather
than being lightweight, as Rosenfeld had charged, women were prone to
"demand that art be edifying" and to encourage chauvinism among American
composers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>

<P>
In 1928, a year after Var&egrave;se's next organizational effort, the
International Composers' Guild, had come to an end, Rosenfeld hailed
the group for its achievements and compared it with its principal rival,
the League of Composers--again in gendered terms. The League, which was
dominated by women, fulfilled "a social function where the performance
of music served the ambitions of mediocrities;


<B></B>


handsomely dressed people conversed up and down the aisles; and music
preluded to an apotheosis of personal projections and chicken salad in
close quarter."

As critics increasingly connected women to the new-musci movement,
they questioned whether those on the "distaff side" were capable
of intellectual engagement with the bold new sounds they were
fostering. Satire became a frequent weapon. In 1926, the critic
W. J. Henderson published an article in <I>The New Yorker, </I>titled
"The Modern Music Jag," in which he sarcastically pointed out that women
were giving up the Charleston for another fad: new music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 Three years later <I>Vanity Fair </I>published a
 caricature by the famed artist Miguel Covarrubias (see <A
 HREF="4.1oja_2.html"> 2</A>). Captioned "A Salon Recital of
 Modern Music: One of Those Awesomely Elegant Evenings Which Society
 Has to Suffer," it ridiculed wealthy women who presented musicales of
 new compositions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>


<B></B>


 Even in the socially conscious 1930s, when Marc Blitzstein composed
 his leftist work for musical theater, <I>The Cradle Will Rock, </I>he
 depicted a painter and composer who mock their patron as "a stupid woman
 . . . what she doesn't know about music would put Heifetz back on his
 feet again"--and who then eagerly accept an invitation to visit her
 country home for the weekend (scene 6). Blitzstein was saying as much
 about the hypocrisy of artists who accepted support as he was about the
 women who gave it, but he was also drawing on a cultural stereotype now
 firmly established. As late as 1981 the composer Jerome Moross dimsissed
 the League of Composers as not being "a dues paying organization, but
 . . . a pet project of two rich ladies who were constantly struggling
 over the leadership."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>

<P>
Such charges, now and then, have overlooked the importance of the social
functions hosted by women, occasions that made it possible for composers
to integrate themselves into a network of publishers, performers, and
concert managers. Var&egrave;se himself benefited from such events,
whether hosted by Gertrude Whitney or Juliana Force, as did composers
associated with the League. A particularly revealing document in this
regard is an annotated guest list drawn up by Aaron Copland in the spring
of 1930 for a party given by Blanche Walton, probably after one of the
Copland-Sessions Concerts on 13 April.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 Some of the guests were plainly invited for their topicality. The
 program that evening had included three new Hungarian works, Istvan
 Szelenyi's <I>Recitative, </I>P&aacute;l Kadosa's <I>Sonatina, </I>and
 Imre Weisshaus's <I>Piano Study, </I>and a number of Hungarians were
 among the invitees (the Hungarian Consulate General, the violinist
 Leopold Auer, the composer and violinist Sandor Harmati), most likely a
 reflection of Walton's association with B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k. There
 is also a small Polish contingent, in deference to a work by a Polish
 composer that had been performed. But the other invitees show that
 Copland was staging an event that brought together the many powerful
 res associated with modern music. They included leaders of the League
 of Composers, such as Claire Reis and her husband Arthur, as well as
 cofounders Emerson Whithorne and Federick Jacobi; concert managers,
 especially Arthur Judson and F. C. Coppicus, two of the most important
 of the day; and members of the press, especially the British critic
 and composer Leigh Henry and Robert Simon of the <I>New Yorker.</I>

<P>
It was through these mundane yet effective means that women patrons
and supporters played such a crucial role in the rapid acceptance and
institutionalization of modernist music. Yet their role in the new-music
movement in America during the 1920s also raises questions with ongoing
implications. Did women support a musical and cultural form that was
deeply implicated with misogyny? And if so, how did they view themselves
within it? Was the American modernist movement much more elitist and much
less based in counter-cultural impulses than we have often imagined it
to be? Was modernism's "traffic with the emerging world of consumerism
and fashion," as the literary critic Lawrence Rainey has urged, "more
complicated, more ambiguous" that we have often assumed?
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>

<P>
Modernist composers, in many respects, tried to have it both ways. They
constructed an autonomous profile and often took pride in the elitist
constituency to


<B></B>


which their music appealed. Deeply suspicious of the pressures brought
to bear by a mass market, they consciously distinguished themselves from
"commercial" musicians--a designation that was increasingly applied not
only to composers of popular songs, such as George Gershwin or Jerome
Kern, but to conductors of the standard European repertory, such as
Damrosch and Arturo Toscanini, who vigorously marketed the music of
Beethoven and Brahms through the newer media of radio and recordings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 At the same time, though, they sought recognition and success, and they
 were not above using techniques derived from the realm of commercial
 advertising to promote their work. Cowell staged a press conference--or
 as <I>Musical America </I>put it, "an impromptu recital for the benefit
 of the cameramen"--on the roof of the Knabe Building on Fifth Avenue a
 week after his Carnegie Hall debut in February 1924, and George Antheil
 hired a professional agent to promote the New York premiere of his
 <I>Ballet M&eacute;canique </I>three years later.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 Further, composers increasingly sought concert venues that would attract
 widespread publicity. In December 1924 the International Composers'
 Guild moved its concerts to Aeolian Hall, the same spacious facility
 where Gershwin's <I>Rhapsody in Blue </I>had premiered that February,
 and increasingly the Guild's programs featured conductor-celebrities,
 most notably Leopold Stokowski and Fritz Reiner. Even its premiere of
 <I>Pierrot lunaire </I>in 1923 had created a kind of popular sensation:
 the Klaw Theater had been packed, and the audience had included no less
 than the movie star John Barrymore, whom Minna Lederman later recalled
 meeting there.
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 And as already noted, productions of the League of Composers became
 increasingly splashy throughout the course of the decade.

<P>
But what of the women who funded and organized many of these events? Did
they willfilly submit to becoming scapegoats for composers' ambivalence
about success and commercialism? Little evidence survives to indicate
their reaction. Yet Minna Lederman, whom I knew during the final fifteen
years of her life, may provide a revealing example. Although a tough
professional, shrewd political strategist, and brilliant editor, she
never questioned the degree to which she helped build a world that was
largely male. She saw criticisms of wealthy female patrons, the League's
Auxiliary, or even Claire Reis, as being directed at another species. To
some degree, she saw herself as one of the guys, and her sense of being
exceptional may have been more common than we now imagine; some, perhaps
most, of the women attacked by composers and critics may have believed
that the bigotry they witnessed was directed elsewhere. Seeing themselves
as strong intellectuals and gifted administrators, not as representatives
of unpleasant stereotypes, they may have floated above the misogynist
comments that surrounded them.

<P>
However they rationalized their ambiguous status, women patrons were
collaborating with male composers who seemed to be as living in a state
of cultural paranoia. They feared their European contemporaries, who
they felt were viewed as the real thing, while they struggled for crumbs
of credibility. They feared jazz because it posed stiff competition,
especially among continental critics. "American music is not jazz. Jazz
is not music," declared Rosenfeld in the opening salvo of his <I>An Hour
with American Music, </I>essentially a treatise on behalf of American
modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 If they


<B></B>


were descendants of America's Protestant past, they feared Jews, who
were gaining prominence in many arenas of American musical life. And they
feared the women whose patronage and social networks were indispensable
to their careers. "Political, psychological, and aesthetic discourse
around the turn of the century," writes Andreas Huyssen, "consistently
and obsessively genders mass culture as feminine, while high culture,
whether traditional or modern, clearly remains the privileged realm of
male activities."

<P>
Male apprehension about "the 'wrong' kind of success," meaning
commodification, went hand in hand with "the persistent gendering as
feminine of that which is devalued."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>
 Women patrons and activists, in short, may have symbolized much more
 than the sum of their monetary contributions or hours volunteered. They
 represented gender change and shifting power relations. They highlighted
 the deep dependency of composers on a complex modernist community. They
 also reminded them of the degree to which new technologies were
 abetting the commodification of art. And they were easy targets, in
 part because they seldom struck back, preferring to position themselves
 above misogyny. Of the many paradoxes that characterized New York's
 modern-music community in the 1920s, one of the most vexing is how
 an aesthetic ideal so deeply committed to openness and free-wheeling
 experimentation should have been beset by so many self-constructed
 limitations. If we continue to accept the received account of this
 period, then the stories of Whitney, Walton, Wertheim, Reis, and other
 women who labored for modernism will stay safely within the realm of
 "women's history." If not, we may move closer to a more integrated
 assessment of the American musical past--one that honors all voices
 while keeping in plain view the tensions and paradoxes of the contexts
 in which they were first heard.

the Cincinnati Orchestra (it was she who hired Leopold Stokowski as the
Cincinnati Orchestra's conductor in 1909). An article published in the
Cincinnati <I>Times Star</I> after her estate was settled, gives a rare
view into the dimensions of one person's patronage. Among the reported $20
million that Holmes gave away during her lifetime, $222,812 went to the
Philharmonic Symphony Society of New York, $158,118 to the National Music
League, and $36,500 to the American National Opera Company. By contrast,
her gifts to the Guild must have been too small to be reported ("Holmes
Estate Is $7,836,623," [Cincinnati] <I>Times Star,</I> 23 December 1947;
clippings, Cincinnati Historical Society). Other information about Holmes
comes from: Oliver Daniel, <I>Stokowski: A Counterpoint of View</I>

The split between the Guild and the League ostensibly came over whether or
not the performance of <I>Pierrot lunaire</I> should be repeated after its
American premiere (Var&egrave;se opposed repeat performances, while those
who eventually formed the League favored them). But there was also a power
struggle going on between Var&egrave;se and Claire Reis, and it left hard
feelings on both sides. Probably because of this, Louise Var&egrave;se
gives little credit to Wertheim in writing the Guild's history. She
mentions Wertheim only twice: as one of Claire Reis's appointments to
the Guild's executive board and as a host of Guild meetings (<I>VLD,</I>
177, 185). In addition to her financial and administrative involvement
in the Guild, Wertheim wrote at least one article promoting its work,
"World-Wide Guild of Composers," <I>Christian</I> <I>Science Monitor,</I>
17 December 1922.

A "family history" of the Morgenthaus continues the focus on males,
noting that Henry Morgenthau, Jr., had "real talent" as a singer, but
that "a musical career was the last thing in the world [his father]
had in mind for his only son. Music was all right, though, for the
girls. Alma, one of my father's three sisters, trained her voice to the
edge of professionalism; later she became a discriminating and demanding
patron of avant garde composers like Arnold Schoenberg and Aaron Copland"

While New York composers tended to fall into separate ideological
camps after the split between the Guild and League, there was some
overlap. For example, a letter from Carl Ruggles to Blanche Walton,
written in 1926, shows that Wertheim continued to reach out to Ruggles,
one of the ICG's principal res: "Curious: Dr. Bartlett forwarded
a note from Mrs. Wertheim asking about me, and what I was doing, and I
answered her a fortnight ago, but have received no reply" (Ruggles to

Born in Brownsville, Texas, to a Jewish family, Reis moved to New
York with her mother, sister, and brother shortly after her father's
death in 1898. She first studied piano in France and Germany. "Notes on
Contributors" in <I>Eolian Review</I> 2 (March 1923): 28, accompanying
an article by Reis, states that she worked with Tapper from 1908 to
1910. However among Reis's papers is a photograph of Tapper, stating
on the back that Reis studied with her from 1906 to 1913; NYMD, Reis

Collection, Box 1a. Tapper (1859-1915) was an interesting re
in her own right. Born in Norway, she had studied in Leipzig with Carl
Reinecke and Louis Maas, and was friends with Edvard Grieg, for whom
she edited two volumes of piano compositions. Like many women, Tapper
focused her career on nurturing others. A. Walter Kramer, editor of
<I>Musical America</I> and another member of the circle that included
Tapper and Reis, noted this trait: "And so she lived, for others, never
for herself . . . I know that she composed much and that she destroyed
it, never wishing to have her music appear in print" (A. Walter Kramer,
"Bertha Fiering Tapper: Altruist [obituary]," <I>Musical America</I> 22

Ornstein as "just back from overseas successes," 1914 is a likely year
for this event left undated by Frank; Ornstein had just returned to
New York then after a highly acclaimed recital in London. There were
other connections between Frank and Reis. His first wife was Margaret
Naumburg, with whom Reis started the Walden School; and Reis's husband
Arthur, whom she married in 1915, was business adviser to Frank's little
magazine, <I>The Seven Arts,</I> which ran from 1916 to 1917. Arthur
Reis was president of Robert Reis and Company, a firm established by

her founding of the People's Music League came about under the aegis of

<I>The Freeman,</I> a journal for which Daniel Gregory Mason also wrote
(in fact he also discusses a contemporaneous article by Mason in this same
piece), and his language in <I>The Sackbut</I> sounds similar to that of
the critic Henry T. Finck, suggesting a pattern of linking revolution,
feminism, and modernist music: "Sch&ouml;nberg learned a lesson
from the militant suffragettes. He was ignored till he began to smash
parlor furniture [and] throw bombs" ("Schoenberg and the Suffragettes,"
<I>Musical Progress</I> [New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1923], 393). The
text of this excerpt is in turn very close to that of an unsigned review
in the New York <I>Post</I> on 27 January 1914; Finck was then music
critic for that paper. Connections between misogyny and modernist music
are explored in Catherine Parsons Smith, "'A Distinguishing Virility':
Feminism and Modernism in American Art Music," in <I>Cecilia Reclaimed:

"For some time past," wrote John Gould Fletcher in 1918, "various people
have been clamoring for a new religion, without seeing that a new one
was being born under their noses." The new religion has been created
in the newspapers, and its god, says Fletcher, is the tank. The tank
"has seized upon our imaginations":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Writers continually hymn for us His virtues. Short stories, sonnets are
dedicated to Him. His picture appears everywhere in our papers. Artists
paint Him as he appears upon the battlefield, and inventive children
experiment with model Tanks in wood and cardboard.

<P>
This god was invented in Britain during the First World War and first
used at the Somme in September 1916. The military and technical history of
the tank has been well documented; much less is known about its cultural
significance, especially among civilians.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 How did this new weapon alter the ways in which Britain imagined itself,
 its citizens, and its relationship to the war? The tank was one of
 the few innovations in which Britain was more successful than Germany;
 this alone gave it considerable ideological force. But its significance
 was far greater than its military value. For Fletcher, its "commanding
 personality" had "captivated" the civilian imagination. If the tank won
 the war, as its champions claimed, it did so through the mobilization of
 fantasy rather than on the battlefield. This paper attempts to show how.

<P>
The tank was developed to answer a serious military problem: to break
the deadlock on the western front. Not long after



<B></B>



the war began, the western front had become paralysed. Two powerful
armies faced one another in trenches which extended from the Belgian
coast to the Swiss Alps, a distance of nearly five hundred miles. Each
side was equipped with machine guns and artillery and was separated
from the other by impenetrable barbed wire. Neither side could advance;
unprotected troops trying to struggle through the barbed wire were mowed
down by machine guns and artillery fire. The war settled into the terrible
stalemate of 1915, followed by the failed pushes of 1916. The killing
continued, but the war itself was immobilized. To break the deadlock, some
kind of armored vehicle was needed to break through or crush the barbed
wire, knock out the enemy's gun emplacements, and allow the infantry
to advance--to transform stasis into movement. This need was answered
by the tank. Its champions envisaged hundreds of technically efficient
tanks launched in a sector of hard ground. The tank was Britain's secret
weapon, and would, it was hoped, overwhelm the Germans with surprise
and terror as well as technical mastery.

By the late summer of 1916, the high command was desperate for a success
at the Somme, following the hundreds of thousands of deaths since July
of that year. After intense political struggles within British military
circles, tanks were brought into action in September 1916--about six
months before they were ready--at one of the wettest, muddiest sectors
of the front (see <A HREF="4.1tate_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 By



<B></B>



this date, only sixty machines had been manufactured. Transporting them to
the front was a huge undertaking, and many of the crews were physically
exhausted before they reached the battle. Several tanks were damaged in
transit; others broke down on their way to the starting line. Several
more became bogged or broke down, and only eighteen actually took part
in the assault.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The tank crews were bitterly disappointed; the other troops were
 skeptical (<I>TW,</I> 37). But hardly anyone actually saw this failure,
 and it was reported in the newspapers as a remarkable success.

<P>
The newspapers were one of the most important sources of propaganda in
the Great War, as many historians have documented.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 They were also a key site in which civilians' fantasmatic relationship to
 the war was mobilized--and to some extent <I>produced.</I> When the first
 tanks went into battle, the <I>Daily Mail</I> announced a success for
 "our glorious infantry, airmen, and gunners, and . . . the wonderful
 new armored 'tanks,'" and gave a prominent place to a long report by
 its correspondent, Beach Thomas:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The sun rose to-day on a British success and a German defeat. It set on
an enhanced victory and a greater rout. . . . We are advancing still,
and the enemy still retreating. . . . Soon after six the spasmodic
barking of the cannonade (now normal in spite of its intensity) gave
place to a "kettle-drum bombardment." The "fun" was "fast and furious,"
and two minutes after the orchestra opened our men leaped from their
trenches. They were not unaccompanied. . . . we had brought up a certain
number of armored cars which the moonlight transformed into fantastic
monsters. . . . They looked like blind creatures emerging from the
primeval slime. To watch one crawling round a battered wood in the
half-light was to think of "the Jabberwock with eyes of flame" who
<!--_/extract-->

. . . these iron monsters . . . amused our men rather than encouraged
them. They were a jest, cheering hearts, possibly faithful creatures, but
no rival to the bayonet. . . . Munchausen never approached the stories
imagined for them by soldiers. But their pet name is "tanks," and they
were chiefly regarded as a practical joke. Whales, Boojums, Dreadnoughts,
slugs, snarks. . . . They were said to live in trees and houses and jump
like grasshoppers or kangaroos.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The propagandistic quality of the writing seems obvious: the use of
"we" and "our," the excess of praise ("our glorious infantry," etc.),
the duplicitous suggestion that the slow-moving tanks were "said"
(presumably by soldiers) to "jump like grasshoppers or kangaroos,"
when they were much more likely to be stuck in the mud. More striking,
however, are the metaphors which place the tank simultaneously in a
tradition of literary fantasy (Jabberwock, Munchausen) and somewhere in
prehistory. These images appear in a great many newspaper accounts, as
well as in tank histories, memoirs, literary works, and even official
military communications. <I>The Times,</I> for example, describing the
same battle, imagines the tanks as "unearthly monsters, cased in steel,
spitting fire," and likens them to toad-salamanders, echidna-dragons,
mammoths, Leviathan, and various other mythical and ancient beasts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 For <I>Punch,</I>



<B></B>



the tank is a dragon, mounted by St George.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Mitchell's tank history remembers the first tanks as "uncanny brutes
 emerged from some dim prehistoric age" (<I>TW,</I> 78).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Ford Madox Ford calls them "ugly, senseless armadillos" which move like
 "slow rats . . . snouting crumbs of garbage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P>
Almost all the early tank writings compare the machine to some kind of
dinosaur emerging out of the primeval mud. As Gertrude Stein remarks,
"war makes things go backward as well as forward."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 The most advanced weapon of 1916 takes civilization into a new
 phase of modern technology at the same time as plunging it back into
 prehistory--an image both terrifying and pleasurable. It is sometimes
 argued that the Great War destroyed belief in evolution, but the war's
 cultural resonances are actually more complex than this.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 With the tank, especially, evolution begins to run backwards and
 forwards, simultaneously--a vertiginous notion which informs a number
 of late modernist writings, from Ford's <I>Parade's End</I> (1924-1928)
 to Woolf's <I>Between the Acts</I> in 1941.

<P>
The first tanks also generate a peculiar kind of laughter, as <I>The
Times</I> correspondent suggests:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I watched the great things manoeuvre about the field, grotesque and
unspeakable; and at each new antic which they performed, each new capacity
which they developed, one could do nothing but sit down and laugh till
one's sides ached. Were they only a preposterous joke or were they a
serious contribution to modern warfare?
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Similarly, the <I>Southern Daily Echo</I> reports, "It makes you roar with
laughter to see one of them slide up to a house, go slick-bang through
the walls, and come out the other side without a scratch, leaving the
house, of course, just a pile of bricks and mortar."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Many of the reports present the tank as comical; a "preposterous
 joke", which is said to terrify the Germans and make the British laugh
 uncontrollably. What is the significance of this laughter? In Bergson's
 famous definition, laughter is produced by <I>"Something mechanical
 encrusted on the living."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 This seems appropriate for the tank, a machine which looks like a
 "self-propelling mammoth," "half battleship, half caterpillar."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 But Bergson also points out that laughter is "above all, a corrective";
 it "intends to humiliate." Laughter, in other words, has a political
 function; it helps a society to define itself and its borders, and to
 regulate behavior.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 This was particularly important in the last two years of the war, which
 produced new demands on the population and required that they consent,
 and keep on consenting, to the slaughter.

<P>
Very few people saw the tanks in battle; yet almost everyone in Britain
knew what they looked like. As Mrs. Humphry Ward remarked in 1917,
"London is full of tanks, of course--on the films."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Tank films were extremely popular, reaching an audience of perhaps
 twenty million people, and tanks made cameo appearances in various
 other war films.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 An exhibition in London in March 1918 claimed to include the world's
 largest photograph--twenty-three feet and six inches by seventeen
 feet--of



<B></B>



tanks on the western front.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Many other representations appeared, such as an "exclusive" tank toy
 for Christmas from Selfridge's.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 There were tank pleasure rides, tank handbags, tank teapots, tank
 money-boxes, paper napkins decorated with pictures of the Royal Family
 and tanks. Small china models of the tank were produced: these were
 about six inches long, and often decorated with a small picture--of
 Peterborough Cathedral, for example.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Often witty or parodic, these strange, uncanny objects projected the
 tank right into the heart of civilian culture.

<P>
As well as being surrounded by representations of the tank, a surprising
number of civilians saw tanks first hand, at close quarters, in Britain,
in one of the more surreal propaganda campaigns of the war. This campaign
can be traced through the newspaper reports in the spring of 1918.

<P>

On Friday, 1 March 1918, the British newspapers reported a new drive to
raise money for the war. The campaign was announced in mock-military
terms: "Business men all over the country are closing their ranks for
next week's great offensive to raise One Hundred Millions in National
War Bonds and War Savings Certificates."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 The "great offensive" was Business Men's Week, which aimed to persuade
 businesses to invest their entire week's takings in national war bonds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The preliminary responses were promising, as companies jostled to
 pledge their week's income, and more, to the cause: Selfridge's promised
 &#163;50,000; Harrod's, &#163;75,000; Ellerman Lines, &#163;1 million.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Business Men's Week was the highlight of an intensive campaign to sell
 war bonds which aimed to raise an average of &#163;25 million per week,
 every week, for about a year.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P>
Readers were encouraged to buy their war bonds from a tank, parked for
the week in Trafalgar Square. <I>The Times</I> explained:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A military pigeon post is being arranged to convey investors' cheques
to the Tank in Trafalgar-square. Special baskets of pigeons in charge
of soldiers will be on view in the Square. Those who wish to invest
amounts over a certain sum can be supplied with a pigeon which will be
taken by a soldier to their homes, where the cheque or application for
bonds can be inserted in the small metal holder on the leg of the bird,
which will then fly with it to the Tank in Trafalgar-square. The pigeons
will not accept cheques from outside the Greater London area.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It adds that "A special telephone exchange is being installed to serve
the six Tanks in the London area." Anyone who was interested simply had
to dial "Tanks, London."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P>
All over the country, fund-raising targets were set according to
the population of each center. Large cities such as Birmingham and
Liverpool promised to raise &#163;2.5 million each, enough to pay for a
super-dreadnought, while a tiny Welsh village hoped to raise enough to
buy one aeroplane.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 The logic of this method of selling war bonds was explained in an
 advertisement in the <I>Daily Express:</I>

Readers were urged to buy as many bonds as possible, to "help your own

<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 The advertisement constructs its readers, somewhat reluctantly, as
 free citizens rather than feudal subjects, but they were citizens under
 pressure to renew their consent to the war and to express that support
 visibly, in public.

The first day of Business Men's Week was very successful; in London
alone, &#163;4.5 million was raised.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 One tank was stationed behind the Royal Exchange, where business men were
 invited to go "Over the top of the City Tank" to buy their war bonds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Another tank (called Egbert) remained in Trafalgar Square (see <A
 HREF="4.1tate_2.html"> 2</A>), while four others roamed the
 boroughs of London, spending a day in each place, collecting money.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Almost all the named tank bank investors in the newspaper reports
 are large businesses, paying up to two million pounds each. But the
 organizers of



<B></B>



Business Men's Week also hoped that working-class people would invest
in war bonds, and activities were devised to attract punters from
all classes. <I>The Times</I> described the "attractions" provided in
Trafalgar Square: a display of model ships, launched by an admiral of
the United States navy, and a pigeon race at lunchtime with war bonds
as a prize.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Another tank was "in state" at Hackney, where a local shop, "camouflaged"
 as a trench, sold "war trophies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 A few days later, everyone in Fulham who bought war bonds was filmed, and
 the film screened in a local cinema; the best "tank smile" won a prize.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P>
On the final days of Business Men's Week, citizens were invited to choose
"British bonds to-day or German bondage to-morrow." MPs spoke from the
top of the tank in Trafalgar Square and the Lord Mayor of London dropped
a message from an airship, reminding Londoners of their duty. Altogether,
Tank Week raised &#163;135 million, much to the organizers' satisfaction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P>
Not long after they were invented, then, tanks appeared on the streets
of all the major British cities. (The first tank banks were introduced
the previous autumn, in November 1917, during the battle of Cambrai.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Contemporary reports suggest that civilians rather liked them. Even
 allowing for newspaper inaccuracies and propaganda, the evidence
 suggests that large numbers of people visited the tank banks and many
 bought war bonds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Others were less enthusiastic; Virginia Woolf, for example, acidly
 described a warm spring day in 1918, in which the sound of "Richmond
 worshipping a Tank was like the hum of bees round some first blossom."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 John Gould Fletcher complained in the <I>Egoist</I> in 1917 that
 Britain's attempt to destroy the German military machine had led to
 the invention of other, equally undesirable machines, including the
 tank and the war loan, "a machine to empty our pockets."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 In his 1918 essay "The New God," Fletcher likened the tank to a
 mechanical god, remarking ironically that its ability to collect money
 was "miraculous," and that buying war bonds had become a "religious
 ceremony."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P>
In the newspapers, by contrast,<I> </I>tank banks were represented as
entertainment for the populace, reported in phrases which weakly parody
the language of war: the "great offensive"; "go over the top"; and so
forth. All over the country, business, the press, and the state worked
together to provide official spectacles which aimed to generate laughter
and pleasure, and to regenerate support for the war. Tank banks became
the center of a kind of carnival--to which the popular musical <I>Chu
Chin Chow,</I> for example, sent a camel to buy &#163;10,000 of war bonds.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 As the <I>Daily Express</I> remarked with approval: "All that the Tank
 Fair needs is a coconut shy!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 In its editorial--entitled "Have You Tanked?"--the <I>Express</I>
 argued that people who fail to buy war bonds will "surely be marked
 with a blush"; and "the man without a tank certificate should be as
 uncomfortable as the man who has not shaved."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Citizens were offered a choice between communal pleasure (however
 fictitious) and social embarrassment. Consent becomes a form of personal
 hygiene, and those who refuse should carry a physical mark of shame.

<P>
The tank bank campaign was so successful that a similar project was
undertaken a few months later. Trevor Wilson describes the "Feed the
Guns" campaign, in which



<B></B>



Trafalgar Square was turned into a replica of a bombed French village,
with a shell-damaged church tower, wrecked farmhouse, etc. Twenty thousand
sandbags were brought in, and visitors were invited to "feed" the guns
on display with war bonds and certificates.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Here, again, civilians seem to have permitted the state to infantilize
 them; they enacted a fantasy of the war as a circus or fairground,
 replicated in bizarre simulacra in Trafalgar Square.

<P>
Yet tanks were not uncomplicatedly benign or entertaining presences on
city streets; the newspapers also admit that they look rather frightening
and seem to threaten violence towards the civilian population of their
own side.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 The idea of tanks turning against civilians surfaced just days after
 the tank first appeared in battle. The <I>Daily Mail</I> reported (or
 perhaps invented) a "hopeful man who said that after the war is over
 he will certainly hire one of the 'tanks' to clear his wife's relatives
 out of his house."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Sales at the first tank banks were reported in the <I>Daily Express,</I>
 half mockingly, as "Tank Draws First Blood," and the tank itself
 described as "a hungry monster," "his mouth wide open," like a
 hippopotamus at the zoo.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 A frightened child is assured that "he only bites Germans" and "purrs"
 when well fed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 In one newspaper advertisement, the tank is represented as a huge,
 looming presence--disproportionately large in comparison with the human
 res around it--shooting money out of its guns.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Sassoon's poem "Blighters" imagines--indeed, hopes for--a tank attack
 on civilians in a music hall: "I'd like to see a Tank come down the
 stalls / Lurching to rag-time tunes, or 'Home, Sweet Home.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 This is perhaps the best-known criticism of the use of tanks
 to trivialize the war, and it locates the blame entirely among
 civilians--especially women, the "prancing ranks of harlots" on the
 stage. Yet the processes which bring comic songs about tanks into
 popular entertainment are rather more complex than the poem allows.

<P>
The winter of 1917-1918 was perhaps the most difficult period of the
war. With a shortage of food and heating, a very cold winter, and no
end of the war in sight, there was a real possibility that the war might
become insupportable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 The cost was also a problem. How could support for the war be
 regenerated, especially among civilians, and how was it to be paid
 for? The early tanks might not have been very successful in battle,
 but they answered these political problems very nicely and transferred
 hundreds of millions of pounds out of bank savings and into the war. This
 had a profound effect on Britain's economy, as John Maynard Keynes
 later pointed out.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
Indeed, Britain, like the rest of Europe, ended the war severely in
debt; this had serious consequences in the decades which followed.

<P>
Contradictory discourses of pleasure, fear, and duty; infantilism,
community, and adulthood were employed to persuade and coerce the British
people to renew their support for the war during its most unpopular
period. This in turn raises questions about agency, and about what
it meant to be a citizen in the last few months of the war--a period
in which the franchise was extended from eight million to twenty-one
million voters.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Historians often note that the postwar revolutionary movements were
 much weaker in Britain than elsewhere in Europe, perhaps because of the



<B></B>



extension of the franchise. It is also possible that the particular ways
in which civilians were persuaded to consent to the war--including the
use of official carnivals around the weapons of war--may have been a
factor in post-war politics. Such a claim can only be speculative; we
cannot know what would have happened without the propaganda, censorship,
tank banks, and so forth. But the success of the pro-war campaigns is
highly suggestive; particularly significant is their ability to produce
a fantasmatic, infantile, <I>and pleasurable</I> relationship to the
war and its objects. The tank provided both fictions and fantasies as
well as a physical presence and "commanding personality" around which
people gathered, voluntarily, and about which they dreamed.

 In short, it played a vital role in what Walter Lippmann termed the
 "manufacture of consent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>

<P>
Overall, between October 1917 and September 1918, war bonds raised
&#163;1,000 million, an achievement which, as Trevor Wilson argues,
caused considerable hardship among poorer people, especially as taxes
and postage costs were increased around the same time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 This was the tanks' most successful campaign.

2. The Invention of the Tank
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Intense secrecy surrounded the development and manufacture of the
tank. The name "tank" was chosen as a disguise, and the early tanks were
passed off as water-tanks, supposedly to be exported to Russia in boxes
labelled "With Care to Petrograd."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Strange stories circulated about the origins of the tank; after the
 war, many different people claimed to have invented it, and a Royal
 Commission was set up to decide on its true parents, and to reward them
 with large sums of money.

<P>
A prototype was tested in the summer of 1915, using the caterpillar track,
recently invented for American tractors. As a result of these tests, a
track of pressed steel was developed and wrapped around the entire body
of the tank, producing the characteristic rhomboid shape. The tracks
did not actually move across the ground; rather, a lot of small sprocket
wheels drove the body along its own tracks. As Mitchell explains, "the
tank laid its own track, drove along it, then picked it up behind, and
passed it over its head before laying it down in front again."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 Or as Mary Borden puts it in her tank poem, "They moved slowly along
 on their stomachs / Dragging themselves forward by their ears."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>

<P>
The tank looks completely self-sufficient; this pleases many early
observers. From the outside, the crew is completely hidden; what you
see is a machine which appears to drive itself, fire its own guns, and
even provide its own road. The tank looked like a completely new kind of
mechanical warfare, and it generated intense excitement among journalists
and propagandists. It was greeted with less enthusiasm by the army and
the war office. Their ambivalence has been dismissed as conservative,
narrow minded, and driven by an excessive love of cavalry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Perhaps so, but it is also worth noting that the tank consumed large
 quantities of money, labor, steel, and so forth at a time of scarcity,
 and was actually not very good at negotiating a muddy landscape. Even
 in their most successful battle, at Cambrai in November 1917, the



<B></B>



tanks could not hold the ground they had won, and almost all the gains
were lost a few days later, with approximately forty-five thousand
casualties on each side.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Despite these failures, the tank <I>appeared</I> to offer protection
 to the vulnerable human body. Many writers describe the Great War as a
 war of machines against men, with the machines always winning. The tank
 seems, however ineptly, to provide a shield--to protect soldiers from
 the terrible damage of machine-gun bullets and artillery. In short, the
 tank promises to reduce the hideous abjection of the war; this alone
 altered the fantasmatic relationship between the human body and modern
 warfare, both for soldiers and for civilians.

<P>
The Great War is often discussed as if it were a complete break with
the past; an abyss which separates the nineteenth century from modernism
or modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 This re can be traced in a number of writings from the period, but
 equally we find the war and its objects placed in an almost seamless
 continuity with the past, especially in military writings. A bizarre
 range of antecedants was discovered for the tank: the Roman testudo,
 knights in armor, armored elephants, Leonardo's lost drawings of
 a horse-drawn tank, Dante's invention of the tank in the <I>Divine
 Comedy,</I> H. G. Wells's land ironclads.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Even today, the Bovington Tank Museum locates its objects in antiquity;
 its exhibition of First World War tanks opens with a quotation from the
 Bible: "And the Lord was with Judah: and he drove out the inhabitants
 of the mountain: but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the
 valley, because they had chariots of iron."

3. The Language of the Tank
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The first successful tank was named Little Willie. Little Willie was
too short, and was replaced by a larger model: Big Willie.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 The larger model was the basis of all the early tanks which were used
 in battle, and was immediately renamed Mother--"as it was the first of
 all tanks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 Here the language becomes extremely complex, for Mother came in two
 forms: male and female. (There were also "hermaphrodite" tanks.) The
 sex of the tank was determined by relatively minor variations: the male
 was a little larger and weighed twenty-eight tons; the female weighed
 twenty-seven tons. The male had two kinds of guns; the female only one
 (though both carried a total of six guns). Perhaps most significantly
 from the crew's point of view, in the early models the male had a narrow
 door in the side, allowing men to escape, with difficulty, if the tank
 caught fire. The female by contrast had only a small trap door, only
 two feet high, out of which it was almost impossible to escape.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 This was soon modified, but in the earliest tanks, being inside a female
 Mother was one of the men's worst nightmares: it was a place in which
 they could be trapped and burned alive. Tank driver Jenkin notes that
 the men "most favoured" the male Mothers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>

<P>
Drivers took up the terminology, but were inclined to refer to "my bus" or
"my Willie" rather than "my Mother."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 The language of Willie and Mother, male, female, and hermaphrodite,
 is scattered throughout the early tank writings with an air of ironic
 innocence. Mitchell for example writes of the "adventurous male";
 "determined male"; "all-conquering female"; "female man-killers." "Would
 the old 'Willie'



<B></B>



break down suddenly when in the midst of the enemy?" worries a driver
before his first attack. On her first trial, reports Mitchell, Mother
"behaved splendidly."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 The <I>Illustrated London News</I> presents a picture of a female
 Mother--"'The Perfect Lady' about to cross a trench." A book by the
 engineering firm William Foster and Co. reproduces several photographs
 of Mother: "'Mother' negotiates her first trench," "A Supply Tank
 . . . evolved from 'Mother,'" and a banner from Foster's factory:
 "Welcome to the Birthplace of the Tanks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Many of the early tank writings employ an excess of metaphors of birth,
 conception, evolution, and fathering of the tank; the men who will
 later squabble over the money and glory allocated to the inventor of
 the tank claim to have given birth--to Mother.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 Once she is invented, "Mother" becomes a highly mobile and at times
 perverse re in the language of the tank--a source of simultaneous
 pleasure and terror, protection and violence and even a bizarre
 kind of tenderness. In a piece written long after the war, Henry
 Williamson tells a tank anecdote from Field Marshall Hindenburg's
 autobiography. Hindenburg, says Williamson, recalls the sight, towards
 the end of the war, of "a British Tommy sitting wounded by a knocked-out
 tank, holding the hand of a dying sixteen-year-old German boy, and
 saying, as the lad cried out <I>'Mutti--Mutti,'</I> 'It's all right
 chum, Mother's here with you.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>

<P>
The tank produced new ways of imagining warfare, the human body, and
structures of difference. For most British people, both soldiers and
civilians, the tank represents an <I>idea.</I> Industrial warfare produces
new terrors. In theory, at least, you can hide inside a machine known as
both Willie and Mother and drive through a dangerous landscape, crushing
your enemies in your path. At the same time, you worry that Willie or
Mother is threatening to mutilate or destroy you, and possibly take all
your money, in uncanny anticipation of the work of Melanie Klein. Such
fantasies are available to both women and men <I>as fantasies,</I> and
are articulated repeatedly in the writings, films, and photographs of
the tank. The crucial difference between subjects in an industrial war
is located less in sexual difference than in the distinction between
combatants and civilians.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 Or, more precisely, between those inside and those outside the
 sublime object of the tank. Those inside often wrote about their
 experiences. Tank memoirs and tank histories appeared throughout the
 1920s and 1930s; many were reviewed in journals such as the <I>TLS.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 In the final section, I will look briefly at Arthur Jenkin's <I>A Tank
 Driver's Experiences</I> , F. Mitchell's <I>Tank Warfare</I>
 , and the autobiography of tank driver and psychoanalyst, Wilfred
 Bion. These works offer gripping accounts of how the early tank was
 imagined long after its technology had been superseded.

4. Tank Drivers' Memoirs
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
All the weapons of the Great War were to some extent spectacles, but
none more so than the tank. Unlike machine guns or artillery, the tank
actually killed very few people. Its early engagements hinged largely
on the question of theater: how could it best exploit how it looked? The
drivers' memoirs are fascinated by the implacable



<B></B>



body of the tank and the differences it produces between inside and
outside. Both positions are extremely dangerous and each provides a
new fantasy relationship between the soldier's body and the sources of
danger. Most of the crew are devoted to the machine and determined to
make it work; at the same time it inspires a profound terror and rage
when it fails to protect them.

<P>
Both Jenkin and Mitchell provide detailed descriptions of conditions
inside the tank. With the crew crowded around the large engine and heat
rising above one hundred degrees, the interior of the tank was, as Jenkin
remarks, "a veritable hell" for the men inside:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[M]achine-gun bullets beat like hail upon the outside, from which hot
splinters pricked the gunners' faces, whilst shells could be heard
bursting in close proximity. Inside, above the noise of the engine,
was heard the sharp cracking of our own machine guns, mingled with the
groaning and whining of the gunner who lay stretched along the blood
and oil-saturated floor; this, with the vomiting of our second driver,
intense heat, exhaust petrol fumes, and nauseous vapour from the guns
made an inferno that no outside observer would have thought possible to
exist within those steel plates.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The crew are also terrified that the tank will catch fire. Yet the tank is
also a place that--in theory, at least--will protect them from danger. Men
are placed inside Mother; at the same time they <I>are</I> Mother--much
is made of the fact that the crew of eight works as a single, disciplined
body. All but one of them function as limbs, working the machine and the
guns; the eighth is the brains of the outfit and does the navigating. The
early tank in action is a completely self-contained unit, cut off from
the outside world; a single, complex body within its own carapace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>

<P>
Sitting inside Mother, the crew could see almost nothing outside. Paul
Virilio argues that the technology of cinema began to replace the act
of looking in the Great War.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 In the tank, looking was replaced by aerial photographs, and the
 commander navigated at one remove. No one inside the tank could actually
 see where they were going.
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 To protect their faces from sparks and debris, the crew often wore
 chain-mail masks which reduced visibility even further. Almost blind,
 navigating with aerial photographs which could be out of date within
 hours, the tank crew were, according to Mitchell, "like an ostrich with
 its head in the sand" (<I>TW. </I>153)--a position which he says gave
 them plenty of courage. Yet Mitchell and Jenkin also describe some of
 the horrible injuries sustained in tank warfare. When Jenkin's tank is
 hit with a high explosive shell, the steel plate of the tank is severed
 "as if it were matchwood" (<I>TDE,</I> 180). He loses the use of his
 arm, drags himself out of the tank, and finds himself "lying exhausted
 and alone," in terrible pain and suffering from "the indescribable
 feelings produced by [engine] fumes upon an empty stomach" (<I>TDE,</I>
 182). Later, in hospital, his arm is amputated without his knowledge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF82" HREF="#FOOT82">82</a></SUP>
 Jenkin provides very little description of physical suffering, yet his
 memoir is disturbing precisely because of its ambivalence. He loves
 the tank, but it has failed to save him from mutilation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>

HREF="4.1tate_3.html">

ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/4.1tate_3b.gif"></A>


The tank also produces a new relationship to the notion of work. Both
Jenkin and Mitchell describe the labor involved in driving and maintaining
the tank. It takes



<B></B>



days of intensive labor transporting a tank, digging it out of
ditches, getting it across railway lines, repairing the engine, and
so forth. Much of this work was instantly rendered futile when tanks
became bogged beyond salvage or wrecked by shell fire. Many tanks never
reached a battle, but had to be abandoned; in some areas the landscape
was littered with these enormous pieces of expensive rubbish (see <A
HREF="4.1tate_3.html"> 3</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 After one failed battle, Mitchell recalls the sight of "eight huge
 carcasses . . . , some battered beyond recognition, others lifting
 their snouts pathetically beyond the slimy waters" (<I>TW,</I> 125).
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 Derelict tanks blocked the road and had to be blown up--a dangerous
 undertaking which took about a week. The world's first industrial war
 generated large-scale industrial waste--a sight which was kept well
 hidden from the civilians buying their millions of pounds' worth of
 war bonds at precisely the same time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>

<P>
The autobiography of Wilfred Bion is also preoccupied with the strange
relationship between inside and outside produced by the tank. Unlike
most other tank writers, Bion doesn't like the tank much. He hates being
inside "the cursed thing" --and is terrified of being outside it,
as well. (Early tank commanders often walked in front of their tanks
into battle; as a new branch of the army, the Tank Corps was trying
to establish its reputation for courage and honor, and the crews took
considerable risks to



<B></B>



achieve this.) When a civilian woman asks what it feels like when his
tank runs over people, Bion doesn't know, but he does recall being
"possessed" by the terrible fear that he would fall wounded and be run
over by his own tank (130, 266).

<P>
Bion represents himself as an incompetent soldier and a hopeless tank
commander. All his memories of battle are nightmarish: the men don't
know where they are going; the orders don't make sense; men are killed,
pointlessly. By the time he comes to his third tank engagement, Bion
is simultaneously terrified and cynical about the plans for battle. The
crew is exhausted, Bion is confused, the orders are insane. "They were
not orders," he writes, "they were sentences of death" . Instead
of starting at dawn, the tanks are ordered to attack at 10:30 in the
morning. Here Bion provides a rare description of a tank commander's
view from the outside of his tank:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The tanks were hidden, each under a small clump of trees very conveniently
placed, separated by an average interval of fifty yards from each
other. At 10.25 they emerged and drove to cross the front line of
the division at 10.30. There was no gunfire, no machine-gun fire. As
the tanks crossed the line the enemy machine guns opened up. I walked
behind Greene's tank hoping, by being as close as possible, to escape
the machine-gun fire.

. . . Hauser, who had gone into action sitting on the back of one of
the two tanks under his immediate command, had also run back to see
what had happened. It was uncanny; nothing had happened--that's what
had happened. But he was unmistakably terrified; we both were--and both
perfectly safe in the trench. The troops might have been sleep-walking.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We looked at the tanks; they had nothing wrong with them. They were
quietly purring their way forward and were already too far away to
catch up with them even if we wanted to do so. As there was no method
of communication, wireless or otherwise, we could only stand and watch,
the Colonel almost demented, Hauser and I ghost-ridden.

The tanks rolled up a gentle grassy slope. There was a soft muffled
explosion. Robertson's tank opened as a flower in a nature film might
unfold. Another thud; then two, almost simultaneous, followed. The
whole four had flowered. Hard, bright flames, as if cut out of tinfoil,
flickered and died, extinguished by the bright sun. One tank, crewless,
went on to claw at the back of one in front as if preparatory to
love-making; then stopped as if exhausted. [254]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
"We stared, fascinated," says Bion. Later he learns that the Staff have
ordered the tanks to carry high explosives, so they can be blown up if
they are captured by the Germans, which makes them rather vulnerable
if they get hit. The extraordinary vision of the tanks opening "like
blossoms greeting the sun" , with his crew inside, disturbs Bion
terribly, but it also teaches him something useful. In the next battle, he
is inspired to tell the crew to jump out; he will drive the tank alone,
steering a zig-zag course. His men leave, then Bion remembers that it
takes the entire crew to steer the tank; all he can do is drive it in a
straight line, under the gaze of lots of observation balloons. He opens
the throttle, and leaps out. The empty tank races forwards; nothing
fires on it; Bion realizes he has just made a gift to the enemy of
"a fully equipped tank in complete working order." He runs after it,
presumably in the



<B></B>



hope of getting it back again. Then, he says, "mercifully a shell hit,
pierced and burst. The tank stopped, flames spurting everywhere. In a
moment it was a total wreck" . Bion knows that he (and the crew)
should have stayed in the tank, even though they would certainly have
been killed. Yet in a way honor is satisfied; the tank went into battle
on a useless mission; it was hit, as it must have been. And the crew is
alive, rather than pointlessly dead. Here, as elsewhere in this book,
tank activity is partly an elaborate masquerade, a simulacrum of warfare,
enacted at a safe distance.

<P>
One fantasy generated by the tank was that future wars would be fought
entirely by machines, who would do the dying for us. The tank seems
to promise new kinds of agency--enabling the human body to enter zones
which were previously impenetrable--at the same time as it negates agency
and displaces the human subject from the narratives of war. This human
subject, like evolution, is imagined as moving simultaneously forwards
into the machine age and backwards into the primeval slime--a movement
both terrifying and pleasurable. Bion's memoir, written in the 1970s, is
written against this fantasy through the knowledge of what war actually
did become; he reads the Great War backwards through the human suffering
of Vietnam, Korea, the Cold War, Hiroshima, Fascism, and other disasters
of the twentieth century, all of which owe a good deal to the technical,
political, and imaginative developments of 1914-1918.

<p>
The publication of Otto Weininger's <I>Sex and Character (Geschlecht
und Charakter) </I>in May 1903 evolved within a few months into one of
those literary events that bring apparently disparate cultural trends
into striking focus, that gather the inchoate anxieties and obsessions
of an age (or its literate, self-styled spokespersons) into provocative,
synthesizing outline. The book quickly became an international bestseller
and a reference point for countless diary entries, journal articles,
and coffeehouse discussions, going through twenty-five editions in
twenty years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The short and unhappy life of its twenty-three year old author, who
 shot himself in melodramatic fashion in October, 1903, in the house in
 which Beethoven had died, added the celebrity of scandal as well as the
 seductions of a personal tragedy lived out in radical authenticity to the
 exemplary qualities of this mirror of the age. Reading Weininger's work
 in the 1990s, however, it is difficult to imagine how such a cartoonishly
 hyperbolic, pretentiously philosophical, maniacally simplifying book,
 throbbing with uncontrolled misogynist and anti-Semitic feelings, could
 become the focus of intense concern for a broad and sophisticated
 audience of artists, writers, and scholars. This audience included
 the Austrian modernists Arnold Schoenberg, Adolf Loos, Karl Kraus,
 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Oskar Kokoschka, Sigmund Freud, Georg Trakl, Franz
 Kafka, Heimito Von Doderer, Hermann Broch, and Robert Musil, as well
 as modernists outside of Austria and Germany,



<B></B>



like August Strindberg, D. H. Lawrence, and the Italian Futurists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Wonder at the Weininger phenomenon spurs historical questions and
 invites us to reexamine the connections between the three issues that
 were welded together in his work's distorting and simplifying mirror:
 the production of masculine identity out of universal bisexuality;
 the definition of the boundaries of community or "home" through the
 projection of psychic division on to the relations between social and
 cultural groups, and the problematic resolution of the intractable
 polarities of historical existence in aesthetic or philosophical
 transcendence, in the translation of life into art, of impure material
 and historical existence into abstract, spiritual form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
The most obvious and dominating of these three dimensions in Weininger's
text was his conceptualization of sexual/gender polarization. <I>Sex
and Character </I>was organized around the principled assertion
that the difference between masculine and feminine natures did not
arise as a generalization from observed attributes of male and female
individuals but constituted a polarity of ideal-typical modes of being (or
"characters") emerging from a duality of biological, "vital" substances
unevenly distributed across the whole spectrum of plant, animal, and
human life. "Living beings cannot be described bluntly as one sex or the
other," Weininger wrote. "The real world from the point of view of sex
may be regarded as wavering or oscillating <I>(schwanken) </I>between
two points. No empirical individual being actually exists at either
point, but somewhere between the two."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 What began in the first part of the book as a scientific theory
 of biological bisexuality in which the relative ratios of "M"
 (masculinity) and "W" (femininity) in any individual could be quantified
 in mathematical terms, was transformed in the second and major part
 of Weininger's study into a speculative, theoretical (philosophical)
 construction of a dynamic dualism of essences. "Masculinity" designated
 the pole of conscious subjective agency, rational control, ethical
 individuality, freedom and spiritual transcendence (all epitomized as
 "being") and "femininity" designated the pole of unconscious objective
 passivity, sexual determinism, amorality, and material de-individualized
 immanence (summarized as nonbeing or "nothing").

<P>
The logical rigor of this polarization (essentially a pseudo-scientific
stylization of conventional sexual stereotypes) was combined with an
ethical puritanism in which the feminine operated as that which needed
to be expunged in order for the self to attain the essential, human ideal
of pure masculinity. Conceptual femininity did not refer to actual women,
Weininger insisted, but was a projection of the negative other constructed
by the masculine within men as they struggled to overcome the effeminacy
of sexuality within themselves. "Woman" existed only as long as "man's"
guilt remained unexpiated, his sexuality unconquered (<I>GC,</I> 456;
<I>SC,</I> 344). Weininger denied that his theory was directed against
actual existing women; the average bisexual woman was also presented with
the existential possibility and moral task of vanquishing her femininity
and attaining the ideal of pure masculinity. But his allegedly scientific
theory of the relative bisexual ratios in men and women made his text
appear like an attack on women in the contemporary battle of the sexes
rather than a universalizable theory of ethical transcendence. The text
moves with breathtaking



<B></B>



 ease from the analysis of abstract types to the critique of existing
 individuals and groups.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Masculine identity within any particular individual, though supported
 by quantitative ratios of biological substance, emerged as primarily
 a human construct, an ethical and cultural achievement. Femininity was
 also a construct, but always and only in a negative sense; it was not a
 true identity, not a goal of human achievement or a potential product of
 a process of self-determination, but "something which can be transcended,
 which ought to be transcended" <I>(etwas, das aufgehoben werden kann, und
 aufgehoben werden soll </I>[<I>GC,</I> 456; <I>SC,</I> 344]). Masculinity
 was also contingent, but only in the sense that it's fulfillment was
 marked by its disappearance into the universal essence of humanity.

<P>
<I>Sex and Character </I>combined this radical polarization of
masculine and feminine with a racial/cultural theory built on a parallel
polarization of Aryan and Jewish types. Jewishness in Weininger's theory
was the collective form of femininity as it operated in the history
of Western culture. The historical goal of constructing a community of
autonomous, rational, self-legislating subjects (the Kantian Kingdom of
Ends) was tied to the attainment of Aryan masculinity and the repudiation
of Jewishness. Jewishness, as femininity's historical/cultural form, was
also not identical with a particular biological population or nation, but
presented as the ideal-type of a "psychological constitution, which is
a possibility for all humankind but which has found its most grandiose
actualization in historical Judaism" (<I>GC,</I> 406; <I>SC,</I> 303).
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
Anti-Semitism as a cultural and political movement was thus grounded
on a psychological displacement of the struggle against the Jewishness
in everyone on to a struggle against a specific group of individuals
whose relative quantity of Jewishness was particularly high; it emerged
as an expression of the general human struggle to attain the goal of
autonomous moral selfhood. To achieve the emancipated human identity
of autonomous individuality was to repudiate the woman and the Jew in
oneself. The true home for "Man" was, by definition, an Aryan fraternity
in which femininity and Jewishness had been repudiated and expunged. The
sexual, moral and political dimensions of this quest for autonomy were
difficult to disentangle: Jewishness "was saturated with femininity"
<I>(das Judentum durchtr&auml;nkt scheint von . . . Weiblichkeit
</I>[<I>GS,</I> 409; <I>SC,</I> 306]).

<P>
To achieve pure masculinity, to progress in the task of overcoming
mere existence and attaining a genuinely human essence, to be a
self-sufficient, autonomous human being--these goals were approached in
the historical, human activities of art and philosophy. In both art and
philosophy, at least as produced by the genius--the human exemplar who
approached most closely the translucent autonomous self-consciousness of
the purely masculine--attention was focused on the transcendent, on the
timeless forms from which all existence in time derived its meaning. In
Weininger's universe, the realm of high culture was a product of higher
beings who incarnated the highest in everyone, who educated their fellows
in the moral task of repudiating their sensual being (femininity and
Jewishness), and who interrupted the causal and functional networks
of material/historical existence with epiphanies of timeless spiritual
form. Such activities had been corrupted, become decadent, in



<B></B>



those fin-de-si&egrave;cle artistic and philosophical movements that
surrendered to the seductive pull of the sensually contingent. Drawing
heavily on artistic heroes such as Wagner and Ibsen, Weininger called for
a more purified and autonomous art, an art that mirrored, articulated,
and thus helped to achieve the redemptive goal of spiritual transcendence,
of purified masculinity.

<P>
For Weininger the achievement of identity was not tied to the incarnation
of meaning in time through narrative coherence, but through the
repudiation of time in the achievement of timeless truths. Yet inevitably
some of his contemporaries tended to see meaningful connections between
Weininger's theories and his suicide. They thus turned his repudiation
of existence in time into a story about a failed struggle for meaning in
time. It became either a pathological case of identity shipwreck, or an
exemplary story of a heroic and tragic struggle for masculine and national
identity within the apparently intractable contradictions of a fallen
world. In this paper I will analyze the texts of a number of Weininger's
Austrian contemporaries who were able to transform the polarities involved
in this modernist crisis of identity into stories of the refashioning
of masculine identity that were both diagnostic and exemplary, that
found a problematic meaning in processes of constructing personal
and cultural identity within the contingencies of embodied temporal
existence. Weininger was not viewed as a solution in these writings (as
he was at times in the works of August Strindberg or Karl Kraus), but
transformed into a case whose conditions of possibility required critical
analysis before its materials could be shaped into meaningful narrative
form. In texts published by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), Arthur Schnitzler
(1862-1931), and Robert Musil (1880-1942) in the decade before World
War I, Weininger's drive to achieve masculine identity and his search
for a communal home were not in any way resolved through the discovery
of true masculinity or of a satisfactory homeland. Literary art and
systematic reflection on the conditions of experience were mobilized not
as instruments for resolution or transcendence but as a means to portray,
as the distinguishing core of the modernist identity itself, a conception
of the interminable, experimental, contingent, conflicted processes of
constructing gendered and communal identities. These exemplars of early
Austrian modernism were thus not marked so much by a consciousness of the
end of the story or the collapse of the narrative, the absence of meaning
in time, as by the reconstruction of narrative coherence and meaning in
time in a new, open, and self-reflexive form. Moreover, the construction
of narrative meaning was not perceived as an act of transcendence, but
placed in the service of a this-worldly ethical task, the practical yet
interminable work of constructing autonomy.

I. The Freudian Case History as a Story of Masculine Identity Formation
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The emergence and development of psychoanalysis as a distinctive
theoretical perspective, therapeutic method, and scientific movement in
the first decade of the twentieth century was inextricably entangled
in the complex crisis of masculine identity so starkly portrayed in
Weininger's book and played out in his life. Such entanglements



<B></B>



 involved both the psychopathological material which was the
 object of psychoanalytic diagnosis and therapy and the motivating
 intentions and organizing categories of this theory and practice. The
 problematic construction of human subjectivity as a construction of
 either masculine or feminine subjectivity was at the very center of
 the unconscious psychosexual structures, mechanisms, and conflicts
 which Freud presented as the discovery of a new continent mapped by
 psychoanalytic knowledge. The five classic Freudian case studies which
 Freud investigated and prepared for publication in the decade before
 World War I were, among all of the founding psychoanalytic texts of
 the early twentieth century, the most revealing of the ways in which
 the Freudian theories of the dynamic structures of unconscious mental
 life and convoluted pathways of sexual desire merged in the subjective
 problematic of constructing masculine and feminine identities. In these
 cases Freud not only worked out the conditions for the constitution of
 a workable or livable gendered identity within the psychopathological
 conflicts of his patients, but wrote out and worked out his own struggle
 to establish a satisfactory masculine identity as well. An investigation
 of three issues within these stories seems particularly relevant for a
 historical reconstruction of the relations between the psychoanalytic
 science of gender construction and modernist fictions of masculinity in
 crisis--the connections between biological bisexuality and the cultural
 construction of individualized gendered identities, the repudiation of
 femininity in the construction of masculine identity, and the repression
 of passive homoeroticism in the production of masculine autonomy.

<P>
Freud's explicit encounter with the author and text of <I>Sex and
Character</I> actually occurred before its publication in 1903 and became
the center of a complicated controversy over scientific priority in the
discovery of bisexuality, a controversy in which differing conceptions
of the meaning of bisexuality played a prominent role.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In July 1904, Wilhelm Fliess, the Berlin sexual biologist who
 had been Freud's closest friend and confidante in the late 1890s,
 accused Freud of breaking confidence and passing on Fliess's theory
 of organic bisexuality to a friend of Weininger's (Hermann Swoboda),
 an indiscretion which eventually produced its effect in <I>Sex and
 Character</I>, where Fliess's intellectual property was claimed by
 Weininger as his own. Although Freud acknowledged that he might have
 provided Weininger with the key used to rob Fliess's house, his exchange
 with Fliess revealed the extent to which Freud differed from both Fliess
 and Weininger in his understanding of the significance of bisexuality. On
 the one hand, Freud seemed to think that the general biological theory
 of a constitutional, organic bisexuality was both widespread in the
 scientific literature (Fliess's originality was thus reduced to details
 and implications that others might themselves have been able to deduce
 from the principle without stealing his ideas) and not particularly
 relevant for explaining the ways in which the body's energies were
 lived out in the psychosexual conflicts of gendered identity formation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
Already in 1901 Freud had felt insulted by Fliess's insinuation
that Freud's psychological analysis of the neurotic articulations of
psychosexual conflict constituted subjective projections of Freud's own
wishes and thoughts on to evidence that could be



<B></B>



explained quite adequately through knowledge of the bisexual nature of
vital processes, such as periodic biorhythms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Although Freud begun using the concept of bisexuality in his analyses
 as early as 1896, he persistently and increasingly relegated biological
 bisexuality to the category of an organic predisposition, a precondition
 of psychosexual conflict, but not in any way a principle that could
 explain the particularities of that conflict. When Weininger presented
 Freud with an early version of his text in 1901, in the hope of gaining
 his support in finding a publisher, Freud had criticized the work for
 the same kind of speculative and dogmatic reductionism he had discerned
 in Fliess.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 A decade later Freud would discern a similarly reductive tendency
 in Alfred Adler's claim that an inherent "masculine protest" against
 the threat of feminization was the key to understanding psychosexual
 conflict. Any such masculine protest, he insisted, would have to be
 explained as itself a product of the complex conflictual relations of
 psychosexual wishing, contextualized within the history of desire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 In the claims of Fliess, Weininger, and Adler, Freud detected a
 reductivism which threatened to undermine the legitimacy of his own
 emerging science of unconscious psychic reality. At the core of these
 claims was a view of identity formation, a story of how humans came to
 be encultured men and woman, which submerged the historical contingency
 of the individual life story in the conflictual processes of vital
 substances or cultural essences. In each case, moreover, the theories had
 a tendency to become symptomatic, neurotically self-alienating, rather
 than analytical and reflexive, because they ignored the participation
 of the theorist in his theory.

<P>
Freud's own case histories can be construed as attempts to produce
convincing stories of the struggle to construct gendered individual
identities which would avoid the reductivism of his rivals. At the
same time they were the textual sites on which he established his own
identity as the knower of these psychic processes, an identity which
was itself entangled in his battle to achieve masculine self-control and
autonomy. The first properly psychoanalytic case study, "Fragment of an
Analysis of a Case of Hysteria" (commonly known as "Dora"), was written
during the first weeks of 1901, at the critical moment of Freud's decisive
break with Fliess and his assertion of the autonomy of psychoanalysis,
and it displays some of the distinctive components of the Freudian story
of gendered identity formation in exemplary form.

<P>
In "Dora" the achievement of gendered identity is described not as
an expression of biological nature, the fulfillment of a preordained
metaphysical essence, nor as a socially imposed role, but as an effect
constituted in a network of culturally conditioned relations. Although
Freud assumes an organic bisexuality as a starting point, his analysis
is focused on the ways in which Dora's conflicts are formed by her
unconscious desires for, and identifications with, an overlapping
multiplicity and confusion of relevant others of both genders. Dora's
psychological conflicts relate partly to her difficulty in conforming to
unconsciously assimilated cultural norms of femininity imposed through
these desires and identifications, partly to her hostility to repudiating
the masculine and homoerotic tendencies which prevented her from becoming
a normal woman.



<B></B>

<P>
Freud's account of Dora's struggle to achieve self-consciousness and
control of her unconscious conflicts concerning her gendered identity
is entangled in the often inadvertent telling of his own struggle to
impose his control (as a masculine, paternal, scientifically disciplined
subject) over her. The case history is a story of Freud's (failed) attempt
to assert his masculine identity by convincing Dora to take upon herself
the construction of a normative femininity as a self-conscious ethical
task. "Dora" is not just an account of Dora's illness, but also a story
of the therapeutic encounter, which is as much a story about Freud as
about her.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P>
In writing "Dora," Freud was acutely self-conscious of the problems
involved in constructing a convincing narrative account of the
psychological history of an individual subject. He differentiated the
psychoanalytic story, which reconstructs and examines the conditions
of narrative coherence in its own telling, from those kinds of stories
that simply assume an unproblematic coherence in the representations of
external biological or social realities. Such glib and smooth accounts,
unaware of the problematic nature of their own telling, were in fact
symptomatic. They displayed a disavowal of the unconscious psychic
conflicts which underlay the construction of coherence. Further, Freud
was intent on distinguishing his own construction of coherence from
the fictions of novelists. The imaginative writer's need to create a
coherent story, he insisted, involved censorship, simplification, and
abstraction. The complicated structural layering of psychic life and the
overdetermination of events within the realm of unconscious relations (the
synchronic rather than diachronic relations between pasts and presents)
could be represented only through the analytic hypothetical models of
the scientist. In the same way, the impersonal and dry language of the
scientist assserted its superiority over the concrete language of the
storyteller in the telling of stories that contained within themselves
an analytic perspective on the conditions of their own story-making.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P>
The analytic perspective which Freud saw as providing the necessary
reflexive distance in constructing stories of identity formation,
however, was itself organized as a kind of meta-story of various oedipal
relations. By 1909 Freud had begun to define the aggregate of complexes
which came together at the moment of the infantile enculturation of
desire as the nuclear complex of psychosexual development. It was from
the perspective of the Oedipus complex that Freud, in 1909, was able
to view Weininger's <I>Sex and Character</I> as a symptomatic work of
a "sexually disturbed young philosopher" and "neurotic." Weininger's
uncontrolled hostility toward women and Jews, Freud stated, was a product
of his neurotic regression to the unconscious infantile relations of the
castration complex, in which circumcised Jews and penis-lacking women
both gave imaginary shape to the fear of castration. Weininger's text
made sense within the story of a little Oedipus who felt threatened with
the loss of his very existence if he did not renounce his sexual desires
and submit to the "spiritual" authority of the father's law.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P>
In the decade after the publication of "Dora" there was one complex
in the constellation of infantile sexual conflicts that seemed to draw
Freud's particular attention



<B></B>



 and to arouse his narrative productivity--the unsuccessful working
 through of ambivalent relations to the father re. This father
 complex produced a tendency toward obsessional neuroses, regression to
 the libidinal stage of anal eroticism, and the assumption of a passive
 feminine or homosexual position toward patriarchal authority. Freud's
 fascination with resolving the puzzle of such cases was a continuation
 of his attempts to work through his relationship to Fliess, as well as
 an expression of his desire to understand the unconscious dimensions in
 his problematic relations to the intellectual sons who gathered around
 him in the psychoanalytic movement after 1905. To attain a satisfactory
 masculine identity as an autonomous, law-abiding son was to work through
 the homosexual libido involved in the son's relation to the father in
 ways that did not encourage regression to the anal-sadistic stage and
 the formation of obsessional neuroses, but mobilized homosexual libido
 through the sublimated form of intellectual creativity and devotion to
 the "general interests of humanity," or at least (within the context of
 the psychoanalytic movement) devotion to the "cause" of psychoanalysis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 As a form of narcissistic love for individuals like oneself, homosexual
 impulses produced within the oedipal constellation formed the basis
 for social bonding, both between generations of fathers and sons and
 between "brothers," that is, they became the starting point for a human
 community or "mankind" defined as a masculine cultural form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P>
In 1910 Freud extended his investigation of the "effeminate," emasculating
seductions of homosexual libido, shifting his attention from the
therapeutic relations inside his consulting room to the construction of
masculine subjectivities outside, broadening his attempts to understand
the various experimental lives which could be constructed from a common
nuclear constellation of psychosexual conflicts structured by the
oedipal complex. In "Leonardo Da Vinci and a Memory of his Childhood,"
Freud produced a speculative reconstruction, a "psychoanalytic novel"
(<I>pyschoanalytischer Roman)</I> of the possible ways in which the
working through of homosexual libidinal impulses, formed in the particular
identifications and repressions that marked the transformation of the
infant "into a civilized human being" (<I>zum Kulturmenschen)</I>, could
lead to the self-consciously critical, investigative activities of the
scientific researcher or to the sublimated eroticism of the creative
artist, or, as in Leonardo's case, to a life-long oscillation between
the two.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Freud's Leonardo story was not simply the account of an obsessional
 neurosis or the transcendent power of genius to rise above the common
 fate, but a reconstructed story of the particular way in which the
 structures of a common fate could be lived. It was not a model to
 be emulated or rejected, but a story that could contribute to a
 self-understanding of the potentialities and limits of living one's
 life as a masculine subject.

<P>
Freud's extended commentary ("Psychoanalytic Notes") on the published
autobiography of a mental patient, the "Memoirs of my Nervous Illness"
written by the German judge Daniel Paul Schreber, would seem to lie
at the opposite end of the spectrum of possible masculine identity
formations from that portrayed in "Leonardo." But in this case as well
Freud thought that his oedipal key had provided a method for unriddling
the mystery of a particular life. And as in the case of



<B></B>



Leonardo, Freud was drawn to Schreber's text at least in part because
it exemplified for him one of the possible ways he might have lived out
his own masculine identity crisis. In letters written on the same day
(3 December 1910) to Carl Gustav Jung and Sandor Ferenczi, Freud noted
that, as he worked on his interpretation of Schreber's case in the late
evening hours, he experienced an almost total identification with his
subject. "I am Schreber, nothing but Schreber," he wrote to Ferenczi.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Earlier in the year he had described Schreber to Jung as "our dear and
 ingenious Friend" who "should have been made a professor of psychiatry
 and director of a mental hospital" (<I>F/J,</I> 368, 311).

<P>
Working through the Schreber case, Freud claimed, revived the
whole complex of issues which had come to a head in his break with
Fliess. Moreover his current difficulties with his ambivalent intellectual
sons, most notably the rebellious Alfred Adler and Wilhelm Stekel,
but also the apparently loyal Ferenczi and Jung, were seen by Freud as
repeating the tensions of the Fliess relationship. In psychopathological
terms Schreber's illness was a paranoia, a form of psychosis in which
normal psychoanalytic interaction between patient and therapist was
impossible, due to the patient's unconquerable resistance to free
association and transference. Paranoiacs, Freud urged, only revealed
what they wanted to reveal, remaining enclosed within their own private
worlds. To reconstruct the story of a paranoiac thus required an empathic
reconstruction of his world. Like a voice from a foreign culture, the
voice of the psychotic could only be construed from an understanding
of his own language. During the period when Freud was unraveling what
he saw as the riddle of Schreber's world he also referred to Fliess and
Adler as paranoiacs, as individuals who had constructed closed systems
of meaning for themselves which were not open to critical analysis or
communicative interaction. His own task was to show that he could grasp
the conditions of this paranoid stance, that he could write the story of
the paranoiac's story in a way that revealed the particular conditions
of its construction.

<P>
The starting point, the originating "core" (<I>Kern)</I> of Schreber's
pathological paranoia, Freud claimed, was a "feminine (passive homosexual)
wish fantasy" that could be traced to the "familiar" or commonly shared
father-complex and castration-complex of the oedipal constellation ("PB,"
180; "PN," 55). Schreber's story renacted the unconscious infantile wish
to be the love object of the revered and feared father, to be the mother
to the father. But the fulfillment of this wish implied an unmanning or
emasculation articulated as the threat and fear of castration. At stake
in the return of the infantile wish and its imagined consequences was the
adult male ego's masculine identity. A resurgence and reexperiencing of
the conflicting emotions of this infantile complex, Freud noted, was not
uncommon among middle-aged men (in their early fifties, like himself) in
whom the decline of heterosexual virility that characterized the male
version of menopause often produced a resurgence of homosexual libido
("PB," 171-2; "PN," 45-6). In severe cases of unmasterable homosexual
impulses, this crisis of sexual identity produced a regression to the
stage of libidinal development in which the process of ego-formation was
in its embryonic stages, the stage of childhood narcissism in which the
scattered libidinal urges of the autoerotic



<B></B>



stage were first integrated into a love of one's own embodied self, before
being directed toward external objects, and thus before a recognition
of the boundaries which defined the ego in relation to the world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In Freud's story of Schreber's story, therefore, the beginnings of
 paranoia lay in a response to the threat of the collapse of masculine
 identity through a virtual dissolution of the bounded ego and a
 return to the moment prior to the differentiation of ego and external
 world. Schreber's crisis moved from the fantasy of being transformed
 into a woman to the catastrophic collapse of the distinction between
 self and world, and a return to the archaic, primal moment of self and
 world not yet differentiated. The familiar symptomology of paranoid
 delusion could be understood from the inside (from the "native's point
 of view," we might say) as a defensive response to this experience
 of threat and dissolution, whence regression to the self-sufficiency
 and megalomania of the narcissistic stage. The specific originating
 cause of paranoid psychopathology was a traumatizing disavowal of the
 homosexual fantasy-wish of becoming a feminine love-object of masculine
 desire. The defensive measures produced against this unconscious wish,
 however, were shaped by the particular stage of libidinal and ego
 development, infantile narcissism, within which they were originally
 constructed. The delusional world that the paranoid created was an
 alternative to the real world, a self-contained domain of imaginary
 (aesthetic?) objects that could be easily manipulated, a space in which
 the wish for feminization could be artificially or symbolically mastered
 and thus given coherence and meaning.

<P>
As recounted by Freud, Schreber's construction of a delusional solution
to the collapse of his masculine identity actually has two distinct
elements. At the most obvious paranoiac level, Schreber transforms
the threat from within (the fantasy of becoming a woman) into a threat
from without--the paranoid belief that he is the victim of a process of
unmanning by external powers. Eventually Schreber finds a satisfactory
meaning for this victimization. He transforms his humiliation and
hostility into at least partial honor and acceptance by identifying
his persecutor and castrator as God, by providing a cosmic theological
framework and thus higher meaning and purpose for his suffering. However,
in extreme psychotic forms of paranoiac delusion, which involve the
collapse of the external world and regression to infantile narcissism, a
further transformation is accomplished, one that recreates the suffering
victim as a messianic savior. The transformation into a woman who
can only find her identity as the love-object of a man is restaged as
identification with the mother, the primal origin of being who attracts
to herself all of the rays of divine libido and gives birth to a new race
of men and a new world. For Freud, the story of Schreber exemplifies
two interrelated forms of delusional defensive formation against the
threat to masculine autonomy: the story of the victim who defines himself
as the object of the male ego, and the story of messianic election in
which the dissolution of the individual ego becomes the condition for
a megalomaniac and apocalyptic fantasy, one in which a new world and a
new self are created out of the collapse into nothing. Both stories for
Freud are signs of failure--exemples of constructing identities that
ignore the real conditions of human finitude and the onerous tasks of
achieved autonomy and



<B></B>



identity. Demystification of these stories opens up the possibility
for a recreation of the struggle for self-mastery and autonomy as an
interminable labor of self construction, labor that must take place
in the context of a disabused knowledge of the limiting conditions of
biological and historical fate.

<P>
Freud's view of the Schreber story was a moral tale that allowed him
to reconstruct the story of his own identity as <I>not</I> paranoid and
<I>not</I> delusional. By working through and understanding the conditions
of such a response to the threat of feminization as emasculation, Freud
insisted, he had "succeeded where the paranoiac fails." By working through
the homosexual investment in his relationship to Fliess, he had succeeded
in utilizing and controlling his femininity for the enhancement of his
autonomy, for the "enlargement" of his ego.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Yet in the concluding paragraphs of his retelling of Schreber's
 story he wondered, in an ironical but telling fashion, whether his
 own self-conscious reconstruction of Schreber's narrative might not
 be as much a fictional and delusional construct as Schreber's. Was the
 explanatory history of desire into which he had incorporated Schreber's
 world-construction anything more than another delusional system, parallel
 to Schreber's own, and thus a parallel defense against his own fears
 of feminization?:

Schreber's "rays of God" which are made up of a condensation of the
sun's rays, of nerve fibres and of spermatazoa, are in reality nothing
else than a concrete representation and external projection of libidinal
cathexes <I>(Besetzungen); </I>and thus lend his delusions a striking
similarity with our theory. His belief that the world must come to an
end because his ego was attracting all the rays to itself, his anxious
concern at a later period, during the process of reconstruction, lest
God should sever his ray connection with him
--these and many other details of Schreber's delusional formation sound
almost like endopsychic perceptions of the processes whose existence I

I had developed my theory of paranoia before I became acquainted with
the contents of Schreber's book, It remains for the future to decide
whether there is more delusion in my theory than I like to admit, or
whether there is more truth in Schreber's delusion than other people
are as yet prepared to believe. ["PB," 199-200; "PN," 78-9]

<P>
Freud recognized that Schreber's delusional creation of a private
mythology and cosmology, in which gender identity was constructed and
provided with meaning by the framing theory of the operation of divine
invisible rays operating through nerves, sperm, and blood, was itself
a kind of inadvertent parody of his own psychoanalytical framing of
the process of gender differentiation through the transformations of
libido. For a number of years he and Jung exchanged "Schreberisms,"
phrases derived from the private language Schreber had constructed to
describe his delusional cosmos, in their private correspondence. This
jargon humorously paralleled their use of the psychoanalytical jargon
which had been created to gain a theoretical distance from, a scientific
control of, similar processes of gender differentiation and identity
construction.

<P>
Recent commentaries on Freud's retelling of the Schreber story indicate
that Freud's work, rather than translating delusions into controlled
conceptual structures,



<B></B>



may have offered something that more nearly resembles a competing fiction
or myth about the processes of masculine identification. In his reading
of Schreber, Freud chose to omit two elements that played a key role in
Schreber's account. First, Schreber's "theory" had clearly paralleled
Weininger's in drawing analogies between feminization and transformation
into the eternal Jew. But Freud, anxious to avoid the accusation that
psychoanalytic theory was less a universal science than a representation
of the conflicts of a specifically Jewish experience (especially now,
when he was grooming Jung as his Gentile crown prince), narrowed his
focus exclusively to the masculinity complex in the text. Second,
Schreber's self-constructed messianic myth clearly transformed the
negative definition of feminization as emasculation (threatening the
collapse of masculine "being") into a positive identification with woman
as mother and creator of being.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 For him, the transformation into a woman was interpreted as a gain
 rather than a loss. His unmanning was less a loss of being, more the
 assumption of a new form of being as the primal creative source of
 both masculine and feminine beings. Schreber's identification with the
 "feminine" was thus ambivalent: it was not just a taking of the passive
 feminine position vis-&agrave;-vis masculine agency, but a merging with
 the maternal, originating ground of a world divided by subject/object,
 passive/active distinctions. These critical elements in stories of
 the refashioning of masculine identity were not ignored in the more
 self-consciously fictional stories of masculine identity formation
 produced by Freud's Austrian contemporaries, Arthur Schnitzler and
 Robert Musil. Both Schnitzler and Musil were trained as scientists,
 specifically scientific psychologists; Schnitzler as a medical doctor
 and psychiatrist in the Vienna Medical School, Musil as an engineer
 and physicist in the Machian tradition. Unlike Freud, however, they
 eventually decided that it was fictional narrative and the metaphoric
 language of art, rather than the analytical case study and the
 conceptual language of science, which could best portray the kind of
 self-reflexive narrative of identity construction that Freud described
 as the distinctive achievement of psychoanalytic science. Inverting
 the hierarchical distinctions Freud had constructed between art and
 science in "Dora," they judged the perspective of science as confined
 to the limiting one-dimensionality of surface phenomena and prone to a
 conceptual dogmatism (and thus to a recapitulation self-alienating myth )
 which crudely fixated the fluid dynamics of lived experience. They turned
 to experimental, aesthetic, fictional construction as the appropriate
 form for unveiling the multi-dimensionality of conscious and unconscious
 mental life, of psychic event and psychic structure, of memory and the
 present, in stories of self-dissolution and self-formation.

<P>
Parallels in the cultural perspectives and the generational, ethnic,
social, professional, and educational experiences of Freud and Schnitzler
have often been noted, as have the mutual recognition and admiration
which prompted Freud to describe



<B></B>



Schnitzler as his double (<I>Doppelg&auml;nger</I>), and Schnitzler to
remark on the way he found himself attracted by Freud's "total being"
(<I>gesamtes Wesen</I>) and perceived himself psychologically as Freud's
"psychological twin brother."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 This acknowledged closeness, however, was matched by a mutual distancing
 and a marked attempt to avoid close social contact. Just as Freud
 separated his own work from the construction of narrative meaning by
 the fictional story teller in "Dora," so Schnitzler distanced himself
 from what he saw as the overly deterministic, schematic theorizing in
 much psychoanalytic writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Both saw a tendency toward self-deceptive closure and evasion
 of self-conscious reflectivity in the work of the other. Yet the
 parallelism in such mutual critique, often directed more vaguely at a
 category and genre (the psychoanalyst, the writer or <I>Dichter</I>)
 than at the person, only seems to make the reputed closeness between
 Freud and Schnitzler more compelling.

<P>
Although Schnitzler's literary reputation in the early twentieth
century was built on his short stories and dramas, the full-length
novel he published in 1908, <I>The Road into the Open</I> (<I>Der Weg
ins Freie),</I> was considered by Schnitzler himself as the culminating
work of his literary career up to that moment. In early 1906, two years
before the novel's completion, he imagined it as a representative epic
of his age, a work that would take its place in the line of great German
novels from <I>Wilhelm Meister</I> to <I>Buddenbrooks.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 His emotional identifications with his characters and his involvement
 in the depicted situations often became so intense that he experienced
 great difficulty separating his own existence from his work. Reading
 parts of it in progress to his wife, he found himself choking back
 his tears, and when he was finished he noted not only his pride in
 accomplishment, but also his yearning to "return" to the novel, as if
 it was his only satisfactory home in a homeless world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 This identification with his subject, as in Freud's case studies,
 emerged from the attempt to work through and master his own
 experience. Schnitzler's autobiography and recently published diaries
 reveal remarkable personal analogies between the central plot of the
 novel and his own affair with Marie Reinhard in 1895-1897.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The writing of the novel worked, again like Freud's case studies, as
 a process of both therapeutic self-understanding and self-construction.

<P>
Schnitzler's contemporaries, including close friends and admirers, like
Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Georg Brandes, often appeared less impressed
than Schnitzler by the alleged exemplary qualities of the novel, tending
to interpret the psychological, social, and philosophical or theoretical
dimensions of the novel as not fully integrated, as constituting separable
stories which should have remained separate. Schnitzler however, insisted
that the connection between the three dimensions was precisely the
impetus behind his work. Although <I>The Road into the Open</I> may
not be the great modern German, Austrian, or even Viennese novel that
Schnitzler had hoped it would be, it does provide an insight into the
inner connections between becoming a man, finding a home, and being an
artist in Schnitzler's particular version of early Viennese modernism.

<P>
The theme or problem of fashioning masculine identity is the most obvious
and dominant of the centers around which are constructed the consciousness
and existence



<B></B>



 of the novel's protagonist, the aristocratic, Gentile composer
 Baron Georg von Wergenthin; his alter ego, the middle-class Jewish
 writer Heinrich Bermann; and their overlapping circles of friends and
 acquaintances. Developed as a cyclically arranged series of moments
 in the narrative of one year of Wergenthin's life, the novel begins
 shortly after the death of his father and ends shortly after the death
 of his (illegitimate) son in childbirth. Fatherhood and a version of the
 father complex are clearly at the center of Schnitzler's conception of
 the narrative of masculine self-making, and the discovery of the path
 to masculine autonomy (one of the possible meanings of the novel's
 title). Virtually every male character is first introduced through a
 description of the father/son relationship. The generational formation of
 masculine identity, the passing on of the powers and duties of fatherhood
 is at issue. Examined through the lens of fatherhood, masculine autonomy
 is tied to the assumption of responsible freedom, the establishment of a
 character held in place by obligations and commitments as a reliable and
 stable center of order in time and space. Emancipation in this context
 means on the one hand emancipation from the determinations of unmastered
 desires, from passive surrender of the will to circumstance and the pull
 of the object of desire, and on the other hand, emancipation from the
 cul-de-sac of cynical, isolating egoism, in which self-consciousness of
 the constructed nature of personal identities leads only to directionless
 drift, to an inability to act out a program for the creation of any
 substantial identity.

<P>
In the opening scene, as Wergenthin muses about his recently deceased
father, a memory drifts into his consciousness. A few months before his
father's death, he had been involved in a non-committal, self-indulgent
love affair with an emancipated American woman (Grace) traveling in
Italy. Trying to give aesthetic form to the emotional impressions of
this love, he had composed an adagio, swelling with harmonic richness,
but ultimately unable to sustain itself for any length due to a lack
of systematic structure and clear over-arching melodic narrative. His
father had noted this failure of order and direction with a telling
question posed as Georg's improvisations on the piano drifted toward
aimless dissipation: "Where to? Where to?" (<I>Wohin?</I> <I>Wohin?</I>)
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 The inability to impose a satisfactory order on his experience, to
 make a commitment to a specific woman as the stable object shaping his
 sexual desire, to assume a tradition as his own past and to construct
 a program which would present beginnings and goals, pasts and future
 in clear narrative outline, the inability to take responsibility for
 the consequences of his actions and the effect of his self-defined
 personhood, define Georg's drift in a world where every definition and
 commitment appears open to constant renegotiation and only the moment
 and its immediate emotional content has recognizable value. Autonomy
 of the kind demanded by the father required a self-definition and
 substantial set of stable commitments which contradicted the open road
 of anchorless drift which Wergenthin would like to accept as his fate
 and the open road of infinite possibilities that he would like to avow
 as his chosen destiny.

<P>
In the novel, fathers represent the claims of independence achieved
through disciplined responsibility, sustained work, and self-defined
social obligation.



<B></B>



Wergenthin constantly finds himself counseled to take responsibility
for the social and moral consequences of his actions, to both affirm
his subjective agency and recognize that his autonomy is regulated and
affirmed under moral rules and social conventions. A series of fathers
and father res take on the position of enforcing the general law
of the father, and thus intrude a voice of conscience and a reminder of
transgression and guilt.

<P>
Wergenthin's inability to make himself into an adult person, a mature
man according to the moral ideal of his real and symbolic fathers, is
expressed in the vague guilt that always accompanies the recognition
of his transgressions (despite all rationalizations about generational
differences, historical change and relative cultural values), and the
insistent, repetitious assertiveness of a recent memory trace--the
self-indulgent love affair with Grace whose end was also marked by the
unexplained suicide of a young painter (Labinski) who had been traveling
with them in Italy. While the memory of Grace keeps reappearing as an
emotional sign of Wergenthin's faithless, self-indulgent, egoistic use
of women as provisional objects of momentary desire, Labinski returns
like a ghostly conscience revealing the dark underside (of transgression,
disavowed guilt, punishment and death) within his anchorless existence. In
a dream near the end of the book, Labinski emerges as the helmsman
of Georg's ship of life, the re of death and guilt who steers his
rudder. The persistent reappearance of Grace and Labinski in Wergenthin's
memories, fantasies, and dreams also reminds the reader that his current
affair is a repetitive acting out of an unmastered past which continues
to frame Wergenthin's intra-psychic relations in the present. His freedom
emerges as a repetitively enacted fate.

<P>
The failure of Wergenthin to achieve the kind of masculine identity
designated by the personal autonomy and social responsibilities of
fatherhood is most dramatically articulated in his relationship to the
child whose inception and birth mark the boundaries of the novel's
temporal narrative. Wergenthin is unable to commit himself to his
offspring, to remember his part in its creation, to prepare or even
imagine a home for its arrival, and it's death in childbirth is at
least partly recognized as an expression of these failures. The son,
Wergenthin allows himself to muse, refused to enter into a world where
it would not be loved and sustained, where it could not hope to find a
home (<I>WIF,</I> 956; <I>RIO,</I> 295). Wergenthin's transgression and
failure as a man lies in his unwillingness to work through his dependent
sonship and to assume fatherhood, to take responsibility for the future,
to define his identity in a way which would provide a moral framework
for the reproduction of future generations.

<P>
Schnitzler situates the father/son thematic in Wergenthin's self-formation
within a spectrum of analogous pairings in which similar tensions are
played out in slightly different ways. Wergenthin's alter ego, Heinrich
Bermann, suffers most dramatically under the burden of guilt and the
consciousness of having betrayed his father's claims on him. Bermann's
father is a former liberal lawyer and patriotic nationalist politician
who suffered mental and physical collapse under the pressure of the
crushing, disillusioning failure of all of his public hopes. His fall
into incurable psychosis occurs at the same time as Wergenthin's father's
death and he dies near the end of



<B></B>



the novel. Bermann projects his own creative work as a monument
to his father's dreams and ideals, but cannot go beyond imagining
this monument as a tragicomedy which parodies his father's hopes as
empty delusions, and which thus actually repudiates and kills him once
again, adding to his sense of guilt. In the more peripheral father/son
relationships of the Ehrenbergs, the Staubers, the Rosners, and the
Eisslers, the sons range in their responses from violent repudiation to
a resigned recognition of their failure to live up to paternal models
and paternal claims. But the fathers in Schnitzler's novel are not
simple representatives of a former world in which social conventions
and roles affirmed secure gender identities and public callings: they
already carry the seeds of their son's dilemmas within their own lives
and careers. All are marked by disappointments in the public sphere which
encourage withdrawal to scientific work, aesthetic enjoyment, domestic
relations, or even dreams of exile and new beginnings. The dilemmas
of the sons as the elder Dr. Stauber suggests, are only quantitatively
rather than qualitatively distinct from the conflicts which the older
generation had experienced. Historical change may have made the tasks
of achieving autonomous manhood more difficult, its conflicts more
extreme, but it cannot absolve the younger generation of the ethical
demand to achieve a responsible freedom within the conditions in which
they have been thrown by fate. The crises of sonship and fatherhood with
which Wergenthin is surrounded are more extreme than his own, both in
their repudiations and in their guilt-ridden anxieties, but they mirror
back to him in revealing (though often disavowed) forms the patterns of
transgression and guilt in his own consciousness and behavior. Only a
few sons (all minor characters), like Wergenthin's brother Felician, who
tends to assume his adult responsibilities almost as a natural role, or
the social radical Leo Golowski, who experiments with future identities
by simply ignoring a father who has descended into hopeless impotence,
attain even a semblance of resolution. But even they are marked by the
general tendency toward escape into ideological utopia, travel or art.

<P>
The achievement of masculine identity as an assumption of the role of the
father is tied to the disciplining and sublimating of sexual desire in
complex ways. In Schnitzler's account of Wergenthin's struggle with his
masculinity, the femininity in relation to which his masculinity jockies
for definition is tied to the image and role of motherhood. Wergenthin's
principle feminine other in the novel, his lover Anna Rosner, who bears
his child, emerges as a potential maternal feminine re that could mold
his desire toward a responsible, paternal masculinity. From the beginning
he experiences her not only as an object of sexual pleasure but as the
psychosexual guide that might help him attain a secure consciousness
of self within a stable sense of home; a woman who was "better suited
than anyone else to counteract his tendency toward frivolousness and
carelessness and to spur him on to purposeful and productive activities"
(<I>WIF,</I> 53; <I>RIO,</I> 44).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 It is precisely her much noted tendency to peaceful self-containment and
 bourgeois domesticity which first attracts him and then occasionally
 repels him as a restriction on his freedom of self-expression. Her
 gentle reproaches act in combination with paternal admonitions to impose
 a feeling



<B></B>



of guilt for his failure to take responsibility for his own personal
actions and social roles. During a long vacation trip to Italy during the
late months of Anna's pregnancy, Wergenthin visits the site in Florence
where he had watched his mother die when he was a young boy. As he tries
to recreate the earlier bedside scene in his memory he suddenly realizes
to his amazement that the word "mother" no longer meant "the long buried
woman who had born him; the word meant that other woman who was not a
mother yet, but who would be in a few months . . . the mother of the
child of whom he was the father. And now the word suddenly sounded as
though it intoned something never heard before, never understood, as
if accompanied by mysteriously singing bells in the distant future"
(<I>WIF,</I> 166; <I>RIO,</I> 148).
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P>
But the image of the mother also operates in a rather different way in
Wergenthin's psychosexual life. It serves as an image of transgressive,
irresponsible sexuality, of dangerous surrender to unfettered desire. Just
weeks before the birth of Anna's child, Wergenthin indulges in a
wild, reckless affair with a married woman. This mystery woman also
treats him like a mother, resting her hands on his head as he puts his
head in her lap, and listening to and accepting his confessions without
censure. However, she is also a maternal re "created for every madness
and ecstasy . . . the dark gaze of her eyes, the blue-black stream of
her undone hair, the smell of her pale and naked body" (<I>WIF,</I> 236;
<I>RIO,</I> 211).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Wergenthin's passion also fills him with at least momentary
 self-confidence and a sense of power fueled by the vague forces of
 unconscious energies. Yet he returns to Anna and, crying in apparent
 contrition, lays his head in her lap, an experience that "seemed to him
 like a vague and sweet dream, as if he lay as a boy at the feet of his
 mother, and this moment was already a memory, remote and painful, as
 he was experiencing it" (<I>WIF,</I> 240; <I>RIO,</I> 215).
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P>
Wergenthin's struggle to define his masculinity in relation to this
ambivalent maternal femininity is not offset by a correspondingly serious
encounter with the femininity of emancipated younger, non-maternal
women. His flirtations in these directions all lead to problematic and
unsatisfactory relations with persons who are caught in the same complex
problems of self-definition that he is experiencing. In its extreme
form, the fate of masculinity in relation to this new, emancipated woman
is represented by the tragic relations between Bermann and an unnamed
actress who eventually chooses to take her life rather than continue to
play the battle of identity as a battle of power and submission between
the sexes. This woman is constantly forced to submit to the identities
imposed upon her, to exist only as a projection of Bermann's fear of
feminization. Although Schnitzler continually reminds the reader that
the women in the novel are themselves historical agents struggling
with problems of gender and social identity that parallel those of the
male protagonists, the male characters never themselves appropriate this
understanding and continue to relate to individual women in terms of their
own psychological needs and projections. Like Anna, the emancipated young
Jewish women--Else Ehrenburg, Sissy Wyner, Therese Golowski--all find
themselves placed in positions in which it seems virtually impossible
to avoid eventual resignation to the roles and types constructed for
them by men. Neither Wergenthin nor Bermann are able to define their
own masculinity



<B></B>



 in relation to the feminine as anything but an other that must
 be possessed. Just as Bermann refuses to recognize his lover as a
 responsible agent in her own right, and not just an affirmation of, or
 threat to, his own identity, so Wergenthin only finds satisfaction with
 Anna when he can experience her as a refuge in which his wandering
 finally finds a home after a long journey, as "the only being who
 completely belonged to him" (<I>zu dem einzigen Wesen, das ihm ganz
 geh&ouml;rte)</I>, and as a kind of surrogate anchor for his own absent
 center (<I>WIF,</I> 102; <I>RIO,</I> 90). Neither Wergenthin nor Berman
 seem able to perceive the women in their lives as individuals caught
 in the same conflicts as their own, as projects of identity formation
 which demand both an emancipation from maternal attachments and paternal
 domination and a free reshaping of the relations between feminine and
 masculine in their adult identities.

<P>
The narrative of masculine self-formation in <I>The Road into the Open</I>
does not produce any clear resolution for the major characters. At
the novel's end, as Wergenthin abandons Anna to take on a temporary
position as a conductor's assistant in a provincial German town, he is
right back where he had begun a year earlier. He seeks the illusion of
a freedom defined by mobility and lack of commitment and escape from
the self-definition and responsibilities of fatherhood. The death
of Bermann's lover leaves him as bound to the bitter resentments of
being determined in his actions by the identities thrust upon him, and
stymied by his inability to forge relations of trust and intimacy, as
he had been at the beginning of the novel. But in the telling of this
unresolved cyclical story Schnitzler also told a story of its cultural
and social contexts, of the conditions which made the ambivalences and
apparent failures of his characters understandable.

<P>
The social dimension of <I>The Road into the Open</I> has often been
perceived as disjointed from the love plot because it seems so completely
focused on questions of Jewish identity, a problem which apparently
did not directly affect the non-Jewish principals, Georg von Wergenthin
and Anna Rosner. Yet it seems clear that Schnitzler situated his story
of personal identity adrift within the context of a world of Austrian
Jews in a crisis of cultural assimilation, acculturation and exclusion
because he perceived the particular issues of anti-Semitism and Jewish
self-identification as exemplary of a larger cultural process. This
process determined, even if in less extreme and self-conscious form,
the individual lives and the cultural worlds of Wergenthin and Anna as
well. Throughout the novel it is clear that the oscillating attraction
and repulsion that Wergenthin and Anna experience in their relations to
their Jewish friends and acquaintances is indicative of the larger meaning
that Schnitzler ascribes to Jewish experience and self-consciousness. The
Jewish crisis is both exemplary of a general cultural crisis and an
extreme form of that crisis. It can thus serve as an ideal-typical form
that clarifies and articulates the determining structures and essential
components of the larger cultural world. The particular experience of
the dilemmas of Jewish emancipation and cultural identification forces
an articulation and thinking through of a general cultural crisis of
subjective autonomy and communal identity. In the novel it is the Jews who
theorize, politically and philosophically, the meaning of fatherlessness
and homelessness, the breakdown of



<B></B>



responsible paternal masculinity, the inability to produce oneself
objectively in art or society as a solid, essential identity, and
the ambivalence of "freedom" in a world without anchors where all are
strangers within their own homeland.

<P>
At the center of this story of the universalization of Jewishness is the
friendship between Wergenthin and Bermann. From the beginning Wergenthin
is drawn toward Bermann in part because of a curiosity about the alien
and exotic, a desire to "peer into a world that until now had remained
foreign to him" (<I>in eine Welt hineinzuschauen, die ihm bisher ziemlich
fremd geblieben war</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 80; <I>RIO,</I> 148]). Similarly
Bermann seems drawn to Wergenthin in part because he views him as somehow
immune from the torturous conflicts of his own self-consciousness as a
Jew. Attraction is mixed on both sides with distancing and occasional
resentment at either the perceived smugness or hypersensitivity of the
other. But Wergenthin does have moments in which he also recognizes
himself in the other and envisions the tortured souls of Bermann and
his other Jewish acquaintances as the cultural site on which "the future
of humanity was preparing itself" (<I>in deren Seelen sich die Zukunft
der Menschheit vorbereitete</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 94; <I>RIO,</I> 82]). The
elective affinity and disaffinity between Wergenthin and Bermann is
given specific objectification in their attempted collaboration on an
opera in which Wergenthin was to provide the music to Bermann's story of
a hero/son who ultimately shatters in his attempt to take the father's
place, to possess the primal object of desire and to inherit the Kingdom,
because of his inability to work through the guilt embedded in his
fate and unwillingness to construct a life in the context of the death
which awaits him. Although Wergenthin and Bermann are both obsessively
absorbed with the son's situation, neither can imagine a completion or
Third Act for their story, just as their own mutual sympathies never find
a satisfactory resolution in a stable, intimate, and loyal friendship.

<P>
The relationship between Wergenthin and Bermann as a relationship
between insider and outsider, German and Jew, is mirrored from various
perspectives in the personal relationships which surround them. Schnitzler
follows up many possible ways in which Jewish experiments in identity
formation could work as mirrors for a more universal understanding. Anna
Rosner, for example, finds herself attracted to two Jewish suitors (prior
to the affair with Wergenthin) who appeal to her not only because of
their understanding of the problems of constructing a home and a temporal
identity (in generational continuity with parents and children) in a
world in which such homes and identities are no longer simply natural,
but also because the choices they make from within this understanding
recognize the need to discipline the autonomy of self-choice with social
responsibilities. Although completely apolitical herself, she is drawn
to men who define freedom as freedom in solidarity with others, and
take up public careers as political leaders. While Wergenthin often
runs away from the problematic self-consciousness of relations with
Bermann and other Jews to the apparently unproblematic home of Anna's
love and acceptance, Anna herself finds protection and consolation from
Wergenthin's self-indulgent freedom in the support of Jews who recognize
her unjust fate more readily than he does. In fact there is a sense in
which Schnitzler does portray a kind of inner sympathy between



<B></B>



women and Jews. Both are engaged in a battle for self-definition within
a situation in which they can never escape the identities that have
been thrust upon them by dominant masculine and/or Christian-German
perspectives. Although both Bermann and Stauber have moments in which
they assert their commitment to a Nietzschean ideology of self-sufficient
self-making, their brave words seem like a spitting into the wind. And
the women eventually end their brief experiments in self-making with
resigned submission to conventional feminine identities.

<P>
Schnitzler constructs his fictional world in such a way that the
Gentile and Jewish positions are not presented as binaries, as closure
and openness, rootedness and homelessness, etc., but as distorting
and illuminating mirrors of each other. Temporal discontinuity
and cultural exile envelops the whole society in which the Jews
are situated. Wergenthin himself, although a member of a family
in the service nobility whose aristocratic credentials reach back
four generations, emerges from a rootless "hotel and wandering life"
(<I>Hotel</I> <I>und</I> <I>Wandersleben</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 9; <I>RIO,</I>
5]) as a child to a recognition that "he had no intimate relationship
to any human being" despite his many acquaintances (<I>da&szlig; er zu
keinem menschlichen Wesen in engerer Beziehung stand</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 12;
<I>RIO,</I> 8]). His homelessness does not carry the intense feelings of
exclusion and involuntary identification experienced by the Jews--he
wears his clothes with apparent elegant ease and can fit in less
self-consciously than Bermann who is always somewhat embarrassingly
overdressed or underdressed. But Schnitzler does suggest that appearing
awkward and out of place in public is not a problem confined to
Jews--as indicated by the descriptions of Anna's brother's attempt to
somehow fit in with the Christian nationalist Right. In the dream which
Schnitzler uses to portray the conflicts within Wergenthin's psyche,
moreover, Wergenthin does appear to himself in the "Jewish" position
of being awkwardly underdressed in a formal social gathering. Even
among exemplars of a traditional privileged class whose public carriage
and sense of self seem most natural--like Felician Wergenthin, or the
Hungarian noble Demeter Stanzides--there are moments of social unease
and cultural alienation which make participation in the Jewish social
circles, exile, or a "hotel and wandering life" seem almost natural for
them as well. As outsiders within, as foreigners in their own country,
as experiments in self-construction whose emancipation has left them
bereft of all natural identities, the Jews articulate the fate of
the human. The illusory vision of a Palestinian fatherland parallels
the delusions of German nationalists, anti-Semites and socialists, in
which the split within the self experienced by all was projected into a
division between a homogeneous "us" and an external "them." The problem
of defining a homeland which would be neither an ancestral fatherland nor
an emotionally exclusive motherland, but a space for the development of
responsible freedom within the acceptance of realistic social obligation,
was common to all, men and women, Germans and Jews.

<P>
Art's task for Schnitzler was to provide concrete shape or
objectification, and thus ultimately self-conscious appropriation and
understanding, of this human condition of identity dissolution and
recreation. Wergenthin the musical composer and



<B></B>



Bermann the writer (<I>Dichter)</I> are artists who articulate
two critical dimensions of this task. Wergenthin's art lives from
the experience of the moment, expressing the experiential, only
partly conscious movement of desire freed from conventional social
discipline. His peak experiences emerge from moments of surrender to
a primordial, maternal sensuality in which conventional identities
dissolve and he feels himself as pure potentiality. His characteristic
compositions express rather than conquer the undisciplined drift of
desire. He is most successful in the genres of the romantic song and
in brief, usually improvised, fantasias or tone poems for piano. Even
in these genres, however, he is unable to "finish," to round off his
creations as completed compositions with an internal structure. Even
his most successful songs, Anna notes, tend to "drift" off at the end
(<I>verl&auml;uft es</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 34; <I>RIO,</I> 27]). The quintet
which represents his goal of accomplishing a fully formed and structured
work goes nowhere during the course of the novel and becomes a sign
of his failed promise, his incorrigible dilettantism, his inability to
sustain the kind of disciplined work which would marks the achievement
of an adult identity.

<P>
Wergenthin becomes self-confidently buoyant with creativity during the
moods in which his unconscious feelings suddenly rise to the surface
and find brief musical expression. During such moments Wergenthin feels
inspired by a mysterious inner necessity, something "incomprehensible"
which he simply needed to allow to "go its own way" and he dreams of
future projects and endless possibilities (<I>als m&uuml;&szlig;te er nur
ein Unbegreifliches ge&auml;hren lassen</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 56; <I>RIO,</I>
47]). When Wergenthin allows his daydreams, memories, and half-understood
desires free reign, he feels fully alive and is ready to turn back the
persistent echoes of the paternal conscience which demand that he find
a clear direction for his work, complete a fully formed composition,
and fulfill his youthful potential.

<P>
Bermann seems acutely aware of Wergenthin's strengths and weaknesses
as an artist. He recognizes with some envy that in his inspired moments
Wergenthin can live in an atmosphere of aesthetic perception and feeling
which does not demand the sense of creative accomplishment that comes
from a fully articulated work. Bermann himself cannot give himself over
to his feelings and moods; he is unable to allow himself the sense of
uncontrolled drift and surrender to memories, moods and images in which
Wergenthin indulges. Bermann's aesthetic tool is the word, his method,
incessant analysis. Everything must be articulated in consciousness,
brought to full understanding. His own self-confidence comes from the
conviction that he is "able to see into the human soul . . . deep inside,
in everyone, honest or dishonest, men, women or children, heathens,
Jews, Protestants, even Catholics, nobles and Germans" (<I>WIF,</I> 42;
<I>RIO,</I> 34).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The defensive and mistrustful position of the cultural outsider is for
 Bermann a position of superiority. But like Wergenthin's surrender to
 the unconscious, Bermann's confident analytic self-understanding also
 produces aesthetic failure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 While Wergenthin can never find a systematic or teleological structure
 which will fully articulate his deeper feelings, Bermann finds that his
 words can never join together into a satisfying and coherent aesthetic
 whole. His creative conceptions dissolve into sentences, words, and
 finally isolated "letters on white paper" as if "a



<B></B>



death's hand had touched it all" (<I>Nein, Buchstaben auf weisem Papier
. . wie wenn eine Totenhand alles ber&uuml;hrt hatte</I> [<I>WIF,</I>
50; <I>RIO, </I>41]). When he tries to imagine a structure emerging
from his method of analytical, self-conscious dissection he envisions
a wildly spinning carousel moving upward to the top of a tower before
plunging into the abyss (<I>WIF,</I> 48-9, 261, 330; <I>RIO,</I> 40, 235,
296). Understanding does not produce a new meaning or create satisfactory
self-conscious identities, but either dissolves everything or, in resigned
irony and cynicism, leaves everything as it is. Even if all the lights
on the various stories of the inner life were turned on, and the soul
completely illuminated, Bermann laments, the self would remain a "mess,"
without coherence or continuity (<I>sieht's n&auml;mlich greulich aus</I>
[<I>WIF,</I> 330; <I>RIO,</I> 296]). Ironically it is precisely Bermann's
self-conscious, critical, diagnostic, analytical obsessiveness which
makes others dismiss his work as that of an outsider who doesn't really
understand the actual worlds of the people he is writing about. Bermann
himself recognizes that his analysis of half-understood moods, unconscious
desires, and secret motives is not therapeutic, and that he therefore
cannot really operate as Wergenthin's therapist:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
My dear friend, understanding helps nothing. Understanding is a sport
like any other. Avery noble sport and a very expensive one.One can
squander one's whole soul on it and be left a beggar. But understanding
has nothing in the slightest to do with our feelings--almost as little
as with our actions. It won't save us from sadness, from disgust or
from annihilation. It leads to nothing. It's a blind alley, so to
speak. Understanding only means an end. [<I>WIF,</I> 214; <I>RIO,</I> 191]

<P>
At moments like these, Bermann loses his sense of superiority over
Wergenthin and wishes for a "capacity to perceive each experience as
new and individual," for the strength to "endure in each moment" as
if one stood in a "new world." The impulse to reduce all experience
to words, he suggests is just as cowardly, just as morally blind and
defensive as Wergenthin's refusal to face the full consequential logic
of his surrender to the drift of unconscious desire and to assume
self-conscious responsibility for his actions. The "diverse unity" of
"life" will only appear in its "wondrous" and "true" form if knowledge
can be turned back into feeling, the subjective aggression of analytical
understanding into a shared consciousness of participation in and with
the other (<I>WIF,</I> 262; <I>RIO,</I> 235-6).
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P>
Although Schnitzler clearly imagines Wergenthin and Bermann as two
variations on modern art, he does not condemn or promote either. His
own art lies precisely in presenting the historical situation of
their implication in each other. Wergenthin does not finally achieve
self-understanding through his relationship to Bermann. After a brief
moment in which he recognizes that the death of his child is a consequence
of his moral failure in assuming the responsibilities of freedom, he
returns to his persistent self-deceiving belief that his only true
freedom lies in breaking all social ties and floating along freely on
the sea of his moods and desires. Their collaboration on the opera falls
apart as Bermann is unable to imagine a resolution of the son's quest



<B></B>



for autonomy under the burden of his guilt, and, as Bermann loses
the thread of his story, Wergenthin's musical inspirations cease as
well. Neither is able to face the reality of the third act in which the
freedom of self-construction in an anchorless world would be directly
confronted with the moral responsibilities of selfhood and social
obligation, in which the son would have to face the consequences of
his patricidal and incestuous wishes. The revelation of Wergenthin's
inner contradictions does not find its articulate shape in a libretto or
in a critical diagnostic case study by Bermann. It emerges through the
description of a dream which he cannot fully understand but whose keys are
presented to the audience of readers by associations to the contradictory
structures of the composer's world as created by the author. It is only
within Schnitzler's fictional construction of the structure of psychic
and social relations represented by the mutual entanglement of Wergenthin
and Bermann, that the differentiated "types" of the novel are seen as
internal to the self and to the culture. Bermann and Wergenthin are not
so much alternative models from which to choose, as modelings of the
mutual implicated polarities which define the cultural space in which
stories of identity formation are lived, understood and told.

<P>
Despite the many biographical parallels which have led critics to
tie Schnitzler's own position in the novel to either that presented by
Bermann or Wergenthin, Schnitzler did not simply mirror himself in these
characters but constructed himself in their mutual relationship. He
defined his modernism as a form of self-critical creativity in
which the struggle to produce a satisfactory identity, to create a
coherent narrative and a systematic, though provisional "work" from
the disjunctions of experience became the story itself. Like Freud,
Schnitzler might well have said that by articulating the conditions of
the problem he succeeded where his patients (characters) failed. Unlike
Wergenthin and Bermann, Schnitzler did complete a systematic work
which revealed the consciousness of the modern not as a resolution
of the struggle for identity in an essential masculinity, Germanness,
Jewishness, or in aesthetic transcendence, but in the recognition of
the open-ended processes of interminable identity construction and
self-understanding. For Schnitzler the recognition of the other in
oneself was the condition of a freedom which did not involve exclusion
and repudiation.

<P>
But for both Freud and Schnitzler, this critical understanding remains
a story of the male and his masculinity, a narrative of the struggle
to achieve self-definition which occurs in the force-field between the
desire for surrender to the mother and the assumption of responsible
fatherhood. From this perspective the construction of femininity as a
free act of self-creation remains a contradiction in terms. Schnitzler
does imagine both women and Jews as engaged in exemplary struggles to
construct new and experimental historical identities, rather than discover
essential or natural ones. In order to assume the mantle of responsible
autonomy, however, they must work their way through the stereotypical,
culturally imposed identities of femininity and Jewishness that have been
thrust upon them. The struggle to redefine a masculinity which will not
so much repudiate as recognize, accept and master its own femininity,



<B></B>



 thus becomes, in a sense the true exemplary human story of identity
 formation and reformation within Schnitzler's world. It is in the story
 of masculine identity formation that reflective self-understanding can
 become a generalized cultural critique.

III. Identity dissolution, Identity confusion, and the Processes of
Masculine Self-formation: Robert Musil's <I>Young T&ouml;rless</I>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The "confusions" of the teenage protagonist of Robert Musil's novella
<I>Confusions of Young T&ouml;rless </I>(<I>Verwirrungen des Z&ouml;glings
T&ouml;rle&szlig;)</I>, published in 1906 and written at about the same
time as <I>The</I> <I>Road into the Open</I>, are most obviously and
primarily confusions of self-definition or identity. From the "carriage"
of a story of adolescent psychosexual awakening, sado-masochistic
homosexual perversion, and boarding school politics, Musil tried to
provide a survey of the "landscape" which framed the "structuring
of psychic relationships" (<I>Gestaltung von</I> <I>seelischen
Zusammenhaengen)</I> in his culture. The particular materials Musil
chose for this story, which drew heavily on his own traumatic adolescent
experiences in an Austrian military academy during the 1890s, he claimed,
were simply a "trick" (<I>eine List</I>) which made it easier for him
to highlight, isolate, and simplify essential elements of the problem
of self-formation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The narrator characterizes the core of the dilemma fueling T&ouml;rless's
 confusions and self-reflections as pertaining to "what is felt to be the
 character or soul, the outline or timbre [<I>Klangfarbe</I>] of a person,
 that is to say, that something against which thoughts, decisions and
 actions appear insignificant, contingent and interchangeable . . . this
 ultimate, immovable background . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P>
At the beginning of the novel Musil describes T&ouml;rless as having lost
this sense of a centered self, of subjective agency shaping perceptions
and action in a characteristically individual fashion. But the problem is
not that T&ouml;rless is simply without identity. Rather he experiences
himself as defined by an imposed, impersonal and increasingly alien,
oppressive identity, through which his way of being who he is seems
determined by forces beyond his control. Even in the sixteen-year-old
student, the experience of imposed identity is already fairly complex
and has at least three dimensions. There is first of all T&ouml;rless's
identity as a son defined within the "unthinking, animal-like tenderness"
(<I>mit einter . . . gedankenlosen, tierischen Z&auml;rtlichkeit</I>
[<I>VZT,</I> 10; "YT," 6]) of his parent's doting concern and the
comfortable orderliness and refined, elegant manners of the society of
middle class social elites within which the warm nest of the parental
home is situated, a society of "people whose lives moved in an orderly
way between the office and the family, as though in a transparent and
solid structure, a building all of glass and iron" (<I>Menschen, deren
Leben sich wie in ienem durchsichtigen und festen Bau von Glas and Eisen
geregelt zwischen Bureau und Familie bewegt</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 46; "YT,"
50]). Second, at the boarding school, T&ouml;rless has come under the sway
of a model of precocious, rebellious teenage masculinity purveyed by some
of his classmates and expressed in typical forms of expressive debauchery
and aggressive, though secret, hostility to the hypocritical moral



<B></B>



formulas of the "masters." Two of the senior class leaders, Beineberg
and Reiting, have become T&ouml;rless's mentors in the cultivation
of this youthful manliness. In the novel's opening scene, a parental
leave-taking at the railway station after a brief visit, T&ouml;rless's
father symbolically places his son under the protective care of these
upperclassman, surrendering to them the role of masculine role model, much
as he has surrendered T&ouml;rless more generally to the guidance of the
schoolmasters for socialization into the moral order of society. This more
general or universal discipline constructs the third, most pervasive and
oppressive of T&ouml;rless's borrowed or imposed identities. Returning
to the school after his parent's departure, T&ouml;rless places his
feet in the dusty prints of the boy in front of him with the feeling of
inexorable fate, of a "stony compulsion that captured his whole life and
compressed it into this movement--step by step--along this one line, along
this narrow band drawn out through the dust" (<I>VZT,</I> 16; "YT," 13).
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P>
Tensions among these imposed and passively absorbed identities provide
the first openings for T&ouml;rless's experience of the absence or loss
of that individualizing soul which might give shape to his personal
character. The move from home to school had resulted in a brief but
intense bout of homesickness in which feelings of abandonment, grief
and inner longing, feelings which expanded far beyond any attachment for
his parents or his actual parental home and became a treasured object in
themselves, emerged as the first revelation of a distinctive and personal
inner life. During his first years at school, moreover, T&ouml;rless had
developed a close attachment to a cultural outsider, a shy and sensitive
young Prince, whose fragile individuality and religious consciousness
were so entangled in his historically anachronistic "filigree habitation"
(<I>das filigrane Geb&auml;ude)</I> of ancient custom and religious faith
that they were unable to sustain themselves against the pressures of
"the wooden yardstick of rationality" which T&ouml;rless applied to them
(<I>dieser h&ouml;lzerne Zollstab des Verstandes</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 12;
"YT," 8]).

<P>
Memories of these moments, hinting at inner depths of experience
and alternative modes of being a self, re-emerge in T&ouml;rless's
consciousness because of the unsettling powers of his emerging adolescent
sexuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 The structure of psychic relations which frame T&ouml;rless's existence
 are unveiled by the dissolving powers of sexual libido. For T&ouml;rless,
 the rough and precocious manliness of his schoolfriends does not
 provide a satisfactory shaping, control or disciplining of these
 vague, undefined feelings. Instead he is overwhelmed, as if he was
 falling through a trapdoor in the floor that held up the substantial
 and transparent relations of the everyday world defined by rational
 consciousness. While his friends display their teenage masculinity with
 lascivious comments about the peasant girls in the local village and
 in their puffed up bravado with the local prostitute, T&ouml;rless
 is overcome by fantasies of a shattering, blinding, ego-dissolving
 sensuality, by "some monstrous sight of which he could not form the
 slightest notion; something of a terrifying, beast-like sensuality;
 something that would seize him in its claws and rend him, starting with
 his eyes . . ." (<I>VZT,</I> 17-18; "YT," 15).
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 While his friends and student mentors use sexual transgression to
 prove their masculine identities and test the limits of their power
 and the boundaries



<B></B>



of their egos against the social conventions and moral rules of the adult
world, as a way of claiming their future place as holders of power in
that world, T&ouml;rless is caught in regressive fantasies which lead him
back to a primal childhood memory of total abandonment in an impersonal
world, to that moment prior to the formation of any of the subject
positions eventually imposed upon him in order to situate him within
the world. While his peers test and establish the boundaries of their
youthful selves in the world, the power of sensual urges and fantasies
exposes T&ouml;rless to the threatening and exciting experience of a
second dimension of existence. By undoing the weak, defenses provided by
his inherited identities, his libido leads him into a world of seething ,
boundary-effacing passion, of enigmatic darkness, of horizonless infinity.

<P>
Musil describes the collapse of T&ouml;rless's passively internalized
identities, the dissolution of his ego boundaries and descent into
the world of unconscious desire, in gendered terms. T&ouml;rless'
sensual passion seems relatively indifferent to the gender of its
object, sliding easily from Bozena, the village prostitute, to Basini, a
classmate. Both function as objectifications of desire more than objects
of desire. What seems important for T&ouml;rless is the identification
of the object of his lust with visions of degradation, shamelessness,
humiliation. What attracts and frightens T&ouml;rless is the experience
of falling through the trapdoor into the underworld where all the ego
boundaries of the official daytime world are dissolved. Musil tends
to describe the desire for, and identification with, the object of
desire in terms of a passive, masochistic femininity. T&ouml;rless's
hallucinations of nighttime abandonment to sensuality and absolute
loneliness appear to him as both "the temptation of a woman and of
something inhuman" (<I>sie hatte f&uuml;r ihn den Reiz eines Weibes
und einer Unmenschlichkeit)</I> and as something which he "experienced
as a woman" (<I>er f&uuml;hlte sie al eine Frau</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 25;
"YT," 24). His visits to the village prostitute are described as an
"awful rite of self-sacrifice" (<I>grausamer</I> <I>Kultus</I> <I>der
Selbstaufopferung</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 30; "YT," 31). His attraction to
Basini develops only after Basini falls into a humiliating, degrading
dependency on the sadistic whims of Beineberg and Reiting when he is
caught stealing money from a student locker. In both cases T&ouml;rless's
obsessions with "total humiliation" and shameless self-abandonment
are inextricably, but also at first inexplicably, connected to images
and memories of his mother. In his meetings with Bozena, T&ouml;rless
cannot prevent the mental associations with this woman, who for him was a
"tangle of all sexual lusts" (<I>ein Kn&auml;uel aller geschlechtlichen
Begehrlichkeiten)</I> and an exemplar of complete degradation, from
occupying the same space as images of his mother. This unconscious
association only increases his sense of the perversity of his actions,
of the transgressive dimension in his surrender to his sexual fantasies
(<I>VZT,</I> 32-3; "YT," 34). In one of the episodes with Basini, the
sudden emergence of the mother image is quickly repressed as if such
thoughts were a "sacrilege" (<I>L&auml;sterung</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 104;
"YT," 126]). Yet the holiness, the asexual purity of mothers cannot be
sustained. T&ouml;rless's fantasies and recreated memories persist in
revealing his own mother as sexual being, who has "betrayed" him with
her image of refined transparency.



<B></B>

<P>
At the same time, T&ouml;rless's desire for Basini, as his earlier
attraction to the Prince, is imagined in terms of an attraction to a
kind of prepubescent, feminine sensual beauty. Basini's facial features
are termed "effeminate" (<I>weibisch)</I>; his "soft, indolent" body
movements (<I>weiche, tr&auml;ge Bewegungen)</I> possess a "coquettish
agreeableness" (<I>eine art koketter Liebensw&uuml;rdigkeiet</I>
[<I>VZT,</I> 50; "YT," 98]); and his naked body appears to T&ouml;rless
as the "chaste slender leanness of a young girl" (<I>von einer keuschen,
schlanken Magerkeit, wie der eines jungen M&auml;dschens)</I>, a body
"lacking virtually any trace of male development" (<I>fehlte fast jede
Spur m&auml;nnlicher Formen</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 98; "YT," 119). The moment
of sensual abandonment to Basini arouses memories of T&ouml;rless's own
childhood longing to be a girl, a longing that "had tingled all over
his body and gone racing around on his skin" (<I>sie kitzelte im ganzen
K&ouml;rper und jagte rings unter der Haut umher</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 86;
"YT," 103]). For T&ouml;rless the feminine is not an image of what he
wants to overpower and possess as a masculine subject, but an image of
what he desires to be, or at least an image of a repressed and essential
part of himself to which he must surrender in order to understand what his
own individual character might be. T&ouml;rless's passion is described by
Musil as "a flight" (<I>eine Flucht)</I> from the feelings and thoughts
with which he had been "innoculated" in the everyday world and which
"gave him nothing and oppressed him" (<I>die man ihm einimpfte, all
das, was ihm nichts gab und ihn erdr&uuml;ckte</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 30;
"YT," 31]). This "flight" is clearly directed regressively toward the
mother, and it involves an identification with the feminine as the image
of self-dissolution, of shameless abandonment to the power of unconscious
desire, of degradation and humiliation. But T&ouml;rless's "love" for the
Prince and Basini also represents a recognition of the bisexual nature
of the "soul" which emerges from the maternal womb. The dissolving of
his ego defenses under the pressures of sensual desire brings to the
fore the repressed feminine "other" of the "stony compulsion" of imposed
masculine identities.

<P>
The confusions and contradictions in the psychic life of T&ouml;rless
become concrete, become "things" in the world, through his homoerotic
relationship to Basini. By transferring his enigmatic, incomprehensible
feelings on to Basini, T&ouml;rless allows his own unconscious desire to
emerge as a potential object of analysis and self-knowledge. His "affair"
is described as a psychic disorder, a hysterical or even psychotic episode
in which internal psychic conflicts are acted out and thus opened to the
possibility of conscious understanding. By working through his relation
to Basini, T&ouml;rless comes to understand the distinction between the
reality of Basini as a thing in the world and as a re of his desire
and sexual fantasy. He learns to control his psychic projections and
reappropriate them as elements of himself, distinct from the objective
realities of the external world.

<P>
During this process of seeking therapeutic understanding, T&ouml;rless
is placed in constant contrast to his two student mentors, Reiting and
Beineberg, who are also engaged in turning Basini into an experiment
for testing their present and future identities. Although Reiting and
Beineberg are "rebels" against the master's rule and trenchant critics
of the hypocrisy of conventional values in the adult world, both formulate



<B></B>



 their conceptions of masculine identity as a refashioning of the public
 roles of political domination and spiritual control over others. For
 them Basini represents a weak and contemptible object on which they
 can practice their method of controlling the irrational for personal
 power and egoic gain. Unlike T&ouml;rless they do not recognize
 themselves in Basini, they do not fall "in love" with him, or identify
 with his humiliation. They use him as a means to assert their own
 masculine superiority over his feminine weakness. Their experiments
 in manipulation and torture aim at refurbishing traditional models
 of masculinity autonomy as mastery over the feminine other, either as
 political domination or as spiritual purification.

<P>
Reiting and Beineberg are obsessed with their fathers and
forefathers. They define their own identities in terms of a fulfillment
of paternal claims and historical destinies, and their identities
are described by Musil as essentially "modernizations" of inherited
identities. T&ouml;rless in contrast, although he has a father, seems
virtually fatherless; or at least his weak and adaptive father appears to
make no claims on his future (other then giving him over to the control
of school masters and older peers) and thus allows him a relative freedom
to engage in the creative task of reformulating the relationship between
unconscious desire and individualized character without overpowering
historical baggage and guilt. Reiting and Beineberg are thus presented
as the primary alternatives of father-oriented masculine identities to
T&ouml;rless's innovative "confusions." Their strategies for dealing
with Basini illuminate the particularity of T&ouml;rless's therapeutic
refashioning of himself.

<P>
Reiting is the school demagogue who enters into the encounter with Basini
with pre-formed political ambitions. Modeling his future on that of a
Napoleon-like military officer with "daydreams of coups d'etat and high
politics" (<I>Er . . . rechnete mit Staatsstreichen und gro&szlig;er
politik</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 40; "YT," 43]), he sees Basini's femininity and
humiliating dependency from the standpoint of the manipulative strategies
of the ego, as signs of a pathological weakness on which he can build
the structures of his own power. Like Freud in his 1914 critique of
the ego-oriented heresy of Alfred Adler, Musil interprets this stance
as reductive, and, despite its revolutionary political posturings, as
ultimately conservative, and perhaps dangerously reactionary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
Reiting provides the students who follow his leadership with an escape
from their loneliness by creating a group identity formed around the
objectification and projection of their inner demons on to the chosen
outsider, and an identification of their potent, purified selves with his
own person as their leader and father. This strategy not only disavows
the reality of the inner psychic conflict, but raises the specter of a
dangerous diversion and simplifying reduction of psychic confusion into
politically organized mass identity and persecutory purification. Musil's
Reiting and Freud's Adler disavow the feminine within themselves in their
"masculine protest" against feminization. They thus continue to confuse
internal and external conflicts, acting out their internal fantasies in
relation to others. In Freud's terminology they reject the reality of the
unconscious and build a world from the standpoint of the self-deceiving
power of the ego and on the denial of "love."



<B></B>

<P>
In 1914 Freud paired Carl Gustav Jung's defection from the critical
reflexive truth of psychoanalytic investigation with Adler's heresy,
as an equally reductive systematization of the signs of unconscious
mental life into a reconration of religious myth and a traditional
theological world-view. In Musil's novel Jung's position is played out by
Beineberg. Like Freud's Jung, Beineberg approaches the realm that lies
beyond the boundaries of rational knowledge with preconceived religious
conceptions. From his father he has imbibed a powerful belief in the
reality of transcendent spiritual forces infusing and controlling the
world of surface phenomena. T&ouml;rless is attracted to Beineberg because
of their common recognition of the two-dimensional nature of reality, but
he ultimately rejects Beineberg's claim that the mysterious irrational
powers he perceives are signs of a transcendent world of spiritual
forces which must be liberated from their corrupt bodily habitations and
mobilized to create a purified new world. Beineberg is in competition
with Reiting as a self-styled prophet of a new cultural order and leader
of youthful rebellion against the masters. He rejects T&ouml;rless's
hesitating and unresolved ruminations about the double nature of
psychic experience, rationalizes everything into a dogmatic system of
supernatural essences, and trains himself for the imminent cultural
collapse which will provide the opportunity for his prophetic religious
leadership. Like Freud, Musil regarded such therapies of supra-natural
meaning and spiritual integration as both delusional and conventional,
as a recycling of old religious intoxicants in new containers. In both
cases as well, this stance leads to an opposition to the politics of
identity as an appropriate model for human association. In fact, Freud,
Schnitzler, and Musil all reject a type of political mobilization which
involves a projection of the internal other on to a social group defined
as the external other of the communal self. Basini might be construed as
the symbolic "Jew" in the Boarding school. T&ouml;rless separates himself
from Beineberg and Reiting in recognizing Basini as the psychic projection
of the other in himself, and thus also in seeing the real Basini as a
victim of his peers' lack of self-knowledge and their consequent brutal
acting out of their own psychic conflicts.

<P>
Both Reiting and Beineberg pursue the fulfillment of their father's claims
and shore up conventional notions of masculine autonomy as mastery over
the feminine other in their rush to resolve identity "confusions" with
new therapies of meaning and commitment. By refusing to go along with
their leadership, by insisting on thinking through the contradictions
of his psychic life, T&ouml;rless, Musil suggests, is opening up a
more innovative path. As T&ouml;rless works his way out of the crisis
of self-dissolution with various experiments at self-understanding and
self-construction, he does accept the validity of the existing parental
order of law and convention, but only as a crude, contingent framework
within which he can find working space to concentrate on the complex
formation of his own soul (<I>Seele</I>) or spirit (<I>Geist</I>) as
an individual person. Although he can find no rational or empirical
grounds for constructing a general theory of "the nature of man" he
remains stubbornly convinced that the construction of his identity must
proceed from a disabused investigation of the immanent,



<B></B>



 natural origins of his enigmatic passions and internal confusions. This
 process of self-construction is guided, first of all, by a principled
 recognition and acceptance of the irresolvable difference between, on
 the one hand, the fantasies, dreams and psychic projections which emerge
 from the never fully comprehensible life of boundary-dissolving passion
 and desire, and, on the other hand, acts and objects in the "daylight"
 world of clear boundaries, definitions and individuated identities
 connected with each other through rationally comprehensible functional
 and causal relationships. Both worlds are recognized as "real," and any
 non-repressive, non-illusory sense of subjective individual identity
 would have to be based on a consciousness of the constantly changing,
 fluid and porous boundaries between them. This double vision, however,
 also produces an ironic and detached stance toward the given identities
 of the apparently substantial and transparent external world, a knowledge
 that "it could all be otherwise, that there were fine and easily-effaced
 boundary-lines around each human being" (<I>da&szlig; es anders sein
 kann, da&szlig; es feine, leicht verl&ouml;schbare Grenzen rings um
 den Menschen gibt</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 140; "YT," 174]).

<P>
T&ouml;rless must experience, accept, and come to understand the
reality of his own "femininity" in order to work out and live a
realistic, unrepressive and undogmatic masculine identity. Autonomy
based on possession or full mastery is illusory, thus no autonomy at
all. Responsibility is not tied to fatherhood, in Schnitzler's sense of
accepting the obligations of social interdependence and generational
authority, but to the clear, disabused and critical consciousness of
responsibility for the individual self. This self must be constructed
within the constant and irresolvable tensions between the powers of
irrational desire and the necessities of social life.

<P>
In <I>Young T&ouml;rless</I>, the interminable construction of
self-identity is tied to processes of self-narration, to the capacity
to tell the story of one's own self-formation, to the ability
to imagine one's own identity as one experimental, and contingent
possibility. Within the novel the attempts to attain clarity about the
relationship between conscious rationality and the world of irrational
desire and fantasy through philosophical comprehension are rejected as
futile. For T&ouml;rless, Kant is no help in understanding Basini. But
T&ouml;rless does reach a point at the end of the novel where he comes
close to articulating his experience in words. He does not construct
a synthesis which would make sense of his experience in some "total"
or final sense, but produces an account which clarifies and makes
intelligible, at least to himself, the dynamic structures which governed
the sequence of events that produced the particular person he had become,
or is in the process of becoming. T&ouml;rless's self-clarification
occurs as he is confronted with the necessity of explaining his own
actions to the schoolmasters. The attempts by the headmaster, chaplain,
and mathematics teacher to appropriate his experience within their
conventional discourses force T&ouml;rless to become more precise
about his own particular perspective and the appropriate terms needed
to describe it. For a brief moment T&ouml;rless is able to articulate
what had been so vague and tormenting within him, so that his thoughts
emerged like the extreme visible tip of his innermost being, rather
than a lifeless system of words, or a wordless feeling (<I>VZT,</I> 137;
"YT," 170). He describes the double quality



<B></B>



of his experience and connects it to the unconscious dimensions of his
own inner life. He recognizes that the deeper dimensions, the something
extra which allowed him to contextualize all of his experiences as
simply contingent possibilities playing out against a background of
unbounded chaos and infinite extension, emerged from within himself. In
the world, "things just happen" (<I>Alles geschieht</I> [<I>VZT,</I>
125; "YT," 153]), and "things are just things" (<I>die Dinge sind die
Dinge</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 138; "YT," 171]). The meanings we see in things,
the words which define the identities of self and other, come from us,
and are contingent, "could be otherwise." This consciousness has two
consequences. It allows him to see the other as simply another thing
(either object or subject) in the world. Bozena and his mother, in
the concluding scene, lose their terrorizing auras as embodiments of
his unconscious sexuality. Driving past Bozena's house on the way to
the railway station after deciding to leave the boarding school, he
perceived it as "utterly insignificant and harmless" (<I>so unbedeutend
und harmlos)</I> and turning toward his mother, who is sitting at his
side, he thoughtfully "considered" (<I>pr&uuml;fte</I>) the "faint scent
of perfume that arose from her bodice" (<I>den leise parf&uuml;mierten
Geruch, der aus der Taille seiner Mutter aufstieg</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 140;
"YT," 175]). At the same time, T&ouml;rless's own self has become more
like a project than an iron cage of imposed identities. Recognizing
the source of his fantasies in the never fully articulated power of his
unconscious sensual desire presents the possibility of a future in which
his own self will remain an always surprising and never closed story of
aesthetic and critical self-fashioning and refashioning.

<P>
The narrator of <I>Young T&ouml;rless</I> participates with his subject in
this process of self-fashioning and self-understanding. At the beginning
of the novel the narrative voice is intrusive, authoritatively informing
the reader of the later significance of particular events in his subject's
life, constantly pointing to the ways in which T&ouml;rless's confusions
will be absorbed into a life understood as fashioning it's own self. By
the end, the voice of the narrator and that of T&ouml;rless are in virtual
harmony as T&ouml;rless learns to articulate himself in the words of
the narrator. T&ouml;rless himself is described as developing in later
years into an "aesthetically inclined intellectual," who can tell the
story recounted in the novel in terms of its exemplary significance
as a story of the fashioning of a person who is able to take his own
life as an object for critical understanding and aesthetic stylization
(<I>VZT,</I> 111; "YT," 135). In this sense Musil's conception of the
construction of self-identity goes a step further than that portrayed
in the contemporaneous texts of Freud and Schnitzler. Unlike Dora or
Dr. Schreber, Bermann or Wergenthin, T&ouml;rless internalizes the
narrator's perspective as his own.

<P>
In a sense the achievement of masculine identity in Musil's novel, as in
Schnitzler's <I>The Road into the Open</I> and Freud's early case studies,
involves a mastery and disciplined control of femininity. T&ouml;rless's
confusions arise from the release of his repressed femininity, from his
surrender to the passive masochistic attraction of the ego-dissolving,
boundary-effacing power of unconscious desire. But T&ouml;rless's solution
is not to disavow this femininity and project it on to the other, as is
the case with Beineberg or Reiting. Instead he learns to accept it. It
is the deepest, ultimately never fully comprehensible source of his own
subjective power to make and remake



<B></B>



his self within the context of existing possibilities in a world in
which things "just happen." But it is also one pole of that bi-polar
self for which a purified masculine or feminine identity could only mean
a disavowal of the human project of making one's own self an object of
critical examination and aesthetic work. Assuming a homogeneous masculine
or feminine identity would entail a submission to the unrecognized and
thus unmastered "other" within oneself.

<P>
Robert Musil was not Jewish, not Viennese, and a generation, or at least
a half-generation younger than Freud and Schnitzler. His participation
in the cultural conflicts of pre-war Austria and central Europe was
certainly effected by the particular cultural perspectives and cultural
baggage that he did not fully share with his older contemporaries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Yet <I>T&ouml;rless</I> does display a focused concentration on a
 number of dilemmas and themes which are mirrored in and shared by the
 contemporaneous texts of Schnitzler and Freud, and could be construed
 as tentatively mapping out a particular dimension of the "mind" of
 early modernism.

<P>
All of these texts take the ethical problem of autonomy as their object
of diagnosis and experimental investigation, but construe and reformulate
it as a problem of the construction of subjective identity rather than
the emancipation of a natural or metaphysical essence. The generally
recognized disintegration of conventional affirmations of centered,
autonomous subjectivity--their unveiling as "illusions"--was interpreted
as an opening to that dimension of psychic experience, the unconscious
realm of psychosexual desire that precedes the formation of identities,
rather than as a liberation of already preformed identities. Autonomy
was first of all an ethical issue and defined as the task of achieving
self-identity and self-mastery. This task was a practical, worldly,
immanent task. For Freud, Schnitzler, and Musil, transendence did not
mean escape into a realm of abstractions, pure forms, or timeless truths,
but designated an inner-worldly process of the never-ending, open-ended
work of self-construction.

<P>
As a contingent product that emerged from the shaping of undifferentiated
or "bisexual" desire, the identity of the person, of "character",
"soul", or "subjectivity", was portrayed as inextricably entangled
in the processes of gender differentiation. From the standpoint of
the individual's experience, gender difference was reimagined as an
internal, psychic polarity. The articulation or enactment of masculine or
feminine identity thus became an historical and ethical task, a process
of self-fashioning within the limitations of natural and historical
constraints. The articulation or enactment of masculine or feminine
identity thus became a process of self-fashioning within the limitations
of natural and historical constrants. In Musil, Schnitzler, and Freud,
the ethical task of self-definition and self-mastery, despite all attempts
to disassociate it from an inherent basis in male and female natures, in
biological, metaphysical, or historical determinations of gender, remained
bound to an idea of masculinity for which femininity remained either the
enigmatic, preverbal, never fully graspable ground of all differentiated
identities (the maternal ground of being), or the negative other of the
universally human ideals of autonomy, self-mastery, and creative potency.



<B></B>

<P>
The conceptual language of science and its precise analytical
distinctions, the experimentally controlled playing out of particular
programs, hypotheses, and "ideal-typical" models were necessary tools
for reconstructing the conditions and consequences of specific empirical
determinations of identity within the real world in which the ethical task
of self-fashioning was played out. The work of Freud, Schnitzler, and
Musil evades any easy dichotomization of art and science. They achieved
this symbiosis, however, by reconstructing both art and science within
the terms of what I have defined as an essentially ethical task. Science
became the tool of diagnostic critique, laying bare the conditions
under which self-construction could occur. The psychologies of Musil,
Schnitzler, and Freud were not so much sciences of the subject, as
critical and self-reflexive accounts of the limits under which subjects
were made. They thus recaptured the Enlightenment notion of a secular
scientific perspective which did not provide a coherent representation
of the world, but instead fueled a critical understanding of the ways
in which representations of the world came into being. Art, in turn,
was defined less by the tasks of constructing alternative worlds or
identities than by the project of representing the processes through
which such worlds and identities were constructed. As Musil noted in an
interview with Oskar Fontana in 1926, his novels were to be interpreted
as "contributions to the intellectual mastery of the world" in which
"aesthetic qualities" were subordinate to the direction of the "will."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P>
Finally, all three of these writers implicated the ethical tasks of
manufacturing identity and constructing an autonomous self in the
processes of writing coherent stories. In their works, narrative as a
representation of existence did not collapse but was recreated in a new
mode. The complex, reflexive process of narrative construction emerged
as itself a meaningful and coherent story. The unifying "subject" of
the narrative structure was reconstituted as the process of identity
dissolution and identity construction, a process which involved not only
the subjects in the text but the maker of the text as well. As stories
of story makng, as meaningful accounts of the struggle to construct
meaning, the texts of Freud, Schnitzler, and Musil appear as exemplary
representations of the "mind" of early modernism.

I use the word "home" here and throughout to designate a conception
of community in which individual identity is perceived as rooted in
and integrated into social being. In the German tradition the term
"Heimat" has developed strong connotations of nostalgic and utopian
longing, which are also clearly present in my usage. Among my three
authors only Schnitzler uses the term self-consciously.

Weininger dismissed the movement for women's emancipation as an
attempt to emancipate femininity. He claimed to support attempts by
individual women to become "masculine" (<I>GC,</I> 79-93). Similarly,
Weininger despised as an excess of femininity in men what he perceived
as effeminate homosexuality, but praised a type of Greek homoeroticism
in which masculinity was attracted to masculinity in a process which
promoted sexual renunication and spiritualization.

84-123. Musil later saw his construction of cultural types of Beineberg
and Reiting as prophetic anticipations of the political mass leaders of
the 1920s and 1930s.

The fascist body is a forgery. That is, it is wholly constructed,
meant for circulation, and stands in for a previous incarnation, the
v&ouml;lkish body, that of the people. The fascist body is fabricated,
renovated, reconstructed, consisting of extensions and projections. It is
frequently said that all bodies are constructs, but there's an original
sort of forgery at work in the fascist body, because it's a forgery of
a forgery, a stand-in for a prototype that never existed, the double
of a fake. I will anatomize the body presented in two texts written by
Wyndham Lewis, <I>Hitler</I>  and <I>Snooty Baronet</I> . In
order to do this, I must take two things for granted, neither of which
is true. The first is that there is a fascist aesthetic, and the second
is that Wyndham Lewis labored under it. I would like to propose that we
collaborate with such dreams of coherence and necessity, that we strap
them on artificially in the name of building a better understanding of
a particular strain of literary modernism.

<B></B>

<P>
My account of the fascism-modernism nexus is based on a belief that some
writers were indeed articulating artistic structures that served the
ideological interests of particular social groups. Whereas I can agree
with Robert Casillo that these structures sometimes evince pathology, I
want to track the aesthetic at work in the artistic structures articulated
by Lewis and to argue for a coherence of perspective that does not reduce
to either the ideological or the pathological.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 I will use prosthesis as a way to articulate a form of embodiment that
 encompasses but is not limited to the collaboration between modernism
 and fascism. From my vantage point on these two terms, prosthesis
 is central to an alternative strain of modernism in which character,
 identity, narrative-functions, and the bodies that move through these
 modernist fictions are constituted so that embodiment can be dissembled,
 reworked, reproduced, and rendered either unintelligible or unmotivated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 My contention is that our most authoritative "genealogy of modernism"
 is incomplete, and that there is a competing line of descent that has
 everything to do with bodies, ossature, and carapace, and little to do
 with psychology, motivation, or desire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 I will refer to prosthesis as a way to understand--and not just to
 supplement--the body in two texts written by two writers, Lewis and,
 briefly, Ernst J&uuml;nger, both of whom have uneasy relationships to
 fascism, specifically to National Socialism, and to modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P>
In 1930 Lewis went to Berlin in order to write about the rise of National
Socialism. During this last gasp of the Weimar Republic, Lewis wrote
what came to be <I>Hitler.</I> He returned to England and two years
later, in 1932, published the novel <I>Snooty Baronet.</I>

<P>
Ernst J&uuml;nger, who is one hundred and two this year, fought in
both world wars and received numerous decorations as well as literary
acclaim for his "Front-experience" book, <I>The Storm of Steel.</I>
"Total Mobilization," the essay with which I want to supplement Lewis's
textual world, appeared in an anthology called <I>War and Warrior</I>
that J&uuml;nger himself edited in 1930. "Total Mobilization" is a
pr&eacute;cis of <I>The Worker,</I> published the same year as <I>Snooty
Baronet,</I> 1932. J&uuml;nger looks to a future in which the individual
is ennobled by a ferocious relationship to labor, entirely integrated into
the landscape of a society for which mobilization is both means and end.

<P>
Lewis's novel concerns a one-legged and extremely snooty baronet who
writes scientific treatises on <I>People Behaving,</I> which is the title
of his first popular book. He calls these books "behaviorist" tracts;
they are a snooty science, artfully rendered (or so his loathed public
decides). Snooty wants to study "Man upon exactly the same footing as
ape or insect" (<I>SB,</I> 64) and writes two books that come to be
acclaimed, much to the author's chagrin, as "Works of Art" (<I>SB,</I>
65), rather than as science. Snooty is recruited by his literary agent,
Humph, to go to Persia on a publicity stunt: ostensibly to study the
cult of Mithras, but really to be kidnapped by native brigands, and then
heavily ransomed. The point is to provide Snooty with publicity. Snooty
cooperates, reluctantly, and takes with him the woman he loves to loathe,
Val, who is immensely unattractive, but at the moment rich. He hopes to
set up Humph, whom he also loves to loathe, with Val, and is disappointed
when it turns out that Humph already hates Val. Eventually Snoots and
Val go on to Persia, where they meet up

<B></B>

with Humph, and set to loathing each other in new ways. The fake
kidnapping commences and, because this is a Lewis novel, Snooty suddenly
shoots his literary agent twice in the back, killing him. Snooty
ultimately returns to England, where he becomes famous because of the
kidnapping, and writes the book that we now read, <I>Snooty Baronet,</I>
in order to clear his name--that is, to prove that he knew exactly what
he was doing when he shot Humph dead. He does not regret his action in
the least.

<P>
Michael Levenson has written about what he calls the condition of
"transitivity" in Lewis's novel <I>Tarr,</I> where any one character
can assume another's characteristics. Lewis's concept of character
is even more radical than that; transitivity is simply a symptom of
having artificially to extend one's self. Attendant upon this dynamic
is a routine dislocation of character, moments when character becomes
unhinged, when the most literal aspects of "integrity"--and by this I
mean bodily wholeness as well as rectitude--not so much dissolve, for
there is no mush in Lewis, as unfasten.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 This process is literalized in <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> where the
 protagonist first appears as a stranger to itself. "Not a bad face,"
 begins the novel, "flat and white, broad and weighty." (<I>SB,</I>
 15) And then, "The face drew back. The door opened. Grasping the
 forward jamb, a large man thrust out one leg, which was straight and
 stiff. Pointing the rigid leg downward, implacably on the sidewalk, the
 big man swung outward, until the leg hit terra-firma. . . . The face
 was mine." (<I>SB,</I> 15) And the leg is his. Or is it? We are called
 back to the moment of the double, of Sigmund Freud encountering his own
 face in the train compartment: "I at once realized to my dismay that
 the intruder was nothing but my own reflection in the looking-glass of
 the open door."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 This is the uncanny, the site of confusion between the organic and the
 inorganic, the unsettling moment when the animated is inorganic, when
 the leg is as foreign to Snooty's body as it is its essence. Indeed
 by the end of the novel, Snooty will be countering accusations that
 he is "<I>unhinged</I> (that is the expression, as if I were a door)"
 (<I>SB,</I> 252). Freud mistaking himself for a door, or vice versa, is
 the mirror image of what is in fact the case for Snooty: he is unhinged.

<P>
The European Unhinged underwent a great deal of reworking in the twenty
years before the appearance of <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> the years during
and following World War I. The war created "a new constituency of
disabled people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Bodies were mutilated at a new rate and in novel ways, while
 psychological trauma was brought to a new level of visibility. More than
 41,000 British men had limbs amputated after sustaining new kinds of
 wounds. The new frequency and forms of mutilation were due both to new
 weaponry like hand grenades, high explosive shells, pointed bullets, and
 artillery fire, and to particular conditions of warfare--mud, lice--that
 encouraged infection. Given the numbers of the wounded requiring
 treatment simultaneously, "within three days of a battle, a casualty
 clearing station might be swamped with 1,000 injured men and mutilated
 limbs sometimes had to wait days before being amputated." (<I>DM,</I>
 34) The smell at these clearing stations was much remarked upon; the
 gas that gangrene produces smells sweet, or "mouse-like,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 and in a world before penicillin, the smell of the infected and decaying
 flesh was overpowering. In addition to the new visible effects of war
 on the body, there was a new less immediately recognizable

<B></B>

consequence for the soldier's body: in 1916, 40 percent of combat
zone casualties were due to shell-shock. Overall, neurasthenia was
responsible for one-third of the discharges from the British army
(<I>DM,</I> 109). The debate over the cause of psychological ill-health
initially inclined toward the organic, but over the course of the war,
shell-shock was viewed as stemming from psychological causes.

<P>
All of this had the combined effect of introducing a segment of the
population that had never before been so populous, so visible, and so
altered; following World War I, the population of Britain was left to
integrate a huge population of amputees and shell-shock victims.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The effects were felt from art to orthopedics. While industry accounted
 for a certain level of mutilation within Britain, and birth defects too
 accounted for many missing limbs, these segments of the population were
 either working-class or, in the case of children, unenfranchised. The war
 fed into society a tremendous number of men with class standing, full
 citizen status, and even some social distinction, initially conferred
 by their wounds; a transfer of the resources garnered during the war
 resulted: the "gigantic plant . . . to help the disabled," the "army
 of people whose livelihood was dependent on maintaining a supply of
 cripples" (<I>DM,</I> 51), was redirected toward the general population.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The industry for production and distribution of artificial limbs was
 radically altered. The limbs were hard to come by; in 1919, a wooden
 artificial limb cost anywhere from &#163;15 (for arm amputations above
 the elbow) to &#163;22 (for an amputation through the hip joint), while
 the average wage for a skilled craftsman was &#163;2 a week (<I>DM,</I>
 45). An artificial limb made of aluminum alloy, which was lighter and
 thus preferable, cost &#163;80 during the same period. By 1922, however,
 after the British government agreed to examine the relative benefits
 and costs of wooden versus metal limbs, a government committee concluded
 that, given the relative lifetimes and maintenance costs of each item,
 the metal limb was more cost-effective and thus superior. While a wooden
 limb's lifetime was four years and cost &#163;120 every twelve years,
 a metal limb lasted six to eight years and cost only &#163;96 every
 twelve years (<I>DM,</I> 46). In consultation with the government the
 producers of artificial limbs agreed to lower the cost of their product
 and the metal limbs were increasingly distributed to ex-servicemen.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P>
My argument is this: the prosthetic body, that is, the body once
fragmented, now made new with supplemental forms of prosthesis, is
more than the sum of its parts; the soldierly body went through a
transformation from a historical, wounded body into a nonhistorical,
aestheticised body. This new body, the prosthetic body, succeeds
where the previous body failed. My claim is that the prosthetic body is
uniquely modern, has functioned in a way that counteracts the absorptive
tendencies of cultural transmission, and, finally, that it is an index
to a cold modernism.

<P>
In the beginning was the "mere body," prewar, cloaked only in flesh,
retroactively understood as fragile.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 This is the "tiny, fragile human body" Walter Benjamin describes suddenly
 finding itself in the middle of the battlefield of World War I, but it
 is that body before discovering itself in that alien landscape.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The second position, that of the armored body, is the soldier at war. The
 prosthetic body is the third position in a genealogy of body-positions
 available before, during, and after World War I.

<B></B>

The prosthetic body is as historical as the mud in the trenches of the
Somme. Certainly prosthesis is not a modern invention, but it is in an
important sense the apotheosis of modernity, a fantasy about the modern
body beyond the merely compensatory. But the prosthetic body, the mere
body after war plus prosthesis, is not reworked into another element at
all; it emerges first as historical symbol, then is stripped naked, or
as close to naked as the armored body can be, and reborn as an exemplary
instance of the new man, the modern body, and a body of literature. The
prosthetic body is a product of historical circumstances, but it embodies
an ahistorical promise, making available a new and quintessentially
modern image. As an embodiment of the uncanny, resting on the seam
between organic and inorganic, between flesh and metal, it literalizes an
aspect of the relationship between war and art, or history and culture,
that preserves its original contours as much as it gestures toward its
dissolution. The prosthetic body is balanced on the edge between the
pleasure principle and the death drive, a product of trauma built on
the promise of repetition. While prosthesis first emblematized, even as
it sought to resolve, a trauma that had fragmented the body, it came to
operate as a culture's fantasy of proof that the body not only survived,
but had been born better.

<P>
Any artistic movement is bound to absorb, with varying measures of
intention and wit, the culture that surrounds it. Modris Eksteins's
<I>Rites of Spring</I> gives us an image of dada dancers juxtaposed
with an "armored lookout man" from World War I; his point is to show
that dada took a particular kind of historical body and incorporated it
into its own aesthetic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Eksteins sketches the profound transformations that World War I had
 on the history and art that followed; it was the "event," and what
 ensued--dada, Charles Lindbergh, shingled hair, World War II--was the
 "consequence" (<I>RS,</I> xvi). Mud speaks: Eksteins argues that the
 landscape of battle was in essence avant-garde <I>avant la lettre:
 </I>"The whole landscape of the Western Front became surrealistic before
 the term <I>surrealism</I> was invented by the soldier-poet Guillaume
 Apollinaire. . . . A panorama of devastation confronted the soldiers
 in the major battle zones" (<I>RS,</I> 146). The mud that the soldiers
 struggled through and died in, "a kind of stagnant river, too thick to
 flow, yet too wet to stand," which "you left no tracks in . . . they
 all closed over, and you went in over your boots at every step and
 sometimes up to your calves,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 was transformed by the war experience into a feature of modern
 life. Eksteins quotes T. S. Eliot:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
. . . Words strain,
<BR>
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,
<BR>

Will not stay still.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Eksteins concludes, "It was as if words had become like the mud on
the Somme." (<I>RS,</I> 218) Prosthesis too speaks as both context
and formulating principle, but while mud became a symbol of culture's
quagmire, prosthesis emerged in culture formulated, retroactively, as
a unifying principle for the modern body.

The question of what appendages engage directly with the speaker in
<I>Snooty Baronet,</I> whether things in fact are or are not Snooty,
is a recurrent issue. The prosthetic device of his leg is lavished
with a measure of syntactical care that no other object in the novel
receives--and I number characters among those objects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The leg is called variously "my mechanical knee" (<I>SB,</I> 44, 76),
 "fitted with clockwork" (<I>SB,</I> 22), and "a nickel nether limb"
 (<I>SB,</I> 22). Snooty's prosthetic device is most certainly his
 (but perhaps only because no one else wants it); it is most his when he
 unfastens it, and later has to hop around looking for it; this usually
 happens before and after sex, which not surprisingly, since this is a
 Lewis novel, is supplemented by an explicitly unpleasant return to the
 organic: Snooty's character is augmented not only by a nickel nether
 limb, but by a silver plate in his head, which embedded itself during
 the war, and this plate has the effect of making Snooty retch following
 sexual climax. The first time we see this, Snooty's character is again
 dislocated by a return to the third person. Ten minutes after hopping
 into bed with Val, "a one-legged man hopped out. He was as naked as God
 ushered him into the world. . . . Sitting down . . . and bending over
 the gilt-flowered slop-vessel, this man proceeded to be ill. . . . That
 one-legged man . . . was me." (<I>SB,</I> 49) Engagement is awarded
 only to the leg--it is the only thing that truly engages Snooty; he is
 forever interposing his mechanical leg between the fleshier parts of
 his body and those of his paramours. This has the effect of rendering
 mechanical even those fleshier bits:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
As I spoke I went to meet her--as I started my mechanical leg giving out
an ominous creak (I had omitted to oil it, like watches and clocks these
things require lubrication). I seized her stiffly round the body. All of
her still passably lissom person . . . gave. It was the human willow, more
or less. It fled into the hard argument of my muscular pressures. Her
waist broke off and vanished into me as I took her over in waspish
segments, an upper and a nether. . . . With my live leg . . . I attacked
the nether half of my aggressive adversary, and wound it cleverly round
her reintegrating fork. (We were now both suspended upon my mechanical
limb.) [<I>SB,</I> 48]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This bachelor comes already hitched. At first it would appear simply that
his body subsumes hers--the latter "flees" the former; he disarticulates
her, literally, breaking apart her "segments." The segment of most
interest to Snooty is the "nether half," the lower region, which is
also the trickiest, requiring some level of cleverness in dealing
with its containment. This is the half that inspires in him the role
of the "adversary": at that point--the point on the body, the point in
the sentence--the moment of contest is clearly articulated. Val's body
moves from being fluid, "passably lissom," to being armored, at first in
response to Snooty's own "hard argument" but then in relation to her own
bodily construction: she is divided into "waspish segments." Val's body,
then, comes to echo Snooty's, articulated as it is in differing registers:
she, lissome, then waspish and aggressive, he stiff, then wending and
suspended. The blur of who is what--both seem at once mechanical and
fleshy, bipedal and pseudopodial--is paralleled by Lewis's organization
of units of time, and action:

<B></B>

bodies can flee without moving, and in fact here Val flees and vanishes
precisely insofar as she does not move; while integration ("her
reintegrating fork") is staged on a stilled body's petiole. The moment
of integration--again both topographically and syntactically--signals
the moment of the battle's climax, which finds both Val and Snooty
"suspended" atop the latter's leg.

<P>
Being disengaged from one's body parts, one's name, and one's own
character are repeated signs of disorientation. Many people end
up being "snooty," with a lowercase <I>S,</I> throughout the novel
(Humph, for instance, so antagonizes Val at one point that "He really
became Snooty"--note the capital <I>S</I> [<I>SB,</I> 205].). There's
no sense of a character's stability; <I>Snooty Baronet</I> is peopled
with duplications, or at least pale copies. The plot grinds out two
prostitutes named Lily, one from London, and one of the Eastern variety,
"whose name was <I>Lily</I> in Persian," Shushani (<I>SB,</I> 220).
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Character is not only "transitive"; it is contagious, with the result
 that entire characters are reproducible, courtesy of something like a
 character machine.

<P>
And as reproducible as character is, what it lacks is integrity--that
is, what might be conceived of as psychological intactness, a density
of thought and insight--pith. Snooty himself is aware of this odd lack,
aware that he does not quite <I>get</I> things; that ideas have no
resonance for him. He explains the odd look his face sometimes has, a
"heavy puzzled look" (<I>SB,</I> 134).

I have literally to drill holes in this sheep's head of mine before it
can get an at all difficult notion, or sometimes any at all, into it
properly. In all but purely mechanical things, of an external order
. . . I am a profoundly dense person, I can hardly help it. Mine is
anything but a quick mind.--This may be why I am a <I>behaviorist.</I>
. . . A notion goes <I>so far</I> in with me and not an inch farther. That
is what is oddest of all. It seems to stick in the surface shell. It
remains embedded in the bone, quite hard and fast. . . . Ideas come out
of the blue, fiercely to get us, like wasps, or like a bacillus or a
weevil dropped on a cork. I can feel one <I>strike</I> me. Then I feel
it get stuck . . . [<I>SB,</I> 134].

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is a wonderful description of what being a bonehead, literally, feels
like, if the word "feels" can be used here. Ideas, like wasps--this is
the blooming, buzzing confusion of reality (and remember those "waspish
segments" [<I>SB,</I> 48] of Val's buzzing body). But for Lewis, as not
for a Virginia Woolf character, one's access to interiority is wholly
impoverished; nothing quite penetrates the ossature that surrounds us.

<P>
Engagement with one's environment, however, has a nasty habit of
slipping in, and this makes the speaking subject-positions in Lewis
so slippery. Isolationism constantly needs to be reconstructed and
reiterated; the banquet that the narrator hosts for his puppets is
repeatedly disrupted because these dead things keep aiming their faces
in our direction, and it looks as if they are looking at us. You--the
author--have a habit of answering back, knowing all the while that there
is no one else in the room. It's just you and wood. But the conviction
in your own voice, that these things are so very dead, works to animate
you, and comes to animate them. Your animus animates them. At one point
in the novel Snooty stands transfixed by an automaton in the window
of a haberdasher, a machine in the shape of a man who tips his hat to
the public.

His character interested me at once. It is absurd to say these things
(if you insist on calling them <I>things</I>) have no character. Those
that are made to-day are, like characters in books, often much more
real than live people. . . . It was impossible as one watched him not to
feel that he was in some real sense <I>alive.</I> At certain moments of
course the imperfections of the apparatus would betray him. But is this
not the case . . . with the best of us? [<I>SB,</I> 133]

<P>
This is as close to a cri de c&#156;ur as Lewis gives, and who wants
anything more plaintive, except some people who really like dinner
parties, who actually believe that other people are listening to them?

<P>
Snooty gives what he reluctantly calls his own behaviorist "cry from
the heart" (<I>SB,</I> 252) on the novel's final page when he demands
justice, which is to say he argues for continuity in his behavior and
continuity in our understanding of his behavior: he is not, he protests,
to be misunderstood or "whitewashed" by Val as simply a "dirty dog"
(<I>SB,</I> 252). His behavior, Snooty means, is consistently without
internal motivation, or consistently habitual. The cable that Val sends
him, accusing him of being "a dirty dog," is what Snooty calls "snooty"
(<I>SB,</I> 252); the nightmare of behaviorism, then, is that behavior is
infinitely iterable. If all actions are generated by a human motor (more
of this below)--if there's no pressure to be individually motivated,
or unique--then an essentially Fordist notion lies at the heart of
humanity, which means we can all be built, and indeed we are all built
alike, which in turn (in this assembly-line logic) means that what I do
you can be, and so Val becomes snooty. Or, more formally, as Snooty says
in the novel's penultimate line, "If you are a true behaviorist . . . you
behave as I have behaved!" (<I>SB,</I> 252) The dynamic of this discourse
separates Snooty from his own situation: first, because by virtue of the
behaviorist theorem no narrative position is unique--you can't argue for
the importance of Bloom's day as it occurs to Bloom since, according to
behaviorism, you or I (you and I) will react in exactly the same way,
given the same circumstances. Second, Snooty articulates (in the sense
of enunciating the joints of an object/argument so distinctly that they
are readily divisible) himself out of what might crudely be called the
subject-position. In articulating his position as a true behaviorist,
he divides himself from the behaviorist position, since given the
behaviorist position there's nothing essential about being present to
an occasion (Val might as well be Snooty and in fact is). Snooty thus
ends by addressing an antagonistic audience comprised of behaviorists,
a roomful of snooty replications: "Put that in your pipe and smoke it,
all you professors of this implacable doctrine!" (<I>SB,</I> 252).

<P>
It's important that Snooty's last line is a parting shot, in a novel of
parting shots, because it enacts what Lewis's syntax insists on, that
we are all angrily and loudly leaving a room filled with people who are
unaware of our having entered it, because we bear an eerie resemblance
to the other partygoers. The syntax loudly declares its difference from
received opinion, the belief that we are all unique.

<P>
Lewis's syntax is wonderfully obdurate, and its hard-as-nails quality
replicates the structure of the bodies in his fictions. His syntactical
ossature works toward a form-echoes-function maintenance of indifference
and stasis; for instance, in response to

<B></B>

Humph's initial proposal to travel to Persia to learn about the cult
of the bull, Snooty makes "a rather violent gesture of deprecation--to
superadd to utter ignorance desire for continuance of same." (<I>SB,</I>
75) This is the literary incarnation--with the syntax enacting the
obdurate quality it describes--of the fin-de-si&egrave;cle nexus of
over-stimulation, nervous exhaustion, stasis, and modernity, all of
which Freud drew on when he likened the ego to a single-celled organism,
constructed with a thick layer with which to deflect nervous shock. The
combination of violence and stasis, an abstruse syntax evoking at
once the asceticism of science ("desire for continuance of same," with
its three-fold elision of articles), and a mannered affectedness (not
repeating "ignorance," instead substituting "the same" as if one were
too weary even of ignorance to sully one's diction with it twice) is
familiar--this syntax puts the "duh" in "fin de si&egrave;cle." Anyone
who has read Max Nordau's wildly stimulating book <I>Degeneration</I>
 will recognize the symptom of nervous excitement--because of wars,
because of cities--as indicative of the disease of modernity, with all
its concomitant pathologies. Georg Simmel too saw humans as guarding
against and shaped by the city; urbanity is the source of a particular
kind of degenerative effect, producing a new form of personality, one
driven by an increased "intellectualistic quality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In "The Metropolis and Mental Life"  he says that "the metropolitan
 type . . . creates a protective organ for itself against the profound
 disruption with which the fluctuations and discontinuities of the
 external milieu threaten it" ("ML," 326). This increased intellectualism
 is, then, a psychic buffer, one akin to what Freud described in 1920,
 in <I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle.</I>

<P>
Simmel's city--Berlin--produces a community of individuals who have
in common "a sphere of mental activity which is least sensitive and
which is furthest removed from the depths of the personality" ("ML,"
326). This "increased intellectualism" is paired with what Simmel
calls the "blas&eacute; attitude" ("ML," 329); both are the result of
a submersion in an overstimulating environment, and both are at once
compensatory and formative.

<P>

Just as an immoderately sensuous life makes one blas&eacute; because
it stimulates the nerves to their utmost reactivity until they finally
can no longer produce any reaction at all, so, less harmful stimuli,
through the rapidity and the contradictoriness of their shifts, force
the nerves to make such violent responses, tear them about so brutally
that they exhaust their last reserves of strength and, remaining in the
same milieu, do not have time for new reserves to form. ["ML," 329]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This blas&eacute; attitude is coupled with, Simmel says, the tendency
to experience one's environment in terms of equivalencies, while
"distinctions between things . . . are experienced as meaningless"
("ML," 330).

<P>
Both of these propensities, the blas&eacute; attitude and the calculus of
similitude, Simmel attributes to the effect of money on the metropolitan
economy. "Money economy and the domination of the intellect stand in
the closest relationship to one another. They have in common a purely
matter-of-fact attitude in the treatment of persons and things in which
a formal justice is often combined with unrelenting

<B></B>

hardness." ("ML," 326) "Unrelenting hardness" is of course the result of
seeing things in terms of their exchange value, rather than their meaning.

[E]xchange value . . . reduces all quality and individuality to a purely

Qualitative discrimination interrupts the flow of pure exchange,
forcing the subject into making an evaluative judgment for which he
isn't neurologically equipped; the metropolitan citizen is incapable of
"react[ing] to new stimulations with the required amount of energy"
("ML," 329). He becomes, in other words, snooty:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Indeed . . . the inner side of this external reserve is not only
indifference but more frequently than we believe, it is a slight
aversion, a mutual strangeness and repulsion which, in a close contact
. . . can break out into hatred and conflict. . . . Our minds respond,
with some definite feeling, to almost every impression emanating from
another person. The unconsciousness, the transitoriness and the shift
of these feelings seem to raise them only into indifference. Actually
this latter would be as unnatural to us as immersion into a chaos of
unwished-for suggestions would be unbearable. From these two dangers
of metropolitan life we are saved by antipathy which is the latent
adumbration of actual antagonism since it brings about the sort of
distantiation and deflection without which this type of life could not
be carried on at all. ["ML," 331]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Antipathy saves us from languishing wholly in the blas&eacute; and
its opposite, a chaotic welter of absolute empathy. Simmel takes the
characteristics with which Lewis fashions Snooty--the blas&eacute;
attitude, an "unrelenting hardness," and a literal investment in
antipathy--and produces a type; Lewis produces a novel. This is not to say
that Lewis read Simmel. The novel absorbs the monetary structure to which
Simmel refers, making Snooty a baronet with limited financial resources,
a writer who banks on aversion as the basis of his career. Money is an
important sign in Lewis, both of biographical predicaments (the author
never had it), and of a structure for narrative relations. It is the gold
standard of modern relations--a smoothly functioning system erected on,
and producing, aversion and indifference.

<P>
Snooty is chronically blas&eacute;. He yawns constantly--he is forever
bored, even by death--and we may look to his hearty gasps of boredom
as a key to his quintessentially modern ailment. Snooty is modern
man: ex-soldier, part clockwork, partly running down, but nonetheless
wholly functional, wholly productive; he is fully a member of the money
economy. Snooty is in fact one of the few artists in early Lewis fiction
who produce anything--<I>Tarr</I> has great descriptions of the artists
who receive visitors rather than work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Lewis's artists tend to be anything but transitive. Anson Rabinbach
 traces a compelling supplement to the genealogy of neurasthenia and
 fatigue, with fatigue being not a detriment to civilization, as Nordau
 and others have it, but on the contrary a reason for its success:
 theorists of the fin-de-si&egrave;cle postulated that fatigue was a
 way to ensure overall productivity, avoiding wasted energy.

<B></B>

Fatigue was seen as one of the mechanisms of an inner clock that regulates
what Rabinbach calls "the human motor."

<P>
With labor as our hinge, let's pivot here to J&uuml;nger's "Total
Mobilization." In the quotation above, J&uuml;nger looks to the
investigation of what lies behind progress; he wants to determine
what animates the puppets of history. This concept of progress
bears further dissection, and, having emerged from the War To End
All Wars, J&uuml;nger decides that the place to conduct the analysis
is the battlefield. "Mobilization" is the process by which a society
gears itself up to t a battle. General mobilization, when enlisted
subjects are recruited and sent into battle, has now, J&uuml;nger says,
"the character of a <I>partial</I> measure." ("TM," 125). To embrace
true progress, to realize politics as "the art of the possible" ("TM,"
126)--J&uuml;nger here quotes Bismarck--and completely reevaluate the
basis of an economy, J&uuml;nger envisions a process of mobilization
that is temporally and philosophically all-encompassing:

of a gigantic labor process [<I>Arbeitprozesses</I>]. . . . [T]here is
no longer any movement whatsoever--be it that of the homeworker at her

this unlimited marshalling of potential energies, which transforms
the warring industrial countries into volcanic forges, we perhaps
find the most striking sign of the dawn of the age of labor
[<I>Arbeitszeitalter</I>]. ["TM," 126]

<P>
The worker-soldier is to be subsumed into a landscape premised entirely
on an economic and cultural mobilization that produces itself as its own
end, rather than relying on the all too temporal flux of occasional war
as a social stimulant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Benjamin, in his "Theories of German Fascism" said that this "new theory
 of war . . . is nothing other than an uninhibited translation of the
 principles of <I>l'art pour l'art</I> to war itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The relationship of the individual body to the battlefield is
 all-encompassing. "In order to deploy energies of such proportion [as
 total mobilization requires], fitting one's sword-arm no longer suffices;
 for this is a mobilization [<I>R&uuml;stung</I>] that requires extension
 to the deepest marrow, life's finest nerve." ("TM," 126) This work for
 its own sake, <I>mobilisation pour la mobilisation,</I> brings up two
 parallels with the case of Lewis: the odd aestheticism of a yawning
 baronet who works--the blend of reactionary decadence and labor--and
 the subsumption of individual integrity into a landscape of supplements,
 a prosthetic work ethic: the sword now does not extend merely from the
 arm, but from the deepest reaches of the self.

<B></B>

<P>
There's a clock ticking inside <I>Snooty Baronet</I> that drives
this fiction to stasis--not to resolution, but to the "continuance of
same." That's why the book that we read, <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> is the
one that Snoots writes, as he tells us at the novel's close. At the end
of the plot begins the writing of the totally mobilized novel, grinding
out itself. Complete production, total baronet. Prosthesis can structure
the individual's relationship to its context, to the point even that
the seam between flesh and metal, or soldier and landscape, or plot
and character is entirely reworked, or disappears entirely. The novel
that begins at the amputated end of the book looks a lot like <I>Snooty
Baronet,</I> but this is a counterfeit ending, referring us simply to
its own body's beginning. The book seems amputated because its ending
is false. Snooty has to counter the lies told about him by Val, and does
so by writing this book, which ends with those lies.

<P>
Two years before writing <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> Lewis, as I said,
was in Berlin writing the journalistic pieces that would make up his

 a "man of peace." (Unless, that is, you publish a recantation of your

 Berlin looking for Nazis. Here is what he finds instead, when he wanders

Lewis has found transvestites. Far from being a diversion, this moment
is essential to the construction of the fascist body, the fascist body
both in the sense that the bodies Lewis was searching for in Germany
were those of National Socialists, and that the bodies are constructed
along the lines of the aesthetic we don't entirely believe in but are
compelled to account for. The moment is formally essential in that
the Eldorado Bar sequence--this is where Lewis strikes gold--is the
first part of the book. What he and the reader find (or are forced to
find--there is a grudgingly tantalized play in whether this spectacle
was the intended one) are bodies that are not at all what they seem to
be: they are "trompe l'oeil"; a breast is revealed to be a "wire cup,
with cloth stretched over it" (<I>H,</I> 25). The game, though, is not
terminated by a semantic distinction between metal and flesh; for Lewis,
you can't go home again, because the problem exceeds its construction. "It
is too true to nature by far" (<I>H,</I> 24); the joining of this metal
with that flesh does not allow for later distinctions, for nature has
now been trumped, or <I>trompe</I>'d, with the creation of a prosthetic
sexuality that exceeds nature by becoming far <I>too</I>
true.

J. G. Ballard says that prosthetics is "the castration complex raised
to a level of the art form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 However compelling that idea, a genealogy of castration is itself
 a prematurely amputated endpoint: I am arguing for a prosthetic
 supplementation to the body of modernism as we now have it, for extending
 it to encompass a wilder body, to paraphrase Lewis. This body acts and
 reacts in accordance with mechanical impulses that are not regulated by
 desire or need. If, as Michael Levenson says, explaining the shock of
 a Lewis character abandoning his double, "it is difficult to imagine
 Marlow abandoning Kurtz to pursue business upriver" (<I>MF,</I> 139),
 how much more difficult is it to imagine Marlow suddenly growing bored
 by Kurtz, and <I>shooting</I> him--without either malice or regret?

<P>
One way of taxonomizing this cold modernism is to call it a "reactionary
modernism," following Jeffrey Herf. Another way is to label it a fascist
modernism, as Andrew Hewitt has.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 But these terms do not get at the excesses of this modernism, the
 modernist body that is entangled with the hard metals of politics and
 sexualities that are mechanized by something far less familiar, far
 more unsettling, and something that we, at this fin de si&egrave;cle,
 are beginning to recognize as our own, mistakenly believing that we
 have constructed it for the first time.

<P>
Lewis's transvestites are twins of the soldiers on J&uuml;nger's sprawling
battlefield; they are workers in a landscape where beginning and end have
become moot points, archaic remnants of a narrative teleology; in this
case the narrative is sexuality. As Hewitt has shown, Lewis's politics
are bound to an understanding of sexuality that hinges on the wavering
boundary between the natural and constructed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 This is not simply to say that Lewis anticipates Judith Butler's
 pronouncements on the constructedness of gender; rather, it is to
 point to a historical nexus of fantasies about the corporal and the
 corporeal, in which labor is reworked as functionally anticlimactic,
 where production is so ongoing as to outweigh the object of production,
 and bodies are seamless elaborations of their surroundings.

If, as Walter Benn Michaels suggests, modernism is the
"research-and-development division of identitarianism," Wyndham Lewis
is the rat on which to test the applicability of that theorem.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Here's our rat: nationalism, race, and gender each are technologies
 that can be dismantled and reassembled at . . . not "will," because
 that implies a coherent agency supervising individual narratives, but in
 accordance with the demands of local circumstances. Identity-formation
 is reconstructed to fit circumstances; if you are German, you commit
 suicide, and if you commit suicide, you're German. In <I>Tarr,</I>
 agency is reworked as an attribute of the couple; in his <I>Mrs. Dukes'
 Million,</I> character becomes a crowd. In <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> the
 protagonist becomes most literally assembled; the ties that bind are
 readily unstrung; you can take off your leg or take off your literary
 agent. They are equivalent acts; both are without
 significance.

<B></B>

<P>
And what does it mean to have race, gender, or psychology
equally unprivileged, each so readily adjustable? The aesthetic
proposed is of total collaboration; identitarianism is simply no
longer the issue. In Lewis's cold modernism, the permutations of
available characteristics--race, sex, nationalism--are radically
rescripted. Identity and identitarianism--being a particular citizen of
a particular country--just don't work. They are both secondary concerns
beside a methodology lodged between satire on the one hand and the
modernist commitment to exploring the relationship between a sign and
its referent, a name and its subject, on the other. According to cold
modernism, you start at the outside, where resonance, be it psychological,
narrative, or ideological, dissipates. To probe any deeper is to ask
an automaton how it feels, "to superadd to utter ignorance desire for
continuance of same" (<I>SB,</I> 75).

<P>
Consider Lewis's much-remarked upon concern with the world's confusing
him with other Lewises, Wyndham Lewises, C. S.'s, and D. B.'s. Hugh
Kenner warns his readers away from the frequent confusion of the Lewis
under discussion with "another namesake, Mr. D. B. Wyndham Lewis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Lewis was concerned throughout his life with the possibility of
 misattribution, with all those other writerly Lewises; in 1948 he said
 that after his death, "My books . . . would be shared out among various
 writers. D. B. W. L. would get two or three more, Day Lewis be given a
 couple probably and the <I>screw-tape</I> Lewis have attributed to him
 'Time and Western Man.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The preoccupation with other people crowding in on the raft of
 a single name, the attendant anxiety of being misrecognized and
 forgotten, is continuous with the aesthetic that constructs agency
 from the outside. Lewis's 1930 diary is a compelling document in this
 light. Consider first that the diary is a reconstruction twice over: it
 is in fact a 1931 desk diary that Lewis wrote over, crossing out the
 days of the week to write in the corresponding ones for the previous
 year. In addition, the diary does not appear to have been kept at the
 time of the events it records, but reconstructed belatedly, at least
 in part, seemingly in order to assemble a narrative regarding the
 commission and execution of a portrait of one Lady Glenapp, when the
 finances turned sticky after the subject grew dissatisfied in 1931 with
 the results of the 1930 sitting. Other meaningful events--meaningful
 for our author--are recorded, among them, on 24 February, "When name
 was mentioned at dinner a man cried out 'Which W. Lewis.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 And on 11 September, "Was it about this time that she [Lady Glenapp]
 started calling W. by his Christian name?" And, in a stirring moment
 that brings to bear the best that paranoia has to offer:

Prosthetics do not simply extend what is possible (a metal hand
replacing a fleshly one), but articulate an altogether new set of
possibilities. Susan Buck-Morss proposes that early cinema was a form
of prosthetic cognition. The movie screen did not simply extend the
possible; it was a "prosthetic organ," rescripting potentiality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Tied historically to the development of modern warfare, cinema gave us
 new perspectives, literally, on "phenomena of the crowd" such as war
 and the street demonstration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 It shapes a new body with which to experience violence, positioning us,
 anaesthetizing us, sensitizing us. Politics is the art of the possible,
 as Bismarck, speaking through J&uuml;nger, has it; prosthesis is an
 extension of a political way of conceiving new solutions to problems
 and deadlocks.

<P>
The prosthetics of modernism give us a new genealogy, a line of
bodies embedded in narratives that rework the possible scenarios of
character--political character, ideological limits, modes and degrees
of identification, and integrity--into an entirely new script. The
bodies that Lewis gives us are cold, wild, and regulated by an ethos of
supplementation--a prosthetic work ethic that reworks interiority into
an aspect of what it means to function. Just as early cinema installed
in its audience a prosthetic mode of cognition, Lewis's cold modernism
contrives a new model of character in which prosthesis is the heart
itself. What is at the heart of <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> and Lewis, is
a prosthetic device that beats out laughter at regular intervals. It
ticks and talks and regulates the flow of narrative, but it does not
yield to more lissome, recognizable, or organic notions of empathy or
identity. Identitarianism belongs in this case to an outmoded set of
assumptions about stability and limits that cold modernism not so much
disregards as incorporates, reworks, and renders unintelligible.

<P>
In the mid-1930s the young pup of the Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie,
Roger Caillois, published "Mim&eacute;tisme et psychasth&eacute;nie
l&eacute;gendaire" in the avant-garde French journal <I>Minotaure.</I>
Caillois discusses various instances of insect mimicry--of environment
(bug as leaf), of other species (bug as cat), of confederate (bug as
other bug)--and the various ends to which mimicry leads--escape, surprise,
fecundation. He speculates too about the roots of the phenomenon: did the
insect world once contain a species especially adapted to imitation, did
insects gravitate toward environments that matched their bodies, or were
the matches fortuitous? He discards the notion of fortuitous "similarity"
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 on the grounds that successful mimicry involves a particular quality of
 relationship between the insect and its environment. We are dealing not
 simply with "combinations like any others," with mimicry being simply a
 randomly successful (in whatever terms that success is defined--fleeing,
 feeding, or mating) amalgamation of attributes that might well
 have led to death or celibacy; what we have is instead a "mutual
 organization," a "reciprocal topography" ("MLP," 23). Caillois says
 that the tendency to imitate--in this case the tendency of a butterfly,
 the Kallima, to resemble its environment, a kind of shrubbery--may be
 the behavioral vestige of "a set of cutaneous organs" that disappeared
 "once the resemblance was achieved" ("MLP," 23). That is, the Kallima
 butterfly once had a physiological system capable of molding the
 insect to any environment, but it froze, &agrave; la Lamarck, into
 a particular arrangement when the insect settled among a particular
 group of shrubs. "Morphological mimicry could then be . . . an actual
 photography, but of the form and the relief, a photography on the
 level of the object and not on that of the image, a reproduction in
 three-dimensional space with solids and voids" ("MLP," 23). The organ
 whose job it was to photograph the environment has evolved into something
 like an appendix, and this vestigial quality of insect physiology is
 important, because "luxury" ("MLP," 25) is the true concern of Caillois
 (and of the other members of his Coll&egrave;ge).
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P>
The surplus of activity that mimicry involves--it is often ineffective
or less effective as a survival mechanism than other behavior--leads
Caillois to link it formally and thematically to magic. That mimicry can
lead directly to death, that sympathy issues in cessation (an insect
looking like the leaf it eats, and being pruned by a gardener or even
consumed by its fellows as a result) leads Caillois to speculate on the
importance of the law of contiguity:

Magic derives from dangerous luxury, and contiguity is its key. Caillois's
insects move in a sticky world, extricating themselves from one
glutinous mass of characteristics after another. We respond to this with
fascination, in the strict sense of the word; fascination is the correct
response, for the result of magic is to freeze the victim, who is then
sacrificed, which, in the phagocentric cafeteria of the Coll&egrave;ge,
usually means eaten.

<P>
Insectkind suffers from "a real temptation by space" ("MLP," 28) in that
it offers multiple instances of the reorientation of the insect body
in such strict accordance with its environment that the insect body is
itself not merely drawn to that which resembles it, but finally freezes
into place as a conclusion of the environment.

Here instinct completes morphology: the <I>Kallima</I> places itself
symmetrically on a real leaf, the appendage on its hind wings in the
place that a real petiole would occupy; the <I>Oxydia</I> alights at
right angles to the end of a branch because the arrangement of the spot
representing the middle veining requires it; the <I>Clolia,</I> Brazilian
butterflies, position themselves in a row on small stalks in such a way
as to represent bell flowers . . . ["MLP," 27].

<P>
It is no longer redundant or doubled; it completes. This succumbing to
space is not limited to the insect world; Caillois goes on to examine
the "protective coverings" ("MLP," 28) fashioned by spider crabs, who
"collect on their shells the seaweed and polyps of the milieu in which
they live" ("MLP," 28). He quotes Eug&egrave;ne Louis Bouvier, who says
that for spider crabs "the disguise seems like an act of pure automatism,"
meaning that the <I>process</I> of augmentation is meaningful, and, as
with insects who engage in this form of augmentation, "the nature of the
bodies producing the contact is of little importance" ("MLP," 28). It
doesn't matter what you put on your shell, just that your shell has
things on it.

<P>
In the seemingly less leafy human world, Caillois concludes, we
find individuals who suffer from "legendary psychasthenia," in which
"the feeling of personality, considered as the organism's feeling of
distinction from its surroundings, of the connection between consciousness
and a particular point in space [is] . . . seriously undermined." ("MLP,"
28)

<P>

To these dispossessed souls, space seems to be a devouring force. Space
pursues them, encircles them, digests them in a gigantic phagocytosis. It
ends by replacing them. Then the body separates itself from thought, the
individual breaks the boundary of his skin and occupies the other side
of his senses. He tries to look at himself from any point whatever in
space. He feels himself becoming space. . . . He is similar, not similar
to something, but just <I>similar.</I> And he invents spaces of which
he is "the convulsive possession." ["MLP," 30]
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The possession here is entirely different from the oceanic feeling that
the Romantics described as available to those who climbed mountains
in order to survey and surrender to the horizon. That was sublime;
this is stasis. Caillois ends by noting that all mimicry works "in a
single direction: the animal mimics the plant, leaf, flower, or thorn,
and dissembles or ceases to perform its functions in relation to
others. <I>Life </I>

<B></B>

<I>takes a step backwards.</I>" ("MLP," 30) This may well be Caillois
playing Freud (if that's going backward); the debt to the 1920 <I>Beyond
the Pleasure Principle</I> is clear, if not noted: "alongside the instinct
of self-preservation, which in some way orients the creature toward life,
there is generally speaking a sort of <I>instinct of renunciation</I>
that orients it toward a mode of reduced existence, which in the end
would no longer know either consciousness or feeling--the <I>inertia of
the &eacute;lan vital,</I> so to speak." ("MLP," 32)

<P>
The muddy puddle of attributes in which Caillois's insects and psychotics
swim is homologous with what I have called cold modernism. Intellectuals
too re into the nexus of the bodies that dissemble by playing dead all
too effectively. He takes up the relationship between the intellectual's
renunciation of self and imitating the environment later in the 1939
"Sociologie du clerc" (Sociology of the intellectual), which is a response
to Julien Benda's 1927 <I>La Trahison des clercs</I> (The treason of
the intellectuals).
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The treason in question for Benda is the betrayal of "the purely
 disinterested activity of the mind" in favor of the adoption of
 "political passions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The modern "clerk" "is determined to have the soul of a citizen" and will
 "descend to the market place" along with the masses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 For Caillois, the idea of treason is far more ambiguous. The job of the
 cleric is to efface himself completely; he is "not a man, but . . . an
 organism where his person disappears. . . . Because in eliminating
 himself the cleric makes room within himself for the Church."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 As Denis Hollier points out, such self-abnegation paradoxically results
 in the same thing as the pursuit of pleasure: the loss of the self's
 boundaries; "clerical ordination does not leave the subject in possession
 of himself any more than did the pleasure this ordination opposes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Both positions are mechanized by the loss of self, the "pleasure in
 playing dead."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 These bugs and bodies are constructed to suit environmental
 pressures. They are extensions of locality, but their localities aren't
 at all specific or particularly meaningful: as in the world of the
 spider crab, it doesn't matter what you have on your carapace, just
 that your carapace mimics something local. The possibility of political
 and intellectual resistance from such a position is minimal. These
 bugs and these literary characters are not interested in explicit
 conflict (shooting someone in the back is aggressive, but it isn't
 confrontational); they are more or less artful collaborators. The
 prototype for these bodies is that of the insect, or more properly,
 the fantasy of the insect body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<P>
Most of the characters in the story I've been telling were fascinated by
insects. J&uuml;nger's entomological tendencies are well recorded; in
the epigraph above, he comments on his fascination and identification
with insects. Lewis owned and annotated a copy of John Lubbock's
<I>Ants, Bees, and Wasps: A Record of Observations on the Habits of
Social Hymenoptera;</I> he was also acquainted with the work of the
entomologist Henri Fabre, referring to him at the outset of <I>Snooty
Baronet,</I> and in two earlier pieces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 It's quite likely that Lewis encountered Fabre in <I>The English
 Review,</I> which gave them both early exposure to English audiences,
 Lewis's first published short story, "The 'Pole,'" appeared there in
 May 1909; beginning in November 1912,

<B></B>

the <I>Review</I> published translations of extracts from Fabre's
ten-volume <I>Souveniers entomologiques</I> (Entomological memories)
that had "not yet appeared in England" alongside articles on August
Strindberg and poems by F. S. Flint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 The first article, "The Weaving Spider: The Banded Epeira," promised "a
 series of six chapters from his 'epic of the insect world' . . . in the
 course of the next few months"; the series was apparently so successful
 that Fabre's articles on maggots and pond life appeared regularly for
 the next ten years, until 1922.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Bug-hungry modernists didn't languish unfed that year, however, for Boni
 and Liveright commissioned a "rush order" from their translator, Ezra
 Pound, for Remy de Gourmont's <I>Physique de l'Amour;</I> <I>The Natural
 Philosophy of Love</I> came out in 1922, complete with a publisher's
 disclaimer for the American edition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Although de Gourmont's work is devoted to the entire scope of the animal
 kingdom--his aim is to show "that the games of love, preludes, caresses,
 combats are in no way peculiar to the human race"--precedence is awarded
 to the insect, who receives more attention than do humans.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 While de Gourmont states that "on nearly all rungs of the animal ladder,
 . . . the male is the same, the female is the same" (<I>NP,</I> 127), the
 comparisons between species are often piquant because of the variations:
 "in the insect world the male is the frail elegant sex, gentle and sober,
 with no employment save to please or to love" (<I>NP,</I> 35). The most
 remarkable feature of insect society is the dominance of the female; most
 brutally put, "the male is an accident: the female would have sufficed"
 (<I>NP,</I> 60).
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 "[T]he social evolution of the insect has led to functional
 differentiations extremely complicated, and if not unknown, at least
 abnormal, to humanity. Bee society has the female for base, human
 society has the couple." (<I>NP,</I> 53) What these females <I>do</I> to
 these males is a subject of endless fascination for de Gourmont; <I>The
 Natural Philosophy of Love</I> provides wonderfully lurid descriptions
 of "headless nuptials" (<I>NP,</I> 126), the results of mating with "an
 ogress" (<I>NP,</I> 115): "cannibalism in sex" (<I>NP,</I> 120), and the
 economic advantages of "getting . . . both bed and board" simultaneously
 from your spouse (<I>NP,</I> 126); this latter is occasioned by observing
 the female mantis on her honeymoon. Devouring your partner "at both ends"
 (<I>NP,</I> 126) is simply the clarification of a slightly more woolly
 economy. De Gourmont was enough to sate even the most ravenous public
 for a while; between <I>The Natural Philosophy of Love</I> and <I>The
 Waste Land,</I> Boni and Liveright had the 1922 entomology/modernism
 market cornered.

<P>
The historical connection between modernism and the modern field of
entomology is at once striking and frustratingly suggestive. The surge in
the English appetite for books on bugs was concurrent with the period of
literary experimentation: from 1898 to 1900, 11 books were published in
England with the word "insect" or "insects" in the title; from 1901 to
1905, 8; but in the period 1906-1910, 23 books appeared; and from
1911 to 1915, 25; from 1916 to 1920, 22. The peak came in the period
1921-1925, with 29.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 While no one force determines the contours of public imagination
 (happily), the turn to insects, like the turn to artistic experiment,
 began just before World War I and developed immediately before and
 after the war too, as did modernist art. The English penchant for
 knowing more about insects, turning as

<B></B>

it did in the period from 1911 to 1915, is bound to the battlefield. The
public taste for entomology was not born with war--historically this does
not hold--but the militarization of British society was concurrent with
the fascination for culture's carapaces, for things with "the works on
the outside": French locomotives, insects, soldiers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

<P>
Modernism's orchestration of the embrace of insects and the machine
was evident to Pound. While his speculation in the postscript to <I>The
Natural Philosophy of Love</I> that the brain is a "sort of great clot
of genital fluid"
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 is notorious, the more important statement there may be rather his
 explicit connection of the human world and that of the hymenoptera:
 "In his growing subservience to, and adoration of, and entanglement in
 machines, in utility, man rounds the circle almost into insect life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Pound sees the connection between entomology and the machine age,
 between bugs and Vorticism. What qualifies as a machine? The biomorphic
 technologies of the Futurists looked to the Vorticists like objects
 of worship, mediterranean Romanticism recast with a tinny glaze. The
 notion of utility was lost beneath idolatry; <I>Blast</I> called this
 "Automobilism" and dealt with the depiction of cars in the Italians'
 paintings by simply noting that "Motor cars go quickly."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 That is, the simple fact of the machine is its use value. Pound's remark
 is certainly ambivalent, and in this speaks directly to one aspect of
 what was compelling about the imagination of a homology between man
 and insect: the idea of absolute performance, of total utility. How
 attractive the insect world must be to a culture in which the bodies
 of its young have returned harmed, only distantly recognizable as
 human. That the recycling of Fabre in the pages of <I>The English
 Review</I> continued beyond its initial projection of several months
 is explicable in light of the war. The insect body becomes nature's
 attempt at prosthesis. Ants, bees, and wasps don't bruise.

<P>
Prosthesis is at the heart of cold modernism, and in mimicry we have
the heart of the insect world, and its fascination for modernists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Mimicry embodies the prosthetic relationship to the environment: it
 extends the self beyond the mere body's "nature." It is the total
 mobilization of the self, which becomes so thoroughly jointed into
 another horizon that it disappears. While the fascist body is a forgery,
 the insect body comports itself as counterfeit. The praying mantis,
 J&uuml;nger's glass bees,
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Lewis's "demented arthropod:"
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 all emerge from a space where "there is no background, only intersecting
 planes where . . . the manner of intersection is violently rendered."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 The prosthetic imagination is inherently violent, born as it was on the
 battlefield, and built as it is from the mere body's amputation. When
 the wound has cooled the machine can begin.

Andreas Huyssen, for example, states that "J&uuml;nger is no modernist"
("Fortifying the Heart--Totally: Ernst J&uuml;nger's Armored Texts,"
<I>New German Critique</I> 59 [spring-summer 1993]: 5). His argument
is wonderfully argued if, alas, wrong. Huyssen states,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If modernist writing is consistent experimentation in the search of a
new language, the invention of new modes of narrating, the aesthetic
articulation of the conditions of representation within representation
itself, then J&uuml;nger with his often pretentious overwriting, murky
and pompous philosophizing, and persistent lapses into the jargon of
the officer's mess is a highly defective stylist, often closer to the
late 19th-century B-literature than to Flaubert, Baudelaire, or Kafka. [7]

Certainly J&uuml;nger's ties to nineteenth-century literature are
strong, perhaps lamentably so. But one of the things Huyssen fails to
take into account (or perhaps is explicitly opposed to), is the existence
of a B-class modernism. That is, just because J&uuml;nger's writing is
frequently--let's not be shy here--terrible doesn't mean it isn't deeply
rooted in modernist imperatives.

The writer D. B. Wyndham Lewis and our Wyndham Lewis at times received
each other's mail; the Lewis collection at Texas contains a 1927
letter from D. B. Wyndham Lewis in response to a letter sent him by the
British Sexological Society, forwarded to our Lewis; "I very much fear
you are mistaking me for my namesake the artist." He adds in a note,
"quite understandably, of course." (Wyndham Lewis Papers, Harry Ransom

Lisa Tickner points out that one of Lewis's seminal paintings,
<I>Kermesse,</I> is now lost after its owner, one (Richard) Wyndham
became so irritated that another Wyndham (Lewis) had copied him, and
copied him badly--or at least satirically--into a book about the failure
of mimesis, <I>The Apes of God;</I> the first Wyndham was so irritated
at the misrecognition that he sold the painting. Fortunately, several
fraternal twins of the painting survive in the forms of studies; one of
them is on the cover of this issue. See Lisa Tickner, "The Popular Culture
of <I>Kermesse:</I> Lewis, Painting, and Performance, 1912-13," in

Given that Caillois takes a quick jab at the relationship between
the field of scientific inquiry and the body of the professional as it
occupies that field ("for science everything is milieu" ["MLP," 28]), it
is worth noting that this description, Caillois tells us in a note, is
drawn from observations he made himself during a "deliberately aggravated"
attack brought on "for purposes of ascesis and interpretation" ("MLP,"
30). That is, we see Caillois's own body disappearing into the verdure
of the sociological field, or more properly, we see him displaying his
own invisibility. Whether we choose to notice (and beyond that, whether,
having noticed, we believe he is gone) depends on where we stand in

"[T]he <I>screw-tape</I> Lewis," C. S. Lewis, writes in his autobiography
that his childhood was close to perfect, with the sole exception of
having bad dreams:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
My bad dreams were of two kinds, those about specters and those about
insects. The second were, beyond comparison, the worse; to this day
I would rather meet a ghost than a tarantula. . . . As Owen Barfield
once said to me, "The trouble about insects is that they are like
French locomotives--they have all the works on the outside." <I>The
works</I>--that is the trouble. Their angular limbs, their jerky
movements, their dry, metallic noises, all suggest either machines that
have come to life or life degenerating into mechanism. You may add that
in the hive and the anthill we see fully realized the two things that some
of us most dread for our own species--the dominance of the female and the
dominance of the collective. . . . Much later, in my teens, from reading
Lubbock's <I>Ants, Bees and Wasps,</I> I developed for a short time a
genuinely scientific interest in insects. Other studies soon crowded it
out; but while my entomological period lasted my fear almost vanished,
and I am inclined to think a real objective curiosity will usually have
this cleansing effect. [C. S. Lewis, <I>Suprised By Joy: The Shape of

Both Lewises, then, read Lubbock. If C. S. Lewis is one of Wyndham Lewis's
evil twins, he is so by virtue of being the "good" Lewis, the one who
was put off by insects. This might be read as their differing opinions
as to the possibility for successful conversion: other hymenopterous
variations in their respective oeuvres include angels; both wrote
theological science-fiction trilogies (C. S.'s <I>Perelandra;</I>

The translation led to a contract between Pound and the publishers, who
advanced him five hundred dollars a year for his services. The books
were chosen by Horace Liveright, and Pound was free to reject any book
if he so chose. Under this agreement, Pound translated the de Gourmont
and &Eacute;douard Estauni&eacute;'s <I>L'Appel de la route</I> 
as <I>The Call of the Road</I> , the dust jacket of which gives
the translator's name as Hiram Janus; the two-faced Janus had conflicting
feelings about the commission, given that neither Pound's nor Janus's name
appeared on the volume itself, presumably in accordance with the rights
of the translator not to sign his name to any work he deemed (so read
the contract) "a disgrace to humanity or too imbecile to be known." (See
Donald Gallup, <I>Ezra Pound: A Bibliography</I> [Charlottesville:
University of Virginia Press, 1983], 35; and Humphrey Carpenter, <I>A
Serious Character: The Life of Ezra Pound</I> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin
Company, 1988], 385. Carpenter however errs on two points, stating
that <I>The Natural Philosophy of Love</I> was commissioned under this
contract and that Pound "could reject anything he did not like" [385]. The
contract was drawn up on 4 January 1922, following the completion of
the de Gourmont translation; and there is no mention in the contract of
the translator rejecting a commission, merely of his having the right to
remain anonymous.) The fact that the publishers, rather than Pound, chose
the de Gourmont further emphasizes the marketability--the availability--of
insects to the public imagination in the early part of this century.

It is important to note that a wide variety of modernists have been
fascinated with mimicry--witness T. S. Eliot's calling his poem "He
Do the Police in Different Voices" before Pound, as authorized Possum
impressionist, ventriloquized a new title; and Zora Neale Hurston stating
that "the art of mimicry is better developed in the Negro than in other

Ernst J&uuml;nger's novel <I>Gl&auml;serne Bienen</I> , available in
English as <I>The Glass Bees,</I> trans. Louise Bogan and Elizabeth Mayer
(New York: Noonday Press, 1991), was written too late to fall within the
historical scope of this essay, but, given its author, is not surprisingly
an almost made-to-order collaboration of soldierly aesthetics, entomology,
mimicry, and prosthetics. The eponymous objects are transparent automata,
larger than the average bee, and far more efficient, if difficult to
locate; indeed, the hives themselves are transparent, and only the
glitter of glass in sun gives them away. These "glass collectives"
 are manufactured by an "invisible master" , Giacomo Zapparoni,
who also heads a movie studio. The studio specializes in manufacturing
robots, rather than housing human actors; these machines include not
only extraordinarily attractive simulacra of human movie stars, but also
"fantastic creatures" such as "an Angel of the Annunciation through whose
transparent body and wings the surrounding objects could be seen." 
The connection between amputation, technology, and the insect is explicit,
as the narrator muses on improvements he can make to the glass bees:

In the first part of this century much modernist practice and marxist
discourse still treated the body and the machine as separate entities,
with the first often projected as a natural whole, the second as an
autonomous agent. So opposed, the two could only conjoin, ecstatically or
torturously, and technology could only be a "magnificent" extension of
the body or a "troubled" constriction of it. Even with the new machines
of speed and representation of the Second Industrial Revolution (e. g.,
automobile and airplane, radio and film), technology remained a demonic
supplement, an addition to the body that threatened a subtraction from
it. After Marshall McLuhan and Mark Seltzer I will call this paradox
of technology as extension and/or constriction of the body the double
logic of the prosthesis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Here I want to consider its role in the models of art and subjectivity
 espoused by the most technophilic of high modernists: the Futurist
 F. T. Marinetti and the Vorticist Wyndham Lewis, two competitors in
 the wartime avant-garde, two complements in machinic fantasies and
 protofascist politics alike.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P>
Today this double logic of technology is an historic limit that we gaze
back upon: the very terms "body" and "machine" seem almost archaic, and
they are no longer seen as so discrete. Yet this double logic governed
the machinic imaginary of high modernism, underwrote its utopias of the
body extended, even

<B></B>

subsumed in new technologies, as well as the dystopias of the body
reduced, even dismembered by them. In this way it also circumscribed
the modernist politics of the machine: for the most part one could
only <I>resist</I> technology in the name of a natural body or
<I>accelerate</I> it in the search of a postnatural body on its other
side. More complementary than opposite, this restrictive advocacy of
resistance or acceleration was as pronounced in modernist practice as
it was in marxist discourse of the period, and it marks a structural
limitation of both formations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P><A NAME="2" HREF="4.2foster_2.html"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_2b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A><A Name="1" HREF="4.2foster_1.html"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_1b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
After the military-industrial mass death of World War I, the first
position, resistance in the name of a natural body, became difficult to
hold. Even before the war this difficulty could be sensed in a movement
like expressionism, which, even as it insisted on a natural body, also
registered in its very distortions the impossibility of this ideal, of
its immaculate restoration. After the war, affirmations of a natural
body were mostly therapeutic or compensatory, and they did not last
long (e. g., the ambition of the early Bauhaus to reintegrate body and
object in a medievalist recovery of craft). The 1920s were dominated by
two tendencies: on the one hand, various returns to the re, often
neoclassical in nature, most of which were reaction-formations against
the mutilated bodies of World War I as well as the fragmented res
of high modernism; and, on the other hand, various machinic modernisms,
most of which

<B></B>

were also concerned to make over this body-ego image that had been
damaged in reality and representation alike (. <A HREF="4.2foster_1.html">1</A> and <A HREF="4.2foster_2.html">2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 If the neoclassical reaction proffered the nostalgic balm of an imaginary
 body that was pellucidly intact, the machinic reaction looked to the
 very mechanization of the modern body for a new principle of corporal
 order. At base, however, the first reaction was no more "humanist" than
 the second: <I>both</I> tended to treat the body as if it were already
 dead, an uncanny statue in the first instance, an uncanny mechanism in
 the second--that is, <I>as if the only way for the body to survive in
 the military-industrial epoch of capitalism was for it to be already
 dead, in fact deader than dead.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
Many machinic modernisms made a fetish of technology. They treated it
apart from mode of production and turned it into an object of art:
it became a force in its own right and/or an emblem of "the modern
spirit." This aestheticist occlusion of the socioeconomic bases of
technology was not limited to the protofascist aspects of Futurism and
Vorticism. It occurred wherever a machinic style was held out as the lure
of a technological future to which people were asked, indeed compelled,
to accede.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 In the capitalist West the image of the machine often distracted
 from the reality of industrialization, while in the communist East
 the representation of production often compensated for a lack of
 productivity.

<B></B>

<P>
Of course there were also critiques of technology in high modernism,
especially in dada and surrealism, but they tended to complement
the machinic celebrations. In fact the primary modernist positions
on technology pro- and con- can be schematically mapped according
to the double logic of the prosthesis. Thus, for example, Russian
constructivism mostly projected technology, in a communist system of
relations, as an <I>extension</I> of the body, and this in two ways
at least: as a transformation of physical sense (constructivism as a
"socialism of vision") and as a transcendence of bourgeois individuality
(constructivism as a collectivism of culture), all under the aegis of
the engineer, the new machinic man par excellence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The critical counterpart of this position was dada, especially
 the Cologne version of Max Ernst, which mostly mocked technology,
 set in a capitalist system of relations, as a <I>constriction</I>
 of the body. With the irony of a bashed ego, this dada red the
 new technological subject in terms of physical breakdown and psychic
 regression: in lieu of the paragon of the communist engineer, it offered
 the parody of the capitalist man-machine as infant-autist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P>
Other complements on the question of technology include the middle
Bauhaus and surrealism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Like Russian constructivism, the middle Bauhaus presented technology as
 an <I>extension</I> of the body, but in the context of a complicated
 rapprochement with capital. Thus, even as it too worked to transform
 physical sense and to subsume bourgeois individuality, it did so in a
 context that mostly abetted the capitalist rationalization of bodies
 and psyches. In this regard surrealism not only countered the middle
 Bauhaus with a presentation of technology as a <I>constriction</I> of
 the body, but also exposed this capitalist rationalization as irrational.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 However, rather than image this irrationality as a regressive
 breakdown of the body &agrave; la dada, surrealism red it, with
 broken automatons and fragmented mannequins, in terms of a castrative
 dismemberment. In doing so it disclosed the psychic underpinnings of
 the double logic of the technological prosthesis that governed the
 machinic imaginary of high modernism: the machine as a castrative
 trauma <I>and</I> as a phallic shield against such trauma. It is
 this masculinist logic that I want to trace in its most aggressive
 articulations: the early polemical writings of Marinetti and Lewis.

<P>
The desire to embrace technology, to accelerate its transformation of
bodies and psyches, is not bound to any one cultural politic. In different
ways at different times res such as Antonio Gramsci, Siegfried
Kracauer, and Walter Benjamin all advocated such an approach. Yet this
Left Fordist position cannot be conflated with the aesthetic militarism
of a Marinetti, a Lewis, or an Ernst J&uuml;nger. The fundamental
difference is between a marxist project to <I>overcome</I> technological
self-alienation dialectically (for all) and a protofascist desire to
<I>elevate</I> this self-alienation into an absolute value (for a select
few)--as a form of ego ecstasy (as Benjamin understood the technosublime
of Marinetti: self-destruction as "an aesthetic pleasure of the first
order") and/or as a form of ego armoring (as in "the new ego" proposed
by Lewis before the war, or "the second consciousness . . . outside the
sphere of pain" proposed by J&uuml;nger thereafter).

<P>
Nevertheless, both positions share one thing: they too are haunted by the
specter of the damaged body of the worker-soldier. The same is true of
the interwar critique of technology in the dysfunctional male res
of dada and the dismembered female ones of surrealism. (The dadaist
res evoke this damaged body almost directly, the surrealist res
much less so--and yet might they register the displaced return of this
repressed body onto the female body, with the mutilation of the former
now projected as the castration of the latter?)
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Here, I want to focus on the wartime formulations of the new
 technological subject in Marinetti and Lewis. These fantasies not
 only predate the full formation of this subject in the late 1920s and
 early 1930s; they <I>prepare</I> it in the sense that they imagine it
 artistically and incite it politically (in this respect both men were
 at war well before the war). Marinetti works on the first part of this
 preparation: to explode the old bourgeois idea of a nontechnological
 subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Lewis plies the second part: to imagine a new ego that can withstand
 the shocks of the military-industrial, the modern-urban, and the
 mass-political, indeed that can forge these stimuli into a protective
 shield, even convert them into a hardened subject able to <I>thrive</I>
 on such shocks. As our images as infants are said to prepare our egos
 to come, so the rings of body and psyche in Marinetti and Lewis
 might be said to prepare the technological subject of the interwar
 period--and to prepare it, as with the infant images, in relation to
 the fantasy of a body in pieces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P>
However grounded in the damaged body of the worker-soldier, this
fantasy remains psychic, internal to the subject, in particular to
<I>masculine</I> subjects prone to fascism like Marinetti and Lewis. For
this subject the body in pieces represents the energies that it cannot
bind, that it sees as fragmentary, fluid, feminine.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 With Marinetti the relation to this unbound body is often ecstatic;
 he likes to imagine his body exploded in this way. With Lewis the
 relation to this unbound body is often paranoid; he works to armor
 his body in defense. To different degrees both men were involved in
 fascist activities; here, however, I stress the implications of this
 involvement for the models of art and subjectivity espoused by them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P>
Suggestive in this regard is the account of fascism offered by Alice
Kaplan in <I>Reproductions of Banality.</I> Kaplan describes fascism as a
"polarity machine" whose ideological power lies in its <I>binding</I>
of such traditional opposites as Left and Right, revolutionary and
conservative, populist and elitist, modern and antimodern, technological
and primitive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 This binding is signaled in the etymology of the term: in the
 <I>fasces,</I> the rods wrapped round an ax as a symbol of power in
 Rome; in the <I>fascia,</I> the tissue that binds muscles; and in other
 cognates to do with a strapping of energies of all sorts. Apparent
 in the paranoid nature of fascist politics (especially faced with the
 threat of communist revolution), it is also active in the spectacular
 nature of fascist cultures (in its libidinal binding of masses to party
 and leader in the collapse of bourgeois political institutions). This
 binding speaks to the extreme volatility of fascism: just as binding
 is doubled by unbinding, so is the fascist will to absolute order
 countervailed by the fascist desire for sublime transgression at the
 level of individual body and body politic alike. Both Futurism and
 Vorticism exhibit this tension

<B></B>

between binding and unbinding; at the level of the subject, the
ideological function of these movements may center on the aesthetic
management of this tension.

<P>
Freud uses the terms <I>"Bindung"</I> and <I>"Entbindung"</I> to describe
the different states of instinctual energy in the human subject: bound,
submitted to control, or unbound, open to discharge. The first object of
binding is the ego, which in turn becomes the primary agent of further
binding. If the ego is breached in situations of shock, the process of
integration is threatened: thus the imperative to shield the ego or to
shore it up after its breaching. It is in relation to such shock, real and
fantasmatic, experienced and expected, that Marinetti and Lewis develop
models of art and subjectivity. But binding and unbinding not only concern
the ego understood as an energistic entity under pressure from within
and without; they also bear on the ego understood as an image, a body
image, whose inside and outside are always in doubt. For Freud the ego is
"first and foremost a bodily ego . . . a projection of a surface"; it
is founded in this projection, in an identification with this body image.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Lacan pushes this account further: as the body image is other, our
 identification with it is also our alienation from it, which in turn
 produces an aggressivity, an aggressivity that is "the correlative
 tendency" of the narcissistic founding of the ego. On the one hand,
 then, the ego is constituted in armoring (a term Lacan uses in "The
 Mirror Stage") and, on the other hand, it is given over to aggression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P>
Armoring and aggression are thus in tension vis-&agrave;-vis the ego, as
are binding and unbinding vis-&agrave;-vis instinctual energy, and these
tensions are evident in the models proposed by Marinetti and Lewis. Lewis
advocates armoring: "Deadness is the first condition of art," he writes
in his first novel <I>Tarr</I> (1916-18). "The armored hide of the
hippopotamus, the shell of the tortoise, feathers and machinery. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Marinetti meanwhile "exalts aggressive action," most famously in "The
 Founding and Manifesto of Futurism" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Lewis seeks to bind ego and energy: "I resist the process of melting,"
 he writes in <I>Blasting and Bombardiering.</I> "It's myself I want to
 conserve" (<I>BB,</I> 15). Marinetti celebrates unbinding: "Art," he
 states in "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature" , "is the
 need to destroy and scatter oneself" (<I>M,</I> 89). Two points should
 be noted straightaway. First, neither Lewis nor Marinetti follows the
 Freudian formula for the proper release of instinctual energy--i. e.,
 that the subject bind stimuli in order to discharge them, <I>to be safely
 rid of them.</I> And second, for both men this tension is red in
 the machine: it attracts them not for its utilitarian and productivist
 possibilities but for its imagistic and energistic qualities--because it
 can image both the dynamism of the instincts and the armoring of the ego.

The place to begin this argument is obvious enough: the first manifesto
of Futurism, published in Paris in 1909 by the thirty-three-year-old
Marinetti. Like several origin myths in high modernism, this one is
structured as a rebirth: it opens with a small group of young men in a
claustrophobic interior in high-bourgeois Milan,

<B></B>

who, once roused to the Futurist call, burst open this metaphorical
womb. As a bursting, this rebirth is also a death ("I stretched out
on my car," Marinetti exclaims, "like a corpse on its bier" [<I>M,</I>
40]). But it is a death necessary to rebirth as a technological subject,
as the Futurists emerge as modern "centaurs," half men, half machines
("Look there, on the earth, the very first dawn" [<I>M,</I> 40]).

<P>
The blurring of birth and death in the conjoining of man and machine
is typical of Marinetti. In the first manifesto it recurs in the famous
baptism of the car crash:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Oh! Maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair factory drain! I
gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I remembered the blessed black
breast of my Sudanese nurse. . . . When I came up--torn, filthy, and
stinking--from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy
deliciously pass through my heart! [<I>M,</I> 40-41]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This baptism evokes the typical moment in the legend of the hero or the
artist when a new identity is bestowed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Here the baptism is industrial, the new identity technological, but
 the metaphor of rebirth remains. In a sense this is a fantasy of
 <I>cloacal</I> rebirth (maternal ditch, muddy water) in which, along
 the lines of the symbolic slippage that Freud locates in the anal stage,
 the subject is positioned at once as feces, baby, and penis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 This cloacal fantasy serves Marinetti in several ways. At the level
 of the unconscious, it allows his man-machine conjunction to appear
 as a regression to the pre-Oedipal--that is, as a release from sexual
 difference, from any division or lack, especially nestled as he is in
 the memory of "the blessed black breast of my Sudanese nurse." Here
 the machinic fantasy of origin is doubled by a primitivist one--a
 combination frequent in high modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 And this double release from lack permits the result of this conjunction,
 his new technological self, to be imagined as <I>a phallus free of
 castration,</I> a phallus, moreover, that Marinetti both creates and
 embodies (per the Freudian principle of cloacal birth: "if babies
 are born through the anus then a man can give birth just as well as
 a woman").
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Torn and filthy when plunged into the maternal ditch, he emerges whole
 and clean, a white-hot vulcanic body, perfectly phallic. This is the
 psychic reward of this technological rite of passage, and it is one he
 repeats in his writings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P><A HREF="4.2foster_3.html" NAME="3"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_3b.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
Everyone knows that Futurism celebrates <I>speed.</I> But in Marinetti
speed means more than new machines of movement, more than a new
technological sensorium: it is also a psychic re, a trope of time
travel, a way to beat the clock in order to recreate the self. Thus his
plunge into the ditch is also a plunge into the past: in a sense the
car crash is a primal scene in which Marinetti not only observes his
conception but reimagines it, a family romance in which he not only
chooses his parents but becomes them. This seems an incestuous move,
"an attempted end-run around Oedipus": to become the father in order to
displace him to be with the mother.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Yet the desire at work in this episode is more delirious (Marinetti is
 father, sacrificial son, phallic child . . . ). For a moment he arrests
 this mobility in the contradictory person of the Sudanese nurse, a
 colonialist fantasy both maternal and seductive, technological and
 "primitive." But she cannot deliver the goods either, for again his
 ultimate

<B></B>

desire is not so much incestuous as it is phallic: <I>to be</I> the
phallus. Only the machine can produce the phallus for him, can produce
it <I>as him,</I> or so Marinetti imagines. And in his texts women do
drop out in favor of machines: the intercourse he desires is with cars,
planes, ships, trains--any machine of transport in which he can imagine
his body-psyche reforged phallicly (<A HREF="4.2foster_3.html"> 3</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

<P>
Marinetti thinks this "redoubling" in two related ways. I noted his
fantasy of self-birth, of autogenesis, but he is also obsessed with the
fantasy of "a mechanical son, the fruit of pure will" (<I>M,</I> 75).
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 This fantasy of technological procreation is active in other machinic
 modernisms too (Fernand L&eacute;ger is especially prone to it), and
 it is mocked as such in the impotent "bachelor machines" of dada and
 surrealism (for example, <I>Girl Born Without a Mother</I> by Francis
 Picabia [1917], or <I>Self-Constructed Small Machine</I> by Ernst
 [1919]). Yet the fantasy is most extreme in movements such as Futurism,
 which aspire to technologize nature and to naturalize technology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 In this

<B></B>

crossing, the human and the natural are far from reconciled; rather,
they are forced into identity as a violent technological hybrid that is
red as autonomous--autonomously creative and destructive. And often in
Marinetti the issue is a landscape, at once internal and external, that
cannot conceal the sadistic violence of its own imagining. Consider, for
example, this Futurist scene: "Multicolored billboards on the green of
the fields, iron bridges that chain the hills together, surgical trains
that pierce the blue belly of the mountains, enormous turbine pipes,
new muscles of the earth, may you be praised by the Futurist poets"
(<I>M,</I> 67-68).

<P>
Marinetti does not embrace the technological in order to usurp the
procreative, for, again, he desires not to be the mother but to be
what she is said to desire: the phallus. This desire overdetermines
not only his machinic fantasies (remember the machine is to deliver
him thus) but his misogynist outbursts as well. This misogyny is more
fundamental than either the absence of women in Futurism or its attack
on the feminine and the feminist alike. At the psychic level, Marinetti
resents women because of his desire not only to be self-born but to be
so as the phallus--which is to say, in the Lacanian formulation, as The
Woman. And this leads to the great irony of his work: his frenzied attempt
to override sexual difference is played out, hyperbolically, according
to its terms. (Lewis is even more misogynist, but in the classical way:
he resents women because they threaten him with what he is not. Marinetti
resents women <I>because they re what he wants to become.)</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P>
I draw this Lacanian formulation from "The Meaning of the Phallus"
, where sexual difference is defined in terms of "having" or
"being" the phallus. But, Lacan is quick to add, no one has it as such;
a signifier cannot be possessed in this way. Thus in the heterosexual
"comedy" there is with the man "an 'appearing' which gets substituted
for the 'having,'" and with the woman a masking of the lack.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 In this account masculinity is no less a display than femininity is a
 masquerade; in fact the man is more fraudulent than the woman, for at
 least he is <I>supposed</I> to have the phallus, while she is under no
 such burden of pretense.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 So it is that some men compensate for this lack of the phallus with a
 display of virility. And yet there is a catch here too, for according
 to Lacan this display is "feminine" as well, and so the very show of
 virility may "feminize" these men further. This conundrum is pronounced
 in the early polemical writings of Marinetti. First he desires to be
 self-born, a desire that "feminizes" him, as does his desire to become
 the phallus, also deemed a "feminine" position. Then his very show of
 virility, indeed of misogyny, may "feminize" him all the more. (Marinetti
 was often seen as histrionic, if not hysterical.) Might this conundrum
 have compounded his anxiety, heightened his desire to change his body--to
 shed it altogether in a machinic conjunction? In any case, male-female
 difference cannot be mapped directly onto human-machine difference here:
 a third term, "homo-technological" perhaps, overcodes these oppositions.

<P>
These two related fantasies--to be self-born and to become a
machine-phallus--also govern Marinetti on art and literature, which he
understands as work on signifier and subjectivity simultaneously. In
order to prepare for the new ego, the old bourgeois subject must first
be destroyed: thus his persistent attacks, both polemical and

<B></B>

poetic, on subjectivity understood as interiority (this is even more
pronounced in Lewis). "Destroy the <I>I</I> in literature," Marinetti
exclaims in "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature," "that is,
all psychology" (<I>M,</I> 87). Again and again he calls on Futurist
art and writing to make over bodies and psyches as the new technologies
seem to have done. In "Technical Manifesto" Marinetti enlists the flight
of an airplane to attack "the old shackles of logic" (<I>M,</I> 84). In
"Geometric and Mechanical Splendor and the Numerical Sensibility" ,
the pitching of a ship bridge rebuffs traditional "human psychology"
(<I>M,</I> 97). And in "Tactilism" an artillery battery is said to be
the inspiration of his "tactile art" (<I>M,</I> 109). In all these ways
Marinetti poses technological shock against "the old syntax" of the
bourgeois subject, its culture, experience, and sense.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P>
This attack is the crux of his poetic texts as well, especially the
words-in-freedom. Often in these works word and image fly apart: the
text is literally released into the tactility of nonsensical sounds and
energistic gestures, and the syntax of the old subject is ratively
scattered. But what of the syntax of the new subject to be constructed? In
a text on declamation  Marinetti calls on Futurists to "dehumanize"
the voice and to "metallize" the face, to render the body as anonymous
as "semaphores" and geometrical as "pistons" (<I>M,</I> 144). In
"Multiplied Man and the Reign of the Machine" from <I>War, the World's
Only Hygiene,</I> he sees this "bodily development" as a metamorphosis of
an aviator into an airplane (with the breastbone extruded "in the form
of a prow" and so on [<I>M,</I> 91]). At times Marinetti thinks this
techno-transformation in terms of "pure will" (<I>M,</I> 75), at times
in terms of the "transformational hypothesis" of Jean Lamarck (<I>M,</I>
91), according to which one generation inherits the physical attributes
evolved by the generations before it. For Marinetti, the Futurist subject
must accelerate this process, must will this evolution; only then might
he "be endowed with surprising organs: organs adapted to the needs of
a world of ceaseless shocks" (<I>M,</I> 91).

<P>
Here Marinetti almost anticipates the Freudian hypothesis, also influenced
by Lamarck, according to which an organism constructs a "protective
shield" <I>(Reizschutz)</I> out of stimuli from the world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 In this hypothesis, which is also suggestive in relation to Lewis, the
 shield develops as the surface of the organism hardens into inorganicity
 under the force of these stimuli--all so that the central nervous system
 at its core may live. "<I>Protection against</I> stimuli," Freud writes
 in a famous line from <I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I> ,
 "is an almost more important function for the living organism than
 <I>reception of</I> stimuli" (<I>BPP,</I> 21). For the human organism
 in the military-industrial epoch of capitalism, Marinetti implies, this
 process has hypertrophied: the extruded shield is now a technological
 organ that (<I>pace</I> Freud) has "grown on to him," and the stimuli
 of the world are so many shocks pure and simple. In effect modern
 technology has transformed the dialectic of shield and stimulus-shock,
 subsumed both terms in such a way that the human organism now needs
 technology as <I>both</I> shield and stimulus-shock--and needs more of
 the shield because it needs more of the stimulus-shock. The effects of
 this technobiological addiction are clear,

<B></B>

and Marinetti celebrates them. The Futurists "lust for danger" (<I>M,</I>
67). "Our nerves demand war . . . " (<I>M,</I> 46). And then, almost as an
afterthought regarding the re that represents the <I>non</I>shielded
for this subject, he adds, "Our nerves demand war and despise women."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<P>
In this intimation of the dialectic of shield and stimulus-shock, might
Marinetti also intuit the greater hypothesis of <I>Beyond the Pleasure
Principle,</I> that the fundamental instinct of the organism is to return
to its prior state of inanimation, to the inorganicity of its death? There
is no doubt that Marinetti was fascinated by the breaching of the body
ego. For Freud, of course, the response to this breaching is a binding,
a binding that develops through repetition. But this repetition cannot be
controlled: it conduces to a becoming-inorganic not only of the protective
shield but of the death drive. In his double move to reify the body and
to vitalize things, "to substitute for human psychology, now exhausted,
the lyric obsession with matter" (<I>M,</I> 87), Marinetti seems to
intuit this process. More, he seems to embrace it, <I>to transvalue
the death drive as the very principle of self-preservation, indeed of
self-exaltation.</I> For Marinetti the way not only to survive but to
thrive in the military-industrial epoch of capitalism is to exacerbate
its fetishistic process of reification: on the one hand, in a Lamarckian
evolution, to extrapolate the human toward the inorganic-technological,
on the other hand to trope the inorganic-technological as the epitome
of the human; on the one hand to be already dead, on the other hand to
stake the future of "life" on technology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Further, Marinetti suggests not only that the best protection against
 modern mass death is to be deader than dead, but that this reification
 must be turned into a libidinal process, that we must <I>desire</I> our
 ultimate self-alienation, our own destruction, as the most sublime of
 modern experiences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P>
I will return to this transvaluation of the death drive with Lewis; for
a moment I want to remain with the Lamarckian transformation of man
into machine in Marinetti. In <I>Capital</I>  Marx argued that
capitalism <I>subjects</I> the industrial worker to the machine: like
the commodity, it comes to be seen as more vital than the worker, and the
worker more automatic than it. Fifty-five years later, in <I>History and
Class Consciousness</I> , Georg Luk&aacute;cs, a contemporary of
Marinetti, argued that, with the advent of Taylorist-Fordist practices,
capitalism now <I>fragments</I> this worker as well: mechanization
penetrates body and psyche alike. Marinetti reverses both these marxist
accounts. Rather than master the machine, he admonishes the worker to
be "educated" by it (<I>M,</I> 92), for <I>its</I> mastery is the only
one that now exists. And rather than resist the machine as a force of
fragmentation and reification, he urges that it be embraced as the very
re of totality and vitality, as the modern paragon of these states.

<P>
In this way Marinetti conceives technology not as a violation of body
and nature but as a means to reconre both as better than new, more
than whole. This is a fetishistic operation--to turn an agent of a trauma
into a shield against this same trauma. But as such it presents Marinetti
with a problem. In Freud the fetish is not only a "protection" against
castration; it is also a "memorial" to it: the fetish may

<B></B>

occlude recognition of castration, but it cannot erase it; sometimes
the fetish reinscribes castration in its very form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 The trauma is never undone, its threat never exorcized. And so it
 is with the machine: it may re a new totality, a dynamic phallic
 body, but it cannot rectify the old fragmentation nor make good the
 originary castration of the subject. In this way the double logic of
 the prosthesis may replicate that of the fetish: the prosthesis cannot
 undo its reason for being; it may even underscore that the subject is
 defined in lack. Marinetti is caught in this bind between recognition
 of psychic castration and faith in the technological phallus, and it
 pushes him toward an extreme "solution": the only way to pass beyond
 this bind, he seems to sense, is to lose this lack, to castrate this
 castration--in short, to get rid of the body in an ecstatic embrace
 of the machine, an embrace that will either subsume the body or blow
 it to smithereens. In a way this is parallel to the paradoxical logic
 that, according to Catherine Millot, incites the male transsexual to
 undergo actual castration: in order to become the phallus, he must lose
 the penis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 So too, in order to become the technological phallus, Marinetti must
 lose the penile body. In effect Marinetti is an imaginary transsexual,
 only he seeks the phallus through the machine
<BR>
--to become one with it and/or, according to the unconscious equation
of baby and phallus, to bear "a mechanical son" through it.

<P>
This imaginary self-castration is thus no ultimate sacrifice: it is a
fantasmatic achievement of a phallic ego in a state of perfect narcissism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Yet the rub here is that this binding does not allow for unbinding, for
 discharge of energy or release of aggression. Marinetti is left to seek
 this discharge in speed, war, and art, all of which he conceives in terms
 of ecstasy, ejaculation, or, more extremely, "autotomy," the term adopted
 by Sandor Ferenzci to describe when, in the release of sexual tension
 "on behalf of the entire organism," <I>the genital organ is ejected.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Marinetti calls this discharge "hygiene," which he associates equally
 with speed, war, and art, indeed with modernity in general. Like
 Lewis, who substitutes for the trope of speed the re of the vortex,
 Marinetti looks to these three events to suspend the tensions that plague
 him, especially the tension between binding and unbinding, defense and
 discharge. Thus, in "Let's Murder the Moonshine" , Marinetti
 writes of war: "It's our only hope, our reason for living, our only
 desire!" (<I>M,</I> 45). And in <I>War, the World's Only Hygiene,</I> he
 turns the old condemnation of war as murderous whore into a celebration
 of war as furious coitus: "See the furious coitus of war, gigantic
 vulva stirred by the friction of courage, shapeless vulva that spreads
 to offer itself to the terrific spasm of final victory!" (<I>M,</I>
 53-54). Yet what really is the object of desire here? It seems
 less the "shapeless vulva" than the soldier-subject as phallus--the
 body-psyche as narcissistic-aggressive weapon, autotomic projectile,
 "body in flames, like a fireship, against the enemy" (<I>M,</I> 46).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 This is the primary object of investment for Marinetti: an image of the
 body ego at once armored and aggressive, defended and discharged, that
 finds its "only hope [and] only desire" in war.

<P>
Here the question of violence in Marinetti must be addressed. No less than
his call for destruction, his disruption of language is performative:
it prepares for actual events. Yet "preparation" must be understood in
a double sense: not only an inciting

<B></B>

of violence but a shielding from it--an inciting that is also a
shielding. This process can be seen in terms of sexuality, and I doubt it
is "merely" an analogy. The violence pronounced in Marinetti is sadistic,
yet it is also masochistic, and primarily so: after all, who explodes in
his autotomic fantasies? In several recent texts Leo Bersani has defined
sexuality in terms of such a sublime self-shattering. "We desire what
nearly shatters us," he writes. "The mystery of sexuality is that we
seek not only to get rid of this shattering tension but also to repeat
it, even to increase it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 This is close to the dynamic in Marinetti: he desires such shattering,
 desires to repeat it, but also desires to be rid of it, to discharge
 it or at least to "sublimate" it. (Again: "Art is the need to destroy
 and scatter oneself" [<I>M,</I> 89].) For Bersani, violence arises when
 this desire is arrested, when its "psychic dislocations" are denied;
 then there develops "a destructive fixation on anecdotal violence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 At some level might the rhetorical violence of Futurism, its bombastic
 glorification of aggressive art, speed, and war, serve to stop this
 stoppage of desire, to embrace the disruption created by its movement
 in defense against the destruction provoked by its arrest?
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P>
Marinetti also conceives fascism along the lines of his phallic
fantasy. In "Beyond Communism"  he argues that "Futurist fascism"
supersedes both liberalism and bolshevism as the historical force of
revolution: it purifies and protects an Italy corrupted by bourgeois
parliamentarianism and threatened by communist bureaucracy. Here the
Futurist discourse of "hygiene" is overtly political, but its paradoxical
logic remains corporal and sexual: in order to make whole one must
amputate. "We Italian Futurists have amputated all the ideologies and
everywhere imposed our new conception of life, our formulas for spiritual
health" (<I>M,</I> 148).
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 For Marinetti it is not enough to unify Italy politically; it must be
 <I>totalized</I> ideologically, all heterogeneity effaced. And this
 totality is red in the phallic body amputated of all degenerate,
 divisive, that is, penile, elements.

<P>
In this image of the body, subject and nation are made to mirror one
another. With the trope of electricity as a nervous system, Marinetti
imagines his fellow nationals as fellow nerves: the fatherland is not only
"the greatest extension" of each but also the "single conration" that
"ties [them all] together" (<I>M,</I> 149). Technological apparatuses
that bind masses to party and leader replace political institutions
that once mediated subject and nation. "All that," Marinetti writes,
"in the great affectionate solidarity of our race on our peninsula
within the firm circle of boundaries conquered and deserved by our
great victory" (<I>M,</I> 153). Not only racial and ideological, this
binding is libidinal and imagistic: in the fascist peninsula the subject
is invited to find physical "boundaries," erotic "solidarity," phallic
"victory." And this totality, Marinetti warns, is not to be had otherwise:
"To deny the fatherland is the same as to isolate, castrate, shrink,
denigrate, or kill yourself" (<I>M,</I> 149).

<P><A NAME="4" HREF="4.2foster_4.html"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_4b.gif" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
In this way the aesthetic of the phallus is also a politics of the
fatherland in which the Italian peninsula is invoked as a libidinal image
for a new collective ego. But here, too, the image may be flawed, as the
etymology of the term "peninsula" suggests: <I>paene insula,</I> nearly
an island, nearly severed. This penis(ula) dangles dangerously

<B></B>

below the body of Europe, and Marinetti feels compelled to project it,
to phallicize it, to extend Italy to its linguistic limits, to recapture
its whole native body. In one words-in-freedom titled <I>Irredentismo</I>
Marinetti shows the peninsula thrust north and east into Austria with
Futurist lines, battle cries, and patron names (e. g., Mazzini): an
Italy in dissemination (<A HREF="4.2foster_4.html"> 4</A>). And yet a tension remains between the
demand for "the firm circle of boundaries," individual and national, and
a desire to exceed them. This tension is another instance of the double
logic of order and transgression, defense and discharge, armoring and
exploding, so pronounced in Marinetti, indeed in fascism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Here, too, war is the primary "resolution," psychic and political, that
 occurs to him: "war, the world's only hygiene."

<P>
But who is to mold the "flaccid human masses" into this "higher
spiritual elegance" (<I>M,</I> 154) of the fascist fatherland? For
Marinetti the answer is obvious: "We will have a race almost entirely
composed of artists" (<I>M,</I> 156). This race is the fatherland; "the
fatherland is nothing but a vast party" (<I>M,</I> 149); and the party
"will solve the social problem artistically" (<I>M,</I> 156). This
crossing of aesthetics and politics, of artistic purity and social
"hygiene," is ominous, especially when the language of spirituality is
also crossed with the technology of spectacle. And yet the party alone
is not adequate as a libidinal object to mold the flaccid masses (even
fascist trappings need a body to hang on). This role must be assumed by
the leader, as Marinetti implies in "Portrait of Mussolini" .

<P>
In this celebration Marinetti identifies Mussolini with Italy directly,
physically, "because physically he is built <I>all'italiana</I>"
(<I>M,</I> 158). "Carved out of the mighty rocks of our peninsula," his
"great gesture-fist-image-conviction" embodies "the cubic will of the
state" (<I>M,</I> 159). Of course Mussolini collaborated on this portrait
with a complete repertoire of phallic poses and dynamic expressions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Turgid torso, shaved head, a body like a "projectile": if Italy is a
 penis(ula), Mussolini is its (dick)head. And it is through this fetish
 of the body of the leader that the binding of individual to

<B></B>

party and fatherland is clinched. "A marvelous Futurist temperament,"
Mussolini is here made a marvelous Futurist art work as well.

In "Some Reflections on the Ego," a short text of 1953, Lacan writes
of <I>"Homo psychologicus"</I> as "the product of our industrial age,"
possessed of a strange intimacy with the machine. "It is almost as if
the two were actually conjoined," Lacan remarks. "Its mechanical defects
and breakdowns often parallel his neurotic symptoms. Its emotional
significance for him comes from the fact that it exteriorizes the
protective shell of his ego as well as the failure of his virility."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In Marinetti, virility is indeed assisted by a fantasmatic prosthesis of
 man and machine "conjoined," and yet the charade of phallic possession is
 doomed to failure, to "defects and breakdowns," especially volatile ones
 in his case. I want to turn now to the other aspect of this fantasmatic
 prosthesis, its use as "the protective shell" of the ego, as manifested
 in the early work of Wyndham Lewis. And here one may come to wonder,
 as Lacan did in general, whether it is "psychologically advantageous
 to have a strong ego."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P>
Like Marinetti, Lewis sketches the new ego in his earliest manifestos. The
inaugural issue of <I>Blast</I>  opens with a series of "blasts" and
"blesses," the first of which is typical: "BLAST First (from politeness)
ENGLAND / Curse its climate for its sins and infections / Dismal symbol,
set round our bodies, of effeminate lout within . . ." (<I>B,</I>
11). Several pages later Lewis opposes to this blasted England the
blessed image of an "industrial island machine, pyramidal workshop"
(<I>B,</I> 23-24). Like the Italian penisula for Marinetti, this
bounded British island, disciplined like a machine, hierarchical like a
workshop, is an ideal re for Lewis of a new collective ego. As in
Marinetti, nation and subject mirror one another in a body image, and
Lewis demands a hardening of the "effeminate lout within" each. In the
nation the lout is the masses; in the subject it is the unconscious,
the drives, sexuality. Each is feared as "feminine," a force of flux, a
threat to the masculinist stability of country and ego alike--a threat
that stems from the commutability of the two louts, of "the outside"
and "the inside." But whether the lout is the masses introjected or the
unconscious projected, it must be "hardened" in nation and subject alike.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 "Bless this hysterical wall," Lewis writes in <I>Blast</I>, "built round
 the ego" (<I>B,</I> 26). "Anything but yourself is dirt" (<I>B,</I> 70).

Like Marinetti, Lewis calls on artists to mold this flaccid feminine
modernity into an armored masculine modernism. For these cultural
"Caliphs" "a course of egotistic hardening . . . is required" (<I>B,</I>
134). Yet this hardening is only one part of the project; the other is
the blasting that Lewis performs with satiric abandon. Aesthetic and
political, these processes of discharge and defense are also psychic:
if Marinetti stresses the unbinding of energy and the blasting of
the subject, Lewis stresses the binding and the hardening. And this
difference informs the difference between the two movements: in image
and form Futurism favors the explosive, while Vorticism focuses on the
fixed. Thus Futurist motifs of the burst of energy and the gesture

<B></B>

forced free of the body, and Futurist lines as lines of force and traces
of speed, are both pledged to redefine form and to interpenetrate objects
temporally (<A HREF="4.2foster_5.html"> 5</A>). The Vorticist versions tend to the opposite--to
define form and to separate objects spatially (<A HREF="4.2foster_6.html"> 6</A>). "I hate the
movement that blurs lines," Lewis often remarked (once directly to
Marinetti [<I>BB,</I> 35]).

<P>
In fact Lewis opposes all such blurrings, whether associated with crowds
or women, the Freudian unconscious or the Bergsonian <I>dur&eacute;e</I>
(<I>Time and Western Man</I> [1927] is a long diatribe against
the temporal obsessions of modernist culture). This <I>fear</I>
of interpenetration is fundamental to his aesthetics, philosophy,
and politics, just as the <I>desire</I> for the same is basic to
Marinetti. And for both men the stake of these forms and phenomena is
the subject: while Marinetti strives for an ecstatic release of the body
ego, Lewis struggles to keep it intact and hard.

<P>
Faced with the tension between discharge and defense, the early Marinetti
seeks a momentary resolution in <I>speed,</I> while the early Lewis
pursues it in a related ideal, <I>the vortex.</I> "At the heart of the
whirlpool is a great silent place where all energy is concentrated," he
states. "And there, at the point of concentration, is the Vorticist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 This vortex is more than an image; at its "maximum point of energy
 when stillest," it is an apparatus that elicits and channels libidinal
 energies (<I>B,</I> 148).
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 For Lewis it res not only the tension between discharge and defense,
 blasting and hardening, but also the binding of stimulus-shock into
 protective shield, the conversion of energy into ego. In a sense it is
 a metaphor-machine of this conversion, as Ezra Pound suggests: "The
 vortex is the point of maximum energy. It represents, in mechanics,
 the greatest efficiency" (<I>B,</I> 153).

<P>
Lewis invests in such res of hardening because of his great fear,
before and after the war, of "nondifferentiation." This is the gist of
his antihumanism: he assumes

<B></B>

a separation not only from the divine and the natural but <I>from the
human.</I> More, he celebrates this separation, militates for culture to
reinforce it at all costs. Here again self-alienation is troped not only
as the preservation of the self but also as its supreme value. In <I>The
Art of Being Ruled,</I> Lewis attacks all forces of nondifferentiation,
especially the "sex transformation" in postwar society that feminizes men
and masculinizes women (the dreaded epitome of this nondifferentiation
is "male inversion"). Lewis condemns modernist art too as "a thirst to
sexually invade everything--to violate any intimity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 In <I>Time and Western Man</I> this attack on nondifferentiation turns
 philosophical. Here the great enemy of the armored ego is the Bergsonian
 flux, the obsession with the temporal and the psychological. For Lewis
 this modernist engulfment in time erodes the subject, but so does the
 modernist diffusion of space; the new ego and the fierce abstraction
 of Vorticism are arrayed against both invasions.

<P>
As Lewis rejects the flux thought by Bergson, he embraces the stasis
proposed by the art historian Wilhelm Worringer in <I>Abstraction and
Empathy</I> <I>(Abstraktion und Einf&uuml;hlung</I> [1907]). This
"psychology of style" was introduced into Vorticist circles by
T. E. Hulme, but it is a primary for Lewis as well. Worringer combines two
notions--empathy <I>(Einf&uuml;hlung)</I> derived from the psychologist
Theodor Lipps, and artistic volition <I>(Kunstwollen)</I> derived from
the art historian Alois Reigl--in order to relate artistic styles to
"psychic states."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Across history and culture, Worringer argues, there are two stylistic
 poles in art, naturalism and abstraction, that express two opposite
 relations to the world, an empathic engagement and a shocked withdrawal:

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Whereas the precondition for the urge to empathy is a happy pantheistic
relationship of confidence between man and the phenomena of the external
world, the urge to abstraction is the outcome of a great inner unrest
inspired in man by the phenomena of the outside world. . . . We might
describe this state as an immense spiritual dread of space. [<I>AE,</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
"Dominated by an immense need for tranquility," the primitive turned to
abstraction (<I>AE,</I> 16). Worringer sees a similar turn, also driven by
"inner unrest" and "spatial dread," in the modern: "slipped down from the
pride of knowledge, man is now just as lost and helpless" (<I>AE,</I>
18). As a consequence the modern artist also struggles to arrest and
separate, to abstract and preserve--an account quite different from the
usual celebrations of the mastery of the abstract artist, whether claimed
in terms technical or formal, historical or spiritual. Worringer undercuts
the proud humanism of all such readings. Like Marinetti and Lewis, he is
pushed toward the paradox that the very "impulse to self-preservation"
(<I>AE,</I> 35) has driven the modern toward the abstract and the
inorganic.

<P>
Lewis came to Worringer through Hulme. In January 1914, six months before
the first issue of <I>Blast,</I> Hulme delivered a lecture titled "Modern
Art and its Philosophy" that adapts <I>Abstraction and Empathy</I> toward
an advocacy of Vorticist art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 He divides modern styles into two categories, geometric and organic,
 which answer to opposite "necessities of the mind" and "attitudes
 towards the world" (<I>S,</I> 77-78). Organic styles, naturalist
 and empathic, express the humanist attitude dominant in art from the
 Renaissance through romanticism: a "flat and insipid optimism" (<I>S,</I>
 80) that places man at the center of nature. Thus for Hulme the return
 of geometric styles in modern art signals the return of the opposite
 attitude: "a feeling of separation in the face of outside nature"
 (<I>S,</I> 85). Like Lewis, Hulme celebrates this "original sin"; he
 too embraces it as an ultimate value.

<P>
Yet a problem arises in the Vorticist adaptation of Worringer: a
too-close association of the modern and "the primitive." Like Worringer
and Riegl, Hulme subscribes to a cultural evolutionism that is racialist
at base; here, for example, he cites Riegl: "In our scale of values,
[the geometric] occupies the lowest position" (<I>S,</I> 17).
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 Under this bias Hulme must qualify the return of this style in modern
 art. First, he argues that "the necessary presupposition" of abstraction
 is not "a condition of fear" but of "separation between man and nature"
 (<I>S,</I> 87). Second, he insists that Vorticist abstraction is modeled
 not on primitive art but on machinic "organisation," which is to say
 machinic <I>de</I>organicization, as this comment on Lewis suggests:
 "It is obvious that [his] only interest in the human body was in a few
 abstract mechanical relations perceived in it, the arm as lever and so
 on" (<I>S,</I> 106).

<P>
"What he said should be done, I <I>did</I>" (<I>BB,</I> 100), Lewis once
remarked of Hulme. But, again, it is Worringer who set the aesthetic
terms for both men, and both often echoed his enthusiasm for abstraction,
Assyrian, Egyptian, Byzantine, and so on. Already in an early text in
<I>Blast</I> Lewis reveals his ambition to adapt Worringer to a modern
conception of art and subjectivity. Titled "The New Egos," it reads as
a Worringerian

<B></B>

parable of two complementary res, "a civilized savage" and a "modern
town-dweller" (<I>B,</I> 141).
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Neither is "secure": the first lives in a "vagueness of space," the
 second amid crowds that "overlap, intersect, and are Siamese to any
 extent" (<I>B,</I> 141). Yet the savage has developed an art to quell
 his insecurity, an art of the re abstracted to a "simple black
 human bullet," whereas the modern only senses that "the old form of
 egotism is no longer fit for such conditions as now prevail, [that]
 the isolated human re of most ancient Art is an anachronism,
 [that] the actual human body becomes of less importance every day"
 (<I>B,</I> 141). There follows this Worringerian credo: "All clean,
 clear cut emotions depend on the element of strangeness, and surprise
 and primitive detachment. Dehumanization is the chief diagnostic of the
 Modern World" (<I>B,</I> 141). The chief diagnostic, it is also the chief
 remedy for Lewis: if the modern is to survive its own dehumanization,
 it must dehumanize further; it must take "strangeness, surprise, and
 primitive detachment" to the limit.

Lewis does not forego the human re. Even in his nonobjective works he
often abstracts from its gestures, as if to convert the re into its
own force field. Sometimes his abstraction <I>is</I> this conversion of
a re into a protective shield, "a simple human bullet." Yet usually
he is not content to show the mere result of this armoring; rather, he
evokes its struggle and its stake. Especially in the "designs" of the
early 1910s a great tension exists between re and surround, as if
the body ego, never secure, were caught between definition, about to
break free as an autonomous subject, and dispersal, about to be invaded
schizophrenically by space.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 In a typical suite based on <I>Timon of Athens</I> , the
 Shakespearean misanthrope is suspended between definition and dispersal
 in this way: as he struggles toward autonomy he becomes all the more
 imbricated in space (<A HREF="4.2foster_7.html"> 7</A>).

This tension is difficult to maintain, and especially in the early designs
Lewis stresses the binding of the body image. Sometimes this hardening
seems to come from without, outside in, as in <I>The Vorticist</I>
, in which the body is abstracted as if by the stimulus-shock of
the world (<A HREF="4.2foster_8.html"> 8</A>). Sometimes this hardening seems to come from within,
inside out, as in <I>Vorticist Design</I> (ca. 1914), in which the body
is abstracted as if by its internal drives (<A HREF="4.2foster_9.html"> 9</A>). In one concentrated
re, <I>The Enemy of the Stars</I> , these two hardenings
converge (<A HREF="4.2foster_0.html"> 10</A>). On the one hand,
with a head like a receiver, the re appears reified from without,
its skin turned into a shield; on the other hand, stripped of organs and
arms, it appears reified from within, its ossature turned into "a few
abstract mechanical relations." (In either case it looks the part of an
"enemy of the stars," resistant to all influence.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 After the war this hardening becomes all or nothing: in a near-literal
 return to the inorganic, some res of the 1920s appear petrified
 (this is true of many portraits as well), while others appear excoriated
 (in one drawing Lewis imagines the crucifixion as an excoriation, Christ
 flayed by space). Finally, in a few works of this period excoriation and
 petrification appear combined, as if the body were suddenly fossilized,
 then totemized.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P>
In many res Lewis registers dread or shock, but only to turn dread
into aggression, shock into protection--as if to convert any breaching
into an armoring that both shields and aggresses. This elaboration of
Worringer on abstraction toward Freud on the protective shield and the
death drive seems programmatic, yet the most relevant works predate
<I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I> (published in 1920, translated
into English in 1922), and his remarks on Freud thereafter are scant and
negative. Might Lewis have intimated this becoming-inorganic--of both the
protective shield that binds the body ego against stimulus-shock and the
death drive that releases the organism from all such tension--through
<I>Abstraction and Empathy?</I> There is no explicit evidence, but
Worringer does think abstraction in terms of such a drive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>

<P>
In <I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I> Freud formulates the death
drive in a famous passage: "If we are to take it as a truth that knows no
exception that everything living dies for <I>internal</I> reasons--becomes
inorganic once again--then we shall be compelled to say that 'the aim
of all life is death' and, looking backwards, that 'inanimate things
existed before living ones'" (<I>BPP,</I> 32). Thirteen years prior to
this statement, Worringer referred the <I>Kunstwollen</I> of abstraction
to a similar "morphological law"



that "still echoes like a dim memory in our human organism." And here he
conceives abstraction as a mimesis of this primal state of inorganicity:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A convinced evolutionist might . . . seek [geometrical form] in
the ultimate affinity between the morphological laws of organic and
inorganic nature. He would then erect the ideal postulate that the
morphological law of inorganic nature still echoes like a dim memory
in our human organism. He would then perhaps also assert further that
every differentiation of organised matter, every development of its most
primitive form, is accompanied by a tension, by a longing to revert to
this most primitive form. . . . Thus, in the contemplation of abstract
regularity man would be, as it were, delivered from this tension and at
rest from his differentiation in the enjoyment of his simplest formula,
of his ultimate morphological law. [<I>AE,</I> 35-36]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If Lewis does intimate this formulation, he does so in a paradoxical
way that inverts it, for he seeks to find in this <I>prehistory</I>
of a radical <I>non</I>differentiation a <I>posthistory</I>
that promises an absolute differentiation. That is to say, Lewis
seeks to turn this "ultimate morphological law" into a principle of
transcendental self-affirmation. Along the way the (masochistic) drive
to self-destruction at its core may also be turned into the (sadistic)
drive to master others--a drive abundantly manifest in Lewis the artist,
impresario, and man.

<P>
In his writings Lewis approaches the notions of the protective shield and
the death drive in several ways. First, he espouses a "primordialism"
more radical than any primitivism. "The artist goes back to the fish,"
he writes in <I>The Caliph's Design, </I> "to strike the fundamental
slime of creation" (<I>CD,</I> 65).
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 In "The Physiognomy of Our Time," also in this first collection of
 art essays, Lewis describes this condition as "Futuristic," as if the
 primordial were not only in our deepest past but in our modernist future
 as well. This intuition of a death drive as a process, even a goal within
 modernity has two ramifications. First, for Lewis as for Marinetti the
 old opposition of animate and inanimate is long since undone. On the
 one hand, Lewis writes in "The Physiognomy of Our Time," "every living
 form is a miraculous mechanism"; on the other hand, in a world become
 "inorganic" the machine has become an "organism" of its own (<I>CD,</I>
 77-78). Latent in the order of things ("the seagull is not far
 removed from the hydroplane" [<I>CD,</I> 73]), this mechanicity must now
 be articulated by the artist; in Worringerian fashion he must wrest this
 order out of chaos ("all our efforts indicate a desire . . . to order,
 regulate, disinfect and stabilise our life" [<I>CD,</I> 73-74]).

<P>
Second, with the organic and the inorganic thus forced into an identity
that is at once primordial and Futuristic, Lewis can present his
model of art in terms of a necessary evolution, even a biogenetic law:
"The creation of a work of art is an act of the same description as the
evolution of wings on the sides of a fish, the feathering of its fins; or
the invention of a weapon within the body of a hymenopter [e. g., an ant,
wasp, or bee] to enable it to meet the terrible needs of life" (<I>CD,</I>
65). This formulation suggests two further transvaluations. First, a
troping of Worringer on abstraction in which "primitive" dread before
nature becomes modern empathy with a second

<B></B>

nature, the machinic world ("we want to enjoy our consciousness, but to
enjoy it in all forms of life" [<I>CD,</I> 77]). Second, a troping of
Freud on the protective shield, the development of which art is not only
to recapitulate but, in an embrace of the machine, to accelerate--in order
"to meet the terrible needs of life."

<P>
Lewis also approaches the Freud of <I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</I> in
his concern with ectogenesis, or the process by which an organism extrudes
structures from its own surface. "The central nervous system originates
from the ectoderm," Freud writes of the protective shield. "The grey
matter of the cortex remains a derivative of the primitive superficial
layer of the organism." Under "the ceaseless impact of external stimuli,"
this ectoderm is "baked" into an inorganic "crust," which screens stimuli
for the layers beneath (<I>BPP,</I> 20-21). Compare Lewis in <I>The
Art of Being Ruled:</I> "We are <I>surface creatures</I>. . . . There
is no meaning except on the surface. It is physiologically the latest,
the ectodermic, and the most <I>exterior</I> material of our body that
is responsible for our intellectual life: it is on the faculty for
exteriorization that our life depends." (<I>WLA,</I> 210) In effect
Lewis adopts the Freudian metaphor of baking as a model for art and
subjectivity alike, but with two revisions: he reverses the process
(both must be baked inside out); and he insists that the baking be total,
the crust complete. For Lewis the internal layers that Freud wants to
protect are so much "jellyfish."

<P>
Even in his early writings--like the novel <I>Tarr</I>, the essays in
<I>The Caliph's Design,</I> or the short stories in <I>The Wild Body</I>
--Lewis takes this deadness as his ideal. Its most radical
formulation is presented by the eponymous protagonist of <I>Tarr:</I>

Deadness is the first condition of art. The armoured hide of the
hippopotamus, the shell of the tortoise, feathers and machinery, you
may put in one camp; naked pulsing and moving of the soft inside of
life--along with elasticity of movement and consciousness--that goes in
the opposite camp. Deadness is the first condition of art: the second is
absence of soul, in the human and sentimental sense. With the statue its
lines and masses are its soul, no restless inflammable ego is imagined
for its interior: it has <I>no inside:</I> good art must have no inside:
that is capital.

<P>
Already in play here in 1914 are all the leitmotifs of later Lewis: the
attack on psychological interiority as "naked pulsing"; the celebration of
the uncanny deadness of the armored, the machinic, even the neoclassical
(the statue); above all, the transformation of stimulus-shock into shield
(hide, shell, feathers, machinery).

<P><A HREF="4.2foster_2.html" NAME="2"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_2b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A><A HREF="4.2foster_1.html" NAME="1"><IMG SRC="button/4.2foster_1b.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
In part this celebration of deadness is cynical bravado, and it is
not often borne out by the work: Lewis may detest the naked pulsing
of life, but his res are not baked through. The early designs in
particular capture the tense ambiguity between inside and outside,
animate and inanimate, breaching and shielding that traumatic shock
puts into play. Aggression also enlivens the deadness otherwise prized
by Lewis. Consider his depiction of eyes: in Freud these organs are
"feelers . . . left behind on the surface" (<I>BPP,</I> 21); in Lewis
they are opaque objects, barred windows to no soul. Yet they are far
from dead: like the grins of his Tyros, the "elementals"

<B></B>

conjured up in the 1920s, the eyes for Lewis are forces of aggression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Even in more realistic portraits they appear as shields-cum-weapons,
 the point at which the body ego is most hardened, most cruel (. <A HREF="4.2foster_1.html">11</A>
 and <A HREF="4.2foster_2.html">12</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>

<P>
This aggression is also apparent in his commitment to satire, which
follows from his "externalist" approach. "There is a stiffening of Satire
in everything good, of 'the grotesque,' which is the same thing," Lewis
writes in his "Theory of the External, the Classical, Approach in Art"
. "The non-human outlook must be there . . . to correct our soft
conceit."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 Here the becoming-machinic of the body is not only a model of armoring
 but a means to expose <I>the inhuman</I> within the human. Lewis uses
 this trope, common in satire, to reduce the human to the physical in
 two related ways. First as a blind mechanism: "Men are sometimes so
 palpably machines, their machination is so transparent, that they are
 <I>comic,</I> as we say" (<I>MWA,</I> 95). And then, against our soft
 conceit, as a mere thing: "All men are necessarily comic: for they
 are all <I>things,</I> or physical bodies, behaving as <I>persons</I>"
 (<I>WB,</I> 158). Despite his anti-Bergsonism, Lewis is influenced here
 by the Bergson of <I>Le Rire</I> (1900 [Laughter]), who defines the
 comic in terms of the sudden exposure of a person as a mere mechanism:
 it is this degradation that is comic. Yet for Lewis a person is nothing
 but such a mechanistic thing; we are ridiculous only when we pretend
 to personhood.

<B></B>

<P>
Just as important to Lewis is the psychic economy of this comic effect,
and here he approaches Freud on humor (who was also influenced by Bergson,
as well as by Lipps). For Lewis the sudden exposure of the human as mere
mechanism is <I>satirical</I> because it mocks the humanist pretense
of free action: it reveals us as the "puppets" we are. But this sudden
exposure is <I>comic,</I> at least according to Freud, because the
mechanism thus revealed is the automatism of the instincts, and this
revelation eases instinctual tension; the comic is this release whereby
unpleasure is turned to pleasure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 Lewis writes of the comic object in similar terms: "We are astonished
 and shocked, and we bark at him--we <I>laugh</I>--in order to relieve
 our emotion" (<I>MWA,</I> 95). Note the atavism of this laughter: not
 only is the comic <I>object</I> instinctually automatic, but so is the
 comic <I>effect.</I> It too renders us a "wild body," that "supreme
 survival that is us, the stark apparatus with its set of mysterious
 spasms: the most profound of which is laughter" (<I>WB,</I> 157).
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>

<P>
For Lewis, then, we are comic because we are both automatic and reified,
puppets of blind instinct further reduced within modernity to the status
of mechanistic things. Such is the inhuman that he bids us to see as
comic. But to see it in this way is also to be screened from it: on the
one hand, the comedy "relieves emotion"; on the other hand, the satire
"stiffens" us. If Marinetti asks us to desire reification,

<B></B>

 Lewis invites us to laugh at it, and this comedy of reification is yet
 another troping of the destructive impulse in his work. Granted, this
 is but a turning, not a cancelling: his satire remains aggressive, his
 reduction of the human to the mechanistic is sadistic indeed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 This is true as well of his "stoical embrace" of "the brutality of
 mechanical life," or his sublimation of war into "romance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 Again and again Lewis works to turn these shocks, the "most dramatic
 of ailments" (<I>BB,</I> 115), into a new sublime, and here too he
 understands the transformation in terms of psychic economy: "For all life
 must in some way be pleasure--even . . . the horror of destruction or
 the 'narrow escape' from it--namely, the pleasures of the battlefield,
 or of any 'moving accidents'" (<I>WLA,</I> 212).
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 Sometimes, however, Lewis fails these transvaluations, and sometimes he
 does not attempt them at all--as if then the destructive impulse might
 be revealed as such, and he might enjoy the absolute pleasure of its
 complete expenditure. "Killing somebody must be the greatest pleasure
 in existence," he wrote as early as the first <I>Blast</I>. "Either
 like killing yourself without being interfered with by the instinct of
 self-preservation--or exterminating the instinct of self-preservation
 itself!" (<I>B,</I> 133).

<P>
Of course this is part swagger, but it is also part wager, and at one
point, in 1922, Lewis grasps the stake: "The game consists in seeing
how near you can get without the sudden extinction and neutralization
that awaits you as matter, or as the machine. In our bodies we have got
already so near to extinction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Could it be that this game is not the grim sideshow that it seems,
 that the moves of a Lewis or a Marinetti are not as aberrant as they
 appear? Could it be that the very stake of high modernism involves
 wagers such as these with reification and death? I see such res of
 reification and death approached and/or averted everywhere in European
 art of this time--not only in the dysfunctional automatons of dada and
 the dismembered mannequins of surrealism (what Lewis called "Hoffmann
 puppets"), but also in the machinic men of socialist constructivisms
 and the scarecrow-statues of fascistic neoclassicisms (what Lewis called
 "robot-men" and "living statues").
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 This is not to suggest some grand zeitgeist--that this period marches in
 lockstep to the death drive. But it is to hear, below the noisy appeals
 of the time, the various quests for the New Man as well as the various
 returns to the Old Humanism, the insistent call of the inhuman.

For both men the machine was an actual agent of bodily transformation and
a fantasmatic re of the same, and this uncertain status of position
and cause is part of its anxious attraction. On this uncertainty see
Victor Tausk, "On the Origins of Schizophrenia in the 'Influencing
Machine'" , <I>The Psychoanalytic Quarterly</I> 2 , essential
reading for the modernist imaginary of the machine.

<P>
There is renewed interest in Marinetti and Lewis (several books on
Lewis alone have appeared in the last few years), conditioned in
part by two general factors: the need to complicate the antitypal
opposition of modernism and fascism in visual culture, and the sense
that the metropolitan West is in the midst of qualitative technological
transformation.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT3" HREF="#REF3">3</A>.
This structural limitation may well be the ideological function of
this (or any) double logic. I point to other modernist and marxist
positions on technology below, but most remain with the double logic of
a fantasy of a Frankensteinian dismemberment of the body (pronounced in
<I>Capital</I>) versus a fantasy of its Futurist phallicization. In his
account of technology as both amputation and extension McLuhan expresses
this logic exactly. Not incidentally, McLuhan was inspired by Lewis: he
sought Lewis out in St. Louis in the early 1940s, published an essay
on his work in 1944, and founded a journal in homage to <I>Blast</I>
called <I>Counterblast.</I> What continuities regarding technological
shock, art, subjectivity, and politics might be found between "the new
ego" proposed by Lewis in <I>Blast</I> 1 and "the extensions of man"
traced by McLuhan in <I>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</I>
 (Wyndham Lewis, <I>Blast</I> 1 [20 June 1914; Santa Rosa: Black
Sparrow Press, 1981], 141; hereafter abbreviated <I>B</I>)?

In this modernist imagery might the machinic be the fundamental
re and <I>the body</I> the prosthetic? In his "Mirror Stage" paper
(1936-49) Lacan does describe the body-ego image as "automaton" and
"statue"--res uncannily similar to the machinic and neoclassical
spectres of the 1920s that also ambiguate between the intact and the
fragmentary (Jacques Lacan, "The Mirror Stage," in <I>&Eacute;crits,</I>
trans. Alan Sheridan [New York: W. W. Norton, 1977], 2-3;
hereafter abbreviated <I>E</I>). On related issues see my "Armor Fou"
(<I>October</I> 56 [spring 1991]) and my "Postmodernism in Parallax."

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT5" HREF="#REF5">5</A>.
I return to this paradox below. Neoclassicism and machinism cannot
be opposed as whole to fragment in European art of the 1920s. Often
machinic res are armored, made whole, while neoclassical ones
are broken into bits ("scarecrow[s]," as Adorno once remarked of
the neoclassicism of Igor Stravinsky, "damaged and disempowered by
a patched-up arrangement of dreams" [Theodor Adorno, <I>Musikalische
Schriften</I> vols. 1-3, ed. Rolf Tiedemann (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp
Verlag, 1978), 391]). And sometimes the machinic and the neoclassical are
combined, and not just in fascist art (e. g., Mario Sironi); underneath
the machinic veneer of a L&eacute;ger or a Le Corbusier there often lies
a neoclassical measure. In his caustic way Lewis captured the convergence
of these uncanny tendencies as so many symptoms of reification: "That
is what is afoot," he wrote in a 1934 text titled "Power-Feeling and
Machine-Age Art," "the <I>living</I> statue--which comes upon the
scene hand-in-hand with the robot-man--the herd of machine-minders
mingling, without recognition of a difference, with the herd of Hoffman
[<I>sic</I>] puppets" (Wyndham Lewis, "Power-Feeling and Machine-Age
Art," <I>Time and Tide</I> [October 1934]; reprinted in <I>Wyndham
Lewis on Art,</I> ed. Walter Michel and C. J. Fox [New York: Funk and
Wagnalls, 1969], 287). Note the ambiguity, typical of Lewis, between
the individual-as-mass and the mass-as-person.

These futures differed from regime to regime, as did the subjects
interpellated by them; and different styles were developed accordingly. In
this regard, Futurist technophilia is especially overdetermined:
part masculinist fantasy, part political allegory, it is also driven
by technological underdevelopment. The Vorticist situation is quite
different. "We've had machines here in England for a donkey's years,"
Lewis once told Marinetti. "They're no novelty to <I>us</I>" (Wyndham
Lewis, <I>Blasting and Bombardiering</I> [1937; London: Calder and
Boyars, 1967], 34; hereafter abbreviated <I>BB</I>). Here I focus on the
machine as fantasy, which is its privileged role in modernism, even when
it res "objectivity."

I refer to the Lacanian <I>corps morcel&eacute;</I> that haunts the ego
once it has cathected its own ral integrity--haunts it as its own

in Parallax" I suggested that this Lacanian formulation encrypts a fascist
male subject, but this may be to generalize this subject as the subject

As is well known, Marinetti was an early collaborator of Mussolini, Lewis
a sometime admirer of Hitler. Like many of the wartime generation, both
were influenced by Georges Sorel, particularly his <I>Reflections on
Violence</I> , a text of enormous influence on emergent fascisms
(it was first translated into English by T. E. Hulme, a Vorticist
associate). In fact, Futurism and Vorticism constitute an avant-garde
best described as Sorelian: both partake of the "general strike," of
the imperative to mythologize events and to activate images, especially
of violence. Lewis discusses Sorel in <I>The Art of Being Ruled</I>
, and the program of his 1937 autobiography, <I>Blasting and
Bombardiering,</I> is pure Sorel: "I have set out to show how war, art,
civil war, strikes and coup d'&eacute;tats dovetail into each other"

Marinetti, old Italy, especially Venice, is cloacal in another way. In
a sense, he evokes such historical stages, individual and national, in
order to break with them, to allow a Futurist identity to emerge from
them. In "Against Past-Loving Venice," a leaflet dropped from the Clock
Tower in Venice on 8 July 1910, Marinetti writes: "We renounce the old
Venice . . . <I>cloaca maxima</I> of pass&eacute;ism. We want to cure
and heal this putrefying city, magnificent sore from the past. . . . We
want to prepare the birth of an industrial and military Venice. . . . Let

As in this fantasy-memory of a factory beach in "Tactilism" : "I
was naked in a sea of flexible steel that breathed with a virile, fecund
breath. I was drinking from a sea-chalice brimming with genius as far
as the rim. With its long searing flames, the sun was vulcanizing my
body" (<I>M,</I> 110). It is as if Marinetti secretly identified with
Vulcan as a crippled (castrated) god who imaginatively forges perfect
(phallic) bodies. This "vulcanizing" is also evocative of the Freudian
"baking" of the epidermis into the "protective shield" (more on this
below). It is a persistent trope in fascistic visions of the subject

have become a symbol of the earth that we ought to abandon" (<I>M,</I>

desire for it, which confuses the sexual positioning of these two lovers

Here Marinetti turns into a triumph the "consolation" offered the hero
stiffened by terror before the castrative Medusa: the good news is that
"he is still in possession of a penis"; the bad is that he is turned to
stone (Sigmund Freud, "Medusa's Head" [1922], in <I>Sexuality and the
Psychology of Love,</I> ed. Philip Rieff [New York: MacMillan, 1963],
212-13). For a provocative argument concerning the corollary of the
position presented here--that "self-preservation, in its capitalist

In Japan they carry on the strangest of trades: the sale of coal made
from human bones. All their powderworks are engaged in producing a new
explosive substance, more lethal than any yet known. This terrible new
mixture has as its principal element coal made from human bones with
the property of violently absorbing gases and liquids. For this reason
countless Japanese merchants are thoroughly exploring the corpse-stuffed

of castration is this transsexual that (s)he undergoes it to be free of
it, only "through surgery to realize that castration is an evil without

Like the Freudian notion of a protective shield, the Ferenzcian idea of
a "Thalassal regression" to an oceanic womb may have more to say about
male fantasy than biological science. And it is not incommensurate with
technological motifs, as suggested here by the interwar German philosopher
Adrien Turel: "This technical prosthetic system, which is a typically

Or is this notion of prophylaxis too readily turned into a justification
for any such representation of violence? As we will see, Vorticism seeks
this stoppage in order to preserve the ego from such disruption, and
in so doing may risk the greater violence. On the other hand, Lewis is
also concerned with "blasting," and his satire may function as bombast
does in Marinetti--as a partial release.

Yet here again is a rub: with his "square crashing jaws" and "scornful
jutting lips" (<I>M,</I> 158), Mussolini projects the other, castrative
aspect of the fetish as well. ("Paradoxical as it may seem, the Fascist
phallus is, like Freud's Medusa, at once hyperphallic and castrating"
[Schnapp, "Heads of State," 27].) Productive of fear, anxiety, resentment,
was this castrative aspect "castrated" in turn in the mutilated body of
the hanged Mussolini?

<P>
Mussolini dropped Marinetti when he was no longer useful, but his imaging
of Mussolini remained important. Today it might be explored along the
lines of the body politics examined by Claude Lefort in <I>L'Invention
democratique</I> (Paris: Fayard, 1981; English translation in <I>The
Political Forms of Modern Society,</I> ed. John B. Thompson [Cambridge,
Mass.: MIT Press, 1986]; hereafter abbreviated <I>PF</I>). For Lefort
there are three paradigmatic stages of the libidinal relation of
subjects to leaders in the modern West. The first is the king of the
ancien r&eacute;gime held to possess a double body, at once mortal
and immortal, patterned after the double body of Christ (here Lefort
draws on the classic study by Ernst Kantorowicz, <I>The King's Two
Bodies</I> [1957]). The kingdom is also conceived as a body that
the king both images (in the familiar synecdoche "I am France") and
directs as its head. Thus when the democratic revolution decapitates
the king, it also decapitates its own body politic, and its imaginary
coherence begins to fall apart. "Power appears as an empty place," Lefort
writes. "Unity cannot now efface social division" (<I>PF,</I> 303). For
Lefort totalitarianism emerges as a belated "attempt to resolve [the]
paradoxes" of this empty place of power. The metaphorics of the double
body is resurrected by the re of "the egocrat," who guarantees "the
representation of the People-as-One." But the representation depends on
two things: "the integrity of the body" and "the incessant production
of enemies" (<I>PF,</I> 298-99).

<P>
How different is the "Futurist fascism" red by Marinetti? It, too,
reinstates the double body of leader and nation in an imaginary coherence
of the two. It, too, sees democracy as an empty place of power, and
it, too, requires enemies of the state within and without. And in both
regimes the machine is used as an image of social organization. And yet
there are also crucial differences. For example, in "Futurist fascism" the
machine is not productivist and proletarian (a distinction must be drawn,
as Schnapp suggests in "<I>18 BL,"</I> between <I>mechanization</I> as
a re of the subject in functional mesh with the social factory,
and <I>metallization</I> as a re of the subject in imaginary
identification with the military nation), and the fascist leader is
not an egocrat to identify with but a "phallocrat" to bind with. (In
this regard a further contrast can be made between the body politics of
Mussolini and Hitler.) For more recent meditations on the despot body
and the mass subject, see Kenneth Dean and Brian Massumi, <I>First and
Last Emperors</I> (New York: Autonomedia, 1992), and Michael Warner, "The

This association of the crowd and the unconscious as "feminine" threats
runs throughout Lewis, as it does in crowd discourse from Le Bon through
Freud. Lewis is more ambivalent about the crowd, for it can serve as a
site of "mobilization." In <I>Blasting and Bombardiering</I> he recalls
the wartime crowds: "So periodically we shed our individual skin, or
are apt to, and are purged in big being. An empty throb. . . . Does
not the Crowd in life spell death? . . . The Crowd is an immense
anaesthetic towards death, such is its immemorial function" (<I>BB,</I>
79-80). This "death" that is an "anaesthetic towards death" is
fundamental to Lewis on art and subjectivity.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT55" HREF="#REF55">55</A>.
Note the suggestion of pollution here, and the operation of abjection. If
in Marinetti the new ego is a man-machine that emerges from feminine
waters, in Lewis it is a "hysterical wall" set up against the same. Both
draw on the unconscious symbolism of the masculinist ego noted by Lacan
in the "Mirror Stage": "the formation of the <I>I</I> is symbolized
in dreams by a fortress, or a stadium--its inner arena and enclosure,
surrounded by marshes and rubbish-tips, dividing it into two opposed
fields of contest where the subject flounders" (<I>E,</I> 5). This
symbolism suggests a fairytale of patriarchy, an almost phylogenetic
feudalism inscribed in the structure of Western masculinity.

Wyndham Lewis, quoted in Douglas Goldring, <I>South Lodge</I> (London:

close enough to this point to miss it entirely. Ezra Pound: "Futurism
is the disgorging spray of a vortex with no drive behind it, dispersal"
(<I>B,</I> 153). Art history also tends to miss the difference between
the movements on this point.

Wilhelm Worringer, <I>Abstraction and Empathy,</I> trans. Michael Bullock
(New York: International Universities Press, 1953), 13; hereafter
abbreviated <I>AE.</I> This text is often discussed in relation to
expressionism, but Vorticism answered to the Worringerian will to
abstraction more radically (expressionism is empathic in comparison). This
also points to another difference between Vorticism and Futurism. The
notion of empathy may have passed into Futurism through Benedetto Croce
(who discusses Lipps in his <I>Aesthetics</I> [1909]); in any case an
"empathic" eclipse of distance between subject and object is fundamental
to Futurism. This is one reason why Lewis refers Futurism to impressionism
and dismisses both as realisms.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT60" HREF="#REF60">60</A>.
For Worringer the "intermediate stage" between the two poles, which
resolves them in an ideal form, is the "Northern artistic volition,"
especially as manifest in German Gothic, which resonated at the time with
German expressionism. This art history according to "race psychology"
(see note 62) brought Worringer close to Nazism.

See Thomas Ernest Hulme, <I>Speculations</I> (1924; London: Routledge
and Kegan Paul, 1987), 75-109; hereafter abbreviated <I>S.</I> Its
epigraph is pure Worringer: "The fright of the mind before the unknown
created not only the first gods, but also the first art."

<P>
A crucial medium of ideas for Vorticist circles, Hulme was first
influenced by Bergson; he then translated Sorel <I>(Reflections on
Violence);</I> and upon meeting Worringer in Berlin he embraced his
philosophy of art. Like several Vorticists and Futurists, Hulme died
in the war he had welcomed. In <I>Blasting and Bombardiering</I> Lewis
recounts a tempestuous relationship complicated by the fact that Hulme
preferred the work of Jacob Epstein.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT62" HREF="#REF62">62</A>.
The Worringerian model is informed by a developmental logic that
ranks cultures according to a racialist hierarchy. Residual in the
discipline of art history as developed in the late nineteenth century,
this racialism was pronounced in Lewis. But it did not contradict his
primitivism. However opposed to the modernist cult of "the primitive," he
insisted that "the Art-instinct is permanently primitive" (<I>B,</I> 33).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT63" HREF="#REF63">63</A>.
Lewis strove to combine these two res in his own protoganists and
personae. "We are Primitive Mercenaries in the modern world," he wrote
in <I>Blast</I> 1 (<I>B,</I> 30). And T. S. Eliot once commented that
in Lewis "we recognize the thought of the modern man and the energy of
the cave-man" (T. S. Eliot, review of <I>Tarr,</I> by Wyndham Lewis,
<I>Egoist</I> [September 1918]: 106).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT64" HREF="#REF64">64</A>.
The cubist imbrication of re and ground, to which the Vorticist
version is often related, does not register in this psychic way at
all. Jameson locates "the inner logic of [Lewis's] stylistic practice"
in a related tension between the sheer energy of his sentences and the
violent closure of his narratives (Jameson, <I>Fables of Aggression,</I>
30).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT65" HREF="#REF65">65</A>.
This effect corresponds to the reading of the play by Pound: "the fury of
intelligence baffled and shut in by circumjacent stupidity" (Ezra Pound,
"Vorticism," <I>Fortnightly Review</I> [1 September 1914]: 470). And this
reading in turn suggests that "the spatial" can serve as an abstraction
for "the social," as it sometimes does in Lewis.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT66" HREF="#REF66">66</A>.
In a short play of the same title in <I>Blast,</I> Lewis writes apropos
of "personality": "It is the one piece of property all communities have
agreed it is illegal to possess. . . . When mankind cannot overcome
a personality, it has an immemorial way out of the difficulty. It
becomes it. It imitates and assimilates that Ego until it is no longer
one. . . . This is success" (<I>B,</I> 66).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT67" HREF="#REF67">67</A>.
This becoming-inorganic is paralleled in the early work of Max Ernst,
who seems to respond to a similar drive in a different way. Like other
dadaists and surrealists, Ernst played with another form of hardening also
developed in Lewis--a becoming-insect of the body. But he did so in a way
that inverts its use there: first to mock the becoming-machine of man,
and second to explore the imbrication of death in sexuality (thus the
significance of the surrealist motif of the praying mantis, the female
of which kills the male in mating). The classic texts in the surrealist
milieu are by Roger Callois: "La Mante religieuse," <I>Minotaure</I>
5 (February 1934), and "Mim&eacute;tisme et psychasth&eacute;nie
l&eacute;gendaire," <I>Minotaure</I> 7 (June 1935). The convulsive
possession of the subject by space theorized by Caillois is precisely
what Lewis feared.

<P>
Lewis was fascinated by insects (his library contained an annotated
copy of <I>Ants, Bees, and Wasps</I> by John Lubbock), which he often
used, like machines, to re his ideal of aggressive armoring. In
"The Artist Older Than the Fish," he glosses an account by J. H. Fabre,
a French entomologist for whom all action was driven by instinct:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Fabre describes the creative capabilities of certain beetles, realizable
on their own bodies; beasts with a record capacity for turning their
form and colour impulses into living flesh. These beetles can convert
their faces into hideously carved and detestable masks, can grow
out of their bodies menacing spikes, and throw up on top of their
heads sinister headdresses, overnight. Such changes in their personal
appearance, conceived to work on the psychology of their adversaries,
is possibly not a very profound or useful invention, but it is surely
a considerable feat. Any art worth the name is, at the least, a feast
of this decription. The New Guinea barred and whitewashed masks are an
obvious parallel [note this last association with "primitive" abstraction]
[Wyndham Lewis, <I>The Caliph's Design</I> , ed. Paul Edwards (Santa
Barbara: Black Sparrow Press, 1989), 66; hereafter abbreviated <I>CD</I>].

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT68" HREF="#REF68">68</A>.
Among other commonalities, Worringer and Freud shared a
psychophysiological model of development, and both were driven by an
epistemological mandate to correlate new discourses--here art history
and psychoanalysis--with the principles of biology and/or physics. (In
this regard the primary reference for Freud was Fechner; for Worringer
it was Lotze.)

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT69" HREF="#REF69">69</A>.
In the same period Lewis writes of his fiction similarly: "Upwards
from the surface of existence a lurid and dramatic scum oozes and
accumulates into the characters we see" (Wyndham Lewis, "Inferior
Religions" [1917-27], in <I>The Complete Wild Body,</I> ed. Bernard
Lafourcade [Santa Barbara: Black Sparrow Press, 1982], 152; hereafter
abbreviated <I>WB</I>). As "expressions of the conservative nature of
living substance," Freud notes the return of certain fish to spawn, the
migration of certain birds, and the recapitulation inscribed in embryology
(<I>BPP,</I> 30-31).

Lewis defines the Tyro as "an elementary person; an elemental, in short"
(Wyndham Lewis, <I>Tyros and Portraits</I> [Leicester Galleries, April

"brandish their appetites in their faces" (<I>WB,</I> 354).

In a private note Hulme all but images the eye as the point at which
the death drive is driven home: "The eyes, the beauty of the world, have
been organised out of faeces. Man returns to dust. So does the face of
the world to primeval cinders" (<I>S,</I> 227). What irony is there that
Lewis went blind?

is explicit enough (<I>Wyndham Lewis on Art,</I> ed. Michel and Fox,

say that the sadist sets out to substitute for the human organism the
image of machinery" (<I>Passagen-Werk,</I> ed. Rolf Tiedemann [Frankfurt:

As for the first transvaluation: "[Vorticism] was not an asylum from the
brutality of mechanical life. On the contrary it identified itself with
the brutality, in a stoical embrace" (Wyndham Lewis, <I>Wyndham Lewis

Laidlaw, 1939], 78). As for the second:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
When <I>on joue sa vie,</I> it is not so much the grandeur of the
spectacle of destruction, or the chivalrous splendour of the appointments,
as the agitation in the mental field within, of the organism marked down
to be destroyed, that is impressive. It is that that produces "the light
that never was on land or sea," which we describe as "romance." Anything
upon which that coloration falls is at once transred. And the source
of light is within your own belly [<I>BB,</I> 115].

This "narrow escape" is one definition of the sublime. For his part
Marinetti seeks not to sublimate shock into the sublime but to arrest it
there. Thus in a letter to Severini from the front (20 November 1914):
"I believe . . . that the greatest war, lived with intensity by Futurist
painters, can produce real convulsions in their sensibility and spur them
towards a brutal simplification of very clear lines such as to strike and
incite the reader in the same way that battles strike and incite" (quoted

I first climbed the steps from the street near Notting Hill Gate in
mid-November 1956. Every evening thereafter until I left London about
a week later I would climb it again; Wyndham Lewis was especially glad
of an evening visitor, after his day of writing.

<P>
Writing? Not painting, because he'd been blind for five years. "Milton
had his daughters," he'd announced back then; "I have my dictaphone." But
it was literally <I>writing</I> that he'd soon returned to. In the blue
armchair from which he dominated the flat's major room, on a huge pad of
paper, pen in hand, he wrote. His technique was to clutch the top of the
pad's left side with his left hand, then, starting three fingers' width
down, to write until his ballpoint bumped off the right edge. Back to
the left, come down three fingers, and repeat. That way he got perhaps
five lines on a page, so widely spaced that, waver though they might,
they were unlikely to intersect. The page completed, he tore it off and
dropped it face down on the floor to his left. His wife Froanna (from
"Frau Anna"; she'd been christened Anne) would gather up the day's work
for typing. That was how seven books got produced. (Some odd repetitions
have been noticed in <I>The Human Age.</I> They survived because reading
the entire final typescript back to the author took much longer than it
would have taken him to read it by himself. Inevitably, he now and then
forgot he'd "already said that.")

<P>
On my second or third visit, November 18th, a Sunday, his seventy-fourth
birthday was celebrated by the three of us. Life being "too short to
travel first class," there was champagne and pheasant, rather for us
two than for him. Offered more


 champagne, <B></B> he shouted "NO!!!" so sharply Froanna felt moved to
 venture, "You mustn't mind Wyndham shouting. It's just . . . High
 Spirits!" Actually it was blindness, by which, late in life, he'd been
 deprived of something most of us don't realize we depend on vision for:
 a knowledge of how far away are the people we're talking to. Geoffrey
 Bridson, of the BBC, told me of a lunch in a mid-London oyster house,
 where the blind Lewis imparted confidences in a voice audible "as far
 as Piccadilly Circus."

<P>
His own work seemed to him thin and remote. He chanced to mention
<I>Time and Western Man:</I> "That's a book of mine." Mainly, I'd give
him things to respond to. I'd flown from America. "Were the hostesses
pretty?" I described the dilemma of a young British poet I'd recently met,
wondering if he should visit America. "Tell him <I>by all means</I> to go
to America." (I did, and he did; it was sound advice.) I'd lunched with
Eliot, who'd given me the address of a tailor on Albemarle Street. "That's
an expensive street." His most memorable riposte followed my recital of
Eliot's performance before a succession of cheeses: a native American's
parody of British connoisseurship, done for an overseas visitor whom
he'd typecast as Huck Finn. I've described it in <I>The Pound Era;</I>
here I'll just repeat Lewis's response: "Oh, never mind <I>him.</I> He's
like that with everybody. But he doesn't come <I>in here</I> disguised
as Westminster Abbey."

<P>
"In here" was the terrain the blind man commanded, a flat doomed for
razing any day, to make room for a deluxe tube station. Lewis claimed to
have staved that off during his lifetime by adroitly planted newspaper
interviews. Four months after our last talk he was dead. His last words
are said to have been "Mind your own business," in response to a nurse's
query about his bowels.

<P>
All through the doomed flat, bell pushes had been disconnected. Wires
hung loose above nameplates that threatened to fall. On my last day,
I removed one that hung aslant from a single screw. It says simply,
"Wyndham Lewis. Studio A." Better with me, I thought, in the land of
America and Cosmic Man, than in some London rubbish-bin. I'm sure Lewis
would have agreed.

<B>Introduction</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
<I>The text is taken from a four-page carbon typescript at Cornell. It
is annotated at the opening by Lewis: </I>"IMPORTANT NOTE"<I> and "for
explanation</I> | <I>Tyro." This suggests that the piece was composed in
the early 1920s and belongs to the group of essays concerned with the
aesthetics of visual art that Lewis published during this period. The
mention of </I>The Tyro<I> relates it to the "Essay on the Objective of
Plastic Art in Our Time" published in issue number two . This was
an unfinished essay, and both "The Anonymity of Perfection" and some more
fragmentary notes at Cornell entitled "A Theory of Divine Imperfection"
may have been intended as developments of its argument. In the "Essay
on the Objective of Plastic Art in Our Time," Lewis discusses the
imperfection of men of genius in comparison with an absolute standard. A
synthesis of several geniuses (Calderrf, Voltaire, Plotinus) might seem
to approach this standard more closely, but would lack identity and be a
"pale shadow of their separate selves. Perfection, therefore, from this
standpoint, appears as a Platonic ideal, and is a thing with which we
have not very much to do. . . . "</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<I> But, despite its title, "The Anonymity of Perfection" as it stands
does not develop this line of thought (perhaps because the typescript
may only be the first section of a longer or unfinished essay, since it
is numbered as section "I"). What we have of the essay is more closely
related, first, to </I>

<B></B>

<I>a section of the "Essay on the Objective of Plastic Art in Our
Time" called "The Sense of the Future" advocating detachment from
the functionalism of everyday life (and criticizing Futurism for its
attachment to the machine of the present); and, second, the essay, "The
Meaning of the Wild Body," published in </I>The Wild Body<I> in 1927,
but probably extracted from "Man of the World" typescripts composed in
the early 1920s. That essay shows a similar preoccupation with dualism
and the fundamental absurdity or uncanniness of animal life.</I>

<P>
<I>This essay and the two that follow are published in "reading"
versions. Minor errors of spelling, typing, and punctuation have been
silently corrected, but the texts have not been brought into close
conformity with modern style. Significant alterations and doubtful
readings are recorded in the editorial notes to each essay.</I>

<P>
That we are eternal miners, lashed in the clumsy process of learning
by the retribution that awaits our mistakes, and dreaming, steeped in
transcendental values that transform the mechanical basis of our life into
a fairyland, is the first truth that we must accept. "I do not know what
I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a
boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding
a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great
ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me," Sir Isaac Newton wrote.

<P>
So Newton felt that he had been "only like a boy playing on the seashore,
and diverting himself"!

<P>
He at least was not taken in by the scale of the immense machine of the
universe that he had constructed. He was a great mechanic. But he knew
that this machine was only in reality a toy, just as a motor-car or a
flying machine is a toy, invented by an eager and ingenious child. The
only difference was that his toy was a very big one though not much more
complicated than many machines invented by man. It would rather be some
grand aesthetic or emotional twist of temperament that would lead this
great mechanic to make railways or world-ways for stars rather than more
homely contrivances on the face of the earth for our domestic uses.

<P>
Where we say a "child" and a "toy," again, or "work" or "play," it is
necessary not to leave it at that.

<P>
The analogy is this. The little boy makes a wooden sword. It is
an actor's property, really: it only <I>resembles</I> the weapons of
the real world. Or the little girl has a bevy of dolls. They are only
simulacra of life, worked, when their eyes are constructed to close in
sleep, by an interior mechanism.

<P>
What ultimately is the difference between a "toy" and a "machine" (for we
do not call a machine that serves as a toy or plaything a machine)? The
difference is that the toy is a make-believe only, a small and incomplete
model of a larger mature thing of

<B></B>

the same stamp. The <I>real</I> thing (fire-engine, for instance, or
six-inch gun) extinguishes real life-size fires, or kills people, whereas
the child's imitation fire-engine or gun, however elaborate an imitation,
is not adapted to play a part in LIFE, but only in the imitative life
of the child's fancy.

<P>
But what is the nature of the "reality" of the real fire-engine and
guns? Are people really <I>killed,</I> in the full na&iuml;f acceptance
of the simple unspeculative mind, and does <I>so much</I> depend on
the spectacular galloping of the fire-engine? Is not the thrill, as the
hoof-beats echo in our brain, an aesthetic one; horror and ecstasy, and
the contents of the Chamber of Horrors of the mind, a representation,
and not a reality? Would men be so ready, would they be <I>able</I>
even, to indulge in huge butcheries, like a modern war, would they be
able to go about their rash, ordinary existence so calmly, if they were
not intimately convinced of the superficiality or "nonentity," of the
events in which they were called on to "play their part" as they say?

<P>
In maturity a sense of the same unreality haunts the child, transformed
by some to him strange enchantment into a large full-sized "mammal," as
he finds he is labelled.

<P>
Or when puberty arrives for the girl-child, and she finds a mate, the
anonymous array of her cells, working certainly under her conscious
orders, but obeying some "instinct" that is in a sense foreign to her,
produces a living doll, which she nurses and cherishes. This new doll,
however, is not made of wax but of protoplasm, and is part of the arch
mystery of quickening matter that surrounds her. It develops into a being
like herself, but in its turn becomes strange as it grows. It grows away
from her, leaving her behind. It is not, she perceives, <I>herself,</I>
but some separate enigma, which she cannot possess as she could direct and
own a wax doll. She has become part of the exterior world in a sense; and
as this new being grows, she fades and takes the road to extinction. To
some extent she sees her personality, in the form of the child, becoming
eaten up by the great life exterior to her, or being adulterated with
other foreign elements, of matter and destiny, under her eyes.

<P>
She is confronted, in most cases very obscurely, with one of the academic
riddles of philosophy: namely HOW CAN ONE THING CHANGE OR GROW OUT OF
ANOTHER THING?
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P>
When again she has said "this is me," and "that is not me," she has
included in a sense those cells of which "she" is composed, and which
in their unconscious fury of creation are obsessed by some despotic
order the motives of which she is ignorant, and from which a portion of
"her" appears to be detached. This, then, is the <I>self</I> that is
an irreducible factor of personal consciousness, like the ultimate atom
of Democritus?

<P>
The average mother, if we can imagine her getting as far as this by some
confused emotional road, will be prepared to call a halt at this stage
in the process of perplexity.

<P>
But, if she reflected on it, she would on the one hand feel that these
active and arbitrary cells (<I>her</I> cells, all said and done, more than
any other individual's) which had been the motive of all the pleasant,
half-pleasant, and disagreeable accidents of

<B></B>

her life, were implicated with her personality. That if they, and all
the rest of the evidently mechanical history of her life were withdrawn,
there would be very little left of HER! And on the other hand it could be
shown her how her personality, that she had traced, we have imagined, to
a hard and irreducible particle like a Democritan atom, must share the
fate of other irreducible atoms, and that the ineffable SHE must fade
out, evaporate, escape to at least a human extinction that way as well.

<P>
At this point (by which time she would no doubt be a little hysterical),
you could probably persuade her of the truth of Samuel Butler's remark:
that we were all actually only offshoots of the OVUM: that our arms,
legs, head and the rest of us, sprouted up like a plant, merely, from
this anonymous root, and all our complex activities referred to it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
But men and women think that it is in the interest of this real or
imaginary SELF that they are following the behests of their mechanism,
whether as it happens pleasant or the reverse. Just as a man who slaves
in some machine-like daily task identifies the interest of his dear
SELF with the machine he finds himself in, but never entirely surrenders
it. His dearest possession is still his latent "independence."

<P>
This ideal PERSONALITY, this EINZIGE, is the mind and ally of the OVUM
and with it the master-fact of our world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 It might be regarded as the master-stroke of the illusionistic mechanism,
 the bait and prize, whereby the entire concern is driven.

<P>
But in any case it is by virtue of this PERSONALITY that we are
children. The more Personality we possess, the more child-like we
are: that is to say also more removed from the besetting reality, less
implicated in its queer anonymous proceedings. Life is a sleep, and a rest
from God. But the nightmares and reflections of his energy disturb and
terrorize that sleep. --We are "children" with a very anxious, troubled
childhood indeed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
So we do not share in the "work" of the world, or at least we do not know
that we participate in its results and benefits: we only invent Heavens
and Utopias for ourselves to cheer us at our drudgery, and pretend that
it is really all for us that this is happening, or that we are in a sense
partners and not slaves. The songs the workman sings at his work, when he
does, are about frivolous matters or in any case not about the subject
of his employment. In the same way our best speculations and finest art
is <I>not</I> about "reality" or our mechanical job, but abstractions
that remove us from it.

<I>Two copies of this article exist: a typescript of five leaves with a
cover leaf inscribed by Lewis, </I>"The Machine. |<I> </I>typescript for
article. | <I>Wyndham Lewis," and a carbon of the same typescript. The
first is at Buffalo, the second at Cornell. The typing is poor and
inaccurate, and both copies have occasional marks (probably by Mrs. Lewis)
separating words that the typist has run together. The carbon has one
spelling correction, but neither copy has been properly corrected. The
essay was probably written in 1934 or 1935, when Lewis published a series
of articles on industrial art and the machine. The subject was topical
in literature, design, and architecture. Its political side is brought
out most clearly in "Shropshire Lads or Robots Again" and "Power-feeling
and Machine-Age Art."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<I> Lewis associates enthusiasm for machinery in the arts with political
enthusiasm for the industrialisation of the Soviet Union and its
accompanying feats of social engineering--enthusiasm in which he did not
share. Lewis's theories of the necessity for human imperfection conflicted
with his modernist utopian ambitions (expressed in the 1919 pamphlet,
</I>The Caliph's Design: Architects! Where is Your Vortex?<I>).</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
<I> Mechanical perfection dissolves human identity. "The Machine"
bears traces of Lewis's admiration of the architecture of the Berbers
of North Africa, whose romantic (and "European") barbarism he praises
in </I>Kasbahs and Soukhs,<I> an unfinished book of the early 1930s,
sections of which are included in </I>Journey into Barbary: Morocco
Writings and Drawings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">
--<A HREF="#authbio">Paul Edwards</A>

<P>

<B></B>

<P>
If we confine ourselves to things of which we have ocular
evidence--excluding all modes of life or art that might come about, or
that <I>should</I> come about, or that might have been, or should have
been--then no argument is possible, I think, when those two modes are
contrasted--the human mode and the non-human mode. The human modes are
the better and brighter.

<P>
If by the fiat of a despot a city could be built (such as I imagined in
<I>The Caliph's Design</I> or <I>Architects, Where is Your Vortex</I>) and
if the despot could be so trained and so endowed--his state so rich in
resources, possessing such transcendent workmen, politically so firmly
established etc. etc. etc.--as to ensure a maximum result, in speed,
effort and intelligence, then, of course, the city that would be built
would be second to none in history, it would be far better than any city
ever built.

<P>
But that is a city of <I>Ifs and Ans</I> [<I>sic</I>], for a rather
vulgar streak somewhere in the mind of the despot, for instance, would
be enough to spoil the city.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Meanwhile <I>the human</I> seems to have the advantage of the
 <I>non-human,</I> or the superhuman. Where men have physically been
 able to act the giant, and chop through nature, instead of crawling
 over it, in the manner of Lilliput, and override an accident, instead
 of accommodating themselves to it, they have not been able to supply
 the appropriate <I>mind</I> for the super-body, that is the trouble.

<P>
There are no rules for cities of course: Venice is built upon the
most disadvantageous basis imaginable, a stork of a city: Manhattan
on the other hand depends for its existence upon the rock-mass beneath
it. You might cite Venice as an example of Man imposing his will upon
the waters. But in fact the charm of Venice <I>is</I> the waters,
of course. The obstacle (technically) turns out to be prime factor,
aesthetically. With Manhattan the rock underneath is of no importance
except as a socket and platform. And after all the Earth itself must
always play <I>that</I> role in anything we undertake upon its surface.

<P>
Taking Venice and Manhattan together--the first as a specimen of human
art (typifying a human submission to the natural beauty of the waters),
the second a specimen of the non-human--then, I think, in its heyday
of course, Venice could be the better place, as the Venetian is the
better man.

<P>
So we have to admit it seems to me that at a period when man has not been
powerful enough to transform the accidental dispositions of nature--with
no dynamite to blast, or rock-drills, say--and is compelled to build
the streets of his cities in and out and up and down, inventing, as
he goes along, untried architectural devices, delightful deformities
and structural freaks, then (it is but too plain) the result is more
satisfactory. By following the vast, non-human, lines of nature,
our human arts score their best successes. Projecting his tortuous,
not yet oppressive, geometry, out upon the chaotic superstructures,
being methodic where he can, in the teeth of natural disorder, man is
seen at his best. He then produces something of intellectual as well
as emotional value, which the unadulterated stark geometry of the
Machine-Age precludes.

<P>
It pains me to say this. And I wish I could assert with a propagandist
emphasis that someday the Machine would be put in its place and man rule
over Machine and

<B></B>

 nature alike. But I believe that the problem of <I>scale</I> is at the
 centre of these particular problems of art. It is easier to put the
 soul of a god in the body of a man than vice versa apparently. All
 the Machine so far has done is to <I>enlarge,</I> as you enlarge a
 small photograph. Will it ever be allowed to enlarge, or to multiply,
 anything <I>good?</I> The Machine is able to bloat to a hundred times
 the size something trivial, or repeat in innumerable exemplars something
 foolish. This is what usually it does. When it reproduces the Mona Lisa,
 or Van Gogh's <I>Postman</I> ten thousand times it is doubtful if that
 is an improvement. Should it enlarge it the same number of times it
 would of course be meaningless. The Machine imitates, it enlarges, it
 multiplies, or Man through it. But so far there has been a watering
 down, only, or vulgarising of pre-Machine-Age effort. And this
 of course has coincided with the notion of the supersession of the
 Individual by the Mass. Perhaps the destiny of the Machine is involved
 with the destiny of the Mass?

<P>
Ten thousand dull chair-legs (of Windsor Chair pattern) enlarged a
hundred-fold, and placed in two rows upon Salisbury Plain, would knock
Stonehenge into a cocked hat no doubt. But no question of <I>art</I>
would be involved, any more than in the impact of a giant comet, or, if
you like, in the size of a nebula.

<P>
The Machine has been courted and denounced: but even more important than
the question of the Machine, is the <I>natural</I> fashion in which all
human societies grow and flower and perish. Can a conscious or mechanical
canon be imposed upon them? I have always held that ideally it would
be more satisfactory if this limitation of natural growth--the waxing
and flourishing plant-status--could give place with us to something
more deliberate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P>
There has to be not only the power, in short (which is conferred upon
society by the development of mechanical technique) but also the <I>will
to invention,</I> to beauty, significance and so forth. China and Japan
are today a terrible object-lesson in how with the Machine comes in
Barbarity.

<P>
Just as the old art (which I have called human art) has derived its
significance from the accidental character of the surface of nature
(without attempting to flatten it out or tidy it up), may not the will
to invent depend also on the brutal accidents of the surface of a given
society, and the accidents, again, of a secluded situation, or a local
and temporary prosperity? Or we can put this in another way. It may
be <I>parasitic upon nature only.</I> Once the social landscape, as it
were, has been humanly flattened out, tidied up, or even has been very
much interfered with, and lost its "primitive"--its human--character,
this parasite may die off, or forget its cunning.

<P>
In the midst of all these speculations, the only thing that is quite
certain is that the various graphic and plastic arts are upon all
hands in a state of decay. In spots, the building art alone is not
quite dead. The Cinema, in its capacity of Kinetic Plastic--or "Moving
Statue," or of moving monochrome picture, or Tableau Vivant--is very
active, certainly, very proselytising and perfervid. But the Cinema
(the only Cinema that counts) is a social doctrine as well as an art I
think. It is far too handy a vehicle for all that is second-rate--as a
mode of expression for people who would be doomed to second-rateness,
and that is failure, in other directions--not to be suspect.

<B></B>

<P>
So what we come back to here is the problem again of the Machine:
for the conquest of the Redskin by the European colonist was not the
conquest of a lower type by a higher necessarily. It was the triumph
of the rifle. Ultimately, it was the triumph of <I>the inventor of the
rifle</I>--not certainly of the people who manufacture or use it. --May
not the Machine play a similar role, destructive of all value and human
significance, in the field of art that it has in the field of politics?

<I>"Berlin Revisited" exists as a fifteen-page autograph manuscript
in the Lewis archive at Cornell. The first page is inscribed (not in
Lewis's hand) "Blasting &amp; Bombardiering," but in fact Lewis and his
wife visited Germany and Poland in October 1937, immediately after the
publication of that autobiography. (See Jeffrey Meyers, </I>The Enemy:
A Biography of Wyndham Lewis;<I> the 1935 visit mentioned in the first
sentence of the article is not recorded by Meyers.)</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<I> During the mid-1930s, Lewis's promotion of an understanding with
the new Nazi regime in Germany brought him close to being an unofficial
apologist for it. His fear of a repetition of World War I, in which
he had served as an artillery officer, was an inextricable part of his
attitude. </I>Count Your Dead: They are Alive!,<I> published in April
1937, is the climax of his campaign. After the 1937 visit, Lewis made no
more attempts to persuade the British public of the beneficence of the
Nazis, and, as his biographer notes, decisively distanced himself from
anti-Semitism. "Berlin Revisited," then, records a visit that seems to
have coincided with the turning point in Lewis's attitude to Hitler's
Germany. It does not itself record the change of attitude, however. An
"extremely vulnerable"  Germany is still seen as a potential victim
of aggression. But Lewis is clearly disappointed by the lack of a heroic
temper in Berlin's well-dressed bourgeoisie (which indicates that he had
expected the Nazis to induce one). The shoppers and caf&eacute;-loungers
of Third City in the 1955 </I>Monstre Gai <I>(sometimes taken as a
reflection of Lewis's attitude to the Welfare State in postwar Britain)
clearly </I>

<B></B>

<I>owe something to his memories of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm in 1937.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
<I> In </I>Count Your Dead,<I> Lewis had half insinuated the existence of
a conspiracy by Jewish financiers to undermine European society by war,
just as Russia had been subverted by communism. He was shocked by his
visit to the Warsaw Ghetto, but there was evidently not yet sufficient
change in his worldview for him to do more than record without comment the
heroic or desperate Herr Israel's absurdist defiance of persecution.</I>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">
--<A HREF="#authbio">Paul Edwards</A>

<P>
A week or so ago I dropped into Berlin, which I had not visited
for two years. This time I stayed in a small hotel off the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm. The Kurf&uuml;rstendamm is a big boulevard,
thick with caf&eacute;s. It is a sort of little Paris consisting of
a single great boulevard, created under the Br&uuml;ning and earlier
r&eacute;gimes, in stark contrast with the old imperial city.

<P>
The "terraces" of these caf&eacute;s which lie thick along the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm are for the most part sumptuous marquees. Within these
spacious tents, infested with palms, the elegant ladies and gentlemen of
the new Berlin discuss coffee and cakes. These great <I>Konditoreien</I>
are somewhat oppressively respectable, and incidentally extremely
expensive.

<P>
It takes you a few days to sort out the essentials of this swarming
tent-life, of Berlin's fashionable boulevard. The first thing you remark
is the admirable taste displayed in all the clothes, hats, and shoes
worn. There is a great surface effect of luxury. But these are only
<I>Konditoreien,</I> or cake-and-coffee palaces, after all. If you go
into the equivalent of these places in the matter of restaurants--the
<I>Weinrestaurant</I>--you will find that more than half the customers
are not eating, or not more than one dish. They have the wine but not
the food of the wine-restaurant, many of them, whereas in London or
Paris they would all be eating a four-course dinner.

<P>
After this, and a few similar discoveries, seeing the extreme smartness,
notwithstanding, of these half-eaters, or mere drinkers, you will be
disposed to say to yourself that these Germans put all their available
cash on their backs.

<P>
But that would not be entirely correct. There is an explanation for this
paradoxal smartness. It is probably true to say that they put too much
of their money on their backs, and think too much of sitting for an hour
or two in the palmy tent of a <I>Konditorei,</I> over a cup of coffee,
trying to look as much as possible like a very rich and idle sportsman
or sportswoman, reposing after a strenuous day on the tennis-court. But
there is another factor which has to be taken into account.

<P>
If, after leaving the masses of sunburnt elegants toying with a cake and
exhibiting themselves to the passers-by, or entertaining each other in
the seclusion of an enormous marquee, you walk along the boulevard, you
will find yourself passing shop after shop of the extremest luxury. That
delicious mackintosh, with steel clasps in place of buttons, those
multi-coloured half-sandals, those attractive flounced jackets you have
just seen upon the bodies of the coffee-drinkers, you now see in the shop-windows.<B></B>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Approaching the shop-window, you find to your astonishment that they cost
 very little. The shoes that impressed you so much are only twelve marks
 and a half; the dresses which create such a voguish effect range from
 fifteen to fifty marks; there is a very smart straw helmet for ten pence!

<P>
It is not quite true, therefore, that these people put all their money
on their backs. For two or three pounds they can dress up like their
favourite film-heroine or hero, and cut a dash as a coffee drinker. And
for two or three marks they can exhibit themselves--they seldom talk
much, they are too busy looking and being looked at--sipping a <I>Moka</I>
and nibbling a cake.

<P>
The Germans have their fair share of the lady-and-gentleman complex, as
it might be called, of the modern democracy. Every nation has its own
variety of this absurdity. Where the Germans differ is that, with their
matchless efficiency, they have a far more thorough way of indulging
it and of showing it off. These big marquees and open tents in the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm are colossal tableau-vivants of genteelness.

<P>
What Hitler, with his dreams of a "classless society," must think of
all this I cannot imagine. But I suppose he doesn't think about it at
all, he has too much to attend to, building up the armoured shell for
his extremely vulnerable country.

<P>
The Kurf&uuml;rstendamm is still run by the Jews, or rather most of the
big shops still seem to be jewish--only they are diabolically cheap. Have
these keen traders been left there on the understanding that they smarten
up the Berliners at cost price? As a sort of defiance over one shop I
noticed, in large capitals, the name ISRAEL. Approaching it, I found it
was a dress shop. But the dresses were all most deplorably outmoded,
even crumpled, and one or two actually hung upside down. Imagine this
happening in the middle of Bond Street. A large shop, the window full
of a provincial stock, displayed with a deliberate, as it were insolent,
carelessness.

<P>
What Herr Israel may mean by this I cannot guess. With his coreligionists
all round it is a case of "business-as-usual." Only the implacable
Israel refuses to play, it would seem! With all his flags at half-mast
he breasts the storm.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P>
After having observed at my leisure the fashionable world of the
Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, I thought I would see what these people read. For
what <I>books</I> would go with this sort of outlook I felt I should like
to know. Entering one of the best of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm bookshops,
I bought a Dolphin--or a Penguin--and put to the gentleman who served
me my difficulty.

<P>
I had been much impressed, I told him, by the crowds I had seen outside,
and I wished to know what they read. Six or seven years ago, I informed
him, I had been greatly distressed to see nothing but detective stories
in the windows of German shops. This great intellectual nation had abased
itself before Edgar Wallace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Today there were none. Did this signify that today the German taste
 was better?

<P>
No, he answered, their taste was not better. Was it then worse? I
asked. No, he said. He volunteered the information that they had much
more money to spend today than a few years ago. Ah: but then their taste
<I>must</I> be better, said I. For they read better books.

<B></B>

<P>
He smiled. He said that did not follow. He said it was not because their
taste was better but because they could not get them, that they did not
read detective stories.

<P>
The German writers were all so ambitious and conceited, they
<I>refused</I> to write detective stories, it seemed. This I gathered
was one of the results of the new r&eacute;gime. He frankly regretted
this ambitious temper or this "author-complex," as we should call it
in England.

<P>
Besides, he informed me, intelligent people all liked detective stories. I
raised my eyebrows in astonishment. Noticing my surprise, he smiled
again. He assured me that that was the case.

<P>
I ventured the opinion that for a very intelligent man it might be an
excellent thing to read a crime story, but for the multitude crime
stories and nothing else was not the most suitable fare. That was a
point of view that was worth considering, he thought.

<P>
This was a bookseller of considerable pretensions. When I asked
him what anglo saxon books he sold most of he answered immediately
Santayana. Santayana is surely the softest and silkiest of all
philosophers. But my question had not contemplated the possibility
of philosophical nibblings. I had meant fiction. And for a great
philosophical race to indulge in Santayana was not very creditable,
anyway. It suggested a considerable weakening of the teeth.

<P>
I brought him back to earth, however, by saying I had had <I>fiction</I>
in mind. Morgan's <I>Fountain</I> seemed the next, after Santayana.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 I held up my finger peremptorily and said--

<P>
"You have forgotten!" He looked startled.

<P>
"Forgotten?" he asked.

<P>
"Yes," said I. "There is another name that should have come before that
of Morgan. Think again!"

<P>
He looked confused.

<P>
"Galsworthy!" I thundered.

<P>
For a fraction of a second he looked still more confused. Then he
assumed, as best he could, an expression of imperious indifference,
although palpably shaken.

<P>
"Galsworthy--yes," he exclaimed. "A year ago, perhaps. Not today. That
is over."

<P>
The meaning of all this is as follows. Galsworthy has for a long time been
the bible of the Germans. Middleclass Germany has absorbed the <I>Forsyte
Saga</I> to the exclusion of almost any other English author--excepting,
of course, Morgan's <I>Fountain,</I> from which cheaply platonic spring
they still refresh themselves in prodigious gulps.

<P>
The full nectar of the kindred <I>respectability</I> of Anglosaxony
was somehow to be found in Galsworthy more than in any other British
importation. A young German, for instance, told me that his sister, a
typical German girl, had read the <I>Forsyte Saga</I> ten times. He said
that when he would arrive home late at night--however late--he would
see a light in her room. Looking into it he would see her asleep, with
the <I>Forsyte Saga</I> still in her hand.

<P>
When this young German paid a visit to London he naturally bought
picture-postcards of Pall Mall, the Horseguards, and of the Houses of
Parliament. These he sent

<B></B>

to his sister in Berlin. On his return, he found that his sister had
stuck these postcards into her copy of the <I>Forsyte Saga,</I> opposite
the pages where the story speaks of these historic scenes.

<P>
All this I knew: I knew that to speak of the German Reading Public and
not to mention Galsworthy would be a case of Hamlet without the Prince
of Denmark.

<P>
After this visit to the <I>Buchhandlung</I> of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm I
made it my business to visit many other bookshops. The three bestsellers
among English books were, in every case, Galsworthy, Col. Lawrence, and
Morgan's <I>Fountain.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Those were always the first names that came to their lips. Of American
 books, Wolfe, the author of <I>Look Homeward Angel,</I> was the big
 noise. They had prospectuses from the Rowohltverlag of all his books,
 with the fine jewish head of the author on the cover. Hemingway is
 forbidden--Hemingway who is the incarnation of the spirit of physical
 adventure, the "tough guy" par excellence, and of all American authors
 the one you would think with most appeal for the Nazi Youth--the most
 unexceptionably "virile" reading.

<P>
For the rest, there is a spate of fashionable amateurs from England--such
as Mr Richard Wyndham and Mr Harold Nicholson.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The latter gentleman refuses categorically to put his foot upon German
 soil, so great is his loathing for the Dritte Reich: but his books
 embellish all the shop-windows.

<P>
When one considers that the publication of books in Germany is rigidly
censored, these are eccentricities, to say the least. But these books are
not bestsellers. That is a curiosity of the censorship <I>Abteilung</I>
[department], and is no indication of German taste. For you may bring a
horse to the water, but you cannot, necessarily, make him drink. What
the German bookbuyer--that is to say the middle class--drinks down
in great draughts is Galsworthy. The lady-and-gentleman complex, as I
have called it, is satisfied by that better than by anything else. It
is deep calling to deep--the deep British respectability of Galsworthy
is answered by the deep respectability of the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm.

<P>
Politics are far from my mind. The Nazi revolution is now an accomplished
fact. There it is, whether you like it or not: and I am not one of
those who has spent his time abusing it. But one thing we may surely
deduce from this scrutiny of the bookshops: namely that a kindred
<I>respectability,</I> almost as tenacious as that of England, has
survived, intact, into the new era.

<P>
"Tell me what a man eats, and I will tell you what he <I>is!</I>" Well,
for anybody who is able to augur from a book as well as some can from
a gastronomic <I>dossier,</I> the words "Forsyte" and "Fountain" are
eloquent.

<P>
A delusion of the Englishman--one among many--with respect to his German
cousin, is that the German is invariably crude and rough. We have in
England a disease called "refaynment"--something that causes the poor
fellow afflicted with it to say "nayce" instead of "nice."

<P>
But the German can be just as "refayned" if not more so. Do not run
away with the idea that every German gives utterance to a trenchant
"Nein!" when desiring to express negation. No. There are just as many
Germans who say "Nayn," or "fayn," for "nein" or "fein," as there are
Englishmen who say "nayce" for "nice."

<B></B>

<P>
Another illusion of the Englishman's is that the Germans are an
"intellectual" nation. That is of course absurd. The middleclass that was
dispossessed by the collapse of the <I>valuta</I> [exchange rate] just
after the war (to which, ultimately, the Nazi revolution must be traced)
yearn with an almost pathological intensity for <I>respectability.</I>
And, as a passion, respectability is at the opposite pole to the passions
of the intellect, if one may so express oneself.

<P>
I received, while I was in Germany, as great an impression as ever of
massive physical energy. Passing from Germany into Poland, the contrast,
in this respect, is very great. I should, quite dispassionately,
advise any country to think twice before it started dropping bombs on
the Germans. But in all those matters where sensibility and artistic
intelligence are concerned, it is another story. I must confess to having
experienced a certain shock, upon realizing the ineradicable "nayceness"
of the modern German mind. You know what it is--when you find that the
gladiator reads <I>Little Lord Fauntleroy</I> in his spare time, it is
sort of disillusioning. It should have been Aeschylus!

writer Richard Wyndham (1896-1948) was satirized as Dick Whittingdon
in <I>The Apes of God.</I> Harold Nicholson (1886-1968), associated
with the Bloomsbury Group through marriage to Virginia Woolf's lover Vita
Sackville-West, wrote a number of biographies during the 1930s. Initially
a supporter of Oswald Mosley's New Party, he became a National Labour
Member of Parliament in 1935, and was vigorous in his opposition to
dictatorship.

<P>
<I>On 7 June 1936 Wyndham Lewis wrote to Geoffrey Grigson that the next
day he would be handing in a "large book" to his publisher. That book
was probably the novel</I> The Revenge for Love, <I>which appeared in
May 1937.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<I> Completing it left Lewis free to work on other things, which came to
include his autobiography,</I> Blasting and Bombardiering, <I>finished
in the summer of 1937 and published on 29 October 1937.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
<I> Despite bad health, since early 1935 Lewis had been working on
several writing projects, paintings, and books. One of them may have
been the autobiography, but no mention of it appears in his letters
and manuscripts until February 1937, when Lewis signed a contract with
William Morrow for an American edition of the book.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
<I>When did Lewis begin</I> Blasting and Bombardiering? <I>It seems not
to have been on his mind in April 1936, when in a letter he mentions
working on his "large novel"</I> (The Revenge for Love), <I>"a large
political book"</I> (Left Wings Over Europe), <I>and a "short novel</I>
The Roaring Queen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
<I> In August of that year Lewis was in serious financial trouble;
he owed money to his doctor for one of several operations to correct
complications from gonorrhea.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
<I> By 16 October, his lack of money had grown urgent. Lewis told Oliver
Brown, the dealer for his paintings, to arrange for a sitter: "One
relatively well-paid portrait--or two ill-paid ones--would . . . settle
all my illness-debts."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 <I>Lewis was eager to compromise his artistic principles for ready
 cash. He wrote Brown, "To hell with these experimental 'difficult'
 contraptions, which only the Young and impecunious in </I>

<B></B>

<I>England, like [</I>sic<I>] and which are hard to sell--I will do no
more for six months, or until I am solvent. I will really do dreams of
beauty, which will sell themselves, as I am bringing them down to the
Gallery. This I mean, in sober earnest."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
<I> Just three days later, the London</I> Times <I>ran an article
previewing the newspaper's publication of letters by Prime Minister
Gladstone.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
<I> In a preface, ultimately rejected, for the book that became</I>
Blasting and Bombardiering, <I>Lewis refers to having seen this article
"the other day" . When he wrote this preface in late October or
early November 1936, he had probably not written much, if anything, of the
autobiography, for the book he introduces to his readers is not the book
he eventually published. The preface adumbrates a book of gossip about
his fellow highbrow artists; in the autobiography, however, that material
is relegated to the last section, part 5; the first four parts concern
Lewis's war experiences as a soldier and an artist. Lewis's title for the
preface to the book he then thought of as "The Men of 1914"</I> <I>was
"Preliminary Aside to the Reader; regarding Gossip, and its pitfalls."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P>
<I>It is likely, then, that the idea of writing an autobiography came
to Lewis in the fall of 1936 as another way to relieve his extreme
financial pressures. The rejected preface reveals Lewis's anxieties about
making his autobiography appeal to a public receptive to the novels of
J. B. Priestley and war memoirs like Robert Graves's</I> Goodbye to All
That <I>. It also shows Lewis struggling awkwardly to accommodate
himself to middle-class readers who buy books at railway-station
bookstalls. Despite his genial attempts to rouse their interest in
himself and his artist friends, Lewis cannot hide his contempt for their
anti-intellectuality.</I>

<P>
<I>Lewis continued to think of the book as a memoir of his relations
with other writers and artists at least until February 1937, when he
signed the contract for a book titled</I> Blasting and Bombardiering
<I>with William Morrow. Lewis must have described the autobiography to
his editor at Morrow, Charles Halliwell Duell, as a book of reminiscences
primarily about other artists, for in the late summer when Duell received
the first six chapters treating Lewis's own experience of the onset
of war, he balked, refusing to publish the book. Duell wrote Lewis,
"I cherished the notion that your book would have enough to say about
enough well-known res and would so thoroughly express your own
personality that it would appeal widely to American readers."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
<I> Duell had received six chapters of a very different book than he
had contracted for, despite the fact that, coming from the former editor
of</I> Blast, <I>the book's title might have suggested to him a balance
between Lewis's life as an artist and as a soldier.</I>

<P>
<I>The major change in Lewis's conception of the book seems to have
occurred in the spring of 1937, after the contract with Morrow was
signed. Despite his disappointment with the book's first six chapters,
Duell had been expecting some material on Lewis's experiences in the war,
for in May he was under the impression that Lewis was "re-work[ing] the
war scenes."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
<I> The manuscripts and galleys show, however, that in four of the
book's five parts, Lewis was concentrating on his own experiences as
a soldier and artist; only part 5 preserved the promised focus on his
fellow artists. Some material now in part 5, in which Lewis theorizes
on the place of art in modern </I>

<B></B>

<I>society, seems to have been written very early on under the title
"The Men of 1914" and may have been the first section Lewis drafted.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
<I> Later on in the process of composition, that material as well as the
chapters on Joyce, Pound, and Eliot became part 2 (perhaps of two parts
in all). In the reworking in the spring of 1937, all of it became part
5, following four other parts devoted mainly to Lewis's war; portions
of the draft chapter on Joyce were moved into the introduction.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<I> As</I> Blasting and Bombardiering <I>took its final shape, Lewis
would have realized that the early preface about the troubles of a writer
gossiping about other writers was a completely unsuitable introduction
to the autobiographical account of his life from 1914 through 1926 that
the book had become.</I>

<P>
<I>The significance of the rejected preface is that it helps document the
reasons for the opening up of Lewis's work in the mid-1930s to simple
human realities and emotions. In accounts of Lewis's career,</I> The
Revenge for Love <I>and</I> Blasting and Bombardiering <I>have served
as markers of a relaxation in Lewis's hard-edged public role as "The
Enemy."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<I> The rejected preface reveals that one motivation for Lewis to become
slightly more tolerant of human vulnerability was his own need to find a
way to appeal to the tastes of the middle-class book-buying public. This
was a challenge for an artist whose career, since the days of</I> Blast,
<I>had moved forward while he ignored, dismissed, analyzed, or flouted
just such tastes. In the rejected preface, we see Lewis struggling to
come to grips with the new opportunities and dangers of finding common
ground with readers to whom he felt he had very little of real interest
to offer, except gossip.</I>

<P>
<I>Original capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and underlining are
preserved. Typographical errors that Lewis corrected have been corrected
silently here; typos that Lewis left standing are reproduced. Complete
words that Lewis changed while typing remain and are cancelled with a
solid line.</I>

<H2><!--_title-->
<U>Preliminary Aside to the Reader</U>;

regarding Gossip, and its pitfalls.
<!--_/title-->
</H2>

<P>
I am about to gossip. I am going to be exceedingly "personal" about
certain persons. But this is not at all because I wish to be. It is
because of <U>you</U> that I descend to these picturesque details. Quite
at the start it is far better that I should lay the blame where it is
due - namely at your door - for anything that is of too familiar a nature
that may be uttered in these pages.

<P>
When the <U>Times</U> the other day was announcing the appearance in
its columns of extracts from letters exchanged by Mr Gladstone and Mrs
Gladstone, "The Thunderer" purred:

<P>
"We may see Mr. Gladstone winning 8d at cards from the Prince of Wales,
and tearing his court suit while he dresses in a hurry; Princess Beatrice
being chased and caught by Jenner to have a loose tooth out; the Gladstone
children kissed by the

<B></B>

 Queen. Mr. Gladstone drying his wet socks out of the railway carriage
 window, deep in "The Woman in White" etc.'
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P>
If such blandishments are necessary on the part of "the Thunderer", how
much more are they not required of me, who have no eagles at my beck?

<P>
I have no caries of the teeth of Mr. T. S. Eliot to tempt you with,
I fear, but I have a particularly disagreable affliction of the eyes
in the matter of Mr. James Joyce: I <U>can</U> show the author of the
<U>Waste Land</U> engrossed in a "Crime Club" thriller - but on the other
hand his socks will be on his feet. I have no clothesline at a railway
carriage window, unfortunately,with which to catch your eye - the best
I can do as regards underclothes is to borrow Mr. George Moore's pants
from Mr Yeats for the occasion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Still, I have pleanty of shots in my locker: I can tell you to one ounce
 how much alcohol two of the most outstanding highbrows can carry, and
 as to kissing children, the worthy Ezra kisses any children he can lay
 his hands on and even pats a quantity of quite big boys on the head.

<P>
Have I "that terrible gift, familiarity?" Or am I too unfamiliar? Time
alone will <S>tell.</S> show.

<P>
     No. Much more concerned with ideas that I am with people, I
     <U>have</U>, all right, a familiar vein. And I do recognize, with
     very great <S>cleverness</S> clearness, that straight "ideas" is
     not at all <S>what</S> the Publics cup of tea.

<P>
Ideas the Public does not relish. Or at least it likes its ideas to be
incarnated, to take on flesh and blood. It abhors the vacuum, as it feels
it to be, of a disembodied notion. The breath and bustle of life are
all in all to it; and the laws by which that bustle is goverened - the
"ideas I speak of - it will describe as "over its head". And with things
"over its head" it will have no truck. If it is desirious of acquiring
ideas, it prefers to come by them <U>without tears</U>. It finds it
more agreable to extract them, in small quantities, out of a mass of
inorganic and drifting gossip.

<P>
All this being so, I become a gossip, in the present instance. Also, my
Public is the Anglosaxon. I have no choice in the matter. The instinct
to analyse and to disembody, and to translate the things we call persons
back again into their platonic archetypes - that instinct must be sternly
repressed. Even I must not allow these souls of things to peep out too
much, as I proceed with my lighthearted tale of a family of lions at
play. As I report the activities set in motion upon the plane of gossip
by these dynamic abstractions - these ideas or idealogies that govern
us - I must keep the latter carefully out of sight.

<P>
Under these circumstances let me confess and then have done with it,
that this is, all the same, a history of ideas. It records the birth
of the system of ideas which is now in the ascendant. But it would be a
thoroughly repulsive proposition to undertake a "history of ideas." No one
would stand for it, from the publisher to Smith's Station bookstall. And
it is my ambition to lie upon Smiths station book-stall side by side with
Mr. Priestley - the lamb lying down with the lion. How should I ever
do that without showing the same careful regard for the Public that is
shown by the author of "Good Companions"?

<B></B>

<P>
Yes, I have decided to be a "good companion". I will show what stuff I am
made of, and make a hearty picaresque affair full of jolly incidents, of
all this highbrow business. As Father O'Flynn with great spirit protested:
"Cannot the clergy be Irishmen too?" I will show that they can be - I
mean that the biggest highbrows of the lot are jolly good sports, as
merry as grigs
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 and if Mr. Priestley has not coined money out of them yet, and put them
 on the map, it is only because it has never, luckily, occurred to him
 to do so.

<P>
This is the explanation of how I have come to adopt the approach indirect:
to dilate upon Mr. Pound's plush jacket. and Mr. Joyce's patent-leather
shoes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 I am out to popularise Pound, to jack up Joyce' stocks, and make my
 own alarming name a little less horrific.

<P>
But if I am going to gossip, I am, like all gossips, confronted with a
rather puzzling little problem. Especially the gossip who is committing
himself to paper is exposed to this difficulty (were he merely gossiping
away in a club or in a pub he would be as safe as houses). He must not,
in a word, lay himself open to the charge of being a "poison pen". That
is the snag, in setting out to please.

<P>
At all costs I must avoid appearing "malicious" or "savage". The
Anglosaxon will not tolerate that. But on the other hand how on earth
am I going to be even passably entertaining about these eminent persons
without offending against the canon of kindness and even decorum - for
some of the habits of Lions are distinctly free and easy? Above all, how
am I ever going to pass myself off as a Good Companion, and lie side by
side upon the bookstalls in the railway stations with Mr. Priestley, if
I betray a suspicious indifference to the great unwritten law of <U>It
isn't done?</U> - For (between ourselves) <U>I mean to do it.</U> I am
determined to be jolly good company, an uproariously good sort and damn
the consequences. My only fear is that I might find that I had been <U>too
good</U> a fellow! That is the danger with me - I have to guard against
my tendancy never to do things by halves. For then I might after all
not find myself lying cosily side by side with Mr. Priestley or Miss Baum
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 upon the railway bookstall, but squatting cheek by jowl with some
 embezzler in one of His Majesty's jails.

<P>
These celebrated highbrow cronies of mine about whom I am writing
<S>about</S> are in fact of the same flesh and blood with yourself,
however: greatness is a superstition of the little, and apart from the
fact that they are not terribly fond of golf and bridge, and a few minor
difficulties of that order, they are no more alarming that a Slate Club
or Territorial Mess. To a man they are 'fond of a drop' (though you will
<S>never</S> have to take this on trust, as the laws of this country do
not allow me to a show a living character consuming a highball or a pint
of beer).

<P>
My subjects are the vessels of those disagreable <U>ideas</U> I
was speaking about just now: and those are in fact my quarry, I have
admitted. But you must remember that in consequence of this more esoteric
purpose I am handicapped. Mr. Priestley would have me beat - he would
sell three books to my one - if I did not prove myself a <U>better</U>

<B></B>

companion than he was. It is not enough to be as good. And the trouble
is how to overstep that decorous limit without appearing a little
disreputable.

<P>
Or take Mr. Robert Graves - I have to be prepared to lie on the station
bookstall between Mr. Priestley and <U>Goodbye to all that!</U> now a
classic bestseller. But obviously where Mr. Graves says "Goodbye to all
that", I have to say "Cheerio to the bloody shoot", or just "I'm through
with all that, buddie!"

Wyndham Lewis to Geoffrey Grigson, 7 June 1936, Wyndham Lewis Collection,
Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Carl A. Kroch Library,
Cornell University. <I>The Revenge for Love</I> was more substantial
than other books he published in 1936 or 1937 and thus more likely to be
considered by Lewis a major work. The satire <I>The Roaring Queen,</I>
which was printed but not published in 1936 for fear of libel, had been
all but finished since at least 1932, when Desmond Harmsworth turned it
down under the title <I>The Roaring Quean</I> (Omar S. Pound and Philip
Grover, <I>Wyndham Lewis: A Descriptive Bibliography</I> [Folkestone,
Kent: Wm. Dawson and Sons, 1978], 38). The political essays <I>Left
Wings Over Europe</I> and <I>Count Your Dead: They Are Alive!</I>
appeared in 1936 and 1937, respectively; the autobiography <I>Blasting
and Bombardiering</I> appeared in 1937.

Five other draft introductions to the book exist among the <I>Blasting
and Bombardiering</I> manuscripts, typescripts, galleys, and page proofs
in the Wyndham Lewis Collection at the State University of New York at
Buffalo. In one of the draft introductions, Lewis refers to "The Men
of 1914" as the book's title (box 3, folder 1, Buffalo); in another he
calls it the subtitle (box 4, folder 3.1, Buffalo). Yet another draft
introduction projects an autobiography covering about ten years of Lewis's
life, a decision he stuck by (box 4, folder 3.2, Buffalo). Reading these
drafts, one sees Lewis not only working toward his final conception of
the autobiography, but also piecing together the published introduction.

<P>
In a note on the title page of the manuscript of the rejected preface,
Lewis describes it as a "rejected <I>Preface</I> for 'Blasting
+ Bombardiering': a [illegible] explaining author's approach to
autobiography in question" (box 4, folder 2, Buffalo). This note may have
been written when Lewis was preparing his manuscripts for sale. A little
over a year after <I>Blasting and Bombardiering</I> was published, Lewis
organized some of his papers, perhaps with an eye to selling them, for
in the Lewis Collection at Buffalo is a list of sixty separate books,
sets of page proofs, and manuscripts labeled "Items. Literary dossier
(assembled Nov. 1938)."

<P>
The preface's title page bears two identifications in brackets--"The Men
of 1914" and "Blasting + Bombardiering"--which seem to have been written
at different times. The handwriting of "The Men of 1914" resembles
that of the preface's title, whereas the handwriting of "Blasting +
Bombardiering" resembles that of the note, suggesting that the titles for
both the preface and manuscript were written at the same time, while the
note and the title for the published book were added later. This physical
evidence supports the idea that Lewis wrote the preface for a book titled
"The Men of 1914" that would showcase his associations with his fellow
avant-garde writers and artists.

This alludes to an anecdote about George Moore that Yeats had included in
his recently published autobiographical book, <I>Dramatis Personae</I>
. While bicycling with a friend in the country, Moore went behind

--Ford Madox Ford, July 1915
<!--_/attribution-->

<P>
A story is often told about World War I and the politics of Anglo-American
modernism. Following the lead of writers like Wyndham Lewis and Ezra
Pound, it res the war's impact on the Vorticist movement, which
Lewis and Pound led, as a (if not the) critical factor in shaping
the modernists' postwar politics. The war's senseless destruction, it
explains, intensified the Vorticists' critique of Britain's liberal,
parliamentary government, and encouraged them to support the radical
right-wing parties that arose across Europe between the wars. Given the
ubiquity of the tale, one expects to find numerous studies of <I>Blast:
War Number,</I> the second issue of the Vorticist periodical, published
almost a year into the conflict (July 1915). Even a cursory reading
reveals the journal's active and complex engagement with the war and
home-front life, especially politics and popular culture: it provides
a wealth of valuable evidence of the war's influence on the Vorticist
movement, evidence that illuminates

<B></B>

 the trajectory of modernist art and politics. So it comes as something
 of a surprise that we find comparatively little critical interest in
 <I>Blast</I> 2, particularly in its political art and polemics.

<P>
The scant discussion <I>Blast</I> 2 has provoked suggests another,
related story about Vorticism and the Great War. In this narrative,
the <I>War Number</I> is a rather tragic document of artistic (and
political) concession in the face of war; its less radical, less
innovative artworks and polemics demonstrate not just a decline from
<I>Blast</I> 1's more genuinely oppositional and progressive standards,
or even the lamentable death of Vorticism (or the avant-garde), but
perhaps, and most disturbingly, a tendency to anticipate modernism's
later retrograde politics. At best the <I>War Number</I> is a casualty
of war, at worst an ur-text of fascist modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

<P>
There is truth in both of these accounts. Still, I concur with Samuel
Hynes that <I>Blast</I> 2 is more productively examined in light of
British public discourse and popular culture during the first year of
the Great War.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 When read in this way, the document tells a different story about the
 transformations of modernist art and politics during the conflict, a
 story that raises its own interesting questions about the other two,
 more common tales. Insisting on the importance of its wartime context
 in <I>Blast</I> 2's opening editorial, Lewis described his magazine
 and movement as "surrounded by a multitude of other Blasts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 This essay recovers some of those other "blasts" and articulates
 some of their consequences for our understanding of Vorticism and
 the development of modernist politics. Reading <I>Blast</I> 2 as a
 failure--of aesthetic will or progressive politics--is to misunderstand
 its proclaimed doctrine, artistic practice, and the ways they dovetailed
 with the realities of British life during the war's first year. Because
 the Vorticists had from the start placed at the center of their doctrine
 the allegedly incompatible aims of avant-garde critique and nationalist
 politics, <I>Blast</I> 2 turns out to have been well suited to the
 circumstances of the early war: the conflict created a cultural and
 political environment that validated more powerfully than at any time
 before the war the Vorticists' program of dissenting patriotism in art
 and politics.

<P>
The Vorticists responded polemically to a wartime context in which the
British government was expanding control of public discourse, clamping
down on dissent, and promoting an antimodernist cultural policy,
by reorienting the principal foreign target of their opposition from
Italian Futurism to German (or Prussian) imperialism. The accusations of
<I>pass&eacute;ism,</I> sentimentality, and effeminacy that the Vorticists
had aimed at the Futurists in <I>Blast</I> 1 were now turned on Germany,
which became in <I>Blast</I> 2 the international locus of the cult of
the past and romance, an account used to buttress the new argument that
Vorticism was allied with Britain against Germany.

<P>
Not only did this opportunistic assertion of alliance affirm that modern
English art and artists were participating in life for the highest
stakes--the Vorticists, <I>Blast</I> 2 repeatedly implies, are willing
to t for modernism <I>to the death</I>--but the new realities of
wartime life also validated the Vorticists' aims in a new and more potent
way. The government-sponsored war against modernism gave them a clear
and implacable home-front enemy, ensuring that their art would never
become too fashionable

<B></B>

(as, in their eyes, Futurism had) and thereby demonstrating more
clearly than ever the integrity of their opposition. The war against
Germany gave the Vorticists a new means of affirming their patriotism:
in their willingness to die for the nation's cause--also the cause of
modernism--they could prove, beyond any doubt, the integrity of their
support for empire. And when the movement's resident sculptor, the
Frenchman (and hence ally of the British) Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was
killed in action, the Vorticists' paradoxical program received its
ultimate confirmation: the death of the modern soldier-artist in the
two-front war against Germany and <I>pass&eacute;ism.</I>

<P>
Like most intellectuals who remained in England during the war's first
year, the Vorticists participated actively in the period's public
controversies. The conration of their participation articulates
the confluence of Vorticist doctrine and home-front life. This company
of rebellious artists and writers took up arms in three competing
polemical wars raging on the home front: the government-sponsored
propaganda war against Germany and German <I>Kultur</I> directed by the
Edwardian literary establishment, in which the Vorticists endeavored
to stand alongside their elders as spokesmen for their generation in
the battle against Germany; the avant-gardist war against established
social, political, and artistic institutions, in which they tried to
maintain their prewar effort to revolutionize English art and life;
and, finally, the polemical war against modernism, also led by older
artists and writers, in which <I>Blast</I>'s contributors strove to defend
modern art and literature against accusations of irrelevance, decadence,
even "Junkerism," the worldview of Prussia's landed gentry. To affirm
their dissenting patriotism while defending modernism, the Vorticists
argued in <I>Blast</I> 2 that their war against artistic and political
<I>pass&eacute;ism</I> was an extension of the war against Germany; they
were ting against the German forces of reaction for the future of
Britain and modern art.

<P>
The Department of Information's propaganda war against Germany was
directed by the well-known writer and Liberal M. P., Charles Masterman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Within a month of the declaration of hostilities, he held a meeting of
 "well-known men of letters" for the "organisation of public statements
 of the strength of the British case . . . in the war."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Two weeks later, the <I>Times</I> published a "Declaration by Authors" on
 "Britain's Destiny and Duty" in which fifty-two leading writers publicly
 proclaimed their support for "the cause of the Allies . . . with a full
 conviction of its righteousness," declaring Germany an outlaw nation
 driven to aggression by the "iron military bureaucracy of Prussia."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Among the worthies who affixed their names were H. Granville Barker,
 J. M. Barrie, Arnold Bennett, Robert Bridges, G. K. Chesterton,
 Arthur Conan Doyle, John Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling,
 Arthur Pinero, May Sinclair, and H. G. Wells, a veritable who's who of
 Edwardian culture.

<P>
True to their word, they took up their pens to support the cause. In
a letter to the <I>Times,</I> Poet Laureate Robert Bridges defined the
moral stakes of the conflict, pronouncing

<B></B>

it "a holy war . . . between Christ and the Devil," leaving little
doubt as to the proper response: "The infernal machine which has been
. . . preparing for the last 25 years is now on its wild career like one
of Mr. Wells's inventions, . . . [I]t is the plain duty of all civilized
nations to unite to drive it back into its home and exterminate it there."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Bridges's comparison between Germany's war machine and "Mr. Wells's
 inventions" would not have offended the author of <I>The War of the
 Worlds.</I> From the declaration of war, Wells too had adopted the
 persona of patriotic journalist, churning out in less than a month
 eleven propaganda pieces, one of which summed up the official case
 against "Prussian Imperialism":

Ever since the crushing of the French in 1871 the evil thing has grown and
cast its spreading shadow over Europe. Germany has preached a propaganda

the little, mean, aggressive statesmen and professors who have guided her
destinies to this present conflict have professed . . . an utter disregard

Not surprisingly, the Vorticists joined the t, contending that
their avant-gardist war against <I>pass&eacute;ist</I> art and life was
not only compatible with the war against Germany but an extension of
it. The cover of <I>Blast</I> 2 articulated the argument visually with
a Vorticist vision of the Allied defense by Lewis; its title, <I>Before
Antwerp,</I> identified the modernist soldiers as defenders of the Belgian
city against German assault (<A HREF="4.2peppis_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 <I>Before Antwerp</I> was Lewis's pictorial rejoinder to a celebrated
 work by the nation's

<B></B>

best-known painter, Walter Sickert, entitled <I>The Soldiers of King
Albert the Ready</I> (<A HREF="4.2peppis_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Sickert's impressionistic tableau of Belgians poised for battle against
 German invaders appeared in a December 1914 exhibition at the New
 English Art Club and won praise as a major work of war art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Lewis's visual counterattack expressed commitment to the war against
 Germany and the war for modernism: his angular military men appear at
 once as Allied soldiers braced against German assault and as artistic
 soldiers braced against established art, especially the impressionistic
 realism that dominated prewar art and lingered in works like Sickert's
 <I>Soldiers.</I>

<P>
The <I>War Number</I>'s opening editorial continued the strategy,
going so far as to suggest that because "romance" had inspired Germany's
aggression, <I>Blast,</I> with its long-standing antagonism to all things
romantic, was an essential weapon in the Great War: "Germany has stood
for the old Poetry, for Romance, more steadfastly and profoundly than any
other people in Europe. . . . This paper wishes to stand rigidly opposed,
from start to finish, to every form that the Poetry of a former condition
of life, no longer existing, has foisted upon us" (<I>B,</I> 5). Lewis
had begun developing this argument in a neglected polemic entitled "A
Later Arm than Barbarity," published in the <I>Outlook</I> of September
1914. "Germany is sleep-walking in a bombastic dream of another time,"
he had argued there; "German romance . . . is the goddess whose deity
is just now at stake."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Pursuing this logic, he reasoned that the "nations allied against
 Germany are in reality opposing the interference of the past," but
 stopped short of following this analysis to its implied conclusion by
 never explicitly identifying the avant-garde as one of the "later arms"
 arrayed against German barbarity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 What Lewis only implied in September 1914, <I>Blast</I> 2 declared in
 July 1915: Germans t for the past; the Allies and the forces of
 advanced art t for the future.

The argument failed to convince most British journalists and
intellectuals. Older writers generally attacked modernism, casting it as a
decadent distraction from the pressing realities of war, a symptom of the
national malaise that had contributed to Britain's international decline
and Germany's attendant rise, or a product of the same alien <I>Kultur</I>
menacing Europe (<I>AWI,</I> 58-67). Predictably, England's popular
humor magazine, <I>Punch,</I> took up arms in this war. An October
1914 issue, for example, included an antimodernist cartoon, entitled
"How the Cubist, By a Mere Alteration of Titles, Achieved a Ready Sale
of Unmarketable Pictures" (<A HREF="4.2peppis_3.html"> 3</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 It portrays a nearsighted, scrawny, slope-shouldered "Cubist" who
 succeeds in selling his abstract paintings (which in fact look more
 Futurist than Cubist) to an overweight, hook-nosed, richly dressed--that
 is, stereotypically Jewish--art collector by retitling them "Ruin of
 Window of Rheims Cathedral," "Louvain 1914," and "In the Wake of the
 Huns." Not only does the cartoon ridicule modernism, charging modern
 artists with taking advantage of the war to advance their careers, but
 it exploits visual stereotypes to accuse them of degeneracy and their
 patrons of stupidity and Semitic origin. The "Cubist's" poor physique,
 weak chin, and receding forehead were conventional indicators in prewar
 poster art of the dissipated lunatic, while the collector's

<B></B>

big nose, bald head, and facial hair were markers of the Jew.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 This use of anti-Semitism to assail modernism suggests that the
 modernists had no monopoly on this prejudice.

<P>
Antimodernists fired polemical salvoes at the Vorticists in particular in
a <I>Times</I> review of a March 1915 art exhibition in which Lewis and
his comrades Gaudier-Brzeska, William Roberts, and Edward Wadsworth had
shown works. Under the telling title, "Junkerism in Art," the anonymous
reviewer pronounced the wartime case against the Vorticists, terming
their "rigid" pictures "Prussian in . . . spirit": "These painters seem
to execute a kind of goose-step. . . . [I]f the Junkers could be induced
to take to art, instead of disturbing the peace of Europe, they would
paint so and enjoy it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Lewis responded directly to this attack in <I>Blast</I> 2: "if
 [the Junker] . . . painted, [he] would do florid and disreputable
 canvasses of nymphs and dryads, or very sentimental 'portraits of the
 Junker's mother.' . . . As to goose-steps . . . as an antidote to the
 slop of Cambridge Post Aestheticism . . . may not such 'rigidity' be
 welcomed?" (<I>B,</I> 78-79). Lewis repudiated accusations of
 Junkerism by reiterating the standard Vorticist line: the movement's
 sternly antisentimental art opposed the spirit animating both
 <I>pass&eacute;ist</I> art and the German war effort.

<P>
The Vorticists' stance led them at times to deploy the government's
arsenal of propaganda tactics to defend modernism and assert their
alliance with the national cause. In another polemic, Lewis attempted to
channel popular repulsion at alleged German "atrocities" into support
for modernism. Early in the war, examples of a potent new genre of
propaganda began appearing, which lent the authority of fact to the
popular picture of Germans as brutal barbarians--the Kaiser's Huns
(<I>AWI,</I> 52-56).
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 These works purported to supply documentary evidence of crimes the German
 army committed against innocent civilians and cultural treasures. By
 adducing additional "facts" of German barbarism, Lewis adapted the
 tactic to justify support for modern art:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A fact not generally known in England is that the Kaiser, long before
he entered into the war . . . had declared merciless war on Cubism and
Expressionism. . . . I expect among his orders to his troops is one to
"spare no Cubist prisoners, wounded or otherwise."--I am not implying that
this should be a bond of sympathy between the British Nation and Cubists
or Vorticists. I only mention it as an interesting fact. [<I>B,</I> 9]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Yet the war against modernism led the Vorticists elsewhere in <I>Blast</I>
to protest the very strategy pursued here. Because <I>Blast</I> 2
insisted that the Vorticists t with the nation against Germany, its
polemics assailed in particular those attacks on modernism that exploited
anti-German feeling. One of Lewis's "War Notes" aggressively opposed
the tactic, which he termed the "Exploitation of Blood," arguing that
"there is a sort of blackguard . . . who uses the blood of the Soldier
for his own everyday domestic uses. . . . [C]ritics . . . on the side of
lucrative and established forms of art, . . . who take this opportunity
. . . to attack the [modern] movement in Painting . . . are an exact
parallel to the Burglar in the earthquake" (<I>B,</I> 24).

<B></B>

<P>
By protesting such opportunism, Lewis slammed both "patriotic"
antagonists of new art and intellectuals who sacrificed creative
independence at the government's behest. But as we've seen, he too
"exploited blood," using evidence of German atrocities to promote
modernism. That such contradictory negotiations recur repeatedly in
<I>Blast</I> 2 demonstrates not just opportunism or hypocrisy, however,
but also design: they map the dynamics of Vorticism's two-front war
against Germany and <I>pass&eacute;ism.</I> Accordingly, <I>Blast</I> 2
featured polemics deploying propaganda tactics alongside others animated
by dissent. We can assess that dissension through <I>Blast</I>'s responses
to two questions especially pressing for British intellectuals priding
themselves on their political commitment and cultural scope: how to
justify war against Germany, and how to evaluate German culture in light
of war. The answers indicate that the Vorticists believed it possible to
support the national cause while resisting the official explanation. In
their view, indeed, this paradoxical strategy was the necessary means
to realize the Vorticists' project.

<P>
Despite its popularity, the British government's Manichean account of
the conflict was disputed by a small number of dissenting writers of
varying political persuasions. The most controversial such polemic of
the early war was George Bernard Shaw's "Common Sense About the War," a
supplement to the <I>New Statesman</I> of 14 November 1914. In keeping
with his reputation as socialist gadfly, Shaw rejected the official line
that a Good England was morally obligated to defeat an Evil Germany,
arguing that both nations were ruled by Junkers and militarists bent on
exploiting the poor. Still, he defended the socialist cause in terms as
ethically polar as those of the war propagandists:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Will you now at last believe, O stupid British, German, and French
patriots what the Socialists have been telling you for so many years:
that your Union Jacks and tricolors and Imperial Eagles . . . are only
toys to keep you amused, and that there are only two real flags in the
world henceforth: the red flag of Democratic Socialism and the black
flag of Capitalism, or the flag of God and the flag of Mammon?
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Recognizing, nonetheless, that war against Germany had effectively
suspended the war for socialism, Shaw concluded that the former
conflict would have to be resolved before the latter could be resumed:
his rejection of the government's justification as "hypocrisy and cant"
had as its goal not the defeat of the international cartel of capitalist
Junkers and Militarists, as we might expect, but the efficient destruction
of German power: "[W]e in England are ting to shew the Prussians that
they shall not trample on us nor on our neighbors . . . and that if they
are fools enough to make ting efficiency the test for civilization,
we can play that game as destructively as they. That is simple, and the
truth, and by far the jolliest and most inspiring ground to recruit on."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Not all dissident intellectuals embraced Shaw's skeptical militarism,
 however; dissenting members of the Cambridge and Bloomsbury circles
 preferred militant pacifism (<I>AWI,</I> 81-87). Among Bloomsbury
 pacifists, Clive Bell, for example, published the pamphlet <I>Peace at
 Once,</I> which argued that no recourse to international law or power
 politics could justify the conflict. Bell turned against the

<B></B>

government its tale of holy war: in his account, peace becomes the
necessary weapon to defeat the real evil menacing Europe; not Germany:
war itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 In the opening editorial of <I>Blast</I> 2, Lewis too presented himself
 as a dissident, but one unique among leading dissenters. He concurred
 with his radical counterparts in certain respects. Like Shaw, he argued
 that German defeat was a military necessity; like Bell, he contended
 that war could not be justified on moral grounds.

<P>
What distinguished Lewis's analysis, however, was its antagonism to
conventional morality: for him, the conflict's devastation proved not
the senselessness or immorality of war as such, but the human race's
"fundamental" urge to murder and destroy (<I>B,</I> 16). When Lewis
adopted the voice of the dissident, he did so not to evaluate the war's
moral status but to acknowledge its existential reality. He discovered in
it dark and exhilarating truths about human aggression that confirmed the
Vorticists' prewar celebration of vitalizing violence and discredited the
categories of morality on which most arguments about the war, both for and
against, depended. <I>Blast</I> 2 also departed from the official line
on German culture. Whereas support for the war led many to totalizing
dismissals of <I>Kultur,</I> the <I>War Number</I> defended Germany's
artistic achievements even as those expressing similar views grew
silent over time. The war posed a problem for cosmopolitan commentators,
who before the declaration of hostilities had defended German art and
literature, pitting their former devotion to cultural internationalism
against a newfound patriotism. To reconcile these competing loyalties,
such writers often bifurcated German history, distinguishing an older,
better type of "German culture" from a more recent, more dangerous
"Prussian <I>Kultur.</I>"

<P>
One of the Vorticists' closest allies in the intelligentsia, Ford Madox
Ford, had employed the tactic in his anti-German polemic <I>When Blood
Is Their Argument</I> (March 1915), praising "the old-fashioned German
virtues of sentimentality, idealism, and romanticism," while excoriating
the "Prussian State" for spreading "a religion of materialism and of
egotism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Written at Masterman's request, Ford's tract was a rejoinder to Shaw's
 "Common Sense" pamphlet. Predictably, Masterman viewed Shaw's polemic the
 way it came to be pictured popularly, as an unpatriotic, even treasonous
 document. He asked the Anglo-German Ford (then Hueffer) to respond
 to Shaw because of the former's intimate knowledge of Germany. No
 doubt Ford's background put him under particular pressure to verify
 his patriotism by obliging Masterman. At a time of increasing public
 suspicion of "alien enemies"--Germans in England--he could demonstrate
 his national loyalty by answering the government's call to action. But
 that decision would require maligning the nation of his father's birth,
 a nation he had defended until the eve of war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In the end, Ford would choose England over Germany: his particular
 contribution to the propaganda war was a detailed assault on German
 culture, especially those "little, mean, aggressive . . . professors"
 officially deemed the architects of German aggression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P>
Showing loyalty to Ford and the national cause, the <I>War Number</I>
praises <I>When Blood is Their Argument</I> as a "Blast" against Germany
(<I>B,</I> 7). Yet while <I>Blast</I> 2 implies support for Ford's
negative reckoning with <I>Kultur,</I> it does not exactly reiterate
the official denunciation. To be sure, it criticizes Germany, even
divides German

<B></B>

cultural history. But <I>Blast</I> 2 splits Germany along somewhat
unconventional lines, insisting that the official account unjustly ignores
Germany's significant contributions to modern art and literature. The
opening editorial differentiates between "official Germany [that] stands
for . . . Traditional Poetry and the Romantic Spirit" and "unofficial
Germany" (<I>B,</I> 5). Though the citizens of this "unofficial" nation
are never clearly identified, the editorial contends that it had "done
more for the movement" that <I>Blast</I> was "founded to propagate,
and for all branches of contemporary activity in Science and Art, than
any other country" (<I>B,</I> 5). This kind of defense was originally
formulated by a few dissident intellectuals in the war's opening months,
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 but by the time <I>Blast</I> 2 appeared in mid-1915, with battle
 bogging down and the government clamping down on dissent, such praise
 for German culture ran more strongly against English opinion than had
 earlier defenses.

<P>
That a journal so devoted to defending modernism against allegations
of cultural treason would begin with a polemic that invites just those
indictments confirms both the Vorticists' commitment to political and
artistic independence and conviction that such dissent was compatible with
the war against Germany. And as I hope to show, they were more correct
in that contention than has been previously acknowledged. Because
the government enlisted the aid of the intelligentsia in promoting
its official account of the conflict, it helped create a cultural
environment that, insofar as it forbade political and artistic dissent,
authorized expressions of opposition. So by using their talents to resist
Britain's official antimodernist wartime culture, even as they supported
the Allied cause, the Vorticists and their allies managed to produce a
body of literary and artistic works that were at once propagandistic and
experimental, imperialistic and avant-garde, Edwardian and modernist,
and thus further evidence of Vorticism's fulfillment.

Lewis's principal literary contribution to <I>Blast</I> 2 was
the ambitious but incomplete war fiction, "The Crowd Master," an
experimental-realist hybrid that modernistically portrayed British
mobilization on the home front. Like much of the art and literature
featured in the <I>War Number,</I> "The Crowd Master" engaged wartime
life and supported the war cause, but it dissented in its literary
and political approach. Previous accounts have tended to simplify and
totalize this ambivalent, discontinuous, and incomplete text, treating
it as univocally elitist in order to support a reading of the fragment
as protoreactionary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 It is better understood as a work that elucidates the conflicted
 responses of Lewis and his comrades to the huge crowds that rallied
 to support the British cause in late July and early August 1914, and
 the attendant claims of wartime patriotism: fictionalizing Vorticism's
 initial response to the stirrings of war, the story stages a stylistic
 and thematic competition between mass patriotism and avant-garde
 critique, corporate action and intellectual elitism, conformity to state
 narratives and formal experiment. "The Crowd Master" deploys experimental

<B></B>

literary techniques to affirm and interrogate the competing claims of
Vorticist doctrine in wartime.

<P>
Unlike press treatments of the British war crowds, which sought
rhetorically to stir up patriotism and rally public support, Lewis's
rendering in "The Crowd Master" works to analyze mass patriotism. Drawing
on period discussions of "crowd-psychology" like Gustave Le Bon's <I>The
Crowd</I> , the text examines the role of mass behavior in the
rush of popular support that attended war's approach. As historians like
Modris Eksteins and Eric Hobsbawm have shown, the tumultuous days of
late July 1914, with their flurry of ultimatums and mobilization orders,
provoked massive public demonstrations across Europe. These spontaneous
displays surprised many European governments, which had expected greater
popular resistance, and thus played a crucial role in encouraging the
declarations of war that soon followed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Anxieties about such resistance were especially pronounced in England
 due to an all-volunteer military policy, an overdependence on foreign
 imports, and a prewar public mood of unprecedented dissent and agitation.

<P>
Because politicians and members of the press were worried about public
support, even when confronted with overwhelming evidence of it, they
persisted in efforts to rally patriotism. Thus the <I>Times</I>'s
description of the London crowds that gathered in anticipation of war
(on 5 August 1914), emphasizes above all the need for national unity:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Towards midnight Trafalgar square, Whitehall, Parliament street, and
Parliament square were filled with a solid mass of people. The cheering
and singing which had marked the earlier hours of the evening died away
as the hour approached at which the British demand must be answered by
Germany. A profound silence fell upon the crowd just before midnight. Then
as the first strokes rang out from the Clock Tower, a vast cheer burst
out and echoed and re-echoed for nearly 20 minutes. The national anthem
was then sung with an emotion and solemnity which manifested the gravity
and sense of responsibility with which the people regard the great issues
before them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This report encourages the same patriotic "gravity and sense of
responsibility" it describes. Recruitment propaganda disguised as
objective reportage, the piece summons readers to join the mobilized
crowd.

<P>
In comparison, Lewis's treatment of these public demonstrations is
stylistically experimental and analytically penetrating. Evoking the image
of the mobilized crowd in the clipped declarative style of <I>Blast</I>
1's manifestos, Lewis's text moves beyond encouraging national unity to
explain the patriotic willingness to die for one's country:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As Paul Edwards notes, this mini-manifesto on crowd psychology conforms
to period analyses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Following late-nineteenth-century social psychologists like Le Bon,
 Lewis's text defines participation in a crowd as a surrender of
 individuality to an unconscious corporate organism. Describing the
 formation of a "psychological crowd," Le Bon had written that "an
 agglomeration of men presents new characteristics very different from
 those of the individuals composing it. The sentiments and ideas of all
 the persons in the gathering take one and the same direction, and their
 conscious personality vanishes. A collective mind is formed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Drawing on theories like Le Bon's, "The Crowd Master" attends in
 particular to the role of crowd psychology in mass patriotism, arguing
 that the surrender of individuality entailed by participation in a crowd
 is an "anesthetizing" of self that can inspire persons willingly to die
 for country: "the Crowd in Life spells death too, very often. The Crowd
 is an immense anaesthetic towards death. Duty flings the selfish will
 into this relaxed vortex. . . . Wars begin with this huge indefinite
 Interment in the cities" (<I>B,</I> 94). While these words reveal an
 elitist disdain for the unconscious masses and anticipates what recent
 theorists have deemed the fascist unconscious,
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 they also initiate a rather prophetic analysis of the war's
 causes. Viewed in light of the government's rapid conquest of the public
 sphere during the war's opening months, and the attendant spread of
 propaganda and suppression of dissent, Lewis's effort to analyze rather
 than exploit crowd psychology seems an expression less of retrograde
 politics than of suspicion at expanding government control. It is perhaps
 not so surprising, then, that the key finding of Lewis's analysis--that
 wars begin with the gathering of crowds--anticipates the account of
 the Great War provided by today's historians.

<P>
"The Crowd Master" is noteworthy not just because it analyzes rather
than exploits mass patriotism; through its rendering of Blenner, the
soldier-turned-bohemian-egoist, it also portrays the effects of such
patriotism on an oppositional Englishman like Lewis, divided between
loyalty to nation and individual ego. This "retired 1st Lieutenant,"
who now "writes a little, abusively as regards the army," learns of war,
like his creator, while vacationing in northern Britain (<I>B,</I> 95).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 But upon reading the <I>Daily Mail</I> headline that "Germany Declares
 War on Russia," the skeptical Blenner cannot avoid feelings of dread
 and excitement:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
With the words came a dark rush of hot humanity in his mind. An immense
human gesture swept across him like a smoky cloud. "Germany Declares War
on Russia," seemed a roar of guns. He saw active Mephistophelian specks
in Chancelleries. He saw a rush of papers, a frowning race. "&Ccedil;a
y est," thought Blenner, with innate military exultation. The ground
seemed swaying a little. He limped away from the paper-shop, gulping
this big morsel down with delighted stony dignity. [<I>B,</I> 95]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<B></B>
<P>
As Blenner assimilates the earthshaking information with the reserve of
a military professional, feeling exultation and delight at the prospect
of national mobilization. Lewis's fragment responds similarly: fascinated
by the swirl of patriotic activity of Britons being mobilized, it still
wants to maintain critical distance.

<P>
"The Crowd Master" shows this analytical fascination in its treatment
of the type of the dutiful, good-humored, self-effacing British soldier
portrayed in popular war literature. While the "Tommy Atkins" re was
originally idealized by Kipling and others before the century's turn,
younger combatant writers like Herman Cyril McNeile and Ian Hay Beith
venerated the type in their efforts to portray the facts of the Great
War realistically. Their works naturalistically rendered war's trenches,
mud, bullets, death, and the young men who confronted them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 But Lewis's approach to the "Tommy Atkins" re thematized the
 complications of his position as a civilian who had not yet joined the
 ting troops, and as a modern artist trying to maintain commitment
 to artistic and political independence. Blenner's responses to the
 mobilized Scottish coal miners he encounters on the train to London
 epitomize the competition the text enacts between patriotic engagement
 and avant-garde critique. On one hand, Lewis's protagonist sees the
 "pitmen" as embodying Britain's best qualities: "Here were fellows
 to whom he could point to back up his chauvinistic enthusiasm for the
 country, and not doubt their shining and showing handsomely beside any
 man alive" (<I>B,</I> 97). On the other, Blenner admires the Scottish
 reservists because they incarnate the resistant individual immune to
 the claim of crowds: "These Crowd-proof sailors were the first break
 in the continuity of the Crowd-spirit that Blenner had met since war
 began blowing up seriously" (<I>B,</I> 97).

<P>
Confronted with the tumultuous realities of war's opening, Lewis was
pulled, like his ambivalent protagonist, by the competing claims of self
and nation, dissent and patriotism, nonconformity and collectivism. "The
Crowd Master" is an illuminating document of the early war and the
emergence of modernist politics precisely because Lewis did not, as some
maintain, resolve that competition in an unambiguous embrace of the elite
ego. The contention between these claims, thrown into particular relief by
mobilization, fascinated Lewis. He used "The Crowd Master" to portray and
probe it, and by doing so he expressed his vision of Vorticist doctrine in
literary form. Like <I>Blast</I> 2 as a whole, "The Crowd Master" strove
to demonstrate that avant-garde critique was compatible with patriotic
collaboration. As we'll see, by embracing that ideal as an editorial
policy, Lewis also managed to assemble a series of patriotic pictorial
and literary works that, while by no means great, did depart aesthetically
and politically from the pictures and poems sanctioned by the government,
and to that extent appeared (to the Vorticists at least) to demonstrate
<I>Blast</I>'s doctrine of patriotic dissent in art and politics.

<P>
The majority of visual works featured in <I>Blast</I> 2 are formally
comparable to those in <I>Blast</I> 1--dense angular fields of form,
combining modes of abstraction and representation. Most do not engage
the war (many were completed before it began): of

<B></B>

the twenty-five illustrations, only five refer to the war at all, while
just three portray war subjects. This imbalance demonstrates in part
Lewis's claim that war posed no threat to modernism's prewar innovations:
modern art "will be exactly the same after the war as before it," since
"[a]ll art that matters is already so far ahead that it is beyond the
sphere of these disturbances" (<I>B,</I> 13). Yet the inclusion of war
art in <I>Blast</I> 2 also manifests Lewis's editorial commitment to
demonstrate the Vorticists' wartime conviction that modern art could
and should engage the conflict using modernist visual techniques.

To appreciate <I>Blast</I> 2's war art, we need first to recover the
popular war art it opposed, the "weak and sentimentalized reactive" works
assailed in its commentaries (<I>B,</I> 24). Generally speaking, four
types of war art were produced during the conflict's first year: heroic
renderings of traditional military subjects, often drawn from past wars
England had won; allegorical representations of combatant nations or the
ideals at stake; comic caricatures of unsavory German types; and dramatic
renderings of heroic Allied soldiers and victims of German aggression.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The first exhibition of war art, <I>Some Modern War Pictures </I>(New
 English Art Club, October 1914) was aimed at stirring up patriotism and
 helping to recruit volunteers (Britain's military depended on volunteers
 until full conscription was mandated in May 1916).
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 The most common sort of war pictures were allegorical cartoons featured
 in popular journals like <I>Punch.</I> These typically portrayed Germany
 as the diabolical Kaiser being brutal and Britain either as the chubby
 and defiant John Bull or as the British soldier displaying loyalty and
 pluck (<A HREF="4.2peppis_4.html"> 4</A>).

SRC="button/4.2peppis_5b.gif"></A>


Some allegorical artworks sought to discourage class difference and
encourage working-class volunteers, depicting conversations between
the Soldier and the Worker in which the former appealed to the latter's
sense of national duty. Popular journals like <I>Punch</I> also featured
the period's comic pictures, which caricatured the enemy as rigid
militarists, filled with hate and adorned with various accoutrements
of stereotypical Germanness: dachshunds, spiked helmets, beer steins,
and sausages (<A HREF="4.2peppis_5.html"> 5</A>). Lastly,
the period's most serious (and sentimental) posters aimed to recruit
volunteers and solicit material support for the British military and for
Belgian and French refugees by portraying innocent women and children
displaced by German aggression or gallant Allied soldiers resisting it
(<A HREF="4.2peppis_6.html"> 6</A>). The most renowned producer of
this type of poster was the Academy painter Frank Brangwyn, who created
scores of propaganda posters, including one of the first, <I>Britain's
Call To Arms,</I> which portrayed a soldier standing beside Belgian
refugees pointing dramatically toward ruins from which, amidst the
innocent dead, war victims flee.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P>
In his commentaries on art in <I>Blast</I> 2, Lewis assails all these
modes of war art, calling posters and popular art too representational
(<I>B,</I> 47) and modern caricature too literary and naturalistic

<B></B>

(<I>B,</I> 79). He blasts art that is "the ornament and current commentary
of every day life," suggesting that "politically souled" artists who
create naturalistic propaganda pictures at the government's behest reduce
art's function to reflecting the status quo. Arguing against such a
diminution, Lewis calls for an "abstract and universal" art that refuses
"plastic compromise" (<I>B,</I> 72). Accordingly, <I>Blast</I> 2 condemns
especially strongly three leading war artists: R. Caton-Woodville, whose
history paintings it terms inane and formulaic (<I>B,</I> 24); Bernard
Partridge, whose <I>Punch</I> illustrations are assailed for their
"endless tiresomeness and art school neutrality" (<I>B,</I> 79); and
Brangwyn, whose name is first on the list of those blasted (<I>B,</I> 92).

But <I>Blast</I> 2 doesn't just attack popular war art. It also
features artworks that pursue the double war against Germany and
<I>pass&eacute;ism</I> by using techniques of pictorial modernism to
render soldiers in scenes of war: Lewis's <I>Before Antwerp,</I>
Christopher Nevinson's <I>On the Way to the Trenches</I> (<A
HREF="4.2peppis_7.html"> 7</A>), and Jacob Kramer's <I>Types of
the Russian Army</I> (<A HREF="4.2peppis_8.html"> 8</A>). Though
formally dissimilar, these works share the common goal of presenting
a modernist war art: Nevinson's <I>Trenches,</I> like Lewis's
<I>Antwerp,</I> presents itself as a modern war poster, while Kramer's
<I>Types</I> appears a modern war caricature.

<P>
In "Modern Caricature and Impressionism" Lewis describes how modern
war caricatures ought to look. The essay begins by criticizing English
caricature art as

<B></B>

overly beholden to Impressionism and naturalism and goes on to echo
Vorticism's prewar polemics by arguing that the "naturalistic method, with
its atmospheric slop and verisimilitude, makes a drab academic study of
the best notion" (<I>B,</I> 79). The piece deems <I>Punch,</I> England's
major venue for war cartoons, a "national disgrace, from the point of
view of drawing" and praises the late-nineteenth-century caricatures of
Aubrey Beardsley--the only "important re . . . England has produced in
the matter of imaginative drawing in the last generation"--for avoiding
naturalism: "Beardsley's several versions of John Bull would be a good
model to set against the endless tiresomeness and art school neutrality
of some Albion or Lord Kitchener by Bernard Partridge" (<I>B,</I> 79).

<P>
In this light, Kramer's <I>Types</I> appears a modern caricature
that avoids naturalist failings. It rejects "the method employed by
the degenerate Punch cartoonist" of finding a model, dressing up and
posing him, and "carefully cop[ying] the required attitude," instead
portraying three Russian soldiers as freakish, unnatural grotesques: in
the foreground, a large-headed, pigeon-toed midget; in the midground,
a square-headed, hairy-faced cavalry man atop a tiny-legged horse; in
the background, a rail-thin giant wearing a sword. Unlike much popular
war art, Kramer's caricature is not an image to inspire much faith in
Britain's Russian allies or a willingness to die for the fatherland;
in this it shares with the Vorticists a resistance to making art into
government propaganda. Yet at the same time, Kramer's cartoon departs
from Vorticist visual practice and certain political views announced
in the <I>War Number.</I> Though the caricature inhabits a pictorial
landscape occupied almost exclusively by abstract

<B></B>

works, it is, as others have noted, neither particularly abstract nor
Vorticist in pictorial technique (<I>V,</I> 286). And the disjunction
of Kramer's image does not end with its visual style; its anti-Russian
politics too are inconsistent with Lewis's proclaimed support for Russia
(<I>B,</I> 11). By rendering Russians freakishly, Kramer questions the
official government line aesthetically and politically, departing from
the naturalistic conventions of popular war pictures as well as the
pro-Russian policy of the government and established press. The presence
of Kramer's work in <I>Blast</I> 2 confirms a willingness to feature
dissident works even if they departed from the Vorticists' announced
political views or aesthetic practice.

<P>
By including Kramer's <I>Types of the Russian Army,</I> Nevinson's
<I>On the Way to the Trenches,</I> and his own <I>Before Antwerp,</I>
Lewis placed engaged and fairly representational pictures into a body of
artworks primarily abstract and aestheticist, inserted non-Vorticist works
into the propaganda organ of Vorticism, and assembled artworks that voiced
contrasting political views at a time when only one political narrative,
the government's account of the war, dominated public discourse. While
these aesthetic and political inconsistencies have been cited as evidence
of Vorticism's wartime decline, Lewis and his cohorts would have taken
them as indicators of aesthetic and political integrity: in their view,
such diversity measures the intensity of their modernist resistance to
conformity at a time of rigid (artistic) consensus.

<P>
Reading <I>Blast</I> 2's war poems in the context of popular war poetry
suggests that the Vorticists understood them too as demonstrating
the movement's twin aims of patriotic political participation and
modern aesthetic experiment. While a few of the <I>War Number</I>'s
nonpolitical poems have been studied and praised, its war poetry is
generally downplayed or dismissed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Admittedly, when compared to prewar Imagism and the poetic masterpieces
 of high modernism, these sometimes blunt and polemical poems seem
 less aesthetically innovative and historically significant. But
 when the war poems are compared to the occasional poetry produced
 during the conflict's first year, we can begin to understand them as
 the Vorticists would have: as poems engaged in the serious work of
 demonstrating poetically Vorticism's competing commitments to art and
 politics, collaboration and dissent, patriotism and innovation at a
 time of political and poetic conformity.

<P>
Among the most celebrated patriotic poems of the early war are the
"War Sonnets" of Rupert Brooke, the promising young Georgian poet whose
death in April on a boat to Gallipoli nearly coincided with the poems'
publication, thus enhancing both Brooke's stature as English patriot
and the sonnets' stature as major war poetry. We will have reason to
return to Brooke's death and its implications for wartime patriotism
and subsequent readings of Vorticism; for now, the "War Sonnets" will
serve to demonstrate the best that popular English poetry had to offer in
response to the start of war. "The Soldier," for instance, so successfully
re-presents Romanticism's pastoral-nationalist tropes of soil and spirit
and so delicately expresses complicity with the government's agendas of
justifying support for war and encouraging volunteerism

<B></B>

 that it largely avoids the artlessness of most propagandistic poetry
 of the period. Here is sentimental patriotism at its most expressive:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If I should die, think only this of me,
<BR>
That there's some corner of a foreign field

That is forever England. There shall be

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Despite the comparative aesthetic effectiveness of the "War Sonnets,"
however, they demonstrate almost total compliance with government aims:
Brooke may not have signed Masterman's "Declaration of Authors," but
the publication of the "Sonnets" confirmed a comparable willingness to
put his talents at the service of official propaganda.

<P>
The vast majority of popular early war poetry lacks the aesthetic
dimension Brooke imparted to defending the English cause: most is little
more than government propaganda in rhyme that exhorts the public to join
the t either at home or on the front lines by bluntly celebrating
England and the Allied cause, or demonizing Germany, the Kaiser, and
the conduct of the German troops (<I>AWI,</I> 28-33). Typical is
the humorist Barry Pain's "The Kaiser and God,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 which uses the Kaiser's public assertion that "God supported" the German
 army as an occasion to catalogue, in strutting heroic couplets, Germany's
 diabolical crimes:

<P>
In the context of poems like this, the poets of <I>Blast</I> 2
rejected archaic language, heroic couplets, and ballad stanzas. Ford
Madox Ford, for instance, chose free verse and the doctrine of literary
"Impressionism." He had recently described the method in print as "a frank
expression of personality," in which "[t]he Impressionist gives you his
own views, expecting you to draw deductions, since presumably you know the

<B></B>

sort of chap he is."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 If successful, the Impressionist would transmit "the sort of odd
 vibration that scenes in real life really have; . . . giv[ing the]
 reader the impression that he was witnessing something real."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P>
Ford's <I>Blast</I> 2 poem, "The Old Houses of Flanders," works to
fulfill the Impressionist credo by personifying the demise of the old
Belgian houses. It renders war's destruction, if not more "real," then
at least more affecting than any list of atrocities in tetrameter:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
The old houses of Flanders,
<BR>
They watch by the high cathedrals;
<BR>
They have eyes, mournful, tolerant and sardonic, for the ways of men,
<BR>
In the high, white, tiled gables.
<BR>
The rain and the night have settled down on Flanders;
<BR>
It is all wetness and darkness; you can see nothing.
<BR>
Then those old eyes, mournful, tolerant and sardonic,
<BR>
Look at great, sudden, red lights,
<BR>
Look upon the shades of the cathedral
<BR>
And the golden rods of the illuminated rain,
<BR>
For a second . . . .
<BR>
And those old eyes,
<BR>
Very old eyes that have watched the ways of men for generations,
<BR>
Close for ever.
<BR>
The high white shoulders of the gables
<BR>
Slouch together for a consultation,
<BR>
Slant drunkenly over in the lea of the flaming cathedrals.
<BR>
They are no more, the old houses of Flanders.

<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Because it portrays the poet's feelings of personal regret rather than
caricatures of German soldiers, descriptions of war crimes, or accusations
of war guilt, Ford's elegy for Belgian culture distinguishes itself from
much British war poetry in form and content. And when read in light of
his own damning analysis of German culture in <I>When Blood is Their
Argument,</I> the poem suggests that, more than many other journalistic
venues, <I>Blast</I> 2 provided its contributors with a forum to express
heterodox responses to the war.

<P>
It is not so surprising, then, that Lewis chose to include one of the
most unsettled and unsettling dissident poems of the early war: Helen
Saunders's "A Vision of Mud," a discordant, hallucinatory meditation on
mud and poetry in wartime.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Saunders's particular poetic contribution is a restless reverie on the
 urge to bridge the chasm between home and the front in verse, and on
 the ultimate impossibility of doing so. Consistent with <I>Blast</I>
 2's attack on the sentimental realist techniques of war propaganda,
 Saunders's poem uses tropes of poetic naturalism to incite and then
 deny the empathy that propaganda art and poetry is supposed to provide.

<P>
The poem proffers a disorienting series of images evoking facts of
war: recruiting bands, beating drums, struggle, sickness, mud, bodies,
blood, death. It opens somewhat as the conflict did, on a note of
exhilaration. Mud is presented as a medium of

<B></B>

"mighty life": "There is mud all round / This is favourable to the
eclosion of mighty life: thank God for small mercies!" (<I>B,</I> 73)
But the mud turns dangerous, overwhelming, as aggressors try to drown
the speaker:

My eyes are full of it; nose and ears, too.
					[<I>B,</I> 73]</FONT></PRE>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The poem presses us to read its images as representations of front life:
here, a soldier suffocated in trench-mud by the enemy. The gambit recurs
in the poem's first half. A whirl of images invite but never declare
war; one moment a soldier struggles in mud, the next, we hear sounds of
mobilization: "It seems to be a recruiting band, / The drums thud and the
fifes pipe on tip-toe" (<I>B,</I> 73). For the poem's original audience,
it would be difficult not to read such lines as referring to the war.

<P>
Months after the war began, the German government launched a series of
zeppelin attacks on Britain. April and May of 1915 witnessed eight air
raids; bombs rained down on Tyneside, East Anglia, Southend, Leigh,
Westcliff, Ramsgate, and London.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 These often terrifying raids captured English imaginations; so, when a
 "giant cloud like a black bladder with holes in it hovers overhead,"
 pouring mud with "a little red" onto the narrator, remaining doubts
 about the poem's representational and rhetorical aims disappear
 (<I>B,</I> 73). Few Britons could read such lines without recalling
 the deadly airships.

<P>
Yet as the narrator contemplates this rising "black mud" of war, the
poem swerves:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
This mud has curious properties.
<BR>
It makes you dream. It is like poisoned arrows.
<BR>
(Such mud, naturally, is medicinal: that is why they
<BR>
have set up this vulgar "Hydro" here.
<BR>
It is a health-resort.)
<P align="center">
[<I>B,</I> 73]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
By matter-of-factly identifying the poem's mud as that of the
"health-resort," Saunders trips her readers, rebuking those who read
her verse as providing access to the trenches, calling into question
the basic assumptions of such an understanding: that reading about mud
is in any way like being in it, that a mention of mud refers to the
mud of the battlefield, that reading poetry is a political act, a form
of participation in a distant and incomprehensible conflict. As most
English poetry worked insistently to support or render the conflict, "A
Vision of Mud" questions the possibility of that project in a journal
aimed to demonstrate it not only possible but, for modern writers and
artists, necessary. The presence of Saunders's poem in <I>Blast</I> 2,
like that of Kramer's caricature of Russian soldiers, confirms Lewis's
editorial willingness to feature creative works that deviate from the
Vorticist party line.

<B></B>

<P>
As Ford uses verse to lament war's cultural cost, and as Saunders
makes it question the project of writing war poetry, Pound turns it to
protesting the war against modernism. "Et Faim Sallir Le Loup Des Boys"
(<I>B,</I> 22) offers poetry as a tool for rebutting attacks like those
of the radical socialist writer and editor, Alfred Orage. Before the
war, Orage's <I>New Age</I> had been a leading organ for the promotion
and analysis of modernism, publishing and praising works by numerous
radical writers and artists, including Pound and Lewis. Yet Orage's
wartime attacks on Imagism and Vorticism confirm that the conflict led
him to take up arms against modernism. He began the assault in early
September 1914, pronouncing Vorticism "dead": "It was, at best, only a
big name for a little thing, that in the simmering of the pre-war period
suddenly became a bubble, and is now burst."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Orage then reiterated the standard line that modernism was irrelevant
 in wartime: "Compared with the war, [Vorticism] is incomparably feeble."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The polemic reached its greatest intensity in an October assault on
 Imagism, where Orage went so far as to hope that the Imagists might all
 "perish in the war," a wish more theatrically extreme than most found
 in the period's numerous antimodernist polemics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>

<P>
"Et Faim Sallir Le Loup Des Boys" responds by refusing poetically to
abandon the modernist cause. Assailing in particular antimodernist
editors, Pound's narrator defends his closest allies by name, scorning
dreams of dead Imagists:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
<PRE><FONT FACE="Times, Palatino" Size="4">Cowardly editors threaten: "If I dare"
Say this or that, or speak my open mind,
Say that I hate my hates,
	Say that I love my friends,
Say I believe in Lewis, spit out the later Rodin,
Say that Epstein can carve in stone,
That Brzeska can use the chisel,
Or Wadsworth paint;
			Then they will have my guts;
They will cut down my wage, force me to sing their cant,
Uphold the press, and be before all a model of literary decorum.
				Merde!
						[<I>B,</I> 22]
</FONT></PRE><!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This defense resembles popular war poems in its use of poetry as
a medium for polemic and antimodernist polemic in its tendency to
demonize antagonists. But the poem also distinguishes itself from the
generalizations of both genres by asserting its emergence from a nexus
of personal relationships. In its closing tercet, as the narrator faces
war's costs with defiance, the poem turns the besieged (but noncombatant)
modern poet into modernist war hero: "Cowardly editors threaten / Friends
fall off at the pinch, the loveliest die. / That is the path of life,
this is my forest" (<I>B,</I> 22). Acknowledging such costs is not the
same as arresting them, however. Despite the speaker's determined embrace
of artistic exile as the title's starving wolf in the woods, this poetic
defense finally serves to emphasize the dynamic it seeks to resist: by
admitting death into the poem, Pound articulates more powerfully than
most antimodernist

<B></B>

polemics the limits of modern poetry in the face of war. Nonetheless,
because Ford, Saunders, and Pound responded to the call to creative arms
by resisting the conventions of popular war poetry, exploring instead
their personal reactions to war's tumult, they upheld a modernist
commitment to dissenting aesthetics at a time of militant political and
aesthetic consensus. They managed thereby to produce war verse that, while
by no means great, did express poetically the Vorticists' commitment to
engaged dissent.

<P>
The broad dynamic this essay has been tracing, in which Vorticist doctrine
dovetailed with wartime circumstances in such a manner as to authorize
newly that doctrine, achieves its most intense and revealing expression
in "Vortex Gaudier-Brzeska," the central polemical contribution of the
talented young French sculptor whose death in June 1915 cast a chastening
pall over <I>Blast</I> 2. Rather than disputing the scholarly consensus
that Gaudier-Brzeska's death, announced at the end of the polemic,
anticipates and even symbolizes Vorticism's decline or demise during the
Great War, I want to point out that his death wasn't understood by the
Vorticists as merely a confirmation of one or another kind of failure or
loss. On the contrary, "Vortex Gaudier-Brzeska" is the <I>War Number</I>'s
culminating document: it extends Vorticism's program to its theoretical
telos, recording and enacting the glorification of Gaudier-Brzeska,
who by sacrificing his life in the Vorticists' two-front war against
Germany and <I>pass&eacute;ism,</I> provides the ultimate authorization
of Vorticist collaboration and resistance.

<P>
"Vortex Gaudier-Brzeska" recreates in Vorticism's paradoxical image what
George Mosse terms the "myth of the war experience"; it appropriates the
myth's cult of the fallen young soldier, but makes its heroic soldier
a modern artist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Robert Wohl has traced the development of the myth in Britain through
 the case of Brooke, who made the perfect war hero despite the fact that
 the cause of his death was less than heroic (blood poisoning attending
 the clap).
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 For as the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, explained
 in his eulogy, Brooke embodied all the best English qualities required
 for victory: he was "joyous, fearless, versatile, deeply instructed,
 with classic symmetry of mind and body, . . . all that one would wish
 England's noblest sons to be in days when no sacrifice but the most
 precious is acceptable, and the most precious is that which is most
 freely proffered."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 In death, Brooke became a symbol for the generation of young Britons
 that he himself had praised for jumping into battle "as swimmers into
 cleanness leaping."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Wohl shows how Brooke's death validated the national cause, transforming
 him into "a patriotic monument of marble," "an icon in which an entire
 class could recognize itself and by means of which it could justify
 the sacrifice of its sons."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Similarly, by celebrating destruction even while insisting on his
 own--and by extension Vorticism's--invincibility, Gaudier-Brzeska's
 Vortex lays the groundwork for the myth his death would fulfill:
 "WITH ALL THE DESTRUCTION that works around us NOTHING IS CHANGED, EVEN
 SUPERFICIALLY. LIFE IS THE SAME STRENGTH, THE MOVING AGENT THAT PERMITS
 THE SMALL INDIVIDUAL TO ASSERT HIMSELF" (<I>B,</I> 33). The demise of
 this defiant soldier-artist recuperates Vorticism's

<B></B>

contradictory doctrine: his destruction is the final validation of his
cause, transforming him into the heroic and monumental soldier-artist
celebrated on the <I>War Number</I>'s cover, who dies in the t for
modern art and life against Germany and <I>pass&eacute;ism,</I> and in
whom the Vorticists could recognize themselves.

<P>
The Vortex's celebration of annihilation as the fullest proof of manly
life anticipates, perhaps more than any other evidence one could cite
from the early writings of Lewis and his comrades, what has come to be
called fascist modernism. Klaus Theweleit and others have argued that
the German Freikorps texts of the 1920s similarly fetishize the moment
of manly self-sacrifice in the national cause as the ultimate proof of
personal and national vitality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In our context, however, this striking resemblance bolsters the
 argument that during the early months of the Great War, England's
 leading modernist art movement positioned itself as an eager but critical
 collaborator with the British government. The crucial difference in their
 respective doctrines, as we've seen, was the role assigned to modern
 art and letters in the war for a British future. For the government,
 modernism plays a minor role, useful only insofar as its denigration
 validates official art and the official attack on Germany. For the
 Vorticists, in contrast, it plays an essential role; they t for a
 future in which Britannia rules not only waves, markets, and industry,
 but culture as well. As <I>Blast</I> 2 repeatedly insists, only the
 Vorticists, with their recognition that modernity required a culture
 as advanced as it was patriotic, can lead the world's greatest empire
 against the forces of reaction.

<P>
Such policy differences notwithstanding, however, the war revealed a
deeper affinity. Gaudier-Brzeska's sacrificial death, like those of Brooke
and other fallen soldiers across Europe, instantiates the paradoxical
terminus of the prewar cult of masculine vitality that undergirds not
only Vorticism's project of avant-garde imperialism, but the general
ideological edifice of the prewar nation-state system: the ultimate
destruction of vitality as its ultimate affirmation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 This relation calls into further question the still influential
 account of the avant-garde as a progressive--and only somewhat
 successful--antagonist of the nineteenth-century international system
 of bourgeois capitalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Not only does it extend the point Renato Poggioli first made over thirty
 years ago, that the avant-garde was always also a parasitic collaborator
 with that regime,
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 it also suggests that the avant-gardists' neglected investments in
 the imperial politics and nationalistic psychology of the prewar may
 have played as important a role in facilitating their postwar turn
 Right as the optical aesthetics, (latent) anti-Semitism, or elitism
 cited elsewhere.

<P>
Having recovered these lines of collaboration and resistance between
Vorticism and British imperial doctrine during the Great War, and
suggested their significance for our understanding of modernist politics,
we are still left with the question of why these issues tend to get
overlooked or downplayed. Tales of artistic concession and ideological
conversion that dominate accounts of the <I>War Number,</I> I'd suggest,
say as much about us, our politics, and the ways we construe the history
of modernism and its politics, as they do about what Lewis and his
comrades originally said and did. My effort to retrieve Vorticism's
conflicting wartime ambitions and articulate their

<B></B>

entanglement with the aims of British imperialism thus seeks not
only to complicate the familiar tale of the Great War's impact on
Vorticism and the rise of reactionary modernism. I also hope to provoke
some critical reflection on the cultural and political investments we
late-twentieth-century academics bring to the study of modernists whose
politics we don't much like, and the ways those investments have, over
the years, conditioned our evaluations.

The conventional wisdom concerning the poetry of <I>Blast</I> 2 is that
only Pound's "Dogmatic Statement on the Game and Play of Chess" and
Eliot's two early pieces, "Rhapsody on a Windy Night" and "Preludes,"
are worthy of much attention. Pound's piece is usually noted as the
period's only self-consciously Vorticist poem, while Eliot's are cast
as formative texts in the great modernist's career. See, for example,

I used to visit my grandmother, Olivia Shakespear, in London often
when I was a child, while my parents were living in Rapallo, and I
suspect the first time I heard the name of Wyndham Lewis was when
I was nine or ten years old--it meant nothing to me, but I think I
understood that he was the fellow who painted three strange large
vertical panels in bright colors on the wall in her dining room. One
seemed to have the driver's cab as seen from upstairs on a London
double-decker bus at the top, and the same cab upside down at the bottom
(<A HREF="4.2pound_1.html"> 1</A>); the second one (M618) I
ignored; the last one (M619) was a bird with only one wing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 They took up the entire wall behind my grandmother's chair in the
 dining room. The only other Lewis I remember was an ink drawing,
 <I>"D." Sub-section Relief,</I> over the sideboard (M274) facing my
 chair at the table, of men in flat tin hats climbing up a hillside with
 large lumps in the background. I didn't pay much attention to it, and I
 don't think I knew it was a war painting. I never even noticed Lewis's
 drawing of my grandmother (M591) in another corner over a small desk. I
 was much more interested in a large brass barometer, a bowl of ceramic
 artificial fruit (in particular the shiny apple and large black grapes),
 and a flower holder in the shape of a tortoise, nicknamed "Kuraima" by
 the Swami, Yeats's friend and collaborator, who told me that was the
 "Indian" word for a
tortoise. <B></B> I remember the Swami well; he always came to my birthday
party at the flat. He was tall, with a large pink turban and flowing
robes, and walking down Kensington High Street with him enchanted me. I
remember counting the eight lumps of sugar he put in his tea whenever
he visited. By this time I was used to exotically dressed friends and
incomprehensible decorative panels.

<P>
My first meeting in 1948 with the real WL was entirely different. I had
just begun studying Persian and Islamic history at the London School of
Oriental and African Studies (S.O.A.S.). I often saw WL at Agnes Bedford's
cottage near Sloane Square. He would be sitting hunched up in an armchair
in her living room, always wrapped up heavily in rugs and wearing an eye
shade. He was by then almost totally blind and complained constantly of
the cold despite the stifling heat from the gas stove in Miss

<B></B>

 Bedford's tiny room and objected to any strong lighting from any
 direction, fearing it might hurt his eyes. She would either read to
 him or he would dictate to her. They were always working on his next
 book--I never knew which. Mrs. Lewis ("Froanna") would bring him over
 to the cottage in a taxi from Notting Hill Gate, then leave Agnes to
 work with him, often through most of the afternoon. If I arrived too
 early I would wait in the equally small dining room, the walls covered
 with drawings and paintings by WL, Etchells, and others, until they
 had finished, and then Agnes would prepare tea. Often we would return
 to the sitting-room to find WL snoring--work fatigued him, requiring
 great concentration, but when he came to he always had a beatific smile
 and was full of wit and linguistic humor.

<P>
I also visited him on occasion at his Notting Hill Gate flat, which
one reached along a dark narrow passage leading to the front door,
which opened directly into his crowded sitting-room. He had a large
armchair right next to the gas fire, still with a scarf, a thick rug
on his lap, and wearing his large eyeshade. Behind his chair was his
drawing of their dog, "Tut" (M730). The room was crammed with books, and
where there was space he had a couple of colored reprints of Rowlandson
cartoons on the walls.

<P>
He frequently asked me about my courses at S.O.A.S. and why I was
taking them. I told him I wanted to write a history of Persia; he asked
me, "Why?" I gave some sort of answer, which he capped with another
"Why?" I vaguely recall at least five or six "Whys?" This was perhaps
his most valuable gift to me--asking, "Why?" so persistently, but never
antagonistically. He really wanted to know.

<P>
On one occasion when I visited him there we got into a discussion of
what kinds of candies they had on the moon--"Moonies, of course," said
WL. This sort of frivolity was common with him, and on occasion he would
ask me to sing a well-known music-hall song or ballad, which seemed to
tickle him. He wanted the words--but obviously already knew the ballads
and just wanted to hear them again.

<P>
From time to time WL became very restless in his old flat and had to
move. One of these moves was to a temporary room nearby in Notting Hill
Gate, which he used for work. It was a small room with minimal furniture
but packed with bookshelves. My job was to help him sort and shelve
his books, so he could remember where they were. We had quite involved
discussions as to which authors would like to be next to each other. I
recall quite a lot of books were on religion and philosophy. On another
occasion he moved to a fairly spacious flat on Victoria Street, near
the station, again taking many of his books with him.

<P>
In 1951 WL wanted to go to Ireland to join Froanna, who was staying
with old friends outside Cork. Agnes suggested that I get leave from
my classes at S.O.A.S., which I did, from my elderly professor of
Persian, Darab Khan, who approved of me accompanying a blind man. WL
and I travelled by train to Fishguard in Wales to catch the overnight
boat to Cork. On the train we met a vociferous Welshman, possibly a lay
preacher or clergyman--in any case, with my head full of Islamic history,
I dissented on the Resurrection or some such theological issue. I can't
remember who won--almost certainly neither!

<B></B>

<P>
WL loathed being helped in any way, and getting him up and across the
gangplank and on board was extremely difficult. The nurse attached to
the ship's company and I had considerable trouble navigating--especially
since he insisted on hooking his stick around the handle of his suitcase
to prevent it being stolen. Once on board I remember being embarrassed
because he kept saying to the nurse, "I suppose you want a tip for helping
me"--still hooking his walking-stick around the handle of his suitcase.

<P>
When moving anywhere, especially through doorways, WL always ducked his
head and almost doubled up each time, which made accompanying him through
doors and along low narrow passageways difficult. Eventually we got him
into his small but adequate cabin--considerable juggling needed--having
to explain our every move--where the door handle was, and how to find
the toilet. I was in a cabin nearby.

<P>
I joined him again the following morning for breakfast where he insisted,
in his very clear voice, that I describe everyone around me--asking such
questions as "Is she pretty?" of a woman sitting nearby, wanting me to
describe her hat in detail--most embarrassing for me at that age.

<P>
Froanna and a friend met us and somehow we got WL into a car and went
to the old house Froanna was staying in. It was large, reputedly either
the origin of Dickens's <I>Bleak House</I> or where he wrote it--I never
knew which.

<P>
Now, with others to care for him, I was given my freedom--I borrowed
a bicycle, cycled into Cork and along the coast, enjoying the change
from London.

<P>
One day WL suggested that I go to Dublin to visit Georgie Yeats--so off I
went by train, not knowing then that Georgie had been one of my mother's
oldest and closest friends. I think the address was 46 Palmerston Road. My
chief recollection of her was that she had a large purplish face and was
extremely kind. At the time I didn't know anything of her long connection
with Olivia, my parents, or that at one point during the war Georgie
had suggested that I be sent to Ireland to escape the bombings in London.

<P>
When back in Cork, WL suggested I buy myself an overcoat--clothing still
being rationed in England--so I bought an Irish tweed coat.

<P>
The return trip with WL and Froanna was equally trying, but at least I no
longer had the major responsibility of steering him on and off the ship
and train. When we got to customs in Fishguard there was some confusion
because WL refused to go into the customs shed. I think the ceiling
seemed too low to him and he was afraid of banging his head. This was
resolved and we returned to London.

<P>
I enjoyed WL's company despite the embarrassing moments and his constant
asperity--his humor, directness, and imagination always appealed to me.

<P>
On finishing my year at the S.O.A.S. I went off to the University of
Tehran on an Iranian government scholarship--and my only news of him
was via letters from Agnes and my parents in Washington, D.C.

<P>
Our next meeting was in the summer of 1955 when Elizabeth and I went
to England on our honeymoon. On one occasion Froanna and WL invited us
to an enormous, superbly cooked dinner in the flat with champagne, a
necessity for WL. Froanna was an exceptional cook--cordon bleu in caliber.

<B></B>

<P>
On another occasion I took some of WL's books that I had picked up
secondhand and asked him to sign them for both of us, which he did. I
remember Froanna instructing him exactly where to sign them, saying, "Sign
there, that will make them more valuable." I felt uncomfortable, having
never asked anyone to sign anything for me before. All in all I think
Elizabeth and I visited them three or four times--the last times I saw WL.

<P>
At the end of 1956, when I was still at McGill University, we arranged
with Fortnum and Mason, the best food store in London, to send WL and
Froanna a small box of marrons glac&eacute;s, one of WL's favorite
delicacies, for Christmas. For some reason Fortnum couldn't find his
flat so the box was not delivered for Christmas--and when it finally
arrived in January, Lewis was dead.

<P>
A few weeks later I wrote a memorial ditty for WL, which I sent to Agnes;
it was not poetry, but what I felt at the time.

In the first paragraph of "The Meaning of the Wild Body" , Wyndham
Lewis sets out the major premise for his mature theory of comedy. This
entails an axiomatic, apparently inarguable separation between the
object of comedy and its laughing observer, between the Wild Body and
its percipient:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
First, to assume the dichotomy of mind and body is necessary here,
without arguing it; for it is upon that essential separation that the
theory of laughter here proposed is based. The essential us, that is,
the laugher, is as distinct from the Wild Body as in the Upanisadic
[<I>sic</I>] account of the souls returned from the paradise of the Moon,
which, entering into plants, are yet distinct from them. Or to take the
symbolic vedic re of the two birds, the one watching and passive,
the other enjoying its activity, we similarly have to posit <I>two</I>
creatures, one that never enters into life, but that travels about in a
vessel to whose destiny it is momentarily attached. That is, of course,
the laughing observer, and the other is the Wild Body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This uncompromising dichotomy appears at odds, however, with Lewis's
attitudes in a contemporary treatise, "Inferior Religions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Here the "Wild Body" is "regarded as a brain" and

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
laughter [as] the brain-body's snort of exultation. It expresses its
wild sensation of power and speed; it is all that remains physical in
the flash of thought, its friction; or it may be a defiance flung at
the hurrying fates.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The Wild Body is this supreme survival that is us, the stark apparatus
with its set of mysterious spasms: the most profound of which is
laughter. [<I>WB,</I> 152]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
No superior or derisive sneer, laughter here wells up from the very
source and matrix of the laughable. Although Lewis seems equally to root
his laughter in the Wild Body and laugh his
way

<B></B>

 out of that vibrating corpus, he stands as no credible witness at a comic
 marriage of brain and blood. For he scores his doubts too deeply into
 these essays--into their conceptual fabric, into the very rhetorical
 textures of these passages: the re of the souls returning to the
 plants in the Upanishadic account, for example, is poised with suspicious
 ambivalence between entry and abeyance.

<P>
The contrary positions Lewis assumes in these essays may reflect
a generic or typical division in modern ideas of the comic, which
have focused variously on the internal or psychological dimensions of
laughter and its external, mechanical occasions. His preoccupation with
the nature and character of the laugher resonates with Sigmund Freud's
interest, in <I>Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious,</I> in the
laugh as an unleashing of forbidden energies. And his fixation on the
comic object of the Wild Body matches Henri Bergson's focus, in <I>Le
Rire</I> (Laughter), on the risible automaton, the primary scene of
comedy. These several interests may testify to the comprehensive scope
of Lewis's engagement with the comic, but their differing interests do
not explain away the inconsistency here: the uneasy shift in positional
relation between the target of humor and the laugher's vantage. There is
an uncertainty about the proper comic response that we may understand
as a vacillation between an experience of the <I>ludicrous</I> and
a sense of the <I>ridiculous:</I> between a spirit of play, in which
<I>homo ludens</I> happily joins with the wild body of the laughable,
and a spirit of ridicule, where the observer distances and chastises
the mechanical object of laughter but does not redeem or reclaim it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
This double measure of ludic participation and satirical rebuke has only
been obscured by the re of the Enemy, the professional antagonist,
which Lewis projected so strenuously as his public persona in his
middle years and put forward as his literary identity in <I>Satire
and Fiction</I> . There is indeed a richness of texture in his
comic texts that is informed by a self-division that the Enemy could not
admit. Now, these rival attitudes might be assimilated to some standard
critical counter like "generative tension" or "creative opposition," but
they are understood better, more usefully and substantively, as a residue
of contrary stages in his development. His movement from reciprocity
with the comic object to judgment of it turns on a moment of political
recognition that gives the difference between early and later Lewis its
fullness of intellectual implication. This moment stands as a watershed
in his literary-intellectual career, and I wish to define and recover
its importance here. I center it in the second of the three sections
that follow, where I show the profound reorientation it represents by
searching more deeply into the samples and model of early comedy that I
set out in the first section. The difference this political perception
makes will then be seen, in the third section, in the revision the older
Lewis makes of his earlier work.

<P>

<H3><!--_a-head-->
<B>I</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The variable in Lewis's comic theory and practice lies in the positional
character of the laugher, not in the nature and behavior of the comic
object, and so it seems

<B></B>

 best to begin with that constant: to redraw Lewis's image of the Wild
 Body and note its comic properties and precedents. The most influential
 model is surely Bergson's. After all, Lewis attended the lectures
 Bergson offered at the Coll&egrave;ge de France in 1903,
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 and the recent publication of <I>Le Rire</I>  had established
 its idea of the comic as a prevailing convention. It was this idea
 that Lewis carried with him through Brittany and Spain--in travels that
 would provide material for his first attempts at literary fiction, the
 stories he drafted and published in England in 1909 and 1910.

<P>
Bergson sees the classic incidence of comedy as involving a collision
between the mechanical and the organic, the habitual and the
variable. Thus the absent-minded man, who has reduced his walking to
involuntary routine, slips risibly on the unseen banana peel. The changing
demands of life reveal a habitual pattern for what it is, and the mirth
is earned at its expense. The laughter entails more than perverse delight
in such contretemps, however; it exercises a high Aristotelian function,
Bergson suggests, for it identifies the fool, rebukes the automaton,
and purges the nonperson, the thing, from proper society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Yes, humans may revert to the lower level of mechanical life, but
 Bergson's comic philosophy clearly regards such descents as mere dramatic
 opportunities, as incidents to trigger and set in motion a whole economy
 of redemptive laughter, which returns the audience to the true norm of
 the flexible, thinking response. That is a profoundly humanist norm,
 after all, for it measures and celebrates a human superiority to the
 lower, animal-mechanical character.

<P>
It is remarkable that the tradition of critical inquiry into Lewis's
appropriation of Bergson has failed uniformly to note this defining
difference--all the more remarkable in view of the fact that Lewis sets
the anti-Bergsonian temper of his early stories in the clear theoretical
frame of his later treatises, which he published with the revised version
of those stories in 1927.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Here Lewis reverses the value and strategy of the Bergsonian formula:
 "The root of the Comic is to be sought in the sensations resulting from
 the observations of a <I>thing</I> behaving like a person" (<I>WB,</I>
 158); the mechanical thing defines the <I>essence</I> of Lewis's
 character, not simply a provisional, farcical identity. This comedy
 laughs at the pretence to humanity, the imitation of personhood by its
 inveterate inferiors; the very humanist vantage assumed by Bergson
 is here the butt of laughter. Lewis's comic characters are not some
 subnormal exception; they comprise a usual humankind, whose strenuous
 but vacuous attempt to supersede their animal-mechanical nature affords
 the constant opportunity for comedy. Lewis expresses the antihumanist
 philosophy that generates this perception as the passage about "the
 root of the comic" continues, elaborating its basic premise in typical
 mise-en-sc&egrave;nes:

<P>
To say, as Geoffrey Wagner does, that Lewis's "comic type is the human
being lacking in awareness, guilty of Bergsonian 'distraction,' and
approximating to the animal machine,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 is to miss the whole point of this radical rewriting. For Bergson's comic
 percipient takes an Aristotelian high ground, noting the anomaly of the
 mechanical person and restoring the proper human value by laughing at
 the mistake; the pretence of such human superiority becomes the target
 of Lewis's comic disdain--the animal's humorous impersonation of free
 and thinking humanity.

<P>
There is an anatomy of folly in Lewis's oeuvre, a tendency to see certain
sensory aspects of the human creature as particularly susceptible to the
mechanisms of comedy. His inclination points to backgrounds in French
intellectual history that may be usefully rehearsed here. This is the
post-Revolutionary tradition of <I>id&eacute;ologiecritique.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 This quasi- or semiscientific method takes the body as primary locus
 for adducing truths about the human creature and uses these axioms as
 bases for the formulation of political principle. This discourse was
 being carried on at Lewis's own moment in France by Remy de Gourmont,
 whose analyses, compounded shortly afterward by Julien Benda, routinely
 identified the senses of sound (speech as well as hearing) and sight
 as demonstrations of opposite human possibilities and political
 values. In this description the eye relies on distance and separation
 from the object in view, while the ensuing clarity of focus induces
 a mental condition favoring clear conceptual definition and detached
 understanding; instrument and emblem of intellectual superiority, the
 eye validates the whole notion of social hierarchy. Hearing, by contrast,
 requires contact between the auditor and the physical stimulus; incapable
 of detached intellectual activity, the ear processes the content it
 has received merely by repeating it, verbatim, through the mouth: the
 auditory type becomes one with the sound. The fusion or empathy enabled
 by this process defines its political valence: the less discriminating
 members of the body politic are open to this lower channel of sensory
 communication--an audience bound first to sound and then to each other
 in a spurious but formidable unity, a demotic solidarity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The political import of this construction may await our consideration in
 the second section, but it is already easy to see how this understanding
 of sound may cast the primary character of comedy. The re of an
 acoustic fool, blithely and mechanically repeating the sounds dubbed
 into him, is the automaton set up for a comic fall.

<B></B>

<P>
The fall shows its peculiarly Lewisian spin right from the start, in
his first published story, "The 'Pole'" . Here the tale-teller
Isobletsky has listened to himself recite his account and is now locked
into the several speaking mannerisms to which he has reduced it; his
own character in the adventure has become an aural impression to be
duplicated. A tissue of impersonations, an overlay of echoes, he depicts
the <I>habit</I>ual, rote repetition to which aural reception inclines. By
the time the narrator meets him, he shows

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the strangest <I>habit</I> of imitating his own imitations. In telling
a story in which he red (his stories were all designed to prove his
independence) he had a conventional type of imitation for the voice
and manner of his interlocutor, and a gruff, half-blustering tone to
imitate his own voice in these dramatic moments. And gradually these
two tones, mixed into each other, had become his ordinary tone in
conversation. [<I>WB,</I> 213; emphasis added]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Isobletsky's claim to "independence" as a protagonist in these tales
comes into sharp and revealing contrast with the mechanical character of
his utterance: the irony here tracks Lewis's own classic comic incident,
where the target of laughter lies in the assumption of human superiority
over such automatic life. Thus Lewis mounts his challenge to the humanist
philosophy of Bergson from a distinctively Gourmontian ground; the heavy
mechanisms of aural habit exert a force like gravity here, acting as
counterweight to the auditor's unsuccessful but laughably strenuous
efforts at transcendence.

<P>
The comic agon in "A Breton Innkeeper"  develops similarly. Roland,
the concierge-dictator, inveighs thus against the boy-auditor, his
assistant:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He rages often, cries <I>nom de Dieu,</I> stamps and fumes when the
aforementioned youth does something that displeases him. And doubtless
there is some <I>nuance</I> in this that touches the brass-buttoned
boy--doubtless there is in that youth's exquisite instinct for Roland many
a shade in the rough voice imperceptible to a stranger--some inflection
that makes him scamper more hastily about his business. But outwardly
it is the same heavy and desperate geniality. [<I>WB,</I> 269]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The youth is driven by aural signals as compelling but uncomprehended as
a dog-whistle; such reflex response and mechanical behavior enact the
truth of de Gourmont's own aper&ccedil;u: the ear is unfree, incapable
of detachment from its own network of rote, determinate response. Nor
is the speaker Roland a straight man to this comic mechanism: his
character-in-voice is no less manic and inalterable than the boy's,
for Lewis prefaces the account of his speaking style with this generic
identification: "I have never seen him forsake his farcical manner
with anyone" (<I>WB,</I> 269). There may be some pronominal confusion
between the speaker and auditor in the last sentence here--whose
"heavy and desperate geniality" is it?--but this uncertainty resolves
itself into a single debility, into the one comic opportunity of ear
and mouth. Whether it is the boy or Roland, the automaton pretends an
independence more risible

<B></B>

than his ostensible slavery. He reaches toward a higher level of human
polity and social decorum, but lurchingly, comically, as the phrasing
suggests: his "heavy and <I>desperate</I> geniality" speeds up the very
mill of driven behavior he is seeking to outrun.

This paradox of mechanical vitality shows its somber
gusto in the visual language of the 1912 <I>Courtship</I> (<A
HREF="4.2sherry_1.html"> 1</A>). Here the male and female res
are curvilinear, lithe, thus idealizing the elementary energy of their own
instinctive ritual; true to the ironic pattern, their thighs and upper
torsoes bulge to a muscle-bound puppetry, and so depict their owners as
chthonic automatons, dancing in grim compliance with the determinate laws
of life. Bergson's <I>&eacute;lan vital</I> runs down into self-mocking
robotics, and Lewis adds his comic touch in allowing one of these res
to pretend some superiority over her mechanical condition: the head angled
demurely to the side affects a human shyness, a self-consciousness out
of keeping with the machine, with behavior compelled by instinct. But
not entirely so. Such courtship is a ritual, after all, and the head
display is really no free play at all, for it is working in a fashion
as grim and driven as the rest of her bodily bulk. The image of superior
freedom it affects is really the focus and butt of humor here.

<B></B>

<P>
But it is the circuit of aural-oral compulsion that provides Lewis's
main comic occasion. Thus the narrator-<I>far&ccedil;eur</I> of "Le
P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois"  fiddles with his victim's throat:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
After having been shown his throat, and having vainly attempted to seize
between my thumb and forefinger an imaginary vessel that he insisted,
with considerable violence, that I should find, our relations nearly
came to an abrupt termination on my failing, and having, indeed, pursued
song athwart his anatomy to its darkest and most lugubrious sources, I
said irrelevantly that his hair was very long. He slowed down abruptly
in his speech, but some sentences still followed. Then, after a silence,
taking suddenly the most profoundly serious expression, he said, with a
conviction of tone that admitted of no argument and paralysed all doubt,
"I will tell you! It's too long! My hair is too long!" [<I>WB,</I> 278]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The mystery organ in the depths of this "florid aperture" of the
mouth is the source and center of acoustic vitalism, an energy running
according to those laws of <I>&eacute;lan m&eacute;canique</I> so richly
evidenced in the other early stories. Having had the vitalist innards
of his throat tickled and stimulated, Francis duly produces the sort
of rote, determinate reaction that vocal energy typically runs to:
the Franciscan merely repeats the phrases imprinted into him by the
narrator-protagonist. When he claims these words as his own--"<I>I</I>
will tell <I>you</I>"--he is of course reversing the real current
of influence; thus he takes the wheel of farce one turn further, and
completes the scene with Lewis's own distinctive flourish: the ultimate
moment of comedy is a character's attempt to pretend superiority over
his own determinate nature--the paces of aural habit through which this
vibrant songbird has just been put.

"The higher the slavery, the more exquisite the buffoonery":
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 the truth of Shaftesbury's elegant conceit is borne out by the deftness
 of Lewis's lampoons, for this <I>far&ccedil;eur</I> also reveals an
 intoxication with the object of laughter. At moments in his early work,
 one finds the signs of an infatuation with the musical and vocal culture
 of the same Breton speakers he otherwise burlesques. Such attraction
 instances a prime type of acoustic empathy. To its considerable appeals
 Lewis produces a mixed response, modifying his enchantment with an
 emergent recognition--and resistance. He is coming to regard this musical
 sympathy as an experience replete with the psychological and political
 meanings so richly detailed in the contemporary European analysis of
 the subject. (There is simply no evidence that Lewis knew de Gourmont's
 work before beginning to write the stories; the very progressive and
 dialectical character of the recognition I am about to outline, indeed,
 suggests persuasively that he had no prior knowledge. The work of the
 contemporary <I>id&eacute;ologues</I> comprises an awareness into which
 he moves, at least initially, on his own.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 While Lewis's struggle clarifies the terms of that continental discourse,
 and claims its relevance to his

<B></B>

own nascent model of comedy, his divided attitudes will be most
interesting when they end, as an ambivalence overcome. Once he recognizes
the social manifestations of aural empathy, that is, the idea of musical
fellow-feeling generates a distaste that annuls all ambiguity. His angle
of relation to his comic object shifts, accordingly, from a more playful
and reciprocating one, grounded in a strong sense of the ludicrous, to an
attitude of detached ridicule and a concomitant vision of the ridiculous.

<P>
A travel diary fragment written at Quimperl&eacute; in 1908 (preserved
at the Cornell archive) records Lewis's elementary fascination
with the Breton tongue. His sympathy is as articulate as it is
discriminating. Sifting through an interlingual hubbub on the quays, he
concentrates on the local dialect, which sounds out its own version of
the Burkean sublime. It creates a beauty as severe as fear--a mingled
and compelling chime:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Several groups of Sweedish [<I>sic</I>] sailors from the boats and
breton dock hands were working on the quay, and the harsh celtic
tongue, passionate and abrupt, was mixed with the wearisome drawl of the
scandinavians. Certain languages,--Russian, swedish, breton,--apart from
the distinct sound of them, are spoken with a distinct tone of voice.
<BR>
. . . Breton is a solemn, rude, patriarchal, monotonous tongue, with long
 and sudden bursts of wild, impetuous speech, with sentences coming to a
 dead halt, which is not a breaking off as it seems, but the excited pitch
 of the voice is kept up till the last syllable and so there is no drop of
 the voice at the end of the phrase; there seems to be a ring of joy--not
 benevolent,--and recklessness, hysterical, timbre drawn out, and then
 sudden harsh and trenchant tones, and grating emphasis. [<I>WB,</I> 197]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Acoustic sensation at this pitch of intensity is felt along the pulse of
a fundamental life-force, various European commentators were suggesting,
and thus joins its auditor in empathy with an <I>&eacute;lan vital.</I>
The same vitalist currents drew Lewis into the thrall of Bretonic aural
culture, he would reveal four decades later, when its vibrancy seems
inseparable from the stupefaction it induced in him:

The passage offers its mixed attitudes like the palimpsest of a forty-year
career, yet it also provides a remarkably accurate replica of an original
complexity. Its peculiar combination of attraction and censure, both
glorifying and objecting to the vitalism with which Lewis had moved in
elementary sympathy, describes a counterrhythm

<B></B>

already strong in the early fiction, where it emerges less discursively,
more dramatically, as the function of an open-ended, dialectical inquiry.

<P>
This counterrhythm of resistance and reciprocity with Bretonic vocal
culture moves at first as a function of Lewis's response to its sublime
aspect. Its severe economy of beauty and terror discovers a <I>locus
classicus</I> in "The Death of the Ankou" (probably the first of Lewis's
attempts to fictionalize his experience in Brittany), where the English
narrator recounts and responds to a primitive death fetish. Whereas
Lewis would later attribute this story to sources of vitalist energy in
Brittany, to the "sun, a Breton rather than a British" sun,
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 the death fetish emerges narratively and dramatically out of the vitalist
 <I>sounds</I> of the place--a vocal hubbub drenched in the sharp
 life-blood of the locale, an acoustic milieu as stark and compelling
 as the object it generates:

sharpening itself on caustic snarling words, would soar to a paroxysm of
energy. "Garce"! [Bitch!] was the most frequent sound. All the voices
would clamour for a moment together. It was a shattering noise in this
dusky tunnel.--I had stopped reading, as I have said, and I lifted my

The Ankou embodies not only the vocal culture of the place but the
double measure of its acoustic sublime, moving not by eyesight but an

<P>
Behind this curtain of terrible splendor, rather like the Wizard of
Oz's, stands a pair of all too human feet, a local beggar's, and the
little joke of this reversal goes to the larger sense of comedy that
Lewis inscribes in the tramp's name: Ludo. The sense of play in this
environment--"the <I>play</I> was in progress," after all, when the Ankou
appeared--captures an ethical value within its theatrical meaning. In this
primitive culture, the drama of death (and life) is a game, a sport no
less severe than boisterous but at all points a collective engagement,
a playing <I>tout ensemble:</I> Ludo emerges from voices in "clamour
. . . <I>together.</I>" And Lewis signs this re of play into a type
and model of comedy as he assigns Ludo an exact double and counterpart
in the <I>far&ccedil;eur,</I> through this fisherman's anecdote:

The English <I>far&ccedil;eur</I>'s blindness may be taken to typify
Lewis's openness to the sounds of the warm vitalist <I>cultus</I> of his

unexpected values and emphases in his earliest model of comedy: a playful
synergy with the very characters of acoustic vitalism that provide his
farcical types.

<P>
Such reciprocity is the theme in Lewis's recreation of the comic economy
in "Les Saltimbanques" . Here the performing troupe provides a
paradigm of the comic occasion and a definition of the author's relation
to his comic object (and audience), the wild body of the public:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
They looked upon the public as a vast beast, with a very simple but
perverse character, differing from any separate man's, the important trait
of which was an insatiable longing for their performances. . . . Whenever
they met one of these monsters ["the many-headed beast"]--which was on an
average twice a day--their only means of escape was by charming it with
their pipes, which never failed to render it harmless and satisfied. They
then would hurry on, until they met another, when they would again play
to it and flee away.

The reflection that all these people parted with their sous for so
little would be the only bright spot in the gloomy Adrien Brower of
their minds. They felt that they were getting the better of them in some
way. That the public was paying for an idea, for something that it gave
itself, did not occur to them, but that it was paying for the performance
as seen and appreciated by them, the performers. For it is most difficult
to realise the charm of something we possess. [<I>WB,</I> 237-38]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Once again a pronominal confusion--here in the last several
sentences--serves Lewis's theme perfectly: an exchange of roles, in
which the audience plays music to the performers. Sounding the audience's
response back to itself, Lewis's performers seal the network of acoustic
empathy that binds all together. The author's own incipient resistance
to such exchanges leads him to give the upper hand here to his players,
who can pretend that, even while they are being paid for performing,
they are the ones enjoying the show.

<P>
Yet the performers' complicity with the crowd reflects the inexorable laws
of physical attraction and bonding between sound and listener and, as
expressed, signals Lewis's own fascinated discovery of these rules. For
his narrative modulates into semidiscursive rhythms, inscribing sympathy
through sound--speech no less than music--as the constant, necessary
principle of such performances:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
it is the public . . . towards whom the discomfited "swell" in evening
dress turns as towards his peers, for sympathy and understanding, when
"scored off" anew, in, as the simile would affirm, this low-bred and

that was being represented in the dialogue, and constantly discomfited,
and he were merely their mouthpiece.

<P>
To hear these exchanges between performer and audience as a protopolitical
event is to exercise a Bendian hermeneutic that Lewis's language and
imagery here amply invite. Thus Demos, a "low-bred" creature, is reached
at the lowest sensory level through sound; musical empathy underlies
and directs the very collective behavior that constitutes "the Crowd,"
"the public." While these scenes hint consistently at such a political
insight, however, their social content is most interesting in remaining
implicit, unformulated. It is as though the narrative consciousness,
struck by the perplexity of its own fascinated revulsion at the music
of local speech, is evolving this social analysis to sort out that
paradox. For this political reading, which occurs to Lewis only as a
suggestion, emerges obliquely, tentatively, as a function of his own
divided response to the Bretonic vocalese. While the insight lingers on
one side of the narrative consciousness, he does not look at it directly.

<P>
Lewis sees it steady and whole a year later, in the last of his
continental stories, "Le P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Music was his theme. In making use of certain expressions in the course of
his rambling declamation, such as <I>andante</I> and <I>contralto,</I> he
would add with sudden politeness "that is a term in music." . . . To look
at him one would have said that the only emotion he had ever experienced
was that provoked by the topical and sentimental songs of his country. He
had become a very disreputable embodiment of them. His was the face of
a man who had wedded, and been mastered by, the vague and neurasthenic
heroine of the popular lyrical fancy; from constant intercourse with this
shade he had grown as nearly as he could make himself her ideal. With
his hat stuck over his eyes, his lips in a drunken and insolent pout,
his nose red, and an ironical scowl on his countenance, . . . he turned
in my direction, stretching out the hand with the umbrellas, and began
singing a patriotic song in lusty voice. . . . [H]is discourse [was]
full of what I supposed to be musicians' slang, confounded with thieves'
slang and Breton slang; the hiccups that engulfed so many of his phrases
and often ruined a whole train of thought . . . were only a few of the
disappointments to be met . . . [<I>WB,</I> 277].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Here the empathy proper to the musical response reveals the same psychic
and social mechanism that Benda would describe nearly a decade later. Thus
Francis's fanciful marriage with the heroine of the song, following his
"constant intercourse with this shade," consummates the laws of physical
sympathy fundamental to acoustic experience. Presenting that response as
the femme fatale's "popular draw," moreover, Lewis draws a specifically
political situation. Such empathy through sound is the populist way of
feeling; it also binds the membership of Demos into an acoustic amalgam
and, like the national hymns heard by Benda, generates collective feeling
as a function of its own musical effect. Thus the singer Francis, exuding
the same "lusty" mood that compels his imaginative marriage with the
ballad bride, rides his "patriotic song" into radical union with his
conationals--and it is a lower order of nation, after all, that includes
"thieves' slang" in its national speech.

<P>
Reversing this current of empathic projection but preserving its social
meaning, Francis invites the same populist aggregate to abide within
him: he has "become a giant. . . . [N]ow that he is isolated everything
has come to inhabit him, and he feels

<B></B>

constantly in his spirit the throbbing of multitudes" (<I>WB,</I>
279-80). Thus the modern political phenomenon of demotic gigantism
whirls around an empty center; this vacant intraindividual space craves
such bogus relationships and expansions as musical empathy makes all
too easy and available.

<P>
Remarkable for the new virulence of its depiction of the aural, "Le
P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois" moderates its invective only to serve the
needs of exposition, which links this musical character to the methods
and emblems of demotic solidarity. Once Lewis has recognized the social
meanings of aural empathy, moreover, he exhibits a categorical antipathy
to it. Thus lyrical fellow-feeling provokes a distaste that annuls all of
Lewis's earlier ambiguities about the acoustic experience. Indeed, the
political content of this aesthetic event decisively turns the course
of his development, for "Fran&ccedil;ois" anticipates the substance of
the author's mature social critique.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P>
The difference this political perception makes in the typical
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of Lewisian comedy may be found in a particular
passage in "Fran&ccedil;ois," one that recasts the incident of an
earlier story in view of the political import newly found in the comic
action. (The unitary character of these stories was reinforced by their
appearance in but two magazines: the first three [1909] in Ford Madox
Hueffer's <I>The English Review;</I> the next three [1910] in <I>The
Tramp.</I>) Thus "Fran&ccedil;ois" includes a pointed reference to "A
Breton Innkeeper," the piece published immediately before it. Here Lewis
compares the musical antics of the Franciscan, cryptically but knowingly,
with those of the concierge. Invoking Roland as Francis's "like," the
author gestures at a particular scene in which the innkeeper, seen in
the company of street boys--like Francis in the matching passage--matches
the "ceaseless dramatic effervescence" (<I>WB,</I> 279) of the priest. A
juxtaposition of the two texts shows Lewis angling his later reference
to point up the specifically political nature of Roland's musical antics:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Roland is like one of those "eccentric musicians," as they are called,
that tear about in front of a row of different sized bottles, playing
"Rule Britannia" with inconceivable agility. His perpetual verbosity and
ubiquity are appalling. Rather than relapse into anything approaching
calm, he will talk to his own wife, or to a little ragged boy that has
stopped in the street to stare at the boy in buttons. He is capable of
banging on the back of a saucepan or rattling the dishes to "keep things
going." [<I>WB,</I> 271]

The P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois and his like spend their lives in a
ceaseless dramatic effervescence. Their furious gestures, their dark

and excited little boys, who occasionally take some notice of one in the
streets. The only difference is that the children are conventional and
romantic, whereas his impersonations are often of the most blood-curdling
realism. You will find a beggar ranting in some Paris street, and with
fiery exclamations he will be exciting an imaginary and sanguinary mob
to revolution; or he will lash the watching people with his scorn like
some misunderstood and outraged leader, and, rushing off, will constantly
turn and shout his threats and reproaches at them from afar, as though
he were leaving some doomed city. At the next street corner a fresh
crowd will gather at his eccentric mutterings. [<I>WB,</I> 279]

In a nationalist lyric like "Rule Britannia," the collectivizing effects
of music are channeled to their predictable political ends, but this
theme holds no conceptual focus for Lewis yet. An unclaimed inference,
it is passed over, lost to the very headlong fancy of the simile that
generates it. Two months later, this gay charade has darkened into an
augury of the political truths Lewis has lately and grimly grasped. He
exploits it accordingly. As Francis's "like," then, the formerly
innocuous bottle-player moves as one with this ignorant but sinister
mountebank, and into the arena of real political theater, where the
demagogue's vocal music consolidates the crowd and magnetizes its members
to himself. And that is no laughing--or ludic--matter. The earlier sense
of the ludicrous--a boisterous laughing with the wild body of comedy, a
participatory fun with the comic automaton playing his harmless bottle
music--dissolves into a repugnance at the dangerous political prepotence
of such performance and sympathetic participation: Francis prompts only
disdain; ridicule is the sign and mode of our response.

<P>
The treatises on comedy that Lewis composed later in his career, then,
show the palimpsest-like character of his developed thinking on the
subject: a layering of varied--and conflicting--emphases on vitalist
empathy and satirical distance. It is thus especially interesting to
recover a first tract, a piece written just slightly ahead of the moment
of political perception that would complicate the primary model. This is
an essay published in the <I>New Age</I> in May 1910: "<I>Our</I> Wild
Body." My emphasis here points to its signal difference from "<I>The</I>
Wild Body," where the definite article carries that later strain toward
objectivity and distanced regard. For in May 1910 Lewis still views the
Wild Body as a collective possession and the experience of comedy that it
centers and generates as a game played in common, a sport of the social
<I>corpus.</I> Indeed, this 1910 essay is so borne along by the spirit
of corporate fun that it scarcely steps aside to characterize as humor
the experience it valorizes, but the nature and behavior of the energy
he extols here clearly belong to the genre of comedy.

<P>
The essay seeks to recover and legitimate a sense of bodily vitality by
contrasting the healthy attitudes of Continentals, mainly the French,
to the defensive inhibitions of the English. The bodily behavior of
the French is not idealized beyond the bounds of the comic--their energy
resembles Roland's, a type of the laughable automaton--but the playfulness
and easy communion Lewis finds between the actors here announces the
ludic, empathic character of the fun. The genteel buffoonery of these
French bodies is mellowed, moreover, through its fellowship with the
French mind, which ingratiates them to each other and to us:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[The French bourgeois] will . . . establish a playful and more
intimate relation between your respective persons--to glory in
their warmth and fitness, to slap you on the shoulders, to take your
arm in his hand. . . . This will not in the least detract from the
severe and dignified attitude of your two minds, and their sentimental
intercourses. The Frenchman regards our bodies as children, and when the
minds, like the two fathers, have become friendly, it seems natural to
him that the bodies also should become better acquainted and have their
little sport. [<I>WB,</I> 251-52]

The comic marriage of blood and brain that Lewis intimates here
is consummated in the summary praise of the French as one of "those
vivacious and thoughtful races, for whom life is <I>game</I>" (emphasis
added), and for whom

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
such a monstrous growth as this universal life of sport [the English
mind's denial of <I>corpus ludens</I> in the discipline of body-building]
. . . would be impossible and above all unnecessary. This division weakens
both life and play. But it is in our case meant as a blow at life, to
divide life's forces. Art is only worth anything when the artist is as
vulnerable in it as in his body. [<I>WB,</I> 254]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Annulling the opposition he will later drive between the laughing observer
and the laughable object, Lewis declares an essential reciprocity between
himself as author of comedy and its wild body, presumably his own--a
synergy once again empowered through the (French) sense of play. And
with the same value in mind he rewrites the typical scene of Bergsonian
comedy here, deploying the orange peel for the comic automaton to slip
on but falling together with the victim: "Often walking beside some man,
nervous and exasperated, and silently imputing to him the whole gamut of
stupidity and meanness, have you not felt that . . . should you slip by
chance on a piece of orange peel, catch at him instinctively, drag him
down with you on the ground, and roll about a bit with him, all would
be well?" (<I>WB,</I> 252) Ludicrousness, in the full sense of that
word, shapes Lewis's early understanding of comedy, and the admission
of openness and vulnerability that attend it stand in sharp contrast to
the ridicule later professed, through the persona of the Enemy, in his
brandishing of the satirist's armored hide.

The revisions Lewis performed on the stories he republished in 1927
are informed centrally and crucially by the political lesson first
adduced in "Le P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois," in 1910. Even at that
early date, this lesson provided him the vantage, as we have seen, for
significant revision of previous stories, by enabling him to read the
political character of the demagogic Franciscan back into the apparently
innocuous capers of Roland. His later adjustments essentially repeat that
procedure. He extends the recognition first limned in "Fran&ccedil;ois,"
applies it retroactively, and continues to shift the essential tenor
of comedy from the ludicrous to the ridiculous. To place his later work
on a developmental continuum with the earlier, moreover, is to subjoin
its apparent mastery to those difficult beginnings. The ambiguities
revolving around musical and vitalist empathy with the Wild Body beget
fresh complexities, but he moves these toward resolution in the harsh
solvent of the political convictions first expressed in "Fran&ccedil;ois."

<P>
Rewriting "Le P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois" as "Franciscan Adventures,"
Lewis simply takes the earlier political intuitions up a discursive
level, fixing generic tags on the populist musician, whose experience
now typifies the values of post-Revolutionary, populist,

<B></B>

"Republican France" (<I>WB,</I> 121): he is a "sickly re of early
republican romance" (<I>WB,</I> 129). The pre-"Fran&ccedil;ois" stories
must undergo more extensive revision, however, because these sustain
ambiguities about acoustic empathy that are simply intolerable now. Thus
Lewis seeks to write equivocation out of these stories, to this purpose
showing a striking singlemindedness. His target in "Les Saltimbanques"
is the players' musical complicity with their audience. These exchanges,
contested but necessary in 1909, showed Lewis conceding his own part in
the verbal and acoustic milieu; his later revision, however, takes back
that concession. Thus the musical soothing of the public beast no longer
provides the show in the retitled piece, "The Cornac and His Wife," where
the action seems to revert to the acrobatics suggested by the original
heading, "Les Saltimbanques":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Whenever one of these monsters was met with, which on an average was twice
a day, the only means of escape for the unfortunate family was to charm
it. Conduct involving that never failed to render the monster harmless
and satisfied. Then they would hurry on, until they met another. Then
they would repeat just the same thing over again, and once more hasten
away, boiling with resentment. [<I>WB,</I> 92]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This silencing of a formerly musical relationship coincides with a newly
virulent antipathy to the public, asserted by the author through his
players. The urgent need to distance themselves from the audience signals
a repressed but unforgotten connection, a linkage primarily acoustic;
it is most forcibly recalled when most strenuously repressed: "Had you
suggested to the Showman that the Public paid for an idea, <I>something
it drew out of itself,</I> that would have been a particularly repugnant
thought." (<I>WB,</I> 93; emphasis added) "Particularly repugnant" to
the Showman (the author's provisional double) in 1927 is a thought
Lewis presented with eloquence and imaginative penetration in 1909,
when he heard the rhythms and movements of the public's own inner
vitalism--something it drew out of itself--echoing back through the
sounds made by the players: a perfect paradigm of acoustic empathy. Now
infected with political meanings, this formerly musical union survives
only as an uneasy memory, a residual irritant--a sore point for the
author no less than his Showman.

<P>
Behind the circuit of acoustic connection that Lewis esteemed earlier
lay the residual pull of the harsh music of Breton speech, and so it
seems appropriate, in conclusion, to revisit that scene of primary
edification and chart the evolution of attitudes toward its appeals. In
the early account of Bretonic speech in "Les Saltimbanques" ,
Lewis's narrator echoes the bracing appreciation made in the 1908
diary fragment, repeating its conceit. This vocal music appears to be
alternately excited and imperturbable; it displays the odd but exciting
combination of spontaneous vitalism and controlled mechanism. He expands
that paradox, too, as he hears the speakers grasping vibrant life at its
most intense--that is, at its most predetermined, automatic, fatalistic:

<P>
In the 1927 revision, however, Lewis's Showman stands "before a
congregation of Hodges, who could not even express themselves in
the metropolitan tongue, but gibbered in breton, day in, day out"
(<I>WB,</I> 92).

<P>
In "Franciscan Adventures," similarly, the author revokes his
early fascination with a passion more exacting than his earlier
appreciation. Here he alters his former excitements both in letter
and spirit, casting the very terms of his first infatuation (emphasized
here)--the paradoxical but pleasing medley of vitalism and mechanism--into
labels of evident "scorn" for the Breton priest: "I examined this old
song-bird with scorn. <I>Monotonous passion,</I> stereotyped into a
<I>frenzied machine,</I> he irritated me like an aimlessly howling
wind. . . . What emotions had this <I>automaton</I> experienced before
he accepted outcast life?" (<I>WB,</I> 121; emphases added) Accordingly,
Francis acts out a clarifying parody of his own provincial speech, both
defining and mocking the halt-and-rush rhythms that, at least in the
mouths of other speakers, have held Lewis in their thrall: "He would
stop, and with an indrawn wheeze or a quick gasp, fetch it back as it was
escaping. Then he would burst out violently again into a heaving flux of
song" (<I>WB,</I> 120). This dramatic invective goes back to 1910 and the
decisive moment of "Le P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois," where Lewis first
recognized the political meanings of acoustic empathy. It is there that
the sweet severity of Bretonic speech first goes sour. In "Franciscan
Adventures" the enlivening abruptions of the Breton dialect produce a sad
caricature in Francis, who turns its angular frisson into this blithering
staccato, staggering through his own comic prosody of discontinuity:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
These sayings occurred to him quite fortuitously, and he would
quote them <I>&agrave; propos</I> of something with which they had no
connection. Instead of adroitly leading the conversation round in such
a way that the <I>bon mot</I> might be introduced, as a less sincere
or enthusiastic man would do, he boldly uttered it, taking it as a text
for a new discourse, until another one turned up to bring what was often
its most astounding career to an abrupt end. [<I>WB,</I> 282]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
From the start the harsh music of that coastal dialect provided Lewis
a type and model of vitalist laughter; its severe percussiveness was
at one with the stabbing gestures of its mirth. Thus the narrator in
"Les Saltimbanques" actually roots the patterns of local speech in the
raucous laughter of the place:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
One sees in the Breton peasant a constant tendency to sarcasm. Their
hysterical and monotonous voices are always pitched in a strain of fierce
raillery and abuse. But this does not infect their mirth. Their laughter
is forced and meant to be wounding, and with their grins and quips they
are like armed men who never meet without clashing their swords together.

In 1927, however, that savage panoply of armored mirth is stained with
a diminutive regard; its terrible beauty is changed, utterly, in the
final assessment Lewis adds to the revised version:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
You see in the peasant of Brittany and other primitive districts of
France a constant tendency to sarcasm. Their hysterical and monotonous
voices--a variety of the "celtic" screech--are always with the Bretons
pitched in a strain of fierce raillery and abuse. But this does not affect
their mirth. Their laughter is sharp and mirthless and designed usually
to wound. With their grins and quips they are like armed men who never
meet without clashing their weapons together. Were my circus-proprietor
and his kind not so tough, this continual howl or disquieting explosion
of what is scarcely mirth would shatter them. [<I>WB,</I> 101]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Removing his Showman-counterpart (his own "kind") from vital contact with
the audience, and withdrawing his earlier benediction on the "primitive
wisdom" of their vocal culture, Lewis measures the difference of his
later estrangement most dramatically in his refusal to admit that such
laughter is mirth at all.

<P>
Has a theory of humor been confused or clarified in this process of
change? Lewis mounted his challenge to the Bergsonian model of comedy
from a Gourmontian platform, but he built it on the shifting sands of
that littoral dialect. Yes, he reduced those coastal speakers to creatures
of oral (and aural) habit; these mechanisms, apparently irreversible and
insurmountable, defied the humanist hope in Bergson's vision of redemptive
laughter. Yet the residual thrall of the vocal music of Brittany led
Lewis to thrill at the very mechanical vitality he would abuse. The
political perception of 1910 at least fuses his comic philosophy to its
object of rebuke, the oral automaton, who receives no quarter now. Human
music, an instrument of empathy and the detested social collectivism,
offers the <I>far&ccedil;eur</I> a target unmisted by fancy--the Celtic
twilight of Lewis's own youthful muse. From a history as contrary as
his, however, no literary theory stands free and clear. When he sets
out the mature conception of humor in the essays collected in <I>The
Wild Body,</I> then, he retains the twists and inconsistencies of this
development and, in this way, confirms the lasting importance of its
opening moment: the abiding role of the vocal culture of Brittany and his
obsessive engagement with--and against--the empathic response it prompts.

E. g., "The comic is that side of a person which reveals his
likeness to a thing, that aspect of human events which, through its
peculiar inelasticity, conveys the impression of pure mechanism, of
automatism, of movement without life. Consequently it calls for immediate
corrective. This corrective is laughter, a social gesture that singles out
and represses a special kind of absent-mindedness in men and in events"

The exchange between Murray and Lafourcade on the relevance of Bergson
is typical insofar as it sidetracks into subtle but largely irrelevant
distinctions on the idea of the "absurd"; see Robert Murray, "'Our Wild
Body': Lewis's Forgotten Essay," <I>Enemy News</I> 14 (summer 1981):
15-17, and Bernard Lafourcade, "The Wild Body, Bergson, and the
Absurd," <I>Enemy News</I> 15 (winter 1982): 23-25. The critical
literature on modernist comedy is far from extensive. A fairly standard
assumption is that modernism and comedy, at least in the traditional
sense, are antithetical. This view is put forward by Laura Mooneyham,
"Comedy Among the Modernists: P. G. Wodehouse and the Anachronism of Comic
Form," <I>Twentieth Century Literature</I> 40 (spring 1994): 114-38,
where the conventional comic rhythm of problem and reprieve is seen
to belong to a vision of life no longer tenable. The main problem with
this view is of course the undeclared assumption that there is a single
sensibility in modernism; it seems more helpful to think of individual
variations of certain basic premises about comedy.

Lewis discusses this work in 1935 in "Beginnings" (<I>WB,</I>

it was left unpublished in 1909, possibly because it had not reached
completion, and it appeared only in 1927. I believe the story to have
been unrevisable at that later date. It had to appear as initially
conceived, in line with the intensities and enthusiasms of that early
moment: the absolute centrality not only of the death fetish but of the
acoustic sublime in that re made this piece unamenable to the sort
of revision Lewis carried out on other early stories.

Mr. Bell assures us that Mr. Wyndham Lewis's art is practically
independent of "association or suggestion." Obviously if this means
anything it is that this gifted painter's art means nothing. Humanly

with nothing, suggested by nothing, and which suggest nothing.

<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Wyndham Lewis is nevertheless not a painter we associate with the music
 hall (like Walter Sickert or Spencer Gore). If an affection for certain
 kinds of popular culture (cabaret, revue, boxing, early Chaplin films)
 parallels the interests of cubists and Futurists and sits well with the
 polemics of <I>Blast,</I> it seems to have little to do with the art:
 with <I>Kermesse,</I> for instance, considered one of the first cubist
 paintings in England and "a landmark in the development of modernist
 painting in Britain."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 I want to argue on the contrary that <I>Kermesse</I> and its studies
 were richly suggestive and their associations locatable, and that the
 artist of the modern movement--though he might

<B></B>

see himself as a primitive mercenary in the iron jungle of the modern
city--was also an armchair fl&acirc;neur at the Alhambra who riffled
through the <I>Tatler</I> at the breakfast table. This "enormous,
jangling, journalistic, fairy desert of modern life" was the social and
discursive space of popular entertainment--"of music halls and motor-buses
and women's legs in tights and newspapers and electric sky-signs spelling
out words letter by letter"--rather than the direct expression of the
industrialized modernity that underpinned it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
Lewis dated his maturity as a painter to 1912, to the year of
<I>Kermesse</I> and its studies, the <I>Timon</I> series, and paintings
exhibited at the second Post-Impressionist exhibition, including
<I>Creation</I> and <I>Mother and Child.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 "Kermesse" is the term for a peasant fair or carnival in the Low
 Countries, one characterized by boisterous merry-making.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 <I>Kermesse</I> was important to him: it was very large (nearly nine
 foot square), it was several times repainted and exhibited to some
 r&eacute;clame, and Lewis himself at a moment of sober stocktaking
 considered it the touchstone of his prewar achievement.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 It is probably the major loss among his early paintings and Lewis
 would not have balked at its landmark status. But it was more than
 a staging-post en route to abstraction. It was also "of" something,
 something that resides not in "what it depicts or resembles" but in
 what it is "causally related to or determined by"; its imagery and
 modernist handling served Lewis's private purposes as well as his
 professional ambitions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 More generally, the case of Lewis invites us to reconsider the tangled
 relations between popular culture and the prewar avant-gardes. These
 relations are usually conceived in one-way terms as a popular response
 to the avant-garde (where outrage or satire is the sine qua non
 of radical status), or an avant-garde address to the popular (where
 strategic raids on mass culture secure the vigor and modernity of a new
 cultural elite). But something more complicated seems to have gone on,
 something that partially undermined the high/low divide and involved
 the new fashionability both of popular forms like music-hall revue and
 of marginal forms like avant-garde art. Ragtime, Post-Impressionism,
 Futurism, and the tango craze excited a broad slice of the social
 spectrum, jostled for space in the newspapers with suffragette militancy
 and industrial unrest, and were often discussed in reciprocal terms
 ("Futurist politics," "ragtime painting," "anarchy in high art"). Social
 spaces (the salon, the gallery, the music hall, the studio, the bar),
 agents and networks of relations (between colleagues, rivals, patrons,
 critics, curators, dealers), formal and informal institutions and events
 (the Slade, the Caf&eacute; Royal, the Cabaret Theatre Club, the Omega
 Workshops, the Rebel Art Centre, the Post-Impressionist exhibitions,
 Ethel Levey in <I>Hullo Ragtime!,</I> Sergey Diaghilev at Covent Garden,
 F. T. Marinetti at the Coliseum): all these produced a world in which
 subjectivities, social relations, works of art, and aesthetic programs
 were being constantly and reciprocally retuned.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Perhaps this happens anyway, under modern conditions, but the process
 is at this moment newly self-conscious and peculiarly vivid. We can
 neither dissolve the art object back into the full complexity of its
 social context, hoping to rediscover it in its full historicity--context,
 like semiosis, is a story without end--nor offer an exhaustive account
 of its causes inferred from a reading of the object as "effect." In
 the case of Lewis, however,

<B></B>

we can at least track some of the traffic between painting and
performance, between the studio and the outside world (including the
avant-garde as a phenomenon <I>in</I> the public world of newspapers,
cabaret, decor, and fancy dress), between high culture and popular
entertainment, between modernism and masculinity.

<P>
Many of Lewis's prewar works take dance as an explicit theme or a covert
resource, a fact that should be taken a great deal more seriously than it
is. The variety and significance of Edwardian dance forms, however, has
been wildly underrated. The impact of Diaghilev and the Russian Ballet
has been allowed to eclipse the reputations of their contemporaries (many
of them women) and the influence of eurhythmics, popular and vernacular
dance forms, and dance in music-hall revue. Edward Marsh, an early patron
of Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, and Duncan Grant, certainly went to
see Vaslav Nijinsky, but he also went ten times to <I>Hullo Ragtime!</I>
at the Alhambra, often in the company of Rupert Brooke.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 They would have heard Ethel Levey's rendition of <I>Waiting for the
 Robert E. Lee,</I> presumably the inspiration for the painting by
 Christopher Nevinson, reproduced upside down in the <I>Daily Sketch</I>
 in October 1913 ("to show that it doesn't matter"), and described as
 "certainly ragtime art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Marsh was one of those dragooned by Lady Muriel Paget into wearing the
 costumes she had commissioned from Nevinson and Lewis for the Futurism
 tableaux at the Albert Hall Picture Ball in December 1913. That he wore
 such a costume (and what D. H. Lawrence thought about it) we know from
 his biography, but the little we know of its appearance derives from
 photographs published in the <I>Sketch.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P>
It is now a commonplace that the early years of the twentieth century
were marked by accelerating modernization in all the technological and
social meanings of the term and that a single generation encountered the
internal combustion engine, the radio, the telephone, the gramophone,
aeroplanes, and the cinema. One of the less remarked but more influential
developments was the introduction of photography into the mass-circulation
dailies and weeklies of the period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 These had always been illustrated, if at all, with engravings. The
 half-tone reproduction process brought not just a change of technique
 but a change in content and impact. The photograph had a different
 kind of detail and immediacy, and lent itself to that promiscuous
 collage of items that makes up the substance of magazines like the
 <I>Tatler,</I> the <I>Bystander,</I> or the <I>Sketch.</I> This
 immediacy was enhanced in contemporary advertising and in the cinema
 <I>actualit&eacute;s</I> that formed a popular part of the music-hall
 program, and it was exploited both by the "invented traditions" of
 the establishment and the political tactics of contemporary pressure
 groups. This new photographic hegemony, if we can call it that, marks
 a key moment in the consolidation of a spectacular society: not just a
 society saturated with images, or with spectacles of different kinds--the
 audience for which was massively extended by photographic reproduction,
 mass literacy, and the huge circulations of the halfpenny papers--but a
 "society of the spectacle" in Guy Debord's sense, a society in which
 social relations are mediated through spectacle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P>
Art--although in many debates a term that acted as a repository for
everything immutable and transcendent, the principal signifier of what
could <I>not</I> be brought down to the terms of technological progress
or the vested interests of politics or the

<B></B>

marketplace--was itself caught up in the processes of modernization (and
modern reproduction). Avant-garde artists particularly, shorn of the
forms of patronage that kept society portraitists, the genre painters,
academicians--or for that matter the New English Art Club--afloat,
nevertheless had to make their reputations and their livings. They were
notorious in a new way, partly by accident and partly by design, partly
because their works confounded established criteria of competence and
partly because they were (prepared to be) fodder for a voracious press
that could now print photographs of their paintings, sometimes sideways
or upside down. "Modern art" became a subcategory of the editor's
repertoire of humorous, topical, or scandalous images, and labels like
"Post-Impressionist," "cubist," or "Futurist" caused "copy to foam up
under the pen like paper in a conjurer's hat to overflowing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P>
At the same time as artists like Lewis reacted to what they perceived
as the "feminization" and "bourgeoisification" of art--and perhaps for
this reason--they were seeking a living from wealthy, aristocratic,
female patrons, some of them not averse to a certain butch allure, who
wanted dining rooms, fancy dresses, and party favors in avant-garde
styles. Contrary to the popular trope of the embattled avant-garde, the
avant-garde was briefly and--on certain terms, it is true--fashionable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Nevinson refers to lectures and soir&eacute;es attended by prewar
 Society and "one hundred and one Guardees and Guinnesses";
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 and Lewis to the years when "Coronetted envelopes showered into my
 letter-box."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 In the <I>Tatler</I> the avant-garde rubs shoulders with the aristocracy,
 with sportsmen and adventurers, popular entertainers, dancers, and
 music-hall artists. Futurism, in effect, offered to broker relations
 between them. It produced a frenzied, self-consciously modern imagery
 of railway stations and states of mind, of <I>Waiting for the Robert
 E. Lee</I> or <I>The Pan-Pan Dance at the Monico.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 It transformed the avant-garde artist into a sportsman-adventurer in
 the grip of technophiliac lust--a new prototype of masculinity roaring
 away from the fin de si&egrave;cle in a gobble and whirr of pistons
 and propellers--and simultaneously into

<B></B>

a performer (even a music-hall performer) in an ambiguous embrace of
the demotic. Futurism offered newspaper readers a new entertainment,
entertainers a topic for popular satire, the avant-garde a newly bombastic
self-image, and a few aristocratic patrons a celebrity based not on birth,
wealth, or attainment but on consumption and taste: an identity, indeed,
derived from association with the avant-garde and from <I>being seen</I>
as a consumer of outr&eacute; commodities in the popular press. For
those who chose to respond to it, from principle or expediency, this
was a new, if compromised, space in which to operate.

We can bring these relations into sharper focus by looking at the studies
associated with <I>Kermesse</I>--the painting itself was sold at auction
in 1927 and disappeared after 1930--and at the kinds of performance in
which they were implicated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Take, first, Lewis's <I>Lovers</I> (<A
 HREF="4.2tickner_1.html"> 1</A>), a work on paper of 1912,
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 and its remarkable similarity to a photograph published in
 J. E. Crawford Flitch's <I>Modern Dancing and Dancers</I> (<A
 HREF="4.2tickner_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Lewis's image may have been based on the photographs in Flitch,
 and certainly they reference the same event and the same way of
 choreographing relations between couples who in Lewis's title are
 specifically "Lovers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 But in what sense are studies like <I>Lovers</I>--including the Yale
 <I>Kermesse</I> (M72), <I>Design for a Programme Cover--Kermesse</I>
 (M52), and <I>The Dancers </I>(Study for <I>Kermesse?</I>)--"of" the
 dance? And of which dance? And what was the referent and work of "the
 dance" in Lewis's pictorial strategies?

<P>
The Flitch illustration is a photograph of Fred Farren and Beatrice
Collier performing the "Danse des Apaches" from <I>A Day in Paris,</I>
a ballet that opened at the Empire music hall in London on 19 October
1908 and continued well into 1909.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Paris was easily accessible yet peculiarly exotic: a place where tourism
 was not just a

<B></B>

matter of viewing the principal monuments, collections, and promenades,
but of experiencing a social and sexual geography of brasseries,
caf&eacute;s, markets, studios, dance halls, music halls and cabarets,
all of them linked to an ethnography of writers, painters, students,
dancers, clowns, prostitutes, gangsters, and grisettes. <I>A Day in
Paris</I> revelled in the tourist's city. Its scenes were set in the Place
de l'Op&eacute;ra, on the quais, in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, outside
the Moulin Rouge, and inside the Artists' Ball. Its cast of characters
included a panoply of Parisian types and the Bullivant Smiths, tourists
from Brixton, whose visit provided the narrative conceit. The audience
could revel in the myth of "Gay Paree"--the Paris of <I>Trilby,</I> the
Moulin Rouge, and <I>La Vie de Boh&egrave;me</I>--or affect a knowing
distance from it by finding the tourists amusing. As Max Beerbohm
observed in his column in the <I>Saturday Review,</I> Paris was now a
pasteboard parody of its former glories: "All reality seems to have gone
out of it, leaving only a hard artificial glare for the bedazzlement of
tourists." It was "less like a city than a stage set": bohemia was dead.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P>
The sensation of the evening was the "Danse des Apaches." The <I>Times</I>
suggested that "for this alone <I>A Day in Paris</I> is well worth
seeing"; it was rapidly written up, photographed, and caricatured in
the press, in addition to being widely imitated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 (By February 1909, the <I>Tatler</I> observed that "at the present
 time--such is the penalty of success--the apache dance finds a place
 on nearly every music-hall programme throughout the country.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 More securely to the point, perhaps, than the comparison of
 <I>Lovers</I> with the photograph in Flitch, is the parallel between
 Lewis's characteristic aura of erotic menace and this account of the
 dance's emotional temperature:

The cold, compelling cruelty of everything he did, the calculated
brutality to the girl who adored him for it, was a thing of great
artistry, because the passion of the man for the girl he half strangled
and threw about, was allowed to throb through in the most subtle and
amazing way. Every movement, every poise, every piece of seeming brutality
registered and was from the miming and dancing point of view, a work of
art . . . such things come but once in a lifetime and the Apache Dance

"Apaches" was a term coined in 1902 by the journalist Authur Dupin for
the "savages" of the Parisian underclass: tribes of unemployed, violent,
criminal hooligans with "the manners of the apaches, of the Far-West,
the native scum of our civilisation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 In the early months of 1902 the headlines were filled with the vendetta
 between Manda and Leca, the leaders of rival apache bands, and in
 particular with accounts of an affray in broad daylight on 5 January,
 which left the rue Planchat splattered with blood and strewn with
 knives, axes, and revolvers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Lewis himself lived for several years in the vicinity of the Montparnasse
 territory fought over by the gangs of <I>"la Mouffe" </I>and <I>"la
 Maube." </I>Like Augustus John and Christopher Nevinson (known in
 Montmartre as <I>"l'apache qui rit"</I> [<I>PP,</I> 65]), he had
 first-hand knowledge of the Paris apaches.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 In <I>Blast</I> Lewis blessed Paris specifically for the "BALLADS of
 its PREHISTORIC APACHE Superb hardness and hardiesse of its Voyou type,
 rebellious adolescent" (an implicit riposte to the "BRITANNIC AESTHETE
 . . .

<B></B>

SNEAK AND SWOT OF THE SCHOOL-ROOM").
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 But the image of <I>Lovers</I> comes via the stage, not direct from
 the street.

<P>
From 1902 to 1914 the Parisian papers were constantly exercised by the
problem of apaches. A major campaign in <I>Le Matin</I> (probably intended
to counter liberal moves to abolish the guillotine) peaked in 1907.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 In 1907 and 1908 Lewis was living in Paris while Max Dearly was
 choreographing his new <I>Revue de la femme.</I> The apaches in a
 sense were already "spectacular": each band distinguished itself in a
 particular way, though sharing a propensity for peaked caps or melon
 hats, pomaded hair and kiss-curls, collarless shirts with vivid silk
 neckerchiefs, and elaborate footwear (<I>CO,</I> 40). The violent,
 amoral, and flamboyant re of the apache condensed a range of
 social anxieties while offering what the image of the gangster has
 always offered: a seductive, unfettered masculinity, the revenge of
 the outcast on bourgeois propriety. Manda, Leca, and Am&eacute;lie
 H&eacute;lie ("Casque d'Or"), the object of their affections, became
 household names and even folk-heroes. The <I>beau monde</I> flocked to
 see Leca and his apaches arrive at the cabaret of Le Bruyant Alexandre
 where Casque d'Or had been booked as a chanteuse. The Bouffes-du-Nord
 offered her a contract to star in a production of <I>Casque d'Or et les
 Apaches.</I> She was painted by Albert Dupr&eacute; for the Salon and
 photographed by the Pirou studios for portrait <I>cartes de visite</I>
 wearing a pearl-grey costume and ostrich-feather hat. Her memoirs were
 published in serial form in the fortnightly <I>Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle.</I>
 She had a starring role at the trial of Manda and his associates in
 May 1902, when the elegance of the public galleries rivalled that of
 a theatrical first night.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<P>
The apaches shared with even impoverished working-class Parisians a
passion for dancing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 The <I>bals</I> of Montmartre and Montparnasse were legendary. What
 became known as the <I>danse des apaches</I> was not, however,
 the vernacular expression of a Parisian subculture, despite being
 occasionally taken as such. In fact it was wholly the invention of Max
 Dearly for a revue at the Moulin Rouge.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 He danced it with Mistinguett, the stage name for Jean Bourgeois, as part
 of a show called <I>La Revue de la femme,</I> starting a vogue that first
 reached London in Fred Farren's choreography for <I>A Day in Paris</I>
 in 1908, in a scene set in the Moulin Rouge, and lasted into the 1950s.

<P>
Dearly's choreography, and its English and American adaptations, focused
new anxieties concerning the numbers, effects, and supposed tribal
organization of the Parisian underclass through the Manda-Leca-Casque
d'Or geometry of the sexual triangle. The notoriety of the apaches
and the public clamor surrounding them was condensed into a drama of
Montagues and Capulets in modern dress, a self-conscious update of <I>La
Vie de Boh&egrave;me.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The <I>Tatler</I> described the apache dance as the dance of the
 Parisian hooligan, "the degenerate, half-mad creature which seems to
 be a product of the twentieth-century civilisation"; and Flitch, who
 considered Farren's adaptation of it his finest achievement, praised
 Mistinguett as "a dancer who has brought into the dance all the nervous
 excitement of modernity" (<I>MD,</I> 183).
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

The crimes of passion enacted in the apache dance were "savage" insofar
as they represented the antithesis of bourgeois concepts of love and
sexuality--illicit, sadistic, explicit, vengeful, and wildly disruptive
(<A HREF="4.2tickner_3.html"> 3</A>). The choreography represented

<B></B>

the antithesis of the Romantic ballet tradition and of "classical" dancing
on the London stage. It is not necessary to rely on photographs for a
sense of it, since several fragments of film survive. A brief extract
from Path&eacute;'s <I>L'Empreinte, ou, la Main Rouge</I>  clearly
shows Dearly and Mistinguett, dancing in a wine cellar to an accordianist
before an impromptu audience of local Parisians joined, significantly,
by two slumming, top-hatted, fur-collared bourgeois and a fashionably
dressed woman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The movements are violently acrobatic and erotic, miming extremes of
 attraction and repulsion: the woman is literally

<B></B>

thrown around by the man, threatened by him (at one moment he simulates
garrotting, with his forearm across her throat), and, in a defining
gesture, pulled down backwards by her hair. Casque d'Or, in her memoirs,
dismisses pallid, milk-sop notions of bourgeois romance and explicitly
celebrates the exaction of a blood tribute from her admirers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 But the dance is usually a pas de deux, in which the jealous rival is
 presumed to be offstage. It ends violently, often with the murder of the
 girl, but in any case with the reassertion of masculine power over her
 fickle and disruptive sexuality. In illustrations the male is always
 dark and unshaven, with a cap, muffler, and sometimes a dagger, while
 the woman has a flared, ankle-length skirt, and a necktie by which she
 is whirled around. These movements and accessories were the defining
 elements of the apache image, not as it existed in its local variety, but
 as it was reduced and condensed for the cinema, the stage, contemporary
 photographs and caricatures, and as a popular form of fancy dress.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

If we miss that cap and muffler and the contemporary resonance of
those sequential poses--the complex of allusions to the social reality,
mythology, and popular choreography of the apaches--we miss the narratives
of violence and sexual jealousy that fuel an image like <I>Lovers,</I>
an image nevertheless frozen and <I>staged</I> in its geometries. In the
end this image is not located on the street but at the Moulin Rouge,
the Empire, the Alhambra, the Coliseum, or the Palace, and identities
that were already to a high degree performative have been tamed and
transformed into a commodified spectacle for the music-hall stage. The
shift from the whirling forms of popular caricature, as in the work of
H. M. Bateman (<A HREF="4.2tickner_4.html"> 4</A>), into the
angular vocabulary of cubo-futurism, is also expressive. The jagged
shapes of <I>Lovers </I>have work to do, sliding

<B></B>

ambiguously between reference and abstraction. The splintered facets on
the left, for instance, framing the corners at top and bottom, evoke,
subliminally, the top-hatted head and shoulder of a looming spectator;
alternatively, the torpedo-shape in the bottom left corner seems to
contain a viewer seen from above, and a tautly elliptical phallus
thrusting vigorously into the back of the woman on the left presses
her into the rough embrace of her partner, underwriting the sexual
tensions in more rative elements of the drawing. The work is partly
<I>about</I> this self-conscious restaging of modern sexualities, in
which the apache stands as a local and contemporary manifestation of an
atavistic masculinity, and as the screen for projective identifications
on the part of a (very bourgeois and masculine) avant-garde subjectivity,
one in flight from nineteenth-century bourgeois proprieties and in pursuit
of an emancipated, twentieth-century sexual identity and experience.

<P>
The ambience of the music hall features here too, as a particular kind
of social space and a particular kind of pictorial subject. R. Belfort,
describing the Empire in 1902, observed that "aristocrats, artists,
bourgeois, students, provincials, foreigners and 'the man in the street'
form component parts of the Empire public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Many were connoisseurs of variety turns and, especially, ballet but
 at least some derived part of their pleasure from the social mix and
 the sexual attractions of stage and promenade. What distinguished the
 music hall from the legitimate theater was the nature of the acts, the
 availability of drink, and the opportunity of circulating during the
 performance. This encouraged a volatile, well-oiled, participatory
 audience, and a link to prostitution. Halls like the Empire and the
 Alhambra (both in Leicester Square) were located in areas well known
 for soliciting. The Empire "Promenade," in particular, was notorious as
 the haunt of prostitutes and an informal club for "colonial officials,
 soldiers, civil servants, 'advanced' clergymen . . . the aristocracy,
 young bloods, Bohemians, and ordinary music-hall goers"--all attracted by
 what Compton Mackenzie nostalgically recalled as "peripatetic harlotry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P>
The taint, or promise, of sexuality caused an outcry when Walter Sickert
exhibited <I>Gatti's Hungerford Palace of Varieties: Second Turn of Miss
Katie Lawrence</I> in 1888.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Sickert was no doubt stimulated by contact with Edgar Degas and scenes
 of urban entertainment in France. Until then, as Anna Robins points
 out, the halls were celebrated in literary circles but not depicted by
 the Victorian painters of modern life. Sickert in turn inspired Spencer
 Gore, who began a series of studies of music-hall and ballet subjects
 at the Old Bedford and the Alhambra in 1906.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Both artists depict the audience against a brightly lit stage or up in
 the gallery. Sickert offers a <I>com&eacute;die humaine</I> and Gore a
 rendering of the artificial brilliance of performance itself; they seem
 a world away from Lewis and <I>Lovers</I> (although Lewis was friendly
 with Gore and wrote his obituary in <I>Blast,</I> praising him over
 Degas for his "scenes from the London music-halls [which] brought to
 light a new world of witty illusion").
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The influence of cubism and Futurism lies between them but also something
 more: Lewis's detachment and antihumanism: the artist cannot be "of" the
 scene or even portray it with human warmth. But <I>Lovers</I> belongs
 to the tradition of Degas, Sickert, and Gore, albeit tangentially. Lewis
 made the connection himself.

<B></B>

The transformation of the tradition was not a matter of the flight to
abstraction--"the particular transcripts you make will respond to some
personal and logical vision, or the abstract arrangements will have
their direct parallel in Nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 It was a matter of short-circuiting the connection between inner vision
 and outer motif. "D&eacute;gas would be getting in the Poulailler [the
 gallery] and gaze down on actors' heads, or get next the orchestra
 and stare up at them, to induce Nature to supply a simulance of his
 vision. We to-day dispense more or less with these acrobatics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Lewis had seen his dancers but had not directly transcribed them, or
 that was the claim: they were inside his head.

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Four years separate <I>Lovers</I> from <I>A Day in Paris.</I> The strong
but speculative argument is that Flitch's 1912 reproduction of Farren
and Collier's 1908 performance is the link that brings them together. The
weaker but less contentious claim is that there was a rich vein of apache
references in popular culture before and after 1912--apache dancers,
apache balls, apache films, apache costumes in the fancy-dress craze--on
which <I>Lovers</I> draws, but with an affect peculiar to Lewis's private
concerns. The immediate impetus for <I>Lovers,</I> as for <I>Kermesse,</I>
lies in the coincidence of two events in the spring of 1912: the first
London exhibition of Futurist paintings at the Sackville Gallery in
March, and Madame Frida Uhl Strindberg's plans for a cabaret called the
Cave of the Golden Calf or Cabaret Theatre Club, published in April.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

<P>
The "Preliminary Prospectus" of the Cave promised an interior "entirely
and exclusively decorated" by "leading young British artists." The
cabaret would embrace "On one hand such art as we owe to the genius of
the people, the dance, folk lore--on the other offering free development
to the youngest and best of our contemporaries and--'Futurists'"
(<I>ABG,</I> 63).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Gore was put in charge of decorations, and Lewis was a leading
 contributor. Through them the cabaret drew into its more exclusive and
 self-conscious ambience a tradition of painterly engagement with music
 hall and revue, a tradition now redefined as Futurist for reasons of
 modernist credibility. Dance was a common emblem of emancipation and
 even, in its contentious new forms, of sexual licence. It made a suitable
 theme for a venue taking its title from the Biblical narrative of Moses
 and the Golden Calf, hinting none too subtly at pagan orgies and drunken
 revelry. The Cave staged everything from flamenco and tarantella to
 "classical," "nautch," "veil," and "coster" dances. It offered tango
 teas and champagne suppers; in the small hours it was, according to
 Osbert Sitwell, "a super-heated Vorticist garden of gesticulating
 res, dancing and talking while the rhythm of the primitive forms
 of ragtime throbbed through the wide room."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Dance was also prominent at the Sackville Gallery, where the most popular
 works were the Futurist Gino Severini's <I>Blue Dancer</I> and <I>The
 Pan-Pan Dance at the Monico.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 The impact of Futurism was critical for Lewis, if often denied. It
 can be traced obliquely, in the impress of comparable handling or
 themes, and even in the force of denial itself. The use of blue in
 the <I>Kermesse</I> studies might alert us to it (as a nod to <I>Blue
 Dancer</I> or,

<B></B>

somewhat sarcastically, in the direction of precubist Picasso); or what
is perhaps a reworking of Severini's <I>Pan-Pan Dance</I>--a cheerful,
urbane, kaleidoscopic, picture-puzzle--into something whirling, darker,
fractured, and menacing like the Yale <I>Kermesse.</I> The precise
dates within 1912 are not secure, so nothing is sure, but I am arguing
that a confluence of rivalry and patronage provoked <I>Kermesse</I> and
its associated studies, a rivalry sparked by the challenge of Futurism,
even <I>Blue Dancer,</I> and patronage secured with the commission for
the Cave.

<P>
Cabaret developed in France, out of the caf&eacute; concert.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Originally rooted in the more or less private and spontaneous exchanges
 of writers and poets, during the 1880s and 1890s cabaret was transformed
 through the efforts of entrepreneurs and performers like Rodolph Salis
 (at the Chat Noir) and Aristide Bruant (at Le Mirliton) into an intimate
 but public entertainment, by turns literary, dramatic, satirical,
 scabrous, sentimental, and demotic. Half a dozen cabarets are listed in
 the 1907 Paris Baedeker, including the <I>"cabarets illusionnistes"</I>
 on the Boulevard Clichy: the Cabaret de l'Enfer, the Cabaret du Ciel,
 and the Cabaret du N&eacute;ant, but tourists are warned that their
 songs, mystic illusions, and shadow-plays "presuppose a considerable
 knowledge of colloquial French" and "are scarcely suitable for ladies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Already in 1905, one commentator had observed that the local cabarets
 have "long since ceased to attract the Montmartrois, and are kept up
 as mere show places for provincial and foreign tourists" (like the
 Bullevant Smiths in <I>A Day in Paris</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 After 1900, however, cabaret was increasingly taken up by the avant-garde
 and diffused across Europe. While its passing or dilution was mourned
 in Paris, new cabarets were opened in Berlin, Barcelona, Munich, Cracow,
 Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Zurich. Italy and England are absent from the
 list because in Italy the place of cabaret was to some extent taken by
 Futurism, while in England cabaret was "alien from its very inception."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 This was the view early in 1912 of Francis Toye in the <I>Bystander:</I>
 satire was the lifeblood of cabaret and satire (and shameless
 chansonniers) were precluded by English good taste. Cabaret would
 never transplant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 But only two months later he offered a warm if cautious reception to
 the Cave of the Golden Calf, and the <I>Times</I> concluded that the
 cabaret habit was finally taking root in London.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

<P>
Mme. Strindberg embraced avant-garde art and artists with unfeigned
enthusiasm, but undoubtedly her "futurist" d&eacute;cor was good for
publicity and publicity was good--in fact was a precondition--for
the avant-garde. It was a two-way street. Cabaret interiors, informal
and eclectic, had signalled their bohemianism with artists' posters,
paintings, and signboards, ever since Salis and Bruant had shown work
by Th&eacute;ophile Steinlen, Jules Cheret, and Toulouse-Lautrec. The
actual Golden Calf in the Cave, Eric Gill's household pet and tutelary
presence, was prered in Steinlen's signboard for the Chat Noir,
in the stained-glass window of the Golden Calf that Salis commissioned
for the club's new premises in 1885, and by the huge golden pig in the
Cabaret du Ciel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 The promise of an artistic ambience was part of the cabaret's
 attraction for its social mix: "artists, writers, poets, East-end Jews,
 men-about-town, dancers, <I>cocottes</I> and all the rest of them," as
 Nevinson described the customers at the Crab Tree Club (<I>PP,</I> 62).
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Mme. Strindberg's promotional literature linked the

<B></B>

cabaret and the music hall to the Futurists as sources of inspiration;
she praised variety as "the natural form of art" or "at least a perennial
expression of artistic temperament" and promised that her new cabaret
would encourage "art in this spontaneous and flexible form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 For their part artists could earn some money (a pressing need),
 socialize, manifesto-ize, and inhale what we have come to call the
 oxygen of publicity. (Lewis confessed that although the Cabaret was
 "the cause of so many ridiculous vexations to me. . . . it serves to
 fill up the necessary gaps financially" [<I>L,</I> 46]).
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>

<P>
Lewis's contribution to the Cave was extensive. An unsigned note in
the Cornell archives from Mme. Strindberg offers him payment for two
paintings, a pair of screens, and the arrangement and decoration of
the walls.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 In a later memoir he refers to "the somewhat abstract hieroglyphics I
 had painted round the walls, [which] with the impassioned orchestra
 . . . must have provided a kick or two for the young man about town
 of the moment," adding that it was his first job: "I did not receive
 a great deal for my night-club murals (actually &#163;60). I was quite
 unknown, however, and would have done them for nothing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 He also painted the drop-curtain (still wet on the opening night),
 designed posters, menus, envelopes, and various pieces of printed
 ephemera, and contributed a "Painter-Poet's Night" of <I>ombres
 chinoises</I> ("chinese shadows," or shadow plays) in 1913.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Most importantly, he also contributed <I>Kermesse,</I> which hung on
 the stairs like a preface to the revelry below.

<P>
The only remaining record of this nine-foot painting is a drypoint
by Horace Brodzky, about the size of a postcard, called <I>Viewing
Kermesse,</I> from an exhibition in New York in 1917.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 At an earlier exhibition (the Allied Artists' Association in 1912),
 Roger Fry had praised it as the only work to survive the ordeal of
 being hung in the ample surroundings of the Albert Hall, and both Fry
 and Clive Bell, in contemporary reviews, had advised the viewer to take
 the lift to the gallery, from which vantage "He will be able to judge
 [it] as he would judge music--that is to say as pure formal composition"
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 and "abstract harmony."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Brodzky's viewer looks at an easel painting that he is encouraged to
 read formally, framed by the gallery context and by a critical discourse
 adapting Walter Pater's dictum that "all art aspires to the condition
 of music" to modernist ends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 This was not, however, the painting's original form or context at the
 Cabaret Theatre Club. Brodzky's viewer did not see the <I>same</I>
 painting that Lewis had painted in 1912, not only because Lewis had
 changed it, but because the cabaret itself produced a different kind of
 audience. This audience was socially mixed; self-consciously bohemian;
 seated at tables or milling around; out to enjoy itself talking,
 flirting, eating, drinking, smoking, and dancing; engaged with the
 spectacle on stage and off; it occupied to the full the senses of
 its <I>social</I> body, with art as backdrop--the very antithesis
 of the gallery's contemplative, even critical, "eye." Augustus John,
 Lewis's erstwhile mentor, wrote that he was "greatly impressed by your
 picture. . . . In spite of the perplexing and unaccustomed elements of
 the design I recognize the energy and grandeur of the conception and
 am positively moved by it as to the beating of drums and blowing of
 horns and thumping of feet."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Sickert, who was sceptical of Lewis's more abstract work, suggested
 that for a real sense of his talent "one should see the decoration he
 has done for a night club called

<B></B>

the Cabaret. For a club where you go to dance the tango or to have other
amusement, this is just the right form of decoration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>

<P>
Reviewing his work in a letter to Ezra Pound in 1916, Lewis remarked
that <I>Kermesse</I> (in its "primitive state") had been "praised by
Roger Fry in 'the Nation,' [and then] John wrote 'thanking me' for it
etc. But even for a wall painting it is too uncouth and its unfinished
state would not recommend it to the very discriminating, <I>with which
ideal audience we must always suppose we are dealing.</I>" (<I>L,</I>
79, emphasis Lewis's). Collectively, the Cave's customers might not
have been Lewis's ideal audience, and the discriminating among them less
distracted in a gallery. But renting <I>Kermesse</I> to Mme. Strindberg
(who retained an option to purchase as part of the contract) kept Lewis in
the company of artists such as Jacob Epstein, Harold Gilman, Eric Gill,
and Gore, not to mention patrons like Ford Madox Ford and Osbert Sitwell
(later owner of <I>Lovers</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 It kept Lewis, "futurism," and the cabaret itself in the public eye;
 it framed <I>Kermesse</I> in particular ways, not necessarily to its
 disadvantage, as part of the new traffic between the avant-garde,
 performers, and entrepreneurs; and it displayed the work to a mixed
 clientele of artists, writers, actors, bohemians, aristocrats, and the
 Brigade of Guards.

<P>
Something of the flavor of the club and a sense of its checkered fortunes
can be gained (with caution) from its lightly fictionalized appearances
in three contemporary novels: Charles Marriott's <I>Subsoil</I> ,
where it res as the Rocking Horse Club; Gilbert Cannan's <I>Mendel</I>
, where it is called the Merlin's Cave; and Ford Madox Ford's
<I>The Marsden Case</I> (set in 1914 but published in 1923), where it
appears as the Night Club.

<P>
In <I>Subsoil</I> the Rocking Horse is "a Bohemian club, in the style of
Montmartre. . . . furnished as a caf&eacute; restaurant, and freakishly
decorated."
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
 It has been started with wealthy patronage as a rallying place for "the
 younger and more experimental painters and writers of London" (<I>S,</I>
 9). But Marriott's hero, Hugh Sutherland, one of its decorators and a
 founding member, is already suspicious of its success with the newspapers
 and distrustful of those who insist "on the possibility of Bohemia in
 evening-dress" (<I>S,</I> 10). Publicity was a contested value. The
 Cabaret Theatre Club vaunted its uniquely congenial surroundings for
 artists and art lovers, citing "an eminent art critic" who had praised
 its interior as the "most notable attempt in England to apply the new
 artistic gospel to permanent mural decoration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Within the novel, however, Sutherland feels that the club has been
 betrayed into the hands of traders and philistines. His acquaintance,
 Valentine Saffery, observes that they "regard us as truffle-hogs, nosing
 out the refinements of pleasure they haven't the wit to discover for
 themselves" (<I>S,</I> 16). Sutherland himself, having designed a panel
 for the club, regrets the company it keeps:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[It] represented a procession of dancing-girls, of a type suggested to him
by some Cretan rines in the British Museum, with hour-glass waists,
exaggerated hips, and breasts enormously enlarged and amalgamated by
upward pressure. While painting it, he had been inspired by the idea of
the factitious and meretricious as right for the atmosphere of the place,
as well as by the way the queerly distorted res lent themselves to
the suggestion

<B></B>

 of rhythmical movement. Now he realised how a purely artistic intention
 could be misinterpreted . . . [by] the dirty innuendo of the Philistine,
 sniffing corruption. [<I>S,</I> 22-23]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Bohemia has become "a sort of game preserve for the wealthy classes"
(<I>S,</I> 315), and images of pimps and procurement hover in Marriott's
text as metaphors for the prostitution of art by dealers, by fashionable,
shallow, and sensation-seeking patrons, and by an opportunistic
avant-garde.

<P>
While Marriott's reservations may owe something to his Arts-and-Crafts
Christian Socialism, and a certain reforming zeal, a similar complaint
is made by the characters in Gilbert Cannan's <I>Mendel.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 At the Merlin's Cave, the painters Logan and Mendel
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 find a commissionaire at the door, a book to be signed, and silk-lined
 overcoats and opera hats in the cloakroom. Two young men in immaculate
 evening dress follow them in, looking "slightly self-conscious and
 ashamed of themselves" (<I>M,</I> 236), and Mendel wonders, "Why did they
 come there if they were ashamed? and why did they expect an Asmodean
 lewdness of an artists' club, they for whom the flesh-markets of the
 music-hall promenades existed?" (<I>M,</I> 236) When Mendel's friend and
 model Jessie Petrie asks him what he thinks of the place--"I suppose if
 the swells come it'll be a success, but they do spoil it"--he agrees,
 "Yes. They spoil everything" (<I>M,</I> 238).

<P>
Ford Madox Ford, describing 1914 from the distance of 1923, is more
benign. Mme. Strindberg is "a kind, voluptuous, abstracted creature
. . . very benevolent to innumerable young men with steeple-crowned hats
and black side whiskers"
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 and someone who, as he counselled the exasperated Lewis in 1913,
 "is trying to build up a palace of all the Arts with three oyster
 shells and stale patchouli and sawdust and creme and verse libre and
 champagne corks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Ford later recalled writing a shadow-play for the Cabaret--<I>ombres
 chinoises</I> had been one of the glories of the Chat Noir
<BR>
--and it is tempting to see it as the basis for his account of the
shadow-play in <I>The Marsden Case.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>
 The narrator is sunk at his marble table during the preparations;
 the young man who has designed the silhouettes passes "swiftly before
 the screen, a cardboard box beneath his cape, himself a silhouette"
 (<I>MC,</I> 90); and then the lights are switched on, revealing
 "a terrific white wooden pillar like a beaked man with a scarlet
 tongue" (<I>MC,</I> 92), and all around white caryatids with "scarlet
 details, the heads of hawks, cats, camels, and the white of their paint
 [giving] small shining reflections" (<I>MC,</I> 92). Clarice Honeywill,
 a diseuse who is "a true Tragic muse with an awful voice in which every
 word [is] clearer than type," performs while "non-representational
 snakes, assassins, and harem-grilles" (<I>MC,</I> 128) wriggle across
 the illuminated sheet. She brings the house down. The "Guardees and
 stockbrokers and German Jews" (<I>MC,</I> 129) demand an encore, and
 London loses "a great diseuse" (<I>MC,</I> 130), as she is "swept
 up into the footlights of blessed and stereotyped inanities and did
 the same thing night after night for a thousand nights, literally"
 (<I>MC,</I> 130).
<SUP><a NAME="REF81" HREF="#FOOT81">81</a></SUP>
 And we will never know if Lewis was the young man in the cape, and if
 this was the same occasion as his "Painter-Poet's Night" in October
 1913, an event that led him to write to his friend Cuthbert Hamilton
 of the "shadow-picture bustle" and of his concern that the "beastly
 Cabaret, that has been the cause of so many ridiculous vexations to me,
 . . . [should not] add lessening of our good camaraderie to the number
 of its senseless misdeeds" (<I>L,</I> 46).

Early in 1914 the club closed down. There had been financial difficulties
and the artists had not been paid. (In April 1913 Mme. Strindberg offered
Ginner and Gore her Augustus John paintings, drawings, and etchings in
settlement of &#163;535, once she had un-mortgaged them; Lewis took his
money out of the till.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF83" HREF="#FOOT83">83</a></SUP>
 The club's minute books make mysterious references to libels and
 scandals, and the club was raided by police because nonmembers were
 purchasing food and drink in breach of the regulations. A creditors'
 meeting had been arranged as early as July 1913, but Mme. Strindberg
 seems to have evaded the noose until February 1914, when a liquidation
 sale took place. (The furniture was sold for &#163;80 and the "good
 will" for &#163;10 [<I>ABG,</I> 113].)
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 In April 1914, apparently still trading, she was fined &#163;160 with
 the option of two month's imprisonment for selling wine, beer, spirits,
 and tobacco without a licence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF85" HREF="#FOOT85">85</a></SUP>
 In May the same magistrate, for the same offence, "ordered the Cabaret
 Club to be struck off the register, and directed that the premises
 should not be used as a club for the next five years."
<SUP><a NAME="REF86" HREF="#FOOT86">86</a></SUP>

<P>
The <I>Sketch</I> ran a series on the new supper clubs for dining and
tango dancing (the Lotus, Murray's, and the Four Hundred Club), but
there were no outr&eacute; decorations, no cabaret turns, no avant-garde
company. This was followed in July by an article on the Crab Tree Club,
on Greek Street, with which John was associated. This was artier than
the supper clubs and full of young women with bobbed hair and red
neckerchiefs, but only as masquerade.
<SUP><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></SUP>
 In April, on the rebound from the Cabaret Theatre Club and the Omega
 Workshops, Lewis founded the Rebel Art Centre with Kate Lechmere, whose
 idea it was, as codirector and source of capital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></SUP>
 The Cubist Art Centre, as it was also known, was several things
 at once. It was an art school (costing five guineas a quarter; with
 instruction in various applied arts including the painting of screens,
 fans, lampshades, and scarves available if required; Mr. Lewis to
 visit as professor five days a week). It was a workshop for painters
 and craftsmen who could "bring their work and go on with it, if this
 atmosphere is congenial. . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 It was a place for lectures, performances, and public discussion, with
 talks to be given by Pound and Marinetti, a <I>Blast</I> evening and
 addresses given "to the sound of carefully chosen trumpets"; short plays,
 <I>ombres chinoises,</I> and lectures by Arnold Schoenberg and Alexander
 Scriabin were promised. Finally, it was an avant-garde environment:
 "the only room in Europe where artists belonging to the New movement
 in art have had so free a hand, and done work on this scale." But it
 was scarcely a social center; it had no dining facilities, no cabaret
 turns, and no tango teas. The stockbrokers and tradesmen were left
 behind, but at some cost: almost nobody came. The avant-garde cabaret
 experiment was over and its principal components disassembled into
 the Rebel Art Centre (which quickly faded), the dance-and-supper clubs
 (which sprang up everywhere), and the music hall (which enjoyed a final
 flourish with the coming of revue).

<B>The Alhambra, 1912: <I>Kill That Fly!</I></B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
<I>A Day in Paris</I>  was a music-hall ballet. <I>Kill That
Fly!</I>  was a music-hall revue. Between 1908 and 1912 the
metropolitan halls were developing into

<B></B>

"palaces of variety," and revue helped broaden their audience and extend
their appeal, while "killing with refinement" the music hall as Victorian
audiences had known it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 The impact of revue, together with that of the Russian Ballet and
 American song and dance forms, eclipsed the long tradition of music-hall
 ballet. The last in-house work at the Alhambra was staged in 1912 and at
 the Empire in 1915, but already in 1912, as one critic commented, above
 and beyond revue hung the shadow of cinema, where "by the expenditure of
 the humble sixpence . . . one can for a couple of hours run through the
 gamut of all the histrionic emotions--tragedy, comedy, farce, scenic
 effect, melodrama, and illustrations of Nature's marvels hitherto
 undreamt of."
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>

<P>
"Revue" was a term adopted from the French for a dramatic "review of
the year," satirizing topical events and personalities in loosely linked
scenes of dialogue and song. It became both increasingly spectacular, with
lavish costumes, sets, and chorus numbers, and increasingly parodic,
offering not only burlesques of current events, popular fashions,
and well-known individuals but also parodies of both "high" art forms
and rival performers. Extravagant spectacles with long-legged chorus
lines made an easy appeal to popular taste (and to the new bourgeois
audience for variety and revue), even while the audience for Shirley
Kellogg in <I>Hullo Ragtime!</I> at the London Hippodrome in 1912 had
to get the point of Ethel Levey's impersonation of Anna Pavlova in "The
Baccanale Rag." Kellogg and Levey appeared in the 1913 follow-up revue,
<I>Hullo Tango!,</I> with costumes by L&eacute;on Bakst, the designer
for the Russian Ballet. Levey appeared in one scene as Countess Zicka in
"Hiplomacy," a parody of Victorien Sardou's <I>Diplomacy;</I> in another
scene, in a startlingly self-referential bit of business, Harry Tate
gave an impersonation of how George Robey would play Tate's own sketch
"Golfing." <I>Hullo . . . London!</I> by George Grossmith at the Empire
Theatre in 1910 included a skit on Lady Constance Stewart-Richardson,
the aristocratic "Grecian" dancer in the style of Isadora Duncan. <I>All
Change Here</I> at the Alhambra in 1911 offered a burlesque of Richard
Strauss's <I>Elektra</I> at Covent Garden.
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>
 This is all to say that the contemporary audience was sufficiently
 familiar with current developments in the music hall, the Russian Ballet,
 opera, the legitimate theatre, and popular music, to get the references.
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 But at the same time the increasingly lavish productions of "spectacular"
 revue, derived from America, were smothering the sharpness, pace, and
 irony of "intimate" revue, closer to cabaret and derived from Paris.
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>

<P>
<I>Kill That Fly!,</I> "a new and original review by George Grossmith,"
opened at the Alhambra on 14 October 1912.
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>
 The scene set in the Metropolitan Cabaret was a skit on the Cave of the
 Golden Calf: a popular cultural spoof of the avant-garde; and almost,
 if not quite, a "spectacular" spoof of an "intimate" revue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 The phrase "kill that fly" was "a Yankeeism which implies having a
 flip at anything that may be making a buzz"; the revue touched "gaily
 and without offence upon nearly every subject of the period--Politics,
 the Stage, Eugenics, Fashions in Costume and in Dancing, Society, the
 Exhibitions, and so on and so on"
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 (though to the relief of another critic, not on those now-tedious
 topics, the "Suffragists, the Insurance Act . . . the revolt of

<B></B>

the doctors, the Balkan War, and Home Rule").
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
 <I>Kill That Fly!</I> was one of the first revues to benefit from the
 Lord Chamberlain's relaxation of rules governing music-hall performance,
 and to stage satirical characterizations of the politicians Asquith,
 Lloyd George, and Reginald McKenna as well as skits on George Edwardes
 (the manager of the Empire), Gaby Deslys, and the composer Oscar Straus.

<P>
Discussing the Parisian context, Weiss has pointed out that revue
depends on topicality, allusion, and parody, in the form of a
"jumbling and splicing of current events" into a rapid succession of
loosely linked scenes (<I>PC,</I> 30). Its heterogeneity and lack of
a framing narrative link it to newspapers and collage. Both collage
and revue aestheticize the elisions of newspaper syntax, so that to
"practice the revue in any form [is] . . . to cultivate an aesthetic of
the newspaper," the essential context and subtext of the revue genre
(<I>PC,</I> 18). In Weiss's definition, revue is to be understood as
"a comic system according to which . . . society commentated itself"
(<I>PC,</I> 36). In Britain as in Paris, a loosely understood "cubism,"
or as of 1912 "futurism," or some such phrase as "modern art" was a topic
for newspapers and music hall alike: one more sign of the times, one
more source of parody. But at the same time music-hall revue, with its
puns and allusions and spliced topicalities, its fondness for ragtime and
spectacle and punctured pretensions, offered a quotidian touchstone for
a certain kind of modernist aesthetic. This was the "enormous, jangling,
journalistic, fairy desert of modern life" that served the artist "as

 Or as Lewis put it elsewhere, "Folk Art, along with Music Hall Songs,
 and authors of Pagliaccis, Viennese Waltzes, etc., is very seducing
 and certainly the next best thing to Bach. (The officially 'serious'
 artists of any time, who practise 'le grand Art,' come well below
 'My Home in Dixie.')"

The vernacular and the popular are sources of invigoration for
an avant-garde that wants to mark its distance from the diluted
naturalisms, symbolisms, and impressionisms of fin-de-si&egrave;cle
bourgeois culture, and stake its claim to modernity through a newly
expressive formal vocabulary allied to a keen sensibility toward
the textures and experience of everyday life. Nevertheless, the move
toward the vernacular or the popular is, in Lewis's terms, a careful
discrimination made with a new elite culture in mind. "We don't want
to-day things made entirely of gold (but gold mixed with flint or grass,
diamond with paste, etc.). . . . But the condition of our enjoyment of
vulgarity, discord, cheapness or noise is an unimpaired and keen disgust
with it. . . . Rare and cheap, fine and poor, these contrasts are the
male and female, the principle of creation to-day."

The topicality of the avant-garde brought Mme. Strindberg added publicity
and a return on her investment in avant-garde artists. Once the Cabaret
Theatre Club had entered the public domain, or once the press had turned
it into a (distinctively visual) reference point for a larger audience
than had ever frequented the club, it was ripe for parody in music-hall
revue. The <I>Sunday Referee</I> complained that <I>Kill That Fly!</I>
was at times "a little too intimate, perhaps, for anybody but the man
about town," but the press was happy to spell out references, and the
<I>Sketch</I> reproduced a photograph of the Metropolitan Cabaret scene,
clearly labelling it "A Skit on the

<B></B>

Cave of the Calf."
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 The circularity of the connections between publicity, performance,
 the avant-garde, and urban themes in modernist painting, can
 be neatly tracked through a clipping from the Paris newspaper
 <I>Actualit&eacute;,</I> with its photograph of a "Cabaret de Cubistes
 &agrave; Londres": in the background is Lewis's drop-curtain for the
 Cave of the Calf.
<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>
 <I>Actualit&eacute;</I> also ran a painting of Piccadilly Circus,
 rendered in a hard-edged, sardonic, cartoon-like style, loosely
 compatible with the cabaret manner of Ginner and Gore. Charles Ginner's
 <I>Piccadilly Circus</I> , now in the Tate Gallery, is clearly
 distinct; this piece is probably one of the two posters Mme. Strindberg
 commissioned from the artist along with wall decorations for the
 Cave. Most of the image's middle ground is taken up with the Clapham
 omnibus, and most of the omnibus is occupied by a large advertisement
 for the "new Alhambra revue." Any time after 14 October, this would have
 been <I>Kill That Fly!,</I> with its skit on the Cabaret Theatre Club.

It might even be the case, allowing for theatrical license and the
constraints of a proscenium stage, that photographs of <I>Kill That
Fly!</I> contain further clues as to what the Cave looked like (<A
HREF="4.2tickner_5.html"> 5</A>); the "A. E. Craven" who designed
the sets was well acquainted with the Cave of the Golden Calf.
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>
 Obviously the high frontal sets could not reproduce the smoky, intimate
 ambience of the basement Cave. There is no sign of Epstein's "barbaric"
 plaster carvings that clothed the supporting iron columns, although
 in the scene of "Miss Muriel Hudson singing her rag-time medley" there
 are two squat, shaven-headed, Eastern-looking idols seated

<B></B>

on either side of the back doorway.
<SUP><a NAME="REF106" HREF="#FOOT106">106</a></SUP>
 Other features, however, are readily identifiable. Gill's calf appears
 three times: at the back of the stage on the right; in relief above
 the curtained central door (with the word "Troglodytes" attached to
 it); and again above the door on the left. Ginner's triptych in the
 Cave is directly reproduced in the wall painting at the back, but
 inserted into it are two jagged, irregular forms and the re of a
 performer strongly reminiscent of Gore's <I>A Singer at the Bedford
 Music Hall</I> of 1912. The frieze above loosely follows the jungle
 theme and cartoon-like style of Ginner's <I>Oil Study for Tiger-Hunting
 Mural in the Cave of the Golden Calf.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF107" HREF="#FOOT107">107</a></SUP>
 Above the "Cabaret Cosmopolitan" poster at the back left is a hieroglyph
 based on Lewis's three-headed calf design for the "Cabaret Theatre
 Club" brochure. (The two res on either side have been separated
 out so that the overall shape is no longer as compact; the features
 on the left have been orientalized, and those on the right made more
 conventionally feminine.)

<P>
Above the right-hand door are three res at a table, with Lewis's
characteristic, jagged-edged diagonals, and what appear to be ominous,
Gauguinesque birds in the foreground. On the left-hand side of the
photograph, Lewis's seated female (at the top) and dancing res
(below) are taken from the "Programme" and the "Cabaret Theatre Club"
brochure. (Craven probably took them directly from the publicity; Lewis
is unlikely to have scaled them up as wall decorations himself or they
would have been mentioned in the club's publicity for its second season,
opening at precisely this moment, on 15 October.) Between them hangs
a painting with something like the motif of ships on a wedge of sea
from Gore's studies for his deer-hunting mural, and on the left side
of the set, above the door and calf, quite clearly if inexplicably,
is Frederick Etchells's <I>The Dead Mole,</I> exhibited at the second
Post-Impressionist Exhibition in 1912 and reproduced in its catalog
(this angle does not appear in  5).

<P>
The Metropolitan Cabaret scene appears to reproduce accurately the loosely
knit program of the Cabaret Theatre Club, with its odd division between
the pagan, "primitive" jungle themes of Epstein, Gill, Ginner, and Gore;
as well as what Violet Hunt recalled as Lewis's "raw meat designs":
"Bismarckian images, severings, disembowellings, mixed pell-mell with
the iron shards that did it, splashed with the pale blood of exhausted
heroes."

 There was more than a touch of irony here, so Craven's sets were, perhaps
 unwittingly, doubly parodic. One <I>Observer</I> critic (P. G. Konody

this group of artistic revolutionaries upon the happy title which
has been bestowed upon and accepted by them. The "Troglodytes," or
"Cave-dwellers," is a singularly appropriate appellation for a coterie
of artists, who are not only connected with the "Cave of the Calf," but
who aim--most of them--at the primitive simplicity of the days when art
was in its infancy. . . . on bones and on the walls of caves. . . .

The irony may have been lost on the casual visitor. The Rocking Horse Club
in Marriott's <I>Subsoil</I> was "named after an innocent illustration
in art-criticism which had raised a storm of mingled derision and
enthusiastic assent about the writer's

<B></B>

 ears" (<I>S,</I> 9). The reference is clearly to the catalog of the
 first Post-Impressionist exhibition in which Desmond MacCarthy, writing
 from Fry's notes, claimed that "a good rocking-horse is more like a
 horse than the snapshot of a Derby winner"; the same essay suggested
 that Post-Impressionism was symptomatic of a "return to primitive, even
 perhaps of a return to barbaric art."

 Cork may not be wrong to suggest that on one level the jungle scenes
 offered "a fitting location for the primal emotions they wanted to
 unleash" (<I>ABG,</I> 68), but it seems possible that he misses the
 sarcasm: a gleeful fastening on the notion of the primitive as a now
 ubiquitous critical term, lapped up by a shallow and gullible audience
 prepared to rehearse their modernist litany without too much care for
 the paintings it served.

The dance was a favorite theme of artists and poets from the 1880s to
World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF112" HREF="#FOOT112">112</a></SUP>
 But Edvard Munch's dance of life or W. B. Yeats's symbolist identity of
 dancer and dance, the art nouveau line of La Goulue or Loie Fuller, the
 rapturous roses of fin-de-si&egrave;cle decadence at the Empire ballet,
 even Matisse's <I>La Danse,</I> have little in common with Lewis's
 fascination with the "primitive" and the machine. Lewis depicts res
 in a dance that is vigorous, acrobatic, and highly expressive. Arms
 are raised above the head; knees and elbows are akimbo; torsos are
 twisted; and features are fixed, mask-like, and grim. We can at least
 be confident of what it is <I>not</I>--languid, decorous, fluid or
 balletic--and confident too that this is more than just an unforeseen
 consequence of Lewis's chosen style. Bearing in mind the social and
 pictorial relations between sexuality, modernity, and the dance, we
 may ask: What were the dances popular at the time and danced at the
 Cabaret Theatre Club; and what was the point (and the <I>work</I>) of
 the dance as a referent in Lewis's pictorial strategies?

<P>
Between about 1910 and 1914 there was an explosion of interest in all
forms of dance--vernacular, theatrical, and social.
<SUP><a NAME="REF113" HREF="#FOOT113">113</a></SUP>
 Folk dances were energetically collected, photographed and
 revived. Theatrical and ballet conventions were overturned by dancers
 like Isadora Duncan and the Russian Ballet. On the dance floor, the
 previously daring "Do you reverse?" paled beside risqu&eacute; new dances
 like the tango, the two-step, and the Brazilian maxixe. These forms
 leaked into each other: the tango reached London from Paris via <I>The
 Sunshine Girl</I> at the Gaiety Theatre in 1912; professionals gave
 theatrical displays of the flamenco or tarantella; the professional tango
 dancers Irene and Vernon Castle gave demonstrations at social dances
 or shared the bill with the Russian Ballet at Deauville Casino; and the
 Parisian apache dance, posing as an urban vernacular, became a popular
 spectacle in music halls and cabarets. Dance societies and classes were
 formed; journals, sheet music, and books were published; tango teas
 were instituted everywhere; and ragtime became a craze. Augustus John
 wrote to John Quinn, "I haven't got the Tango-craze yet but I have a
 dance now and then; rag-time can't be resisted."

Although <I>Kermesse</I> itself is lost, there are several gouache studies
associated with it, and similar themes in Lewis's other designs for the
club including stationery,

<B></B>

menus, a poster, and a program cover. This corpus of works includes
the Yale <I>Kermesse</I> (M72), <I>The Dancers </I>(Study for
<I>Kermesse?</I>) (M48), the <I>Design for a Programme Cover--Kermesse</I>
(M52), <I>Dancer</I> (M47), <I>Lovers</I> (M74), <I>A Wall Decoration

<I>Abstract Design</I> (M29).
<SUP><a NAME="REF115" HREF="#FOOT115">115</a></SUP>
 They constitute a recognizable subgroup among Lewis's works of 1912,
 having in common a cubo-futurist mode of drawing, a set of thematic
 references to dance and festivity, and a direct or inferential link to
 the Cave of the Golden Calf.

Lewis's works of 1912 refer to a variety of contemporary dance
forms. <I>Lovers,</I> as we have seen, derives from Dearly's and
Mistinguett's apaches. The <I>Wall Decoration in the Cave of the Golden
Calf</I> may owe something to the influence of Diaghilev's dancers <I>en
point</I> (the Russian Ballet had its first London season in 1911).
<SUP><a NAME="REF116" HREF="#FOOT116">116</a></SUP>
 <I>The Dancers</I> seem to hold drapery or veils (see the cover
 illustration of this issue): Salomes were ubiquitous in this period
<SUP><a NAME="REF117" HREF="#FOOT117">117</a></SUP>
 and the Cave advertised "veil dances" in 1912, but the connection
 may be to <I>The Nautch Girl,</I> with Indian costumes designed by
 Albert Rothenstein, performed in June 1912. (The conventional delicacy
 of Rothenstein's watercolor costume-study, reproduced in the Cave's
 publicity, has perhaps blinded us to the link between this work and
 <I>The Dancers.</I>) The Yale <I>Kermesse</I> is different again
 (<A HREF="4.2tickner_6.html"> 6</A>). A <I>Sunday Times</I>
 reviewer praised as the best item on the

<B></B>

program a Spanish dancer "fraught with the spirit of Spain and the
passion of the Latin blood. Not for a long time has a male dancer, whose
art is not academic but intuitive, roused so much enthusiasm among an
audience, many of whom were <I>connoisseurs</I> and <I>gourmets</I> of
choreographic art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF118" HREF="#FOOT118">118</a></SUP>
 Lewis was in Spain in 1902, 1908, and 1910; the raised arms, ferocious
 expressions, and ecstatic rhythm of the Yale <I>Kermesse</I> do invoke
 something like flamenco and the patterned, almost mechanical beat
 of stamping feet and castanets. The Breton costumes, however, put
 it in Brittany, and the "Preliminary Prospectus" promised "a scene
 from a Breton 'Wake'" along with coster dances and dances from Goya's
 "Caprichos" on the opening night.
<SUP><a NAME="REF119" HREF="#FOOT119">119</a></SUP>

<P>
In the Yale <I>Kermesse</I> the sense of sexual abandon is menacing. Even
in the study we can not watch the performance with impunity; the spectator
in Brodzky's drypoint would have been engulfed by it. The central couple
advances threateningly, a demented arthropod with limbs akimbo, its face
a mask of fury, a voracious puppet with the appetite of a praying mantis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF120" HREF="#FOOT120">120</a></SUP>
 The man on the left raises a glass; two more lie overturned on the
 countertop, and in a flurry of angular pen-strokes we can make out
 his legs and shoes drumming at the ground below. A skirted re
 leaps screaming into the frame on the right with the drink held in an
 outstretched arm streaming in a solid arc down to her head. If this
 is a dance it is somehow a dance of danger and death, an impression
 enhanced by the blue-white shards (all pleated metal and sharpened
 blades and broken glass); by the tyro-like dentistry and up-flung arm
 of the re on the right; by the characteristically crosshatched,
 lobster-claw ellipses; by the white wings of light, offsetting with
 their upward sweep the orchestration of curves and blades below; and by
 the force with which Lewis has scratched and gouged the lines across
 his washes and into the surface of the paper. It is very difficult to
 read this image more benignly, and one critic who admired its vigorous
 geometry nevertheless claimed that it was less like a peasant carnival
 than the tournament scene from <I>Ivanhoe</I> or "some terrible battle
 of extermination between murderous insects."
<SUP><a NAME="REF121" HREF="#FOOT121">121</a></SUP>
 <I>Design for a Programme Cover--Kermesse</I> appears to re a sexual
 assault. <I>The Dancers,</I> with some lessening of hostilities, confirms
 the theme of penetration, partly through the re-ground relation
 in all these pictures. Pound once praised Vorticism for giving him new
 eyes, for showing him the shapes between things and the wedges of sky
 between the roofs of houses; here the wedges attack the roofs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF122" HREF="#FOOT122">122</a></SUP>
 There is no background, only intersecting planes where, in contrast with
 cubism proper, the manner of intersection is violently rendered. The
 nonral shapes, where we can distinguish them, thrust into, dissect,
 and abrade the combatants in a manner that echos the etched scars of
 Lewis's pen.

<P>
The point is not that the Lewisian dance was simply a stylized
illustration of any particular contemporary dance, or that there is
a simple correspondence between salon painting and the sylvan ballet
or ballroom waltz, on the one hand, and between Lewis's brand of
cubo-futurism and the tango, flamenco, or apache dance on the other. I
mean instead that there were certain intense sympathies between the
Latin histories, myths, rhythms, and overtly erotic movements of
such dances--Quinn in a letter to Augustus John called tango dancing
"homeopathic fornication"
<SUP><a NAME="REF123" HREF="#FOOT123">123</a></SUP>
--and Lewis's

<B></B>

apparent desire to move in and out of the hinterland of abstraction,
retaining the re as a sexualized body, but splintering his forms,
integrating re and ground, reducing (though by no means eliminating)
the signifiers of sexual difference. He <I>stages</I> an encounter
between violence and sexuality, all the while refusing absolutely the
coy fleshiness of the salon nude in favour of something more imperious
but mechanical.

<P>
Here Lewis had his peers in mind as well. His combative personality was
such that he needed "a network of enmity and opposition . . . to have
a sense of himself as a creative and coherent personality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF124" HREF="#FOOT124">124</a></SUP>
 Part of that network can be found in the work and influence of Duncan,
 Diaghilev, and &Eacute;mile Jaques-Dalcroze. The "connoisseurs and
 gourmets of choreographic art" at the Cabaret Theatre Club--indeed any
 attentive newspaper reader--would have been familiar with them all.

Isadora Duncan "radically altered ideas about the potential of the

 Margaret Morris, who appeared at the Cabaret Theatre Club with her

Fergusson was the art editor of <I>Rhythm</I> magazine and a great

range of Balkan and Near Eastern sources in pursuit of effects that were
voluptuously decorative and at times scandalously erotic. <I>Rhythm</I>
was influenced by Henri Bergson and fauvism, and its writers and

Lewis favoured something sparer, harder, and more directly red
as sexual combat. His sexual aesthetic was phallic, homophobic, and
(ambivalently) misogynist. His Cabaret res are amazons who part
their thighs and tilt their pelvises with studied provocation. Duncan
and Morris were too self-absorbed for Lewis; their "neo-Greekness"--the
bare feet and fluttering draperies--was to invoke an expressive and
spontaneous femininity, and was therefore alien to the Vorticist men.
<SUP><a NAME="REF131" HREF="#FOOT131">131</a></SUP>
 Classicism literally wasn't their line. Henri Gaudier-Brzeska
 specifically associated the soft contours of the Hellenic tradition
 with a debased aesthetic, placing himself in what he saw as the tougher,
 more instinctual, and phallic lineage of the tribal and "barbaric." He
 also made the particular connection between Greek sculpture and

<B></B>

"Greek love."
<SUP><a NAME="REF132" HREF="#FOOT132">132</a></SUP>
 Among cognoscenti at the time, the homosexuality or sexual ambiguity
 of Diaghilev and his leading artists was well known. And with the
 Russian Ballet (particularly through the impact of L&eacute;on Bakst
 on the designer Poiret) the world of ballet erupted into the world of
 fashion. Both the covert homosexuality and the explicit (and "feminine")
 fashionability of the Ballet, together with <I>Rhythm</I>'s enthusiasm
 for it and the terms in which that was expressed, grated on Lewis's
 sensibilities. His sympathies lay elsewhere: broadly, on the side of
 the masculine, the mechanical, the abstract, and the engineered, as
 opposed to the Bakst-Poiret-Matisse axis described by Peter Wollen as the
 alternative trajectory never developed, but never entirely repressed,
 in modernism's myth of its own origins: a liminal art of eroticism,
 exoticism, decoration, and the body.

One can not imagine Lewis as a student of eurhythmics, the system of
rhythmical bodily movements advocated by Dalcroze that emphasized the link
between dance and health. Dalcroze's Institut opened in a Dresden suburb
in 1911, and in 1912 <I>The Eurhythmics of Emile Jaques Dalcroze</I>
was published in English, replete with illustrations of various "plastic
exercises" and an essay by Michael Sadler on "The Value of Eurhythmics
to Art."
<SUP><a NAME="REF134" HREF="#FOOT134">134</a></SUP>
 All this would have been known to John Fergusson when he painted <I>Les
 Eus</I> ("The well people," or "The healthy ones") in 1911-12
 (<A HREF="4.2tickner_7.html"> 7</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF135" HREF="#FOOT135">135</a></SUP>
 The peculiar title, though invented by

<B></B>

Fergusson, derives from Dalcroze. The rather heavy-handed <I>la
ronde</I> amid luxuriant vegetation, a transparently modern fantasy
of an ancient fertility rite, is indebted to Duncan, Dalcroze, and
possibly Diaghilev. It sums up pictorially <I>Rhythm</I>'s obsession
with dance as an art form, and with rhythm as the condition to which
all art aspires. Lewis probably didn't know it before 1914, when it
was shown at the Dor&eacute; Galleries, and perhaps not even then. It
would be hard to prove that Lewis intended <I>Kermesse,</I> among other
things, as a rebuff to <I>Les Eus</I> specifically, but not that it was
directed against <I>Rhythm</I>'s Bergsonian vitalism in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF136" HREF="#FOOT136">136</a></SUP>
 For <I>Rhythm,</I> as for Dalcroze, energy expressed in patterned
 movement was a symbol of life, health, and sanity (an implicit reproach
 to Max Nordau and the view of modernism as a symptom of cultural
 degeneracy). Such female nudes as Fergusson's <I>Rhythm,</I> <I>La
 Force,</I> and <I>Torse de Femme</I> portray buxom women as the source
 of natural fecundity; they are the allegorical embodiment of Bergson's
 <I>&eacute;lan vital.</I> Lewis's res are demonic rather than
 eurhythmic, and they are far from promising what Michael Sadler looked
 for in Hellerau: "a new and more harmonious race, almost a realization
 of Rousseau's ideal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF137" HREF="#FOOT137">137</a></SUP>

<P>
<I>Kermesse</I> is an urgent reworking of the fauve dance as it had been
inherited from the symbolists as an emblem both of the dance of life and
of the "thinking body." For Lewis, life is combat, the body doesn't think,
and dance isn't the easy expression of Bergsonian vitality. Dalcroze
and Fergusson are too blandly Bergsonian; Diaghilev too fashionable,
voluptuous, and sexually ambiguous; Duncan and Morris too solipsistic,
their Hellenism thematically antimodern and carrying the distant echo
of classical homosexuality. The Latin or "negro" rhythms of the tango,
the tarantella, the flamenco, and ragtime are by contrast flamboyantly
demotic and hot-bloodedly heterosexual. When <I>Blast</I> speaks of
the Vortex that "will not hear of anything but its disastrous polished
dance," it is neither Duncan, Diaghilev, nor Dalcroze who comes to mind.

</H3>

<P>
At the end of November 1913, Edward Marsh wrote to a friend, "Another
new light whom I met today is Wyndham Lewis. (I am going to the Picture
Ball, if you please, as a futurist picture designed by him!) He is very
magnificent to look at, but I don't think he liked me, and I suspected
him of pose, so we shan't make friends."
<SUP><a NAME="REF139" HREF="#FOOT139">139</a></SUP>
 Shortly after the ball took place Marsh received a letter from
 D. H. Lawrence, avid for news of both it and the Lewis costume: "How
 did you look, futuristically? Lord, you're a bit of a jig-saw puzzle
 to start with, mixing poets and pictures, the Admiralty, and what-not,
 like somebody shuffling cards."
<SUP><a NAME="REF140" HREF="#FOOT140">140</a></SUP>
 Trivial in itself, the Albert Hall Picture Ball is nevertheless an
 exemplary instance of high society's assimilation of the popular culture
 of modern art and of Lewis's part in it. This moment of absorption
 depended on an extension of Futurist elements from the gallery into
 fashion, d&eacute;cor, and entertainment--not quite the same thing as a
 Futurist dissolution of art into life but briefly consonant with it. It
 depended too on the emergence of a fancy-dress craze spanning artists'
 revels and fashionable balls, in which competitive participants

<B></B>

distinguished themselves from the common ruck of historical, Old Master,
or commedia dell'arte res by their enthusiasm for dressing out
of Post-Impressionist paintings, &agrave; la Diaghilev, as Futurists,

 The caption explains that one represents "The Birth of Futurism" and one
 "The Culmination of Futurism," and certainly the three res on the
 upper right, with

<B></B>

their more angular stances and boxy costumes, bear witness to the
impact of cubism on the milder Futurism to the left. Somewhere here, but
unidentifiable, lurks Eddie Marsh. Lewis is present at least symbolically
in the masked re whose dark and mustachioed features bear a striking
resemblance to his own. The page as a whole evokes the context, with its
illustrations of friends and family parties arrayed as Italian Primitives,
or the Dutch School, or res from an Egyptian frieze, and in this
company the Futurist costumes seem to pack a certain subversive punch. But
the extended captions are dense with Lords, Ladies, and Honourables and
with (mostly feminine) names familiar from the overlapping circles of art,
society, and politics (Lavery, Tennant, Asquith). "Futurism" was quite at
home in this company, or at least its domesticated variants were, exuding
as they did the pleasantly pungent whiff of lingering controversy. The
Futurist groups were not a disruptive or even mischievous contribution
from beyond the pale of the historical canon or the charmed circle of the
chief participants, but a witty update commissioned by Lady Muriel Paget,
honorary secretary of the charity ball, a well-known social re, a
regular supporter of the avant-garde, and, as the <I>Tatler</I> noted,
a very capable tangoist.

as I had more on my hands than I knew how to cope with, I was at the

Two drafts of undated letters to Lady Muriel Paget survive in Lewis's
correspondence at Cornell. In what is presumably the first he writes,
"It occurred to me after I had left you that I should have advised you
not to show the two sketches to people destined to impersonate res in
them, unless they were peculiarly imaginative and d&eacute;brouillards."

This note reminds us of two things. In October of 1913 Lewis had fallen
out with Roger Fry and the Omega Workshops but not yet with Nevinson and
Marinetti. (Nevinson was an ally in his opposition to Bloomsbury and in
the opening months of

<B></B>

1914 a colleague in the planning of <I>Blast</I> and the opening of the
Rebel Art Centre; the break with Nevinson and Marinetti would come over
the publication of their joint <I>Manifesto of Vital English Art</I> in
June). Lewis probably needed to earn some money, but if his costumes are
in any sense a parody of Futurism, it is affectionate and, as it were,
from the inside. Secondly, as in the relations between the avant-garde and
popular entertainment, there is something newly spectacular, journalistic,
even flirtatious, in the alliance between modernists like Lewis and
Nevinson and fashionable aristocrats like Countess Drogheda, Lady
Muriel Paget, and Lady Cunard. There was nothing new about pageants and
fancy-dress parties. What is new is the sense that they have an audience
beyond their participants, that they provide copy and photographs for
the press and can be restaged for new purposes. These are no longer the
more-or-less documentary images of the wealthy and influential en route
to Parliament or Ascot or St. Moritz or the local hunt. Here we have high
society <I>arranging itself</I> in ordered tableaux for consumption by
the readership of the illustrated press.

<P>
The same thing goes on in all of the many images of beautiful women
posed with their children, at their dressing tables, in their newly
designed drawing rooms, among the accoutrements we would now describe as
signifying a lifestyle through patterns of leisure and consumption. It
seems extraordinary, given the power of (bourgeois) concepts of
"womanliness," that this phenomenon was so little commented on. The
contemporaneous spectacle of women taking to the streets in pursuit of
the vote caused apoplexy in the same people whose wives and daughters
were happy to make a spectacle of themselves in the popular press. One
of the few critics to voice an opinion was David Cooper, in the deeply
conservative pages of <I>Modern Man.</I> According to Cooper,

one of the most disquieting and unpleasant symptoms of modern
English society is the disgusting and shameless way in which people
in the position of ladies and gentlemen advertise themselves in
the Press. . . . The woman [<I>sic</I>], of course, are the worst
offenders. Pick up any of the illustrated weeklies and you will find
photographs of titled women, in attire a good deal scantier than
that of Miss Maud Allan as Salome. . . . they expose their charms to
the gaze of the vulgar. They do more; they have not only themselves,
their children, their various possessions, but even their bedrooms
photographed. . . . These women are obsessed with an insensate and
depraved craving for publicity. Snobs themselves, they pander to the most
despicable snobbery. . . . What sort of men are the husbands, fathers,

There is something virulent and almost hysterical about this
conflation of class hatred with misogyny, this lumping together of
spectacle, femininity, consumption, and snobbery as a kind of symbolic
prostitution. But it hits a nerve. Both the production and consumption
of art are, under modern conditions, closely linked to subjectivity. One
of the pleasures and consolations of patronage, for the Medici, say,
in the fifteenth century or for the purchasers of Wedgwood ware in the
eighteenth, derived from its social prestige. The controversies attached
to avant-garde movements

<B></B>

 before World War I, the lack of a public arena (in the traditional
 sense), together with the rise of press interest and a concomitant flurry
 of manifestos raised the stakes in the game of consuming identities. This
 is not to suggest that modernist gambits or the patronage they attracted
 were in some simple sense spurious; rather, that they had (and have)
 different tasks to perform. Bound up with more obviously "painterly"
 issues is an ambiguous and unstable dynamic, involving a relation
 between the artist's differentiation of himself <I>as</I> avant-garde
 and the consumer's identity-
<BR>
in-difference purchased through association and the expression of an
"advanced" taste.

<P>
The process is peculiarly transparent with Lewis, who protests loudly
and in print his successive detachment from the orbits of John, Sickert,
Bloomsbury, and Futurism; and perhaps also with Lady Cunard, Lady Drogheda
("Countess and Futurist: A Patron of the New Decor"),
<SUP><a NAME="REF148" HREF="#FOOT148">148</a></SUP>

 Of course <I>Blast</I> was controversial when it appeared in 1914,
 but several reviewers found it tame, a diluted Futurism. One reviewer
 claimed to have "left it on the sofa in my wife's drawing-room on the

 it among her visitant women-folk was vicious."

"The Spirit of Futurism" was the title for Lewis Baumer's design for a

 Some version of that spirit erupted in clothing, d&eacute;cor,
 typography, theatrical sets, music-hall turns, party favors, dance
 performances, and other aspects of British culture between 1912
 and 1914. As a term, "futurism" was borrowed from Marinetti and his
 associates, stripped of some of its specific aesthetic and political
 content, and used to name a sense of disruption and change in all
 areas of social and cultural life. As Lawrence Rainey puts it, "By a
 kind of metonymy facilitated by the modern newspaper's juxtaposition of
 disparate events, Futurism [became] the cipher of a contemporary crisis"
 ("FT," 198-99). An article in the <I>Tatler</I> accompanying the
 first main impact of Futurism in 1912 and headed "Unrest in the Art
 World" is characteristic.

I wonder whether western Europe is going rapidly mad. Most decidedly it is
getting terribly hysterical. Labour is in blind revolt against Capital,
and Capital is seeking new spectacles with which to regard Labour. Youth
has begun to kick out at Age and modern Womanhood has certainly gone
off her head. Strauss has hurled the fury of his atmospheric discords
into the middle of Music; Debussy has put the extinguisher on Melody,
and it is significant of the signs of the times that last week, when
the Royal Academy had to close its doors for fear that some rampant
petticoat would show her aptitude for voting by smashing pictures, the
Italian Futurists opened an exhibition of their works at the Sackville

<P>
Futurism itself depended on a high public profile, derived partly from
Marinetti's splenetic performances and partly from this association with
revolution (for its supporters) or hysteria (for its detractors). It
drew simultaneously on the resources of popular culture and on this
<I>aube-de-si&egrave;cle</I> sense of change. There was two-way traffic
between Futurism and the music hall. When Edward Marsh heard Marinetti
lecture at the Poetry Bookshop, probably on 18 November 1913, he wrote
to Rupert Brooke that Marinetti was "beyond doubt an extraordinary man,
full of force and fire, with a surprising gift of turgid lucidity,
a full and roaring and foaming flood of indubitable half-truths
. . . [as] a piece of art, I thought it was about on the level of a
very good farmyard-imitation--a supreme music-hall turn" (<I>EM,</I>
295). Marinetti thought highly of the music hall and would have taken this
as a compliment. He performed in small avant-garde contexts such as the
Cabaret Theatre Club, the Poetry Bookshop, and the Dor&eacute; Gallery,
but also staked a claim for the larger spaces and public audiences of
the Bechstein Hall and the Coliseum and, in his 1913 manifesto "The
Variety Theater," for music hall as a paradigmatically Futurist art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF155" HREF="#FOOT155">155</a></SUP>

<P>
Weiss suggests that "The Variety Theater" manifesto has been grossly
neglected and that it contains "virtually a complete repertoire of the
pictorial devices of futurism, most notably the principles of dynamism
and audience participation" (<I>PC,</I> 39). "The music hall," according
to Marinetti, is "naturally anti-academic, primitive, and ingenuous, and
therefore the more significant for the unexpectedness of its experiments
and the simplicity of its means. . . . It destroys the solemn, the
sacred, the serious and the sublime of Art with a capital <I>A</I>"
(<I>SW,</I> 119). Its radical techniques of collage, montage, slapstick,
and parody provided in effect a modern urban aesthetic parallel to the
avant-garde address to city life. The music hall could only be enhanced
by such further Futurist devices as soaping the stage, painting the
actors, and selling several tickets to the same seat. Weiss goes so
far as to suggest that "the subtext of Marinetti's claims appears to
be that futurism itself is virtually an avant-garde counterpart to
recent developments in popular entertainment" (<I>PC,</I> 40), with
both Marinetti and the entertainment daily <I>Comoedia</I> "promoting
music-hall comedy as a force of modernity" (<I>PC,</I> 41).

<P>
Marinetti's own appearance on the music-hall stage in 1914 was not a
success with the audience. He mistook at a stroke the nature of the
context and the possibilities available to him. Futurism in British
variety was a subject <I>for</I> revue, not <I>in</I> revue, and framing
Luigi Russolo's electric noise machines (the <I>intonarumori</I>) at
the Coliseum was not enough to reposition them in some hybrid space as
other than entertainment or art.

Naturally I went to see the first performance, and I must say it was
one of the funniest shows ever put on in London, provided, of course,
that one looked at things from the right angle. Marinetti swaggered on
to that vast stage looking about the size of a house fly, and bowed. As
he spoke no English, there was no time wasted in explanations or in

<B></B>

the preparation of his audience. Had they spoken Italian, I do believe
Marinetti could have magnetized them as he did everybody else. There was
nothing for it, however, but to call upon his ten noise tuners to play,
so they turned handles like those of a hurdy-gurdy. It must have sounded
magnificent to him, for he beamed; but a little way back in the auditorium
all one could hear was the faintest of buzzes. At first the audience
did not understand that this was the performance offered them in return
for their hard-earned cash, but when they did there was one vast, deep,
and long-sustained, "Boo!" . . . When I went round to the back I found
Marinetti in the best of spirits, dismissing the unanimous condemnation
of the audience and calmly announcing to the Press, "C'&eacute;tait un
cabal." For the next performance Stoll introduced a gramophone record by
Elgar to bring a little melody into the act. It helped, and the effort
was received in stony silence. Marinetti described it as a "succ&eacute;s
[<I>sic</I>] fou" [<I>PP,</I> 61-62].

All this came to an abrupt end in August 1914. The artists continued their
activities, distracted or constrained in particular ways by the outbreak
of war, but Marinetti was no longer the caffeine of Europe; Futurists
and apaches (both copies and originals) changed into uniform; and the
avant-garde vanished from the illustrated press. In the <I>Sketch,</I>
the <I>Bystander,</I> the <I>Tatler,</I> and <I>Vanity Fair</I> there is
still material on pantomimes and music halls (with patriotic tableaux)
lightening the dark hours; there are fashion notes and exhortations to
keep the workers working in the fashion and entertainment industries. But
there are no references to Futurism or to fashionable patrons of the
avant-garde. The pages are filled with portraits of young widows, of
officers killed or wounded, of aristocratic women nursing or raising
money for the war effort. Lewis's patron Mary Borden Turner offers
an exemplary case, one no doubt heightened by the apparently intimate
relations between them. On 8 June 1914 she had confirmed the commission
to decorate her drawing room in Park Lane for &#163;250: &#163;100 in
advance and &#163;150 due on completion. ("I understand that you intend
painting six panels for the walls of the room but I leave the scheme of
decorations to you.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF159" HREF="#FOOT159">159</a></SUP>
 In August she thought of buying <I>Slow Attack</I> from an exhibition
 at the Whitechapel Art Gallery. By 31 December, with the panels nearly
 completed, she was uncertain how to proceed since the drawing-room scheme
 had had to be given up, at least temporarily. "I thought possibly in
 the meantime you might like to have them on Exhibition somewhere. People
 ought to have a chance to see them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF160" HREF="#FOOT160">160</a></SUP>
 In May 1915 she sent &#163;35, which brought the total payment to
 &#163;200. She was sorry not to enclose the last &#163;50 for the
 furniture and for decorating the room, but "Every penny I've got is
 going into my hospital."
<SUP><a NAME="REF161" HREF="#FOOT161">161</a></SUP>
 Later she wrote that she had expected to have a very unusual room, but
 that would have meant buying a complete

<B></B>

set of furniture, rugs, lamps, and so on, which was now impossible. She
would leave the walls plain and use her old furniture: "Please believe
that this is a matter of necessity and conscience."

 The next letter is from Dunkirk, dated 16 May [1916]; she is shutting
 up Park Lane and does not know what to do with the pictures, Lewis can
 exhibit them wherever he likes, and does he really want to come over and
 drive an ambulance (does he know anything about driving ambulances)? A
 final note offers a very frosty response to Lewis's request for the
 remaining &#163;50.

Claire Pajaczkowska has argued that just as Marx understood the product of
capitalist economics to be profit rather than commodities, so we should
recognize the "product of the signifying process to be . . . identity
rather than the art object or text."

 Modernism has, for historical reasons, a heightened autobiographical
 component, and "abstraction" may be less formal, or less reticent,
 than it appears. I would argue at the very least that certain forms of
 twentieth-century modernism have had as one of their principal objects
 the assertion of "virility and domination," in Carol Duncan's words, and
 that this assertion has been linked to a crisis in artistic masculinity
 and to the prominence of politically militant women.

Lewis's early writings, beginning in Brittany in the summer of 1908 and
culminating with the collection published as <I>The Wild Body</I> in
1927, can be related to <I>Kermesse,</I> where the drinks and revelry
and Breton hats suggest a local pardon.
<SUP><a NAME="REF166" HREF="#FOOT166">166</a></SUP>
 In notes written in Quimperl&eacute; in 1908 Lewis wrote that the
 peasants go to pardons "consciously with fatalism finding the starting
 point there of their orgies in the clamour, the multitude of the
 f&ecirc;te."
<SUP><a NAME="REF167" HREF="#FOOT167">167</a></SUP>
 The pardons, he insists, are "essentially <I>orgies</I>" dissipating
 the energies that might have fuelled rebellion or creativity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF168" HREF="#FOOT168">168</a></SUP>
 The dancers' Dionysian abandon thus entails abandoning intelligence,
 selfhood, and the detachment necessary for art or protest. It is at
 once vigorous and stupid. Art is opposed to life and--<I>pace</I> the
 symbolists--cannot aspire to the condition of dance. (We may note in
 passing that this view is at odds with the contemporary guidebooks, one
 of which explicitly stated that the Brittany pardons "are not excuses
 for drunken debauches, like the Flemish Kermess").
<SUP><a NAME="REF169" HREF="#FOOT169">169</a></SUP>

<P>
The Brittany stories illustrate what has been called Lewis's concept
of the Wild Body, and its corollary: the repudiation of Bergson and
his reversal of Bergson's theory of humour in <I>Le Rire</I> (1900
[Laughter]). Whereas in Bergson's humanist theory we laugh if we see a
person acting like a thing (or a machine), for Lewis the root of comedy
lies in perceiving a thing behaving like a person (a body behaving like
an intelligence). As Lewis's narrator Ker-Orr puts it in <I>The Wild
Body:</I> "this forked,

<B></B>

strange-scented, blond-skinned gut-bag, with its two bright rolling
marbles with which it sees, bull's eyes full of mockery and madness,
is my stalking-horse. I hang somewhere in its midst operating it with
detachment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF170" HREF="#FOOT170">170</a></SUP>
 The wild body, the physiological system, is the absurd and mechanical
 appendage handcuffed to the laughing observer.

<P>
Drawings like <I>The Vorticist</I>  are often viewed as comments on
modernity, as images of alienated man in the vortex of the modern city
(Foster, above,  8). They can be read that way, and their robotic
look attributed to the dehumanizing effects of modernity. But Lewis was
not a humanist. They serve I think a double and absolutely contradictory
purpose. On the one hand they <I>are</I> dehumanized and their look
of being automata, puppets, or insects, makes them cogs in the social
machine, will-less specks in the crowd or the herd. On the other hand
they represent a <I>desirable</I> dehumanization--and with pregnant
mistresses and venereal disease Lewis had problems with his own wild
body--a tempering and sheathing of the old "forked . . . blond-skinned
gut-bag" into a gleaming new Futurist masculinity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF171" HREF="#FOOT171">171</a></SUP>
 Like Marinetti, Lewis exempted the suffragettes (admired but patronized)
 from a general scorn for femininity. In his Nietzschean manifesto
 "The Code of a Herdsman" he described "women and the processes for
 which they exist" as "the arch conjuring trick."
<SUP><a NAME="REF172" HREF="#FOOT172">172</a></SUP>
 Tarr claims that "Surrender to a woman was a sort of suicide for an
 artist"; and that "soft, quivering and quick flesh is as far from art
 as an object can be."
<SUP><a NAME="REF173" HREF="#FOOT173">173</a></SUP>
 Women are here the death of art and, it is tempting to suggest, the
 revenge of the wild body. In a spectacularly redundant piece of advice
 Lewis's friend Sturge Moore warned him against any woman who used "the
 slop of sex" to trap him: "If [a man] puts his genius between her legs
 she will cover it with any petticoat that takes her fancy and no one
 will see it again."
<SUP><a NAME="REF174" HREF="#FOOT174">174</a></SUP>
 For Lewis all his rivals were enfeebled or in some way feminized. John
 had surrendered to his family romance and was buried in "tribes after
 tribes of archaic and romantic Gitanos and Gitanas."
<SUP><a NAME="REF175" HREF="#FOOT175">175</a></SUP>
 Sickert's low-life nudes squatting listlessly on Camden Town beds were
 squalid and d&eacute;mod&eacute;. Bloomsbury Post-Impressionism was
 the decoration of the "between-men"
<SUP><a NAME="REF176" HREF="#FOOT176">176</a></SUP>
 (and <I>Tarr</I>'s Alan Hobson, the average specimen of the "Cambridge
 set"--a hybrid of the Quaker, the homosexual, and the Chelsea artist).
<SUP><a NAME="REF177" HREF="#FOOT177">177</a></SUP>
 Cubism, more promising, was nevertheless passive before its
 apples and mandolins, producing from its studio props aptly-named
 <I>natures-mortes.</I> Futurist machismo on closer inspection was
 shrouded in Latin romance and so surrendered to the flux.
<SUP><a NAME="REF178" HREF="#FOOT178">178</a></SUP>
 Vorticism alone was hard and clean, unspent--in Pound's phrase, "art
 before it has spread itself into a state of flacidity"
<SUP><a NAME="REF179" HREF="#FOOT179">179</a></SUP>
--an aesthetic of the piston-rod, in Hulme's analogy.

The point is that subjectivity and the dance, primitivism and the machine,
are all about sex and "phallic aesthetics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF181" HREF="#FOOT181">181</a></SUP>
 They are all connected, and they are all unstable. The dance skirts
 femininity; the primitive, a bestial stupidity; the machine, a robotic
 mockery of masculinity. Yet each can be turned to secure the others,
 however contingently, <I>for</I> masculinity. Lewis's res do not
 carry the symbolic weight of gamboling nudity but have tensed anatomies
 that are crisp as foil, and indeterminate clothing like a carapace. The
 rhythm of life is violent and abrupt. "Nature" is combat

<B></B>

and schism, not the fecund paradise of <I>Les Eus.</I> The dancer is
not the thinking body, the undissociated sensibility, but the orgiastic
wild body, hysterical and stupid. At the same time, the mechanical forms
turn "soft, quivering and quick flesh" into art, offering a vocabulary
for what Lewis called in <I>Blast</I> "any heroic, that is, energetic,
representations of men to-day" ("RC," 44).

Lewis remains one of the most vigorous, intelligent, and challenging
artists and writers of the twentieth century. He is also one of the
most problematic: homophobic, misogynist, and politically right-wing
(charges perhaps only Joyce escapes among the "men of 1914" [<I>BB,</I>
249]). Writing about Yeats, an "extreme right-wing, sporadically fascist
writer," Terry Eagleton argues that "valuable art comes into being
not <I>despite</I> its historical limitations . . . but <I>by virtue
of</I> them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF182" HREF="#FOOT182">182</a></SUP>
 This is not a matter of the straightforward thrust of a progressive
 ideology through the constraints of the hegemonic formation, but
 rather of "a certain curvature in the ideological space" (<I>CI,</I>
 180) resulting from that formation being produced "from a particular
 dissentient conflictual position within it" (<I>CI,</I> 181). The
 analogy holds, I think, if we make the triple translation from Yeats
 to Lewis, from poetry to art, and from class to sex. The Victorian
 "sex-gender system" was shifting ground from various pressures,

<B></B>

including feminism, before World War I. Eagleton suggests that Yeats's
critique of bourgeois values could only come from the radical Right,
but for that very reason could not avoid being "warped, corrupted and
disabled" (<I>CI,</I> 180) by the moulds in which it was cast. Lewis's
implicit critique of art and sex--of the role of the body as an expressive
instrument, of Bergsonian vitalism, of the Salon cocotte, or Camden Town
nudes, or feminine embodiments of Nature and <I>Rhythm</I>--<I>might have
been feminist,</I> but was, in the end, similarly compromised. Women
are sexually threatening or sexually vulnerable rather than sexually
emancipated as moderns. In fact it is astonishing how rarely and
equivocally any image of the modern woman appears in the traditional
iconography of modernity; look, for instance, at the sprightly
vernacular of this new one-step called <I>Shopping</I> in 1911 (<A
HREF="4.2tickner_9.html"> 9</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF183" HREF="#FOOT183">183</a></SUP>
 The feminine is not precisely equated by Lewis with those "technically
 on the distaff side" but remains a framing device for the heterosexual
 masculine imaginary. Homosexuality is obsessively repressed (though that
 is another story). But with hindsight we might argue that in Vorticist
 circles at least, "phallic aesthetics" comes into a new and vivid
 visibility, not as a purely contingent accompaniment to the influence
 of Futurism and the move to abstraction, but at a moment of crisis in
 the relations between masculinity and representation that made that move
 urgent. This, as well as the dance--indeed via the dance as a resource
 in the choreography of sexual relations--is what the work is "of."

The enemy that dogs him [Lewis] in all his works is an excessive
taste for life. He is inclined to modify his forms in the interest
of drama and psychology to the detriment of pure design. At times his
simplifications and rhythms seem to be determined by a literary rather
than a plastic conception. Probably this is not the kind of criticism
which by now Wyndham Lewis must have learnt to disregard. He is more
accustomed, I suspect, to hearing his work called "mechanical" and
"lifeless" . . . [<I>Nation,</I> 25 October 1913, 172-73].

The spectacular expansion of the British popular press in the late
nineteenth century was based on the exploitation of new technology
(cheap paper and faster printing), advertising revenues, a high adult
literacy rate due to the Education Act of 1870, and a well developed
railway and distribution network. The <I>Daily News,</I> <I>Daily
Sketch,</I> <I>Daily Mirror,</I> and <I>Daily Mail</I> all built up
tremendous circulations in the late Victorian and Edwardian period
(the <I>Daily Mail,</I> founded in 1896, was soon selling a million
copies a day), and enhanced their appeal with photographic reproductions
popularized by the <I>Daily Mirror</I> in 1904 and the <I>Daily Sketch</I>
in 1909. See Michael Twyman, <I>Printing, 1770-1970</I> (London:

other forms of reproduction in the illustrated press both in size and
quantity, and photographs of "society" assume a prominence at first
accorded only to the stage and popular entertainers.

Everyone by way of being fashionably interested in art, and many who had

ever. Pictures, I mean oil-paintings, were 'news.' Exhibitions were
reviewed in column after column. And no illustrated paper worth

notes a possible source for the term "apache" in Gustave Aimard's novels
of the 1860s and 1870s, which are set in America, and credits another
journalist, Victor Moris, with its dissemination in 1902. Moris may have
picked up on its use by the gangs themselves or by their neighbors,
who had all read Aimard; by whatever route, however, "l'Apache des
prairies est devenu l'Apache des faubourgs" (281 n. 10). M&eacute;ral
points out that James Fenimore Cooper's prairie novels were already
an influence on the French adventure novel, and that Eug&egrave;ne Sue
had openly acknowledged his debt to Cooper in transferring "the savage
customs of the Indians" to "a different group of [urban] barbarians"
(Jean M&eacute;ral, <I>Paris in American Literature</I> [Chapel Hill:

"I had not been considered beautiful enough to take part in the 'Jewel
Finale' in which the showgirls paraded as precious stones, ruby, diamond,
emerald, pearl," but Dearly taught her a new dance, saying, "'Never mind
the Jewels. I've found your stone for you--the paving stone. Mistinguett,
the 'pavement lily'" (Mistinguett, <I>Mistinguette:</I> [sic] <I>Queen of
the Paris Night,</I> trans. Lucienne Hill [London: Elek, 1954], 53). This
"brutal and tender" dance has "been imitated countless times, but always
on the basis of what Dearly and I, in our 'street corner apache' get-up,
created at the Moulin-Rouge" . Kees van Dongen painted Mistinguett and
Max Dearly in <I>La Valse Chaloup&eacute;e</I> (The apache dance), with
Mistinguett bending backwards with naked breasts, for "the requirements of
his canvas" . In 1919 Dearly and Mistinguett performed the apache
dance for the last time in <I>La Grande Revue,</I> a review of the
Moulin-Rouge in the days of La Goulue (106-7).

The apache was construed as specifically modern by both litterateurs
and politicians; see <I>CO,</I> 149, 204. For <I>Le Matin</I> in 1907
the type was unknown to a Balzac or a Sue, who could have drawn him
minutely, but was now widely prevalent in literature, so that one no
longer knew whether the apache had provoked a certain literature or
was the product of it; for Clemanceau, President of the Council in
1907, the apache was notable for his exploitation of the railways, the
telegraph, the telephone and all the <I>perfectionnements modernes</I>
(modern conveniences) for criminal ends. The captions four photographs
of the apache dance from <I>The Queen of the Moulin Rouge,</I> playing
in New York in 1909, spell out the narrative of sexual jealousy:

I am very grateful to Thomas Elsaesser of the University of Amsterdam
for pointing me in the direction of early Path&eacute; films, and to
Graham Melville of the National Film Archive in London for help in
locating what was subsequently identified as a seventy-second fragment
of <I>L'Empreinte.</I> Dearly and Mistinguett are mentioned in the cast
list, and Mistinguett wears the rather distinctive dress in which she
was photographed for the <I>Sketch</I> supplement, 21 October 1908,
8; this is probably her first appearance on film. See Henri Bousquet,
<I>Catalogue Path&eacute; des ann&eacute;es 1896 &agrave; 1914</I>
(Paris: Henri Bousquet, 1993), 138. Graham Melville has located for
me three apache films advertised or reviewed in the <I>Bioscope</I>
(the British trade paper) in 1912 and 1913. All of them turn on plots
involving fancy-dress apaches and resulting cases of mistaken identity:
<I>The Apache Ball</I> (30 May and 6 June 1912), <I>The Apache</I>
(15 and 18 August 1912), and <I>The Amateur Apache</I> (4 September 1913).

Casque d'Or was "inclined to consider two men ting on her account,
especially if knives were drawn, the finest homage" she could be rendered

tragic love in the apache fashion to "that foolish little thing made
with resignation by the grocer, haberdasher and baker of my quarter"

Ballets, 1884-1915" (Ph.D. diss. University of Surrey, 1993). I am
very grateful to Dr. Carter for advice on music-hall ballet. There is
an extensive and uneven literature on the music hall; see <I>Music Hall:

According to a contemporary Baedeker, London possessed "about 60
regular music-halls, besides ten times the number of smaller halls and
assembly-rooms" (<I>London and Its Environs</I> [Leipzig: Karl Baedeker,
1905], 67). In the larger halls the social mix was obviously rearranged
by the ticket prices; seats at the Empire cost 7s. 6d., 5s., 3s., 2s.,
1s., and 6d. . Six pence was the price of an illustrated paper like
the <I>Tatler</I> or <I>Vanity Fair.</I>

Large hats, long trains, ample busts, sequins and silk petticoats gave
the women of the Alhambra . . . and Empire promenades that five-pound
look which for thirty years had been accepted as the standard of a luxury
article. When hobbled skirts came in they might as well have frequented
the Leicester Lounge or one of the Caf&eacute;s nearby; full-rigged
whores were going the way of full-rigged ships: the promenade . . . was
not what it was. . . .

See also "London Hell: Sisters of Sin," <I>Modern Man,</I> 14 November

promenades (i. e., the Empire and the Alhambra) with their 5s. entrance
fees;  Piccadilly and Regent Street;  the Strand, Pimlico, or the
suburbs, leading to destitution and suicide in the Thames. Alexandra
Carter has found evidence to suggest that the Alhambra and Empire
promenades were also meeting places for homosexual men (Carter, "Winged

William Wees discusses the Cabaret Theatre Club in <I>Vorticism and the
English Avant-Garde</I> (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1972),
49-52, but the first substantial study of the club as an avant-garde
project is Richard Cork, "The Cave of the Golden Calf," <I>Artforum</I>
(December 1982): 56-68. This developed into the second chapter of
<I>Art Beyond the Gallery.</I> Any discussion of the Cabaret Theatre
Club is inevitably indebted to this pioneering account. I have drawn on
it selectively for my own ends, while adding some information of my own.

<P>
Mme. Frida Uhl Strindberg (1872-1943) was the playwright's divorced
second wife, and according to Nevinson, "the origin, or shall we say one
of the inspirations of Strindberg's tirades against women in general and
married women in particular" (<I>PP,</I> 41). Part of her motivation in
starting the club was apparently to perform Strindberg's plays in England,
although she had tried to start other supper- and nightclubs in London on
Percy Street and Hanover Square (<I>PP,</I> 41-42). Wees describes
her as given "to intense enthusiasms and histrionics" (<I>Vorticism
and the English Avant-Garde,</I> 49). She was in amorous pursuit of
both John and Lewis; in Lewis's case at least, the pursuit was probably
unsuccessful.

Many of the documents viewed by Cork in <I>ABG</I> were in the
possession of Frederick Gore; these and others are now dispersed. Where
I have quoted directly from the club's literature I have done so from
documents now at the Yale Center for British Art and the Theatre Museum
in London. The Yale Center archive includes the unpaginated "Preliminary
Prospectus" (April 1912), "Aims and Programme" (May 1912), "Programme"
(with designs by Lewis, and typed on the program for 17 June 1913),
"Intimate Theatre" announcement (to run for six months from 15 January
1913 "under temporarily the same Artistic Management as the Cabaret
Theatre Club"), and various printed envelopes with designs by Lewis. The
Theatre Museum collection includes "The Cave of the Golden Calf" brochure
incorporating the material in "Aims and Programme" of May 1912; a leaflet
dated September 1912 for the second season, beginning 15 October 1912;
an orange leaflet dated September 1913; "The Cave of the Golden Calf"
brochure dated September 1913 for the second season, opening 2 October,
referring specifically to "entirely new creations" by Lewis that were
added to the existing works by Harold Gilman, Charles Ginner, Eric Gill,
and Gore, and incorporating "Aims and Programme"; the "Sunday Theatre
Society" (and its autumn program, including Lewis's "Ombre Chinoises"
evening on 26 October); "Menu" (with designs by Lewis); "The Press and
the Cabaret Theatre Club" and a page, with designs by Lewis, on regular
dance arrangements: cotillion nights, tango teas, and champagne suppers,
and a loose page advertising Marinetti, 16 November [1913] on "L'Art
des Bruits," followed by a Futurist Supper. Lewis's 1912 <I>Cabaret

from the <I>Observer,</I> 21 June 1914, in the C. R. W. Nevinson
scrapbooks, vol. 2, press mark 7211.2, p. 40, Tate Gallery Archive:
Nevinson's <I>Syncopation</I> "may be described as a very much improved
version of Severini's 'Dance at the Caf&eacute; Monico,' which was
the feature of the first Futurist Exhibition in London." Joshua Taylor
discusses Severini's dance paintings, including <I>The Pan-Pan Dance
at the Monico</I>--"Severini's most discussed painting at the Paris

Munich, Vienna, Cracow, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Zurich</I> (New York:

"a laboratory, a testing ground for young artists who often deliberately
advertised themselves as an avant-garde, or as the satirical stage of
contemporaneity, a critically reflective mirror of topical events, morals,
politics and culture" ; perhaps in the best instances, it was both.

On Tuesday night the Cabaret Theatre Club's Cave in Heddon-street, where
the paulo-post-futurist paintings grin from the walls, and the club's
patronal beast (who, judging from appearances, must have been the pet of
some family for a good many years) gleams above the piano, was full of
people and smoke and void of any trace of British stiffness. . . . there
was plenty of that cheerful din which means that people are at their
ease, and the performers took their chance against the buzzing talk and
the whirring electric fans. [<I>Times</I> (London), 18 July 1912, 3]

refers to the Golden Calf window (<I>C,</I> 20-21). Morrow includes
engravings of the interiors of the Cabaret de l'Enfer and the Cabaret du
Ciel. The Cabaret du Ciel featured beer, angel musicians, a cort&egrave;ge
of Dante and his notables, St. Peter sprinkling holy water from a hole in
the sky, and at one end of the room a shrine "whereon an immense golden
pig sat sedately on his haunches, looking friendly and jovial, his loose
skin and fat jowls hanging in folds. Lighted candles sputted about his
golden sides. As the participants in the pageant . . . formed for the

at the Penguin," which opened at the Penguin Club, 8 East 15th St.,
New York, on 10 January 1917. The 1927 Quinn sale catalog describes
<I>Kermesse</I> (no. 382) as a "cubistic rendering of three festive
res, the central in rich yellow, the others in varying shades of red
and purple," and gives its dimensions as 8'9" high by 8'11" long. This
makes it slightly wider than its height, unlike the Yale <I>Kermesse,</I>
which is slightly higher than its width and has an additional strip of
paper pasted on to the original sheet, lengthening the design in ways
not evident in Brodzky's print. Quinn seems to have had second thoughts
about his purchase. In 1921 he wrote to Lewis, "I believe in you as a
thinker, as a writer and as an artist. But I don't think that you have
hit your pace in art yet. In the early days of the War I bought more
of your things than I should have bought then. The drawings I still
like, but those large, huge decorations, of an abstract kind are white
elephants in my hands" (Quinn to Lewis, 25 May 1921, Quinn Papers, New
York Public Library). According to annotations in the Tate Library copy
of the 1927 sale catalog, <I>Kermesse</I> was sold for only $15 and
<I>Plan of War</I> (no. 383) for $12.50. Gwen John's <I>Girl Reading at

For the moment, doubtless, many people will fail to allow themselves to
be influenced by this design, simply because they are not accustomed to
exert the passive attention to such a rhythmic disposition of abstract
units of form as this art demands. They are familiar enough with such an
attitude in music, but they are apt to turn crusty when it is demanded of
them by a painter. Fortunately, in the Albert Hall there is a method by
which any willing spectator may get a new <I>appercu</I> of such methods
of design. Let him look down into the arena from the gallery. . . .

A copy of the three-page contract is in the Wyndham Lewis Collection,
box 60, Cornell University. It required Mme. Strindberg to protect and
insure the painting and to pay &#163;10 in advance as the rental for
three months, from October to January [1912-13]; and for Lewis
to give her first offer on its purchase at the end of that period
for an additional &#163;20. The contract is quite clear that she has
expressed both "her desire to purchase his picture . . . for decorative
purposes in the CABARET THEATRE CLUB" and her inability "to pay the full
purchase sum of the picture viz. &#163;30" . This rather suggests that
<I>Kermesse,</I> which other evidence indicates was indeed commissioned
for, or at least intended as, a wall painting in the Cabaret Theatre
Club, was exhibited by Lewis in June when Mme. Strindberg failed to
find the money for it, and rented back to her in October as a way of
circumventing her financial difficulties, keeping it on display, and
enhancing its chances of purchase.

<I>Times</I> (London), 16 May 1914, 4. Mme. Strindberg embarked on the
RMS Campania for America, writing to John to ask "if ever you think
of me, do it without bitterness and stripe [<I>sic</I>] me of all the
ugliness that events have put on me and which is not in my heart"
(<I>ABG,</I> 113). In New York she offered a series of lectures,
"Creators: La Com&eacute;die Humaine," featuring Strindberg, Walter
Greaves, continental bohemia, John, the Vorticists, and <I>Blast.</I> The
publicity promised they would be unique "because of the curious blending
of her personality and her subject-matter." The publicity leaflet is
in the Wyndham Lewis Collecton, Cornell University. It outlines six
lectures under the exclusive management of the J. B. Pond Lyceum Bureau:
three on Strindberg; one on Walter Greaves, Whistler's pupil; one on
European artists and intellectuals including Paul Verlaine, Richard
Wagner, and Frank Wedekind; and one "From Aubrey Beardsley to Augustus
John" on Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, John, Henri Bergson, the Vorticists, and
<I>Blast.</I> To John, she wrote that "they want to see the animal and are
bidding a high price to hear it 'Lecture.'--As the animal is starving, it
sells itself that way. Life is prostitution all over I suppose . . . "

The cult of the dancer, with her speaking body and expressionless face,
was important to the symbolists as an emblem of the image of art. At
the same time a particular relationship existed for fin-de-si&egrave;cle
artists and sexologists between femininity, hysteria, and dance; for the
great women dancers of the period (like Loie Fuller or Isadora Duncan),
there was thus no necessary tension between their creativity and their
femininity, but at this cost: that, as Dijkstra puts it, "an entirely
new spectrum of creative expression . . . [was held to give] further
evidence of the hysterical eroticism and childlike nature of woman"
(Bram Dijkstra, <I>Idols of Perversity: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in
Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle Culture</I> [New York: Oxford University Press,
1986], 248). See Dijkstra for the relationship between Edward Carpenter,
Havelock Ellis, hysteria, and dance. See also Frank Kermode, <I>The

September 1913, advertising its reopening in October, advertised not
only tango teas each weekday from four until six-thirty and the "Tango
Champagne" each night from half past midnight, but also the engagement
of Professor Raoul d'Alvez, the "most prominent Continental exponent of
the Tango and the MAXIXE BRESILIENNE" (and teacher of the famous flamenco

Garafola points to Lewis's 1914 drawings of Nijinsky (hung in Countess

ventures to suggest "analogies between Nijinsky's rugged musculature,
displayed in revealing body stockings in <I>Spectre</I> and <I>Faune,</I>
and Lewis's dancing res of 1912, two of which the painter entitled
'Faunesque' and 'Seraglio'" (Lynn Garafola, <I>Diaghilev's Ballets
Russes</I> [New York: Oxford University Press, 1989], 328; hereafter

John Quinn to Augustus John, 3 February 1914, Quinn Papers, New York
Public Library. See also the photographs of "The Grizzly Bear," "The Bunny
Hug," "The Turkey Trot," and "The Tango" ("Terpsichorean Terrors Which are
Threatening to Undermine the Decorum of Our Ballrooms," <I>Tatler,</I>
27 March 1912, 355). The tango originated in the slums and bordellos of
Buenos Aires in the 1880s. Tourists had seen it danced in Montmartre or
Deauville, but the Gaiety revue <I>The Sunshine Girl,</I> which opened
in April 1912, was decisive in introducing it to a wider public as the
latest craze. It rapidly invaded the stage, the press, the ballroom,
the restaurant, and the private party, and its advance was unhindered by
letters of protest in the <I>Times</I> that denounced its lasciviousness
and feared for the safety of young girls at coming-out balls. Assisted by
occasional links to cubism in the press, tango enthusiasts and dancing
teachers stressed its modernity, and downplayed its eroticism, but it
seems likely that it was precisely this <I>danced</I> disruption of
the conventions of sexual decorum--this modernizing and primitivizing
move--that made the tango seem cognate with other forms of social
emancipation and avant-garde activity. Certainly the tango was a social
dance, companionate, and hence distinct from the apache dance (described
by tangoist Irene Castle as a form of exhibition dancing in which "the
male dancer tries to demolish the female dancer as spectacularly as
possible and usually succeeds" [Irene Castle, <I>Castles in the Air</I>
(Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday, 1958), 57]). But the acrobatic eroticism
was there in the dips, sways, entwined legs and backward bends.

<P>
Ragtime emerged out of black American music and dance forms around the
time of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, at the same time as new forms of
mass production, an increasing demand for sheet music, and new recording
and distribution techniques, ensured its widespread popularity. (Scott
Joplin's "Maple Leaf Rag" [1897, published 1899] sold more than a million
sheet-music copies in his lifetime.) Although ragtime bands appeared
in England earlier, ragtime's popularity was secured by <I>Hullo
Ragtime!,</I> which included such hits as "Hitchy-Koo" and "Waiting
for the Robert E. Lee" and secured the services of Irving Berlin for
its second edition. As with the tango, the origins, content, and force
of objections to ragtime--described by its detractors as hysterical,
negroid, and degenerate--probably added to its attractions in popular
entertainment. For its admirers (including Stravinsky), it was a genuinely
powerful and innovative resource for an original American music; for
its detractors (including Isadora Duncan), it represented a debased and
derivative aesthetic, an incitement to barbarism and hysteria. Francis
Toye takes this latter position, writing on "Ragtime: The New Tarantism"
in <I>The English Review</I> 13 (March 1913): 654-58; he has read
Jaques-Dalcroze on eurhythmics and concludes that the "false rhythms
and false movements" of ragtime are "allied with hysteria, neurosis and
nervous instability generally" .

<P>
Perhaps ragtime in the music hall or on the dance floor--modern dancing
to modern music under modern conditions--was the nearest thing to a
twentieth-century urban kermesse. Certainly ragtime was sometimes used
as a catchall for the modern spirit; as Ledward puts it in <I>Subsoil,</I>

regular beat of what is supposed to be, and catch on to the accent of
what you really feel. In fact, the difference between the old and the

By 1912 all three had performed in London. Flitch refers to Duncan
charming London audiences with her troupe of children "a year or so ago"

advertisements for tuition in all forms of dance. Duncan and Dalcroze also
had an influence on Diaghilev. Duncan had influenced Mikhail Fokine on a
visit to Russia in 1905 (Walter Sorell, <I>The Dance Through the Ages</I>
[London: Thames and Hudson, 1967], 165). Diaghilev and Nijinsky paid
the first of two visits to Dalcroze in Hellerau in 1912 in preparation
for <I>The Rite of Spring</I>  and <I>Jeux</I> , which its
composer, Claude Debussy, found too "Dalcrozian" (<I>DB,</I> 60-61).

on rhythmical movement springing from the solar plexus as what Duncan
called "the temporal home of the soul," and which was feminist in its
assertion of feminine autonomy and procreative power (she scandalized her
audience by dancing when she was pregnant) was the absolute antithesis
of the kaleidoscopic, precision movements of chorus-line spectacle as
it was developing in music-hall revue (Isadora Duncan, <I>My Life</I>
[Garden City, N. Y.: Garden City Publishing, 1927], 341). Lewis may have

<I>Blast</I> announced its "violent boredom with that feeble Europeanism,
abasement of the miserable 'intellectual' before anything coming
from Paris, Cosmopolitan sentimentality, which prevails in so many
quarters" (Wyndham Lewis, "Manifesto--2," <I>Blast</I> 1, 34). Lewis
was later quite explicit about his distaste for the homosexual and
feminine fashionability of the Russian Ballet, first in <I>The Caliph's
Design</I>  but more specifically in <I>Time and Western Man</I>
, although there it is the postwar Russian Ballet that he calls
"a bastard 'revolutionary' article," the most perfect expression of "the
'revolutionary' High-Bohemia of the Ritzes and Rivieras," a restaging
of "the Nineties of Oscar Wilde and Beardsley" (Wyndham Lewis, <I>Time
and Western Man</I> [1927], ed. Paul Edwards [Santa Rosa: Black Sparrow
Press, 1993], 32, 33). The social and sexual connotations of Bloomsbury's
affection for Diaghilev's dancers would not have helped: see Peter Jacobs,
"'Quel D&eacute;cor!': Nijinsky Conquers Bloomsbury," <I>Charleston
Magazine</I> 9 (spring-summer 1994): 15-19. It is nevertheless
the case (and perhaps a mark of Lewis's perversity) that in 1919 he
divulged to John Quinn the "very great secret" that he was doing a set of
designs for a ballet "which I hope Diaghilev will take." It was apparently
a scheme of the Sitwell's, for which the young William Walton would write
the music. This was to be followed by "a Sea Ballet, scene at Deptford"
(Lewis to Quinn, 3 September 1919, Quinn Papers, New York Public Library).

ballet "became a magnet for homosexuals" (<I>DB,</I> xii).

published "The New Sculpture" on 16 February 1914, 67-68; Richard
Aldington (as "Auceps") responded, ridiculing it, on 2 March 1914,

117-18. (That month Pound was sitting for Gaudier-Brzeska for what
became known as <I>The Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound.</I>) Gaudier-Brzeska's

Michael T. H. Sadler, "The Value of Eurhythmics to Art," 63. Hellerau was
the Dresden suburb where Dalcroze's Institut opened in 1911. Lewis's
1912 apaches, debauching peasants, or exterminating insects all
represent, in their various ways, the antitheses of such "new and
harmonious" ideals. In the Bergsonian scheme of things insects were the
most advanced representatives of instinct, at the opposite evolutionary
pole from human intelligence. This suggests that Lewis's antivitalism
did not prevent him from using a Bergsonian metaphor to cast his dancers
as mechanical, instinctual, and socially patterned (rather than humanly
expressive). This in turn sits well with his description of Futurism as
"flavoured strongly with H. G. Wells's dreams of the dance of monstrous
and arrogant Machinery, to the frenzied clapping of men's hands" (Wyndham
Lewis, "The Cubist Room," <I>Egoist,</I> 1 January 1914, 8-9);
with negative commentaries on dances like the tango; and indeed with
the <I>Yorkshire Observer</I>'s disapproval of Lewis's <I>Danse</I> at

The Countess of Drogheda who has had her dining room decorated in a

carried her devotion to art in the newest form to such a practical end

See "FT," passim. Rainey's argument is principally concerned with the
impact of Futurism on the exploration of new social and commercial
spaces (and hence audiences) for avant-garde activity. "Il Teatro di
variet&agrave;" is translated as "The Variety Theater" in <I>Marinetti:
Selected Writings,</I> ed. R. W. Flint, trans. Flint and Arthur
A. Coppotelli (London: Secker and Warburg, 1972) 116-22; this
volume is hereafter abbreviated <I>SW.</I> "Il Teatro di variet&agrave;"
was originally published in <I>Lacerba</I> 1, 1 October 1913, and
in the <I>Daily Mail,</I> 20 November 1913. It was discussed in
the <I>Sketch,</I> 14 January 1914, 38. Marinetti also published a
"Manifesto of the Futurist Dance" (8 July 1917) and "Down with the Tango
and Parisfal" (a "Futurist letter circulated among cosmopolitan women
friends who give tango-teas and Parsifalize themselves, January 11,
1914" [<I>SW,</I> 69]), both reprinted in <I>SW,</I> 137-41,
69-71. The former manifesto praises Nijinsky, Duncan (if
ambivalently, as finally "childishly feminine" [<I>SW,</I> 137]), and
Dalcroze's rhythmic gymnastics ("which nevertheless limits its effects
to muscular hygiene and the description of the work of the fields"
[<I>SW,</I> 138]), at the expense of the explicitly Futurist dances of
Valentine de Saint-Point: "We Futurists prefer Louie [<I>sic</I>] Fuller
and the 'Cakewalk' of the Negroes (utilization of electric light and
mechanisms)" (<I>SW,</I> 138). Valentine de Saint-Point--the pseudonym
of Mme. Desglans de Cessiat-Vercell, author of the "Manifesto of the
Futurist Woman" --invented what she termed Futurist "metachoreia,"
accentuating the hard lines of limbs and muscles by veiling the
nonmuscular parts of the body, including the face. Photographs taken
at the Poirier Theatre, Paris, are reproduced in the <I>Sketch</I>
supplement, 7 January 1914, 5. Marinetti deemed this "pass&eacute;ist
poetry that navigates within the old Greek and medieval sensibility:
abstractions danced but static, arid, cold, emotionless" (<I>SW,</I>
138) and argued for Futurist dances derived "from the three mechanisms
of war" (<I>SW,</I> 139): the "Dance of the Shrapnel" (<I>SW,</I> 138),
the "Dance of the Machine Gun" (<I>SW,</I> 140) and the "Dance of the
Aviatrix" (<I>SW,</I> 141). When Marinetti writes that "One must go beyond
muscular possibilities and aim in the dance for that ideal <I>multiplied
body</I> of the motor that we have so long dreamed of. One must imitate
the movements of machines with gestures; pay assiduous court to steering
wheels, ordinary wheels, pistons, thereby preparing the fusion of man
with the machine, to achieve the metallicity of the Futurist dance"
(<I>SW,</I> 138), he invokes something like the steely surfaces and
multiple planes of Lewis's Yale <I>Kermesse.</I>

"a piece of news": "The excellent Mrs. Turner is going to take a large
studio or hall near Park Lane and there house my squadron of paintings,
until after the war a large building is constructed for them in the
rear of her own house. She will pay the rent, furnish it, and I suppose
supply a page boy or secretary: also a stage for Theatrical Performances,
Lectures etc." (<I>L,</I> 67). In the summer of 1915 Lewis wrote to Turner
admonishing her for her response to his request for "the settlement of
an obligation" (<I>L,</I> 73). (He also asks if a painting en route to
her solicitors after the Dor&eacute; show can be forwarded to Quinn in
America, and if she can help him get a "place of advantage" [<I>L,</I>
74], as he must enlist.)

In the summer of 1908 Lewis was ill with venereal disease in Spain
and his German mistress, in a torturous but binding relationship, was
pregnant in Brittany with an unwanted child. Lafourcade does not mention
"Ida" when he views the summer in Brittany as critical for Lewis,
suggesting that he needed both to tear himself away, and to tame and
contain the intractability of Breton life in his fiction, and that he
resorted to certain devices--to Dickensian surreality or sociological
generalizations--to do so; see Bernard Lafourcade, "Afterword," in Lewis,
<I>The Complete Wild Body,</I> ed. Lafourcade, 403-14. I would argue
that in a parallel move, the influence of Futurism--marked after the
Sackville Gallery exhibition of March 1912--gave Lewis the tensed, dynamic
geometry that translated his early vitalism into formalism and delivered
the wild body to the laughing observer. It is himself he is remaking.

Mr. Muckerji does not know that his dutiful interviewing of neighbors
after the death of young Else Crole is putting his own life in peril: the
manageress Mrs. Mendrill is the killer, and in the passage above she is
angling to discover how much Mr. Muckerji has learned about her crime. Nor
does the dogged toiler for science realize that his conversation with her
has an unseen auditor in D., the confidential agent of Greene's title, who
is in Britain on a desperate secret mission for his war-torn continental
nation and is himself at constant risk of exposure and assassination
by the manageress and others. But then, Greene's joke centers on how
completely oblivious this diligent volunteer analyst of British society
can be to what is really going on all around him, how incapable he shows
himself of 
<b></b>
grasping the machinations and motive forces that control
his social world. Nor does the joke stop there. The notion of a (supposed)
suicide's being "of sociological importance" seems an ironic nod in the
direction of Durkheim, whose study of the phenomenon helped inaugurate,
and set the standard for, modern social thought. And Greene toys with some
ideas fundamental to Mass-Observation, that amateur research organization
of the late 1930s to which Mr. Muckerji has pledged himself. Prominent
among these is the idea of an "anthropology of ourselves" and the degree
of "distance" or alienation from a culture necessary for the scientific
understanding of it. To Mass-Observation's self-distancing proclamation
that "we are studying the beliefs and behavior of the British Islanders"
(as opposed, say, to the Trobriand Islanders of Malinowski's classic
fieldwork), Greene answers back by making his fictional mass observer "an
Indian gentleman" resident in England, to whom we are invited to ascribe
an unbridgeable detachment from, not to say a blank incomprehension of,
English culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 He also gives us the eavesdropping visitor
D., placed at a still greater remove from all things English by his
foreignness, on which the novel's other characters comment incessantly,
and by his war-transformed consciousness. The literally shell-shocked
D. makes his way through the English landscape struck dumb by the kinds
of pursuits and consciousness peace makes possible, among which must be
counted those of Mass-Observation. His puzzlement about Mr. Muckerji's
activities ("What was that? . . . He could make no sense of it") is part
of his larger bafflement in the face of all those many details of social
life, large and small, that a culture's "insiders" take for granted but
that may hold the clue to its operations and identity. As Malinowski
declared in <I>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</I> , "foolish
indeed and short-sighted would be the man of science who would pass by a
whole class of phenomena, ready to be garnered, and leave them to waste,
even though he did not see at the moment to what theoretical use they
might be put!" It was, after all, in the myriad <I>imponderabilia</I> of
native life that "the innumerable threads which keep together the family,
the clan, the village community, the tribe" were spun.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 M-O,
as it came to be known, followed suit by arguing that its investigation
of Britons' smoking habits "demonstrate[d] how relevant to the structure
of society the study of small details of behaviour can be" (<I>FYW,</I>
23), and later by insisting, in an analysis of the 1938 dance craze
the Lambeth Walk, that "[i]f you are prepared to be scientific about
society, you must . . . forget your pre-conceived ideas" (<I>BM-O,</I>
140) about what will be important and what will prove fleeting or trivial.
<P>
This essay is about Mass-Observation's ways of understanding and
presenting itself, and about the influences and limitations on
its attempt at a populist auto-ethnography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 I will give
particular attention to the movement's most substantial early product, the
book-length study of British life on a single day, May 12th, 1937--George
VI's Coronation Day, which followed upon and, it was hoped, put an end
to the great national crisis of Edward VIII's abdication. The title of
the volume devoted to it is <I>May the Twelfth;</I> to avoid confusion
I will refer to the book by that name and to the day by 12 May. But
before turning to the circumstances of that book's production or the
characteristics of its form, I will be concerned with the circumstances
<b></b>
surrounding Mass-Observation's founding and the implications
arising from the way both its creators and its detractors characterized
it. Mass-Observation and <I>May the Twelfth</I> hold a particular
fascination for they occupy a force-field of many crossed and conflicting
energies associated with contemporaneous and more traditional ideas:
about temporal and spatial forms of representation, about science and art,
individual and society, official and popular, politics and anthropology,
modernism and Victorianism, nationalism and anti-nationalism.

In a manner precisely opposite to M-O's habitual practice, Graham Greene's
confidential agent finds his defining anti-self in a mass-observer. By
placing his spy momentarily in the position of an ethnographer
overhearing a busybody with scientific pretensions, Greene turns the
tables on Mass-Observation and its volunteers, "anthropologists of
themselves" who were often compared by a condescending mainstream press
to busybodies and spies (<A HREF="4.3buzard_1.html"> 1</A>). In pursuit of nothing less than the
<b></b>
democratization of social knowledge, M-O placed itself alongside a
host of spurious doubles, images of false community and false claims to
know community, implicitly defining itself as the self-knowing culture
of Britain. Preeminent among its anti-selves was that sneering official
journalism, which, M-O said, "made some show of asking the 'Man in
the Street' what he is thinking" but which was really more concerned
to mythologize the national community on behalf of the State, speaking
blithely of how, for instance, "[t]he British nation unreservedly places
its complete trust in the Prime Minister, Mr. Neville Chamberlain," during
the Munich crisis (<I>BM-O,</I> 36). Political and market research were
other prime targets: the pamphlet "A Thousand Mass-Observers" pointed
out that "Mass-Observation has been approached by politicians, and by
advertising agencies, which have suggested financing its researches for
their own benefits," but that so far such interested parties had been
held at bay.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Academic social science was intermittently
cast in the role of M-O's <I>b&ecirc;te noire,</I> except when its
imprimatur could be of assistance. The organizers made sport of the
public's greater trust in astrology than in the British Association for
the Advancement of Science (which they sophomorically abbreviated "British
Ass"), but they nonetheless sought the benediction of Malinowski--"best
known living anthropologist"
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
--and got it, qualifiedly, in
a fascinating document appended to their report <I>First Year's Work,
1937-38</I> (<I>BM- O,</I> chap. 1; <I>FYW,</I> 81-121). What
their studies often focused on, not just as objects of analysis but as
<I>competitors,</I> were the rituals or institutions that appeared to
cut across class boundaries and to actualize the larger collectivity
of all Britain. "From the enormous horoscopic data of the 1938 Press,"
M-O noted, "it is possible to construct a whole ethic of contemporary
England" (<I>BM-O,</I> 20). The Lambeth Walk could be found "in Mayfair
ball-rooms, suburban dance-halls, cockney parties and village hops"
from the southern counties up to Scotland (<I>BM-O,</I> 139). Then
there was the "new social grouping" represented by weekly football
pools such as Littlewood's, which marketed itself as a nonexclusive and
ever-expanding "Happy Circle," a "large, friendly, luck-giving group"
(<I>FYW,</I> 32, 42). Littlewood's promotional literature invoked as its
champions such national luminaries as "Lord Strabolgi, Nervo and Knox,
and King John signing Magna Charta," and it even featured a fictional
character who might have struck the M-O planners as the despicable
<I>doppelg&auml;nger</I> of their own potentially ubiquitous British
ethnographic consciousness: a re called the "Little Ol' Man o' the
Wood" who, subscribers were promised, "goes everywhere, sees everything,
and gives you the football facts you cannot obtain elsewhere" (<I>FYW,</I>
40). The Czech crisis itself and the press's handling of it must be
added to these other versions of anti-culture and anti-knowledge that
occupy so much of M-O's attention. The grim parody of national oneness
in culture took place, we are reminded, when the distribution of "[g]as
masks brought the war danger home to everybody and to every home. It
was democracy inverted--everyone had the vote, now everyone had a mask"
(<I>BM-O,</I> 88).

Aiming to close "the gap between official views and mass facts"
(<I>BM-O,</I> 196), Mass-Observation strove to make knowledge of "who we
are" no longer the preserve of "the scientific specialists, most of whose
lives are spent in laboratories and lecture 
<b></b>
rooms" and to "giv[e]
working-class and middle-class people a chance to speak for themselves,
about themselves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 "They Speak for Themselves" is the title
of more than one of the self-promotional efforts in which the movement's
founders--Charles Madge, Tom Harrisson, and Humphrey Jennings--touted
a variety of schemes designed to solicit accounts both of and by the
"unheard" British people in their everyday life (<A HREF="4.3buzard_2.html"> 2</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Like
the oppositional cultural critics of more recent years, the Mass-Observers
employed a rhetoric of Letting the Hitherto Silenced Speak, implying
that the hitherto silenced <I>had</I> a story to tell, an alternative
history or separate narrative "of their own."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 "They Speak
for Themselves: Mass-Observation and Social Narrative" is the full title
of the article I have just mentioned; and the illustrative subtitle of a
contemporaneous pamphlet was "Mass-Observation Wants Your Story." David
Pocock, Director of the Tom Harrisson Mass-Observation Archive at the
University of Sussex, describes <I>May the Twelfth</I> as a subversive
counter-history "to be borne in mind whenever [one is faced] with an
'official record'" of the Coronation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 But that is to grasp
only some of the energies informing Mass-Observation. In a manner that
foreshadows our own cultural criticism, the Mass-Observers' rhetoric of
Letting the Silenced Speak was divided in itself about whether it was to
yield "<I>another</I> story," complete unto itself, or "the other side of
<I>the</I> story"--in other words, about whether it was to produce
<b></b>
a narrative of popular culture that presented that narrative and that
culture as fundamentally independent of official versions, or whether
it was to supplement the official account and therefore to complete one
grand narrative of the British national culture.
<P>
Furthermore, M-O's difficulty in deciding whether it was free of,
opposed to, or in complicity with state power to represent the people
was increased by the fact that its appeal to the idea of Speaking for
Ourselves collided with, or intertwined with, or was cross-hatched
by, other sorts of appeals that seemed at odds with narrative models
of identity and representation. These derived chiefly from the new
social science of functionalist ("cultural") anthropology and from
modernism's experiments with what Joseph Frank was to name "spatial
form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 The rhetoric of Our Own Story coexisted, in other
words, with generic impulses disruptive or suspicious of story form,
impulses under whose aegis M-O sometimes construed "the popular"
as a recalcitrant anti-narrative force--or inertia. And even these
impulses carried conflicts of their own into the M-O mix. Were models
to be taken from the emergent ethnography and modernism of the 1910s, or
from their consolidating versions of the 1930s and after? In aesthetics,
Mass-Observation was pulled in two directions: on the one hand, there was
the early, rebellious avant-gardism of Wyndham Lewis's <I>Blast</I> or of
"the Image" conceived as "anti-traditional, individualist, intuitive,
expressive"; on the other, the enshrined modernism that was M-O's
contemporary, nowhere more plainly embodied than in the "classicist,
royalist, Anglo-Catholic" Eliot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Now well on its way into
the establishment, and minus the gadfly Pound, thirties and forties
modernism in Britain had largely made its peace with nationalism,
embraced its Britishness. Auden's poetry of the early thirties often
made a specifically national address, as in the pseudo-anthropological
<I>Orators,</I> in "Look, stranger, at this island now" or in "O Love,
the interest itself in thoughtless heaven"; the Auden who left England
in the later 1930s can also be seen as a poet departing from modernism,
eager to revisit and revitalize traditional poetic forms. With an apparent
pre-1933 innocence, Stephen Spender even labeled the aesthetic of poems
like "O Love . . ." a "national socialist" one, an appellation Auden did
not repudiate (though this was before the Nazis' monopoly on its usage
became impossible to deny).
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Eliot's cosmopolitan poetics of
"Jerusalem Athens Alexandria / Vienna London" were to become the poetics
of "Little Gidding," of "Now and in England."

Likewise, anthropology had passed through its militant self-advertising
stage and taken its place among the accredited disciplines; it too
had gone from stressing its boundary-defying aspects to stressing its
boundary-securing ones. Malinowski had canvassed for his new fieldworking
science by highlighting the scandalous fluidity of personality necessary
for participating in it: the expatriate anthropologist had even joked
that it was perhaps his flexible "Slavonic nature" that rendered him more
adroit at self-transformation than the more rigidly socialized English
(<I>A,</I> 21). His new intellectual enterprise had distinguished itself
with its audacious claim to deliver social knowledge by blurring the
boundaries dividing investigator from object: the participant observer
must <I>become</I> that object, however temporarily. This capacity
to 
<b></b>
set aside one's acculturated self and occupy the position of
another had gone hand-in-hand with a thoroughgoing relativism, since one
could never properly judge a phenomenon of some culture from a position
outside it. And this had placed fieldworkers under the injunction to
attend to "everything," since nothing could be judged according to
standards held before undergoing the rite of passage in the field. As
Hortense Powdermaker, one of Malinowski's first graduate students,
recalled, the master had "told us to note down everything we saw and
heard, since in the beginning it is not possible to know what may or
may not be significant."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
<P>
The Malinowski who granted Mass-Observation his partial assent in 1938
was quite a different re, not at all inclined to style his science
a nomadic one or himself an alien in Britain. He did not flinch at
the evocations of spying in the title of his essay on the movement, "A
Nation-Wide Intelligence Service"; indeed, he contrasted M-O with the
"national spy and police systems" of fascist and communist governments
(<I>FYW,</I> 121). Anthropology <I>should</I> be of "real service to the
nation," he now insisted despite some self-contradiction, and he judged
the new movement according to that criterion (<I>FYW,</I> 83). This
was not the brash &eacute;migr&eacute; of <I>Argonauts of the Western
Pacific,</I> but the author of <I>Foundations of Faith and Morals,</I>
now intent on demarcating the "legitimate faith" attached to organic
traditions like the British monarchy from the "newly manufactured pseudo
mysticisms" of Berlin, Rome, and Moscow (<I>FYW,</I> 104-5). Even
while endorsing the "Home-Coming of Anthropology" as the "inevitable
consequence" of his researches elsewhere, even while maintaining
that "[f]rom the start of my own fieldwork, it has been my deepest
and strongest conviction that we must finish by studying ourselves
through the same methods and with the same mental attitude with which we
approach exotic tribes" (<I>FYW,</I> 103), this Malinowski reaffirmed in
no uncertain terms that division between observer and observed which his
own earlier work questioned and which an Anthropology of Ourselves would
seem bound at least to qualify. The volunteer observers were once and for
all "informants," not authorized practitioners: "[t]heir statements [were]
the subject matter on which further scientific analysis is indispensable"
(<I>FYW,</I> 96; cf. 118). Bemoaning "the confusion between observer
and observed" as "the fundamental confusion that still dominates social
science," Malinowski now declared that "the distinction between . . . the
scientific approach to uncontrollable human acts and the subjective states
experienced during such acts . . . must be maintained throughout the whole
course of observation" (<I>FYW,</I> 100, 97). At issue here was nothing
so dramatic as a betrayal of previously held principles, but rather a
shift in emphasis, motivated by historical and professional factors,
from certain elements in the discipline's initial self-definition to
other elements hitherto left more or less implicit. The pressures of
totalitarianism abroad and amateurism at home encouraged the British
ethnographic authority to align his functionalism with the totalizing
aims of the nation-state and to criticize upstarts for their unmethodical
fact- and trivia-mongering. M-O's as yet unrealized potential lay for him
in its capacity to reveal "[t]he way in which . . . infinitely small,
infinitely many details of social reality work, act and integrate into
big collective movements, the manner in which they are related 
<b></b>
to
legislation, politics, declarations of policy and acts of State." This was
"the main task of social science" (<I>FYW,</I> 89). Toward the performance
of it, M-O would have to break its addiction to "the inchoate observing
of everything" (<I>FYW,</I> 85).

Understanding Mass-Observation's constitutive ambivalences helps
explain why accounts of the movement, even by its own inventors, were
so Janus-faced. Prevailing anthropological functionalism mandated that a
study of "the beliefs and behavior of the British Islanders" would be an
intentionally anti-political undertaking, directed not at producing change
or servicing interest groups but at "capturing" or "salvaging" the culture
of a whole people, setting it free of time and change.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 And
yet the Anthropologists of Ourselves sometimes championed their creation
as "a political challenge of the man in the street, . . . a populist
demand that democracy should mean what it says, rule by the people,
appraised [sic] of the facts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Gayatri Spivak's delineation
of two often conflated senses of "representation"--as <I>Vertretung</I>
(political) or <I>Darstellung</I> (mimetic)--seems pertinent here:
a tendency to run together what I am calling the auto-ethnographic
gesture of Speaking <I>of </I>Ourselves and the political gesture of
Speaking <I>for</I> Ourselves was present from the start, with the
result that M-O's self-characterizations could convey alternately
<b></b>
revolutionary and totalitarian overtones.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 With its
multiplicity of viewpoints and its destabilization of the relationship
between possessor of the gaze and its object, the liberating idea of
fostering "the observation of everyone by everyone, including themselves"
could suggest a nightmare of total surveillance, the completion of that
process Foucault explored, by which the disciplining gaze is dispersed
throughout the modern social order.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The social-scientific
and press establishments were clearly motivated to present M-O in an
unflattering light, and this they did by making it appear ridiculous
or sinister by turns; but what is more striking is that the founders
themselves, and especially that genius of self-promotion, Tom Harrisson,
often took to the pages of mainstream newspapers and magazines in
order to publicize their movement in the very terms in which it was
being derided or castigated ( <A HREF="4.3buzard_3.html">3</A>, 
<A HREF="4.3buzard_4.html">4</A>). Harrisson was canny enough
to exploit the <I>frisson</I> of the thought that everybody might be
spying on everybody, a notion that could be doubly flattering, since
it implied that everybody was capable of observing and sufficiently
important to be <I>worth</I> observing. Even in soliciting amateur
observers' contributions for the day survey of 12 May 1937, M-O couched
its invitation in the intermittently alarming and titillating refrain of
"Watch yourself. And watch your neighbour."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Perhaps it is
not 
<b></b>
very surprising to learn that only a few years later, at the
beginning of the war, Mass-Observation was to embark upon a new career in
the service of the State, subcontracting with the Ministry of Information
to produce studies of public morale.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Jennings having dropped
out of the movement in 1938, Madge and Harrisson argued bitterly over
this move, with Madge warning of the "grave danger of [M-O's] becoming
propagandist" (quoted in <I>M-O:SH,</I> 39) and ultimately relinquishing
the reconstituted movement entirely to Harrisson's control by mid-1940.
<P>
My subject is the "moment" of Mass-Observation, from its founding
through the production of <I>May the Twelfth.</I> Viewed properly, it
will appear a protracted moment indeed, the understanding of which will
require that we oscillate between the late-1930s climate and traditions
of social and philosophical discourse reaching back by sometimes tortuous
paths to Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment Europe. It will also
entail paying a greater respect to Madge's and Jennings' short-lived
contributions than they tend to receive. Madge handled the loose-knit
network of volunteer observers that served as backbone for <I>May the
Twelfth,</I> and Jennings is usually credited with giving the book
what has been called its collage-like structure by cutting and pasting
together press clippings and observers' reports. Tom Harrisson, who
bore the closest approximation of anthropological credentials among the
three, had no part in the book and did not consider it to be anthropology
at all, "if by anthropology we mean not only the description but also
the integration and explanation of a whole phenomenon in its cultural
context; it was rather a detailed piece of documentation, having much in
common with the documentary film."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Yet Harrisson's adherence
to functionalist criteria may have been inappropriate to <I>this</I>
cultural context, since M-O was definitively unable to decide whether
the British culture it went in search of was something amenable to--even
longing for--totalization, or something anathema to it.

The immediate stimulus for the founding of Mass-Observation was provided
by a letter in the December 1936 issue of the <I>New Statesman</I> that
took the recent abdication crisis as evidence of the "desperate need" for
an "anthropological study of our own situation" (quoted in <I>M-O:SH,</I>
2). Poet and journalist Charles Madge responded with a letter proclaiming
the existence of a group designed to perform just that service; by chance
Madge's letter appeared alongside a poem written by Tom Harrisson based
on his recent experiences living among "cannibals" in Malekula in the New
Hebrides. Once happenstance had brought them together, however, Madge
and Harrisson soon defined their efforts in precisely complementary
terms. The editors of <I>May the Twelfth</I> tell us that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[t]he main development of Mass-Observation has been two-fold, firstly
the network of Observers all over the country; secondly an intensive
survey of a single town. Charles Madge runs the former, Tom Harrisson
the latter. . . . The local survey starts with whole-time 
<b></b>
 research
workers studying a place from the outside and working inwards, getting
into the society, and so coming to the individual. The national plan
starts from the individual Observers and works outwards from them into
their social surroundings. [<I>MT,</I> iv-v]

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Madge's "network of Observers," later to be known as the National
Panel, began with 420 respondents to the call published in the
<I>New Statesman</I> in 1937, and never grew much beyond this
number.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Working out of his home in Blackheath, Madge
dispatched regular "directives" to these volunteers, suggesting
topics to receive special attention in the reports they were to
write once a month on their everyday lives and environments. Topics
ranged from large and public to small and private, from somber to
(perhaps unintentionally) absurd: from opinions on the impending war
to observations of mantelpieces; from feelings about social class
to feelings about armpits; from anti-Semitism to "the Aspidistra
cult." Harrisson, on the other hand, set up his base of operations in
Bolton (called "Worktown" in M-O publications) and took as his objective
the study of that town's working-class culture from a standpoint
of what ethnographers had only recently begun to call Participant
Observation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 It is easy to spot the methodological faults
that litter this presumptive social science, among them the polarizing of
society and individual, the positivist fetishizing of "social facts," the
lack of representative samples. I do not mean to overlook these and other
valid criticisms that have been made of the aims, methods, and products
of Mass-Observation and more particularly of <I>May the Twelfth,</I>
but rather, having acknowledged them, to take the discussion in other
directions. Specifically, I would like to consider the complementary
metaphors of spatial relationship and of movement through space that are
used to describe M-O's methodologies--"working inwards" and "working
outwards." These function rhetorically to vouch for the relationship
between the two projects themselves, as if a project moving in one
direction and its partner moving in the other will effectively "cover
the field" or give a total account of society between them. The metaphors
also evoke the two different conceptions of anthropology that circulate
throughout the records of Mass-Observation and had not entirely sorted
themselves out in the anthropological theory of the period.
<P>
Harrisson's Worktown studies were informed mainly, though not without
much inner contradiction, by early twentieth-century practices in
ethnography and by that new science's rhetoric for defining its object
and accrediting its practitioners. This emergent and much-publicized form
of anthropology departed from its nineteenth-century ("ethnological")
forerunner in defining its object not as the singular "culture" of
humankind but as "<I>a</I> culture"--that is, a distinct, bounded network
of human relationships and meanings, one of an unspecified number of
cultures across the globe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 At the same time, it red
its practitioner as a participant observer whose first task was to get
"inside" the culture, to look at it "from inside."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 In just
such terms did Harrisson, a product of Harrow and a Cambridge drop-out,
understand his and his colleagues' labors in working-class Bolton. "We
sought," he later recalled, "to fully penetrate the society we were
studying, to live in it as effective members of it and to 
<b></b>
percolate
into every corner of every day and every night of industrial life" (quoted
in <I>M-O:SH,</I> 26). In this discourse, a powerful if usually unstated
connection between cultures and specific, mappable territories of the
globe made the physical acts of entry or boundary-crossing into leading
tropes for the moral and mental reinvention of the self that would be
necessary to achieve the ethnographer's desiderata, "rapport" and the
insider's view. Just as important, of course--though more likely to be
left implicit in ethnography's early radical phase--was the injunction
that the fieldworking ethnographer get back "outside" again, or (to put
it another, related way) that enough of him <I>remain</I> outside, even
while some of him passed "in," to permit him to retain his bearings
as a scientist and be capable of producing ethnographic knowledge. In
<I>Argonauts,</I> Malinowski insisted that the ethnographer attain
the perspective of a member of the culture he studied, the goal being
"to grasp the native's point of view, his relation to life, to realise
<I>his</I> vision of <I>his</I> world"; but every professional exigency
demanded that the perspective actually amount to one of (in Bernard
McGrane's phrases) "simulated membership" or "membership without
commitment to membership."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 A practitioner's authority
hinged upon the demonstration of what we might call an <I>outsider's
insideness,</I> an achieved passage into alien lifeways that nevertheless
held any permanent "going native" to be an abdication of authority and
identity alike.
<P>
The two related ways I have mentioned above for describing the
ethnographer's condition divide between them the modern aesthetics
of representing cultures, much as the arts of time and space divide
the field of aesthetics in Lessing's <I>Laoco&ouml;n</I> and in
the theoretical legacy that descends from it. One account implies a
narrative sequence in which the successful ethnographer proceeds into
the alien culture and then out again; the other invokes a single image
of the ethnographer's simultaneous appearance on either side of the
subject/object divide, a splitting of the self that increases rather
than diminishes its authority.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Of course, it is far from
clear how "cultures" can be said to be represented (in the sense of
<I>Darstellung</I>) at all, if they are conceived not as observable
phenomena (neither objects lending themselves to spatial depiction nor
events lending themselves to temporal rendering), but as the invisible
networks connecting social facts and giving those facts all the meaning
and value they are entitled to.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Practicing a "mimesis as
make-believe," however, ethnography and its precursor genres habitually
pretend to be representing cultures, by such means as the kinship diagram,
the account of some purportedly totalizing ritual, the description of
"typical" scenes, the recounting of "illustrative" native myths, songs, or
stories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 At any rate, every story told or picture painted
of a culture implied a corresponding autobiography or self-portrait
of the storyteller or painter. The ethnographic enterprise entailed
the dialectical definition of an essentially mobile or unplaceable
ethnographer, on the one hand, and an essentially immobile culture on
the other--bounded in space, its inhabitants <I>mentally</I> immobilized
or even "incarcerated" by their own adherence to custom.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
The culture was paid the compliment of being seen as a social totality
<I>so</I> total, so densely integrated, that every member, object, and
event, no matter how utilitarian or banal, had its place and was suffused
<b></b>
with meaning and value;
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 but this could be so only if the
culture stayed within its semiotic and territorial boundaries, neither
contaminated by nor seeking to play a part in the anomic modernity
from which the ethnographer had come. Ethnographic cultures were to
some degree the utopian preserves of disaffected moderns, which helps
explain why they were almost always characterized as already tainted by
outside influences and in need of salvaging by ethnography. (Malinowski
speaks repeatedly of a time "in olden days" when Trobriand culture was
presumably in a condition purer than that in which he encountered it.)
<P>
This early twentieth-century ethnographic paradigm descends from German
romanticism, especially from Herder.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 But Harrisson's Worktown
study must also be seen in connection with the more recent and homespun
Victorian tradition in which, as Peter Keating writes, "a representative
of one class consciously sets out to explore, analyse and report upon, the
life of another class lower in the social scale than his own," attempting
to "become part of" the group under investigation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Revived
by Orwell, Priestley, and others in the 1930s, this tradition gives a
local, British habitation to the ethnographic implications present in
romanticism but not given full theoretical elaboration or scientific
authority until the first decades of <I>this</I> century, at which time
they were "exported" to far-flung "primitive cultures."

Describing his road to Mass-Observation on a 1938 BBC program devoted
to the movement, Harrisson recalled,

I went to an island in the Pacific called Malekula and spent three years
there living among cannibals, whom I found were neither better nor worse
than old Harrovians. I tried to get an inside picture of their customs

lived . . . Then I came back to England and went to live in a Lancashire
industrial town, trying to apply the same principles of observation to
our civilisation.

The dialectic of mobility and immobility obtained in the Victorian works,
too, for an overriding impression one gets from reading the bourgeois
literature of social exploration--from the social-problem novels as well
as from social research reports--is that "the poor" are in some powerful
sense always <I>there,</I> always where the free-ranging investigator
can find them, as if awaiting his visit to their squalid habitats. Not
only in such works as Henry Mayhew's <I>London Labour and the London
Poor</I> (1861-1862; New York: Dover, 1969), but in novels like
those of Gaskell and Disraeli, the human objects of exploration tend to
be defined (in the sense of "fenced in") in contrast to the explorer's and
the novelist's free-moving personae. Dickens carried this tendency to its
extreme in the passage in <I>Bleak House</I> when Inspector Bucket visits
the slum called Tom-All-Alone's: its denizens appear "like a concourse of
imprisoned demons," their district resembling a Dantescan circle of hell,
beyond the "verge" of which they cannot pass.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 That Dickens
recognized this for a comforting illusion, answering a need to believe
the threatening internal alien <I>containable,</I> is evident from the
plot of <I>Bleak House,</I> with the contaminating connections it draws
between Jo and Esther, Nemo and Lady Dedlock. But the illusion was the
norm. The 
<b></b>
Worktown project follows the nineteenth-century literature
of social exploration in performing the paradoxical task of elevating its
objects to a level at which they deserve bourgeois sympathy--bringing them
"closer" by showing them not as beasts or savages but as participants
in culture--while keeping them at a distance, behind that dividing wall
that secures them a culture "of their own" in the first place. And at the
same time, the social explorer emerges as someone both flexible enough to
"immerse" in the alien and proof against that destructive element into
which he has plunged.
<P>
In spite of Harrisson's characteristic bravado about the ease with which
he infiltrated the working class (he always liked to present himself as
a protean re, an unplaceable self), most of his upper-middle-class
colleagues testified to the vast "gulf that separated [them] from [the]
English workers, the gulf of education, language, accent and social
behavior."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 And this raises a crucial question. How could
the arduous border-crossing ethnographic effort they were engaged in,
this temporary occupation of, or half-inside-half-outside relation to
the space of the Other, constitute an Anthropology of <I>Ourselves?</I>
It could be accepted as doing so only from a perspective for which
the claims of the more embracing imagined community of the nation
<I>overrode</I> the relativistic claims made on behalf of the local
or class-specific (working-class) culture, even at the cost of
self-contradiction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 In "A Thousand Mass-Observers," the
authors advert to the ultimate objective of "a linking up of many
local surveys into a national survey"; elsewhere Harrisson wrote
of M-O's ultimate objective of "a cultural survey of the British
Isles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 M-O's inclination to envision this possibility, to
turn differences into mere varieties of sameness, was an overdetermined
one. Referring to the development of anthropology, we can see that behind
Harrisson's ideal lay what might have been the cautionary example of
the 1890s' Ethnographic Survey of the United Kingdom, sponsored by the
British Association for the Advancement of Science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 This
vast and ambitious undertaking was driven in part by the desire to unify
the peoples of the U.K. after a period of reawakened class and ethnic
conflict, but its abandonment in 1899 suggested that no grand theory, no
internally consistent account of the whole, would magically arise from
its tireless amassing of data. With regard to the thirties proper, Tom
Jeffery has made the valuable argument that the social crisis in Britain
between 1936 and 1939 differed from those earlier spasms of 1918 to 1924
and 1929 to 1933 in that it was felt as "affecting all classes with equal
intensity," as "characterised not by class conflict but by a felt need
for national unity, a concept likely, for many reasons, to appeal to the
middle class" (<I>M-O:SH,</I> 9). And by looking from another angle we
can note that in many ways, the thirties harked back to the Victorian
era's Hungry Forties, during which middle-class writers, politicians,
and planners also took it upon themselves to be the instruments of
a moral national unification. The mid-Victorian "Condition of England
question," the perception of Two Nations unhappily coexisting in Britain,
were reprised in Thirties Britain, and so was the assumption that the
bourgeois social researcher's efforts to understand the culture of
that Other Nation would be carried on <I>with the ultimate purpose of
subsuming that culture within the national whole.</I> To 
<b></b>
say this
is really to describe the plots of most of those social problem novels
of the 1840s and after. For works such as these, the only reason for
commencing the sympathetic ethnographic study of that so-called other
nation of the workers or the poor was that in the final analysis it
was not felt to be a different nation, people, or culture at all, but
a severed member of the British body politic that had to be sutured
back in place. In the Victorian period, the merely political unity of
a nation that had long known itself to be ethnically mixed (after the
model of Defoe's "heterogeneous thing," the "True-Born Englishman")
was called upon to do cultural work as the largest conceivable
culture there was. This is why appeals to "brotherhood" and "family"
in the social problem works were always appeals to <I>national</I>
kinship involving the sometimes explicit spurning of international
(potentially Communistic) connections. Consider, for instance, the
critique of telescopic philanthropy in Dickens' <I>Bleak House,</I> or
the arguments in Gaskell's <I>Mary Barton</I> about how employers bear
Christian responsibilities to their employees while those employees must
accept lower wages so as to defeat foreign competitors: the interests
of the two classes are shown to be the same <I>over against</I> the
interests of their counterparts in other nations. Christian universalism
notwithstanding, in Gaskell neither the British employers nor their
workers are called on to remember their Christian responsibilities
to, say, French or German workers. Mass-Observation was the inheritor
of this legacy, in which the Mayhewesque "travels into the poor man's
country" always turned into travels into our own, and ethnography of the
so-called Other Nation always turned into a more encompassing nation-wide
auto-ethnography. Speaking for Ourselves became a matter of adding our
voices to the nation's self-defining narrative.
<P>
Charles Madge's National Panel was motivated by a different sense of
anthropology, governed by metaphors of space and motion complementary to
those I have described. It is evident from sources such as the pamphlet
soliciting material for <I>May the Twelfth</I> that one of Madge's aims
was to use the resources of Mass-Observation to help people liberate
themselves from the shackles of custom and superstition, the mind-forg'd
manacles, under which they labored in contemporary Britain--such as
those surrounding the monarchy. In this, Madge drew in part upon the
modernist primitivism of decades past, which had made the likening of
Western peoples and "savages" a reflex. But he also reached back much
farther, to Enlightenment notions. In the 1784 essay that asked "What
is Enlightenment?" Kant had given the answer that it was "man's release
from his self-incurred tutelage." Those who permitted themselves to avoid
using their reason (and as Kant saw it, this included much of the world's
population and nearly all women) sentenced themselves to an everlasting
childhood and made it "easy for others to set themselves up as their
guardians."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Mass-Observation's anthropology of ourselves,
then, could also be seen as bringing critical consciousness to bear
upon our own most habitual and even sacred customs: as Kant had written
in the <I>Critique of Pure Reason,</I> "to criticism everything must
submit."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 This understanding of the task was also colored by
the anxiety-ridden ideas about mass psychology which had been expressed in
works like Gustave Le Bon's 1895 study <I>The Crowd</I> and had received
a new lease on life in the era of Fascist state 
<b></b>
spectacle: the man
in the crowd "is no longer himself," Le Bon had written, "but has become
an automaton who has ceased to be guided by his will."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 And
so it is that traces of Conrad's <I>Heart of Darkness,</I> of Kant, and
of Le Bon are about equally discernible in the pamphlet "Where Were You
on May 12th?" where they mingle awkwardly with traces of that newer,
pluralist ethnography I have described above. I take the liberty of
quoting at some length. On Coronation Day, we are told,

Excitement, rising to hysteria, will fill the air. Few will stop to
consider what it is all about. They will just be carried away. The
restraints of everyday life will vanish for the time being. . . . If the
ceremony were taking place among an African tribe, it would be a wonderful
day for an explorer to observe the customs of the natives and to learn
about the working of their minds. But in England, too, we can observe
such things. We need to know more about how people behave in crowds and
masses. For mass excitement can be put to worse uses that cheering a
King and Queen driving by. Many of us remember the last war and how mass
excitement deluded us then. Again, look at Germany and Italy, and what
harm has been caused by mass hysteria there. In every country these blind
passions may turn, or be turned, into wrong and harmful directions. The
best way to guard against them is to bring them into the daylight of
science. . . . We must observe ourselves and our neighbours, and keep
constant watch on the these forces of the lower mind.

This passage expresses a powerful ambivalence about the coronation and
the point of studying it--a vacillation about the relationship between
the State and the means of representation that is not a mere flaw in
<I>May the Twelfth</I> but is its very structural principle.
<P>
Involved in this principled indecision are some conflicting senses of
the "mass" that is to pertain to Mass-Observation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The
persuasion that Britain stood in desperate need of auto-anthropologizing
can be understood as deriving from the fear that the forces of unreason
associated with humanity in the mass, and evidently on the march across
the Channel, could overwhelm British people too, making it "easy for
others to set themselves up as their guardians." "Mass-Observation wants
to find out why human beings are suggestible and how they can protect
themselves against suggestions which do not help them to survive," an
early bulletin stated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 But just as we have already needed
to see the Worktown enterprise as deriving from an eighteenth-century
model (romantic cultural pluralism) adapted to nineteenth-century
British purposes, so we will have to grasp Madge's National Panel as the
product of an Enlightenment rhetoric of self-liberation filtered through
nineteenth-century British usage. Approximating the auto-ethnographic
aim of having people speak "for themselves, about themselves" much
more closely than did Harrisson's Worktown project, the National Panel
would re its mission in tropes precisely opposite to those that
were used by Harrisson's group and inscribed in modern professional
ethnography. Instead of offering a self-authorizing narrative about the
achievement of an outsider's insideness in another culture, the producers
of the nineteenth century's signature genres--the novelists and cultural
critics--told one about a position of <I>insider's outsideness</I> with
respect to their own. This was not the unreconstructed Enlightenment
ideal of a rational standpoint outside or beyond culture, but the
auto-ethnographic 
<b></b>
 mimicry of outsideness, just as outsider's
insideness is the ethnographic mimicry of the native's position
entirely inside culture. Where ethnographers adopt a stance of
participant observation, auto-ethnographers assume one of <I>participant
objectivation</I> toward the cultures that formed them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
As with the ethnographic process, we can describe a double movement
characteristic of the auto-ethnographic: where ethnography claims to
go inside the foreign but also to remain or to get back outside it,
auto-ethnography mirrors this pattern by claiming to go outside its own
culture while also remaining in or returning to it. Instead of seeking
to demonstrate their immersion in the Other, nineteenth-century writers
testified to their "rising above" the limited perspective available to
what Matthew Arnold, in <I>Culture and Anarchy,</I> disparaged as the
"ordinary self"--a self seen as coextensive with its class and role
in society, wholly the product of socialization, wholly constrained by
sectarian enmities and neglects. In the process, they fashioned a self
(Arnold's "best self," or the self imagined by Mill's <I>On Liberty</I>)
whose putative removal from the culture that produced it is achieved
for the purpose of understanding and representing that culture and has
meaning and worth only in its continuing and continually demonstrated
connection to that culture. To continue with the metaphors: looking back
from a distance or down from a height, auto-ethnographers could perceive
the whole cultural order, whereas ordinary insider's selves saw only
part. Auto-ethnographic authority affirms the culture from which it
distances itself. One <I>needs</I> one's "mass."
<P>
Sustained by both Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment ideologies,
Mass-Observation's twin projects might imply the supersession, even
the dialectical <I>sublation,</I> of what Luk&aacute;cs had called the
"antinomies of bourgeois thought."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Chief among these, for
anthropologists of Us and of Them alike, were the ideals of individual
freedom and cultural belonging, each of which came accompanied by its
negative counter-ideal: for the ideal of freedom, the vision of culture
as a prisonhouse; for the ideal of belonging, the specter of a footsore
<I>Unheimlichkeit.</I> As we have seen, the abdication crisis had supplied
one impetus for the creation of M-O by exposing "the sway of superstition
in the midst of science"
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
--and the antidote for this seems
to have been an assisted escape from self-incurred tutelage, achieveable
one volunteer at a time, not <I>en masse.</I> Viewed this way, volunteers
were not so much contributing to some collective project as assisting
themselves to rise above the superstitions of collectivity. The British
People contacted through such an enterprise fit the so-called Civic models
of nationalism, according to which subjects are linked only by the minimal
and pragmatic ties of political order and are otherwise permitted to
remain "unattached" or "at large." But the other event of late 1936 that
red in the movement's founding, especially for Madge, was the burning
of the Crystal Palace, that unparalleled symbol of Victorian national
unity constructed for the 1851 Great Exhibition. Paxton's glass-and-steel
cathedral of industry had housed the mid-Victorian extravaganza designed
to mark an end to the Hungry Forties, much as the Coronation of George
VI would present itself as marking an end--prematurely--to the great
national crises of the 1930s.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 The portion of Madge and
of M-O that 
<b></b>
responded to such appeals was the one influenced by
romantic conceptions of the nation, which favor the idea of deeper,
darker national siblinghoods. This was also the portion of M-O open to
surrealist and psychoanalytical influences, the one intrigued by the
possibility that the new science of the ordinary could give access to
"the unconscious collective life of England" in which even the most
trivial-seeming detail might signify.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Did Madge conceive
of Mass-Observation as undermining state myths of unity, like the ones
surrounding the British monarchy? Or did he intend that it should help
restore them, should rebuild the Crystal Palace in its text, much as the
Coleridge of "Kubla Khan" had promised to "build that dome in air"? Were
Mass-Observation's efforts as Madge saw them centrifugal or centripetal
in nature? As you have no doubt guessed, I will answer: both.

In the Coronation of George VI, Mass-Observation found its ultimate
anti-self (see <A HREF="4.3buzard_5.html"> 5</A>). The relationship between the events of 12 May 1937
and the Mass-Observation volume <I>May the Twelfth</I> defines a struggle
for control of the means of representation. Like the Balinese cockt
which Clifford Geertz has famously analyzed, the Coronation constituted
"a metasocial 
<b></b>
commentary," a British "reading" of British experience,
and its anthropologists tried to read it "over the shoulders" of those who
produced it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 The means in question are particularly prone to
characterization in terms of modernist aesthetics and of modern (early
twentieth-century) social thought. Rather like the Joycean artist, the
British State had converted "the bread of everyday life into something
that has a permanent artistic life of its own," making an ordinary man
into a king, a normal day into a national holy-day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Not only
had the Coronation appeared to support Durkheim's interpretation of ritual
as the enactment and symbol of collective life and as the great engine
of social consensus.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 More than this, it had furnished the
means by which the State represented <I>itself</I> as the sole entity
in Britain capable of superintending such mysteries: in anthropological
parlance, as the sorcerer or shaman who emerges as indigenous "master of
culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 In an official fiction of auto-ethnography, those
who "stood for" Britons politically (representation as <I>Vertretung</I>)
and the royals who stood for them symbolically <I>(Darstellung)</I> joined
forces to claim, in effect, that they <I>were</I> Britain, and conversely
that Britons were British only in and through them. Repeatedly described
in the medieval metaphors of the body politic, these representatives were
the <I>head</I> of the British State, the <I>members</I> of Parliament,
the <I>organs</I> of the press. Virtually all their efforts to represent
Britain were susceptible to interpretation as renderings of themselves
<I>as</I> Britain. In one <I>Times</I> entry reproduced in <I>May the
Twelfth,</I> we read of discussion in Commons concerning the pricing
of seats on the Government stands for viewing the procession. Ramsay
Macdonald outlines the plan for subsidizing the price of these seats,
in the interest of "using these stands to accommodate representatives
of the many-sided life of the nation." He goes on to say that spaces
on these stands "are not to be sold to the general public but only to
persons chosen by the groups among which the representation is to be
allotted" (<I>MT,</I> 10-11). It is difficult to know which group
of national representatives here, those seated on the benches of Commons
or those to be seated on the Government stands, represents which--but
such difficulty seems to be part of the point.
<P>
<I>May the Twelfth</I> presents itself as both record of and response
to these official efforts, at once their imitation and critique. It
answers the State's quasi-Joycean magic act in a volume resembling
those great modernist day-books like <I>Ulysses, Mrs. Dalloway, The
Waves,</I> and <I>Under the Volcano,</I> which offer to contain all
life within the single day and which oscillate between the operations
of mythologizing the ordinary and "normalizing" the mythic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
Previous critics have discerned modernist techniques at work in the book:
Samuel Hynes, for instance, compared M-O's treatment of the Coronation
pageantry to the Wandering Rocks episode in <I>Ulysses</I> and to
Eliot's witheringly satirical poem on state pomp, "Coriolan," and he
noted how <I>May the Twelfth</I> "ironically counterpoints" official
and popular reports.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Others, such as Stuart Laing and
David Chaney and Michael Pickering, have likened the book's procedures
to the cross-cutting in film and emphasized M-O's connections to the
contemporaneous documentary movement in which Humphrey Jennings was
to be such an important re.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Without disputing these
perspectives, I think we should now 
<b></b>
regard the counterpointing
or cross-cutting in relation to those disruptive textual devices
studied by Joseph Frank, through which modernist works displayed their
"spatial form"--for example, by the "interweaving of images and phrases
independently of any time-sequence of narrative" ("SFML," 49). And
a proper understanding of the use to which M-O put such devices will
take us only halfway toward an understanding of M-O's auto-ethnographic
aesthetic. As <I>May the Twelfth</I> depicts it, the State's official
auto-ethnography testified to its "coverage" of British society by
spanning the aesthetic field surveyed by Lessing's <I>Laoco&ouml;n,</I>
exploiting both temporal (narrative) and spatial (iconic, mythical) forms
to solicit Britons' investment in the rites of state. Mass-Observation's
challenge was to counteract this purportedly complete account by using
space against the official version's time, time against its space. And as
its techniques aim to negate those of the State, M-O renders itself the
"new master of social magic," the production of <I>May the Twelfth</I>
becoming "a transforming ritual curiously shamanistic in its own right,"
by means of which M-O "takes on the shaman's knowledge and authority
even as [it] represents the scientific interpretation, and hence the
secular negation, of the shaman's occult culture of magic."

The narrative which the Coronation sought to tell was one of death
and rebirth, of continuity's triumph over rupture: every coronation's
narrative is this one, though the crowning of 1937 had extra reasons
for affirming it. As the first chapter of <I>May the Twelfth</I> makes
plain, it was also a tale, especially dear perhaps to imperial powers, of
mastery over chaos. Much of this initial chapter, entitled "Preparations,"
consists of clippings from various British newspapers collected over
the three months preceding May 12th. The cumulative weight of all this
material is to give evidence of the State's determination to impress
us with its foresight and managerial expertise. The exhibits placed
on display by Madge and Jennings bear witness to the State's pursuit
of auto-ethnographic authority: they conjure up great menacing packs
of detail which the authority promises to bring to heel in producing
one orderly spectacle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 The opening chapter of <I>May
the Twelfth</I> makes plain the role of the Fleet Street press and of
Parliamentary question time in portraying the State as the one body that
can rise above, survey, and navigate the swamp of facticity surrounding
Britain's central ritual. We learn much about the careful design and
wording of the official summonses, the schemes for decorations, the
estimated cost of erecting viewing stands, the number of miles of steel
tubing needed to construct the stands ("enough to reach out from London
to Basle, in Switzerland"), the niceties of diplomacy (how to receive
the German delegation?), the arrangements for accommodations, for traffic
control, for broadcasting, for censoring of newsreel footage--and so on,
and so on. The narrative suggested by all these clippings gathers momentum
toward the inevitable destination of the crowning and seeks to engage
readers in the suspense--will the event come off, will all the dragons of
detail be slain?--of its national comic plot. This fictive-journalistic
enterprise furnished what Benedict Anderson calls "[t]he idea of a
sociological organism moving calendrically through homogeneous, empty
time," enacted through "the almost precisely simultaneous consumption
('imagining') of the newspaper-as-fiction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>

<P>
Mass-Observation's re-presentation of this implicit official story about
the demonstratively difficult act of representation in which the State
was engaged also makes a point of demonstrating <I>its</I> difficulty,
<I>its</I> victory over facticity: we are told of M-O's "library of
press-cuttings" consisting of "about 5,000 [items]," collected "from
national and provincial newspapers and periodicals" and worked over by
editorial alchemy to yield eighty-five pages of entries. Against the
State's far-reaching network for handling the financial, technological,
and logistical dimensions of the Coronation, M-O offers its miniature
network of observers linked by mail and telephone (cf. <I>MT,</I> 89-
90). And M-O responds to the State's tale of conquest over obstacles by
scuttling the consensus-coercing momentum of its narrative, invading it
with contradictory material (on popular indifference, on plans gone awry,
on petty strife arising from the planning for the day). The most audacious
of many such juxtapositions concludes the chapter, pitting the gushing
<I>Times</I> editorial for 12 May ("The Crown is the necessary centre,
not of political life only, but of all life!") against Harry Pollitt's
message in <I>The Daily Worker</I> for the same day.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 The
effect of such orchestrated clashes in the "Preparations" chapters is
not only to indicate how partial is the State's putative totalization,
but to thwart the affective allure of the form in which that totalization
sought partial expression.
<P>
The remaining sections of <I>May the Twelfth</I> have by and large a
complementary function, in reaction to the other aesthetic made use of by
the State. Like the life of the nation as it is officially represented,
the book "centers" on the twelfth of May itself, but here M-O's task is
to reconsign to "normal" temporal flux what the State presents as the
epiphanic instant of the crowning. As in modernist spatial form, in the
Coronation's climactic moment "[p]ast and present [were to be] apprehended
spatially, locked in a timeless unity"; the rite manifested itself as what
Mircea Eliade would label "a revolt against historical time," in favor
of a state of mind for which "the actions and events of a particular time
[are] only the bodying forth of eternal prototypes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Against
the ritual's powerful antihistorical, gravitational force, M-O mobilizes
that empty, homogeneous time of the everyday, charted in what come to
seem the aggressively adventitious adventures of an unsolicited populace.
<P>
This effect is nowhere clearer than in the contrast between the
officially-covered plans for the "culminating point in the Coronation
Ceremony" and the Mass-Observers' circumambulation of that moment. At
the precise instant when "Dr. Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, places
the crown on the King's head," wrote the <I>Daily Telegraph,</I>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[t]he fact that the King has been crowned will be proclaimed officially
by the firing of guns. Elaborate arrangements are being made to ensure
that the firing synchronizes with the ceremony. Direct telephone lines
are being installed from the Abbey to artillery batteries in St. James's
Park, the Tower and Windsor, the three chief firing points. An observer
stationed in a box in the Abbey will be watching the ceremony, and the
moment the Archbishop places the crown on the King's head he will give
the signal to fire simultaneously to the batteries. The authorities
are not relying on the telephone alone. Wireless will be installed to
ensure that the firing takes place at the precise

moment. A special
signalling set is being installed on which the observer will flash a
message to the batteries. [<I>MT,</I> 15]

If we look in the Chapter on "London on May 12" (over 100 pages after
the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> excerpt), we find a six-page section headed
"Diffusion of the Abbey service to spectators of the procession:
10.35-1.50 p.m.," which centers upon the carnivalesque paragraph 54:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
At 12.40 at Hyde Park Corner the sound reproduction was definitely not
good. The large numbers of wandering people distracted attention from the
Crowning. On the words "His Majesty King George VI is acclaimed" there
is a moment of indecision among the seat-holders--whether to stand up or
not--and by all whether to take off hats or not. The seat-holders cheer
first, then as the Abbey cheering comes through they stand up. About
half the men in the general crowd raise or take off their hats. Two
ice-cream boys push each other about in fun because one hasn't taken
his cap off. Then the crowd in Hyde Park cheers and the first gun
goes off. All this inside half a minute. Then someone in Piccadilly
gives a long single cheer and odd people near me laugh. As the organ
swells up a periscope-seller lurches forward with an almost drunk mock
intonation. Coming away from Hyde Park Corner the guns continue and a
little boy with his mouth full of ice-cream asks his father "What are they
firing the guns for? What are they firing the guns for?" [<I>MT,</I> 126]

"Diffusion," indeed: one feels that a more appropriate heading to such an
entry might be "Petering Out of the Message Among its Audience." A motto
for this little prose ode to the power of the quotidian is given a page
later: "Atmospherics disturb the solemn tone." The <I>Daily Telegraph</I>
had assured its public that the crowning would occur "shortly after noon,"
and that "rehearsals and tests with stop watches" would "fix the time
within two or three minutes"; <I>May the Twelfth'</I>s only account of the
moment shows it as behind schedule and badly transmitted to an uncertain
and easily distractable, yet energizingly entropic, aggregate. Ironies
attach to the fact that the setting of M-O's substitute for the magic
moment is associated with the so-called Hyde Park riots that impelled
Matthew Arnold to compose <I>Culture and Anarchy,</I> his celebration
of the State as guardian of our best self, and that its landmarks are
those commemorating the national savior, the reactionary Wellington
(Wellington Arch, Apsley House). The mock-drunken periscope seller
supplies the self-reflexive element in paragraph 54, as a kind of Lord
of Misrule whose job it is to enable people to <I>see</I> the ritual
for what it is--in other words as the re who represents it "from
the bottom up." Passages like this one throughout <I>May the Twelfth</I>
celebrate precisely what Lord Robert Cecil lamented when he wrote, after
a Victorian state spectacle, that "in England . . . some malignant
spell broods over all our most solemn ceremonials, and inserts into
them some feature which makes them all ridiculous. . . . 
<b></b>
Something
always breaks down, somebody contrives to escape doing his part, or some
bye-motive is suffered to interfere and ruin it all."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
<P>
The labor of dispelling state magic and of negating its centripetal force
is carried on by stages in <I>May the Twelfth.</I> The "Preparations"
chapter gives way to one on "London on May 12," showing the meandering
anti-pageant taking place in the city's streets, pubs, railway and tube
stations, offices, restaurants, and parks from midnight to midnight: the
authors and subjects of these entries are the milling human traffic which
the State had pledged itself to regulate--evidently with indifferent
success. They are anything but the immobilized and contacted culture
of contemporaneous ethnography or State auto-ethnography: they will
<I>not</I> keep in their places. Next comes a chapter on activities
elsewhere in Britain ("National Activities," in context an ironic title),
then one on "Individual Reactions." The impression conveyed by this steady
outward motion (from the Parliament and Abbey to the streets of London;
from London to the provinces; from the State to the individual) is the
precise opposite of the one sought through the State's system of guns,
phones, and telegraphs: an impression of the draining away of the ritual's
nation-evoking power. The book ends with a section called "The Normal Day
Survey," which appears to complete this scattering process, this return to
the mundane. Identified not as chapter five but as part two (<I>MT,</I>
vii), as if the editors want it to be seen as the structural equal of
all four chapters devoted to the Coronation, this section offers samples
from the volunteer observers' reports for 12 <I>March,</I> returning to
the editors' stated principle that "[a]s a rule, . . . Mass-Observation
will be dealing with everyday things rather than special occasions"
(MT <I>vi</I>). <I>May the Twelfth</I> contains the crucial event of
the day as an undervalued and scarcely-regarded component of its larger
vision of popular and normal life, reversing the State's attempt to
include the popular and normal as an undervalued and scarcely-regarded
(and condescended-to) component of its event: "Preparations" refers to
the "four workpeople" drawn from various portions of the nation (from
Scotland, Wales, Birmingham, and Chesterfield) who had been "surprised
and delighted" by the King's "personally inviting them to be present at
the Coronation," and to two London busmen "honoured by the King in the
Coronation Honours List" (<I>MT,</I> 6, 81). M-O's proclivity when it
operates in this mode is like that of the character Bernard in Virginia
Woolf's <I>The Waves</I> : with him it might confess, "Let a man
get up and say, 'Behold, this is the truth,' and instantly I perceive
a sandy cat filching a piece of fish in the background. Look, you have
forgotten the cat, I say."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
<P>
Not surprisingly, M-O drew fire for its "many pages of dreary minutiae,"
both from the mainstream press and from academic authorities. A reviewer
in <I>The Listener</I> complained that M-O's "facts simply multiply like
maggots in a cheese and leave no shape behind them" (cited in <I>FYW,</I>
61, 58). In "A Nation-Wide Intelligence Service," Malinowski insisted
that the movement would not arrive at the dignity of social science
until it had grasped the "clear distinction between the relevant and the
adventitious; between the sociological law . . . on the one hand, and
sundry happenings
<b></b>
 or subjective reactions on the other" (<I>FYW,</I>
85). The "indefinitely and infinitely varied minor diversities of feeling,
idea, or even behaviour" could not provide the basis for social knowledge
(<I>FYW,</I> 118). But a significant portion of Mass- Observation's vexed
principles were devoted to the adventitious and sundry, the trivial
and banal. Obstinately <I>not</I> meaning anything, not fitting in,
these were endowed with the virtue of intransigence. Like the early
T.S. Eliot of "Preludes," Mass-Observation was half in love with the
human and material detritus of modern life, which could intimate, but
stopped short of "representing,"

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
M-O's "suffering thing" was the mobile British populace, target of
the State's symbolic violence but stubbornly anterior to or outside of
state signification and shy of assuming alternative nationhood. Where
Malinowski wrote that "the close study of such exceptional situations [as
the Coronation] . . . may give the clue to much that is baffling in the
uniform and impassive surface of everyday things" (<I>FYW,</I> 108), M-O
would imply that normal British life afforded no mystery to be solved, no
"depth," only what there was, in plain view and plentiful supply. <I>May
the Twelfth'</I>s "neglect[ing] or tak[ing] for granted the limelight
proceedings in Westminster Abbey" struck the functionalist master as the
book's greatest failing; any respectable scientist would have focused
upon the issues of "what the function of the crowning ritual is for
the institution of monarchy, and what monarchy means for the nation"
(<I>FYW,</I> 111-12). But the self- imposed restrictions involved in
this state-favoring orientation to social research prevented Malinowski
from considering that M-O had in fact answered his question about the
crowning spectacle: "How far and in what form did it create the national
unity which it was its first and foremost task to establish?" (<I>FYW,</I>
113). His was a science that could not take "no" for an answer.
<P>
<I>May the Twelfth</I> could not "succeed," of course: what would success
mean, and how could it succeed without (or outside of) meaning? Its
insurmountable problem was not simply the (functionalist) objection facing
all Weapons-of-the-Weak approaches to the study of popular culture--namely
that in stressing the degree of freedom from state coercion and
signification achieved through the many small campaigns of the everyday,
they do not consider that the putative "subversions" they celebrate may
in the long run shore up rather than challenge authority, by siphoning
off dangerous energies in trivial or ephemeral protests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
More fundamentally, the very conception of the Normal or Popular in
Mass-Observation seemed fated to cede priority to that Official in
whose embrace it must ever lie. In <I>May the Twelfth</I> and in the
other day-surveys of 1937, the "normal day" promised sometimes to elude
official representation, sometimes to elude the order of representation
<I>tout court,</I> as something "beyond culture." Yet the very structure
of <I>May the Twelfth</I> demonstrates that mythic and normal days are
what they are only by their opposition to each other, that the Normal
is a category within and dependent upon the semiotic order of culture,
<b></b>
that it contains those signs recognized within the culture for
expressing "anti-cultural" energies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Not for nothing did
Charles Madge select the twelfth day of each month as the day about
which his volunteers should write (beginning with February 1937); this
choice was made in the knowledge that the Coronation would take place
on 12 May, so that what stood for the quotidian was grasped from the
outset by its differential relation to the Meaningful, the ritualized,
the State-controlled. Madge and Jennings seem to have been unable to
avoid giving about half of their energy to the task of completing the
one great national portrait or story, the one grand auto-ethnography,
rather than to the single-minded construction of the picture or story
of difference-within-the-nation, of difference that would never need
or tend to <I>become</I> "nation." In this they aligned themselves once
more with the latter-day modernism of their time. This was an aesthetic
whose newly learned hospitality to national traditions and resonances was
impelling it toward rations of cultural authority from the perspective
of which a nation's factions might appear, as T.S. Eliot would put it,
"[u]nited in the strife which divided them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 M-O would
have had to concur with the Auden of 1941, who bid farewell to partisan
politics and quoted Montaigne in his epigraph to <I>The Double Man:</I>

we disbelieve, and cannot rid ourselves of what we condemn."

M-O liked to exaggerate this number, referring in 1939 to "some two
thousand voluntary observers," though this would have meant counting
everyone who had responded only one time. Angus Calder gives the
re of 420, along with other res on the number of volunteers
between 1937 and 1939, in "Mass-Observation 1937-1949," in Martin
Bulmer, ed., <I>Essays on the History of British Social Research</I>
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), 132; citing the work
of Nicholas Stanley, he adds that 97% of the original group were
middle class, 72% were male. Among many discrepancies between that
composition of the M-O panel and the general population, 80% of the male
participants in M-O were under 35, as compared to 53% of the general
population. Cf. Nicholas S. Stanley, <I>"The Extra Dimension": A Study
and Assessment of the Methods Employed by Mass-Observation in its First
Period, 1937-40,</I> Ph.D. diss, Birmingham Polytechnic, 1981. A
different account entirely is given in the M-O pamphlet "A Thousand
Mass-Observers" (1937 or 1938) which says "Early in 1937, fifty people in
different parts of the country agreed to co-operate in making observations
on how they and other people spend their daily lives" and that after
the appearance of and publicity given to the introductory pamphlet
<I>Mass-Observation</I> (published in June 1937 by Frederick Muller),
"more than a thousand people . . . applied to be Observers." Cf. "A

The OED's first documented use of the phrase dates from 1924

Consider, for example, the following passages from Powdermaker's
<I>Stranger and Friend.</I> Ethnography as an instantaneous image of
split self: "To understand a strange society, the anthropologist has
traditionally immersed himself in it, learning, as far as possible,
to think, see, feel, and sometimes act as a member of its culture and
at the same time as a trained anthropologist from another culture"
. Ethnography as a narrative sequence of entrance and withdrawal:
"Consumed with self-consciousness, I imagined my family and friends
sitting in the background and muttering in disapproving tones, 'Hortense,
dancing with the savages!' How could I get up before all these people of
the Stone Age and dance with them? . . . But there I was in my proper
place in the circle; the drums began; I danced. Something happened. I
forgot myself and was one with the dancers. Under the full moon and
for the brief time of the dance, I ceased to be an anthropologist from
a modern society. I danced. When it was over I realized that, for this
short period, I had been emotionally part of the rite. Then out came my
notebook" .

In her recent <I>Making a Social Body: British Cultural Formation,

Mary Poovey borrows from Lorraine Daston the notion of an "historical
epistemology" whose field "allows for the production of what counts
as knowledge at any given moment" . For Daston, cf. "Historical
Epistemology," in James Chandler, Arnold I. Davidson, and Harry
Harootunian, eds., <I>Questions of Evidence: Proof, Practice, and

object or horizon of knowledge also has a history. "The nation" is
always <I>there</I> throughout the century from 1840-1940, but
it periodically becomes the great desideratum of social knowledge and
representation, without which no social knowledge or representation

In intellectual circles today, it is fashionable to argue that modernism
and its counterpart, avant-gardism, as the dominant "world views" that
influenced the nature of style for most of the twentieth century, have
been replaced by postmodernism, not only in the arts but in popular
culture. According to a French scholar, "Avant-garde art still exists but
it treads water and upsets no one. . . . Modern art no longer scandalizes
its public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 It has become the new academy, a new form of
official art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>


<P>
Modernism and avant-gardism, which presume the existence of clear-cut
distinctions between different types of aesthetic endeavors, are
perceived today as elitist in comparison with postmodernism, in which
high culture is no longer viewed as aesthetically superior to popular
culture and dominant cultures are no longer more significant than
minority cultures. The shift from modernist to postmodernist styles is
viewed as a consequence of social, political, and cultural changes that
have altered the relationships between different social groups and the
dominant culture, as well as the ways in which these social groups can
be plausibly represented by cultural categories.

<P>
The enormous proliferation of different forms of popular culture (cinema,
television, and popular music) transmitted by film and electronic
media has made it difficult to ignore the aesthetic influence of these
cultures in everyday life, and, at the same time, has had the effect of
marginalizing traditional arts, such as painting, theatre, dance, poetry,
and experimental music. The concept of two cultures, one aesthetically
superior and identified with the arts as traditionally defined, and the

<b></b>
other aesthetically trivial and identified with culture produced
for mass audiences, has ceased to be convincing. From the postmodernist
perspective, all forms of culture today mix elements from different
styles and different time periods, erasing the distinctions between high
and low cultures and between dominant and minority cultures.

<P>
Unfortunately, the enormous amount of discussion and debate about the
significance and impact of these types of styles has created what are
in fact stereotypical images of both postmodernism and modernism, and
particularly the role of avant-gardes. As Wilson has observed, our
"generalizations begin to seem to have more to do with the creation
of a cultural myth about 'our times' which . . . seeks to create a
stereotype of the present in the present."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The modernist
avant-garde is characterized in terms of its alleged aloofness from
popular culture and political concern rather than in terms of its
critique of modernity, specifically the latter's commitment to the
belief in progress.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Avant-garde art tends to be identified
with its post-World War II phase of experimentation with artistic form,
while its engagements with political issues in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries are forgotten (<I>PC,</I> 237). Instead of
being aloof from popular culture in the late nineteenth century, French
avant-garde artists often appropriated motifs from certain aspects of
popular culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Curiously, while the avant-garde tends to be
derided in discussions of postmodernism, the concept has not been entirely
abandoned. Postmodern artists, while eliminating clear distinctions
between popular culture and art in their works, are sometimes described as
using avant-garde strategies. Boyne and Rattansi argue that postmodernists
in relation to their battle against modernism constitute an avant-garde
in the same sense as the dadaists and surrealists in their opposition
to post-impressionism ("TPP," 10). Connor describes postmodernists as
using "a lexicon of cultural subversion and deconstruction which is
partly inherited from modernist culture and its avant-garde theories"
(<I>PC,</I> 166- 67).

<P>
At the same time, some writers have argued that postmodern
theorists exaggerate the extent to which postmodernity has replaced
modernity. Kellner suggests that there may be "continuities" as well as
"discontinuities" between the two types of societies and suggests the
relevance of Williams' distinction between "residual," "dominant," and
"emergent" cultures. "Using Williams' distinctions we might want to
speak of postmodernity as an emergent tendency within a still dominant
modernity which is haunted as well by various forms of residual,
traditional cultures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>


<P>
Collins has pointed to "the simultaneous presence of [postmodernism]
alongside modernist, pre-modernist, and aggressively non-modernist styles,
all enjoying significant degrees of popularity with different audiences
and institutions" (quoted in <I>PC,</I> 177). Wilson provides an example,
that of a subcultural style, punk, as "modernist, as postmodernist,
and as an avant-garde manifestation" ("NCS," 214). In the past fifteen
years, the electronic media have appropriated the looks and tactics of
the avant-garde. Caldwell claims that "every framework of the avant-garde
. . . had become highly visible in some form in the corporate world of
the new television."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Kaplan, in 
<b></b>
an attempt to classify
music videos in the 1980s, found that all the categories she identified
used avant-garde strategies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 One of her video categories
was postmodernist. Some advertisements, particularly for clothing
manufacturers, replace clarity with ambiguity in order to attract the
attention of a public so sated with advertising messages it no longer
bothers to notice them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 One technique has been to present
ambiguous images whose connotations are unclear and which do not appear to
have an obvious connection with the product being advertised. Sometimes
these images are intended to be disturbing or at least provocative,as
Goldman and his colleagues note: "To confuse further the ideological
field, some advertisers now actively encourage multiple readings as they
try to recapture the attention of alienated viewers by encoding messages
that are ambiguous, incomplete, or polyvalent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>


<P>
The assimilation by the mass media of stylistic devices associated with
the avant-garde raises the question of the extent to which oppositional
themes are being disseminated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Goldman and his collaborators
note: ". . . behind the apparent ideological randomness of the ads and
the multitude of different voices with which they address viewers, lie
the familiar guiding assumptions of commodity consumption and a remarkable
ideological regularity structured by the framework of ads."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P>
Kaplan points out that oppositional messages are likely to be "overridden
by the plethora of surrounding texts" (<I>RRC,</I> 65). The sheer volume
of messages of all kinds being transmitted by the mass media tends to
obliterate the effect of oppositional messages when they do appear; high
culture, in contrast, framed oppositional messages in such a way as to
highlight their effect: an entire evening at the theater devoted to a
particular playwright, an entire gallery or museum wing devoted to the
work of a particular artist for several weeks. Finally, as some of the
properties of high culture are being absorbed by certain forms of popular
culture, the hierarchalization of culture is being replicated in the
latter: popular music is being reclassified in terms of "classics" and
"non-classics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>


<P>
These ambiguities in the discussion of the relationship between
postmodernism, modernism, and avant-gardism suggest that it is useful
to rethink conceptions of the nature, meaning, and significance
of avant-gardism and postmodernism in contemporary culture. In this
paper, I will examine these issues as they appear in the work of fashion
designers. Fashion with its emphasis on images and incessant change ought
to constitute the epitome of a postmodernist cultural form. Its aesthetic
content is often seen as trivial and its social content as promoting
narcissism and self-absorption on the one hand and thoughtless consumption
of unnecessary products on the other. To what extent do fashion designers
engage in avant-gardist, as opposed to postmodernist, practices? Can the
history of fashion design be interpreted in terms of distinct genres or
styles that prescribed aesthetic conventions and traditions against which
avant-gardes rebelled? Have these genres disappeared and been replaced
by parody and pastiche, the hallmarks of postmodernism?

<P>
Two authors who have written extensively about the sociology of fashion
disagree on this point. While Wilson finds some elements of parody and
self-parody in contemporary 
<b></b>
 fashion design that appear to fit a
postmodernist outlook, she argues that other characteristics, such as
pastiche and the "nostalgia mode" that supposedly are indicative of
postmodernist style "have been pervasive in popular culture (including
fashion) throughout the twentieth century and . . . earlier" ("NCS,"
226). She is skeptical of the existence of a postmodern zeitgeist or
ethos as defined by leading postmodern theorists such as Jameson and
Baudrillard.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Significantly, Yves Saint Laurent, who does
not perceive himself as postmodernist, has been described as basing
his collections on "allusions to a treasure trove of sources ranging
from Proust to the theatre, styles of painting, and, as times go, even
references to his own work."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>


<P>
By contrast, Kaiser and her colleagues point to the heterogeneity
in 'fashionable' looks, the blurring of binary categories, and the
manipulation and violation of cultural codes by fashion designers as
indications of the presence of a postmodernist outlook.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

The incoherence of styles in the aggregate leads to pervasive ambiguity
in the appearances that consumers construct from the array of styles in
the postmodernist fashion marketplace.

<P>
For this analysis, I will draw examples from the activities of fashion
designers, past and present, who have worked or shown their collections in
France since that country has been the center of fashion in the Western
world for the past two hundred years. Paris remains the center of the
international fashion world as the place where contemporary designers are
compelled to display their work in order to obtain both recognition as
innovators and a foothold in the global market. It has been in the past,
and remains today, a location for the display of highly innovative designs
that are not necessarily adopted immediately.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 At the same
time, fashion design in Paris and elsewhere has acquired the institutional
trappings of the art world. Fashion museums, sometimes called costume
institutes, collect and preserve clothes from previous centuries,
obtain clothes from contemporary designers as they appear, and produce
retrospectives of the work of leading designers. The auction market, a
major center for the sale of works in the fine arts, now includes sales
of designer clothing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 As did their counterparts earlier in
the century, successful designers often assume the role of collector,
patron of the arts, and exemplar of upper class taste. First, however,
it is necessary to identify elements of avant-gardism and postmodernism
in cultural styles.

1. Avant-gardist and Postmodernist Aesthetic Practices
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Analysis of a wide range of uses of the term, avant-garde, shows that
it has been applied to three types of changes: in the aesthetic content
of art, in the social content of art, and in the norms surrounding
the production and distribution of art works. For example, the term
"avant-garde" is applied to the aesthetic content of art objects when
those works represent a redefinition of conventions for creating art,
often in such a way that they are perceived as violating taboos and
as shocking or offensive, or when they involve the use of new tools
or techniques, or concern with
<b></b>
 the nature of use of techniques
<I>per se</I>, and when they redefine what can be considered an art
work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The term is applied to the social content of art works
when they express social or political values that are critical of or
different from the dominant culture, when they attack art institutions,
and when they attempt to redefine the boundaries between high and popular
culture. Finally, the term is applied to creators of art works when they
attempt to redefine the social context for the production of art (for
example, appropriate role models, critics, and publics for artists), the
organizational context in which art is displayed and distributed, and
the social role of the artist in terms of his or her participation in
other social institutions, such as education, religion, and politics. By
any standards the term "avant-garde" can cover a wide range of aesthetic
and social practices.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>


<P>
Postmodernism is difficult to characterize in part because of its
preoccupation with ambiguity and contradiction. According to Boyne
and Rattansi, "Many doubt whether the term can ever be dignified by
conceptual coherence" ("TPP," 9). Postmodernism obliterates categories
and classifications. As a result, it seems to be characterized more by
qualities that it does not have than by qualities it has. Postmodernist
works are polysemic, having no fixed meanings or, to put it differently,
multiple meanings. Authoritative interpretations of texts are neither
expected nor possible. In postmodernist works, signifiers are unstable,
changing, contradictory, or disconnected. Binary oppositions between
signifiers are blurred (<I>RRC,</I> 55). Signifiers are 'collaged'
together but often fail to produce coherent sequences (<I>RAS,</I>
200). In place of the modernist's commitment to the development of a
particular style, the postmodernist is not interested in style conceived
as a consistent, integrated set of aesthetic elements but in pastiche and
bringing together disparate elements from many previous texts, regardless
of whether they produce a coherent entity. Because many of the texts that
postmodernists plunder are works that were widely disseminated in the past
and hence meaningful to many people, postmodernism creates feelings of
nostalgia for the past. According to Goldman, the meaning of postmodernist
texts cannot be discerned from analyzing the texts themselves, but only
by asking where the elements in the text come from (<I>RAS,</I> 214).

<P>
The social content or significance of the postmodernist work is
not that of opposition to the dominant culture but that of exposing
or reinterpreting subversive elements in the dominant culture and
in minority cultures. According to Connor, "Much postmodern aesthetic
theory . . . attempts to restore the repressed political dimensions of
aesthetic and cultural activity of all kinds" (<I>PC,</I> 224).

<P>
The social context of postmodernism in terms of an organizational
environment for the production or display of these works is left
unspecified. Unlike the works of modernist avant-gardes, which were
generally created and displayed in very distinct settings in a relatively
small number of major Western cities, postmodernist works are created
in a great variety of settings, ranging from organizations that produce
culture on an industrial scale to small groups that belong to minority
cultures and work with very minimal resources.

2. Fashion Design and the Emergence of an Avant-garde
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The connections between fashion and the avant-garde are intriguing because
both are concerned with what one art critic described years ago as "the
shock of the new." However, the two terms have very different connotations
in the popular mind. The term "fashion," particularly when applied to
clothing, refers to a phenomenon that is new but has been rapidly and
widely accepted, implying that its acceptance does not require a major
shift in world view on the part of the public. It is in tune with the
zeitgeist. By contrast, the term "avant-garde" implies a phenomenon
that is difficult to understand because it challenges the public's
preconceptions and consequently is not immediately accepted by the public.

<P>
According to the best known model of the diffusion of fashion, new
styles are first accepted by members of the upper class and gradually
spread to members of the middle and lower classes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 When a
new style has become widely accepted, it is abandoned by the upper class
in favor of a new one. This model assumes the existence of a dominant
style that is widely followed, and is a fairly accurate description of
the diffusion of fashion in Europe and America during the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries (until, approximately, the 1960s). The role
of the fashion designer was epitomized by Charles Frederick Worth, an
Englishman who worked in Paris and created styles that were adopted by
European royalty and aristocracies and by the upper middle class and the
demimonde of courtesans and actresses. Worth initiated the tradition of
<I>haute couture,</I> clothes made to order for clients who bought them
directly from designers. Fashion design as <I>haute couture</I> emphasized
style and technique: style, such as the dominant silhouette, provided
a unifying theme; technical details provided diversity. Fashion evolved
according to its own internal dynamic, following a logical succession of
cycles based on shapes of the skirt; bell, back-fullness (the bustle),
and tubular.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Clothing had to be perfectly executed,
as customers knew that it would be carefully scrutinized at social
gatherings by friends and acquaintances. Decisions by Paris designers to
use a particular type of material or accessory had enormous consequences
for fashion industries in the Western world, affecting the prices of
textiles and sometimes the survival of entire factories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<P>
During most of this period, while clothing styles at times changed
radically, fashion change was not associated with an avant-garde. True,
some designers had considerable influence on the way women dressed in the
early twentieth century; but they rarely sought to challenge established
aesthetic conventions or comment on social relationships through their
use of clothing motifs. For example, Gabrielle Chanel, who was a major
contributor to the costume of twentieth century women, produced very
simple clothes, stripped of superfluous detail and decoration, that could
be (and were) repeated endlessly with slight variations. Her innovations
included the simple black dress that she advocated as a basic item for
every woman's wardrobe, the cardigan suit that became most famous when
she revived it in the 1950s (when she was in her seventies), and the
sweater which quickly replaced blouses for many purposes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

Her clothes were compared to uniforms and to assembly-line 
<b></b>
 products like
cars. When it first appeared, <I>Vogue</I> described her black dress
as "a Ford signed Chanel."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Her clothes were intended for
women of all social ranks, although only the rich could afford to buy
the clothes she actually sold. Since her clothes were easy to copy, her
designs were quickly made available to a very diverse clientele.

<P>
During the same period, the clothes created by another major fashion
innovator, Madeleine Vionnet, did not evolve from one season to
another, but in any particular season her collection exhibited
a complete repertoire of her major technique: different types of
draping.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Vionnet's research on drapery led to innovations
that had an enormous influence on other designers and that are still
important today. According to Milbank, "Vionnet was called the Euclid
of fashion, and geometric shapes predominate in all her collections as
decorative and functional devices . . . [her] clothes were masterpieces
of the art of dresssmaking (<I>CGD,</I> 163).

<P>
Probably the first fashion designer whose work can truly be characterized
as avant-garde was Elsa Schiaparelli, who began her career in the late
1920s. Like Chanel, she was a close friend of leading avant-garde artists
of the period, such as Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara,
and Salvador Dali; but unlike Chanel, who was primarily a patron rather
than a collaborator, Schiaparelli attempted to translate the ideas of
dada and surrealist artists into clothing design.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>


<P>
Schiaparelli's designs in the 1930s were not merely influenced by
surrealism, but constituted a very real collaboration with a group of
artists who were exploring the significance of the body and clothing in
their paintings and sculpture. The results of this collaboration were
clothes that challenged aesthetic norms and traditions prevalent in the
construction and design of Western clothing and that questioned, at times,
political and social ideologies rising in prominence during the decade.

<P>
Surrealism provided Schiaparelli with an aesthetic rationale for
engaging in outrageous experiments in which artifacts and body parts
were placed in unusual locations, such as a hat in the form of a shoe
and eyes, lips, or arms becoming decoration for dresses and coats. The
goal of the surrealists was to create new connotations for body parts
and familiar artifacts, dismantling familiar connections and creating
new, surprising alliances. The intent was to disrupt normal thought
processes, to subvert conventional meanings, and to stimulate new and
possibly irrational associations (<I>FAS,</I> 108)

<P>
With Salvador Dali, Schiaparelli collaborated on the creation of the Tear
Illusion Dress in which a dress with pictures of tears in its fabric was
paired with a cape in which the tears were real, thus violating the norm
of perfection inherent in designer clothing and intimating associations
between expensive clothing and the dilapidated clothing of the poor
(<I>FAS,</I> 114).

<P>
The difference between Schiaparelli and other designers of that period can
also be interpreted in terms of Becker's distinction between craftsmen
and artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Becker defines a craft as a compilation of
knowledge and skills that can be used to produce useful or beautiful
objects, such as pottery, furniture, and clothing. According to 
<b></b>
 Becker,
craftsmen produce their work to order--for clients or employers. For
ordinary craftsmen, utility is the major factor in evaluating his or her
creations, while for artist-craftsman beauty and aesthetic qualities are
paramount. The works of artist-craftsmen often become minor arts. They
may be displayed in museums and art galleries and win awards. These
craftsmen are less dependent on evaluation of their work by individual
clients; instead they are evaluated by a larger circle of gatekeepers,
including directors of art galleries and museum curators.

<P>
The artist-craftsman develops and perfects his techniques, rather than
subverting them. Most <I>haute couture</I> designers before the 1960s
were artist-craftsmen. One of the leading designers in Paris in the
postwar period, who epitomized the tradition of <I>haute couture</I>, was
Balenciaga whose approach has been described as follows: "Armed with a
very elaborate technique that he had himself invented, he did not cease
to develop and perfect it without abandoning the canons which constituted
his style: rigor, unremitting effort, elegance and beauty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>


<P>
The difference between these artist-craftsmen and avant-garde artists
is seen when the latter "invade" crafts. In this situation, avant-garde
artists use the skills of the craftsman, but the objects they make are
deliberately neither useful nor beautiful. Instead, the artist who is
using craft skills to make art works attempts to create objects that are
unique--totally different from other objects. For example, a contemporary
fashion designer, Jean-Paul Gaultier, playing the role of avant-garde
innovator recently showed an outfit the front of which was an elegant
Balenciaga-style sculpted white dress while the back was completely bare
except for fishnet hose and a flower.

3. Fashion Design and Avant-gardes in the Age of Postmodernism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, understanding fashion change requires a new
model. Fashion change can no longer be understood entirely as a process
of diffusion from elites to the rest of the population. Instead, in any
particular season, there are numerous styles worn by members of different
age groups and different life styles. Some fashions diffuse downward
from elites and others diffuse upward from denizens of urban minority
ghettos.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Some styles are not diffused at all, but remain in
the enclaves where they originated. Young designers are less concerned
with setting fashion than with establishing a personal style and thereby
achieving visibility in the fashion world. Designers who continue to
extend the tradition of <I>haute couture</I> are disappearing. In this
chaotic environment, it is possible to identify designers whose work is
avant-gardist or postmodernist, though many designers vacillate between
the two.

<P>
One group we may call "the classicists." They represent an older
generation of designers who continue to observe the conventions of
<I>haute couture</I>, making beautiful clothes in the tradition of the
artist-craftsman. On the occasion of the retirement of one of the last
members of this group, Hubert de Givenchy, <I>Le</I> <I>Monde's</I>
fashion 
<b></b>
critic commented: "His collection . . . was a manifesto
of balance, clarity, rigor, the grammar of French taste applied to
couture. . . . Each detail conformed to an absolute order of lines, of
perfect diagonals, of silk jackets that never creased against the body,
but still clung to it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<P>
The approach to fashion design that underlies the tradition of <I>haute
couture</I> is one in which styles and techniques evolve over time, as
exemplified in the work of Balenciaga. According to Milbank, "Balenciaga's
whole work was thematic, each collection growing out of the last; his
collections, in fact, were more intrinsically related than those of
practically any other couturier" (<I>CGD,</I> 320).

<P>
As an example of the nature of his creative style, he invented the
three-quarter sleeve but in the process experimented with numerous
variations: "manche mont&eacute;e non ajust&eacute;e, raglan, pivot,
pingouin, gigot, dolman, chauve-souris."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Similarly, in the
1950s, Dior devised a series of new silhouettes, to which he gave names
taken from the letters of the alphabet: the H line, the A line, the Y
line, and the S line. These lines were created, systematically varying
the basic components of a dress: the width of the shoulders and the
fullness and narrowness of the skirt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>


<P>
A second group of designers might be called "the avant-gardists." For
them, <I>haute couture</I> has functioned analogously to an established
art style, against whose conventions they have rebelled. One of the
first designers in the postwar period to engage in avant-gardism was Paco
Rabanne. Beginning in the 1960s, he created clothes that were so original
that many of them were virtually unwearable. His goal has been to use
materials that have not been considered appropriate for clothing, such
as metals and plastics, which he views as representative of contemporary
life (he believes that cloth will eventually disappear). His self-image is
that of an artist, a sculptor making works that are unique.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

"Real creativity is iconoclastic," he has recently said. "The future
will belong to the person who explodes fashion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 His work is
in many museums, but it is not clear whether it should be classified as
"sculpture," "industrial design," or "fashion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>


<P>
Another means of challenging aesthetic conventions involves the
creation of clothes that express values that are the antithesis of those
expressed in Western clothing generally and in the French tradition of
<I>haute couture</I> specifically. A Japanese designer, Rei Kawakubo,
who is based in Japan but shows her collections semiannually in Paris,
created clothes in the early 1980s that violated major characteristics of
Western clothing as epitomized by <I>haute couture</I>. Western clothes
are expected to be symmetrical. By contrast, symmetry is unimportant in
traditional Japanese clothing and in the work of Kawakubo. For example, a
dress may have three sleeves or one side of a jacket may be longer than
the other. Another characteristic of French <I>haute couture</I> which
Kawakubo's clothes have violated is perfection of craftsmanship; hand
stitching is expected to be perfect, the cut impeccable. Rei Kawakubo
has designed sweaters that are full of holes and dresses with unfinished
ragged hems.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Machines are deliberately manipulated so that
what they produce is flawed (<I>RK,</I> 80).
<b></b>


<P>
Clothes with holes or other imperfections are also viewed as social
statements, as oblique references to the clothes of homeless women and
as veiled attacks on the decadence of western fashion (<I>RK,</I> 80). In
Paris and other fashion capitals, the effect of Kawakubo's clothes in the
early eighties was iconoclastic. According to Sudjic, "Placed against the
background of mainstream fashion of the period . . . Kawakubo's designs
were radically unfamiliar. Indeed some of her garments were interpreted
as an out-and-out assault <I>on the very idea of fashion"</I> (<I>RK,</I>
70, author's italics).

<P>
In the 1990s, young designers like Jean Colonna and Martin Margiela
also produce clothes that deliberately defy the perfect craftsmanship
of <I>haute couture</I>: trousers that are too small, rumpled jackets
and dresses, jackets attached in the middle of the back with a large
safety pin, and jackets with buttons and buttonholes that do not
align.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Even more iconoclastic because it constitutes a threat
to the economic basis of fashion is Margiela's project of creating new
styles from cutup pieces of second-hand garments (<I>SS,</I> 114).

<P>
Subverting the aesthetic conventions of <I>haute couture</I> was also
an objective of the early collections of French designer Jean-Paul
Gaultier. His work was characterized by avant-gardist transformations
of widely accepted values and icons in the <I>haute couture</I>
tradition: using a type of costume associated with one activity for
another very different purpose (an aviator's jacket becomes part of
an evening dress), or taking up details from lingerie (corsets serve
as outerwear). Alternatively, Gaultier took a major icon of <I>haute
couture,</I> the Chanel jacket, and reproduced it in fake fur using as
a belt a chain made for flushing a toilet.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 His objective
was to change the usual meanings attributed to clothes and other objects
that could be appropriated as apparel, such as the jam jar lids that he
used to make bracelets. His philosophy was that, in terms of aesthetic
values, anything was possible and nothing was sacred. In contrast to the
way clothing had been interpreted previously, he showed that the same
piece of clothing could be interpreted in many different ways, depending
upon how and with what it was presented.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Contrary to the
previous norms of fashionable dress, Gaultier argued that being in fashion
depended not so much on <I>what</I> one wore, but <I>how</I> one wore it.

<P>
Some designers, particularly women, have been engaged in subverting social
conventions concerning the way that gender is expressed in clothing. For
example, Kawakubo's designs do not conform to norms concerning the
expression and enhancement of female sexuality in the tradition of
<I>haute couture</I>; her clothes conceal rather than enhance female
sexual attributes. Martin describes her as suppressing sexuality and
sensuality: "Every seduction of flesh is forsaken, every indication of
eros is sublimated."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Kawakubo has explained her point of
view as follows: "We must break away from conventional forms of dress
for the new woman of today. We need a strong new image, not to revisit
the past" (<I>RK,</I> 81).

<P>
Other designers ridicule stereotypical notions of female sexuality by
emphasizing them to an extreme degree. According to Drier, "Parodying the
stereotype, taking it to extremes . . . they begin to open the way--to
humor, to play, potentially to the 
<b></b>
freedom to reconstruct, and thus
redefine the terms of what it means to be a woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>


<P>
Another characteristic of the avant-garde is the attempt to redefine the
social role of the artist and the context in which art is displayed and
distributed. The avant-garde artist assumed the role of rebel or, at the
very least, the role of someone who was sufficiently marginal to be able
to attack social conventions. Some fashion designers express a sense of
personal alienation of a sort that has been traditionally associated with
the avant-garde artist, such as Japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Our work, like all creative activity, ought to rip apart the opaque
curtain of social conventions. We are agitators, and, at the same time, we
have to try to belong to the establishment. This is one of the paradoxical
aspects of our activity. The Americans say to me: "Mr. Yamamoto, you
are not successful." I reply: "Thank you." The notion of success in the
American sense has nothing to do with my work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Finally, some fashion designers have altered the context in which their
work is displayed by showing their collections in locations that lack
the connotations of elegance and wealth that are generally associated
with designer clothing, such as subway stations, supermarkets in poor
neighborhoods, and abandoned housing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The stores where
these clothes are sold are also used to convey statements about the
artistic intentions of the designers. Working closely with architects,
Kawakubo invented decors for her shops that were totally different from
those of traditional shops selling women's clothing or other types of
merchandise for personal consumption. Sudjic reports that her stores
"bore no resemblance to the traditions of shop design as they existed
at that time, no merchandise was visible in the window and little was
on show within the store itself" (<I>RK,</I> 114).

<P>
Frequently imitated in the subsequent decade, her stores have more in
common with the white, pristine spaces of many art galleries devoted
to modern or contemporary art than with traditional department stores
or boutiques. One consequence of the austere and somewhat forbidding
environments in which her clothes were sold was a redefinition of the
traditional clientele for luxury clothes: socialites, actresses, and
businesswomen. As Sudjic points out, "Instead of broadcasting its wares to
passers-by, the store acted as a filter. Its character demanded a certain
confidence from the customer--those who would not feel comfortable with
the clothes would be unlikely to brave the shop" (<I>RK,</I> 114).

<P>
As is the case with many of the avant-garde designers who violate
aesthetic conventions of <I>haute couture</I>, Kawakubo's clientele in
the West consists largely of intellectuals, artists, professionals, and
women who work in the fashion industry. "These," according to Sudjic,
"are clothes that appeal to those who see themselves as outside of the
conventional idea of fashion" (<I>RK,</I> 81).

<P>
A third group of designers might be called "the postmodernists." While
the avant-gardist attempts to be iconoclastic, in however minor a way, the
postmodernist 
<b></b>
prefers to play on ambiguity, creating effects that can
be interpreted in different ways or are difficult to interpret because
they are not intended to express a clear message. A Belgian designer,
Ann Demeulemeester, attempts to create gender ambiguity by blurring
binary categories: "I try always to design a woman who is at the same
time masculine and feminine. . . . A person who would be too masculine
or too feminine would be less appealing to me: a style which favors only
coquettish and very feminine women seems void to me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<P>
Androgyny prevails, luxury is undercut with "street looks," and pastiche
dominates--the continual reshuffling of fragments of preexisting
texts. While in the past designers drew on previous styles to create new
work, today they simply recreate them in order to juxtapose different
periods and ambiences. The difference between these approaches to the past
can be seen in Dior's adaptation of late nineteenth-century style. Rather
than producing a copy, he used elements from the older style to create
what is probably the most famous twentieth-century style, the New Look. By
contrast, a postmodernist, John Galliano, duplicates styles from different
periods and juxtaposes them in the same collection.

<P>
An analogue to the postmodernist project of repudiating the modernist
cult of originality by creating and selling identical copies of famous
paintings (<I>PC,</I> 239) is found in the work of Belgian designer Martin
Margiela, who recently consecrated his collection to the production of
exact copies of collections of clothing that had been created decades
before. What he chose to copy, however, were collections that had
no prestige whatsoever in the tradition of <I>haute couture</I>: the
complete wardrobe of a doll in the sixties, ceremonial robes from the
turn of the century, and black school uniforms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>


<P>
The postmodernist designer also redefines the public's relationship to
fashionable clothes. According to this approach, fashion is an individual
matter; each woman is expected to assemble her own style of dress, one
that is appropriate for her, from a variety of elements, rather than
automatically purchasing and consuming a total look. The fashionable woman
is seen as an individual who does not espouse a single style but uses a
variety of styles in order to express different facets of her personality
or to enable her to participate in a variety of social settings. This
attitude toward the clientele contrasts with that traditionally expressed
in <I>haute</I> <I>couture</I> that the client was expected to be dressed
exclusively by a single couturier, who dictated an entire wardrobe.

<P>
Some designers are identified with both avant-gardist and postmodernist
strategies. A British designer, Vivienne Westwood, who shows her
collections in Paris, exemplifies a postmodernist approach to fashion
design in terms of her emphasis on parody and ambiguity. One example from
a 1990 collection was an outfit entitled "Half-dressed City Gent" which
consisted of a man's large shirt with a loose collar and a tie worn with
pink knickers on which was a graffiti of an enormous penis. An item from
her 1989 collection for men was a pair of tights, intended for women,
with 
<b></b>
a leaf covering the genitals. Worn with traditional male
attire on the feet, the intention was to cultivate doubt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

Is the person male or female?

<P>
Westwood's method of making clothes has been compared with that of a
nineteenth-century avant-garde poet, Arthur Rimbaud. What they have in
common, argues Ash, is a technique of "surmontage" ("PC," 175), the
layering of idea upon idea, "a sort of surmontage of dissimilarities
(cultural and technical) from which comes a new form and from which
emerges a new idea, whether concerning sexuality, dress, cut, history,
painting, music, dance, catwalk performance, philosophy, age, youth, time"
("PC," 165).

<P>
In the mid-1970s Westwood, in collaboration with a music entrepreneur,
created one of the most successful oppositional clothing styles,
punk. Abuse of the body and clothing expressed derisive and nihilistic
attitudes toward establishment values. They used razor-slashed t-shirts,
sewn to simulate scars, t-shirts showing the Queen of England with a
safety pin through her nose and mouth, bondage chains, and hair styles
in garish colors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 In 1975, Westwood's partner organized the
first punk band, the Sex Pistols, comprised of working-class men from the
neighborhood near their clothing store, and dressed them in this style.

<P>
The "punk sensibility" applied to fashion design continued to be
perceived as avant-garde, even in the early 1990s. Counter-cultural
styles, like punk, are able to violate social taboos to a much greater
extent than is possible for designers who have to sell clothes to the
general public, and provide the principal examples of this type of
avant-gardism. In the case of punk, offshoots, such as body piercing,
drag, and sadomasochistic dress, were adopted primarily by the young and
by sexual and racial minorities. Their eventual adoption by mainstream
designers, such as Calvin Klein, signaled the end of their identification
as avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Countercultural styles are frequently copied
by fashion designers, an indication of a postmodernist sensibility, but
the change of context has the effect of negating oppositional elements.

4. Postmodernist and Avant-gardist Themes in Designer Collections
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
An examination of descriptions of French designer collections over a
ten-year period reveals that certain themes have recurred year after
year.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Rather than evolving or progressing, the styles
presented each year by French designers have fluctuated in their relative
emphasis on a set of themes that can be conceptualized in terms of binary
oppositions. Four dominant themes recur: futurity-tradition, masculinity-
femininity, luxury-pauperism, and bodily concealment or nudity. Typically
the avant-garde designer has emphasized the binary pole that appeared to
be the antithesis of luxury fashion, while the postmodernist has engaged
in a strategy of blurring binary opposites.

<P>
Futurity-tradition was one of the most prevalent themes: a postmodernist
blurring of time periods, often with emphasis on nostalgia for the past,
the passage from old to new, past to present, ethnic to contemporary. What
has led to the increasing use 
<b></b>
of intertextuality as an aesthetic
technique is the phenomenon of "semiotic layering" that results from
the constant proliferation and continual redefinition of images in
all the visual media (film, television, advertising, painting, and
fashion). Turim defines it as "the accrual and transformation of meanings
associated with an artifact as it passes through history, or as it is
presented in different versions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Media culture has provided
"visual databanks" that are constantly being redisseminated and make the
past immediately available in a way that was never possible before, a
phenomenon that permits postmodernist designers to play on the multiple
meanings that have become attached to artifacts and styles from the
distant and recent past.

<P>
In the same season, it was typical for designers to revive clothing
styles identified with several different decades of the twentieth
century or historical periods from previous centuries. Others used an
exotic setting from the past, such as Renaissance Venice, as a source of
inspiration. While Wilson has argued that designers were drawing on past
styles long before the period that is generally defined as postmodernist,
referencing the past appears to have escalated and become increasingly
anarchic. Incorporating details from contemporary ethnic cultures is an
equivalent strategy, since ethnic cultures are remnants from earlier
periods; it has provided an additional source of ambiguity based on
cultural fusion. Africa, India, China, and Islam were frequently evoked
in these collections. One designer was described in the following terms:
"In a great melting-pot of motifs and forms, Christian Lacroix pays
homage to all the folklores of the world. His luxurious hippies jump
without transition from a large peasant dress to a knotted outfit with
multi-colored Peruvian stripes and pearled fringes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>


<P>
By contrast, futurity, an attempt to create designs with no references
whatsoever to the past, rarely appeared. Only a Japanese designer based
in Paris, Issey Miyake, produced season after season extraordinary
shapes using materials never before used for clothing. According to one
description, "His clothes, danced rather than worn, seemed to weigh
nothing on the body and adhere to the slightest movement. It is the
effect of a transparent gauze made from a fiber which captures light
and clings gently to the skin."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>


<P>
The theme of sexual ambiguity (masculinity-femininity) also appeared year
after year in many of these collections. Sexual ambiguity was evoked by
juxtaposing items identified with masculine and feminine clothing. In
1991, the Paris collections for summer, 1992, included the following:
men's jackets in dark colors worn over a brassiere or a bustier of
thin strips of plastic; over-sized men's jackets over tops made out
of material that resembled a course fisherman's net; neckties worn
with skirts with seams open to the hip; severe men's jackets worn over
bodysuits in leather.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
Fashion reporters spoke of designers
"playing in depth with masculine-feminine ambiguity" or "playing with the
idea of the masculine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 While in some collections, masculine
and feminine themes were mixed in the same costume, in others, they were
mixed in the collection as a whole: men's jackets, vests, and trousers
alternating with nudity, transparency, and cut-outs. While women have
incorporated elements 
<b></b>
of masculine clothing into their outfits for
centuries, the extent of gender blurring in these collections is peculiar
to the contemporary period.

<P>
The theme of luxury-pauperism entailed elements of avant-garde
subversion and opposition, including the juxtaposition of minimalism
to the perfection of couture clothing, asymmetry to symmetry, and
street fashion to luxury. The simulation of poverty in clothing can be
interpreted as commentary on the excessive luxury of fashion (exemplified
in these collections by the use of expensive materials and embroidery, and
the reappearance of trains with evening dresses). Younger designers were
particularly likely to create clothes that suggested poverty in response
to luxury. Pauperist motifs included partially unraveled sweaters or
sleeves, seams on the outside of clothing, torn materials, and clothing
that was either too large or too small. "Everything is a question of the
means, of details, of the method of treating materials. One tears them,
one crushes them, one burns them. One covers them with 'dirty' marks,
bleaches them or, alternatively adds rich embroidery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>


<P>
One designer's collection was described as "wandering between Sarajevo
and the Salvation Army" while another designer's clothes in the same
season exhibited "exceptional opulence." In one collection, pauperism was
contained in a single detail, an unfinished row of stitches and a piece
of thread dangling on the front of a dress. A subtheme of pauperism was
a concern for ecology, indicated by an emphasis on simple materials such
as raphia and hemp and the use of shells and pebbles for jewelry.

<P>
A fourth theme, concealment-nudity, became increasingly popular
during the decade. Breasts and midriffs were bare or covered with
transparent materials or with crochet or net that revealed as much as
they concealed. In one collection, a bridal costume consisted of nothing
more than a bouquet of flowers and a piece of string. Lingerie such as
brassieres and corsets frequently replaced outerwear.

<P>
The significance of this theme is ambiguous. In the past, female nudity
has generally evoked powerlessness and subordination. However, emphasis
on female nudity in collections by both male and female designers may
reflect changing attitudes toward female sexuality; it can suggest the
idea that women are capable of dominating, rather than being dominated
in, sexual relationships. Pop singer Madonna defends her use of explicitly
pornographic imagery in her videos by claiming that she remains in control
of her image and that she is not a passive sex object.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 In
this sense, emphasis on nudity can be interpreted as an avant-gardist
violation of a bourgeois taboo.

<P>
The overall effect of these collections was one of enormous variety
and apparent change because different elements in the repertoire were
evoked each season. In fact, however, the underlying themes remained very
similar. Each piece of clothing could be deciphered in terms of a complex
set of allusions to the past and to various sexual identities. Some items
of clothing could be interpreted as "assaults" on the entire enterprise of
luxury fashion or as commentaries on bourgeois conceptions of concealment
of the body. At the same time, these collections included other types
of 
<b></b>
avant-gardism (such as jackets that were designed not to be
closed) and numerous examples of surrealism (a hat consisting of a box of
Kleenex worn with a costume constructed of a material that looked and felt
like paper; a "trompe l'oeil" of blue jeans painted on canvas trousers).

<P>

5. Conclusion
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
In the field of poplar culture, postmodernist approaches appear to coexist
uneasily with avant-gardism. Holding the attention of audiences that
are increasingly sophisticated at interpreting complex visual and verbal
imagery requires the use of more varied techniques than were necessary
before the emergence of the electronic media.In fashion design, the
avant-gardist attempts to subvert aesthetic conventions by taking
an oppositional stance, while the postmodernist oscillates between
conventional and unconventional codes, creating effects of polysemy,
ambiguity, and parody. For the avant-gardist, the major technique for
communicating meaning is symbolic subversion; for the postmodernist,
intertextuality. These two tendencies have displaced the classical
approach to fashion design that reworked elements from the past to produce
styles that, while related to the past, were neither copies nor pastiches.

<P>
The oppositional qualities of avant-gardism are muted when juxtaposed
with postmodernism. For the prototypical avant-garde artist of the past,
avant-gardism constituted his or her entire identity: it influenced
not only art works, but social relationships and political views. But
for many practitioners of avant-gardism in popular culture, it is
merely a technique, not an identity, a device that is adopted for a
specific purpose and quickly abandoned. Emphasis on avant-gardism and
postmodernism, in both elite and popular culture, has led to enormous
variety, but not to evolutionary change or coherent messages. In the
deflationary atmosphere of postmodernism, the mystique of the avant-garde
has been submerged--perhaps forever.

The original motivation for this paper was bathetic in the extreme. I
wanted to explain to myself a single small detail in C&eacute;zanne's
late painting of bathers in the National Gallery, London, known as <I>The
Large Bathers,</I> 1894-1905, V.721 (<A HREF="4.3harrison_1.html">
 1</A>): the half-described,
half-connected foot of the re lying on its stomach at the right
that constitutes the nearest object to the picture plane.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

What besets me, like many other spectators no doubt, is the sheer
incorrigibility of its awkwardness. I have tried, as I imagine
C&eacute;zanne must have done, and I have looked at this painting over
and over again, but each time it's the same. I pull on this loose end,
meaning to tidy things up a bit, and there's that dreadful sinking
feeling as the whole painting starts to unravel in my hands. This time
perhaps it will be different. I will try to be more careful.



<P>
I open this paper, therefore, with two interrelated conjectures. I claim
no originality for either of them. If this paper has a contribution
to make it is simply in putting them to work in tandem on the art
of C&eacute;zanne. I shall not attempt to argue for the conjectures
themselves. I shall assume that their power to focus attention on some
aesthetic properties of C&eacute;zanne's paintings may be taken as a
relevant test of their validity.

<P>
The first conjecture goes like this. As regards the first phase of what
we have come to think of as modernism in its artistic form, say from the
early 1860s onward for about fifty years, the problem of how women look
may be thought of as a significant factor driving change in painting. I
do not mean to suggest that the only paintings that matter are those that
represent women as being looked at, or that represent women looking,
or that represent women looking self-conscious as a result of being
looked at, though it is certainly true that a highly informative--and
no doubt controversial--exhibition could be constructed along such
lines. My contention is rather that a problem-ridden involvement with the
representation of women may be connected at some level to those changes
in the conceptualization of the painted surface that we have learned to
identify with modernism. Foremost among these are changes in the character
and functions of re-ground effects. These changes are telling, for

<b></b>
the effects in question are the principal means by which objects
of attention are represented as such within pictorial contexts. They are
crucial deciders of significance in painting. The important point, then,
is this: though these changes may be most easily explained by reference
to pictures of women, and though they may have been first practiced in
such pictures, once initiated and seen at work they have consequences
that are determining upon conditions of aesthetic success and failure
in paintings other than those in which women are pictured. Another
way to put this would be to say that implementation of the changes in
question becomes a condition of modernism in painting generally. And as
these consequences are confronted in landscape and still life, feedback
from work in these other genres comes in turn to change the perceived
character of the problem field, though the problem itself does not cease
to be besetting. It is a symptom of this state of affairs, clear from the
work of Manet, of Degas and of C&eacute;zanne himself, that the genre of
the nude offers no secure refuge from the modern problems of picturing
women. On the contrary, as the decorum of the classical breaks down,
the unclothed woman returns disturbingly to the present.

I'll try to clarify these points by means of a familiar comparison. The
res in Bouguereau's <I>Bathers</I> (Art Institute of Chicago) stand
out clearly against the depth of the pictorial ground on which the
painter locates them (<A HREF="4.3harrison_2.html">
 2</A>). Much of the painting's effect depends
upon the isolated solidity of these res in their contrast with the
surrounding illusory space. In endowing his women with the appearance
of self-consciousness, Bouguereau evokes a form of modernity. Yet in so
far as their plastic isolation renders this self-consciousness merely
anecdotal, the painting's modernity is spurious. In contemporary works
by C&eacute;zanne, on the other hand, the bathers appear molded from the
same substance as their pictorial surroundings. (See, for instance, the
<I>Three Bathers,</I> circa 1880, V.381, formerly owned by Matisse, now
in the Petit Palais, Paris [<A HREF="4.3harrison_3.html">
 3</A>].) The effect is of one differentiated
surface from which 
<b></b>
the res of the women are made to emerge. The
"impressionist" technique by means of which C&eacute;zanne came to
achieve this effect was largely practiced in work on landscape, where
the pursuit of a unified pictorial atmosphere encouraged the distribution
of re-ground effects evenly across the canvas. One function of this
technique was to rule out just the kind of anecdotal introversion that
Bouguereau offered.

<P>
This is not to say, however, that that technique solved either the
problems of picturing women or the problems of painting nudes. We may
sketch out an art-historical context by thinking of C&eacute;zanne's
early bathers as kinds of hybrid: res taken from Courbet, painted in a
technique taken from Monet. But in the end impressionist technique acted
as a limit on the possibility of work in the higher genres. So long as
C&eacute;zanne had such work in mind the problem of psychological states
being attached to pictured women was one that would stalk his endeavor.

<P>
Let me make clear how I do not intend to put this first conjecture
to work. I will not be presenting an argument about the sublimation
of C&eacute;zanne's unsatisfactory relations with women into the
genres of still life and landscape. My aim is rather to consider the
mechanisms generating critical feedback in the painter's practice--the
forms of potential and prohibition by which aesthetic production is in
general directed. I am interested in what might be thought of as the
aesthetic parameters of modern painting and how these parameters are
set. My procedure will be not to demonstrate the power of psychology or
biography to generate readings of pictures, but rather to consider the
larger psychological history that can be learned from art's aesthetic
properties. In the spirit of this priority I might rephrase the first
conjecture in the following terms: if the evidence of painting is
anything to go by--the evidence, that's to say, of what it took to make a
painting aesthetically modern--then there must have been powerful material
conditions at work between the middle of the nineteenth century and the
outbreak of the First World War, such that the autonomy of women--the
lack of it or the potential for it--was a highly vexed issue. Which of
course it was.

<P>
The second conjecture concerns the relationship, or rather a possible
distinction, between fantasy and imagination. Though these terms tend to
be conflated in the casual usage of our culture, there are languages,
including German, in which the differentiation is not really on offer
in the first place--or not, at least, as a division within the same
geography of concepts. The contrast I propose may therefore be thought
of as specific and strategic to the purposes of this paper.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

I draw some support, however, from the distinction between imagination
and fancy noticed by Baudelaire in his essay on the Salon of 1859
(by reference to the writing of Mrs. Crowe), and from the concerns
expressed by the naturalist Castagnary in 1874, to the effect that the
invention of such subjective fantasies as C&eacute;zanne's was a symptom
of the impoverishment of imagination.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 What I have in mind in
speaking of imagination is a faculty conceived of as realistic as well
as creative, or rather, realistic as a necessary condition of being
creative. Imagination is the means by which we extend competence in

<b></b>
thought. It serves in the solution of problems, in the formation
of theories, in the understanding of other people's behavior, and in
the regulation of our own, in so far as we give thought to the effects
of our actions. Imagination is suited to these ends because it is always
subservient to some object of thought, even if that object has yet to be
brought to coherent form. Imaginative inquiries are ethically constrained,
however little they may comport with any established moral decorum. The
realism of imagination is assured when envisaged effects and consequences
are those that might follow naturalistically upon envisaged causes
and actions. Where there are no such necessary entailments, however,
speculative mental activity may be thought of as fantasy. Fantasy comes
as it were whole, accompanied by (typically spurious) claims for its
own authenticity. In that sense it is undiscursive. To the extent that
fantasy involves the prising apart of cause and effect, it entails
the circumvention of imagination. In the world of fantasy, actions
are not constrained by naturalistic or social consequences, power and
desire are inexhaustible, everything is consumable, and nothing is in
practice produced. That it requires little exercise of imagination to
raise objections to such a world serves to indicate the grounds on which
imagination and fantasy might be said to diverge.

<P>
Now I suspect that some distinction between these two aspects of mental
activity is in practice crucial to pictures. The issue is complicated by
the fact that it is often by recourse to the very materials of fantasy
that imagination does its most fruitful pictorial work. Imagination that
shrinks from fantasy tends to be lacking in vividness. That very shrinking
is a warning that distinctions between fantasy and imagination will not
necessarily direct us to the building blocks of realism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

As regards the early processes of the production of a work of art, too
ready a distinction would be inhibiting to practice and priggish in
criticism. But where the distinction becomes of crucial importance is
in the tuning of pictorial composition and effects. In other words,
it was--and still may be--a condition of aesthetic adequacy in the
production of these effects that they be addressed to a critically active
and possibly skeptical regard. My second conjecture, then, is that some
critical distinction that corresponds to one between imagination and
fantasy was central to the development of those pictorial effects by
which modern painting itself came to be distinguished. (I am confident,
at least, that it was crucial to the terms in which a modern painting
distinguished itself ethically from the academy and from the standard
fare of the Salon in France during the third quarter of the nineteenth
century. It could be argued that the distinction has no specific bearing
in a postmodern culture. Throwing caution to the winds, however, one
might say: so much the worse for postmodern culture.)

<P>
I need now to put the two conjectures together. Comparisons staged
with the benefit of hindsight will help to make the point. In the
most well-thumbed of these comparisons it seems appropriate enough to
speak of the critical modern revision of a conservative compositional
type. The transparency of Cabanel's <I>Birth of Venus</I> of 1863
(first shown at the Salon of 1863, now at the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay,
Paris) seems deliberately countered by the opacity of Manet's <I>A Modern
Olympia</I> of the same year 
<b></b>
(first shown at the Salon of 1865, now
also at the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay). The one appears as an invitation to
unselfconscious absorption in the deep space and uncomplex re-ground
effects of fantasy; the other as an admonition to spectators to remain
firmly on this side of the painted surface, where we must reflect to
the best of our imaginative capacity upon the circumstance the picture
defines for us within the limits of its framing edge. With the Manet we
are in the fertile neighborhood of Richard Wollheim's "spectator in the
picture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 One point to note is that the more conservative
version of a pictorial type may well be the one that comes later. The
composition of a painting can be made to instruct or to demand the
exercise of imagination, or it can be made to occasion the elaboration
of fantasy. Often enough the imaginative representation of modernity
reappears as the stuff of conservative fantasy, though of course it
undergoes a transformation in the process. It should not surprise
us that this transformation is typically effected as a shift in the
class-identification the picture proposes for its spectator. Technically,
the shift back to more reassuringly stable relations tends to be
implemented, as we would expect, by reimposing clear-cut re-ground
relations upon the composition in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 What this suggests
is that the distinction between imagination and fantasy is highly
contingent with respect both to the social worlds from which pictures
come and to the technical conditions under which paintings are made.

<P>
What we can say, with some confidence, is that the topical significance of
our distinction is evident in a range of paintings produced between the
1860s and the 1890s, in each of which the represented self-consciousness
of a pictured woman acts to motivate an imaginative self-consciousness on
the part of the spectator. The reference to self-consciousness, however,
makes clear that the distinction between the modern and the conservative
is not to be captured simply by talking about perceived differences
in the women in question. What we might look to, then, are the means
employed in the modern painting to render its re-ground relations
problematic for the responding spectator. One telling sign lies in the
animation of the modern painting's "back space," a term I owe to the
film theorist Yuri Tsivian.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In Tsivian's account certain
film-makers in pre-revolutionary Russia distinguished their work from
theater and opera by connecting it explicitly to the art of painting. This
was how they signalled the medium specificity and the modernism of their
work. And one device they used to explore this connection was to shoot
into mirrors. The consequence for film as for painting was to reflect a
world on this side of the screen or picture plane, a world in which the
spectator is physically, socially, and psychologically implicated--or,
in Michael Fried's sense, present.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>


<P>
I can put the issue very simply. One way to distinguish not only a modern
re painting, but a modern still life or even a modern landscape,
is first to ask, "Who is looking at this picture?" and then to ask
whether or not the question is relevant. My sense of relevance here
is thoroughly Greenbergian. I mean, "Is the asking of this question
relevant to the quality of the painting's effects?" where effects are
understood not simply in terms of responses to the "thing imaged," but
as critical functions of technique and composition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 There is
an important caution to apply here. In cases 
<b></b>
where we agree that
the question of who is looking is a relevant one to ask, it will not
necessarily be because we have a specific answer in mind. If we feel in
front of a given painting that it testifies vividly to a specific and
discriminate form of regard, we should not deny this intuition simply
because the regard in question is one we are unable to attribute. At
the start of things we may be at a loss to know where--or how--to look.

<P>
I think these matters have a particular pertinence where C&eacute;zanne
is concerned. This is to say that the kinds of self-critical feedback we
should expect to observe if the conjectures are justified are consistent
with those to which his work may be seen as responding. Let's deal with
simple matters first. That C&eacute;zanne's pictures of women tend to be
troubled and troubling is one of the most secure among the various truisms
that circulate about his work. There is the beguilingly explicit testimony
of a few early subject pictures. (See, for instance, <I>The Murder,</I>
circa 1867-1868, V.121, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; the earlier
version of the <I>Temptation of St. Anthony,</I> circa 1870, V.123,
in the B&uuml;hrle collection, Zurich; and the <I>Strangled Woman,</I>
circa 1870-1872, formerly Kaganovitch collection, now Mus&eacute;e
d'Orsay.) More to the point, however, is the evidence of over three
hundred works devoted to the theme of bathers in landscape settings. As
was made clear in the exhibition of these held in Basle a few years ago
(<I>Die Badenden/Les Baigneuses/The Bathers,</I> Kunstmuseum, 10 September
to 10 December 1989), the problems of representing the female nude were
central to the development of C&eacute;zanne's work over a period of some
forty years--a period coincident with that specific phase of modernism
during which I've proposed that that problem was in general determining
technical change.

<P>
Now it seems clear that the aesthetic consequences of those problems were
aggravated from the start by the distinctive nature of C&eacute;zanne's
interest in and ambitions for the subject matter of his pictures. These
were such that a critical distinction between fantasy and imagination
was particularly hard to sustain in his work. For his contemporaries
among the future impressionists in the later 1860s and early 1870s, a
modern composition was paradigmatically something to which the predicates
of realism or naturalism might be attached; it was to be derived, in
other words, from the imaginative encounter with a modern world. But
C&eacute;zanne's ambition was both larger and less sophisticated--or
less sophisticated in so far as it was larger. The res in his early
paintings are players in fictional dramas derived from his reading, from
his viewing of the painting of the Venetians, of Rubens and of Delacroix,
and, it would seem, from powerful forms of fantasy, for which both his
reading and his viewing provided an iconography. Well into his thirties,
C&eacute;zanne was producing pictures marked by that mixture of the
authentic and the embarrassing that we tend to see as characterizing
the self-assertive culture of the modern adolescent, while much of
the rative material he assembled during this early phase remains
genetically present to the end of his life. The extended re whose
foot so troubles me, for instance, can be traced back from the early
1900s through various compositions and changes of gender, to a strange
and evocative watercolor of a diver in moonlight, probably dating from
the late 1860s (National Museum of Wales, Cardiff, RWC.29).

SRC="button/4.3harrison_4b.gif"></A>

There is no clearer demonstration of C&eacute;zanne's late-adolescent
processes of derivation and self-assertion than the extraordinary painting
known as <I>Le festin</I> or <I>The Orgy,</I> assigned in the catalogue of
the recent exhibition to the period 1867-1872 (private collection,
V.93 [<A HREF="4.3harrison_4.html">
 4</A>]). What should we make of an upended tableau of writhing
bodies and body-like forms that is anchored at its rative point of
entry by a gaping orifice? The indispensable function of this component is
emphasized in the painting by its relative proximity and projection. It
is made even clearer in a study now in a private collection in Stuttgart
(RWC.23). The study also serves to point the aporesis involved. How should
we read this insistently installed device? As the point of generation
of the picture's fantasmic depth or as an invitation to the violation
of its surface?
<b></b>


<P>
It is not my intention to explore further C&eacute;zanne's sexual
psychology. I simply mean to observe the problems that must have attached
to his motivation and his ambition with respect to the higher genres:
problems in reconciling the assertive temperament of his work with the
aesthetic parameters of the modern. By the late 1860s these parameters
were such that certain dangers attended upon the reinvention of baroque
and romantic compositions--dangers that had not accompanied their original
formulation. For instance, an honest account of Delacroix's <I>Death of
Sardanapalus</I> (Louvre, Paris) would acknowledge that the painting's
aesthetic standing is not actually put at risk by the phantasmagoric
character of its theme. On the other hand, to reengage with such material
in the 1860s and 1870s was to make it resonate through very different
social and psychological spaces. In fact, what we may suppose to have been
the determinants on C&eacute;zanne's sexual psychology were presumably
not of themselves that unusual for the time. What was distinctive was
the force and persistence with which the materials of fantasy appear
to have invaded his practice. Bearing our initial conjectures in mind,
we can note two relevant conditions. The first is that by the 1860s,
let alone the 1870s, this invasion was potentially ruinous to a painter
concerned to identify himself with the modern. The second is that this
circumstance was in large part a consequence of those aesthetic problems
that had come to cluster around the representation of women specifically
and of nudes in general, problems that impressionism could evade only
in so far as it circumvented the higher genres.

<P>
C&eacute;zanne presumably had to learn the hard way just how the
conditions in question were bearing down upon his art. The gravity of
the resulting conflict is clearly demonstrated by the lengths to which he
was driven in his attempts to counter the effects of fantasy. To get the
measure of what must have been at stake, we have only to consider how such
a picture as <I>Le festin</I> might have appeared had the unalleviated
canons of naturalism been conscripted in its realization. Instead,
however, a self-critical imagination has been brought into play. The
stilting up of the pictorial space, the apparent distortion of the
res, and the desperate but colorful laboring of the surface are all
expedients required by the exercise of taste, a taste formed in part by
Delacroix and Veronese and, ironically enough, educated in the direct
confrontation with their work in Paris. (It has been proposed that
the painting was reworked in the light of C&eacute;zanne's first-hand
experience in the Louvre.) My suggestion is that the development of
self-consciousness regarding the effects at stake in his early subject
pictures was a crucial factor in the maturing of C&eacute;zanne's
style. It is a sign of this process of maturation that whatever might be
achieved by the overly emphatic modelling, it must not deliver a coherent
and readable system of re-ground relations. Not long after this he was
writing to his mother about the need to keep finish at bay.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

No wonder. In face of the artist's embarrassment and desperation it turns
out that it is we who are in moral jeopardy: caught up in the bad taste
of our own technical voyeurism.

I now return to the question of who is looking at the modern picture--or
rather to the point about the relevance to the modern picture of
the question's being asked. It is in Manet's work that the asking
of the question is made an indispensable condition
<b></b>
 of response
to painting's modernity. Richard Wollheim has shown how consistently
Manet rehearses us in the imaginative roles pictures may propose for
their spectators. In this connection, there are two points to be made
regarding the work of C&eacute;zanne. The first concerns his own response
to Manet's work. According to Joachim Gasquet, in later life he recalled
<I>A Modern Olympia</I> as the initiator of a "new order of painting,"
and as marking the beginning of "our Renaissance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Whether
or not Gasquet's testimony is reliable, it is clear both that Manet's
work was crucial for C&eacute;zanne, and that he responded strongly
to its distinctive implication of the spectator. What is particularly
noteworthy for our purposes is the practical conclusion he seems to have
drawn. To the question, "Who is implicated?" or "Who is looking?" his
response was unequivocal. The answer was, "I am." He made the point
quite explicitly, of course, in the two versions of his own <I>Modern
Olympia,</I> circa 1870-1873. (What appears to be the earlier of the
two, V.106, also known as <I>The Pasha,</I> is in a private collection
[see <A HREF="4.3harrison_5.html">
 5</A>]; the second, V.225, is in the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay.) To
exploit Tsivian's analogy, the effect is as if a film camera had been
able to withdraw into the back space of its own projected image, so as
to include the spectator within the world of the film itself. And the
spectator C&eacute;zanne thus discovers is not just the expected bourgeois
client, but himself. In the paintings that may be connected to Manet's
<I>D&eacute;jeuner sur l'Herbe,</I> like his own <I>D&eacute;jeuner,</I>
circa 1870-1871 (private collection, V.107), and the work known as
<I>Pastorale</I> or <I>Idyll,</I> circa 1870 (Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, V.104
[<A HREF="4.3harrison_6.html">
 6</A>]), he inserts a self-conscious pictorial token of himself, both as
spectator and as apparent protagonist. In these awkward paintings, it is
as if the pictured
<b></b>
 re within the composition were made the point
of origin of all that is seen by the composition's external spectator.

<P>
The point I am trying to get to is this. C&eacute;zanne's response to
the modern painting of the 1860s was thoroughly apt, but at the same time
highly idiosyncratic. In reworking Manet's themes in the early 1870s he
seems to have grasped the full significance of the imagined spectator,
yet he identified this spectator consistently and wholly with himself, to
the exclusion of others who might be imagined as "equivalent." There is no
other "spectator in the picture" in C&eacute;zanne's work. Not ever. The
motivation for this identification must surely have been complex. One
factor may have been the need of the Proven&ccedil;al for a form of
self-assertive presence at the center of his painting's culture. There is
a kind of desperate gawkiness in his vaunted modernization of Manet. But
what is most tellingly revealed is that C&eacute;zanne understood or
stumbled on the contradictory aesthetic obligation that modern art would
from now on have to assume. If it is the case that a modern composition
is one that presupposes a specific form of answering regard, then the
obligation on an assiduous practice will be to imagine that regard in its
most critically demanding form. But the act of imagination is one for
which the 
<b></b>
work itself provides the occasion. It is not only that
C&eacute;zanne inserts a rative token of himself into any subject
painting where the presence of an external spectator might otherwise
be presumed. In later works, even in his still lifes, there is almost
always some trace of his factitious activity that remains unassimilated
into the pictorial mimesis, as if to declare the painter's inescapable
responsibility for what is seen. To call such paintings unfinished
seems inadequate to the point of falsehood. It is as if the conditions
of realism now had to be worked for with the materials of a solipsistic
practice.

<P>
Let me be clear here. I am not saying that C&eacute;zanne responded to
all he saw with a kind of palpitating subjectivity--as if to assume that
whatever a picture was for him were what it was. Such a habit would have
earned him the title Head of Department in a 1950s art college. No, what
seems so besetting about C&eacute;zanne's responses--to the work of other
artists, to nature, and of course primordially to his own painting--is the
sense they convey of his being absolutely implicated in, and by, what he
was looking at; of his being responsible for it, or sometimes guilty of
it. For most of this century we have been busy recovering C&eacute;zanne's
humanity and rationality from the jibes of his detractors. Perhaps
it is finally time to restore some sense of his strangeness and his
extremism. To an extent unparalleled among the artists of the time, and
to the end of his career, he was to represent himself both as the point of
origin of the visible world and as the arbiter of its representation. For
Manet, for Renoir, for Degas, the possibility of wearing a mask was
a necessary condition of the invention of a subject. For Pissarro, for
Monet, and for Sisley, at least as they presented themselves, an apparent
distaste for the wearing of masks required that they abstain from the
invention of subjects. But C&eacute;zanne would neither wear a mask nor
abstain from invention. He would be both the discoverer and the inventor
of what he saw; or, to borrow terms from the work of Richard Shiff, he
would both find his motifs and make them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P>
This may help us to explain why the theme of bathers remained central to
the problem-field of C&eacute;zanne's art. It may also serve to restore
some sense of his real proximity to those generally unregarded artists
who invent incompetently because they cannot competently depict. Monet's
"dream of bathing at La Grenouill&egrave;re" was a project for a
modern-life picture, for which sketches could at least be made in an
actually populated area.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 C&eacute;zanne's project submitted
to the demands of naturalism to this extent: the negative of his ambition
was the debased neoclassicism of the Salon, in which clear-cut res,
posed and studied in a studio light, would be collaged onto a plein-air
backdrop. The possibility of technical consistency was thus crucial for
C&eacute;zanne as it was for Monet. But there was no question of his
achieving this by posing a handful of nudes in the country, even had he
been temperamentally capable or technically equipped. The sensation of
the natural must be achieved, then, with materials that were invented,
invented and combined, then reinvented and recombined, materials that
must always, in the process, be regarded with a critical eye lest their
origination in fantasy compromise the integrity of the painting.
<b></b>


<P>
This identification of origination with critical responsibility and
guilt was to direct C&eacute;zanne's practice to the end. That he found
it supported at various times by various forms of theory--theories
of optics, color, sensation, intelligence--tells us less about the
validity of these theories themselves than about his continuing need
for confirmation. We have become accustomed to the mythology of the
painter as at once origin and arbiter, and we forget the extent to
which the myth was generated around the re of C&eacute;zanne. It
is thus easy to ignore the individuality and the strangeness of this
act of identification. Yet there is no other oeuvre in which it is so
consistently and unremittingly made, or which has so persistently driven
popular expectations concerning an artist's field of action. What must
it have been like to be engaged on such an enterprise?

<P>
I conceive of two complementary aspects that we distinguish
for clarity's sake, but that must have been indistinguishable in
practice. Firstly, C&eacute;zanne must have felt it necessary to maintain
a constant vigilance with regard to that which he found aesthetically
inauthentic. Where the inauthentic was discovered outside his own practice
he would be driven to oppose it with the values of his own work. He
remained obsessed by Bouguereau's turpitude, as if the plasticity and
detachment of the other artist's bathers were an offense to be eradicated
through the optical coherence and integration of his own. But of course
the more persistent problems would be those that involved elimination of
the inauthentic from his own work. It would appear inauthentic when he did
not like it. Or, to put it the other way round, it would be inauthentic
when it did not answer to him as its spectator; when it did not meet
the most assiduously critical regard he could bring to bear upon it;
when it appeared disharmonious. Whatever his mature style had not yet
encompassed, whatever he thus felt to be still alienated from himself,
whether in a study of bathers, in the arrangement of a still life, or
in a view of the Mont Sainte-Victoire, would have to be brought somehow
into a harmony, or left provisional and unresolved. In fact, hard as
it sometimes is to resist the sense of an achieved completeness, this
harmony was always unreachable. Given C&eacute;zanne's strange extremism,
how could it have been anything else? The implication is that if there
is now any unbureaucratized life left in his work, it will be in its
provisional and unresolved properties that it will be found.

<P>
I proposed two aspects to his enterprise. The second would be the
process of gradual identification with the emerging work, so poignantly
represented in the gesture of enfolding that Gasquet reports.

were interlocked.) That's what one needs to achieve . . . If one hand

It is in the attempt practically to imagine this process that the language
of criticism consistently falters. I find myself back again with that
half-attached foot and the painting coming apart in my hands. But
perhaps that is precisely the point. For what first and foremost
distinguishes the detail I'm referring to is its function as a point
of demarcation. It is not quite a point of entry to the imaginative
depth of the picture, nor quite reducible to a literal component of
its surface. I now think of it as marking a kind of limit: a limit to
the absoluteness of C&eacute;zanne's responsibility for what he made
and to the possibility of his identification with it. The way in which
this limit functions seems to me consistent with the conjectures with
which I began. That is to say it serves to demarcate the operations of
the imagination from those of fantasy and to do so in a manner pertinent
to the experience of self-consciousness as gendered. Of all things, the
misshapen foot appears as a guarantee that C&eacute;zanne has not relaxed
his vigilant taste--that unsparing discipline that allowed a measure of
dangerous adolescent romanticism to survive to the end of his life.

Of course, these points may be made with some confidence in face of a
work so labored with female bodies. Yet, as I have suggested, it is also
true that in a very large number of his mature works the painter's touch
appears to hesitate just where it comes 
<b></b>
to defining that which
is nearest to the eye, or apparently most ready to the hand. I think
particularly of the <I>Still Life with Curtain and Flowered Pitcher,</I>
circa 1899 (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, V.731 [<A HREF="4.3harrison_7.html">
 7</A>]), with its
lightly sketched bottom corner, and the <I>Curtain, Jug and Compotier,</I>
circa 1893-1894 (<A HREF="4.3harrison_8.html">
 8</A>), one of the most moving of all the works
in the recent exhibition, where an apparent tentativeness in definition
of the lower center serves to keep the whole composition open (Mrs. John
Hay Witney collection, formerly Barnes Foundation, V.601, also known as
<I>Still Life with Apples, Pears and a Grey Jug</I>). What can we imagine,
it seems to ask, and on what basis? Is it possible to construct a harmony
in which there are nevertheless fully recognized individuals? In having
the painting propose this question it might seem that I am reading
it as a prophetic allegory of our late-twentieth-century political
concerns. Yet I suspect that at the level of the imaginative, the social
and the psychological are not significantly distinguished. All we can
securely say is that the painting testifies to the operation of a still
relevant if unfashionable set of aesthetic parameters.

By contrast a certain animation seems to be missing from those few late
works, like the <I>Kitchen Table,</I> circa 1890 (<A HREF="4.3harrison_9.html">
 9</A>), in which
C&eacute;zanne achieved a consistent touch across the entire surface

<b></b>
(Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, V.594). In the end it seems that the limit
is aesthetically indispensable. There must be something to keep the work
of art provisional, contingent, and practical--something to keep the
primordial spectator out, and to recall him to self-consciousness. Where
the limit is not set there is a danger that fantasy will reign without
constraint, and that a picture may then indeed become a world or a body
to be entered.

In its original form, this paper was given as a contribution to a
symposium on "C&eacute;zanne and the Aesthetic," held at the National
Gallery, London, in March 1996, in connection with the exhibition
<I>C&eacute;zanne,</I> then at the Tate Gallery. The exhibition was
shown previously at the Galleries Nationales du Grand Palais, Paris,
and subsequently at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The paper is
informed by the work of three other speakers at the symposium: by
Richard Wolheim's theorization of "the spectator in the picture" in
his <I>Painting as an Art</I> (Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1987); by T. J. Clark's work on the modernity of Manet's <I>Olympia</I>
and <I>Bar at the Folies-Berg&egrave;re</I> in his <I>Painting of Modern
Life</I> (Princeton: princeton University Press, 1984); and by Richard

I am aware that my title may have invoked some expectations of a grasp
of psychoanalytical theory to which I have no right or intention to lay
claim. What primarily interests me is the art-historical significance
of the terms in question. However, I do not mean entirely to disregard
the distinctions between imagination and fantasy (or phantasy) made in
standard forms of psychoanalytical theory. Laplanche and Pontalis, for
example, gloss the notion of fantasy thus: "Imaginary scene in which the
subject is a protagonist, representing the fulfillment of a wish (in the
last analysis, an unconscious wish) in a manner that is distorted to a
greater or lesser extent by defensive processes. Phantasy has a number of
different modes: conscious phantasies or daydreams, unconscious phantasies
like those uncovered by analysis as the structures underlying a manifest
content, and primal phantasies" (Jean Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis,

The relevant points may be demonstrated by comparing Degas's <I>Au

(Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay) with Fernand Lungren's <I>The Caf&eacute;</I> of
1890 (Art Institute of Chicago). The compositional devices, re-ground
effects, and shifts of focus in Degas's painting serve to position an
imaginary spectator within the same physical, social, and psychological
space as the pictured woman, and thus to set up a potential anomaly
between that spectator's actual and imaginary identities. In Lungren's
clearly related work, the conventional compositional scheme, marked
re-ground distinctions, and uniform sharpness of focus serve to
reinstall a type of viewer whose take upon the prospect in view is
psychologically and ideologically standard.

Though little remarked since its occurrence, an event that took place
on 7 October 1915 in New York city bears considerable significance for
our understanding of the rapport between the historical avant-garde and
modern commodity culture. On that day the Modern Gallery, located at 500
Fifth Avenue, opened its doors for its first exhibition. Created by Marius
de Zayas, Francis Picabia, Agnes Ernst Meyer, and other young members of
Alfred Stieglitz's 291 entourage, the Modern Gallery was conceived of as
the commercial "expression" of the famous "spirit of 291." That firmly
avant-garde res such as de Zayas and Picabia would feel Stieglitz's
pioneering modern art venue required an openly commercial off-shoot may
seem strange, since current consensus tells us that such artists ought
to have sardonically opposed the commodification of the art object, or at
least been highly ambivalent on the subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 But of course the
strangeness of this development is precisely why it is worth recounting
and analyzing. The story of how the commercial Modern Gallery emerged
out of the declining anti-commercialism of Stieglitz's Little Galleries
of the Photo Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue offers key insights into the
surprisingly optimistic nature of the avant-garde's engagement with the
modern fact of commodification and the powerful attraction exerted by
machine-age American commodity culture on the aesthetic and institutional
imaginations of both European and American avant-garde artists of the
time. The fact of this attraction to commodity culture puts into question
the widely held belief that the historical avant-garde sought to change
"life" through "art": in New York, avant-garde artists sought artistic
direction 
<b></b>
from the machine-age life around them, so that "art"
was shaped by "life"--both in aesthetics and its institutional arenas;
for res such as de Zayas and Picabia, the primary motivation behind
the artistic and institutional work of the New York avant-garde was the
desire to be absolutely contemporary with, rather than in opposition
to, modern society as emblematized by New York's commodity culture.

<P>
The Modern Gallery opened within the context of Alfred Stieglitz's
decline as pioneering avant-garde impresario and institution builder
and the contemporaneous expansion of the market for modernist art in
New York. Stieglitz's magazine <I>Camera Work</I> and his 291 gallery
came to an end in the summer of 1917 after a steady decline in activity
that began just after the 1913 International Exhibition of Modern
Art, known as the Armory Show. Though scholars have offered numerous
reasons for this decline, the primary one is the failure of Stieglitz's
long-standing anti-commercial strategy for coping with post-Armory Show
modernist art market expansion. That strategy was now replaced by another
advanced by the de Zayas-Picabia group, one much better adapted to the
post-Armory Show atmosphere because of its optimistic belief that art's
commodification could afford the avant-garde the opportunity to "pay its
own way" as a contemporary expression of the energies animating modern
American society.

<P>
<I>Camera Work</I>, originally a quarterly, appeared sporadically after
the Armory show until, from the summer of 1914 to its final number in
June 1917, only three slim issues appeared. When it ceased publication it
had only thirty-eight subscribers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 During this same period,
Stieglitz became far less active in his pursuit of significant new
artists for exhibition at 291. Showings centered primarily on works by
artists already familiar to the 291 public, such as John Marin, Marsden
Hartley, and Abraham Walkowitz; significant ground-breaking exhibitions
at 291 were organized not by Stieglitz but by the younger de Zayas. (De
Zayas was a Mexican-American caricaturist and collector who established
contacts between 291 and members of the Parisian avant-garde, particularly
those associated with Guillaume Apollinaire's review <I>Les Soir&eacute;es
de Paris;</I> his expositions at 291 included the "African Savage Art"
show of 1914 and the U.S. debut of Italian Futurist Gino Severini in
1917.) Even the two notable debuts that Stieglitz himself arranged--the
1916 debut of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the photographer Paul Strand,
and Georgia O'Keefe's debut the following year--testify to a turn in
the period following the Armory Show from his previous emphasis on both
American and European modern art to a nativist focus on American art
alone, especially American art originating within the 291 circle.

<P>
Stieglitz scholars have typically explained this decline in activity
by refering to developments in his personal life: in 1917 Steiglitz
was fifty-three, in serious debt, and tired from fourteen years of
publishing <I>Camera Work</I> and nine years of operating 291 (<I>SMB,</I>
127). While these no doubt contributed to Stieglitz's withdrawal, the
primary reason for his retreat from his position as New York's foremost
champion of the international avant-garde was the awkward double bind in
which he found himself after the Armory Show. While the show confirmed
his visionary, truly avant-garde 
<b></b>
stature as a crusader for modern
art, its popularization of that art paradoxically ensured that his
vision was no longer unique. As William I. Homer notes, between 1913
and 1917, "291 [came to be] rivaled by the Daniel, Carroll, Washington
Square (later Coady), Montross, and Bourgeois galleries, along with The
Modern Gallery." Further, several clubs and exhibition societies put on
important exhibits in these years, while avant-garde journals such as
<I>The Seven Arts</I> and <I>The Soil</I> came to occupy territory that
had previously been <I>Camera Work</I>'s exclusive domain.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

Stieglitz, despite the expansion of the New York modern art scene,
failed to gain new subscribers to the journal or substantially increase
attendance at 291.

<P>
Why did Stieglitz interpret the evident success of his vision as a
loss of uniqueness, and what relation did this have to his inability
to attract more attention? The question is important. Stieglitz, after
all, might have viewed this loss of exclusivity as the affirmation of
his originality. But in his view the expanding popularity of modernist
art was driven by fashion on the mass level and investment strategies
at the level of collecting and dealing. It betrayed the "spirit of
291." Stieglitz wanted people to admire the work "in terms of spiritual
force, not as a material commodity," and at times he would complain,
"Work isn't art until enough noise is made about it, until someone rich
comes along and buys it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 His legendary anti-commercialism,
often portrayed as eccentric or amusing before the Armory Show, was now
putting him in danger of being left behind.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>


<P>
Stieglitz made one last effort to adapt his aesthetic idealism and the
institutions he had developed according to that idealism to the booming
war-time avant-garde art scene. It occurred in the years 1915-1916
in the form of a dual experiment: first, Stieglitz agreed to be a
partner in the publication of an avant-garde review called <I>291</I>,
proposed by Paul Haviland, Marius de Zayas, and Agnes Meyer; and second,
he consented to connect his anti-commercial 291 gallery with Marius
de Zayas's openly commercial Modern Gallery. This episode within the
history of 291 demonstrates a larger, important historical shift in the
institutional structure supporting modernist art in America. This shift
was from an aesthetic and institutional framework of values grounded in
a notion of the sanctity of the act of creation and the object created,
and the artist's privilege to select an audience, to another framework
that involves a satirical, transgressive attitude towards this idealized
sanctity and a more ambivalent and de-personalized relationship between
artist and public.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The latter framework did not, of course,
replace the former once and for all at a discrete moment in history;
but it became more vital and, correspondingly, more visible in the New
York art world during and immediately after the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 The
idealists, like Stieglitz, remained a strong presence, but no longer held
the authoritative leadership role they had once occupied; their elitist
vision of the role of modern art in American society could not recover
fully from the attack it had sustained from the anti-idealist aesthetic.

<P>
In the final pages of the October 1916 issue of <I>Camera Work</I>,
Stieglitz announces at one and the same time the undertaking of the
<I>291</I>/Modern Gallery experiment 
<b></b>
and its results.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

Under the title "'291' and The Modern Gallery," he reprints the
announcement--first published in the October 1915 issue of <I>291</I>
(no.9)--of the 7 October 1915 opening of the Modern Gallery. The
reprinted announcement states that the Modern Gallery would in no
way alter the famous "spirit" of 291: "The Modern Gallery is but an
additional expression of '291.'" After the reprinted announcement,
Stieglitz reports that it had originally been planned to distribute
a circular, one that would explain in greater detail the relationship
between the two galleries and the reasons for creating the new gallery,
but that it had been "withheld because '291' felt it owed no explanations
to anyone, and the above [announcement] was substituted in its stead." It
is important to note, if only in passing, that this substitution, the
insistence on the quasi-scientific nature of this "experiment," and
the article's overall tone of hostile reticence constitute a refusal to
engage in promotional advertising.

<P>
Now, however, in October 1916, several months since The Modern Gallery
and 291 have parted ways, Stieglitz has decided that "the course of
events necessitates a recording in <I>Camera Work</I> [of] the genesis
of the Modern Gallery." He publishes the withheld circular, laying out
the hypothesis behind the experiment--that the post-Armory show climate
might be favorable to avant-garde commercial success--and then reports
the results:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Mr. De Zayas, after experimenting for three months on the lines
contemplated, found that practical business in New York and '291'
were incompatible. In consequence he suggested that '291' and the
Modern Gallery be separated. The suggestion automatically constituted
a separation.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Despite Stieglitz's matter-of-fact tone, it is obvious from the content
of the reprinted circular and from what we know about how Stieglitz ran
291 that the actual reason for the separation had to do with Stieglitz's
anti-commericalism. As stated in the circular, the most important goal in
opening The Modern Gallery was to enable artists (those of the 291 circle
and, especially, Europeans suffering from Europe's collapsed war-time
art market) to make a living from their work--to "pay their own way,"
as de Zayas was fond of saying. This goal may sound unremarkable, since
the primary purpose of galleries since the 19th century has been to turn
a profit for artists and gallery owners. But within the context of 291,
the sole venue for international modern art in America up to this period,
it signalled a radical change of direction. Prior to the Armory Show,
Stieglitz had done little to promote the sale of work of the 291 circle
because he saw his role as spiritual nurturer of creative genius, not
as dealer. True art, according to Stieglitz, is created as a composite
spiritual and scientific search for truth that cannot be compromised by
conventions of taste imposed by the marketplace.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>


<P>
Sometimes Stieglitz did allow his painters to sell their work, but only
if the transaction was completed without regard for market conventions:
Stieglitz believed that to remain aesthetically pure, the artist ought
never to allow the anticipation of a sale to play a role in the creation
of a work (<I>SMB,</I> 132). Specific commissions were thus 
<b></b>
ruled
out, though Stieglitz often secured loans for painters like Hartley,
Marin, and Dove against their future production.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 According
to observers, when an exhibition viewer proposed the purchase of a work,
Stieglitz scrutinized the would be owner in order to determine whether he
was worthy of the work. Worthiness was conferred only if the prospective
purchaser could convince Stieglitz he was unable to live without the piece
(<I>LL,</I> 134; <I>AS,</I> 259; <I>HWW,</I> 81). The slightest hint of
a speculative interest might cause Stieglitz to double the price of the
work. After 1913 Stieglitz became even more anti-commercial as he learned
of the dishonest business practices of some of the New York galleries
that sprang up after the Armory Show (<I>AS,</I> 173; <I>ASAS,</I> 119).

<P>
De Zayas's intention with the Modern Gallery was to end the economic
suffering of the 291 artists caused by the combination of Stieglitz's
anti-commercial institutional philosophy and other galleries' "dishonest
commercialism"; the solution was to "bring the producers of these works
. . . into business touch with the purchasing public on terms of mutual
justice and mutual self-respect."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 De Zayas and his partners
felt that if 291 were to remain artistically alive, it would have to
"evolve" as an institution with respect to the larger contemporary network
of economic and industrial relations that composed the post-Armory Show
art world and, indeed, machine-age American life in general. They did
not share Stieglitz's view that such an evolution would lead inevitably
to the corruption of an artist's originality or genius:

We feel that the phase of our work which has resulted in arousing
an interest in contemporary art in America has reached a point
where, if it is to fulfill itself, it must undertake the affirmative
solution of a problem which it has already negatively solved. We have
already demonstrated that it is possible to avoid commercialism by
eliminating it. But this demonstration will be infertile unless it be
followed by another: namely, that the legitimate function of commercial
intervention--that of paying its own way while bringing the producers and
consumers of art into a relation of mutual service--can be freed from the
chicanery of self-seeking. . . . It is the purpose of the Modern Gallery
to further, by these means, the development of contemporary art both here
and abroad, and to pay its own way by reasonable charges.

<P>
The Modern Gallery was thus conceived as a commercial and intellectual
center where the New York public, with its new post-Armory show
consciousness about modern art, could bridge the previously existing
gulf between contemporary art and American society (<I>HWW,</I> 93,
191). This new consciousness, characterized by an urban cultural vision
common to artist and public, made possible "a relation of mutual justice
and mutual self-respect" between artist and New York public.

<P>
Stieglitz consented to compromise his ideals and enter into association
with the Modern Gallery mostly out of concern for the economic security
of his artist friends
<BR>
--severely over-extended, he was barely able to continue paying
out the stipends he had for some time been distributing to the 291
artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 These practical concerns, however, could not
outweigh his profound disgust for business talk, which made up too much
of the atmosphere at the Modern Gallery for his taste. In late December
of 1915, Stieglitz broke off the relationship between 291 and the Modern
Gallery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 
<b></b>


<P>
Such financial and interpersonal differences form the surface of what was
really a much deeper disagreement between the two parties concerning the
relationship between modernist artists and American society. Stieglitz
took an elitist stance, arguing that there was an essential intellectual
gulf between advanced modern artists and the lagging society around them,
while de Zayas posited the contemporaneity of artist and public. The two
sides demonstrated these opposing views in their respective aesthetic
and institutional philosophies.

<P>
Stieglitz's ideas about the relationship between modern art and
American society are in their most consistent form European secessionist
ideas.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 What makes Stieglitz unique is that he held these
secessionist ideas in tandem with strong opinions about the role for
representation in modernist, post-photography painting. As an alternative
to the academic tradition of juried salon shows and its accompanying
notions of taste and propriety, Stieglitz created an independent
group, the Photo-Secession, which was devoted to photography based upon
self-generated standards formed through independent-minded criticism in
magazines such as his <I>Camera Notes</I> and <I>Camera Work</I>. The work
produced was displayed in non-juried shows held in independent spaces such
as his Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession. This path had been blazed
by the French Impressionists and other Independents, and by the German
and Austrian Secessionists, in the second half of the nineteenth century
(<I>LL,</I> 128; <I>ASP,</I> 52; <I>SMA,</I> 129-130).
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

But because Stieglitz believed that photography, when properly done, ought
to be considered of the same artistic stature as the plastic arts, he
went beyond nineteenth century secessionism. In particular, his belief
that sharp-focus pictorial photography was at the very least equal in
artistic value to realistic representation in painting went hand-in-hand
with his belief that the abstract, non-representational aesthetics of
modern European art were the key to new discoveries in human thought and
imagination. 291 and <I>Camera Work</I> were to be unique laboratories
in which Americans could observe the latest advances and experiments in
both objective (through photography exhibits) and subjective (through
exhibits of modernist art) thought and artistic expression. Stieglitz's
unique understanding of the relationship between photography and plastic
art thus enabled him almost single-handedly to revolutionize the American
art world in a way that his anti-academic contemporaries the Progressives,
including the Ash Can school artists, had been unable to do. The Armory
Show ratified Stieglitz's revolutionary and technology-based embrace
of non-representational art, making plain to the public the enormous
difference in aesthetic sophistication between the American Progressives
and European modernists like Picasso, Braque, Matisse, and Duchamp
(<I>ASAS,</I> 241).

<P>
In pre-Armory Show New York, the art Stieglitz showed at 291 was
so new and, frequently, incomprehensible to the public (and often to
Stieglitz and members of the 291 circle themselves) that, institutionally
speaking, it was beyond the bounds of even the existing independent art
market. The institutional support for such art could not, therefore,
depend principally upon sales. Stieglitz used terms like "the spirit of
291" as shorthand to refer to the way in which he connected original
artists 
<b></b>
such as Marin, Hartley, Dove, Walkowitz, Picabia, and
O'Keefe, among others, with the monetary support of the few patrons and
collectors of avant-garde art in America at the time.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The
manner in which 291 as an institution connected artists and art works
with a supportive public exemplifies the fact that the genesis of this
period's economic market for modernist art was never grounded in simple
economics; it was always to a great extent based in a mystical faith
in experimentation as a sign of progress towards artistic truth, and
thus relied upon decidedly uneconomic ways of thinking. Individuals who
patronized the artists of 291 idealized notions of craftsmanship and
creative genius, and the atmosphere of 291 served as a referent for those
ideals, a place where, through the work and talk of the community gathered
there, a unique truth seemed to come into existence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 In such
an atmosphere the artists and art objects took on a composite sacred and
scientific aura that separated them from and rendered them superior to
the outside culture's values of popularity and/or commercial success.

<P>
I am using the word "aura" to describe the atmosphere for
avant-garde/modernist art Stieglitz created at 291 because I want to take
issue with the way this term has been used to describe the intentions of
the historical avant-garde ever since Benjamin first used it in his essay
"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." B&uuml;rger and
Huyssen have refined the term, eliminating its faulty "pseudomaterialist"
account of cause and effect: abandoning Benjamin's base-superstructure
model, they emphasize instead the historical avant-garde artist's
conscious intention to destroy the aura of his works, noting that
the mechanical means for doing so often didn't even exist at the time
(<I>TAG,</I> 34; <I>AGD,</I> 10). But avant-garde and modernist art in
New York raises problems for this use of the term, insofar as Stieglitz
completely contradicts Benjamin's theory, even in its refined form:
Stieglitz was an avant-garde re who at one and the same time
devoted himself to the artistic use of the latest technology, both in
photography and printing, yet was a firm believer in the modernist artist
as genius-creator of works of transcendental power valued for their
originality, authenticity, craftsmanship, and, unsurprisingly, ultimate
incomprehensibility. Describing Stieglitz's attitude, de Zayas wrote:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It would be a mistake to think that Stieglitz's purpose and objective
was to make people understand modern art. . . . Stieglitz believed
and had faith in something he did not know and had he known it, he
would not have believed in it. . . . The exhibitions of modern art and
pictorial photography were only the flesh and bones of the 'Spirit [of
291]' for everybody to see but only for the very few selected ones to
understand. . . . In Stieglitz's hands modern art had transcendental
value. [<I>HWW,</I> 84-85]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Benjamin's opposition between mass-produced machine or print reproduction
on the one hand and artistic authenticity on the other never occured
to Stieglitz.

<P>
In using the term "aura" to describe the atmosphere at the undeniably
avant-garde 291, I want to show how the standard emphasis on the
destruction of aura as the most significant accomplishment of
the avant-garde obscures a more important 
<b></b>
issue, that of the
avant-garde's desire for contemporaneity. The significance of the clash
between Stieglitz's aesthetic and institutional philosophy and the de
Zayas-Picabia aesthetic and institutional philosophy lies not so much in
what it reveals about the avant-garde's desire to destroy (bourgeois)
art's aura as in the belief on the part of de Zayas and Picabia that
Stieglitz's brand of avant-gardism was preventing modernist art from
becoming fully contemporary with American society. The perceived
need for the Modern Gallery grew out of the sense that the role of
machines in American life revealed something about American culture's
quintessential modernity. Given a truly modern society, then, de Zayas,
following Picabia, believed that artists in America needed only to
find the appropriate aesthetic and institutional form to express this
modernity. Once they had found the proper form, they would produce work
worthy of the time and milieu. What I am describing, then, is actually
the inverse of B&uuml;rger's claim that, historically, "the intention
of the avant-gardiste may be defined as the attempt to direct toward
the practical the aesthetic experience (which rebels against the praxis
of life) that Aestheticism developed" (<I>TAG,</I> 34). As will become
apparent, American commodity culture became the standard of modernity
against which the post-Armory show New York avant-garde measured its
work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<P>
Stieglitz's post-Armory Show turn inward to emphasize purity and aesthetic
idealism at 291 indicates that he felt that the popularity of modern art
generated by the show had disrupted and undermined this faith in an aura
of truth surrounding the 291 art works and their creators (<I>AS,</I>
173). The event that confirmed Stieglitz in his retreat into idealism
was the failure (from Stieglitz's point of view) of the <I>291</I>/Modern
Gallery experiment. Through a return to the penultimate issue of <I>Camera
Work</I> I now would like to show that what was at stake in Stieglitz's
brief partnership with the <I>291</I> review and the Modern Gallery
was nothing less than Stieglitz's auracular aesthetic and institutional
philosophy. For just as the institutional philosophy of the 291 gallery
was in many ways of a piece with the aesthetic beliefs propounded there,
so too was the commercial institutional philosophy of the Modern Gallery
associated with an aesthetic. Stieglitz realized this fact, as evidenced
by his editorial decision to follow the article discussed above, "'291'
and the Modern Gallery," with a reprint of a de Zayas article, from the
July-August 1915 issue (no. 5-6) of <I>291</I>.

<P>
"New York n'a pas vu d'abord/ New York did not see at first" concludes
the famous issue consisting of five mechanomorphic drawings created by
Francis Picabia in New York in 1915. When viewed in the context of its
entire run, this issue of <I>291</I> stands out as the review's most
focused and programatic number. De Zayas' article denounces Stieglitz's
291 philosophy as inadequate to the current relationship between modern
art and its New York public, and proclaims a new aesthetic-institutional
framework to replace it. Subsequent issues of <I>291</I> were primarily
taken up with explaining or extrapolating from the ideas expressed in
this issue.

Picabia's five drawings are mechanomorphic portraits of, in order,
Stieglitz, Picabia himself, Agnes Ernst Meyer, de Zayas, and Paul
Haviland. Taken as a group, 
<b></b>
these portraits or caricatures demystify
their subjects on at least two levels. Beginning with the first of the
portraits (<A HREF="4.3lewis_1.html">
 1</A>), "Ici, c'est ici Stieglitz/ Foi et Amour" depicts
a broken camera whose bellows droops away from the subject before its
lens, the word "IDEAL" printed in German Gothic script. The fatigued
or impotent lens is accompanied by an automobile gear-shift and brake
handle in the background that are somehow attached to the camera. The
collage-like combination of these two components communicates a general
sense of sexualized mechanical breakdown--not only is the camera useless
for picture-taking, but the 
<b></b>
gear-shift (whatever its relation to
the camera) is in the neutral position, and the brake is set in the
parked or stopped position.

The mechanomorphic drawing associated with de Zayas is a similarly strange
mechanism (<A HREF="4.3lewis_2.html">
 2</A>), though it communicates a mechanized sexual vigor that
the limp lens does not. This is a key difference, as we shall see. The
drawing is difficult to interpret because the particular personal episodes
in de Zayas' life to which the drawing may refer remain a mystery. At
least three scholars have put forward interpretations of this drawing,
but none identifies all the drawing's components or provides a fully
convincing account of how the machine works. Dickran Tashjian sees at
the upper left a coin-operated sighting device, common on the sea-shore,
directing the gaze to a suspended female corset (<I>SP,</I> 39). Camfield
convincingly shows that this drawing (as well as others) is derived
mostly from advertisements using schematic diagrams of electrical systems
(<I>FP</I>, . 105, 110) which Picabia adapted so as to connect the
corset (moving clockwise from the upper left) "by a line from the region
of the heart to what appears to be a gigantic spark plug, a hand crank,
and two automobile headlights (lower left and right) with a female plug
between them that eventually connects (as does the hand crank) at the
point of sex on the corset" (<I>FP,</I> 84).

<P>
I want to supplement these helpful accounts by considering how the
text of this piece may help to clarify the relationship between the
sighting device and the corset contraption. In the upper right corner
are the words "J'AI VU et c'est de toi qu'il s'agit" ["I SAW and this
[i.e. this 'portrait'] is about you"]; at the lower left are the words
"DE ZAYAS! DE ZAYAS! JE SUIS VENU SUR LES RIVAGES DU PONT-EUXIN," above
which is depicted the sun setting over water. The latter bit of text
is based on Ovid's poem of exile, the <I>Tristia</I> (it most closely
resembles V.ii., lines 63-64). But the alteration of the text seems
important: whereas Ovid always accompanies his evocations of the Euxine
(the savage shores of the Black Sea, site of his unhappy exile) with
adjectives such as "sinister," "formless," or "ill-omened," Picabia
leaves out any such description. Picabia's 1915 return to New York is
red, then, as an exile on a strange shore, but free of complaint or
lamentation. Indeed, if it is Picabia who, shipboard, is looking through
the sighting device (as the "J'ai vu" seems to suggest) and crying out
"De Zayas, De Zayas!" as he approaches shore, the sight he sees is a
mechanized peep show, a vision of a girating "fille n&eacute;e sans
m&egrave;re" set into motion by de Zayas' efforts on behalf of modern
art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 It might be that this sight gives a jolt to Picabia's
imagination by way of the spark plug, illuminating in him (hence the
headlights) the insight, key at this time in his career, that the world
of art is a desire-fueled machine of the same order as the American car
industry Picabia so admired.

Though many details remain mysterious, it is clear that the mechanomorphic
structure depicted here, like the one caricaturing Stieglitz, offers a
humorous commentary on its subject, in which sex, machines, and art play
a role. The de Zayas portrait presents a machine that, though hardly
sleek or refined, functions vigorously (at least on paper), contrasting
with the malfunctioning Stieglitz portrait. Taken in conjunction with
the portrait that precedes "De Zayas! De Zayas!," the drawing of the

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 78]</b>
spark-plug (<A HREF="4.3lewis_3.html">
 3</A>) entitled "Portrait d'une jeune fille
am&eacute;ricaine dans l'&eacute;tat de nudit&eacute;" ["Portrait of
an American girl in the state of nudity"], the viewer is confirmed
in the overall impression that artistic creativity is a function of
mechanized sexual desire, red in these works by jolting, grinding,
and jerking chains of cause and effect.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 This mechanized
and sexualized creativity is not transcendent in its passion; it never
attains satisfaction or release. The word "For-ever" on the spark-plug,
for instance, parodies loving devotion, the source 
<b></b>
of comfort
and consistency in any relationship. "For-ever" here becomes a slogan
advertising the consistent efficacy of a nude American girl for firing
up the strange engine of sexual desire, a constant jolt driving the
artist to express himself; he does so in terms of brakes and gear-shifts
which engage to produce constant erotic agitation, without guarantee of
eventual release or relaxation.

The remaining drawings continue the theme: the inscription under the
lamp portraying Paul Haviland (<A HREF="4.3lewis_4.html">
 4</A>), "La po&eacute;sie est comme lui"
["Poetry is like him"], professes the idealist aesthete's quasi-religious
conception of poetry as the secular light of the world, a sentiment
parodically overshadowed by the fact that the soldier-shaped lamp in
the drawing is not only unplugged but unpluggable--it is literally
missing its plug. Finally, Picabia's self-portrait (<A HREF="4.3lewis_5.html">
 5</A>) employing a
car horn positioned against what appears to be the cross-section of an
automobile cylinder and spark plug suggests that the only efficiently
working machine depicted in this series is one that calls attention
to itself, "blowing its own horn," as Maria Llu&iuml;sa Borr&agrave;s
has 
<b></b>
remarked.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 The inscription Picabia includes, "Le
Saint des Saints/ C'est de moi qu'il s'agit dans ce portrait," suggests
through its ironic conflation of the divine ("The Holy of Holies") with
the artist and the machine that the traditional hierarchy of creators
creating in their respective images may in modern society ultimately
reduce to a schematic blueprint for a machine that operates without
regard for distinctions between divine, spiritual, and industrial
registers of creation.

<P>
These captioned images, then, taken as a whole, can be read as an effort
to demystify Stieglitz's ideal of art as the emanation of genius complete
unto itself; they replace the transcendental satisfaction of creative
desire with blueprints expressing creativity as a mechanized eroticism
without an off button. This contrasts with Stieglitz's photographs
of nudes, as well as those he chose to print in <I>Camera Work</I> by
other photographers, all of which are steeped in a symbolist aesthetic
of the transcendance of erotic desire through artistic beauty. At
another aesthetic or formal level, Picabia's drawings challenge even
further the notion of the artist as creative genius because they are
composed almost entirely of what we now call found objects. The camera,
circuitry schematics, spark-plug, lamp, and car horn are all copied from
trade catalogues or advertisements, while the captions are in many cases
taken from 
<b></b>
the pink pages of the <I>Petit Larousse</I>, the section
of that dictionary where famous phrases from other languages (primariy
Latin and Greek) are translated into French.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Creativity has
of course not been expunged from these pieces simply through the use of
found objects and phrases. But the nature of this particular creativity
is quite different from that held in high esteem by Stieglitz. There
is a clever, parasitic quality to this aesthetic that runs against the
grain of the 291 aesthetic.

<P>
To be sure, Stieglitz enjoyed poking fun at art critics, the public,
and even himself, but usually in a way that made him out to be the
master casting pearls before swine. Stieglitz's idea of satire was to
highlight the public's overwhelming stupidity and need for guidance in
matters of art: the artist or avant-garde impresario was never satirized,
only the public. An example of what he felt was a satirical "experiment"
involved his refusal to promote the sale of the last issue of <I>291</I>,
in which his famous photograph "The Steerage" was reproduced. His
idea was that by not advertising, one would be able to gauge what the
"American people would do when left to themselves." The "satire" came
after the issue's unsurprisingly dismal sales, when he decided to have
a rag picker come to take away the eight thousand unsold copies of the
photograph, including the deluxe prints: he would go ironically along
with the public in its stupidity, throwing away two dollar copies of
a print that "an official of a Berlin museum had been willing to pay a
hundred dollars for" (<I>ASAS,</I> 127).

<P>
Picabia's parodic creativity is different because, rather than resisting
machine-age commodity culture through an exalted act of supersession, he
parodically employs its very images and logic--in these drawings, man
has been replaced by his own creation, the machine, which achieves and
fails in precisely the same way he does, only more transparently, because
stripped of any veil of idealism. In this way art functions in parallel
with the industrial economy. The conjunction of image and inscription
lays symbolically bare the erotic essence of machine age modernity as
Picabia envisions it. Picabia says as much in an October, 1915 interview
with <I>The New York Tribune</I>: the machine and the commodity culture
it symbolizes are "more than a mere adjunct of life. [The machine] is
really a part of human life--perhaps its very soul."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 As
such, machines necessarily dictate the direction of his very artistic
project. He goes on to say that he "doesn't know what possibilities may
be in store" for this project; this is because, as a kind of machine
himself, he cannot place himself at an ideal point outside the mechanism
and view his trajectory.

<P>
Picabia's embrace of the objects and commodity logic of the machine-age,
as represented in his mechanomorphic aesthetic, entails an institutional
corollary, one that admits the buying and selling of art objects as
a legitimate enterprise. The art object that is created out of the
industrial world of commodified machines, indeed as one of those
commodities, renders meaningless the definition of artistic purity
as the operation of the creative genius in a space untouched by
considerations of popularity or financial success. Picabia views his
two-dimensional machines as part and parcel of the larger universe of
three-dimensional machines, a universe encompassing humans and all
the objects they make.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 I don't believe that Picabia's
intention in these drawings was merely to create something saleable. My
point is that the truth 
<b></b>
value of this work exists on a different
plane from that sanctioned by Stieglitz. Instead of being positively
articulated in the recognition of the sanctified originality of the
canvas, Picabia's artistic truth reveals itself in the comic, negative
recognition afforded by the mechanomorphic image. This image negates the
idealistic viewer's belief in a higher realm of art with a schematic
diagram of the mechanized workings of human erotic desire, including
the mechanism of artistic creation itself. What de Zayas characterized
in the Modern Gallery's prospectus as Stieglitz's "negative solution" to
the problem of commercialism--its elimination--has been replaced with a
new solution, the destruction of idealism built into the work in a way
that, paradoxically, renders the issue of commercialism of secondary
importance. Whether the artist is compensated or not for his effort in
creating this negative recognition is beside the point, because the power
of the negative recognition will not be changed by the buying or selling
of the piece. The piece is thus fertile in its erotic infertility,
its refusal of transcendence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The negative recognition
is built into the parodic logic of the representation, which itself
is simply a machine among machines, rather than an "art object" <I>per
se</I>. The effect of the negative recognition is not dependent upon an
aura surrounding the work that must be protected from unworthy buyers who
may not respect it. Thus, the effect on the viewer of Picabia's machine
art can thrive in a different institutional framework than Stieglitz's
idealistic enclave.

<P>
The de Zayas-Haviland-Meyer group heralded Picabia's machine art as
the product of a new aesthetic-institutional practice that could renew
the vitality of 291. It is difficult to determine the nuances of the
group's understanding of this new aesthetic because it did not publish
close analyses of the mechanomorphic drawings. But there is no doubt
that its members understood the institutional consequences and economic
ramifications of the mechanomorphic aesthetic--de Zayas' use of sexual
metaphors to describe Picabia's effect on American culture attests
to that.

<P>
Why was open commercialism a consequence of this aesthetic? The <I>291</I>
group understood Picabia's mechanomorphic art broadly as a celebration
of the machine, which they took to be an emanation of the objectively
modern essence of America. Paul Haviland writes an editorial to this
effect in the very next issue of <I>291</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 De Zayas,
in the <I>291</I> article which follows Picabia's five drawings, uses
this link between the machine, objectivity, and American modernity to
comment upon and, ultimately, criticize Stieglitz's work at the 291
gallery. He begins by writing that American intellectuals have prevented
New York from assimilating the true spirit of modern art; that they have
"covered" that spirit--the metaphor is that of contraception--with false
"ideal[s]" borrowed from Europe. American culture is at its core modern
("all American activities are entirely in accord with the spirit of modern
art . . . America has the same complex mentality as the true modern
artist [:] the same continual need of expressing itself in the present
and for the present"), but most Americans are not aware of this fact,
and as a consequence little truly significant modern American art has
been created. Most American intellectuals and critics, says de Zayas,
are incapable of leading America to the knowledge of its essential
modernity 
<b></b>
because they are non-creative popularizers who merely
copy and reiterate the past theories and positions of European movements
without producing anything vital. They lack a sense of, or a commitment
to, contemporaneity. Their tendency to follow rather than innovate means
that, in the current (post-Armory Show) commercial climate, they are
really only concerned with lining their own pockets: "The critics do not
work to develop their knowledge, or to spread knowledge. . . . The press
has established a false notion of American life. It has succeeded in
creating in the American people a fictitious need for a false art and a
false literature. The press has in view but one thing:--profit." In this
environment, the goal of the Modern Gallery is to appeal directly to the
American public's inherent taste for contemporaneity, thus circumventing
the critics' attempts to purvey stale art and ideas.

<P>
The <I>291</I> group was intensely interested in assessing the
consequences, both artistic and commercial, of the new popularity of
modern art in post-1913 New York. The brief article entitled "Economic
Laws and Art" from the satire/notes page of the second issue of <I>291</I>
(April 1915) attests to this interest and demonstrates an openness to
the possibility that popularity and up-to-the-minute modernity could go
hand in hand, a possibility Stieglitz would never entertain. Here they
note the increasing economic success of modern art galleries in New York
in 1915, and ask whether this popularity is ultimately good or bad for
art. Their stance is not automatically anti-commercial; rather, they
look at commercialism as a tool that is in and of itself value-neutral:

The mere fact that [the Montross show of American Moderns] can take place
on Fifth Avenue where rents must be paid, is an important indication of
the change of the public attitude and the added fact that the gallery
was usually crowded at five cents per head, shows that the interest is
not spotty but widespread. In short, it is safe to announce that cubism
or futurism, or whatever else these men call their work, is not only
beginning to pay its way, but is undergoing the trying ordeal of being
the fashion. The obvious question is: 'Who took the lead, the artists or
the public?' In other words, is American cubism, or futurism, so sincere
an expression that the speedy conversion of the public to its serious
consideration was inevitable, or did the public interest, aroused by
291 and the big Armory Exhibition of French moderns, create a demand
which our men are trying consciously or unconsciously to supply? Judging
from results in the Montross exhibition, both kinds of influence are
present, thus leaving to the buying public an interesting opportunity
of furthering modern thought by weeding out the true from the false . . .

The question that animated and worried Stieglitz--namely, are
artists being true to their own creativity, or merely trying to fill
a speculated need in a burgeoning market?--remains a question that
intrigues Stieglitz's associates. Their methods for finding an answer,
however, differ from his in important ways: Stieglitz saw himself as
sole arbiter of the question, while the <I>291</I> writers emphasize the
essential role of the public in any answer, guardedly putting faith in
the public's ability, in the words of the article, to "further modern
thought by weeding out the true from the false." The 
<b></b>
 <I>291</I>
editors found evidence in the urban life around them that the American
"buying public" was animated, at least in part, by the same spirit
of modernity driving modern art--with the sole caveat being that the
public, not fully aware of its true modernity, may need to learn to
discern between the true and the merely fashionable before it can see
itself in the art it faces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 De Zayas makes explicit his
belief that Stieglitz and his work at 291 failed to render the New York
public adequately aware of its true up-to-the-minute modernist identity:
"The real American life is still unexpressed," writes de Zayas.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
America remains to be discovered. Stieglitz wanted to work this
miracle. He wanted to discover America. Also, he wanted the Americans to
discover themselves. But, in pursuing his object, he employed the shield
["capote" in the French version of the article, slang for condom] of
psychology and metaphysics. He has failed.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For de Zayas, the problem with Stieglitz is that he treated the spirit
of modern art (the essence of American culture) like a mystical entity
removed from immediate life rather than an expression of contemporary
culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Stieglitz surrounded and immobilized this spirit
with what de Zayas calls "prejudices," his word for the aura which,
by perpetuating a certain elitism associated with style, has prevented
Americans from keeping up with their own modernity as it is reflected
back to them in truly evolving modern art. Americans falsely took these
static prejudices for modernity; consequently, when, thanks to the efforts
of the lawyer and collector John Quinn, the tariff on art imports fell
after the Armory Show and the art market expanded, a false notion of art
became popularized and institutionalized by both profit-seeking critics
and laggard artists (whom de Zayas labels "copyists"). This taste for
false art acted as a brake on the evolution of modern art, diverting
attention from objective contemporary instances of modern life into dead
styles or "methods" of the recent past:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Art is a white lie that is only living when it is born of truth. And
there is no other truth than objective truth. The others are but
prejudices. Stieglitz tried to discover America with prejudices. He first,
and he alone, has placed before New York the various foundation supports
of the evolution of modern art. He wished to work through suggestion. But
soon, commercialism brought an avalanche of paintings. Those lepers,
those scullery maids of art, those Sudras of progress--the copyists, got
busy. They even believed themselves to be part of the evolution because,
instead of copying trees, they copied a method. America remains to be
discovered. And to do it there is but one way:--DISCOVER IT!
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
De Zayas believes that the institutional framework for modern art
that Stieglitz devised was weak because it relied upon subjective
expression--"suggestion"--rather than a direct, objective presentation
of modernity as it is, in motion. For de Zayas, photography is the
art-form <I>par excellence</I> for the revelation of the outer world's
objective nature. In de Zayas' eyes, then, Stieglitz began his work
as a modernist appropriately: as a proponent of straight (or what de
Zayas calls "static") photography, 
<b></b>
Stieglitz stood for modernist
objectivity. In claiming artistic superiority for straight photography
over photography involving the manipulation of negatives, Stieglitz
demonstrated a truly modern consciousness of the machine's objectifying
power over and against aestheticizing "prejudice" or nostalgia: continuing
the sexual metaphor, de Zayas writes, "[Stieglitz] worked in the American
spirit. He married Man to Machinery and obtained issue."

<P>
Stieglitz failed, however, when he attempted to modernize American
plastic expression. His failure lay in the way he presented modern art
to the public. He asked the American public to look at modern work as
Art, a rarefied distillation of genius emanating from and appealing
to a certain initiated segment of society, rather than the sign of the
public's own unacknowledged, constantly evolving vital energy:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
When he wanted to ["obtain issue"] with art, he imported works capable
of serving as examples of modern thought plastically expressed. His
intention was to have them used as supports for finding an expression of
the conception of American life. He found against him open opposition and
servile imitation. He did not succeed in bringing out the individualistic
expression of the spirit of the community. He has put the American
art public to the test. He has fought to change <I>good taste</I> into
<I>common sense</I>. But he has not succeeded in putting in motion the
enormous mass of the inertia of this public's self-sufficiency. America
has not the slightest conception of the value of the work accomplished by
Stieglitz. Success, and success on a large scale, is the only thing that
can make an impression on American mentality. Any effort, any tendency,
which does not possess the radiation of advertising remains practically
ignored. America waits, inertly, for its own potentiality to be expressed
in art.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Many critics, particularly those who want to see de Zayas and <I>291</I>
as proto-dada and, thus, critical of capitalism in a way that fits with
B&uuml;rger's or Huyssen's characterizations of the avant-garde, take this
passage as an indictment of "the radiation of advertising" and American
commercialism in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Yet, when read in context, we can
see that this phrase expresses de Zayas' sincere belief that commercialism
has been and could continue to be an important defining trait of the
essentially modernist American identity. Americans as a people of mixed
origins and beliefs will never express themselves in art unconsciously,
says de Zayas, because they are not a unified people with a culturally
inbred second nature--a cultural "common sense" naturally imbued with
"good taste"--that flows from a national tradition. The heterogeneity
of American culture, says de Zayas, shows through "in politics, in
industry, in science, in commerce, in finance, in the popular theatre,
in architecture, in sport, in dress," realms of life in which Americans
have been unafraid to "get rid of European prejudices and [create their]
own laws in accordance with [their] own customs." But things have been
different in the realm of art, says de Zayas. In art, Americans feel the
need for an "exotic education"; in learning to copy European methods they
develop "an inner censorship" which blocks a direct perception of the
heterogeneous truth of the American "milieu." Result: "They do not see
their surroundings at first hand." De Zayas describes those surroundings
in striking terms:
<b></b>


<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
One lives here [in the United States] in a continuous change which makes
impossible the perpetuation and the universality of an idea. History in
the United States is impossible and meaningless. One lives here in the
present. In a continuous struggle to adapt oneself to the milieu. . . . In
the United States there is no general sentiment in any sphere of thought.
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
According to de Zayas, Picabia recognizes that Americans are really
modernists, that "America has the same complex mentality as the true
modern artist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 In keeping with this realization, Picabia
has created art in America that does not imitate existing false notions
of artistic propriety. He has achieved this, says de Zayas, by seizing
upon everyday objects (machines, schematic renderings of mechanisms,
images in advertisements and catalogues) and undercutting the viewer's
attempts to remove them to a higher realm separate from the milieu in
which they were found--that is, he refuses them the status of "art," in
de Zayas' sense of that word. Implied in the sustained use of sexual and
reproductive metaphor is de Zayas's conviction that Picabia accomplishes
this undercutting through the blasphemous juxtaposition of a found machine
image with a found bit of relatively exalted text (for example, the
sacred phrase "Le saint des saints" in the self-caricature, or the epic
lyricism of "Je suis venu sur les rivages du Pont-Euxin" in the de Zayas
portrait), a transgressive act which works together with the eroticizing
of these objects to suggest that American modernity is grounded in a new,
non-transcendable sexuality objectified by machines. De Zayas refers
to this kind of eroticized, blasphemous rejection of the tradition of
idealistic art at the end of his article when he holds up Picabia as
the hope for a truly vital (and virile) American modern art. He writes,
"Of all those who have come to conquer America, Picabia is the only one
who has done as did Cortez. He has burned his ship behind him. He does
not protect himself with any shield ["capote"]. He has married America
like a man who is not afraid of consequences. He has obtained results."

<P>
Stieglitz's decision to reprint in <I>Camera Work,</I> one after the
other, the withheld circular stating the goals of the Modern Gallery,
this essay from <I>291</I>, and an "Epitaph for Alfred Stieglitz" by
Marsden Hartley attests to his understanding that the Modern Gallery
and Picabia's mechanomorphic style were complementary parts in a plan to
replace him with a new institution. The talk of his failure and the use of
the past tense to describe his achievements must have been particularly
hard to take in 1915, especially in an organ like <I>291</I>, which
he was supporting with his own money, space, labor, and reputation. De
Zayas, despite the emasculating rhetoric in his article, sought not so
much to replace Stieglitz as to bring him and his achievements at 291
(especially his pathbreaking insights into the relationship between
photography and modern art) to greater effect by showing Stieglitz the
ways in which modern art and everyday American culture were intimately
linked in their common contemporaneity.

<P>
What ultimately became of de Zayas' project? Ironically, the Modern
Gallery was a great success with the public, but a financial failure. De
Zayas was not a very good salesman, and this fact, coupled with his habit
of not keeping records, eventually made his European suppliers wary of
lending him their works on consignment 
<b></b>
(<I>MDZ,</I> 50).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

The Arensbergs bought the majority of their collection there and at the
De Zayas Gallery, which succeeded The Modern Gallery from 1919-1921
and which they backed financially (<I>AS,</I> 196).

<P>
The tie to the Arensbergs suggests that de Zayas' interest in the
mechanomorphic aesthetic continued, since the Arensbergs' apartment was
the gathering place until 1920 for artists inspired by machines and found
objects, including Man Ray and Duchamp, as well as Picabia. Evidence also
suggests that de Zayas's view of the compatibility between commerce and
the mechanomorphic aesthetic lived on in the Arensberg circle. When in
1921 Man Ray describes to Tristan Tzara the end of New York dada, he is
not at all unfriendly to the commercial and promotional philosophy of
the earlier Modern Gallery:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Cher Tzara, dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will
not tolerate a rival,--will not notice dada. It is true that no efforts
to make it public have been made, beyond the placing of your and our
dadas in the bookshops, but there is no one here to work for it, and
no money to be taken in for it, or donated to it. So dada in New York
must remain a secret. . . . The appearance of New York dada was made
possible through the generosity of a few poor friends, but it cannot go
on so. Perhaps in the future we may do something again.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The belief that avant-garde art expresses the unconscious essence of
modern New York remains ("all New York is dada"), but the energy and
finances needed to make people aware of this fact are lacking.

<P>
Despite the fact that it was not as successful in practice as it promised
to be, the genesis of The Modern Gallery out of 291 and the differences
it brought to light between Stieglitz and the Haviland-Meyer-de
Zayas-Picabia group signify a larger shift in the aesthetic as well as the
institutional framework of modern art in New York in the years following
the Armory Show. For instance, Robert J. Coady's gallery and his magazine
<I>The Soil</I> (1916-1917) portrayed popular American culture,
especially sports, comedy, and heavy machinery such as steam hammers and
locomotive engines, as proper ground for modern art in America, while
Marcel Duchamp's ready-mades challenged the aesthetic and institutional
bounds of art along lines similar to those of Picabia; Duchamp in turn
influenced the artists who came into contact with him at the Arensbergs'
apartment. And in both cases, we find proponents of modern art positioning
themselves, like de Zayas, in a guardedly optimistic manner with regard
to the commodification of the art object. This tempered acceptance
of commodification as a fact of modernity, which, as we have seen,
grew out of a benign view of American commodity culture as the organic
expression of technologized modernity, needs to be taken into account in
characterizations of the historical avant-garde's engagement with society.

<P>
The desire to be contemporary held by avant-gardists such as Picabia
and de Zayas has significance for our understanding of the historical
avant-garde. Recognizing its importance is crucial to assessing the
enthusiasm for America manifested by res such as Marcel Duchamp,
Picabia, and others whom scholars such 
<b></b>
as Huyssen and B&uuml;rger
include as members of the historical avant-garde. For them, America seemed
to epitomize modernity: it was truly the <I>new</I> world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

Exploitation of this essential modernity, rather than opposition to
high bourgeois culture and its art institutions, struck them as being
of utmost importance. Artists like Picabia, Duchamp and de Zayas, or,
for that matter, Man Ray, Joseph Stella, Charles Demuth, or Charles
Sheeler, did not believe that American society required fundamental
transformation before it could embrace modern art. Instead, art
needed to evolve in the direction of contemporary consumer society if
it was itself to be truly expressive of modernity. In their opinion,
Americans were at worst merely unconscious of their society's inherent
avant-garde tendencies and therefore in need of little more than a
dose of self-consciousness. Accordingly, the post-Armory Show New York
avant-garde optimistically placed the modern fact of art commodification
at the center of its artistic production; it was a process that promised
both European and American artists an opportunity to establish continuity
between modernist art and modern life.

<P>
Because theorists have not acknowledged the importance of this
notion, they tend to misread the meaning of a key theme in art of
the period--machine imagery and technology. Huyssen, for instance,
perceptively notes the "crucial" role of technology and the "technological
imagination" in historical avant-garde art. But he interprets the
importance of that role solely in terms of its oppositional value:
technology was used by the historical avant-garde in a revolutionary
manner to transform life through art. The opposite, however, seems true
in the example at hand: the New York avant-garde's identification of
technology with the essence of mainstream American society and culture
resulted in the conviction that <I>art</I> could be transformed and
rendered truly modern by <I>life</I>--at least here. The Anglo-Saxon world
was the origin of technological innovation and the seat of a society
thoroughly modernized by technology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Major res of the
historical avant-garde--several of whom would later be involved with
continental dada--created work in New York <I>not</I> with the intent
of abolishing the institutional category of 'art' by using avant-garde
creations to transform an anti-modernist society; rather, they attempted
to dissolve the barrier between art and life by creating art objects
that would be the contemporary, organic expression of a pre-existing
modernist society and culture.

<P>
Over-emphasis on the oppositional character of the avant-garde has
created an artificial chasm separating avant-garde res from their
contemporaries. Terms such as "high modernism," then, can become a
dumping ground for any writer or artist who is not easily accounted for
strictly in terms of opposition. Examples of avant-gardism in America
in the early twentieth century, such as those of Stieglitz and the
artists surrounding him, demonstrate how the idea of America as the
epitome of a culture thoroughly imbued with technological modernity
could lead artists to accept the fact of art's commodification
and create out of that acceptance, doing so in the belief that it
would allow them fuller participation in the contemporaneous whole of
modernity. These avant-gardists necessarily regarded the establishment
of a just commercial relationship between artist and public--what
de Zayas termed 
<b></b>
"mutual service"--as social ratification of
that fuller participation, because they recognized that monetary worth
makes up such an important part of the way modern society expresses its
values. Insofar as concerns of this sort continue to be essential in
our contemporary debates about art, such clear-headedness about modern
values may be worthy of admiration. It can remind us that desires other
than oppositionality often motivated the activities of the historical
avant-garde and testify to the ongoing importance, for art and for
artists, of a sense of contemporaneity.

This shift may sound like the one from autonomous art to non-autonomous
art familiar to readers of B&uuml;rger. The difference here is that,
in this example, both institutions are undeniably avant-garde, and the
avant-garde institution devoted to the idea of autonomous art (bourgeois
and capitalist in B&uuml;rger's reading) was anti-commercial, while the
one replacing it was openly commercial.

In the world of literary modernism, The Sunwise Turn, a New York
modernist bookstore in operation from 1916-1927, represented within
one institution the tension between these two attitudes towards the fact
of a consumer economy for modernist work (see Lawrence Rainey, "Consuming
Investments: Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>," <I>James Joyce Quarterly</I> 33
[Summer 1996]: 551-55). The store had two owners: Harold Loeb, like
de Zayas, considered the "profit system" a fact of life and committed
himself to operating without a loss, while his Stieglitz-like partner,
Mary Mowbray Clarke, expressed a preference for cultural patronage from
the wealthy over the "evil" of "profit." The strain ultimately proved
too great: Rainey tells us Loeb sold his share of the shop in early 1921
(Rainey, 554). Significantly, Clarke and her first partner originally
planned to locate their store in the 291 building.

Naumann, <I>NYD,</I> 20, interprets the 1913 painting "Culture
physique" ["Physical Culture"], painted after Picabia's first trip to
New York, from Jan to April 1913, to show that Picabia probably thought
of art in terms of commodification well before his mechanomorphic phase.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT27" HREF="#REF27">27</A>.
Many of Picabia's mechanomorphic drawings of the period 1915-1919
are inspired by this notion of technology as ring a quintessentially
modern form of artistic reproduction that functions parodically in
a manner contrary to the laws of human reproduction: see "La fille
n&eacute;e sans m&egrave;re" ["The Girl Born without a Mother"],
"L'Enfant carburateur" ["Child Carburetor"], "Prostitution universelle"
["Universal Prostitution"] in <I>NYD</I>, 62-65, 69-72. Though
not eroticized with the same obsessive energy, the mechanomorphic work
of Duchamp and Jean Crotti, working with Picabia in New York at the
same time, and of Americans such as Charles Demuth, Morton Schamberg and
Man Ray, all frequenters of the Arensberg circle, exhibit similar erotic
conceptions of the machine as creative in a way that parodies normal human
sexuality and fertility: see Duchamp's "Fountain," cocoa grinders, and
"Large Glass," Crotti's 1916 "The Mechanical Forms of Love in Movement,"
Man Ray's 1919 "My First Born," and Schamberg's 1916 "Machine" (<I>FP,</I>
plates 146, 148, 149). Camfield evokes the literary erotic machines
of Raymond Roussel and Alfred Jarry (particularly as represented in
<I>Impressions d'Afrique,</I> 1912, and <I>Le Surm&acirc;le,</I> 1911,
respectively) as likely influences on Picabia (<I>FP,</I> 78-79).

A short note in the <I>New York American,</I> 1 November 1915,
considers the significance of modern art's popularity in connection with
The Modern Gallery itself, stating, "The question of how far the ideas of
a comparatively small number of artists are biting into the consciousness
of the community will be solved by the world's test of having arrived--the
saleable value of the product. This will be something, though it will
not settle the real value of the ideas" (quoted in <I>HWW,</I> 95).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT30" HREF="#REF30">30</A>.
Looking back on 1915, "the golden year for modern art," de Zayas
says that he strived to make the Modern Gallery a place where people
could "think for themselves." "I wanted to bring the artist in contact
with the public, the producer with the consumer without intermediaries"
(<I>HWW,</I> 71, 94). He contrasts this philosophy with that of Stieglitz,
who "dealt with the public individually, putting the visitor to a sort
of third degree to get at their [sic] mental reactions" (<I>HWW,</I> 126).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT31" HREF="#REF31">31</A>.
Tashjian (<I>SP,</I> 40) and Arturo Schwarz (<I>New York Dada:
Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabia</I> [Munich: Prestel-Verlag and St&auml;dtische
Galerie im Lenbachhaus, 1973], 193) quote this phrase without noting that
it was written within the context of de Zayas' creation of the Modern
Gallery and his primary criticism of Stieglitz, namely, that Stieglitz
stifled healthy commercial opportunity. Both dismiss de Zayas as "merely
an art dealer" once he and Stieglitz have gone their separate ways.

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT32" HREF="#REF32">32</A>.
Picabia himself says as much in his interview with the <I>New York
Tribune</I>: he attributes his new mechanomorphic style to his realization
upon coming to America and seeing New York that "the genius of the modern
world is in machinery"; Picabia, like Duchamp, believed America was
"destined to become the center of modern art" (<I>FP,</I> 76).

<P>
<a NAME="FOOT33" HREF="#REF33">33</A>.
The Modern Gallery was the first uptown gallery devoted to modern
art, and lasted three years. According to de Zayas, Eugene Meyer was the
principal investor, with Haviland and Picabia also contributing. Meyer
insisted on a no returns policy, so buyers were limited to the experienced
collectors Arthur B. Davies, John Quinn, and Walter Arensberg (<I>HWW,</I>
94). Picabia and his wife Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia supplied much of the
art, both from their own collection and from Paris contacts (<I>FP,</I>
76). See <I>HWW,</I> 134-55, for a complete list of The Modern and
De Zayas Galleries' exhibits.

This view of America was especially widespread in the period preceding
surrealism (prior to 1924). Other European avant-garde res who viewed
America, particularly New York, as essentially avant-garde or modernist
include Blaise Cendrars (see, e.g., his 1912 poem "P&acirc;ques &agrave;
New York"), Arthur Cravan, John Heartfield, and Hannah H&ouml;ch.

Anglo-America's superior economic and technological development
in comparison to that of the Continent was a point of pride among
Anglo-American avant-gardists, and a rallying point around which they
sometimes centered their efforts to promote their work. See Wyndham
Lewis, in the opening manifesto of <I>BLAST 1</I> (1914 [reprint
Santa Rosa: Black Sparrow Press, 1989], 39), and Ezra Pound in the
essay "Patria Mia" (1913, reprinted in Ezra Pound, <I>Selected Prose
1909-1965</I>, ed. William Cookson [New York: New Directions, 1973],
99-141). Both argue that England and America are ideally suited to be
the world leaders in modern art because everyday life in those countries
is already thoroughly structured by modern realities, particularly the
manufacture of machinery (for Lewis) and entrepreneurialism and the
industry-driven construction of steel-beamed buildings (for Pound).

Transgressive representations of the body--envisaged as means of realizing
corporeal fantasies, enacting empathetic identifications (or refusing
them), as well as reimagining the phenomenological relation of self and
world--appear with startling frequency in the works of many avant-garde
artists at the turn of the last century. One thinks of the impossible
profusion of res that populate Rodin's <I>Gates of Hell,</I> many
of them multiples without predetermined meaning, C&eacute;zanne's late
bathers with their occasionally indeterminate gender and unfixing of
somatic boundaries, Matisse's arcadian fantasies, or Picasso's protocubist
and cubist nudes, in which the signifiers of gender are at times withheld
or rendered ambiguous, and in which the body's fluctuating tactile
presence is linked to that of the material substratum of the canvas. While
central to the prewar period, the body reconred though the lens of
desire seems progressively absent or displaced in avant-garde art after
war; it seems to wither in an age dominated by technological enthusiasms
and dada irony, purist abstraction, and nostalgic returns of normative,
classicizing archetypes. Of course there 
<b></b>
are exceptions; but the
appeal to empathetic bodily sensation and gesture, which retains at least
the memory of anatomical and psychic experience, when it survives, does
so in greatly altered forms.

<P>
By casting a retrospective gaze onto one particular moment in the
representation of the body, that of Italian Futurism, I hope to elucidate
the psychic tensions and aporias that generated its appearance and
eventual (willed) disappearance. For the signs of faltering confidence in
the organic realization of somatic desire are already at work in Futurist
images and descriptions of the body--especially the male body. The
Futurist ideal of masculinity, best exemplified by the literary works
and manifestos of F. T. Marinetti and the pictorial and sculptural works
of Umberto Boccioni, differs, of course, from that of its historical
counterparts in other countries. Yet many of the issues raised were
of vital concern to artists and poets elsewhere: How best to affirm
virility while becoming free of the debilitating effects of desire? How
to imagine the body's boundaries--as both permeable, shifting, and open
to fusion with the environment, and as rigid, closed, and resistant to
penetration? How to hold in solution a narcissistic longing for expansion
of the ego and fantasies of omnipotence, with their seeming negation, a
longing to overcome subject/object distinctions in a corporeal fusion with
matter/mother? How to respond to the body's temporality, its inevitable
mortality, and reversion to (mere) matter? And finally, how to create
(and believe in) an immortal man/machine hybrid, a body always already
posited in the future tense?

<P>
In his literary manifestos of 1912, 1913, and 1914, Marinetti repeatedly
advocated the death of the literary "I" or authorial self, that "obsessive
I that up to now the poets have described, sung, analysed, and vomited
up."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Rather than project human emotions and preoccupations
onto nature, poets were to express the life of matter in its molecular
composition and movement, to intuit "its different governing impulses,
its forces of compression, dilation, cohesion, and disaggregation, its
crowds of massed molecules and whirling electrons" ("TM," 87).
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

Marinetti's emphasis on the "life" of matter was intended to obliterate
traditional distinctions between the organic and the inorganic, between
sentient beings and the physical and mechanical world. He sought, in
poetry but also in art and in politics, to open a new field in which a
chiasmic exchange of properties and attributes might occur. The Futurist
male, "multiplied" by the machine, would exemplify a new superhuman hybrid
adapted to the demands of speed and violence. Sportsman, aviator, or
warrior, he would be capable of astounding feats of physical prowess. His
inner consciousness, modeled on the running motor, would be emptied of
all that was private, sentimental, and nostalgic--of all that in 1913
Marinetti called "psychology"--which he deemed a "dirty thing and a dirty
word."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Machines, in an inverse movement, would become the
locus of all rejected human capabilities and drives, including libidinal
desire and procreation. According to the poet, "motors . . . are truly
mysterious. . . . They have whims, unexpected fantasies. They seem to
have personalities, souls, or wills. . ." Marinetti further asserts
that if treated respectfully, caressed, and never overtaxed, the machine
will give back "much more and much better than the calculations of its

<b></b>
builder--its father!--made provisions for."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Ultimately,
then, the motor will obey its master. Once fused with the machine, with
wings sprouting from his very flesh, the new Futurist male will be able
to externalize his will without resistence, achieving each of his desires
while reigning over space and time.

<I>First Record</I> (Premier Record), a free-word collage poem of 1916
dedicated to the Italian aviator Guido Guidi, exemplifies Marinetti's
fantasy of "mechanical splendor" and its attendant ambiguities
(<A HREF="4.3poggi_1.html">
 1</A>). Whereas Guidi had established a new world 
<b></b>
record by
flying to an altitude of 7,950 meters, Marinetti's poem res forth
the expansion of an heroic but impersonal self (moi + moi + moi + moi),
in the process of breaking an entire series of world records. Appearing
simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as conquering
the North Pole, Marinetti's multiplied hero achieves each of his
victories by annexing the explosive energy of a machine or racehorse. The
various selves who direct and dominate these powerful vehicles are also
transformed by them. Marinetti emphasizes the fusion of man and machine,
flesh and metal, by defining the self as a carburetor minus eight grains
of sand--that is, without the danger of malfunctioning that sand would
cause. Propelled by a mixture of gasoline and attention, and with the
further addition of good luck, the hero-as-carburetor overcomes his
merely human state in order to embody a Nietzschean ideal of superhuman
courage and triumphant force.

<P>
In celebrating record-breaking as an end in itself, Marinetti departs
from the ideology of the emerging industrial bourgeoisie in Italy. As
Jeffrey Schnapp has observed, Marinetti's body/machine complex does not
correspond to the ideals of efficient expenditure, predictablity, and
standardization currently being devised in the domain of scientific
work management (Taylorism).
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Instead, his hybrid of man
and machine is described as a "centaur"; a capricious machine capable
of dazzling feats of heroism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Liberated from the struggle
for existence, the energy he expends is sheer surplus. What Marinetti
calls the "pure idea of the ascensional record" is a manifestation of
this freedom from utilitarian productivity.

Here comparison with Francis Picabia's <I>The Child Carburetor</I> of
1919 proves instructive (<A HREF="4.3poggi_2.html">
 2</A>). Picabia's carburetor is an enigmatic
apparatus, a mechanical 
<b></b>
instrument that has usurped human functions
while emptying them of subjectivity. The artist's earlier machine works,
including <I>Girl Born without a Mother</I> and <I>Young Girl in a State
of Nudity</I> (a precisely rendered image of a spark plug), both of
1915, make the erotic association of women and machines explicit. They
also reveal Picabia's obsessive fantasy of autonomous reproduction, of
procreation without women. Similarly born of man alone, <I>The Child
Carburetor</I> mocks human desire by equating sexual union with the
pulsing motion of the piston within a cylinder, driven by a coupling of
gas and air. Yet as in Marcel Duchamp's bachelor machines, the longed-for
combustion fails to occur, here thwarted by a spherical migraine. The
various mechanical parts remain disjunct and curiously static against
the woodgrain ground, as if laid out for inspection on a table prior
to assembly.

<P>
Although not without humor, Marinetti's work exhibits none of Picabia's
biting irony. Whereas <I>The Child Carburetor</I> displaces the human
subject, <I>First Record</I> celebrates triumphant self-transcendence,
ubiquity in time and space symbolizing invincibility and a godlike
omniscience. Both works retain a reference to nature, or the organic
world of materials, as the necessary counterpoint of their mechanical
being. For it seems that nature, and the feminine with which it is
conflated, cannot be suppressed without leaving a palpable trace. A
wooden panel functions as the flat, literal ground for Picabia's
painting; seemingly unformed and primal, it invites the artist's
hallucinatory reveries. The mechanical forms he depicts on its surface
are given a similarly literal presence and color with the addition of
metallic paint. In an open letter of 1920, Picabia directs his viewers
to seek the explanation of his work in the physical rather than in the
psychological domain. "Magnetic ions" he remarks, perhaps not entirely
seriously, have determined the "equation of the sexes," for the human
brain is a powerful "magnetic field" in rapport with other naturally
occuring magnetic phenomena. For this reason, Picabia asserts, his use
of metallic paint should not be viewed as merely ornamental, but as
having special significance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Like Marinetti, he seeks to
link the activity of the mind to purely physical forces while retaining
a fundamentally vitalist and irrational attitude toward matter. Sexual
desire, according to this antihumanist view, springs from the involuntary
interactions of insentient (or para-sentient) metallic substances and
the force field generated by the earth, and therefore remains utterly
devoid of subjective or sentimental value.

<P>
While fantasizing a similarly nonsentimentalized eros, Marinetti
never entirely rejected voluntarism, or the realization of desire as
a manifestation of power over nature. In <I>L'Alcova d'acciaio</I>
(The Steel Alcove) of 1921, a first person "romanzo vissuto" (lived
novel) recounting Marinetti's experiences during the last months of
the war, the poet proclaimed: "I believe that the audacious will
to win is a force that projects itself out from the muscles with
enormous impetus and force" (<I>ADA,</I> 138).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 And in
"The New Religion-Morality of Speed," published in 1916 shortly before
<I>First Record,</I> he described the evolution of mankind's domination
of nature as the acquisition of an "army of slaves": "From space man
stole electricity and combustible fuels to transform motors into faithful
allies. Man forced vanquished metals, rendered flexible with fire, to ally
themselves with the fuels and electricity. He thus 

assembled an army
of slaves, hostile and dangerous, but sufficiently tamed to transport him
rapidly over the curves of the Earth."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Despite Marinetti's
injunction against personifying or sentimentalizing natural phenomena,
the earth assumes a distinctly "feminine" character in this and many other
Marinettian texts. Comprising unequal terrains, valleys alternating with
mountains, and with roads following irregular and indolent rivers, the
earth offers no straight lines or level planes conducive to speed. Yet
this might still be corrected. The poet declares that he hopes "to see
in the near future the Danube course at 300 km. per hour in a straight
line. One must persecute, lash, and torture all those who sin against
speed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>


<P>
If the literal ground of <I>The Child Carburetor</I> is a wooden panel,
the depicted ground in <I>First Record</I> is the earth itself, for the
work is organized as if it were a map with the North Pole at the top and
the Atlantic stretched across the center. Given this structural logic, it
is not coincidental that flight, a triumph of technology and a metaphor
of freedom from a (feminine) earthbound condition, becomes a dominant
motif. In a text titled "Electrical War," Marinetti imagines a future in
which only freight trains will still creep along the earth. "Man, having
become airborne, sets foot there only once in a while!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

In contrast, Picabia's <I>Child </I>envisions not a future of limitless
freedom, but its destruction--at least insofar as the future is associated
with the conquests of technology. The words "Detruire le future" (destroy
the future), which Picabia has inscribed on the painting's surface, seem
to mock Futurism and its enthusiasm for destroying the past.

<P>
Marinetti's fantasized fusion of the machine and the male body, while
obviously a product of his intoxication with power and freedom from
utility, also reveals a fetishistic impulse. Precisely because nature
is understood as the locus of the feminine and the maternal, it must
be opposed and displaced by both the machine, and its symbolic ally,
matter (sheer dynamic physicality). Marinetti, I will argue, imagines
matter as a vector of speed, a volatile, masculine substitute for a
nature still construed as predominantly horizontal, gravity bound, and
organic--inextricably linked, that is, to cycles of gestation, birth,
maturation, and death. Caught in this cyclic temporality, nature can
never propel Marinetti into the future, nor become the vehicle of a
new, quasi-inorganic (and therefore immortal) masculine subject. Of
course, this displacement proves unstable, and occasionally the
feminine associations of nature (including the "lack" it embodies)
return to contaminate matter, reminding us of what has been refused,
or repressed. For the most part, however, the concept of matter is
remarkably "productive." It allows Marinetti to confound the organic
and the mechanical, the procreative, and the industrial, and thereby
to seize for himself the illusory power of male autogenesis. Hence the
sexual ambiguity that structures Marinetti's desire for, and identity
with, the machine.

<P>
The system of oppositions and substitutions at work here can be elucidated
by an examination of the narrative account of the birth of Futurism
in Marinetti's "The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism" of 1909. The
story opens with a description of the poet and his friends; they have
stayed up all night arguing and writing frenetically within a lush,
oriental interior, a space redolent of nineteenth century decadence

<b></b>
and its obsession with enervating sensual pleasures. Having at
last "trampled [their] atavistic ennui" and broken with logic, awake
and standing erect, they burst forth into the street, galvanized by the
"famished roar of automobiles." The text continues: "We went up to the
three snorting beasts, to lay amorous hands on their torrid breasts. I
stretched out on my car like a corpse on its bier, but revived at
once under the steering wheel, a guillotine blade that threatened my
stomach."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Embodying an archetypal myth of femininity, the
automobiles are simultaneously associated with life and death, a compliant
responsiveness, and the threat of castration. Menaced by the guillotine
blade of the steering wheel, Marinetti revives, recovering his male
prowess. As he puts it, "We had nothing to make us wish for death" for
"we had no ideal Mistress raising her divine form to the clouds, not
any cruel Queen to whom to offer our cadavers. . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 The
automobiles themselves redress this feminine absence and allow their
masters to escape the debilitating--even life-threatening--effects of
relations with idealized women.

<P>
This preliminary scene sets the stage for the core event of the story, a
collision, in which Marinetti's car, confronted suddenly by two wobbling
cyclists, who symbolize the impasse of the old logic, overturns into a
ditch. Here is Marinetti's ironically rhapsodic prose:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Oh! Maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair factory drain! I
gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I remembered the blessed black
breast of my Sudanese nurse. . . . When I came up--torn, filthy, and
stinking--from under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy
deliciously pass through my heart! ["FMF," 48-49]
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In this narrative, the collision of past and future res as a traumatic
event, a symbolic death and rebirth, in which a factory drain substitutes
for the mother's body, and industrial sludge nourishes the infant. This
tale draws on Marinetti's memories of his childhood in Egypt, the breast
providing the muddy water reminding him of his Sudanese nurse. Maternal
functions are here conflated with those of the colonized other, and
both are superceded by the technological. This deliberate confusion
of identities serves both to feminize and to eroticize technology, so
that when a crowd of bystanders fish his car out of the ditch, a caress
from the poet is enough to revive it. It is Marinetti who now restores
his "beautiful shark" to life, thereby becoming her father as well as
her lover. Shorn of her "heavy framework of good sense" and her "soft
upholstery of comfort," the automobile is reborn as a hard, dynamic
form, a violent projectile into the future ("FMF," 49).
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>

Thrillingly phallic in shape and power, but feminine in allure and
identity, the automobile becomes a fetish, a locus of transposed desire.

Marinetti describes guns, locomotives, and even the armored tank
he commanded during the first world war in similar terms. In "The
Battle of Tripoli" he equates his machine-gun with a femme fatale:
"Ah yes! you, little machine gun, are a fascinating woman, and
sinister, and divine, at the driving wheel of an invisible hundred
horsepower, roaring and exploding with impatience" (quoted in "TM,"
94).
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In "Multiplied Man and the Reign of the Machine,"
Marinetti asks, "Have you never 

seen mechanics lovingly washing
the great powerful body of their locomotive? This is the minute,
knowing tenderness of a lover caressing his adored mistress" ("MM,"
98).
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Similarly, <I>L'Alcova</I> <I>d'acciaio</I> returns
obsessively to descriptions of lieutenant Marinetti's amorous relation
to his armored car number 74, equipped with equally feminized artillery
(<A HREF="4.3poggi_3.html">
 3</A>). In a parody of literary texts that eulogize the unique,
ideal woman, Marinetti asks: "Haven't you met my new mistress? I will
introduce you. You understand, the one I prefer, who will exclude
all others and be perhaps definitive. . . . My 74 has the health of
iron, or rather steel, and a marvelous sensitivity, but armoured." The
poet admits that she is much like her sisters, "But mine is the most
agile of all. She has the strongest heart-motor, and the fire of her
ironic artillery has neither weaknesses nor distractions" (<I>ADA,</I>
52).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Elsewhere the text compares her artillery fire to
"a furious dance," whose "ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta" is "capricious, ruthless,
ironic and feminine," although she always remains loyal to Marinetti
(<I>ADA,</I> 19).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 This eroticized relation of man to his
machines, indeed to his weapons, solves a problem inadvertantly introduced
by the negation of women and of their reproductive capability: How to
maintain a myth of heterosexual virility in a world without women?

<P>
The topos of autogenesis through the union of man and machine, so
important in "The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism," also provides the
narrative impetus for Marinetti's 1909 novel, <I>Mafarka le Futuriste</I>
(Marfarka the Futurist). This novel, like the opening scene of the
founding manifesto, draws on the author's memories of North Africa, and
its eponymous hero is an Arabian king with imperialist ambitions. When
Mafarka's 
<b></b>
beloved brother dies, he creates a mechanical son,
Gazurmah, to be his immortal substitute. Carved out of oak, Gazurmah is
nonetheless modeled on an airplane; his enormous, resplendently orange
cloth wings are stretched over a lattice composed of steel, bamboo and
hippopotomous sinew. With his coarse skin, squared jaw, ribs of iron, and
formidable metallic member, Marfarka finds his creation beautiful. He
breathes life into his son with a dangerously homoerotic, lingering
kiss on the lips, and is then thrown to his death by his impatient,
newly born progeny--a fate he has forseen and even desired so that he
might be reborn in the immortal Gazurmah. It is this early example of a
cyborg, generated without the aid of what the novel calls a "vulva," who
eventually fulfills his father's dreams by raping and obliterating the
earth. The novel's project, as Barbara Spackman has argued, is to bypass
the "vulva" and fertilize what Marinetti calls an "unused ovary" with a
male spirit.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 The fruit of his father's will, Gazurmah is
"beautiful and pure of all the defects that come from the maleficent
vulva and that predispose one to decrepitude and death! . . . Yes, you
are immortal, my son" (<I>MIF,</I> 303).
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Marfarka renders
the dual aspiration for autogenesis and immortality--and the attendant
demonization of woman's bodies--explicit when he triumphantly discovers
that "it is possible to procreate an immortal giant from one's own flesh,
without concourse and stinking complicity with woman's womb" (<I>MIF,</I>
237).
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The misogyny of this text is an effect of a prior
rejection of merely human, abject corporeality and hence, of mortality,
which Marinetti projects onto femininity. The frantic anxiety driving
this attempt at male autarchy is apparent even to Mafarka, who tells his
nascent son: "I created you thus with all the force of my desperation,
for the intensity of creative energy is measured by the magnitude of
the desperation that generates it" (<I>MIF,</I> 313-14).

<P>
A fragment from Marinetti's diary of 31 March 1917, a time when he was
still on active military duty, reveals a similar ambivalent comingling of
erotic pleasure, violent fantasy, and disgust with the female body. Most
significant is the way his identity as a soldier stands in opposition
to, and ultimately destroys, the possibility of sexual pleasure with a
woman. Here virilty is affirmed through military violence rather than
through erotic or sensual activity.

ear to catch a distant, imaginary shelling. Nostalgia, desire for heroism

<P>
In this passage, Marinetti's desire for military heroism and violence
tear him away from the arms of his lover, interrupting the flow of
sexual passion and introducing a torrid nostalgia. The imagined sounds of
distant shellings further transfer Marinetti from the edge of the bed to
the "muddy broth" of a trench created by the shellings--a "trench" that
tropes the female genitals. It is lust itself that these violent fantasies
kill, through the imagined destruction of the lover's body. From this
trench with its 
<b></b>
muddy broth, which recalls the factory drain and
its muddy water in the collision scene of "The Founding and Manifesto of
Futurism," climbs a "monstrous ivy" of naked female bodies. Assimilated
to a vegetal state, these bodies ascend to the moon, the oft-rejected
symbol of sentimental love in Marinetti's oeuvre. The horror of this
scene exceeds the seemingly rational denial of both love and lust in
many of the poet's writings. By reducing "the immense <I>Amore</I> of
the romantics" to the simple need to conserve the species, and sexuality
to a casual "friction of the epidermis," Marinetti also erects a barrier
against the pleasures of the body ("MM," 100).
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>


<P>
Klaus Theweleit, in his study of the psychic structure of fascist
soldier males in Germany, has identified a similar impulse to negate
sensual pleasure by recourse to violent acts or fantasies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

For these men, as for Marinetti, the war red as the ideal arena in
which to experience the relation of body and world. Only in war could
they be the source of, or somehow connected to, every explosion, without
risking the disintegration of their fragile egos. Apart from war, the
soldier males Theweleit analyzed organize their lives on the model of
severe military discipline and maintain relationships primarily with
other men within a strict hierarchical order. By disciplining the body,
rendering it hard and nearly metallic, they create a kind of protective
armor designed to shield them from their fear of dissolution. This fear
emanates from the sense of an inner void, or lack of psychic coherence,
which is then projected outward. Often it takes the threatening form
of a miasma associated with both femininity and the unruly proletarian
masses. The texts Theweleit analyzes frequently describe this miasma
as bloody, oozing, a viscous liquid with the power to contaminate,
overwhelm, or destroy whatever it comes into contact with. The creation
of body armor is designed to render the fascist soldier male resistent to
this contagion, but also, and perhaps most importantly, serves to render
him impervious to sensual or erotic pleasure. For sexual communion with
another implies the breaching of both psychic and corporeal boundaries.

<P>
For the Fascist soldier male, desire may be released only in the moment
of destruction or annihilation of the other--the moment of firing a
machine gun, throwing a grenade, or dropping a bomb. This outward
eruption provides a surfeit of sensations in which the rifleman,
for example, imagines himself as a bullet, hurtling through space to
penetrate the enemy. He desires, not union with the enemy, but its
utter obliteration. As Theweleit explains, he explodes <I>against</I>
the enemy, in a movement that allows his body to atomize as it erupts
outwards.Yet this seeming disintegration ultimately serves to strengthen
his body-ego--like a gun that explodes in a powerful discharge of
energy but remains whole.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 A similar attitude drives many of
Marinetti's corporeal fantasies, revealing a profound desire to experience
the body as a ballistic weapon, to render it both an explosive force and
impervious to attack. "Let's Murder the Moonshine" of 1909 proclaims:
"It is necessary--do you understand?--necessary for the soul to launch
the body in flames, like a fireship, against the enemy, the eternal enemy
that we would have to invent if it didn't exist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 This
text continues to describe the "furious" pleasure of war as a form of
coitus to which even the feminized, "informe" (miasmic) enemy abandons
herself: "See the furious 
<b></b>
coitus of war, gigantic vulva stirred by
the friction of courage, informe vulva that rips itself open the better
to offer itself to the terrifying spasm of the next victory! It's ours,
the victory. . .of that I'm sure, because the madmen are already hurling
their hearts toward heaven, like bombs!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<P>
Indeed the ballistic metaphor pervades Marinetti's wartime writings. In
<I>L'Alcova d'acciaio</I> Marinetti compares his body to a grenade about
to be inserted into a launcher (<I>ADA,</I> 118), while he dedicates
<I>Come si seducono le donne</I> (How to seduce women), written in 1916,
to the Austrian grenade that wounded him, adorning his face and legs
with "the only tatoos worthy of we Futurists."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Turning
the same reifying glance on himself that he elsewhere cast upon his
enemies, Marinetti regards his burnt and bleeding flesh as if it were an
aesthetic phenomenon seen from a distance: "Wounded in the groin by a
large piece of schrapnel, fallen under the heap of stones and sandbags
of the dazzling battery, I rose up with a burnt face and taking off my
blood-soaked trousers, I admired the extraordinary violet of my thighs
and of my battered knee" (<I>ADA,</I> 118).
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 It is this
ability to desensitize the body, to experience it as pure exteriority,
that allows Marinetti simultaneously to treat it as a weapon and to
marvel at its wounds. If there appears to be an element of masochism
in this open display of battered and "tatooed" flesh, it serves only
to reaffirm Marinetti's control of his own bodily sensations and his
pleasure in withstanding the enemy's assault.

<P>
While arguing that Theweleit's analysis of the libidinal structure
typical of the German fascist soldier serves to elucidate a similar
structure in the Futurist male, I nevertheless wish to point to certain
differences. Perhaps because Marinetti was above all a poet and member of
an international avant-garde, and retained a certain romantic allegiance
to anarchist ideals of individual liberty and spontaneity, his body armor
remained provisional and fragmentary. It might be assumed, but could
also be cast off--at least temporarily. The narrative of <I>L'Alcova
d'acciaio</I> is organized around a constant oscillation between his
desire for women and his desire for military heroism. Arriving in Naples
for a tryst with Bianca, Marinetti observes: "a battle had broken out
between my wilfull brain full of ideas of war and of the next offensive,
and my trembling heart, vanquished, liquified, Neapolitan. Extremely
irritated, upset, with tears in my throat, I reeled in the cab as
it jolted along nocturnal alleys" (<I>ADA,</I> 103).
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

Surprisingly, in this case his love for Bianca triumphs and the exhausted
soldier cedes his will to a woman. He experiences this reversal of ideals
as a defeat and remarks ironically, "An absurd demon forces me to degrade
myself, to annihilate myself. Perhaps I have suffered too much from the
exuberant fullness of strength and of constricting rigidity" (<I>ADA,</I>
109).
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 At this point Bianca assumes Marinetti's Futurist
spirit and refuses his offer of marriage, explaining that he is her second
lover, and that she will marry the first. Significantly, all the women
Marinetti encounters in the novel have had previous lovers and he remains
singularly unconcerned about their virginity or their faithfulness. In
this he diverges sharply from the attitudes of the fascist soldiers
analyzed by Theweleit. Nor does Marinetti admire discipline and military
hierarchy for their own sake, seeing in them a threat to the intuitive
elan, elasticity, and pride of the Italian character.
<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 31]</b>


<P>
The novel closes with a speech to a captured Austrian colonel and his
"niece" Rosa, in which Marinetti explains that the Italians were
victorious in the war because of innate national differences. For
Marinetti, German military "preparedness" and force could never triumph
over Italian spiritual elasticity and improvisatory genius. (In the
light of such self-proclaimed racial stereotypes, Boccioni's painting
<I>Elasticity</I> of 1912, depicting a dynamically rendered male on
horseback, might be compared with Arno Breker's 1937 bronze sculpture
of a classically inspired male warrior titled <I>Preparedness.</I>) He
further exemplifies this national, indeed racial, contrast by refusing
to carry off the seductive Rosa, despite his "rights" as a conquerer,
thereby demonstrating the moral superiority of Italian civilization. But
by this time the war has been won, and he has already spent the previous
night in the arms of a divine woman--a personified Italy who submits to
his embrace in the clean, shining quarters of a steel alcove, the armored
tank number 74. Whereas Mafarka and his son had represented the type of
the nomadic warrior, a pure upsurge of destructive power alien to the laws
and institutions of any state, in <I>L'Alcova d'acciaio</I> Marinetti
fuses his militarism with the patriotic goals of Italy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

This demands a corresponding transformation of the earth itself, from
an unmarked, deterritorialized feminine ground, to the delimited and
embodied territory of the nation. "The elegant roseate form vibrates on
the map! No longer map, she is incarnated" (<I>ADA,</I> 195).
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

Only in this mythic form does Marinetti penetrate her (via his armored car
number 74, in whom he now sees lesbian tendencies), addressing Italy thus:
"The virile impetus of this my motor which is also heart, sex, inspired
genius and artistic volition, enter you, with rough pleasure for you,
for me, I feel it! I am the extremely powerful Futurist genius/sex of
your race, your favorite male who gives you a refertilizing vibration
in penetrating you" (<I>ADA,</I> 195).
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 But this "rough"
embrace of Italy implies a recognition of the modern state's laws and
moral codes, including, surprisingly, Christian forgiveness. Marinetti
articulates the duality of his new identity at the close of the war
by pointing to the coexistence of primitive and civilized qualities
within himself: "Extravagant primitivism of my temperament, virgin,
wild, sincere, elastic, full of cruel barbarisms and of a profound,
civilized humanity. A temperament that hurls itself forward, strikes,
but immediately understands and forgives all, with a lofty, indulgent and
tranquil goodness" (<I>ADA,</I> 225).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 This text predicts the
fate of Futurism in the postwar period, which would cede its will, not
so much to women or romantic desire, as to the state and its authority.

Among the Futurist artists, Umberto Boccioni was most closely
associated with Marinetti during the prewar period. Like the poet,
Boccioni was obsessed with the idea of expressing the "life" of matter
in his art. Paintings such as the 1912 <I>Materia</I> (Matter--but also
mother, measurable substance, and the first product of creation: chaos)
posit a continuity on the level of molecular structure between the human
body and the objects of the world (<A HREF="4.3poggi_4.html">
 4</A>). As a result of the inherent
dynamism of matter, which Boccioni following Henri Bergson calls "absolute
motion," all objects interpenetrate each other, shattering the apparently
closed boundaries of individual forms as they follow the trajectories of
their development in space. Only individuals 
<b></b>
endowed with superior
intuitive power can detect the spontaneous forces of objects that propel
them to fuse with their environments.

As we have seen, in Marinetti's texts matter functions as a kind of
antinature; it both displaces and substitutes for a nature still invested
with sentimental feminine attributes. The situation in Boccioni's case is
more ambiguous. In <I>Materia</I> the monumentalized form of Boccioni's
mother serves to equate primal matter with motherhood, so that matter at
first seems to retain its traditional feminine associations of generative
potential. Yet Boccioni's mother is invaded by the energized forces
of the street, which penetrate the domestic interior she inhabits and
represents. In an earlier meditation on this theme, <I>The Street Enters
the House</I> of 1911 (<A HREF="4.3poggi_5.html">
 5</A>), Boccioni depicts his mother leaning
over a balcony to observe the dynamic activity of men constructing
the foundation of a modern factory. Her head and upper body plunge into

<b></b>
the vortex of the scene before her, so that she seems to collaborate
in the interpenetration of interior and exterior forces. This posture
is replicated by that of several other women who also lean out from
nearby balconies to observe the men at work, the masculinity of their
sphere underscored by the vertical poles that provide its emblematic
scaffolding. In a later version of 1912, <I>Horizontal Construction</I>
(<A HREF="4.3poggi_6.html">
 6</A>), Boccioni again situates his mother in the liminal space of
a balcony, but turns her so that she faces the interior. She no longer
views or participates in the activity of urban life, but submits to its
dislocations and transformations. Moreover, his mother's vision is now
fractured along a central faultline, yielding a synthesis of profile and
frontal aspects, one that suggests not her own multiplied visual power,
but that of the artist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 The horizontality of this painting's
title alludes to the organization of its volumes rather than to its
format, which is square, and may be an attribute associated by Boccioni
with his mother/matter's newly passive status. A drawing (<A HREF="4.3poggi_7.html">
 7</A>),
related to both <I>Materia</I> and to <I>Horizontal Construction,</I>
probably reveals a preliminary stage in 
<b></b>
Boccioni's exploration
of the formal and symbolic meanings of horizontality as a property of
matter. Its lateral organization ultimately proved unsatisfactory, perhaps
because it reduced the view of the city beyond the balcony and confined
the dynamically penetrating elements, the galloping horse and balcony
railings, to a horizontal trajectory that failed to suggest virile force.

<P>
How can we explain the apparent change in the artist's depiction of his
mother, in particular, his inability to equate his own act of omnipotent
looking with that of his mother? I would like to suggest that it was
prompted by conversations with Marinetti or a reading of his text
"Multiplied Man and the Reign of the Machine," in which we find the
following passage: "Thus we will see disappear, not only love for the
woman-spouse and for the woman-lover, but also love for the mother,
principal support of the family and as such opposed to the audacious
creation of the man of the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Perhaps Marinetti's
rejection of the cult of the mother reawakened Boccioni's own earlier
anxieties about matter, his recurring uncertainty over the selection of
an appropriate medium for a given subject, and his fear of resulting
chaos. In this context, 
<b></b>
the artist had once written: "It is the
terror of matter that suffocates me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
Whatever the reasons,
during the summer of 1912, Boccioni returns temporarily to a hylomorphic
model in which form and matter, spirit and substance, constitute opposing
if complementary terms. Paradoxically, it was this form/matter duality
that Marinetti had sought to negate by positing an energized matter with
its own inherent properties of propulsion and diffusion.

<I>Materia</I> is closely related to <I>Horizontal Construction,</I>
except in its format which is decidedly vertical.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Sitting
with her overly large, coarse hands clasped before her, Boccioni's
mother seems like so much raw matter waiting to be imbued with an active
(male) spirit. Force lines emanating from the orthogonals of the distant
buildings partially dissolve and fragment her massive form, while a
nude, swift and male at right, and a lunging horse at left, traverse the
scene at the level of the balcony. Horses, along with the men who ride
or guide them, had already appeared as allegorical res in <I>The
City Rises</I> of 1910, which Boccioni had titled <I>Gli Uomini</I>
(The men) and <I>Lavoro</I> (Work) in preliminary studies. The studies
reveal that in the course of articulating his vision of the city under
construction--the scenes depict the archetypally modern erection of
an electric plant--Boccioni evidently embraced Marinetti's exaltation
of speed and dynamism as the free, nonutilitarian expression of the
will to power.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Accordingly he had shorn his horses of
their harnesses and replaced them with wings. If the harness returns
in <I>Materia,</I> it is because the nature of work, of mind infusing
matter with form, is once again at stake. The small scale of the horse and
man is also noteworthy, implying their objective physical distance from
this interior, which they have nonetheless breached. (In <I>Horizontal
Construction,</I> which lacks these res, Boccioni experiments with
simply writing distance onto the trajectory of invading force-lines: 200
meters, 122 meters, etc.) Significantly, this is one of the few examples
of centripetal motion in Boccioni's work; in most cases, as in <I>The
Development of a Bottle in Space,</I> also of 1912 (<A HREF="4.3poggi_8.html">
 8</A>), the opened
core of the bottle suggests that a centrifugal force propels itself out
from and around a centered, stable object to join with the environment,
including a dish, table, and even a house in the distance. In the terms
established by <I>Materia,</I> it is the vertical, masculine forces of
the street, emblematic of the dynamism and modernity of city life, that
penetrate a feminine personification of matter, in order to obliterate the
distinction between interior and exterior, human being and urban world.

<P>
Only the hands of Boccioni's mother appear to counter this collapse
of boundaries. Their uncanny proximity and gnarled forms verge on
the grotesque, telling of his mother's age and years of manual labor
as a seamstress. Insofar as they seem shaped by her own work, her own
temporal experience, Cecilia Forlani's hands resist the disintegration
visited upon the rest of her form. Still imposing, though at rest, these
hands clearly captivated Boccioni, who made them the center and focal
point of this and related works. Their meanings exceed the logic of the
spirit/matter duality reaffirmed by <I>Materia,</I> in which it is now
the artist who dominates and transforms matter in the creation of this
very painting--and thereby implicitly engenders his own mother.

Whereas <I>Materia</I> personifies matter in the form of Boccioni's

 9</A>)
dramatizes the depersonalization of the human subject, in what might
retrospectively be called a Futurist cyborg. This sculpture strives to
represent the Nietzschean ideal of the heroic superman by representing
the dreamt of fusion of human flesh and metal. Its success lies in
its synthesis of a series of opposing qualities. The work evokes
the heat and evanescence of flame-whipped forms, as well as the cold
impenetrability of a projectile; it suggests the power of tensed human
muscles without invoking any resemblance to flesh, and it retains a sense
of balanced stability despite a fragmented exterior that appears to strive
forward. The head bears no human features; encased in a helmet and with
a cross-like projection in the place of a visage, it plies through space
like Boccioni's famous fist on the power of sheer externalized will.

<P>
In creating <I>Unique Forms of Continuity in Space,</I> Boccioni seeks
to realize Marinetti's dream of a man/machine hybrid as articulated in

<P>
Fulfilling the nonhuman ideal presented here, Boccioni's <I>Unique Forms
of Continuity in Space</I> seems all armor, the "prow" formed by the
breastbone circling around and sheathing an empty core. The paradox
of the sculpture is that volition emanates from a mechanical being
devoid of human organs and interiority; matter itself--and in particular
metal--constitutes this body without organs. For if wood is the emblem of
nature, metal is the archetype of matter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 <I>Unique Forms of

physical properties of metal, conceived as manifestations of impersonal

 The "life"of metal is thereby conceived as its
content; in its molten state, metal exemplifies fluidity, expansiveness,
becoming, but when cold and hard, it exemplifies the impervious rigidity
of pure will.

Boccioni's <I>Dynamism of a Man's Head</I> of fall 1914 (<A HREF="4.3poggi_0.html">
 10</A>),
returns to the theme of the Futurist superman, but this time the work
addresses a specific historical moment to become a vehicle of prowar
propaganda. The artist intended the diversity of materials used in this
collage--which include papers of different weight and texture, as well
as ink, oil and gouache--to produce a physical effect of conflict and
motion and thus to convey a sense of the man's dynamic state of mind. Yet
just as the emphasis on contrasting and overlapping materials suggests a
synthesis of re and ground, of man and environment, the introduction
of newspaper suggests the collapse of any distinction between a subjective
state of mind and a public discourse. Fragments of newspaper text remain
legible beneath patches of gouache and ink, and they speak of patriotic
fervor, a desire for war and for acts of cruelty. From the text that lies
across the man's head we read: "Serbians," "Imperial," "war," "struggle,"
"Hungary," and "of the 
<b></b>
Fatherland." At the lower right, similarly
violent images are evoked: "pistol," "great cruelty," "a huge crowd of
people," "fear," and "anger." Belonging at once to the public domain
of state propaganda and to the man's inner consciousness, the newspaper
signals the extent to which the two have merged. The individual ego thus
is both negated and multiplied as it expands in total identification
with the fatherland and its imperialist goals. As in <I>Materia,</I> the
boundary between the interior and the public domain is breached, so that
all becomes exteriority, and consciousness is constructed from without.

<P>
With this collage we return to the leitmotif of the death of the literary
I, so often invoked in Marinetti's writings. With Italy's entry into the
war in 1915, this theme took on greater urgency. In a manifesto of 1916,
Marinetti attunes his aesthetic ideals even more closely to military
attitudes, gestures, and acts by calling for a warlike, mechanical
declamation of his poetry. In order to achieve this goal, the performer
is to dress anonymously, dehumanize his voice and face, metallize or
electrify his voice, and in all ways imitate motors and their rhythms,
until ultimately, he has "disappeared." In the new Futurist lyricism,
Marinetti declares, "our literary I consumes and obliterates itself in
the grand cosmic vibration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Assimilated to the energized
world of matter, with electrical currents coursing through his veins,
his body sheathed in metal, and his actions imitating those of motors,
Marinetti longs for dispersal and disintegration--even while declaiming
his poetry. In the "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature" he dreams
of a vital art that would pour out from the forest of his veins, "beyond
the body, into the infinity of space and time" ("TM," 97).
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>

Only by imagining his own imminent death, could he fantasize this final
scattering into the world of matter as an apotheosis, a triumph over
his own mortality. Within the terms of this fantasy, writing poetry,
and making art, become equivalent to the violent eruptions of war.

This interpretation takes issue with the prevalent understanding
of <I>Horizontal Construction</I> and <I>Materia</I>, which sees in
them the culmination of Boccioni's fascination with "circular" or total
vision on the part of the depicted observer, as in <I>The Street Enters
the House</I> and <I>Simultaneous Visions</I> of 1911. See, for example,
Antonello Negri, "Uno sguardo circolare," in Laura Mattioli Rossi, ed.,
<I>Boccioni 1912 Materia</I> (Milan: Fondazione Antonio Mazzotta, 1995),
27-42. I believe that whereas in the earlier works, the woman at the

the artist distinguishes his own act of viewing from that of his subject.

Boccioni's <I>Unique Forms of Continuity in Space</I> was executed
in plaster and exhibited in that form in Paris in 1913. No doubt the
artist was prevented from casting it in bronze by lack of expertise and
funds, as well as by his denunciation of bronze as a "pass&eacute;ist"
material in his "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture" dated
April 11, 1912, but not published until October of that year. Guillaume
Apollinaire urged Boccioni to cast his sculptures in bronze at the time
of the Paris exhibition and his comment was recorded by the artist in
a letter to Vico Baer of early July 1913. See Boccioni, <I>Gli scritti
editi e inediti,</I> 369. Plaster, of course, was also a traditional
material in Boccioni's eyes. I believe the plaster version was always
preliminary, and that the bronze version best achieves the artist's
intent. The posthumous castings in bronze were ordered by Marinetti.

In January 1914, an obscure London journal titled the <I>New Freewoman</I>
changed its name to the <I>Egoist.</I> In recent years, the change has
become a subject of intense debate among scholars of literary modernism,
some of whom claim that it marks a key transformation within literary
modernism itself (or at least in its Anglo-American version), a turn
away from modernism's earlier affiliations with militant feminism and
toward a more agonistic and decidedly male modernism. The work of Joyce,
who published <I>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</I> and much of
<I>Ulysses</I> in the journal, has become a crucial site for the unfolding
of this debate, in part because his affiliations with the journal were
critical to his early career and left lasting traces throughout his
work, and in part because of his undisputed status as the paradigmatic
master of modernist prose. How were the relations between modernism
and feminism played out in the change of the journal's name? What were
the gender affiliations of egoism, and how did they overlap with the
increasingly troubled status of the self and notions of modern heroism,
and in what ways were they linked with the kind of relentless linguistic
experimentalism so typically associated with Joyce? These have become
pressing questions, and I propose to reconsider them by teasing out
Joyce's complicated associations with egoism, viewed here as a set of
philosophical commitments that intersect in complex ways with contemporary
debates about gender, politics, and language.

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Joyce's irony is directed at the mixture of neo-Darwinism and feminism
that was rampant among the magazine's editors and contributors, perhaps
a reflex of his gradual move away from any form of radical politics
in the 1930s. A passage from <I>Ulysses</I> seems to confirm the idea
that Joyce identified more with the <I>Egoist</I> than with the <I>New
Freewoman</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Stephen Dedalus, locked in debate with the
librarian John Eglington, thinks to himself: "I believe, O Lord, help
my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve? Who
helps to believe? Egomen. Who to unbelieve? Other chap" (<I>U</I>,
9.1078-80). Joyce plays on the Greek <I>ego,</I> followed by the
intensive particle <I>men</I> ("really"), which, in a Platonic dialogue,
means "yes, truly." Gifford and Seidman, among others, see this as an
allusion to the <I>Egoist,</I> a journal that indeed helped Joyce "to
believe" in his work at a time when it faced the greatest difficulties
in getting published; while the "other chap," accordingly, would be
George Roberts, the publisher who hesitated to issue <I>Dubliners</I>
and finally destroyed the sheets in 1912.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>


<P>
Joyce, in fact, goes further than merely alluding to the journal; the
passage directly quotes from the leading article by Dora Marsden in the
<I>Egoist</I> of 1 August 1914, when the journal was still serializing
<I>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</I> Marsden, meditating on
the concept of "authority," deftly links together the verb "to believe"
with the notion "to leave doubt":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
. . . the voices of authority echo one to another all the world round
with the cry of "Believe, believe." They mean, "Leave decision, leave it,
leave it to us," in effect asserting that knowledge is a spurious form, a
degraded type of the ideal which is lack-of-knowledge. . . . The sacred
is indeed the first weapon of defence against the prying questions of
intelligence. . . . Very naturally, therefore, all that one believes is
by acquiescence of belief made sacred. "My beliefs are sacred," there
would be no doubt, were the decision left with the believers, but the
believer, as the history of belief shows, is encompassed about with
enemies: both from within and from without. . . . Spontaneously bursts
from him the cry: "I believe, help thou my unbelief. I have abandoned
the quest: do thou (namely, sluggishness, comfort, whatnot) smother this
itch I have to return to pry and poke."
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Both Joyce and Mardsen quote Mark 9:24 (Authorized Version), which
tells the story of the father of a possessed child who answers Jesus's
injunction: "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that
believeth." Both insert the famous phrase in a context that stresses the
value of doubt and the need to resist any authoritative 
<b></b>
injunction
to believe. Marsden develops her analysis of the "word-games" by which
authority imposes itself on individual consciences, presenting a genealogy
of the belief in morality and sin that looks extremely modern, with echoes
of Nietzsche, a bold pre-Wittgensteinian strategy, and a critical account
of the "grammar of assent" that was so dear to Cardinal Newman. Marsden's
deconstructive and anarchist semantics adumbrates her later development
of a "science of signs." It is in this context that one may reinscribe
Stephen's dialogic meditations on belief. If such an intertextual network
looks promising, I shall nevertheless try to show that one cannot equate
the <I>Egoist</I> editors with a bunch of Ego-Men and that a different
gendering of Egoism is required.

<P>
While my main interrogation touches upon the definition of Joyce as an
egoist--the term is a philosophical one, though inevitably it also retains
some of the popular connotations of "egoism"--I wish to reopen briefly
the complex issue of the journal's politics, a subject recently explored
by Bruce Clarke in <I>Dora Marsden and Early Modernism.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

Clarke's main thesis opposes the idea that the magazine's change of name
can be interpreted as the takeover of a feminist magazine by a set of
aggressively phallocratic modernists. Let me first recall a few facts.

<P>
Dora Marsden had been a classmate of Christabel Pankhurst since 1900 at
the Manchester Victoria University and remained associated with suffragism
thereafter. She was a militant member of the Women's Social and Political
Union (WSPU) and spoke at a huge rally that, in Manchester in June 1908,
drew 150,000 persons. The same year she became a salaried organizer of
the movement and captured attention with her spectacular harassment
of Winston Churchill at the Southport Empire Theater in 1909, where
she shouted propaganda from a skylight in the dome and almost fell to
her death when the police caught her. Like many militant suffragettes,
she was repeatedly jailed and force-fed through the nose. After the
infamous "Black Friday" in November 1910, when two women died by police
brutality, she was felt to be too radical in her positions and was
condemned by the Pankhursts. In 1911 she resigned from the WSPU and
founded the <I>Freewoman: A</I> <I>Weekly Feminist Review.</I> It was a
unique journal, an open forum for suffragists, feminists, anarchists,
socialists, Uranians (the gay liberation movement of the period), but
also spiritualists, currency reformers, poets, and aesthetes. But it
lasted only eleven months, collapsing in October 1912.

<P>
The journal was resuscitated under the name of the <I>New Freewoman: An
Individualist Review</I> in June 1913, opening its columns to writers such
as Rebecca West, Ezra Pound, and Richard Aldington. Six months later, in
January 1914, its name was changed to the <I>Egoist.</I> The last issue
of the <I>New Freewoman</I> anticipated the change with a brief note. "It
is proposed that with our issue of January 1st, 1914, the title of THE
NEW FREEWOMAN be changed to THE EGOIST." It also reproduced a letter
signed by five men, Upward, Pound, Carter, Kauffmann, and Aldington:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We, the undersigned men of letters who are grateful to you for
establishing an organ in which men and women of intelligence can express
themselves without regard to the public, venture to suggest to you that
the present title of the paper causes it to be confounded
<b></b>
 with organs
devoted solely to the advocacy of an unimportant reform in an obsolete
political institution. We therefore ask with great respect that you should
consider the advisability of adopting another title which will mark the
character of your paper as an organ of individualists of both sexes, and
of the individualist principle in every department of life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The letter has been read as the sign of a takeover by men who wish to
erase all traces of feminism--a takeover prepared by the famous "Imagiste"
issue of August 1913, in which Rebecca West paves the way for Pound
and his friends, and by a later issue of October 1913, in which Pound
published "The Serious Artist" and "Religio" amid features by Aldington,
Byington, Upward, and Remy de Gourmont. A male-centered modernism has
ousted and replaced an earlier and more radical feminism, according to
Rachel Blau Du Plessis, who is extremely critical of Marsden's betrayal
of feminism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 More recently, however, Bruce Clarke has shown
that it was Dora Marsden herself who engineered the change of name, even
soliciting the notorious letter from the reputed "men of letters."

<P>
Clarke's account is reinforced by a glance at the front page of the first
issue of the <I>New Freewoman.</I> The influence of Max Stirner, the
Young Hegelian philsopher whose work, <I>The Ego and His Own,</I> would
furnish the title for the <I>Egoist</I>, is unmistakable in Marsden's
first article.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This is the epoch of the gadding mind. The mind "not at home" but given
to something else, occupied with alien "causes" is the normal order and
as such must be held accountable for that contemning [<I>sic</I>] of the
lonely occupant of the home--the Self--which is the characteristic of
the common mind. . . . Hence the popularity of the "Cause" which provides
the Idol to which the desired self-sacrifice can be offered. The greater
the sacrifice the Idol can accept the greater is it as a "Cause," whether
it be liberty, equality, fraternity or what not.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Marsden's discussion of the "Cause" is directly influenced by the
opening passage of Stirner's book, which had been translated into
English in 1907 by Benjamin Tucker (who was also a regular contributor
to the <I>New Freewoman</I>). Stirner quotes the first line, "Ich hab'
mein Sach' auf Nichts gestellt," of a famous drinking poem by Goethe
("Vanitas! Vanitatum Vanitas!"), a line that can be translated as "I
have set my cause on nothing," then goes on to develop its chief idea:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
What is not supposed to be my cause [<I>Sache</I>]! First and foremost,
the Good Cause, then God's cause, the cause of mankind, of truth, of
freedom, of humanity, of justice; further, the cause of my people, my
prince, my fatherland; finally even the cause of Mind, and a thousand
other causes. Only my cause is never to be my concern. "Shame on the
egoist who thinks only of himself!"
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Stirner describes the "egoism" of those who require us to work for them,
such as the state or God, then decides to "take a lesson from them" and,
instead of serving them, to serve himself first: "God and mankind have
concerned themselves for nothing but themselves. Let me then likewise
concern myself for myself, who am equally with 
<b></b>
God the nothing of all
others, who am my all, who am the only one (der Einzige). . . . Nothing
is more to me than myself!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>


<P>
It is thanks to Stirner, as relayed via Tucker and Byington, that Dora
Marsden criticizes the way the two Pankhursts have defined suffragism as a
"Cause." "'The Cause to which I have given my life.' This is a message,
the last but one of Mrs. Pankhurst." According to Marsden, Mrs. Pankhurst
has changed; only six years earlier she would have have said simply: "I
want the vote given to me." Now she has fallen into the trap of absolute
dedication to a cause.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
She began to "lead a cause" and imperceptibly the Cause became
Leader--leading where all causes tend--"Ich hab' mein Sach' auf Nichts
gestellt," to self-annihilation. Mrs. Pankhurst may die and great is
the Cause. What Cause? The Cause of the empty concept--the fount of all
insincerity: the Cause of the Symbol--the Nothing worked upon by the
Dithyramb. ["LK," 3]

Accurately speaking, there is no "Woman movement." . . . If primarily
women are to regard themselves as Woman or as the Mother, their
satisfactions as individuals would be subordinated to an external
authority: the requirements of the development of Woman or Mother as
such--Empty concepts again. . . . The few individual women before
mentioned maintain that their only fitting description is that of
Individual: Ends-in-themselves. They are Egoists. They are autocrats
and government in their autocracy is vested in the Self which holds the
reins in the kingdom of varying wants and desires, and which defines the
resultant of these different forces as the Satisfaction of Itself. The
intensive satisfaction of Self is for the individualist the one goal in
life. ["LK," 5]

<P>
This flamboyant statement was published in the first issue of the <I>New
Freewoman,</I> which suggests that anarchism, rather than feminism,
was the journal's dominant inspiration. No wonder that one finds an
advertisement for Stirner's book, <I>The Ego and His Own</I> (with the
caption: "The most powerful work that has ever emerged from a single human
mind") amid a list of titles that includes <I>Anarchism</I> by Eltzbacher
and <I>State Socialism and Anarchism</I> by Tucker. Dora Marsden had
indeed moved from postsuffragist feminism to postfeminist anarchism,
and she was already sketching out her revolutionary deconstruction of
political discourse and everyday language, in what she later called
her "Egoist semantics." Let us thus take a closer look at her model,
Max Stirner.

<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The American translation of Stirner's book, subtitled "The Case of the
Individual Against Authority," differs somewhat in emphasis from the
original version, which in German sports a title (<I>Der Einzige und
sein Eigentum</I>) that clearly situates it among the so-called Young
Hegelians and the Berlin "free spirits." Stirner radically criticizes
and simplifies the system of Hegel's <I>Phenomenology of Spirit</I> by
distinguishing 
<b></b>
between two great periods, that of the "Ancients,"
or the world of ancient wisdom, and that of the "Moderns," which he
identifies with Christianity. Christian theology, because based upon a
mystique of transcendent love, remains a resolute adversary of egoism,
the latter being a style of thought that refuses to sacrifice personal
interest to a cause, to a generous but mystifying abstract idea. Stirner
dismisses theology as nothing but a systematic belief in ghosts, and
he energetically mimics a contemporary rhetoric shaped by the romantic
discourse of the so-called moderns:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Yes, the whole world is haunted! Only is haunted? Nay, it itself "walks,"
it is uncanny through and through, it is the wandering seeming-body of
a spirit, it is a spook. . . . Everything that appears to you is only
the phantasm of an indwelling spirit, is a ghostly "apparition" . . . to
you the whole world is spiritualized, and has become an enigmatic ghost;
therefore do not wonder if you likewise find in yourself nothing but
a spook.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Everything has become spectral in a modernity that is fundamentally
haunted. Stirner's response lies in a reduction of investment to the
"Ego"--that is, to a transcendental egoism which will resist the
constraints of abstract ideas. Unicity combats Generality somewhat
like the drive struggles against the powerful fictions of the Freudian
superego. Accordingly, Stirner refuses to admit that love can be exercised
in the name of an external value:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If I cherish you because I hold you dear, because in you my heart finds
nourishment, my need satisfaction, then it is not done for the sake
of a higher essence whose hallowed body you are, not on account of my
beholding in you a ghost; i.e. an appearing spirit, but from egoistic
pleasure; you yourself with your essence are valuable to me, for your
essence is not a higher one, is not higher and more general than you,
is unique like you yourself, because it is you. [<I>EHO,</I> 54]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This idea is identical to Richard Rowan's view of his love for Bertha in
Joyce's play, <I>Exiles</I>; the refusal to defend a beloved woman as a
"possession" or "in the name" of an abstract and higher principle seems
to have found its way into the philosophy developed in Joyce's notes
for <I>Exiles</I>.

<P>
Stirner would probably have been forgotten as a mere oddity, a
minor left-wing Hegelian, had he not become the butt of Marx and
Engels's ferocious humor in <I>The German Ideology,</I> a work that
curiously monumentalizes him by making him the main "enemy" of Marxian
dialectics. <I>The Ego and His Own</I> is accused of embodying ideology;
the central "ego" as "unique" is reduced to the function of a ghost,
thereby demonstrating the culmination of an ideology that is essentially
ghostly. Stirner becomes the whipping boy and scapegoat of historical
materialism, and like Finnegan in the <I>Wake,</I> he quickly turns
into a "hegoak" (<I>FW,</I> 5.07). In order to debunk him, Marx and
Engels feign a tactical incomprehension of the parodic tone so crucial
in <I>The Ego and his Own,</I> deliberately deaf to the ironies that
are rife in Stirner's evocation of a "phantasmagoria." 
<b></b>


<P>

Without realizing it, Saint Max has so far done no more than give
instruction in the art of spirit-seeing, by regarding the ancient

he consciously and <I>ex professo</I> gives instruction in the art of
ghost-seeing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
To be sure, Stirner does not explain the history of Christianity through
the "empirical conditions" and "industrial relations and relations of
exchange" connected to a given form of society. For Marx and Engels,
Stirner remains a prisoner of the spirit that he denounces: by dint of
crying "ghost," he has effectively transformed himself and his entire
conceptual world into a spectral phantasmagoria.

<P>
Certainly, there is little need to reenact the Marxist trial of idealism
and ideology (who would escape whipping?). Yet it is pertinent to note
that the philosophical debunking performed by Marx and Engels hinges on
purely literary strategies; it is as if Stirner's book was referred back
to a fictional world of shadows from which it should never have detached
itself. There also remains the enigma of the curious relentlessness of
Marx and Engels, whose 350 pages of mocking remarks devoted to Stirner
surpass by close to twenty pages the entire volume of <I>The Ego and
His Own</I>--a rare feat of polemical overkill. Like some Bouvards or
P&eacute;cuchets wishing to reach the root of philosophical "idealism,"
Marx and Engels manage to quote almost all of Stirner's essay! As Derrida
suggests in his <I>Specters of Marx,</I> at times they seem miffed by the
mere fact of Stirner's having spoken better and before them of ghosts
and spectrality!
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Yet there is a more serious question at
stake in this struggle for the reduction of ghosts: the staunch Marxist
refusal to conceive of a-relational relation, an "I" that positions
itself as "Ego" or the "Unique" only in order to refute any positioning
and hence disappear.

<P>
Marx and Engels reduce to a "magical incantation" the rhapsody on the
term of "the Unique" which concludes Stirner's treatise. They remark on
the term's unstable status, a non-conceptual concept, when they write
that the "Unique" becomes a word that is "simultaneously more and less
than a word," and they conclude by indicting the surreptitious return
of a Christian repressed: "Sancho-Stirner has found as the object of
his Quixotic quest a pure and empty word which plays the role of Christ
the Redeemer--and redeems itself from any link with reality" (<I>GI,</I>
449-50). Yet the "anti-dialectics" of enunciation invented by Stirner
may be shrewder than Marx and Engles allow: it can be seen as heralding
later insights such as the main intuition of Nietzsche's critique of the
self (there is at least one unmistakable allusion to Stirner's "Unique"
in <I>Thus Spake Zarathustra</I>), Adorno's "negative dialectics," or,
more relevantly perhaps, Blanchot's Neutre, a neutrality more passive
than passivity. For Stirner, the "I" calls itself "Ego" only in order
to transcend itself, to vanish again in its own enunciative process.

<P>
The result is a paradoxical foundation, the enunciation of an "Ego"
that is alternately all and nothing, as evidenced in the famous final
paragraph of <I>The Ego and His Own</I>:
<b></b>


<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

I am owner of my might, and I am so when I know myself as unique. In
the Unique one, the owner himself returns into his creative nothing, of
which he is born. Every higher essence above me, be it God, be it man,
weakens the feeling of my uniqueness, and pales only before the sun of
this consciousness. If I found my cause on myself (Stell' Ich auf Mich
meine Sache), the unique one, then my concern rests on its transitory,
mortalcreator, who consumes himself, and I may say: I have founded my
cause on nothing. [Ich hab' Mein' Sach' auf Nichts gestellt].

<P>
Is this merely, as <I>The German Ideology</I> maintains, a play on
words, the absurd exploitation of a tautology that detaches itself from
language in mysterious and transcendent fashion? One may understand,
however, how the derisive epithets of "Saint Max" and "Sancho" need an
enunciative montage without which the philosophical critique could not
work. Stirner is slowly cornered at the intersection of two texts, the
Bible and <I>Don Quixote,</I> which play a driving polemical role in
the Marxist critique of ideology, allegedly presented in the name of
historical materialism. Indeed, the last word of the caustic review of
"Sancho's" thought is left to Cervantes. Marx saw in Stirner proof,
by incompetence and self-parody, of the bankruptcy of the speculative
system of German idealism.

<P>
Stirner not only "invents" modern anarchism, but also radicalizes the
paradox (that will be taken up by Lacan) of subjective self-positioning
through linguistic enunciation when he writes in his conclusion: "The
conceptual question, 'What is man?' has then changed into the personal
question, 'Who is man?' With 'what' the concept was sought for, in order
to realize it; with 'who' it is no longer any question at all, but the
answer is personally there present at once in the asker: the question
answers itself" (<I>EHO,</I> 366, modified). Stirner, as a writer,
produces a "work" in order to extol the pleasure of life perceived as
the ego's auto-delectation and self-erasure: everything becomes a ghost
for the unique mill of the ego. Being all and nothing at once, the Ego
becomes the non-totalizable source of all the negativity that can be
introduced into the world. It is a view that recalls Fichte rather than
Hegel; here, the combination of their theses provides an unassailable
position--unless you manage to convince the ego that he is just another
ghost. Which is what Marx and Engels attempt with partial success, but
without being able to lay that old and too familiar ghost to rest. It is
here, at the point where the status of the ego is already a contested
and uncertain identity, that Joyce decides to invest it with something
that is more than matter, as opposed to spirit (or the reverse). He must
translate the ghost into his own idiom derived from ethics and politics
formed in the wake of Nietzsche.

That Joyce's work should have found its way into the pages of Mardsen's
journal was more than mere coincidence. If we pay attention to what
Stanislaus Joyce witnessed, his elder brother distinguished himself
early by a Stirnerian attitude. At the beginning of his diary, written
in 1903 when Joyce is assembling material for a tentative autobiography,
Stanislaus notes:

When Stanislaus confesses that he has modeled his life on that of Jim, he
hastens to express fears that he also has adopted his brother's egoism
and is relieved to learn from his aunt that this is not the case. He
is relieved to think that Poppie, his older sister, has none of the
detested selfishness:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Poppie is the most unselfish person I know. . . . She seems to wish, if
anyone is to suffer, that she should be the victim. What an extraordinary
sense of duty women have! . . . Aunt Josephine tells me I underrate
myself and that I am not an egoist. The fact that I think constantly
about myself should prove her that I am. Yet I take myself at Jim's
valuation of me, because it is my own, perhaps. [<I>CDD,</I> 58-59]

As for his elder brother, Stanislaus can spot inconsistencies in his
system:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
His (James's) nature is naturally antagonistic to morality. Morality
bores and irritates him. He tries to live on a principle of impulse. The
justification of his conduct is the genuineness of impulse. The principle
is itself an impulse, not a conviction. He is a polytheist. What pleases
him for the moment is his god for the moment. He demands an absolute
freedom to do as he pleases. . . . This kind of life is naturally highly
unsatisfactory and his conduct bristles with contradictions. [<I>CDD,</I>

<P>
What Stanislaus exposes here is the combination of lax socialism and easy
Nietzscheism that was so dominant a pose among young aesthetes at the turn
of the century. This element is nevertheless a major component of "early
modernism"--as James himself seemed to be aware. Here is the diary again:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Jim boasts--for he often boasts now--of being modern. He calls himself
a socialist but attaches to no school of socialism. He marks the
uprooting of feudal principles. Beside this, and that subtle egoism
which he calls the modern mind, he proclaims all kinds of anti-Christian
ideals--selfishness, licentiousness, pitilessness. What he calls the
domestic virtues are words of contempt in his mouth. He does not recognize
such a thing as gratitude. He says it reminds him of a fellow lending
you an overcoat on a wet night and asking for a receipt. (Gratitude is,
after all, such an uncomfortable sentiment--thanks with a grudge at the
back of it.) As he lives on borrowing and favours, and as people never
fail to treat him in their manners as a genius while he treats them
as fools, he has availed himself of plenty of opportunity of showing
ingratitude. [<I>CDD,</I> 54-55]

<P>
One should not blame Stanislaus for what might appear a jaundiced
assessment. His brother's earlier works, what remains of <I>Stephen
Hero</I> and the 1904 "Portrait of the Artist," all stress the need of
systematic egoism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 At the opening of chapter seventeen of
<I>Stephen Hero,</I> we read that "Maurice" has been "corrupted" by his
brother's idle habits, while "Stephen" resents the family pressure that
is put upon him. He is reluctant to "satisfy the family" by choosing
a remunerative career. "He thanked 
<b></b>
their intention: it had first
fulfilled him with egoism; and he rejoiced that his life had been so
self-centered" (<I>SH,</I> 53). His rejection of Irish society is based
above all upon a loathing for the Irish Catholicism--but he also refuses
the role of a political activist or "demagogue." If his work can change
this society, so much the better! But that goal cannot become a program:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The attitude which was constitutional with him was a silent self-occupied,
contemptuous manner and his intelligence, moreover, persuaded him that the
tomahawk, as an effective instrument of warfare, had become obsolete. He
acknowledged to himself in honest egoism that he could not take to heart
the distress of a nation, the soul of which was antipathetic to his own,
so bitterly as the indignity of a bad line of verse . . ." [<I>SH,</I>
151]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In Joyce's autobiography, the denunciation of egoism is left to others;
thus at one point we see Lynch clearly upset by "Stephen's unapologetic
egoism, his remorseless lack of sentiment for himself no less than for
others" (<I>SH,</I> 156). This is the same picture that we find in the
early "Portrait": its third page describes the "enigma of a manner" that
is supposed to protect Stephen: "It was part of that ineradicable egoism
which he was afterwards to call redeemer that he imagined converging
to him all the deeds and thoughts of the microcosm" ("APA," 259). The
thought cannot simply be ascribed to youthful enthusiasm, since we also
find it in Stephen's mouth at the close of <I>Ulysses,</I> in "Eumaeus,"
when Stephen declares to a baffled Bloom "that Ireland must be important
because it belongs to (him)" (<I>U,</I> 16.1164-65).

<P>
By a typically Fichtean reversal, the early "Portrait of the Artist"
transforms Egoism into Negoism: "His Nego, therefore, written amid a
chorus of peddling Jews' gibberish and Gentile clamour, was drawn up
valiantly while true believers prophesied fried atheism and was hurled
against the obscene hells of our Holy Mother" ("APA," 265). The position
of what the <I>Wake</I> calls a "Negoist Cabler" (<I>FW,</I> 488.21) is
described here as a mere "outburst," for now the artist seems ready to
join a communal movement.

<P>
As Manganiello has shown in his excellent study of <I>Joyce's
Politics,</I> the younger Joyce was deeply drawn to Italian
anarcho-syndicalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 The reference to a new thirty years' war
alludes to German socialism after 1875, that is after the Gotha Congress
that tried to bridge the gap between anarchists and communists. The shift
advocated (from Germany to Italy) shows that Joyce clearly inclines
towards anarchism as an 
<b></b>
ideology that can accept and even foster
egoism. Can one therefore conclude that anarchist egoism is closer to a
nationalist position, while communism stresses an internationalism that
ts against any backsliding into regressive provincialism? That has
been the orthodox Marxist thesis when faced by the dangers of anarchism,
but it may obscure a more complex picture.

<P>
Two couples of concepts need to be linked here: egoism and heroism, on
the one hand; and socialist internationalism and Irish nationalism, on
the other. Consider one example. When Griffith decided in 1906 to rename
his <I>United Irishman</I> and call it <I>Sinn Fein,</I> he knew what
he was doing: his choice of the Irish phrase corresponding to "Ourselves
alone" was a decisive move towards practical and economic solutions for
Ireland rather than an hitherto sterile parliamentary agitation. Ireland,
in Stirner's vocabulary, would start being its "Own" and stop following
other "Causes": it would boycott British products and develop its own
industries and banking system. The letters that Joyce wrote from 1906
to 1908 show him endorsing Griffith's program, though with important
reservations about language and race.

<P>
Yet contrary to our expectations, egoist nationalism, to call it that,
was not necessarily opposed to a revolutionary or internationalist
politics. Marx and Engels themselves, it is worth recalling, had
advocated nationalism as a solution for Ireland in spite of their
noted internationalist leanings. To one correspondent in 1868, after
remarking that, "The Irish question predominates here just now," Marx
urges the overthrow of the Church of England in Ireland, where it is
merely a bulwark for landlordism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 In December 1869, writing
to Engels who was then preparing a monumental history of Ireland that
he never completed, Marx adds that it is vital for the International
Council of Workers to discuss the Irish question: "For a long time I
believed that it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by
English working-class ascendancy. . . . Deeper study has now convinced
me of the opposite. The English working class <I>will never accomplish
anything</I> before it has got rid of Ireland. The lever must be applied
in Ireland. That is why the Irish question is so important for the social
movement in general" (<I>IIQ,</I> 382). One year before his death in
1883 (and scarcely a week after James Joyce's birth), Engels writes to
Kautsky (February 7, 1882): "I hold the view that two nations in Europe
have not only the right but even the duty to be nationalistic before
they become internationalistic: the Irish and the Poles. They are most
internationalistic when they are genuinely nationalistic" (<I>IIQ,</I>
432). Joyce would apply this precept with a vengeance.

<P>
Though Engels advocated Irish nationalism, he had no patience with what
he considered an anarchist deviation of armed nationalism--namely direct
action as advocated by the Fenians. He strongly condemned terrorist coups
such as the Phoenix Park assassination of 1882: "Thus the 'heroic deed'
in Phoenix Park appears if not as pure stupidity, then at least as pure
Bakuninist, bragging, purposeless 'propagande par le fait'" (<I>IIQ,</I>
436). The same letter urges Eduard Bernstein "never [to] praise a single
Irishman--a politician--unreservedly, and never identify yourself with him
before he is dead," since "Celtic blood and the customary exploitation of
the peasant 
<b></b>
make Irish politicians very responsible to corruption"
(<I>IIQ,</I> 436). He then cites O'Connell's notorious bribes and the
famous rejoinder of one of the Land League leaders who was responding
to the reproach that he had sold his country: "Yes, and I was damned
glad to have a country to sell."

<P>
Thus, when Joyce was offered the possibility of serializing his novel
describing how a young Irish man refuses the traps that are his family's
values, the dominant Catholicism that had triumphed over Parnell, and
even a well-meaning but stumbling Irish nationalism, he could recognize
not only that he had found a kindred spirit in Dora Marsden, but also that
his struggle against several varieties of imperialism (British and Roman,
at least) could be promoted by her reasonably militant journal. Joyce
had read Marsden's editorial notes carefully, as his allusion to the
"egomen" shows, and it might even be argued that the linguistic theory
that is acted out in <I>Finnegans Wake</I> is fundamentally Marsden's. But
to appreciate that requires a broader consideration of the relationship
between egoism, modernism, and Joyce's general literary politics.

4. Egoism and Individualism as Philosophical Modernism: A Debate
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Joyce's version of an early and heroic egoism took Parnell as a key
re, the true "leader" who had been sold and betrayed to the British
by Irish politicians who, thereby, had sacrificed the only hope of
achieving a peaceful transition to postcolonial independence. His
conclusion was that some type of Egoism--Sinn Feinn can be translated
as "I am my own"--was a safer course. This view, however, was not
only a result of Joyce's private identifications, but essentially a
major component of modernism, as Michael Levenson has shown in his
<I>Genealogy of Modernism,</I> which describes the process whereby,
among the turn-of-the-century intellectuals, "liberalism decomposed
into egoism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 More recently, Weldon Thornton has tried to
qualify Levenson's views by attempting to demonstrate that Joyce may
have been niether an egoist nor a modernist, but that Stephen Dedalus was
both. In his provocative <I>The Antimodernism of Joyce's Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man</I>, he mounts a systematic attack on modernism
in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Modernism becomes a kind of "bad egoism" that
determines the failure of Joyce's first literary creation, Stephen
Dedalus. For Thornton, modernism cannot be restricted to the meaning
the term has in literary history--which is the meaning I have given it
so far. It must be seen as complicit with a vast philosophical program,
perhaps as old as philosophy, more recently dating from Galileo's and
Locke's pioneering distinction between primary and secondary qualities,
a distinction that was to generate the broad movement of skepticism
in regard to the power of human consciousness. What he subsequently
brands as "the Modernist Syndrome" is the separation between subject and
object achieved in Cartesian philosophy, one that would indeed culminate
in egoism.

<P>
In this reconstruction, modernism in general would be defined by the
conjunction of individual skepticism in the realm of society and culture,
and, in epistemology, of all the splits between subject and object,
mind and matter, that have allowed 
<b></b>
for the progress of Western
sciences. When this ideology identifies itself with modernity, especially
after the French Revolution, it leads to the dissolution of a unified
social psyche. Wilde's paradoxes, his witty inversions of commonsensical
beliefs, are the sign of a strict hiatus between the world of empirical
objects and the mind that is now free to reconstruct a world out of
nothing (<I>TAJ,</I> 29-31). Egoism would thus appear as the outcome
and the symptom of early and high modernism, and the main "symptom-bearer"
is Joyce's fictional projection of himself into Stephen Dedalus.

<P>
Thornton is among those who dislike Stephen Dedalus. For him, Stephen
is a failure, an Irish would-be "artist," and never a spokesman of the
author. Such a de-authorization of the central character allows Joyce to
combine techniques derived from two antagonistic traditions, symbolism
and naturalism, and their combined energies help create an original type
of Bildungsroman whose aim is to "expose the paltriness of the modernist
view of the self" (<I>TAJ,</I> 57). Since Modernism has been identified
with atomic individualism, Joyce's plan, according to Thornton, is to
reconstruct the self as a full, social, and organic entity in order
to combat egoism under all its shapes. <I>A Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man</I> has often been commended for its insistence on the
creative value of language in the development of an adolescent. Thornton
strongly denies that Joyce reduces thought to language--an idea that
is nevertheless crucial in Marsden's egoist semantics. Yet in his
discussion of the final chapter in <I>Portrait,</I> Thornton faces
mounting difficulties when he deals with the entries of Stephen's diary
(which end the novel with major claims about his artistic autonomy and
spirtitual self-liberation), entries that betray inadequacies as much as
they convey his hopes and plans. Can this be treated as a sign of Joyce's
refusal to identify his character with his language, as proof that he
is attacking a superficial version of modernism, or that modernism is
being debunked through the parodic exposition of Stephen's immaturity?

<P>
No doubt there is a parodic element in Joyce's presentation of the
progressive liberation of a "young man" who chooses the arduous
path of artistic rebellion against the traps and trappings of family
values, religious models, and national politics. As Thornton's writes,
"while Stephen aspires to the Enlightenment program of complete
self-knowledge, Joyce wishes us to realize how specious that aim
is, and how simple and superficial a view of the psyche it involves"
(<I>TAJ,</I> 152). For instance, Stephen remains very Irish in spite of
himself, which proves that Joyce often works against his hero's declared
values. That, however, does not mean that the main goal of the novel is
to bridge the gap between self and world that Galileo and Descartes had
opened. Critics who belong to Thornton's "reconstructive" camp would
probably follow Stephen through <I>Ulysses</I> and note how badly he
needs Bloom's full humanity and <I>caritas</I> to compensate for his
failings and shallowness. But what of Molly's monologue? And what to
do with <I>Finnegans Wake</I>? Thornton notes correctly that it is
"a book devoted to radically a-personal elements, generic elements,
perhaps even pre-human elements, in human experience" (<I>TAJ,</I> 61)
Since he refuses to believe that the novel evades traditional models
of meaning, Thornton has to confess to a certain bafflement: "In light
of Joyce's concern in his earlier works with 'individualism,' 
<b></b>
one
of the most striking things about <I>Finnegans Wake</I> is the absence
in it of anything like individual characters." (<I>TAJ,</I> 61) His
critical honesty forces Thornton to acknowledge that the <I>Wake</I>
cannot be brought aligned with the alleged "message" of <I>Ulysses</I>:
"<I>Ulysses</I> is in some degree paradigmatic of how Joyce feels we
should respond to our own life-crises--namely, by tempering our sense
of ego and of our separateness from one another, but not by abandoning
the conscious self and the values that it brings into being. Not so in
<I>Finnegans Wake</I> . . ." (<I>TAJ,</I> 62). One can therefore conclude
that Joyce's utter intractability justifies the whole "experiment" of his
later work: with the <I>Wake,</I> he has managed to write a text that
can be seen to resist all humanistic recuperations--and that achieves
this aim by expanding his earlier egoism. Or perhaps by preferring a
novelistic model of egoism to a philosophical concept.

<P>
In the fiction that escapes from the autobiographical sphere, Joyce
often provides interesting critiques of egoism, especially when it
appears not as the expression of the self's liberation but as nihilistic
impotence. The "case" of Mr. Duffy would provide a good example of
this critique. "A Painful Case" shows how a man can condemn a woman to
degradation and finally to an ignominious death through his rejection
of love: "He thought that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical
stature; and as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more
and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he
recognised as his own, insisting on the soul's incurable loneliness. We
cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Is Mr. Duffy
the negative version of the egoist? Perhaps, especially when we remember
that this story is based upon an incident that happened to Stanislaus
Joyce. Let us take this as an opportunity to return to his diary and
its comments about literary egoism, or, more precisely about Meredith's
famous novel, <I>The Egoist.</I>

5. The Book of Egoism: "Cribbed out of Meredith" (<I>U</I> 14.1486)
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
A long and self-conscious passage in the Dublin Diary is devoted to a
systematic comparison between Henry James and George Meredith. Stanislaus
values James over Meredith and finds many faults with two main novels,
<I>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</I> and <I>The Egoist</I>. "<I>The</I>
<I>Egoist</I> is later and more mature work, but its construction is
far worse. It drags intolerably until within about 100 pages of the
end, and then ends like a farce by Pinero" (<I>CDD,</I> 120). Stanislaus
summarizes the plot, stressing its artificiality and obscurity ("Vernon
Whitford and Colonel de Craye evidently know as much about the affair as
Meredith himself"), and he concludes, "Perhaps what is called a 'plot'
has little attraction for me, but it seems to me that <I>The Egoist</I>
has to be written again and that the man who will write it must be able
to write without a 'plot,' directly from his characters" (<I>CDD,</I>
121). It is precisely the kind of advice that Joyce paid attention to
when he rewrote <I>Stephen Hero</I> as <I>A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man.</I> One might suggest not only that Joyce's first novel is a
variation on the theme of <I>The Egoist,</I> but also that <I>Ulysses</I>
attempts to overcome aporias of anarchist 
<b></b>
egoism by fusing the main
themes of two novels: <I>Richard Feverel</I> serves for the "father and
son" intrigue that links Bloom and Stephen, as some explicit allusions
make clear, while <I>The Egoist</I> serves for another motif of equal
importance--as we shall see.

<P>
The hero of <I>The Egoist</I> is Sir Willoughby Patterne, a rich and
handsome country squire who has reached the age of marrying. Initially
he hesitates between the "dashing" and wealthy Constantia Durham and
a shy, romantic neighbor, Laetitia Dale, who is also a poet. After
he has chosen Constantia as a match appropriate to his standing, she
suddenly marries someone else. Wounded personally and socially, Sir
Willoughby turns back to Laetitia, to whom he suggests that they will
eventually marry. Meanwhile, to escape the social embarrassment caused
by Constantia, he spends three years travelling in America with his
cousin. When he returns, his mother frowns upon Laetitia, and he meets
his ideal partner, Clara Middleton. She unites all the qualities of the
others: she is well-off, independent, the daughter of a renowned scholar,
and, though only eighteen, assuredly beautiful and clever. She allows
him to pay court, but after she has grudgingly accepted his marriage
proposal and been presented as the official "betrothed," she slowly
realizes that he is an intolerable egoist who wants to keep her in his
world and will deny the autonomy she requires. He behaves like a feudal
lord who expects absolute devotion from his subjects:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I confess to exacting that kind of dependency. Feudalism is not an
objectionable thing if you can be sure of the lord. You know, Clara
. . . I do not claim servitude, I stipulate for affection. I claim to be
surrounded by persons loving me. And with one? . . .dearest! So that the
two can shut out the world: we live what is the dream of others. Nothing
imaginable can be sweeter. It is a veritable heaven on earth. To be the
possessor of the whole of you! Your thoughts,hopes, all.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The slowness denounced by Stanislaus Joyce corresponds to the long
internal struggle within Clara, who is at first in love with Willoughby,
or at least flattered by his "devotion," then comes slowly to the
conclusion that she must reject him if she is to remain "her own." At
one point she thinks: "My mind is my own, married or not," and the
narrator adds: "It was the point in dispute" (<I>E,</I> 64). Love implies
possessiveness and she cannot accept the limitation of her freedom that
it entails. She tries to pretend to be jealous of Laetitia (still in love
with Willoughby, despite his two rejections), a ploy that works only
until the two young women become friends. In their rather cordial and
intense discussion, Clara admits to having become an "egoist" herself
("I have latterly become an Egoist thinking of no one but myself,
scheming to make use of every soul I meet"), adding in self-defense
that women need different weapons: "But then women are in the position
of inferiors. They are hardly out of the nursery when a lasso is round
their necks . . ." (<I>E,</I> 132). Finally, she systematizes the main
opposition between male and female egoism: "Here is the difference I see;
I see it; I am certain of it: women who are called coquettes make their
conquests not 
<b></b>
of the best of men; but men who are Egoists have good
women for their victims; women on whose devoted constancy they feed;
they drink it like blood" (<I>E,</I> 133). Laetitia who first thinks
that she is hearing "discursive observations upon the inequality in the
relations of the sexes" then understands that this discourse concerns
Clara and her--her role has been outlined by her new "friend."

<P>
Clara finds help and support when a friend comes on the scene,
Colonel de Craye, who is half-Irish, a born seducer, and a rival of
Willoughby. Clara more or less openly allows him to flirt with her, and
almost runs away, followed nevertheless by Vernon, Willoughby's cousin
who is secretly in love with her. Eventually she will leave with Vernon
(at Willoughby's request; he prefers to see her go with his cousin than
with his rival). She loses her social respectability by doing so, but
seems in the end to have found her freedom. Willoughby marries Laetitia,
who by now has lost all her illusions, and just accepts the arrangement
because she needs the money and power. She too has become an egoist, as
she explains in the penultimate chapter.

<P>
Meredith bases his system on what was for him "science," the theory of
evolution. Why has Clara yielded to Willoughby's entreaties? "He looked
the fittest; he justified the dictum of science. The survival of the
Patternes was assured" (<I>E,</I> 35). Egoism is merely a vestige
of an archaic past that sends us back directly to primitive man:
"The Egoist, who is our original male in giant form . . ." (<I>E,</I>
191). The splendid mansion of the Patternes has been built out of such
a primitive accumulation of wealth and egoism: "Aforetime a grand old
egoism built the House. It would appear that ever finer essences of it
are demanded to sustain the structure: but especially would it appear
that a reversion to the gross original, beneath a mask and in a vein of
fineness, is an earthquake at the foundations of the House" (<I>E,</I>
6-7). Willoughby's naive egoism appears thus as an "anachronic
spectre" coming from the past of his family and mankind. He is therefore
ridiculous--comedy is the only medicine one can apply to his case. The
novel opens with the parallel presentation of the "Book of the earth,"
which might also be called "the book of egoism" (<I>E,</I> 3), and of
the imps of the comic spirit who can try to correct egoism. However, the
egoist should also inspire pity (and we know that Meredith admitted to
having introduced a lot of himself under the disguise of Sir Willoughby
Patterne--but can we pity the hero for that matter?). "The Egoist surely
inspires pity. He who would desire to clothe himself at everybody's
expense, and is of that desire condemned to strip himself stark naked,
he, if pathos ever had a form, might be taken for the actual person"
(<I>E,</I> 6) The uneasy mixture of comedy and pathos makes for narrative
slowness, while dramatic ironies abound. It is Willoughby, for instance,
who warns Clara never to marry an Egoist! "Beware of marrying an Egoist,
my dear!" he blurts out, never thinking that Clara can apply the term to
him. She grasps it avidly. "None of them saw the man in the word, none
noticed the word; yet this word was her medical herb, her illuminating
lamp, the key of him (and, alas, but she thought it by feeling her
need of one), the advocate pleading in apology for her. Egoist! She
beheld him--unfortunate, self-designed man that he was!" (<I>E,</I>
82). Meredith, it seems, has come by a different route to discern the

<b></b>
same circularity linking concept and active realization in an
utterance. The simple mental enunciation of "Egoist" propels action,
leads to a series of imitative tactics.

<P>
This generalized performativity is philosophically very impressive, while
it brings added problems to the novel's economy: it fails to bring out
the "comedy" that would work as the main antidote to egoism. Despite
its links with the famous lecture delivered in 1877 on "Comedy and the
Uses of the Comic spirit" (<I>E,</I> 431-450), <I>The Egoist</I>
never becomes funny enough to propel itself beyond mere psychological
delineation, despite its advertised ambition. The satire never really
takes off (perhaps because the theme was too painfully close to Meredith's
own life). <I>Ulysses,</I> instead manages to be consistently comic, in
the very spirit advocated by Meredith, without ever flaunting comedy
as a key to, or a consequence of, the idea of the book. This is where
Joyce has clearly gone beyond Meredith--but he may have been helped by
Stanislaus's scathing remarks.

<P>
Thus, the central issue in the interpretation of Meredith's novel is
to decide whether Clara becomes an egoist, and if she does, what that
means. Laetitia becomes one at the novel's end, cynically admitting
her disillusionment with Willoughby and romantic feelings. Clara has
learned from Willoughby the uses of egoism, which forces her to think
of herself and to refuse the lure of self-sacrifice that is expected of
women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 One finds a few passages in which Meredith clearly
approves of feminine retaliation facing male egoism: "Let women tell
us of their side of the battle. We are not so much the test of the
Egoist in them as they to us. Moments of similarity shown in crowned
and undiademed ladies of intrepid independence suggest their occasional
capacity to be like men when it is given to them to hunt" (<I>E,</I>
191). Clara is also betrayed by her own father in her struggle, since
he cannot understand her desire to be "her own," and would prefer her
to make a socially rewarding marriage. Like Richard Feverel, Clara will
have to discover herself as unique and her own through an "ordeal." It
is likely that Meredith had heard of Stirner's book, although it was not
available in English at the time. Egoism smacks also of capitalism as the
next stage after feudal society: the egoist wishes to buy a wife who will
be treated as a beautiful ornament, and merely add to his riches. And
what is fundamentally condemned by Meredith is the lack of reciprocity
that egoism entails: "In the hundred and fourth chapter of the thirteenth
volume of the BOOK of EGOISM, it is written: Possession without obligation
to the object possessed approaches felicity. It is the rarest condition
of ownership" (<I>E,</I> 110). Possession, Meredith explains, generally
entails some vestigial obligation to the object owned. Not in one case
only: "Our possession of an adoring female's worship is this instance"
(<I>E,</I> 111).

<P>
This analysis is very close to what Meredith denounces as sentimentalism
in <I>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</I>--a sentence that is quoted, as
we remember, by Stephen Dedalus when he sends his famous telegram to
Buck Mulligan: "'Sentimentalists,' says The Pilgrim's Scrip, 'are they
who seek to enjoy without incurring the Immense Debtorship for a thing
done.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Sentimentalism, as an attempt to negate a sense
of debt, is a weaker form of egoism: at least an egoist behaves more or
less consciously 
<b></b>
like a despot. That is why avid readers of Meredith
such as Harriet Weaver and Dora Marsden could embrace egoism, but never
accept sentimentalism. When Harriet Weaver congratulated Marsden on the
change of name from the <I>New Freewoman</I> to the <I>Egoist,</I> she
urged that it would be a "good challenge to sentimentalism"; in a similar
way, when Marsden expresses doubts about Allen Upward as an editor, she
writes: "I am terrified he will turn out a sentimentalist" (both quoted
in <I>DM,</I> 123). Bruce Clarke explains how the spirit of anarchism
penetrated the stronghold of suffragism through a reference to <I>The
Egoist</I>--as early as December 1911!--in a leading article by Selwyn
Weston, who explained that the seemingly self-effacing protagonist,
Vernon Whitford, was "no less an egoist than Willoughby" (<I>DM,</I>
66). The logical development for the two female editors was to replace
Meredith with Stirner--a development that, as I have suggested, was the
exact inverse of Joyce's own progression through various modes of egoism.

<P>
One passage in Meredith's <I>Egoist</I> may be even more relevant to
the situation of Stephen than the famous subtitle of <I>The Ordeal of
Richard Feverel: A History of Father and Son</I>; it is the analysis
of dissociation brought about by the pain of jealousy to the egoist who
realizes that he is about to lose his prize. When Willoughby manages to
control himself, above all by thinking that Clara has been touched by
scandal, his psychic disaggregation is arrested; but in what alarmingly
looks like a parody of Christian theology, Meredith explains how he
becomes his own Father and Son:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Consider him indulgently: the Egoist is the Son of Himself. He is likewise
the Father. And the son loves the father, the father the son; they
reciprocate affection through the closest ties . . . The two rub together
in sympathy besides relationship to an intenser one. Are you, without
much offending, sacrificed by them, it is on the altar of their mutual
love, to filial piety or paternal tenderness: the younger has offered
a dainty morsel to the elder, or the elder to the younger. Absorbed in
their great example of devotion, they do not think of you. They are
beautiful. . . . The Egoist is our fountain-head, primeval man: the
primitive is born again, the elemental reconstituted. Born again, into
new conditions, the primitive may be highly polished of men, and forfeit
nothing save the roughness of his original nature. He is not only his
own father, he is ours; and he is also our son. We have produced him,
he us. [<I>E,</I> 324-25]
<!--_/extract-->

<P>
Meredith enables us to understand not only the overcoming of
Stephen's juvenile egoism, the illusion he entertains of a "mystical"
self-begetting, but also the way a female self can both go beyond egoism
and signify its culmination. In this sense, Molly Bloom is a direct
heir of Clara Middleton, for she radicalizes egoism in her "pre-human"
and "post-human" function when she becomes one with Gea-Tellus. The
"father-and-son" intrigue vanishes from the "plot" in order to allow
for the apotheosis of a female being who can assert independence that
is beyond immanence or transcendence. "Penelope" and Clara Middleton
gain their freedom by contradicting themselves a lot and by losing a
little of their reputation. Thus can they be free and also accept life
in all its manifestations. And when Gea-Tellus becomes 
<b></b>
one with a
principle of paradoxical narratology, based upon orality, so as to never
really tell us the tale we expect, but let language deploy itself in all
its masks and obfuscations, we have reached the <I>terra non firma</I>
of <I>Finnegans Wake.</I>

<P>
In a typically modernist fashion, the only way for Joycean egoism to
triumph is to blend with language. Joyce's strong ego has often been
contrasted with Pound's more volatile and esemplastic personality,
but they share a fundamental attitude that was well captured by Olson,
writing about Pound: "Ez's epic solves problem by his ego . . . thus
creates the methodology of the <I>Cantos,</I> viz, a space-field where,
by inversion, though the material is all time material, he has driven
through it so sharply by the beak of his ego that he has turned time
into what we must now have, space &amp; its live air."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

Joyce's epic also solves all problems by his ego, but an ego that is
opposed from the start to different obstacles. We can recognize the
"egoes" in the famous "eagles" that will come to "pull out the eyes"
of the frightened baby tuckoo at the beginning of <I>A Portrait of the
Artist,</I> threatening super-egos who are messengers of a law that is
administered by women first, and only later by men.

<P>
Throughout his career, the strategy adopted by Joyce was much the
same. Hiding under the tables of the law, he multiplied his "I's" in order
to avoid the frightening beaks. For him, paradoxically, moral courage
was founded on the lability of the I, a view that owes much to the chief
charactersitic of the Stirnerian unique one, who is also <I>causa sui.</I>
Egoism can never be equated with an essentialism of the self. Thus the
double motto (shared with Pound) of "Never explain, never apologize." To
apologize (we are never told whether young Stephen did apologize in front
of Dante, but we know that he suffered from his eyes all his life) implies
a moral law; that has to be subverted, for an apology is synonymous with
excuse, and an "ex-cuse" is a way of ex-causing oneself, of refusing the
single "cause" one has to become, namely oneself. Like Stirner, Joyce
chose to become his own cause and consistently refused to apologize.

<P>
Yet egoism must be distinguished from egotism. Joyce would not have
written memoirs as did Stendhal in his <I>Souvenirs d'Egotisme,</I> a
diary he kept between 1821 and 1830.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Egotism implies the
heroic cultivation of the self, as we find in romantic and postromantic
literature, from Goethe to Barr&eacute;s, via Stendhal, Baudelaire,
and Gide, while egoism implies a radical anarchism that refuses any
authority. Egotism is mainly a literary movement. (It has been highly
developed in French literature, perhaps because of the centrality of
Montaigne and the important debate between him and Pascal that dominated
most discussions about moralism and anti-moralism in France during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.) Whereas egoism is a political
movement, much closer to German or English trends. Joyce always appeared
impatient of literary egotism, and in a conversation with Arthur Power he
insisted that <I>Ulysses</I> offered a critique of "egotism." "Nature is
quite unromantic. It is we who put romance into here, which is a false
attitude, an egotism, absurd like all egotisms. In <I>Ulysses</I> I
have tried to keep close to fact."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Just a few years later,
<I>Finnegans Wake</I> also stressed the limitation of "egotism," using
metanarrative logics based on a-personal 
<b></b>
sigla and statements
(e.g., "--Cockran, eggotisters, limitated" [<I>FW,</I> 137.8]). But
Joyce's initial Stirnerian position forced him to see the ghosts
surrounding the antiromantic "facts" he claimed he had never left aside.

<P>
The egoist, like the ego, owns himself only after he has been reconciled
with various ghosts, a journey that might take us, in Joyce's case, from
Ibsen, the main "egoarch", to such Wakean idioms such as "me altar's ego
in miniature" (<I>FW,</I> 463.7), an endless recirculation of a-personal
subjects that can "guide them through the labyrinth of their samilikes and
the alteregoases of their pseudoselves" (<I>FW,</I> 576.32-33). The
task that devolves on feminine characters is less to eradicate than to
sublimate egoism by creating a new and vital affirmation. This explains
why the feminist "egoism" Joyce found in Dora Marsden, Harriet Weaver,
and later Sylvia Beach, was so instrumental in his career and helped
him throughout his life. The "Egomen" who helped him believe in himself
were above all women who were devoted, dedicated, and loved him not as
a person, but as a cause, a cause he did not so much defend as embody.

<P>
As Lacan has suggested his seminar on Joyce, Joyce can be understood as
the <I>sinthome:</I> a sinner and a saintly man, he was the cultural and
political symptom of modernity, yet also the modern avatar of Aquinas,
writing his <I>Summa</I> in order to expose how all the interlocking
circles of the Real, the Imaginary and the Symbolic are enmeshed and
intertwined in a knot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Joyce's cause is still the cause
of writing, understood here less as literature, more as a psychic
apparatus that keeps together traces impelling the active secret of
sexual division. Joyce's egoism never reclaims the subjective self as
the source of values, but points to an other cause that contains the
keys of the structure of a subjectivity constituted by language. In
that movement, Joyce shows his fundamental alliance with a postfeminist
position such as that of Dora Marden, who remained a feminist in spite
of her repudiation of her former suffragist ideology. In spite of our
likes and dislikes, this brand of egoism does not foster rejection or
hate; it even triggers a paradoxical love. Or, to quote a French magazine
aptly called <I>Ego&iuml;ste</I>: an egoist is just somebody who doesn't
love me.
