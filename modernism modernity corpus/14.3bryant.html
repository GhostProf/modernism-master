<p id="lead">The paradoxical directive both to "make it new" and to retrieve a usable past has become a commonplace in accounts of American literary modernism. For Pound, Eliot, and H. D., the Classical tradition and its literary monuments provided foundations on which to reinvent poetic form. Moreover, such cultural artifacts served the purpose of articulating an American modernity; as Celena Kusch has argued, American modernists felt "considerable pressure to create an ancient well of artistic experience and ability for themselves."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In achieving these goals, making it new and retrieving the past were neither mutually exclusive activities, nor exclusive to creative writers. As H. D.'s generation of modern poets came of age, Egyptology emerged as an American academic discipline—a key intersection that critics have largely overlooked. James Henry Breasted, the father of American Egyptology and founder of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, would formulate a "New Past" that positioned the United States as Egypt's cultural inheritor. Influenced by modernist Egyptology as well as by her travels, H. D. came to share with Breasted a belief in Egypt's cultural primacy. And like Breasted, she would seek a monumental past that did not simply reinshrine the traditional Greco-Roman one. If Europe had a lock on Classical monuments, and the United States lacked monuments in the traditional sense, ancient Egypt offered these Egypto-modernists a new usable past that rerouted Eurocentric cultural transmission. </p>

<p>This essay crosses disciplines both in terms of its central res and its methodology—a collaboration between a literary critic and a Classical archaeologist. For Breasted and 

<b></b>

 H. D., archaeology proved fundamental to understanding Egypt. Indeed, archaeological tropes inflected a wide range of artistic, scholarly, and popular discourses during the modernist period, as the editors reminded us in the  special issue "Archaeologies of the Modern." Jeffrey Schnapp, Michael Shanks, and Matthew Tiews note that archaeology has contributed to "historical, national, and international myths of origin and (dis)continuity: of group identity formation (nationalisms), race (ethnicity), technological progress, the rise and fall of civilizations."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Breasted's excavation projects were important means of acquiring artifacts for the Oriental Institute, furthering his academic career and enhancing his popular appeal as a lecturer and fund raiser. In his writing Breasted would link archaeology to the discourse of evolution in formulating the New Past. H. D. owned copies of his <i>A History of Egypt</i> and five-volume <i>Ancient Records of Egypt,</i> as well as <i>A Concise Dictionary of Egyptian Archaeology. </i>When H. D.'s critics have addressed archaeology, they tend to focus on Freudian psychoanalysis, which, as Julian Thomas states, offers the clearest "metaphorical use" of the discipline in modern thinking.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  And yet as we shall see, her stratigraphy is more materialist than Freud's. H. D. insists, for example, that she had seen Karnak's Amun temple pictured on Freud's wall, while "he had not."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Both H. D. and Breasted were drawn especially to this ancient site, which res prominently in their work. </p>

<p>Each writer in fact shared an archaeological sensibility that "mak[es] material culture the equal of text, " as Gavin Lucas puts it.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Breasted validated his cultural work by emphasizing his proximity to ancient archaeological sites. For example, he stresses that his textbook <i>A History of the Ancient Egyptians</i> is "based directly and immediately upon the monuments" and is thus distinct from the growing number of books produced "at second and third hand."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  H. D.'s story "Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt" contains four scenes in which the protagonist simulates excavation: "she paused, digging with her gloved finger down some inches (it seemed) into the incurve (cut clean in the stone)." In <i>Helen in Egypt</i> the protagonist effects a spiritual epigraphy by decoding hieroglyphic inscriptions in the Amun temple, seeking to "realize the transcendental in material terms."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Epigraphy, a subdiscipline of archaeology and a major component of Breasted's research, involves the transcription and translation of hieroglyphs. He founded the Epigraphic Survey of the Oriental Institute in Luxor in 1924 to record ancient inscriptions and reliefs that were rapidly deteriorating. Although H. D. could not read hieroglyphics, the fact that women were often employed as transcribers in such projects may have furthered her sense of physical connection. Breasted and H. D. valued the inscribed nature of ancient Egyptian monuments, and they drew on these artifacts to ground their alternative depictions of Egypt.  </p>

<p>Comparing the archaeologically-inflected views of Breasted and H. D. with other modernist representations of Egypt complicates our understanding of how Western thinkers positioned its ancient culture. Breasted's numerous excavations helped establish him as the first professor of Egyptology in the United States, and prompted his influential New Past theory. H. D.'s engagement with Egypt's ancient sites was a crucial factor in her move to the long poem and major status. Although Egypt would ultimately prove more heterogeneous for H. D. than for Breasted, both constructed an American 

<b></b>

 Nile through which they asserted cultural authority and national identity. During the chaos and destruction engendered by two global wars, Breasted and H. D. would turn to ancient Egypt as a source of spiritual stability and renewal. Their revaluation and repositioning of Egypt as central to Western civilization's development—which we term <i>Egypto-modernism</i>—provides an alternative to the Hellenistic frameworks that shaped mainstream modernist thought. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Ancient Egypt's Shifting Terrains
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Breasted and H. D. were well aware that their explorations of ancient Egypt circulated within a culture that had become saturated with popular misconceptions. Even before the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, there was a fashion for things Egyptian in Europe, Britain, and America. In the first decade of the twentieth century, exotic renderings of Egypt shaped popular music such as the Oriental foxtrot and the 1905 song "There's Egypt in Your Dreamy Eyes."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Antonia Lant notes that a proliferation of mummy films appeared in the U.S. between 1912 and 1915, "at least four film companies" worked in Egypt before World War I, and five Cleopatra films were produced "between 1908 and 1918 alone."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Indeed, the emphasis on female licentiousness in both Biblical and Classical literary traditions shaped the <i>femmes fatales</i> of early cinema, which included Potiphar's wife (Jacob's would-be seducer), as well as Cleopatra. With the exception of Biblical films about Moses and the book of Exodus, exotic conceptions of Egypt had begun to overshadow the despotic vision of pharaoh present in the Hebrew captivity narrative. Americans' fascination with ancient Egypt preceded the emergence of academic Egyptologists like Breasted, who noted in his journal that the Egyptian <i>Book of the Dead</i> had already "become, in title at least, a household word in the Western world."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  So when Howard Carter began excavating Tut's treasures in 1922, the effect "was a bit like adding gasoline to a fire," as Michael North puts it. Sarah Witte notes that Egyptian influenced fashions were prominent in both <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> throughout the 1920s.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  H .D.'s story "Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt" reflects this oversaturation when protagonist Helen Fairwood perceives that "'everything seems painted . . . cardboard,'" a vocabulary similar to the one H. D. used to deride overdone sets in historical epic films. In the story, Captain Rafton's response to Fairwood points to the popular sources of her perceptual bias: "'You mean you seem to have seen all this before? But it's on everything, cigarette boxes posters in the underground; cigarette boxes [sic], magazine ads'" (<i>P,</i> 188). Because Westerners tended to view Egypt as source of the exotic and mysterious rather than of civilization, tourists' initial impressions could be unsatisfactory—even when viewing ancient monuments. </p>

<p>The Tutankhamun excavations and other archaeological sites proved crucial to H. D.'s and Breasted's revaluation of Egypt's role in cultural transmission. Breasted entered Tutankhamun's tomb several times at Howard Carter's request, deciphering seals on the doorways and providing other historical information. Although he was a seasoned Egyptologist, Breasted was nonetheless jarred by Tutankhamun's treasures: 

<b></b>

 "Here was the magnificence which only the wealth and splendor of the Imperial Age in Egypt in the fourteenth century before Christ could have wrought or conceived." The golden royal chariots<b>—</b>which Breasted saw as "not vulgar and ostentatious magnificence, but the richness of matured and refined art"—made "the splendor of Nineveh and Babylon" appear to be "but a rough foil for setting off the civilization of Egyptian Thebes" (qtd. in <i>PP,</i> 331, 337). H.D. saw one of the chariot wheels brought from the tomb. Filtering her perception through Helen Fairwood in the "Secret Name" story, she describes its startling brightness as being "brought to birth, brought back after four thousand years, to light. The very chariot wheel, gold, too gold, not even with the softness of some Mycenaean or Grecian burial to tone it down, to give it semblance of antiquity" (<i>P, </i>191). Here "too gold" both reinforces Orientalist conceptions of a gaudy East, and troubles temporal boundaries by appearing new. The Tutankhamun discovery, which North has termed "the first truly modern media event,"<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  circulated widely in the press and popular imagination, drawing crowds to Carter's excavation. Although Tut's tomb was a significant site for Breasted and H. D., the monumental expansiveness of Karnak would allow them more room to articulate their Egypto-modernism. </p>

<p>Both were especially influenced by Karnak's vast temple complex dedicated to the sun god Amun, one of the chief gods of the Egyptian pantheon. Before the Tut phenomenon, continuing excavations at Karnak made it one of the most studied Egyptian sites in the early twentieth century. Every ancient Egyptian pharaoh from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000 B.C.E.) until the Ptolemaic period (c. 330 B.C.E.) made additions to Karnak, so that it constituted for Breasted "a great historical volume";<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  most of the columns and walls are covered with hieroglyphs. Spreading across ten acres and including the colossal temple to Amun, the main complex has hundreds of lotus bud columns, statues, and obelisks. An additional eighty-five enclosed acres are filled with smaller temples and storehouses. Breasted's writings emphasize the sheer size and scale of the buildings, noting that in "the greatest colonnaded hall ever erected by man" each column capital "is large enough to contain a group of a hundred men standing crowded upon it at the same time" (<i>CC, </i>99). These particular columns are approximately seventy feet high (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). H. D. is similarly impressed with Karnak's colossal scale. Her surrogate character Helen Fairwood, who has "hard-won" expertise in Classics, notes that "the Parthenon itself" would fit into the "enormous court-yard" of Tuthmoses II's banquet chamber, with sufficient room to include "such tiny exquisite toys as the Erechtheum and the Nike," other major buildings of the Acropolis (<i>P,</i> 176, 214). The Parthenon is widely considered the greatest achievement of ancient Greek sacred architecture. And yet for H. D., Karnak's divine proportions challenge the Classical world's use of humans as the standard of measurement:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In Greece, even in so late a building as the Italian Paestum there was that strange insistence upon human achievement. One measured oneself by the tiny Nike temple, out-jutting on the Acropolis. Even in the more massive Paestum, one measured oneself and one's status by some known and intellectual formula. Here was magnificence of another order."</p>

<p class="continued">

 H. D. would struggle to let go of her Hellenism which, as Eileen Gregory points out, gave her writing an "orientation within historical, aesthetic, and psychological mappings."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Fairwood reflects this dilemma because in order to reach her epiphany, she must revalue ancient Greek cultural achievement with respect to Egypt's.  </p>

<p>"Secret Name" also compares Egyptian lotus bud columns to Classical Greek architecture: "Great fervid buds, not like the columns of the Greeks that hold in their straight fair line a sort of challenge, not an appeal so much as a command to the intellect to soar up and up. These bulbous buds, enormous, pregnant, seemed endowed after these four thousand years with some inner life; to hold that possibility of sudden bloom-burst" (<i>P, </i>213). As with Tut's golden chariot wheel, Fairwood perceives that these columns incarnate a living spirituality so that their power results from neither intellect nor fascination. Meredith Miller argues that H.D.'s language challenges art 

<b></b>

 critic T. E. Hulme's "binary distinction" between Egyptian hardness and Greek vitality.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Other parts of "Secret Name" also interrogate prevailing cultural refinement narratives, assigning "starkness" to the Greek rather than Egyptian side: "It was utterly Athenian starkly to define, to outline in terms of thought every human emotion, not making allowance for this intermediate state where shadows of bronze palms were soft and fern-like, where thought and emotion were delicately merged" (<i>P,</i> 193). This characterization sharply contrasts W. B. Yeats's story of Western art's emergence in "Under Ben Bulben": "Measurement began our might: / Forms a stark Egyptian thought, / Forms that gentler Phidias wrought."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  H. D.'s Egypto-modernism begins when Karnak challenges her contemporaries' cultural investment in Greece, including her male compatriots Pound and Eliot. As Breasted noted in his groundbreaking 1916 textbook <i>Ancient Times,</i> "the habit of regarding ancient history as beginning with Greece has become so fixed that it is not easily to be changed."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  </p>

<p>H. D. was not the only American poet who incorporated Egyptian artifacts into her writing, but she placed them into fuller archaeological contexts than her peers and predecessors. This quality distinguishes her work from Marianne Moore's object-centered "An Egyptian Pulled Glass Bottle in the Shape of a Fish," in which the artifact operates primarily as a re for poetry. H. D.'s mythic references to Egypt are similarly grounded, so that her allusions to <i>The Book of the Dead </i>are not as displaced as those in Muriel Rukeyser's documentary poem of the same name (which memorializes a mining disaster). Walt Whitman anticipates some aspects of H. D.'s Egypto-modernism, although he never traveled to Egypt. In "Salut du Monde!," for example, he marvels at hieroglyphic inscriptions as a kind of stone papyrus: "I look on chisell'd histories, records of conquering kings, dynasties, cut in slabs of sand-stone, or on granite-blocks." As John Irwin notes, Whitman read widely in Egyptology during the 1840s and 1850s, and was a frequent visitor at Dr. Abbott's museum of Egyptology in New York.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  H. D. and her partner Bryher had many books on Egyptology in their library, which included studies of hieroglyphics, mythology, history, and material culture. Besides Breasted's studies, they owned Janet R. Buttles's <i>The Queens of Egypt</i> , Arthur E. P. Weigall's <i>A Guide to the Antiquities of Upper Egypt</i> , A. Bothwell Gosse's <i>The Civilization of the Ancient Egyptians</i> , Mary G. Houston and Florence S. Hornblower's <i>Ancient Egyptian, Assyrian and Persian Costumes &amp; Decorations</i> , Margaret Alice Murray's <i>Egyptian Sculpture</i> , and A. Lucas's <i>Ancient Egyptian Materials .</i> The library also contained several books by E. A. Wallis Budge, including <i>The Dwellers on the Nile</i> , <i>Easy Lessons in Egyptian Hieroglyphics</i> , <i>Egyptian Religion</i> , <i>Egyptian Literature</i> , <i>The Egyptian Heaven and Hell</i> , <i>Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection</i> , and <i>The Book of the Dead: An English Translation</i> .<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Because Budge was such a prolific publisher, it is not surprising that he is so well represented in H. D.'s collection. The few critics who address H. D.'s relationship to Egyptology focus almost exclusively on Budge, but his views were by no means the dominant perspective on ancient Egypt at this time. <b></b></p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Debates within Academic Egyptology
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Modernist Egyptology was an international discipline of competing claims on Egypt's sites and artifacts, and conflicting interpretations of their significance. As the major colonizing powers in the region, European nationals took the lead in these endeavors. The development of a sophisticated ancient culture on non-European (especially African) soil posed a major dilemma, casting doubt upon the hitherto accepted superiority of the West. Scholars partially solved this problem by dislocating Egypt from continental Africa, placing it instead within the cultural milieu of the Orient (variously termed the Ancient Near East, or the Near Orient). So widely accepted was this cartography that Nancy Cunard's influential <i>Negro</i> anthology omitted Egypt from its map of Africa. A corollary of this view was that Egyptian civilization was not indigenous and therefore required an outside impetus for its development. In the late nineteenth century, for example, British archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie proposed conquest by a "Dynastic Race" as the civilizing catalyst, basing his theory on skeletal remains.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Such formulations date back to the mid nineteenth century, when Americans used phrenology to justify slavery. Although Petrie's theory would be discredited, the debate over indigenous or nonindigenous development continued to be an important one for two of the most prominent Egyptologists of the modernist era: Budge and Breasted. </p>

<p>Budge believed that a savage native population was civilized by invaders from the East, while Breasted believed that Egyptian civilization was indigenous and influenced the East. Because Breasted's chain of cultural influence began with Egypt, it became the source rather than the recipient of civilization. Disagreeing with Budge was not unusual for Breasted. Key differences also appear in both men's interpretation of Egyptian religion. Breasted admired the pharaoh Akhenaten's transformation of Egypt's solar religion from polytheism, viewing this change as a precedent for Western monotheism. In contrast, Budge positioned it—and indeed dynastic civilization itself—as the result of "an Asiatic element" which "invaded the country and conquer[ed] the natives"—a people he saw as fundamentally primitive. Indeed, Budge argued in 1904 that the Egyptians could not "become metaphysicians in the modern sense of the word . . . the mere construction of the language would make such a thing impossible, to say nothing of the ideas of the great Greek philosophers, which belong to a domain of thought and culture wholly foreign to the Egyptian."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Thus for Budge, the primitivism he perceived in the ancient Egyptians compromised their cultural achievements. </p>

<p>While Budge argued that Egypt's ancient civilization came from elsewhere, Australian scholar Sir Grafton Elliot Smith took the opposite view that its influence extended practically everywhere. Advocating for an extreme version of Egyptian primacy, Smith proposed a "hyperdiffusionist" theory that affirmed Egyptian technological presence in the pre-conquest civilizations of the New World—and in areas as remote from Egypt as Oceania. Smith denied critics' charges that he attributed "the customs and beliefs of the whole world to Egypt."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  However, in outlining his theories in a series of books beginning with <i>The Migration of Early Cultures</i> , he dismissed the contemporary theory of independent invention. As far as Smith was concerned, if embalming was 

<b></b>

 practiced in Peru and Egypt then Egypt had to be the source. His map of the transmission of technologies published in <i>The Diffusion of Culture</i> links Egypt directly to almost every region of the earth. Modernist Egyptology could be "wildly inventive," as Alice Gambrell notes, even within scholarly communities.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Because the U.S. was a relative newcomer in academic Egyptology, Breasted often took an adversarial stance towards his international counterparts, especially Budge. He noted in his journal that Egyptology had "only a handful of <i>competent</i> followers, and even these often disagreed violently among themselves in fundamental matters of chronology, philology, archaeology and history" (qtd. in <i>PP,</i> 85). Having trained in Germany Breasted had a high regard for the Berlin school, which emphasized close and careful translation. By contrast, he had little respect for Budge. Breasted in fact considered Britain's prolific scholar to be incompetent, despite his prestigious post as Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities for the British Museum. To Breasted the inadequacies of the British Museum reflected Budge's own work: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I showed him one of the most important monuments in the entire collection, so ridiculously labeled that it was evident those who had installed it knew nothing about it. Budge himself now showed that he was ignorant of it. . . . He . . . pled the onerous duties of his office—the labels were old, put on before his time, etc., etc. But his own books, filled with egregious errors, belied him. </p>

	<div class="attrib">
[qtd. in <i>PP,</i> 84]
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Reporting on his own survey of Nubia in 1905–1906, Breasted repeatedly chronicles Budge's erroneous conclusions about the date and significance of monuments (<a href="#2"> 2</a>).<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Other contemporary scholars also denigrated Budge for inaccurate and careless translations since he persisted in using an antiquated system of transcription. In addition, Budge's many excavations, while garnering numerous artifacts for the British Museum, were criticized for lack of scholarly rigor. In contrast Breasted was noted for his careful translation of hieroglyphic texts (many of which are still used today), and his sponsorship of systematic excavations. Vincent Arieh Tobin's recent characterization of Breasted's <i>Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt </i>is a case in point: "Although published originally in 1912, this work is still a classic study of Egyptian religion and myth and is well worth a careful reading."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  H. D.'s critics have tended to elide scholarly Egyptology with Budge—a problematic position given his compromised status within the academy. </p>

<p>Breasted's disagreements with Budge did not extend to countering the prevailing scholarly opinion about race, which separated Egypt from Africa and by inference from Negro America. Although Breasted positioned Egypt as foundational to Western culture, he mirrored the contemporary racial climate in assigning whiteness to its ancient inhabitants. We see this ideology as late as 1941, when <i>National Geographic </i>illustrations for "Daily Life in Ancient Egypt" depict its inhabitants as "a light-colored, not even very suntanned people," as Bruce Trigger notes.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Breasted considered the Egyptians to be part of what he terms "The Great Northwest Quadrant," a geographical area which includes the Mediterranean and whose inhabitants "as far back as we <b></b> </p>

know anything  about prehistoric men, have all been members of the white race." This Quadrant is "bordered on the east by the Mongoloids and south by the Negroes." While Breasted admits that these two groups "occupy an important place in the modern world," he denies any contribution on their part to the development of <i>Western</i> civilization. He does allow that the Chinese branch of the Mongoloids created an "impressive" civilization in their own right, but equates the Negroes with the "teeming black world of Africa," who neither influenced nor were influenced by Egypt—and thus lacked 

<b></b>

 civilization (<i>CC, </i>43–45). Such racial constructions grow out of debates within mid-nineteenth-century Egyptology which, as Malini Johar Schueller argues, "generated anxieties about the capabilities of different races in the United States."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Breasted's separation of Egypt from Black Africa and the (American) Negro would surely have facilitated his acceptance among the general public. </p>

<p>Establishing Egyptology as a university discipline in the United States, Breasted developed the influential New Past theory, which promoted Egypt as foundational for western civilization. For Breasted the New Past made it possible to view "an imposing panorama of the human career in a vista of successive ages such as no earlier generation has ever been able to survey."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As the first link in the chain, Egypt was responsible for nothing less than "the emergence of civilization, the most important event that has yet occurred in the universe so far as it is known to us" (<i>CC,</i> 7). Thus Breasted never equated ancient Egypt with primitivism—a feature that distinguishes his work from Freud's recapitulation theory, as well as from Schnapp, Shanks, and Tiew's view that archaeology posits "evolutionary schemes" of "an earlier, more primitive stage."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  In particular Breasted praised Egypt's invention of hieroglyphic writing as "having had a greater influence in uplifting the human race than any other intellectual achievement in the career of man" (<i>CC, </i>61). This foregrounding of Egypt marks a major shift from the traditional emphasis on the Classical past or Biblical tradition as the sources of Western civilization—what we might term the old past. </p>

<p>Rather than requiring the direct contact advocated by Smith, the New Past viewed civilization as a "rising trail" extending from Egypt to modern America. Breasted distilled this theory in his design for the sculpted tympanum over the entrance to the Oriental Institute, titled "The East Teaching the West (<a href="#3"> 3</a>)." The two central res are, on the left, an Egyptian scribe (identifiable by the writing paraphernalia slung over his shoulder), and on the right, a WPA-styled American man. The scribe and his important gift (writing) represent the East; note the men from other ancient civilizations (Persian, Assyrian, Babylonian) shown behind him. The scribe also holds a fragment from a temple wall—symbol of the importance of monumental architecture as both an enduring surface for writing, and a major element of human achievement in its own right. The significance of Egyptian architecture is further emphasized by the choice of a lotus bud column capital (lying behind the Egyptian scribe), which is identical to those from the Amun temple complex at Karnak. While a pyramid would be a more iconic choice for representing Egypt (there is a small pyramid on the left side), Breasted chooses a column to further link Egypt and the West. Columns, important elements of the Greco-Roman architectural vocabulary, are ultimately derived from Egypt. </p>

<p>The sun with suspended ankh symbols and rays ending in human hands fills the central area above both res. This image comes from the religion of the eighteenth-dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten, revered by Breasted and many Western scholars of his time as the first monotheist. Breasted's march of civilization is thus connected to the Hebrew/Western conception of God the Father. By placing his sculptural decoration in a tympanum, Breasted also alludes to Christian sacred architecture. He saw in the Amun temple's Hypostyle Hall the source of "the columned nave and side aisles" of European 

<b></b>

 cathedrals: "Egypt furnished the later world with this beautiful architectural form."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Indeed, the use of relief sculpture in the tympanum is in itself a tribute to Egyptian cultural primacy, since the practice of decorating buildings in this way goes back from cathedrals to Classical and Near Eastern civilizations, and ultimately to Egypt. </p>

<p>The Egyptian scribe dwarfs the representatives of the other Near Eastern civilizations just as, according to the New Past theory, Egypt's civilization surpassed theirs. Similarly, American man's size suggests that his civilization will (or is) surpassing the Western civilizations of Greece and Rome depicted behind him on the right. While the American Man and Egyptian scribe are the same size, subtle stylistic devices indicate that American will surpass his Egyptian counterpart. Borrowing compositional techniques from ancient Egyptian sculpture used to express dominance, Breasted's design emphasizes American man by placing his left foot in front of the scribe's so that his bent knee intrudes into the center of the frame. In effect, modern America is poised to assume ancient Egypt's legacy and continue the march of civilization. As Breasted sees it, Egypt offers a site through which his own newer, American culture can enter the panorama of history, ultimately usurping Europe's position and becoming the culmination of Western civilization's development. </p>

<p>H. D.'s writing shows an awareness of debates within Egyptology—especially those involving nationality, geography and race. The name of her "famous Egyptologist" in "Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt" (Bodge-Grafton) combines Budge and Grafton Elliot Smith. This wordplay suggests not only that Budge "botched" his interpretations, as Sarah Witte has noted, but also signals ideological splits within the field of Egyptology more generally.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Ironically, this fictional Egyptologist represents "the amethyst 

<b></b>

 Athenian values" from which the protagonist—his Classically-trained research assistant—must free herself. He leaves with his "disappointed party" when the Tutankhamun excavations force him to modify his "monumental and final volume" (<i>P, </i>190). Although she does not invoke Breasted directly, H. D.'s rendering of Bodge-Grafton intersects with his Egypto-modernist departures from Classical frameworks.  </p>

<p>H. D.'s conceptions of ancient Egypt were more fluid than Breasted's, shifting back and forth between Eastern and African, white and black. In the "Secret Name" story, Egypt straddles Eastern and African inflections. A bejeweled Orientalism infuses Helen Fairwood's account of Amenophis II's burial chamber, which H. D. res as "a moon opal" housing the "exquisite gem, black opal" of the pharaoh's body. The protagonist likens this cultural "inheritance" to another opal fixed on her forehead, appropriating Eastern culture for herself as Miller has argued. At the same time, Fairwood's sense of being in Africa makes her feel "comforted" because she feels that its "unfamiliar" and "innumerable" stars place her closer to the sun—and thus closer to the source of divinity. Godhood as well as racial difference make Egypt seem "another planet" (<i>P, </i>183, 211, 226). In <i>Tribute to Freud,</i> H. D.'s dream re of an ancient Egyptian princess hovers between definite Eastern inflections (she wears an Indian sari) and racial ambiguity (she is a "dark lady"). As Friedman has argued, H. D.'s linking of dark and female others reflects a "modernism of the 'scattered remnant'" that sometimes breaks with Eurocentric racial hierarchies.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The protagonist of <i>Helen in Egypt</i> "blacken[s] her face like the prophetic <i>femme noire</i> of antiquity" (<i>HE,</i> 15)―an act which, as Susan Edmunds suggests, renders a black Egyptian Helen through "a moment of actual racial conversion."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In her most multiracial ration—and H. D.'s starkest contrast from Breasted—the African-American maid character in<i> HER</i> manifests ancient Egypt, as well as Roman and Etruscan attributes; this combination departs from both popular and academic versions of ancient Egypt.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  H. D.'s mergings of black Africa with Classical antiquity intersect somewhat with the Afrocentrism that Cheikh Anta Diop posited in his 1951 thesis, which considered Egypt to be the first black civilization. While it would be going too far to label H. D.'s Egypto-modernism Afrocentric, it does avoid some of the rigid racial distinctions that Martin Bernal has traced in Western scholarship on ancient Egypt and Classical antiquity.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Consequently, H. D.'s Egypt will never rest squarely on either side of the dualities with which her contemporaries defined it. H. D.'s model of cultural influence was not as linear as Breasted's because, as Gregory has noted, it involved "dissemination, dispersion, and diaspora," but neither was it as diffuse as Smith's.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">

<p>Although Breasted and H. D. approached Egypt from their respective vantage points of cross-Atlantic intellectual movements—modernist Egyptology and art—their American national identities played a more significant role in their perceptions than many critics acknowledge. Breasted's writings especially convey a sense that Americans 

<b></b>

 are uniquely suited to perceive cultural kinship with the ancient Egyptians. This results not only from an imperialist belief in "Egypt as Western inheritance," as Miller notes, but also from each writer's transposition of America's mythic West onto the expansiveness of Karnak.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  </p>

<p>For Breasted and H. D., Egypt was not "the 'Gateway to India'" and "foothold" that it constituted for Britain and Continental Europe.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Although neither embraced the idea of Egyptian independence, both writers give negative impressions of British soldiers and officials in their accounts of archaeological sites. In his journals, for example, Breasted wrote of "the fundamental Philistinism of the British government"; he was especially angry that a Nile dam project would ruin Ptolemaic relics (qtd. in <i>PP, </i>143). H. D. diminishes British characters in "Secret Name: Excavator's Egypt." As noted above, Bodge-Grafton is expelled from the story when his research is disproved. Another minor character, Jerry Cope, sports "a totally overdone school-boy affectation," engaging in "monkey-like" antics that break the spell of Karnak's Amun temple (<i>P,</i> 212). More pertinent to the story, Helen Fairwood will ultimately reject as guide and companion the British Captain Rafton, Great War veteran and Public Works administrator in Cairo. In short the British characters are either ridiculed or rejected, thus clearing space for an American reappraisal of Egypt's ancient sites. Both find Egypt's cultural legacy especially significant during a period of shifting cultural hegemony to the United States. </p>

<p>The title of Charles Breasted's biography of his father—<i>Pioneer to the Past</i>—reflects the Egyptologist's sense of Western civilization as a "rising trail" leading westward to America. Early on the biographer characterizes his father as "a lone young American Egyptologist pitted against the rather self-superior complacency of Old World scholarship" (<i>PP,</i> 65). As Gerry Scott explains, the fact that Europe rather than America played the "major role" in discoveries, excavations, and epigraphy often prompted a discourse of "adventurous travel" rather than scientific inquiry.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  As pioneer to Egypt's past, Breasted also faced the challenge of steering his fellow citizens into regions largely unknown to them except in the popular imagination: "In America, Egypt really did not exist at all—and here was I, proposing single-handedly to introduce it into a Middle Western community which for the most part did not even know the origin of the names Cairo, Illinois, and Memphis, Tennessee" (qtd. in <i>PP,</i> 85). His solution to this dilemma would link the rise of Egyptian civilization to American Manifest Destiny. "Just as in America," he asserted before the American Historical Association in 1928, Egypt had forged "a great society" from the "wilderness." Clearing indigenous peoples from the American West, Breasted's address reinscribes constructions of an antithetical East to justify a "New Crusade" of "scientific effort in the ancient Orient." Breasted sought to inspire recruits ("modern pilgrims") for the Oriental Institute's archaeological surveys, so he extolled his audience to "set their faces to the East." And yet Breasted's sense of "returning to ancestral shores" also implies kinship with Egypt, so that going East opens up a new American frontier.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  One might dismiss Breasted's nationalism as a rhetorical device to open the hearts and pockets of his American audience, but it proves a major trope in his writing as a whole. In <i>The Dawn of Conscience,</i> for example, 

<b></b>

 Breasted interposes the Biblical world as an intermediate phase between ancient Egypt and "modern Man," who was best exemplified by America (<i>DC,</i> 13). Throughout his career, he drew consistent parallels between Egypt (fertile ground for the world's first civilization) and America (the next great step in the West's development).  </p>

<p>H. D. also perceived traveling to Egypt as a kind of homecoming, but for her the issue of Americanness is more vexed because of her extended expatriatism. She constructs an American Nile most fully when depicting the ways in which archaeological sites stimulate Helen Fairwood's awareness of her latent national identity. For much of the narrative, H. D.'s protagonist occupies a transnational identity that shifts on the ancient plane between Greece and Egypt, and on the modern plane between America and England. Just as she initially represses her newfound admiration of Egypt, Fairwood also represses her Americanness. For example, she refuses to join in Jerry Cope's attempts at American slang, and recoils when Mary Thorpe's mother speaks confidentially to her in the manner of "any American." Repelled by the party of nouveau-riche American tourists and their "ice-and-lemonade civilisation," Fairwood nonetheless concedes that New York "couldn't in the march of civilisations be brushed aside." Thus like Breasted, H. D. sees the U.S. as the West's emergent civilization. Fairwood will also come to acknowledge the American sensibility that has traveled with her: "Here in Egypt across her room in Luxor, America, herself gazed, as in the mirror a moment since at herself. It faced her, herself, her own school; names" (<i>P, </i>195, 185, 199). Ultimately she is drawn to Mary Thorpe not only because of her gender, the reason other critics have emphasized, but also because of their shared nationality. In fact, Fairwood grounds this link by thinking of her young compatriot as "Maryland." </p>

<p>Mary's presence prompts Helen Fairwood to envision an American Nile on both of her visits to Karnak. She frames her first entry through the Avenue of the Sphinxes with "the gigantic stretches" of her childhood New Jersey shore: "the incurve of the sand about these sphinxes is somehow familiar." (This passage anticipates H. D.'s plea for the god Amen-Ra to take her "home" to the Nile in <i>Trilogy.</i>) Leaving the site, Fairwood feels that "eventually one must surely reach a sea, the rim of a New Jersey seacoast." Her second visit to Karnak, this time with Mary as her sole companion, triggers iconic images of the American West. Fairwood sees the two American women as characters in "some Wild West show" who had ridden "across strange fields where buffalo were grazing." Significantly, it is with Mary that Fairwood finally achieves a fully satisfying encounter with monumental Egypt. The two of them, Helen perceives, constitute a feminized version of the American Western hero: "this type, this American, beaten and weathered machine type, thin as rails, steel-bone and sinew, that mounted ponies and endured the change of tropic and zero weather. . . " <i>(P, </i>203–4, 218, 235, 231). Like Breasted's sense of himself as a pioneer, H. D.'s characterization of Helen and Mary reflects the "distinctly American trait" of rugged individualism that Scott sees inflecting American approaches to Egyptology in the nineteenth century.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Paradoxically, the closing of the American frontier in 1890 expanded its mythic boundaries in the American imagination, enabling Breasted and H. D. to invoke it as a means of extending America's past to ancient Egypt.

<h1 class="sec-headA">
Advocating for a New Past
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Although monumental Egypt prompted H. D. and especially Breasted to articulate their American identities, these advocates for Egyptian cultural primacy often assumed that their respective audiences would disagree with them. This perception arose in part from the fundamental role the Bible played in U.S. nationalism. According to his son's biography, Breasted's textbook <i>Ancient Times</i> was denounced by Scopes Trial prosecutor William Jennings Bryan for supposedly destroying the nation's Christian faith (<i>PP,</i> 230). The New Past Theory attributes nothing less than the development of moral conscience to ancient Egypt rather than the traditional Biblical sources. In reading Egyptian literature, Breasted found that "the Egyptians had possessed a standard of morals far superior to that of the Decalogue over a thousand years before the Decalogue was written." He also relates his boyhood puzzlement at the lack of a commandment against lying, considering this a fundamental flaw in Biblical morality (<i>DC, </i>xii). H. D. effects a similar revaluation of ancient Egypt in <i>Trilogy,</i> which asserts that the Egyptian god Amun "is our Christos" and "not at all like Jehovah."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Working through layers of ancient Mediterranean cultures in the first section, H. D. reveals the Egyptian precedents for Classical and Christian symbols; for example, Pharaoh's "erect king-cobra crest" lies beneath both the Greek caduceus and the Christian Tau cross with Brazen Serpent (<i>T,</i> 13). H. D. "turned repeatedly to Egypt as a symbol for the sacred," as Friedman notes."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  And like Breasted, her Biblical knowledge enhanced rather than diminished her appreciation of ancient Egyptian spirituality. </p>

<p>H. D. anticipates considerable resistance to her fullest articulations of Egypto-modernism: <i>Trilogy</i> and <i>Helen in Egypt.</i> Like other "impure" influences that Gregory and Cassandra Laity have discussed (Alexandrian Hellenism and Decadent Romanticism, respectively), her advocacy for Egypt would prove suspect to Eliot and Pound.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  In <i>Trilogy</i> the speaker-as-scribe defends ancient Egypt from an adversarial "you" that views Isis as "a harlot," sacred symbols as "charms," and divine Egyptian headdress as "trivial/intellectual adornment" (<i>T, </i>5, 14). In <i>Helen in Egypt,</i> all the male characters accost the protagonist for her new Egyptian identity. Achilles rebukes Helen in the very first section: "O cursèd, O envious Isis, / you—you—a vulture, a hieroglyph" . Paris perceives that Helen is tainted with "Egyptian incense," while Theseus fears that Egyptian influences destroy Greek rationality: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">

<p class="continued">As home to the Minotaur, Crete's Labyrinth is domain of darkness, bestiality, and corruption—the antithesis to Helen's (and H. D.'s) sacred Amun temple. Significantly, Theseus's labyrinthine image of Egypt also intersects with a major point of contention 

<b></b>

 for archaeologists in the modernist period. While some saw Crete as Europe's first autonomous civilized society, Breasted and others posited Egypt as the island's civilizing force (CC, 89). Although H. D.'s advocacy for Egypt is always put on the defensive, her Egypto-Modernism allowed her to write outside the confines of Classical warrior band myths. As Dianne Chisholm points out, H.D.'s revisionary writing, unlike Western literary history, is not dominated by the Greek text."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Thus it is her Egyptian influences, as well as her female protagonist, that make <i>Helen in Egypt</i> an alternative modern epic. </p>

<p>Egypt's ancient archaeological sites—especially Karnak—gave H. D. and Breasted a generative space in which to create new pasts unencumbered by the weight of traditional Eurocentric frameworks. For them Egypt became paradoxically ancient and new: "the same—different—the same attributes, / different yet the same as before," as H. D. writes (<i>T,</i> 105). The need for a regenerative past became more urgent in the face of global war, prompting Breasted and H. D. to view Egypt as a source of spiritual stability. Stricken by the carnage of World War I and cognizant of the emerging crisis in Europe during the early 1930s, Breasted wrote <i>The Dawn of Conscience</i> as an antidote to the horrors of war. In the foreword to this history of moral thought, he asserts: "The World War has now demonstrated the appalling possibilities of man's mechanical power of destruction. The only force that can successfully oppose it is the human conscience" that originated in Egypt (<i>DC,</i> ix). With Europe on the verge of ruin once more, Breasted sees an unscathed America ready to inherit an older source—and renew the West's usable past. If the Old World and its past are in effect dead, "the stone papyrus" of Karnak will "continue to prophesy," as H. D. writes in <i>Trilogy.</i> Excavating backward from Blitz-torn London through the remains of Pompeii and ultimately to Egypt, H.D. senses that Karnak's inscribed hieroglyphs still "pursue unalterable purpose." When the speaker-scribe asserts that "Pompeii has nothing to teach us," she means not only that Londoners know too much of airborne destruction, but also that the Classical past proves insufficient for facing it—and for healing what will remain (<i>T,</i> 3, 4). As a whole <i>Trilogy</i> effects a perpetual return to Egypt, beginning at Karnak and ending just before the Christian Holy Family flees from Herod to the Nile. While H. D. never discounted the legacies of Classical poetry and Hellenic beauty, Egypt allowed her war poems to "rearrange a culture in crisis," to borrow Adalaide Morris's evocative phrase.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Malleable in a way that the Classical tradition can never be, Egypto-modernism allowed Breasted and H. D. to rewrite traditional narratives of Western culture by making Egypt its source and spiritual center. In their memorial tribute to Breasted, Ludlow Bull, Ephraim Speiser and Albert TenEyck Olmstead noted: "He often said that, much as he admired the marvellous contributions of Greece to art and philosophy, he was weary of the prevalent belief among educated laymen that 'everything began with the Greeks.'"<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  H.D.'s surrogate Helen Fairwood starts off with this view, but comes to accept that "<i>The Greeks came to Egypt to learn"</i> (<i>P, </i>217). Reading H. D. through Breasted reveals that modernist Egyptology was a major influence on her career, surely as important as the psychoanalytic frameworks that have dominated H. D. studies. While Breasted was not 

<b></b>

 the only professional Egyptologist who influenced H. D., his advocacy for Egypt and the New Past is similar to the Egypto-modernist perspective she would develop after <i>Palimpsest.</i> As we have seen, ancient Egypt held plural and even conflicting meanings in popular, literary, and intellectual discourse of the modernist period—despite the immense stability of its dynastic culture across millennia. Ideologically-inflected accounts of Egypt were hardly limited to its emergence from British colonial rule. By recovering H. D.'s intersections with academic Egyptology—especially its emergence in the United States—we can situate her career more fully within modernist intellectual history. </p>
