I am not able to share your opinion that the new course in Germany might
be only a nightmare lasting a few months. I am filled with the deepest
pessimism because I believe that only now will we pay the price for
underestimating the opponent, that only now will we see that they will
maintain a better, firmer, and more ruthless hold on everything than
the republicans ever dared to do during 15 years. . . . I believe that
we should be prepared for anything and then let destiny take its course.

This movement has so much that is healthy and positive that one can
regard the artistic and other consequences quite calmly. The battle is
directed primarily against the communists and Jews, whose influence is
being checked to a considerable degree. A welcome cleaning-up has been
undertaken . . . in an attempt to restore decency and order. No doubt
there will be a reaction here against non-German art, but the really
valuable will again be recognized as before. You must not worry about

All good music since 1850, T. W. Adorno repeatedly asserted, has renounced
commercialism altogether. Extrapolating from Arnold Schoenberg's 1927
dictum that "in the end, art and success have to part company," Adorno
succinctly articulated an aesthetic axiom central to modernist ideology:
worthwhile art music either floats, unsullied in its autonomy, above
economics, politics, and commerce or critically resists its origins and
contexts by its very existence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 While popular musics are necessarily



conditioned by the marketplace and are always, as merchandise, subject
to the imperatives of commerce, "good music" exists in a pure state as
"art for art's sake." Because it formulates and then obeys its own laws,
this music transcends its contexts and "represents a triumph over the
world and not a mere reflection of it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Adhering to this axiom, most historical accounts of music in the
 twentieth century to date have privileged musical composition over
 other musical activities, including performance, publication, and
 reception. For example, such bias, unacknowledged and unstated in Arnold
 Whittall's <I>Music Since the First World War</I>, is manifest in the
 title of the revised and expanded imprint of 1999, <I>Musical Composition
 in the Twentieth Century</I>. In his "Millennial Prelude" to the volume,
 Whittall reaffirms his approach while making a perfunctory disclaimer:
 "Even if much of my own text may appear to subscribe to the outmoded
 heresy of autonomy, treating its chosen compositions in isolation from
 any contexts other than the particular technical features selected
 by the author, some hint of the world outside the work will break
 in from time to time. . . . It will, I hope, be obvious that a text
 conceived in the way I have described cannot be regarded as a history
 of twentieth-century music."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The cultural practice of publishing new music in the twentieth
century, in particular, has received scant scholarly attention. In
fact, the reproduction, promotion, dissemination, exploitation, and
protection of modern art music has been studied far less than analogous
publication-related activities in the eras of Monteverdi and Mozart.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Yet, what is at stake in charting the course of music publication in the
 twentieth century is not just a more complete empirical description of
 musical commerce, as important as that might be, but rather a basis for
 reconsidering the continuities and discontinuities in the historical
 arc extending from the heady pre-War days of Weimar experimentation,
 through National Socialist political appropriation of music as the
 "most German of the arts," to the post-War "tyranny" of Darmstadt
 serialism. Now that the "modernist project" is being subjected to closer
 scrutiny, it is becoming clear that the process of composing music
 and getting it performed (the good, bad, and ugly alike) was usually
 conditioned as much by practical and financial considerations as it was
 by artistic impulse. During the twentieth century the publication of
 contemporary music has been, in fact, big business. For example, Schott
 Musik International, headquartered in Mainz, reports on its website:
 "With a permanent staff of about 250 employees and 150 free-lancers,
 and offices in Hong Kong, London, Madrid, New York, Paris, Tokyo,
 Toronto and Zurich, Schott Musik International is today one of the
 biggest publishing houses of serious music in the classical tradition."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music publishing entails large capital investments, big risks, and high
stakes. As protection of intellectual property was gradually expanded
and extended, publishers entrusted with copyrights enjoyed virtual
monopolies over artistic products that substantially outlived their
creators. Even investments in a composer who claimed to be writing for
a time fifty years after his death could be amortized over a period of
protection lasting a century or more, with reasonable expectations of
eventual recoupment or even profit. But speculation in the music market
was no less uncertain a gamble than that in commodities, currencies,
or securities. Care, subsidy, and mentoring of

<B></B>

composers, preparation of performance materials, dissemination
of printed scores, and ongoing promotion, accounting, and
copyright administration were expensive undertakings, with
no guarantees against the vagaries of taste or much direct
influence over the vicissitudes of performing organizations and
institutions. Publishers counted on short-term sensations like
<I>Jonny spielt auf</I> to offset the costs of slow starters
such as <I>Wozzeck</I>. The fruits from the rare everbearers,
such as <I>Carmina Burana</I> (whose earnings consistently exceed
a million dollars annually), and <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I> (earning
several hundred thousand dollars annually) subsidized the printing
and warehousing of hundreds of scores and sets of parts that
did little more than gather dust on the shelves. A few such stocks,
including Mahler's symphonies and Schoenberg's <I>Erwartung</I>, turned
out to be "sleepers," lying dormant in the portfolio for decades before
skyrocketing in value and paying off handsomely in the long term.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even the most reckless firms hedged their bets with endeavors
less volatile than new music: <I>Urtext</I> editions of "classic"
steady earners, perennially in-demand pedagogical materials, music for
proliferating organizations of amateurs, youths, soldiers, and workers. As
the "democratizing" new media of recordings, radio, and sound films
tantalized with the potential of a mass audience for "serious" music,
upstarts such as Universal Edition (UE) and B&auml;renreiter competed
within a brave new world with such venerable companies as B. Schott's
S&ouml;hne (Schott) and Breitkopf &amp; H&auml;rtel. Germany started
the century as the undisputed center of music publishing (with Leipzig
as its capital). By the end of the Weimar period, Schott and UE had
emerged as the principal rivals for the publication of new music in
Central Europe. As Hans Heinsheimer observed firsthand, "The truly
spectacular battles between the big music publishers, mainly between
the Schotts of Mainz, led by at least one Strecker, and the Universals
of Vienna . . . were fought at the international festivals, the trade
fairs of contemporary music. It was ferocious and merciless warfare,
marvelous to watch and highly enjoyable to participate in. . . . When
they met in hotel lobbies or concerts, they greeted each other with
teeth-grinding exuberance and evil smiles."

Soon, however, genuine international festivals were listed among the
"great sins of the time" that had corrupted "the domain of an art that
until then had been seen throughout the world as the most German of
all." In his speech that opened the "Entartete Musik" Exhibition in
D&uuml;ssseldorf in May 1938, Joseph Goebbels continued: "A certain
period of transition was thus required to remove the errors, failures,
and manifestations of decline through the cultivation of the true artistic
strengths of our German music. . . . The German masters, who with true
artistic command had created immortal works of German tonal art, were
suppressed by the flagrantly commercial elements of international Jewry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The following year, Peter Raabe, then president of the Reichsmusikkammer
 (the Reich Chamber of Music), specifically identified the fate of German
 music with that of German armies: "Not only musicians participated
 in the fate of German music, but all Germans, inasmuch as the people
 of Bach, Beethoven and Bruckner [are] in no other art as superior to
 other peoples as in music. To protect this music against all current
 dangers must be a sacred obligation of all those remaining at home,
 while the army has left to protect [the] country and the

<B></B>

people to which fate has accorded the wonderful and magnificent gift:
German music." A poster captioned "Das Land der Musik" makes explicit
this link between military muscle and the wonderful gift of German
music; it features a gigantic <I>Reichsadler</I> (Eagle of the Reich)
as an acoustic backdrop with organ pipe feathers (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_1.html"> 1</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Though the arts were thus anything but peripheral to the ideology and
propaganda of National Socialism, attempts at regulation and coordination
(<I>Gleichschaltung</I>) of music in general and music publishing in
particular had nevertheless been improvisatory, lethargic, and haphazard
for much of the 1930s. Situated precisely in the bureaucratic cracks
between culture and commerce, where the interests of Goebbel's Ministry
of Propaganda intersected and conflicted with those of the Ministry of
Economics, the six hundred members of the <I>Fachverband</I> (Assembly
for a Specialized Field of Activity) for music publishing comprised by
far the smallest sector of the 95,000-member Reichsmusikkammer, which
required all who participated in the "creation, reproduction,

<B></B>

intellectual or technical processing, dissemination, preservation,
and sale of cultural goods" to join.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Founded on the principle of self-administration under state
 supervision, but hampered by inadequate self-financing from dues,
 the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) initially depended
 on artists and organizations to cooperate voluntarily with the regime
 and to police themselves--even though only 21% of its members would
 eventually join the National Socialist Party.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Several of Goebbels's initiatives, including extension of copyright
protection in 1934 from thirty to fifty years post-mortem, directly
benefitted composers and their publishers. Subsequently the
Reichsmusikkammer provided an ongoing subsidy for the purchase of
contemporary music by provincial performing organizations. When the
Propaganda Ministry began to monitor musical performances more closely,
it issued, in September 1935, a list of "musical works allowed under no
circumstances, neither to be publicly performed nor broadcast." However,
there seems to have been no comparable ban on the printing or sale of
this music, other than an initial directive requiring chamber screening
before publication or dissemination of printed music composed by
"persons who have left the German Reich after the seizure of power by
National Socialism" (<I>AIENG</I>, 139). Even after the Nuremburg Laws
forced the purging of 2,202 non-Aryan members of the Reichsmusikkammer
in 1936, exceptions were made in the cases of seventeen non-Aryan music
publishers, including the prominent firms of F&uuml;rstner and Peters,
which remained in Jewish hands for several more years. (This proved so
embarrassing to the Propaganda Ministry that it directed the German
press to avoid calling attention to the situation) (<I>AIENG</I>,
112). Non-Aryan music publishers and music dealers were Aryanized only
gradually in the late 1930s. By then, a Reichsmusikpr&uuml;fstelle
(Reich Music Examining Board) had been established to review all music
planned for German distribution. But the enormity of such a task soon
overwhelmed the staff of four and persuaded Reichsmusikkammer president
Peter Raabe to modify the directive so that music publishers would be
obliged to submit works only on demand of the Pr&uuml;f (AIENG, 141). The
extent of such pre-publication prohibitions is unclear from surviving
records, but the Pr&uuml;fstelle managed to produce only four lists of
"unerw&uuml;nschter musikalischer Werke" ("undesirable musical works"),
remarkable in their brevity and encompassing only 150 compositions and
composers in all. The lists were eclectic, ranging from Irving Berlin
to Egon Wellesz, but with a heavy concentration of American popular music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In retrospect, it seems as if closer regulation of music licensed for
performance by the finite number of German and Austrian music publishers
would have been less cumbersome than monitoring myriad individual
performances throughout the country. However, competing jurisdictions and
power struggles within the Third Reich over responsibility for censorship
and the conduct of business, the potential ramifications of restrictions
on music publishing for international trade and foreign currency reserves,
and the desire to maintain an image of "business as usual" in the "land of
music" shielded the music publishing industry from the harshest scrutiny.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Nevertheless, as in so many other sectors of German society, even
 minimal threats of coercion

<B></B>

by the state had the notable effect of creating an environment of anxiety
in which self-censorship by publishers became the norm. Ultimately
the purge of Jewish composers and publishers radically and permanently
altered the geographical center of gravity within the industry, with
many key res emigrating to England and the United States.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because music publishing had such a low profile within regulatory
agencies, surviving official government documentation of that particular
Fachverband is sparse. Understandably as reluctant as Philip Morris
or Microsoft to open their internal business archives to scholarly
scrutiny because of continuing financial, legal, and contractual
implications, publishing houses have been particularly sensitive about
their history during the twelve-year period of National Socialism. The
largely unreliable self-commissioned "official histories" of individual
publishing companies have tended to treat this period as a brief
aberration of little consequence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 With professional sensitivities compounded by personal ones, family-owned
 firms, of course, have been particularly guarded in this regard.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Consequently, historians must piece together a fragmentary and
 provisional picture from widely scattered documents extant in other
 repositories, principally correspondence between the publishers and
 their composers.

Two such letters comprise vivid and nearly contemporary post-War snapshots
of Schott and UE. These letters also document diametric relationships
after 1933 between two leading composers of the Weimar era and their
respective publishers. As portals into the period from very different
yet complementary perspectives, the documents warrant close reading and
beg a wide array of questions about the institution of music publishing
under the Nazis. (The letters appear in facsimile in res <A HREF="8.1kowalke_2.html">2</A> and <A HREF="8.1kowalke_3.html">3</A>;

Remembering their first meeting during the summer of 1946, Hans Werner
Henze described Willy Strecker as "a witty and affable individual then
in his sixty-third year. . . . A native of Mainz, he had an Argentinian
passport and a house in Wiesbaden, which . . . contained some of the
finest Picassos, Klees, and Braques."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Hindemith had come to Schott more than a quarter century earlier than
 Henze, at almost the same time that Willy Strecker and his older
 brother Ludwig became partners in their father's company, as the
 First World War gave precarious birth to the Weimar Republic. While
 Hindemith's reputation and portfolio grew and Willy Strecker assumed more
 responsibilities within the firm, their professional relationship evolved
 onto a first-name and <I>Du</I>-basis. Schott's strategic stewardship of
 Hindemith's career on a global scale helped him to weather the turbulence
 of "Der Fall Hindemith" in 1934, subsequently to remain viable within
 Germany's musical life (even securing a commission from the Luftwaffe),
 and simultaneously to explore options outside Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 When those efforts finally failed and Hindemith took up residence in
 Switzerland and then the United States, he maintained direct personal
 contact with Schott, except during the years of total war. Continued
 promotion and publication of Hindemith's works abroad by a network of
 partially or wholly owned foreign affiliates minimized the impact of the
 1936 Nazi ban on performance of his works, furnished a firm foundation
 for his move to the United States, and assured his preeminence in
 immediate postwar German musical culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Willy Strecker's son Hugo oversaw from the London office an
orderly transfer of rights, Schott's affiliate in New York, Associated
Music Publishers (AMP), secured conducting and performing engagements
for Hindemith, served as an operational base for his American tours,
and provided ongoing support services during his residency in New Haven.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 "The Pub shop in New York," Hindemith wrote Willy Strecker "is a kind
 of substitute for the Weihergarten," the address of Schott's palatial
 headquarters in Mainz. Grateful for such constancy, Hindemith, in turn,
 volunteered that under the circumstances of 1941 his monthly stipend
 should be decreased to only what was necessary to sustain his mother
 and mother-in-law, who had remained behind in Germany. Hindemith wrote
 Strecker:

Having lost direct contact after December 1941, composer and publisher
managed only sporadic communications through intermediaries until August
1945. Emerson Kailey, an American bandsman, for example, visited Strecker
in Mainz in May 1945

<B></B>

and reported back to Hindemith that no manuscripts or plates of his
works had been lost and "they have been publishing everything that came
through from America. The <I>Ludus Tonalis</I> has sold 1,200 copies
in the three months it has been out in Germany." Kailey told Hindemith
that he didn't see Dr. Ludwig Strecker because the brothers "alternate in
going to Mainz. One goes one day and the other the next day. The reason
for that is that they have only one bicycle." The soldier concluded,
"Herr Strecker asked me to tell you that Germany needs you."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Strecker's own hand-carried note reported that "the old Weihergarten
 has come through it all more or less intact, [but] the printing works
 are completely destroyed." The relationship between the composer and
 his German publisher had also survived the war more or less intact. It
 remained symbiotic and monogamous; copyrights were systematically
 reassigned to Schott, and works composed in America were soon available
 for sale in Germany. All of Hindemith's music was (and continues to be)
 published exclusively by Schott.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Six weeks after Hindemith had received the encouraging letter from
Strecker of August 1946, Kurt Weill found in his rural mailbox near
New City, New York, a very different sort of letter from Alfred Schlee,

Schlee's letter is the first extant contact between composer and his
Austrian publisher since 1938. Prior to his flight from Berlin in March
1933, Weill had corresponded with UE on almost a daily basis, most
often with Hans Heinsheimer, the head of the stage department. Already
then, the exchange had frequently been plaintive or accusatory rather
than collaborative in tone, especially as the political environment
grew more hostile to performances of Weill's works and the composer's
frustrations with his publisher's efforts intensified. In June 1932,
Heinsheimer attempted to reassure Weill:

<B></B>

"Financial considerations . . . can play a role only to the extent
that we remain aware of the interaction between artistic and financial
concerns. . . . In the case of Kurt Weill, you can continue to be fully
and absolutely assured of our most generous and far-sighted publishing
policies."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 But Weill had hardly arrived in Paris when UE informed him in April 1933
 that, because the prevailing political situation discouraged performances
 of his stage works in Germany and there was little interest in them
 elsewhere, the firm would have to reduce his contractually mandated
 monthly stipend from 1,000 to 500 marks.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 In June UE proposed that the payments be discontinued temporarily or,
 alternatively, their contract be suspended, with rights in Weill's works
 returned to him for a year. When Weill rejected this proposal and UE
 ceased its monthly payments anyway, further acrimonious negotiations
 culminated in back-payment of five months' reduced stipend and mutual
 release from contractual obligations. UE stipulated, however, that it
 reserved the right to recoup the unearned balance in Weill's account
 from a small percentage of future earnings he might receive from
 another publisher.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Their contract would never be reinstated, and none of Weill's subsequent
 compositions would be published by UE.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The arrival of Schlee's letter after almost a decade of silence would
not have surprised Weill as much as its signatory would have. Because
UE's owners and virtually all of the senior staff had followed Weill into
emigration, he would have been unaware that the post-Anschluss leadership
vacuum at UE had been filled internally by Alfred Schlee, whom he would
have remembered only as a minor functionary within the firm. Schlee's

letters between Weill and UE written prior to Weill's emigration.

Prior to joining UE in 1927, Schlee, a native of Dresden, had studied
piano with Erwin Schulhoff and served as chorusmaster in Gera and
dramaturg in M&uuml;nster. Allied with the Wigman school of dance, he
accompanied Wigman's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Yvonne Georgi, and, as a
prolific critic, proselytized for the <I>Ausdruckstanz</I> (expressive
dance) in general and the theories of Rudolf von Laban in particular.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Laban's innovations in the notation of dance are better known today than
 his controversial theories of choral dancing, which became the core of
 what was later understood to be a National Socialist aesthetic. Although
 Laban allied himself closely with the National Socialists, he fell out of
 favor in 1938 and emigrated to England. (In dance he is a prime example
 of the fallacy in assuming that "progressive" aesthetics naturally ally
 themselves with "leftist" politics).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In his first contribution to <I>Modern Music</I> in 1931, Schlee
 asserted that art must foster an ethics that would support a strong
 national aesthetic identity: "The German does not consider art as a
 luxury but as an all-important element of his life and culture. And
 he is serious about the responsibility which this conception of art
 entails. It distinguishes him from almost every other race. . . . For
 this reason also the ethical content and not the appeal to the senses
 most concerns the German."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Having proposed to UE the founding of a dance periodical, Schlee had
freelanced in 1926 as Paul Stefan's uncredited assistant for <I>Tanz in
dieser Zeit</I>, a special issue of UE's journal, <I>Musikbl&auml;tter
des Anbruch</I>. The following year he officially joined UE's
Propaganda-Abteilung, to assist in the founding of a new quarterly
journal, <I>Schrifttanz</I>,

<B></B>

to be edited by Laban. However, Schlee soon took over sole editorship of
the journal and remained in that capacity until its demise in 1931. That
year he accompanied the tenor Otto Pasetti (who would later sing opposite
Lotte Lenya in the Vienna production of <I>Mahagonny</I> in April 1932)
in a recording on the Paloma label of Weill's "Muschel von Margate."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 In autumn 1931, UE dispatched Schlee to Berlin, where his two-room
 apartment on Bonner Stra&szlig;e doubled as UE's "Berlin office." Prior
 to 1933, the responsibilities of the "bright-eyed, bushy-tailed Schlee,"
 as Heinsheimer derisively characterized him to Weill, had not extended
 much beyond delivering and retrieving scores and parts from copyists,
 theaters, and composers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Schlee's contributions to <I>Modern Music</I> after January 1933, in
contrast to Heinsheimer's courageously outspoken reports, are guarded if
not timid. In 1934, Schlee reported, "The year has been marked by all
the phenomena traditionally associated with periods of great change,
the principal effect having been to restrict the production of new
works and works in new styles. Although <I>Gleichschaltung</I> has been
consummated, different interpretations of it prevail everywhere. A unified
artistic policy cannot yet be guaranteed; it is apparent only in its broad
outlines. . . . The great success [of <I>Arabella</I>]--though the text
is derived from the non-Aryan Hofmannsthal--is chiefly due to the general
worship of the great German personality, Richard Strauss. . . . This last
season has been one of change; the next will determine the fate of opera"
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Schlee remained in Berlin until mid-1938, when he returned to Vienna
as one of the very few employees permitted to continue working in the
"nazified" UE. The only hint in the surviving correspondence concerning
an event which might have left the composer "with a very bad impression"
of Schlee is Weill's response to Heinsheimer's report of 28 January 1933:
"Schlee told us very proudly that you couldn't work even with Rene Claire,
because he, too, had capitulated to the film industry." Weill replied on 6
February: "Mr. Schlee's strange remarks are quite misleading." Considering
the enormity of events during the intervening thirteen years, this minor
irritation would seem an unlikely cause for Schlee's post-war concern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Schlee's letter infuriated Weill. Although there is no reply extant in
the UE archives, Weill characterized the circumstances to Georg Kaiser's
widow as an "unbelievable breach of a publisher's responsibility to
its authors." "Unfortunately from here it's very difficult for me
to determine with much clarity the overall publishing situation," he
explained in response to her inquiry about performance possibilities
for the Weill-Kaiser works. "I had a letter from Universal Edition with
the casual notification that all my full scores had been confiscated by
the Gestapo. . . . I don't have a single full score of my European works
and therefore right now I can't say if one can procure them anywhere."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 (According to the terms of its standard agreement with composers,
 holograph scores of works printed by UE became the property of the
 publisher). Weill died without knowing that all but one had, in fact,
 survived. When in the mid-1950s, they emerged quietly and mysteriously,
 not from Gestapo warehouses, but from UE's own wartime caches, Weill's
 widow Lotte Lenya refused to re-assign to UE the twenty-eight-year
 renewal term of U.S. copyright. She placed with Schott several
 unpublished works, including <I>Die sieben Tods&uuml;nden</I>, which
 UE had declined in 1933.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shortly before Weill's death, Schlee demanded that Weill now repay the
outstanding pre-War balance on his account (14,607.05 Austrian schillings)
out of the earnings from <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I> or from what Schlee
assumed Weill must have been earning from his Broadway success.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Weill expressed some doubt after the war about UE's right to represent
 any of his works, but neither he nor Lenya followed through with such a
 claim. Eventually UE deducted the balance of the unrecouped advance from
 payments due Weill's estate. As late as 1954, when <I>The Threepenny
 Opera</I> began its recordbreaking run at the Theater de Lys in New
 York, UE's share of royalties (5%) was still impounded by the Custodian
 of Alien Property. UE subsequently allowed many of Weill's works to go
 out of print and published only two full scores of his stage works in
 the fifty years following his death. Today, therefore, Weill's oeuvre
 remains fragmented, individual copyrights literally splintered, with
 half a dozen publishers picking up pieces in different domains.

Why were the experiences of Schott and UE and their two respective
composers so different? On the surface, the firms seem similar: both
were small, family-owned businesses, the former headquartered in the
heart of Rheinhessen in Mainz, the latter located symbolically within the
opulent and tradition-soaked Musikverein on the Karlsplatz in Vienna. The
National Socialists so closely identified both of them with decadent
developments in music that their house journals, Schott's <I>Melos</I>,
which was renamed and retooled in 1934, and UE's <I>Anbruch</I>, which
ceased publication in 1937, shared a panel at the 1938 "Entartete Musik"
in D&uuml;sseldorf, captioned: "In these pages was Cultural Bolshevism
nurtured!" (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_4.html"> 4</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Despite the inclusion of Hindemith and Stravinsky, UE and its composers
 held pride of place at that exhibition. After Stravinsky had vociferously
 protested his inclusion as "absolutely inadmissible," he received (and
 relayed to Strecker) assurances of "benevolent neutrality" henceforth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 An upstart

<B></B>

founded in 1901 and specializing in new music, UE was considered by
the National Socialist officials to be <I>the</I> Jewish publishing
house. Founded and still owned by Jews at the time of the Anschluss,
managed largely by Jews, with a catalogue populated by a Jewish majority
and a radical leftist minority, UE was also the principal agent in the
West for the Soviet State Publishing House. Any nationalist halo emanating
from its original Bruckner and Strauss holdings had long since dissipated.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With a history almost parallel to that of German music itself, Schott,
on the other hand, was still regarded in the 1930s as the venerable
publisher of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and Wagner's <I>Ring des
Nibelungen</I>. Its owners, Ludwig Strecker, Sr., and two of his sons,
Wilhelm and Ludwig, Jr., were Aryan. Each of them had dutifully submitted
a completed questionnaire to that effect to the Reichsmusikkammer,
Fachverband Musikalien-Verleger (Assembly of Music Publishers).
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Tracing their Aryan lineage back through the requisite two generations
 on both mother's and father's sides, they confirmed that the "Konfession"
 of their forebears in every case had been "evangelisch," i.e., religion:
 Protestant. All three Streckers also certified that they had never
 belonged to the Communist Party or any other subversive political
 entities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Willy left unanswered the question concerning former and
present party affiliations, Ludwig Jr. listed his as <I>Deutschnationale
Volkspartei</I>. However, by the mid-thirties it was widely rumored in
Mainz that Ludwig Jr., a doctor of law and tournament tennis player, was
"a Nazi"--if not an actual member, then a strong supporter of the party.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 But Robert Craft's published report of Samuel Dushkin's assertion that
 "Ludwig was a Nazi party member" cannot be verified from existing
 records; among the applications for party membership or the membership
 rolls themselves there is no listing for Ludwig Strecker, Jr. or any
 of his known pen-names.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Hermann Reutter, a composer published exclusively by Schott, recalled
 in 1980 that he had joined the Nazi party in 1933 at the prompting of
 Ludwig Strecker.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 That same year, under the pseudonym of Ludwig Andersen, Strecker supplied
 the text for Reutter's cantata <I>Der gro&szlig;e Kalender</I> ,
 which was performed at the opening of the Reichsmusikkammer in 1933 and
 then hailed by Hans Hinkel as "<I>the</I> oratorio of the Third Reich."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Strecker also wrote the librettos for some of the Reich's most
 successful nationalist operas (many of which were published by Schott),
 including Werner Egk's <I>Die Zaubergeige</I>  which received 198
 performances prior to 1945, and Reutter's <I>Doktor Johannes Faust</I>
 , which received 116 performances.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Besides the questionnaire, the only document preserved in Ludwig
 Strecker's Reichsmusikkammer file is a letter of 27 October 1942,
 requesting a fifteen-minute appointment from then Ministerialdirektor
 Hans Hinkel. It ends with the nearly obligatory "Heil Hitler!" Hitler
 himself had sent official congratulations to Ludwig, Sr., on the occasion
 of his diamond wedding anniversary earlier in the year.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With few exceptions (most prominently Ernst Toch and Erich Korngold),
at the time of Hitler's ascent to power the vast majority of Schott's
composers were also "Aryan," and largely untainted by radical politics
of the left. During the next decade, the Streckers took into the Schott
catalogue the most performed composers of the period, including Egk,
Reutter, Ernst Pepping, and Wolfgang Fortner, as well as more

<B></B>

than a few politically correct but musically insipid composers such as
Hans Gansser. With Carl Orff headlining a roster left largely intact
after the purge of non-Aryan composers (and eventually also Hindemith
and Stravinsky), Schott could now claim undisputed first place in
the publication of new music in Germany. In 1940 the firm boasted
that seven contemporary operas it had published were in permanent
repertory, including several with librettos by Ludwig Andersen
(<I>MiTR</I>, 163). The firm enjoyed similar success in the domain
of orchestral music. During this time Schott also discreetly deleted
from its catalogue compositions that were likely to be most offensive
to the new regime. Orff's cantatas with texts by Werfel and Brecht,
and Hindemith's early one-act operas, including <I>Nusch-Nuschi</I>
and <I>Sancta Susanna</I>, were "taken off the market" and placed in
what Strecker called "the poison cupboard."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Prior to the ban on performance of Hindemith's music, Strecker tried to
 convince cultural administrators that the composer had never written
 "cheap successes" as Weill and Krenek had, Hindemith did not
 owe his success to "Jewish cliques and critics," and his "positive,
 constructive music" should not be compared with "the decadent
 intellectual musical efforts of a Schoenberg."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 Without any attempt to disguise the family's and firm's anti-Semitism,
 Strecker persuaded both Stravinsky and Hindemith to take the precaution
 of certifying their racial purity and ideological indifference well in
 advance of any necessity to do so.

If Breitkopf &amp; H&auml;rtel had led the march into the field of
Nazi propaganda music, Schott was not too far behind. Already in 1931,
Schott had published a collection of "hearth and home" songs under the
title <I>Deutsche Heimat</I> (<I>German Homeland</I>) edited by Ludwig
Andersen. It was reprinted several times during the next decade and
often took pride of place in Schott's advertisements.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Soon after Hitler became chancellor in 1933, Schott published
 the <I>Badonviller Marsch</I>, Hitler's "official entrance music"
 (roughly the equivalent of "Hail to the Chief" for the President of
 the United States). The following year Hermann Blume's "Adolf Hitler
 Fanfare" appeared in the same series of <I>M&auml;rsche f&uuml;r
 Blasorchester</I>. Schott also printed in 1934 <I>Neues Deutschland</I>
 (or: <I>New Germany</I>), a songbook intended for use by the SA, and
 <I>Junges Deutschland</I> (or: <I>Young Germany</I>), a set of newly
 composed songs by Armin Knab extolling the achievements of National
 Socialism (<I>MiTR</I>,152).
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 In the early 1940s Schott issued <I>Das neue Soldaten Liederbuch</I>,
 edited by Fr. J. Breuer, in three volumes, with color-coded covers
 adorned by the same picture of two young German soldier-singers in full
 uniform (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_5.html"> 5</A>). "The best-known and best-loved songs of our armed
 forces," Schott advertised. Many of the songs in the collection had
 been previously published by other firms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Hans Gansser's <I>K&auml;mpfen hei&szlig;t leben: Weihe-, Kampf- und
 Sturmlieder der Zeit f&uuml;r Gemeinsamkeits- und Einzelvortrag</I>
 (or: <I>To Struggle is To Live: Contemporary Songs of Dedication,
 ting, and Attacking for Group or Individual Delivery</I>)
 comprised fourteen songs for voice and piano; its frontispiece
 carried an explicit dedication to Adolf Hitler. Published in 1944,
 it contained songs entitled "Gel&ouml;bnis an den F&uuml;hrer"
 ("Praise to the F&uuml;hrer") and "Ein F&uuml;hrer, Volk und Reich"
 ("One F&uuml;hrer, People, and Reich") (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_6.html"> 6</A>). An advertisement on
 the back cover for other compositions by Gansser published by Schott
 included "Der Frontsoldat" ("The Sodier at the

<B></B>

Front") and "Kampfesmut und Treue" ("Courage for Combat and Sadness") for
unison mass chorus, "Heldische Trauermusik" ("Heroic Music of Sadness")
and an arrangement of the Marschlied der SS von Kurt Eggers, "Kamerad,
die Schicksalsstunde schl&auml;gt" ("Comrade, the Hour of Destiny Calls").

Such displays of loyalty to the cause apparently afforded Schott
considerable latitude in the conduct of its daily operations,
in addition to an uninterrupted cash flow. Even after the ban on
performances of Hindemith in 1936, Schott continued to publish
his works, including the second part of <I>Unterweisung um
Tonsatz</I> in 1939, which Willy Strecker didn't bother to pass by
the Reichsmusikpr&uuml;fstelle. Hindemith expressed his surprise and
gratitude: "I had many doubts that it would prove possible, so I'm now all
the more delighted. . . . I have the feeling that, for you personally,
this little work was not just a routine publishing item, it is as if an
unusual amount of goodwill and good wishes on the part of the publishers
were printed alongside it (perhaps in this connection with the evil
signs attending its birth), and for this I give you special thanks."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 "It was a sport," Strecker later told the composer, "for me to bring
 out all these things [including the violin and cello concertos, Symphony
 in E-flat, <I>The Four Temperaments</I>]

<B></B>

despite the Nazi ban, and fortunately we weren't caught."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 The Streckers' considerable diplomatic and tactical skills also kept
 Stravinsky viable in Germany through 1939, even managing to export
 his royalties despite the general embargo against doing so. But the
 Streckers were not always successful in working both sides of the
 street. Schott's new edition of Riemann's <I>Musik-Lexikon</I>,
 replacing Alfred Einstein's eleventh edition of 1929, was halted
 in February 1939 after the letter "D" and 128 pages because, as one
 critic objected, although "the Reich of Adolf Hitler has carried out
 the ultimate separation between what is non-Jewish and what is Jewish
 in the area of cultural, intellectual, and scholarly life, . . . all
 the Jewry that had embedded itself in our culture in the last decades
 is still being honored with extensive tributes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Meanwhile, the situation at UE was far more complicated. After Emil
Hertzka's death in 1932, ownership of UE vested in Hertzka's widow
Yella, as well as his nephew Alfred Kalmus and niece Marianne Teich,
all of whom were Jewish. Under dire circumstances, Hugo Winter assumed
the position of Gesch&auml;ftsf&uuml;hrer (Executive Director) within a
managing triumvirate that included Kalmus and Hans Heinsheimer. Crusades
by the Kampfbund fuer deutscher Kultur had already all but wiped UE works

<B></B>

from the major stages in Germany, the firm was still reeling from effects
of the worldwide depression, and it was precipitously overextended in
its composer obligations for a relatively youthful catalogue, which
had already surpassed ten thousand titles. The large number of Soviet
publications which UE had acquired in the late 1920s at the initiative
of Kalmus, who was fluent in Russian, would also soon become a liability.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nearly bankrupt, UE was particularly ill-equipped to weather the
impending crisis, as it had assembled only the most haphazard array of
foreign representatives and subpublishers. When Alban Berg reported to
Schoenberg in October 1933 that UE had suspended payment of his monthly
stipend of 1,000 schillings, Schoenberg replied from Paris: "What you tell
me about UE is very unfortunate. I'd like to make a suggestion to you:
perhaps UE would be prepared to join forces with a second publisher. I
imagine one could find a wealthy publishing house willing to advance
the necessary funds if UE gave them a share of the profits!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Although eventually UE reinstated to Berg a monthly stipend of 500
 shillings, he suggested to Schoenberg and Franz Schreker that they
 consider forming an association of UE composers in order to protect their
 interests. Schreker had also complained to Schoenberg that an engaged and
 indolent UE was doing "nothing more than allowing things to take their
 course and is quite possibly in league with the prevailing current."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Schreker confronted Heinsheimer directly: "Isn't it about time for the
 publisher to undertake some initiative for my works? Especially now,
 at least <I>abroad</I>, despite the fact that I'm not under any kind
 of boycott here."

Alfred Kalmus did indeed travel to Paris, London, and New York
(where he was disappointed to find that the 1933 Broadway production
of <I>Threepenny Opera</I> was a dud), but his efforts yielded very
few immediate tangible results. In August 1935, Berg reported on UE's
continuing misfortunes: "several weeks ago director Winter's wife and
[Erwin] Stein's father both died on the same day. (Shortly before that,
Heinsheimer's father and uncle). And poor Stein has been seriously ill
for a terribly long time now."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Responding to the recent trends in German theaters, UE opened a new
 operetta division (Wiener Operetten Verlag) to address the burgeoning
 demand for such entertainments. In January 1935, Heinsheimer informed
 Weill, who was then living in Paris: "We have now expanded our stage
 activity and have branched out from the narrow confines of opera. We're
 already preparing several plays-with-music, and one of them has
 been placed in the Theater in der Josefstadt here, in London, and in
 Prague. . . . I would be very pleased if we could also do business
 together again."

UE continued to publish and promote new works by the dwindling group
of composers in its catalog still performable, including Berg's
<I>Symphonische St&uuml;cke aus "Lulu"</I> and violin concerto,
Kod&aacute;ly's <I>T&auml;nze aus Galanta</I> and <I>Te Deum</I>,
Bart&oacute;k's fifth string quartet, Webern's op. 27 Variations for
Piano, as well as works by Alfredo Casella, Othmar Schoeck, Franz
Schmidt, and a number of minor Austrian composers. Building on the
precedent of Weill's <I>Die B&uuml;rgschaft</I>, Wagner-R&eacute;geny
and Caspar Neher picked up some of the slack in the opera department,
with <I>Der G&uuml;nstling</I> (<I>The Favorite</I>) premiering in Dresden
in 1935. But soon, one by one, UE's leaders fled the firm. Alfred Kalmus
relocated to London in 1936 and opened a branch of UE there, but he failed
to transfer or fully safeguard copyrights, manuscripts, and stock. During
the war Universal Edition London operated under the aegis of Boosey &amp;
Hawkes, which had also offered employment to UE's house editor, Erwin
Stein, and its head of publications, Ernst Roth. Arriving in New York the
day before Hitler marched into Vienna, Heinsheimer decided not to return;
he joined the American branch of Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Hugo Winter hung
on at UE until 1939, when he moved to New York as vice-president of
Associated Music Publishers. UE therefore lost its entire management
team to other firms in London or New York.

Although AMP was nominally as much UE's American representative as it
was Schott's, it seems barely to have functioned as such. Because UE
had suspended its contracts with many of its "entartete" composers,
who then signed on with other publishing companies, it could not merely
transfer its publishing obligations and operations to London or New York,
as Schott had done in the cases of Stravinsky and Hindemith. In July 1937,
Weill, in New York for almost two years but still apparently unaware of
AMP's existence, felt it necessary to write directly to Kalmus in Vienna
(apparently unaware that he had already departed for London): "After such
a long time, my main reason for writing is to ask you to send me as soon
as possible several copies of all my works that appeared with Universal
Edition. . . . I am starting to get requests from different quarters

The substance of so colorful a tale might be dismissed with its fanciful
embellishments were it not corroborated, in part, by more reliable
sources. William Shirer confirms that the deposed Chancellor of Austria
Kurt von Schuschnigg was indeed incarcerated by the Gestapo on the fifth
floor of the Hotel Metropole in Vienna for seventeen months, beginning
28 May 1938:

Dr. Schuschnigg had been arrested and subjected to treatment so degrading
 that it is difficult to believe that it was not prescribed by Hitler
 himself. Kept under house arrest from March 12 until May 28, during
 which time the Gestapo contrived to prevent him from getting any sleep
 by the most petty devices, he was then taken to Gestapo headquarters
 at the Hotel Metropole in Vienna, where he was incarcerated in a tiny
 room on the fifth floor for the next seventeen months. There, with the
 towel issued to him for his personal use, he was forced to clean the
 quarters, washbasins, slop buckets and latrines of the S.S. guards and
 perform other various menial tasks thought up by the Gestapo. By March
 1, the first anniversary of his fall, he had lost fifty-eight pounds,
 but the S.S. doctor reported that his condition was excellent.

Internal documents also confirm that UE was allowed, even encouraged,
to export degenerate music to enemy territories, thereby benefiting from
both the influx of foreign currency and the material's potential for
moral corruption abroad. A comprehensive directive dated 14 April 1939
(<A HREF="8.1kowalke_7.html"> 7</A>) declares that works by Jewish composers that could no longer
be sold in Germany and Austria could still be exported. Editions by
Jews of classical works, exemplified by Heinrich Schenker's volume
of Beethoven sonatas, are exempt from the domestic ban for the time
being. Anthologies must be cleansed of Jewish contributions by the new
year, while the manner in which historical res such as Mendelssohn
are to be handled remains unresolved for the time being. Doubtful cases
are to be referred to Mr. Deczey (whom Schlee also mentioned in his
1946 letter to Weill). Deczey would then check the "J&uuml;den-Alphabet"
("Alphabetical Listing of Jews") and pass on still unresolved cases to
Herr Schenk, who had signed the directive.

The "J&uuml;den-Alphabet" seems to have been supplemented eventually by
an annotated list of all of UE's publications, ordered by plate number
and assembled from

<B></B>

several printed "Nummernverzeichnis" and handwritten addenda, including
one for the Wiener Operetten Verlag. The lists were color-coded,
with red lines drawn through items which could no longer be sold
domestically and blue lines through editions of Aryan composers
by Jews and other questionable titles. The list of "red composers"
extended from Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Thalberg, and Offenbach to all
Jewish contemporary composers and many Russian composers. The remaining
"white" group included Webern, Berg, Stravinsky, Krenek, Casella,
Szymanowski, Tiessen, Malipiero, Benatzky, Zemlinsky, Bart&oacute;k,
Kod&aacute;ly, Jan&aacute;cek, Satie, and Johann Strau&szlig;
(whose Jewish heritage had by then been officially suppressed).
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 The three categorizations are sometimes self-contradictory and
 misinformed: for example, Roy Harris is "red," but Aaron Copland is
 "white"; Bie's editions of Mozart, Friedman's of Liszt, and Mahler's
 version of Weber's <I>Oberon</I> are "red," but Heinrich Schenker's
 edition of Beethoven, Pisk's and Geiringer's of Haydn are "blue"
 (res <A HREF="8.1kowalke_8.html">8</A> and <A HREF="8.1kowalke_9.html">9</A> present two pages from this catalogue).

When Arnold Schoenberg, who would soon be one of UE's "red" composers,
heard of the "Rally of Liberation" in Vienna on 15 March 1938, with
a quarter million Austrians cheering Hitler's entry into the city, he
wrote a bitterly satirical text for Leh&aacute;r's "Wien, Wien nur Du
allein." And less than a month later, B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k wrote to
a friend: "not only my publisher (UE) has gone Nazi (the proprietors and
directors were simply turned out) but also the <I>AKM</I> (the Viennese
performing rights society), to which I belong (and Kod&aacute;ly, too),
is also being 'nazified'. . . . As far as UE is concerned, we have just

<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Bart&oacute;k continued: "The day before yesterday I received the
 notorious questionnaire about grandfathers, etc., then: 'Are you of
 German blood, of kindred race, or non-Aryan?' Naturally neither I nor
 Kod&aacute;ly will fill in the form. . . . Another question runs like
 this: 'Where and when were you wounded?' Answer: 'On the 11th, 12th,
 and 13th of March, 1938, in Vienna!" A letter to Dorothy Parrish of
 February 1939 reports: "These Germans cling to me like ticks. What
 efforts, what a lot of scribbling it required to become a member of the
 English Performing Rights Society. In this I succeeded at long last,

Officials first placed UE under the supervision of the brothers Robert
and Ernst Geutebr&uuml;ck and impounded assets of the company. Then
Schott was chosen to take over ownership of its archrival. But soon both
Goebbels and G&ouml;ring were displeased with Schott's "unreliable"
stewardship. Goebbels's diary entries in mid-December 1940 make brief
reference to the matter: "We are absolutely right about the Schott
affair. This firm has no right to put on airs as if it's been Aryanized"
(14 December 1940). The following day, he wrote, "The question of
Schott-Universal Edition occupies me far too much. But I want to finally
clarify matters" (15 December 1940).
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 He apparently intervened directly, and a chastened Schott was forced
 to sell UE to Peters, another once-Jewish firm which had already been
 Aryanized in 1939 under the former head of Schott's own periodical
 division, Johannes Petschull. The firm thereafter was known as
 Petschull-Universal Edition. After the war, Willy Strecker confirmed
 to Hindemith's soldier-messenger that he had indeed "bought Universal
 Edition but was forced to resell it to a friend of G&ouml;ring's under
 threat of expulsion from the council of publishers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>

Very little is known about the activities of Petschull-Universal Edition
during the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 Official histories of UE present variations on a theme: "After
 the annexation of Austria by Hitler, the structure and leadership
 of the publishing house underwent important changes. Despite the
 changed circumstances, several department heads worked tirelessly in
 collaboration with Betty Rothe and Alfred Schlee to stay as close as
 possible to the course UE had previously followed, in order to lead the
 firm through the ensuing war years without making too many concessions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Schlee had remained in Berlin until spring or summer 1938. (Fifty years
 later, he recalled that his earlier suggestion to Kalmus and Winter
 that UE establish a satellite firm in Switzerland had been rejected as
 too alarmist and pessimistic at the time.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 After the Anschluss Schlee returned to Vienna with his Jewish wife,
 photographer Anni Taussig, who committed suicide the following year.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 Schlee, whose name did not appear in the April 1939 directive, recalled
 that UE was fortunate to have decent individuals as commissarial
 administrators, who even made possible the emigration of Hugo Winter in
 1939. Prior to the war, "export to foreign countries still functioned,"
 Schlee observed, "as the Nazis' need for foreign currency exceeded
 their concern over promulgating the same kind of cultural goods they
 had been ting against."
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 Publishing continued on a greatly reduced scale, with Bohuslav Martinu
 entering the catalogue in 1939; Frank Martin, Eugen Suchon, Willy
 Burkhard, and Karl Schiske in 1940; Theodor Berger

<B></B>

and Alfred Uhl in 1941; Gottfried von Einem in 1943. Among the important
works that appeared after March 1938 were Webern's <I>Das Augenlicht</I>
and the op. 24 Concerto , Frank Schmidt's <I>Buch mit 7 Siegeln</I>
, Martinu's Concerto grosso , Bart&oacute;k's Piano Concerto
#2 , and Martin's <I>In Terra Pax</I> . UE seems to have been
spared coercion to publish the type of obsequiously patriotic material
that its German counterparts were producing at the time. UE continued its
series of regional folk-song collections, including <I>Volkslieder und
Jodler um den Schneeberg und Semmering in Niederdonau</I> (<I>Folksongs
and Yodels from the Area of Schneeber and Semmering in Lower Donau</I>)
. It also published works by such minor composers as Leo Justinus
Kauffmann, whose <I>Abendkantate</I> appeared under the imprint of
"Universal Edition Dr. Johannes Petschull."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Without access to internal correspondence files, it is impossible to
determine the degree of autonomy from Petschull and Peters that UE
actually enjoyed. Schlee said nothing about his own day-to-day function
within the firm, except to claim that his "immediate concern was not
dedicated to the present, but to the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
 He emphasized, however, that he had employed his friend Anton von
 Webern to arrange, proofread, make piano-vocal scores, and appraise
 submissions. Webern accompanied Schlee to Switzerland in 1943, despite
 stringent passport regulations, to hear Hermann Scherchen conduct
 the premiere of the op. 30 Variations for Orchestra, for which UE
 had furnished the newly copied orchestra parts. Dallapiccola gives an
 eyewitness account of an evening in March 1942 at Schlee's apartment,
 with the "usually subdued" Webern turning red in the face and exploding
 at the mention of Kurt Weill's name: "What trace can <I>you</I> find
 in such a composer of our great Central European tradition?"--an
 almost verbatim recitation of the indictments of Weill in official
 Nazi publications.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Schlee's only published firsthand account of this period, barely a page
long, he recalled that "even in Nazi circles there existed something akin
to an Austrian patriotism," which allowed the musical treasures of UE to
be "semi-officially transported out of town and hidden mostly in churches"
as a precaution against destruction by Allied bombing--with Gauleiter
Baldur von Schirach looking the other way. Schlee said that in one rural
church the "works of Weill and Schoenberg were stored behind the organ,"
and that other "precious materials" were stored in the Ransau region,
others in a monastery near Zwettl and in his own family's summer house
near Semmering. The husband of Susan Kalmus, Stephan Harpner, who became
a director of UE after the war, remembers that some materials had also
been hidden in the bakery of Erwin Ratz.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 Inconsistencies in chronology, personnel, and geography within
 UE's corporate memory are probably suggestive of the improvised
 and clandestine nature of these various attempts to preserve UE's
 valuables. Apparently no inventory lists were made or kept, because even
 years later UE was unsure of what had been preserved. In February 1952,
 for example, UE responded to a cabled request from AMP for a copy of the
 full score of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I>: "We suppose it has been lost
 during the war." A day later, however, the head of UE's stage department
 wrote, without any apparent sense of irony: "We are able to send it to
 you. This full score is Kurt Weill's handwritten



copy and very precious. We therefore ask you kindly to take care of it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 <I>Mahagonny</I>, which, Schlee said, had been carried off by the
 Gestapo, did not turn up for several more years.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Gestapo," Schlee recollected in 1988, "came to UE only once and
confiscated strangely enough, only Weill and Schenker." (So peculiar a
pairing are Weill and Schenker that subsequent retellings of this tale
have treated Schenker as a typographical error and invariably transformed
Schenker into Schreker.) UE's internal records are informative on this
point, actually documenting <I>two</I> visits by the Gestapo, on 9 April
and 26 April 1940. According to entries in the archive books of the
production department, during its first visit the Gestapo confiscated
approximately 33,000 copies of forty-five different publications of
songs, choral music, piano-vocal scores and librettos of operas. With one
exception (862 copies of the <I>Arbeiterlieder</I> by Anatol Rathaus),
they were all compositions by Eisler (totalling 24,064 copies) and Weill
(8,305 copies). Most of the items boasted texts by Bertolt Brecht.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 On its second visit, on 26 April, the Gestapo took away much less
 material: approximately 160 copies each of three songs from Bela
 Reinitz's 1930 Singspiel <I>Schatten &uuml;ber Haarlem</I>, plus 226
 copies of two other songs by Reinitz; and some 800 copies of writings by
 the hypernationalist Heinrich Schenker, including <I>Harmonielehre</I>
 II/1 , II/2 , <I>Der freie Satz</I>, Textband , Notenband
 .
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>
 In the <I>Lexikon der Juden in der Musik</I>, Schenker is, in fact,
 denounced as "the principal representative of an abstract music
 theory favoring that kind of Jewish philosophy which disavows any
 inner psychological content and instead confines itself to detecting
 arbitrarily and out of context an 'Urlinie'."
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
 Asserting that Schenker's basic ideas had been widely disseminated,
 the entry proves the point of Kurt Tucholsky's <I>bon mot</I>, "The
 Nazis weren't interested in an artist's body of work, only his foreskin."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Records for rented performance materials in UE's hire library indicate
that only those for Weill's <I>B&uuml;rgschaft</I> (<I>Security</I>)and
two versions of <I>Mahagonny</I> and Reinitz's <I>Schatten &uuml;ber
Haarlem</I> were confiscated, and no date is specified. A list of
printing plates that were either sent to Peters in Leipzig or consigned
to the Reichstelle f&uuml;r Metalle to be recycled for the war effort
is much longer. Because this list of 100 items contains no "entartete"
composers and several revered ones (including Bach, Beethoven, and Verdi),
this selection appears to be a combination of expendable titles with
negligible future potential and classic works that were to be taken over
by Peters. There is no extant record of confiscation of any holograph
scores. Given the highly selective nature of the list of materials that
were confiscated, it is intriguing to speculate whether the Gestapo had
entered UE with a carefully considered shopping list of symbolic works
or if the secret police were advised by Petschull-UE employees, with only
the currently most unperformable or unsalable works conveniently laid out
for their consideration. In either case, the event is worthy of a film
script: imagine a close-up of Schoenberg's holographs piled atop Weill's
(the only music in the world in which, Schoenberg had claimed, he could
find no quality whatsoever) as they both hid behind the monastery organ;
then crossfade to copies of the 1935 edition of <I>Der freie Satz</I>
by Schenker rubbing spines in the crates with Brecht, Weill, and Eisler
as they are carried off by the Gestapo.

Schlee's letter to Weill in 1946 can now be read in a more nuanced
context. The Gestapo had indeed confiscated <I>Mahagonny</I>--not
Weill's holograph score, but UE's printed materials, thus begging several
questions: at that time, where were the plates from which the music would
eventually be reprinted in the mid-1950s? And where, fifteen months after
war's end, was the holograph score? (Perhaps it was still waiting with
Schoenberg's <I>Erwartung</I> behind the organ?) Why were these treasures,
which allegedly had been Schlee's primary concern between 1938 and 1945,
now unretrieved? Most of Weill's holographs would eventually turn up
at UE in the mid 1950s, but only after repeated inquiries from Lenya
and would-be producers. If Schlee's account of the Gestapo's visit
seems incomplete and partially secondhand, he may have had more direct
knowledge about the loss of some other Weill materials. Still missing, for
example, is an item prominently displayed in facsimile at the "Entartete
Musik" exhibition in D&uuml;sseldorf, which opened ten weeks after the
<I>Anschluss</I>. The musical excerpt displayed in the poster (<A HREF="8.1kowalke_0.html"> 10</A>)
comprises the final three measures of Weill's holograph pre-rehearsal
score of the "Ballade vom angenehmen Leben," which he had sent UE in 1928
for the purpose of preparing rehearsal and performance materials. Only
someone with access to UE's archives could have made this contribution
to Weill's defamation. His identity remains a mystery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF80" HREF="#FOOT80">80</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An event which may have left Weill with what Schlee called "a very
bad impression" was the disappearance, in 1933, of a parcel containing
virtually all of Weill's unpublished early works, including, most likely,
the op. 5 <I>Divertimento</I>, the orchestral cycle

<B></B>

of Rilke's <I>Stundenbuch</I>, <I>Recordare</I>, <I>Zaubernacht</I>,
and the symphonic <I>Fantasia, Passacaglia, und Hymnus</I>. In 1932
Weill had lent these and other scores to musicologist Walter Fleischer,
who was working on a volume about the composer to follow one on
Stravinsky. Fleischer vividly recalled the circumstances: "I was in
Italy, and knowing nothing of Weill's whereabouts after March 1933, I
mailed the package of scores to the Berlin office of Universal Edition,
in care of Alfred Schlee. In December 1933, when I saw Weill again at a
performance of <I>Mahagonny</I> in Rome, I told him what I'd done with
his manuscripts. Although he expressed no surprise at the disappearance
of the package, at the mention of Schlee's name, Weill silently wagged
his right forefinger twice: left-right, left-right."

honored nor oppressed," but rather "treated with derision," Schlee
thanked the "alien nations that supported all those whom the brutal

Schlee's poetic portrayal of the martyred Webern seems to have been
calculated to discourage doubts about any unresolved discords still
reverberating from Schoenberg's anguished and unanswered question put
to his former student in June 1937: "Is it true that you have become a
supporter, or even a member of the Nazi Party?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF84" HREF="#FOOT84">84</a></SUP>
 (Although there is no evidence that Webern ever joined the party,
 virtually everyone in his immediate

family did, with his son Peter, who was killed in the war, and one
of his sons-in-law particularly rabid partisans. Until recently, most
biographers and critics have accepted the testimony of Webern's daughter,
Amalie Waller: "The occupation of Austria by Hitler was a terrific blow
for my father. Not only was his music banned and outlawed because it
belonged to the category of 'degenerate art,' but all doors and gates

By recounting the hardships which the "other-worldly" bystander Webern
had endured during and immediately after the war at the hands of both its
perpetrators and, inadvertently, its victors, his friend and publisher
Schlee was still looking "beyond the present" to "a time afterwards" and
laying the groundwork for the heroicization of the "anst&auml;ndiger
Mensch" ("decent man") Webern. But as the disturbing "trotzdem"
("nevertheless") of Webern's own case, his enthusiastic embrace of
Hitler and National Socialist ideology, has gradually and painfully been
revealed in subsequent decades, Schlee's messianic mythology has collapsed
into willful historical fiction. A more accurate, and necessarily less
sympathetic, portrait suggests a metaphor more apt than Schlee's biblical
one. Webern had indeed suffered, but as a tragic Greek hero, whose fatal
flaw was an inability or unwillingness to integrate or reconcile his
life and art. Absent evidence to corroborate the testimony of Webern's
daughter that the occupation of Austria by Hitler was a terrific blow
for her father or Robert Craft's claims that the Nazis banned his music,
burned his writings, and forbade him all activity, Webern's purported
persecution for his aesthetic allegiance to twelve-tone composition now
must also be doubted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF87" HREF="#FOOT87">87</a></SUP>
 The wartime neglect of his music can no longer believably be ascribed to
 official governmental proscription or censorship on racial, political,
 or aesthetic grounds.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although his music had been performed only rarely before the National
Socialists came to power, Webern's portrayal as a "suppressed" composer
of "subversive" music became a crucial component of post-war modernist
strategies to turn away from a corrupt recent past and claim for serialism
the highest moral ground, as the only alternative truly responsive to
the horrors of the recent past.
<SUP><a NAME="REF88" HREF="#FOOT88">88</a></SUP>
 However, with Webern as standard bearer, post-war serialists, asserted
 Hans Werner Henze, actually sought to restore music to "a state of
 purity as if nothing had happened; as if there were no class struggle, no
 imperialism, no wars, as if society were in order; as though everything
 were as untouched as blades of grass high in the Alps."
<SUP><a NAME="REF89" HREF="#FOOT89">89</a></SUP>
 "It was precisely its utopian (its 'scientific') aspect, as well as
 the myth of its political suppression," Richard Taruskin

<B></B>

has observed, "that facilitated serialism's seeming natural selection
as the neomodernist lingua franca from out of the ashes of the Second
World War."
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 Because the post-war construction of a new ethical framework for music
 after Auschwitz depended on the belief of the historical imperative
 and aesthetic superiority of serialism, the depoliticization of modern
 music required the depoliticization of Anton Webern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By detaching the discovery which was supposed to have assured the
supremacy of German music for a hundred years from its ideological origins
and socio-political ramifications, Schlee posited, already in 1946,
a key component in what would become the dominant historical narrative
of twentieth-century music. (Its prevalence and longevity is evinced
in so recent a survey as Arnold Whittall's <I>Musical Composition in
the Twentieth Century</I> [1999], which still glosses Webern's politics
and wartime conduct as merely "right-wing sympathies" and then dismisses
them as irrelevant because "the music's qualities transcend rather than
helplessly implement its ideological context.")
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 Thus, years before Pierre Boulez, one of UE's first post-war recruits,
 announced that "Schoenberg Is Dead" and admonished the musical world not
 "to forget that a certain Webern also labored," Schlee had anointed
 his friend as the only reliable guide into "the Promised Land," the
 rightful interpreter of "the sacred Tablets of Law."
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Alfred Kalmus decided to remain in London after the war, Schlee
took over operations in Vienna. From that strategic base, he quickly
claimed the role of chief architect of its high modernist edifice,
built substantially on the foundations of the already proliferating
martyrology of Webern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 Schlee recruited a youthful roster of composers rivaling Hertzka's, but
 with few of the eclectics, dissenters, and populists who had balanced the
 Second Viennese School within UE's catalogue during the interwar period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>
 With Boulez and Stockhausen quickly emerging as its principal spokesmen
 and, after 1955, the new UE-periodical <I>Die Reihe: Information
 &uuml;ber serielle Musik</I> serving as its propagandist mouthpiece,
 what Henze described as "official musical thinking" adopted Webern's
 procedures as its foundation, "whose maxims the body of lesser mortals
 now had to put into practice (allowing for seasonal variation) with
 religious devotion, esprit de corps and slavish obedience"(<I>BFAA</I>,
 43). Disillusioned by the confusion of moral and aesthetic criteria which
 "demanded that every deviation from the officially prescribed rules and
 regulations be denounced and punished without a moment's delay," Henze
 came to equate the enforced homogeneity of serial music in the 1950s with
 lingering fascism in his homeland: "so many people who had had a hand
 in things were now carrying on as if nothing had happened. . . . With
 the coming of the first strict serial compositions, the least glimmer
 of any political spark was finally extinguished in the midst of their
 creators" (<I>BFAA</I>, 34).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Henze returned to Darmstadt in 1955 to give a composition class with
Boulez and Bruno Maderna, he recalled that "anything that wasn't Webernian
was brusquely dismissed" (<I>BFAA</I>, 43). Other than Henze, very few
composers managed to resist the imperatives of what was already being
called "The Age of Webern." As a consequence of Webern's prime directive
that "all art must be constructed according to laws," on both sides
of the Atlantic "his scores were pored over in theory and composition
classes like Talmudic texts," with disdain heaped on any who resisted.
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>
 When Boulez dared

<B></B>

even to assert that "any musician who has not experienced . . . the
necessity for the dodecaphonic languages is <I>useless</I>, for his
whole work is irrelevant to the needs of the epoch," dissenters began
to speak of a new sort of "tyranny" surrounding Webern's oeuvre.
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 Even the seventy-three year old Stravinsky "came under the spell"
 and penned a short preface for the second issue of <I>Die Reihe</I>,
 dedicated exclusively to Webern on the occasion of the tenth anniversary
 of his death: "We must hail not only this great composer but also a
 real hero."
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 "There are heroes, and there are composers," quipped Schoenberg in 1944,
 suggesting that Shostakovich had (unfortunately) allowed politics to
 influence his compositional style: "Heroes can be composers and vice
 versa, but you cannot require it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF98" HREF="#FOOT98">98</a></SUP>
 That admonition pertains to music publishers as well. On the occasion of
 their ninetieth birthdays, Ludwig Strecker (who had outlived his brother
 Willy by 20 years) and Alfred Schlee were both duly feted on a heroic
 scale. In honor of Strecker, Schott published a 425-page <I>Festschrift
 f&uuml;r einen Verleger</I>. Among its 46 distinguished contributors
 were composers Francaix, Henze, Ligeti, Tippett, not to mention
 Philipp Jarnach and Werner Egk; musicologists and critics included
 Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht, Rudolph Stephan, H. H. Stuckenschmidt, and
 Helmut Federhofer. Carl Orff contributed the opening rhapsody, "Dank an
 Ludwig Strecker"; Hermann Reutter followed up with an "Hommage &aacute;
 Ludwig Emanuel Strecker." There is, of course, no hint anywhere in the
 volume of Strecker's own "right-wing sympathies." The <I>Festschrift</I>
 was edited by the doyen of German musicology, Carl Dahlhaus.
<SUP><a NAME="REF99" HREF="#FOOT99">99</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conversely, in 1991, in honor of Schlee's ninetieth birthday, no fewer
than 37 UE-composers wrote tribute pieces, which were then played by a
string quartet at a celebratory concert. Boulez was the official spokesman
for the occasion. "Universal Edition meant for us young composers the
Second Viennese School, and we wanted to belong. . . . And suddenly
we were standing in line with Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern, with their
politics, with their artistic goals," Boulez told <I>Die Zeit</I>. He
extolled the virtues of his publisher in terms that now seem rather
ambiguous:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Alfred Schlee always had his nose to the wind. . . . Nevertheless, the
 man is extraordinarily private. He never talks about himself. If you
 want to know something about him, you have to ask someone else. You can
 hardly pull anything out of him about what role he played after joining
 Universal Edition in 1927, most of all, about the time of National
 Socialism and the war years when he practically saved Anton von Webern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF100" HREF="#FOOT100">100</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By then, Schlee had, in fact, broken his silence about his pre-1945
years at UE by consenting to be interviewed for a retrospective issue
of the <I>Oesterreichische Musikzeitschrift</I> on the occasion of
the fiftieth anniversary of the Anschluss. The brief published excerpt
from a "detailed interview" with Lothar Knessl began with a disclaimer
that Schlee "did not want to make a contribution concerning his special
service in securing the survival of UE."
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 But his comments were almost entirely restricted to the preservation of
 materials that "would ensure that nothing would happen to put UE into
 a situation in which reestablishment of its international work at 'a
 time afterwards' might be rendered impossible." "My immediate concern,"
 he said,

<B></B>

"was not dedicated to the present, but to the future, something which
has always been in the forefront of my considerations."
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such elliptical generalities, of course, beg for precise particulars:
What did Schlee do in Berlin on a daily basis from 1933 to 1938, or
in Vienna from 1938 to 1945, other than looking beyond the present to
preserve UE's future? Was he a double-agent, an apolitical, modernist
"mole" in the enemy camp, pretending to answer to Petschull but actually
looking out for Kalmus's interests? Why had so prolific a writer, so
public a performer, so vociferous an advocate prior to the Anschluss,
chosen to remain virtually silent about his activities thereafter? His
"legendary privacy" would be maintained even in death, as his demise was
not announced, even within UE, until after his burial. Obituaries, cobbled
almost exclusively from an official press release belatedly issued by UE,
offer no new information to affirm, contradict, or supplement the hazy
picture of a modest and largely unsung hero of modern music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 Somehow, therefore, it was not a shock to discover that even the
 obviously well-thumbed folder labelled "Alfred Schlee" among the
 official files of the Reichsmusikkammer was empty--by the time it was
 microfilmed. Not even the required application for membership remained
 between its covers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Lotte Lenya returned for the first time to Vienna and Berlin in
1955, after twenty years' absence, she reported to a friend back home:
"By now we're used to the rubble, which they clean up religiously and
indefatigably. What a determination to get on top again! But you can't
find a single Nazi in Germany today. It's as if there weren't any."
<SUP><a NAME="REF104" HREF="#FOOT104">104</a></SUP>
 Apparently not in music publishing, a field in which collective amnesia
 has conspired to rehabilitate the opportunists, collaborators, and
 stalwarts alike. The deeds of the Petschulls and Streckers were quickly
 forgotten, forgiven, or transred, those of the Schlees filtered,
 blandished, and mythologized--all no less quickly and fully than their
 "black," "grey," and "white" political and industrial counterparts under
 the utilitarian policies adopted first by the occupation forces and
 then Christian-conservative politicians, as they tried to reconstruct
 Germany and Austria. Despite the difficulty today of disentangling
 aesthetic and musical issues from ideological, political, racialist, and
 personal ones, it is imperative that we begin the process of shedding
 light on the dark side of modern music publishing under the Nazis and
 its continuing impact on contemporary music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF105" HREF="#FOOT105">105</a></SUP>
 Within those shadows remain many unanswered, and perhaps already
 unanswerable, questions.

To date Schott has apparently rarely allowed scholars access to its

vetting of documents dating from 1933 to 1945, but they are not yet
available to researchers. I am grateful, however, to Marion von Hartlieb,
Managing Director of UE, and various department heads, who have answered
specific inquiries and provided photocopies of key documents relevant to
my research. In 1998, the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann appointed
an internationally constituted panel of scholars to examine its disputed
history during the Nazi era, when it became the leading publisher of
reading material intended for German soldiers. In a preliminary report
summarized in the <I>New York Times</I>, 18 January 2000, the commission
reported that the company's earnings increased eleven-fold from 1938 to
1941 and that one of its family leaders, Heinrich Mohn, belonged to a
circle of sponsoring members of the SS. After the war Mohn had explained
that "on occasion in earlier years" he had contributed sums to the Nazi

UE, for example, has deposited nearly 40,000 pieces of correspondence with

Casella , Milhaud , Bart&oacute;k , Kod&aacute;ly (1,124),
and Jan&aacute;cek . In some of these cases, however, it is
clear that these collections are not complete, especially during the
period from 1933 to 1945. The most helpful overview of music publishing
during this period is "Responding to the Market: Music Publishing in the

Hindemith wrote Willy Strecker on 26 April 1940: "I have had a long
letter from Hugo regarding the transfer of the rights and possible
reprint there. He makes some very good and farseeing proposals that will
allow everything to be maintained here on a permanent basis without
in principle making any changes in our mutual relationship--about
which I am very glad" (trans. in Skelton, <I>Selected Letters of Paul
Hindemith</I>, [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995], 161-2,
hereafter referred to as <I>Letters of Hindemith</I>). Associated Music
Publishers (AMP) had been founded in 1927 by Paul Heinicke as an agency
to represent European publishers, including both Schott and Universal
Edition, in the United States. It was subsequently purchased by BMI
(Broadcast Music Incorporated). After the war, AMP returned copyrights
in many wartime compositions to the European parent firms. For example,
on 8 November 1946, it assigned to Schott the copyright in Stravinsky's
<I>Danse concertante</I>, <I>Danse sacrale</I>, and <I>Symphony in Three
Movements</I>. This sort of "shell game," when successfully played,
exempted such works from the administrative bureaucracy of agencies such
as the U.S. Office of the Custodian of Alien Property, which administered
copyrights that fell under the provisions of the Enemy Alien Act. In
contrast, Weill requested the Custodian of Alien Property "to take over
the copyrights" of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I> in 1942, because Felix
Bloch Erben and Universal Edition "have been taken over long ago by the
Nazis and since <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I> was one of the first plays
which was banned by the Nazi government" (Letter to Howard Reinheimer,

Ministry had established STAGMA (Staatlich genehmigte Gesellschaft zur

and distributing royalties for the use of copyright music. Even after
they had been expelled from the Reichsmusikkammer or the country,
many non-Aryan or otherwise undesirable composers were allowed to keep
their memberships in STAGMA so that foreign royalties would continue to
flow into Germany, where they were often then impounded. Kurt Weill,

September 1933, and joined the parallel Italian society.

On 3 April, Heinsheimer wrote Weill that "the last eight days have been
so catastrophic that we are at present absolutely in the dark about the
further conduct of German business. Director [Hugo] Winter has gone to
Berlin in order to get information there and to see if there are any
prospects at all there. Under such circumstances, we will have to ask
you to accept 500 marks for April." Heinsheimer enclosed a personal
note with the official letter: "We are naturally quite aware of your
difficult position and will not leave you high and dry. But you must
understand the disastrous situation in which we find ourselves. The
German boycott, whose unofficial effects will be still worse than the
official ones, hits us squarely in the face." Weill responded immediately:
"I would like to say once again that I made a concession on this point
only because the understanding and trust that you and UE have for my
works seems great enough to warrant my making financial sacrifices,
which are not easy for me at the present time" (3 April 1933).

The matter was finally resolved, after months of heated correspondence,
in October 1933 at a meeting between Alfred Kalmus and Weill. The terms
of the settlement were summarized in a letter from Weill to UE dated 19
November 1933: UE would pay Weill the reduced stipends, and Weill agreed
to pay UE two percent of his future income deriving from his works, plus
additional sums if his income should exceed 100,000 francs. Meanwhile,
on 31 October 1933 Weill had signed a new contract with the Parisian
music publisher Heugel.

that an official response to his protest had arrived: "you and your
publisher may count on a benevolent neutrality." On 21 November 1938,
Strecker reassured Stravinsky that "the exhibit seems already to have
been forgotten in Germany." For an account of their reactions to the

player, since he was invited to play in national tournaments. I shared
gymnastic lessons with his daughters Elsbeth and Marion and also played
a great deal of tennis with both of them. His only son, who went to
school with my cousin Fritz, died in the war from a fever contracted
at the Russian front. There had always been rumors that Ludwig Strecker
was a Nazi, but he was probably too shrewd to become a registered party
member. According to my friend Gretel, a violent anti-Nazi, Willy had
never been a Nazi" (Letter to the author, 30 May 2000).

during my first trip to Vienna as the administrator of Weill's legacy, I
met Alfred Schlee, who was still serving as Artistic Director of UE at age
84. I requested to see the holograph score of <I>Die Dreigroschenoper</I>,
which was on deposit at the Wiener Stadt- und Landesbibliothek. From
his office in the Musikverein where pride of place was given over to
Webern's piano, Schlee dispatched Karl Heinz F&uuml;ssl, who had edited
the score for the 1972 Philharmonia Partitur No. 400, to retrieve the
manuscript. F&uuml;ssl returned, score in hand, its frail overleaf covered
with raindrops (their effects are still visible on it today). "It's
pouring out there," he muttered. Rendered almost speechless with the
realization that he had carried the holograph from the library without
any protection whatsoever during a heavy rainstorm, I suggested that
such treatment was inappropriate for so precious an artifact. F&uuml;ssl
laughed nervously, and, directing his comment more to Schlee than to me,
said that "Weill and Eisler didn't care about such things anyway." Since
1998 all holograph scores of works published by UE have been on deposit

"Webern as victim" conceit: "Taruskin can only offer opinion, supposition,
not fact, and to see the music quite so abjectly reduced to the status
of a sonic sponge absorbing external, cultural factors--though common
in New Musicological writing--is unpersuasive to anyone who feels that,
at the very least, the music's qualities transcend rather than helplessly
implement its ideological content."

case we should guard against seeing Schoenberg as a sort of Moses who
died in view of the Promised Land after having brought down the sacred
Tablets of the Law from a Sinai that some people obstinately want to
confuse with Valhalla. (Meanwhile, the 'Dance Round the Golden Calf'
is in full swing.)"

Stravinsky noted with regret that "the Webern cult [had] made the mistake
of switching from the music to the musician, a barren devotion in any
case, but especially so in this one because of the unexploitable nature of
the mahatma-to-be." Nevetheless, he concluded, "If you are seeking strange
gods you might do worse than continue to revere St. Anton." (Introductory

"50 Jahre Danach," 190-91. In a letter of 22 September 1999, Marion
von Hartlieb informed me that UE did not have a copy of the entire
"Gespr&auml;ch" with Knessl: "It was never published because, according
to Mr. Knessl's wife, Schlee never wanted it to be published." One is
struck by the similarity to Carl Orff's restriction of the eight-volume
documentation <I>Carl Orff und sein Werk</I> to "everything that the
composer wished to have known about his career." It too makes little
or no mention of his relationship to the Third Reich. "Let them pick
over my bones after I'm dead," he told Andreas Liess (<I>Carl Orff</I>,

UE's press release, "Music Publisher Alfred Schlee Celebrates His
95th Birthday on 19 November 1996" offers few additional specifics:
"His representation of UE for Germany, based in Berlin, took on a deeper
significance when Hitler's takeover created a difficult situation between
Universal Edition and German cultural institutions. Between 1938 and
1945, Schlee worked in Universal Edition's Vienna office. At that time,
he successfully resisted the transfer of UE to Germany."
