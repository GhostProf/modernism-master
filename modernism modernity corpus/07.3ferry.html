<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the title of this essay were "<I>Love</I> rhymes with <I>shove.,</I>"
it would probably make us smile. One reason would be that the second rhyme
word is unexpected: we would be likely to predict a more conventional,
decorous choice of echo for <I>love</I> in <I>dove</I> or <I>above.</I>
At the same time, <I>love</I>:<I>shove</I> is a familiar type of bathetic
rhyme designed to raise a smile in all sorts of humorous poetry, where
absurd pairings of like-sounding words are the traditional vehicle for
expressing what W. H. Auden called "comic contradiction."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  By contrast, <I>love</I>:<I>of</I> does not belong to a category
  of rhyme we would find in poetry we are typically used to. Such
  combinations virtually never appear in English poetry except in rare
  humorous verses until the nineteenth century, and even then they
  were seldom used and only for comic effect or for a formal reason
  such as to encourage enjambment. Rhymes like <I>love</I>:<I>of</I>
  have signifying possibilities that were first taken seriously in the
  early twentieth century because they satisfied the intentions of the
  modernist aesthetic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The premise of this discussion is that "<I>Love</I> rhymes with
<I>of.</I>" works in unique ways. Everyone who hears that title laughs,
not only because they had not thought of the rhyme before but because the
paired words are mismatched in a different, unfamiliar, and unsettling
way from either <I>love</I>:<I>dove</I> or <I>love</I>:<I>shove.</I>
Although the statement "<I>Love</I> rhymes with <I>of.</I>" is instantly
recognizable as true, it is true in a way hard to know how to think about;
it is outside our everyday patterns of thought and language. How it comes
to have these incongruent effects is both a conceptual and a historical
question that this essay will explore.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One clear signal the title gives is that what follows will be about
poetry and not prose, even though "<I>Love</I> rhymes with <I>of.</I>"

<B></B>

is a prose sentence that uses a rhyme to prove its statement. We tend
to associate rhyme with poetry as distinct from prose because we do not,
except in extraordinary instances, hear or think of like-sounding words
in prose speech or writing as rhymes: for instance in familiar phrases
like <I>the love of God</I> or <I>the god of love.</I> The reason for
this difference in response is that prose is not systematically arranged
to emphasize similarity of final sounds by their accent and syntactical
position, the way almost all rhymed poetry in English was structured
roughly from Chaucer to Tennyson.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Simply, rhyme in English poetry--described by T. V. F. Brogan as
"historically its single most consistent characteristic"--is the bringing
together into related positions in the verse of words that are partially
like in sound but differ in meaning.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  It is a specialized form of repetition since the linked words are not
  identical. Linguists describe the relationship between words that rhyme
  by various terms, among them: <I>consequence,</I> <I>consonance,</I>
  <I>convergence,</I> <I>equivalence,</I> <I>parallelism,</I>
  <I>symmetry.</I> Rhyme works rhetorically like a simile because both
  kinds of verbal patterning make a comparison in which perceived likeness
  at the same time calls attention to difference. In the paradigmatic
  instance of simile, Shakespeare's Sonnet 18, the beloved is like a
  summer's day and also is not. Structurally, a rhyme word placed at the
  end of the line works to mark off the line as a unit while binding
  together different lines by their like end sound. The prominence
  granted by their final position strengthens the double power of such
  rhymes to liken and distinguish, as does the traditional practice,
  recommended in theory until the nineteenth century, of having the
  metrical accent fall on the final syllable. End rhymes, empowered by
  their position to engage the reader most actively in recognizing both
  likeness and difference, are the subject of this discussion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"It is in the nature of rhyme to bring differences together and to reveal
the differences in likeness," according to Jurij Lotman's definition,
but the balance of the comparing and distinguishing effects of rhyme can
tilt in either direction between pairs of words, between whole poems,
or phases of an author's work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  The greater emphasis of poets on the closeness or distance between rhyme
  pairs has varied within the same period--particularly with respect
  to different genres--and from one period to another. Even so, there
  are signs that there has been a growing interest among poets writing
  in English over more than five centuries in widening the phonetic,
  structural, semantic, and grammatical gaps between words linked by
  resemblance of sound.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The discussion here proposes that the most radical phase of this
history, the practice revealing the most fundamental transformation
of attitudes toward the ordering of thought in the language of rhymed
poetry, is the acceptance by poets in the twentieth century of rhymes
like <I>love</I>:<I>of.</I> Their common appearance is witness to wide
recognition of truth in the paradoxical proposition that there are
legitimate conceptual grounds for such agrammatical rhymes in spite of
their inherent conceptual incompatibility.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Every reformation in English poetry has involved shifts in attitudes
toward rhyming, in the practices of it, and in the rules for its proper
conduct. A starting point for looking at this slow and unsteady movement
is in the sixteenth century. Then English writers--some of them theorists
as well as practitioners of rhyme--first explored the

<B></B>

state of their language as it was emerging from what Sir Philip Sidney
called "that mistie time" of the greatest poet England had yet boasted,
Chaucer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  The challenge these writers faced was to find support for their argument
  that poetry in English could achieve its own excellence without the
  inflectional grammar that had supported the unrhymed system of ancient
  verse and had left traces in the rhymed poetry of Chaucer and his
  followers. Chaucer himself had long ago complained of a "skarsete"
  of rhymes in the English he had to work with.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Inevitably, the sixteenth-century defenders of rhyme turned to the
new mode of endings that George Puttenham called "the cheife grace of
our vulgar Poesie," which "consisteth in the Symphonie," a synonym for
<I>rhyme</I> that meant at once likeness of sound and metrical accent
in particular, agreement or harmony in general.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  The "most auncient" vocabulary from "our naturall Saxon English" with
  its wealth of monosyllables supplied a high proportion of words with
  like sounds that could substitute for inflectional endings. They were
  preferred for end rhymes over words of more than one syllable because,
  as Puttenham said, the "<I>monosillables</I> of our English Saxons
  . . . do naturally and indifferently receive any accent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  This meant that at the end of the line they accommodated themselves
  inevitably to the pattern of masculine rhyme, the norm accepted in
  English poetry for most of its history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rhyme, scorned by classicists as new-fangled ornamentation--Thomas
Campion called it "childish titillation"--was defended on the grounds
of its fidelity to the structure of the English language and to its
"most auncient English" vocabulary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  George Gascoigne, in the earliest treatise on the making of English
  verse in rhyme, instructed poets that "the more monasyllables that
  you vse the truer Englishman you shall seeme."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Even though the argument for the naturalness of rhyme was made for
  its expedience, it was predicated on ways of thinking so widely and
  unquestioningly taken for granted, it seems, that there was no need
  to bring them to the surface in these earliest defenses of rhyme.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When Elizabethan writers recommended specifically monosyllables handed
down from "naturall Saxon English," they were essentially referring,
without having to say so, to nouns. Nouns made up a vast proportion of
the prized monosyllabic end rhymes, verbs a lesser share, adjectives
(still considered, as in Latin, to be a species of noun) and adverbs
together making up a very much smaller number than verbs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Since the position of end rhymes gives them a special prominence,
  their place would belong naturally to nouns and verbs, which are the
  parts of speech that chiefly determine the structure and carry the
  burden of meaning in a sentence, where for those reasons they are
  normally stressed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nouns that name what we can see and touch are the first words we are
taught as infants. They are the grammatical guides that help us most to
get along in the world, as anyone knows who has traveled in a foreign
country with only the most rudimentary knowledge of its language. Nouns
are the first category to be explained in any treatise on English grammar,
reflecting a hierarchical ordering of parts of speech that goes back to
antiquity. In the earliest English rhyming dictionary of 1570 the only
classes included are, in this order, nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nouns and verbs of Saxon origin in particular tend to be the names
for common things and events that make up ordinary life. (Many foreign
nouns were imported in the sixteenth century to supply English with a
vocabulary of terms for abstract concepts it had no words for.) Because
these things and events are part of everyday experience, the nouns and
verbs for expressing them were themselves recognizable realities. Their
solid familiarity gave them precedence over less essential words belonging
to other parts of speech, so that the hierarchical structure of English
grammar supported the use in poetry of rhymes that contribute most to the
making of "order and forme," which Samuel Daniel in "A Defense of Ryme"
claimed to be "pleasing to Nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The monosyllables paired in rhymes usually belonged to the same part of
speech, so they had the same grammatical meaning. That agreement meant
they filled the same function in structuring the mind's understanding of
order in the world. In sixteenth-century terms, pairing like grammatical
parts in rhyme induced the "certaintie" and "clozes" that Daniel believed
"the diuine power of the spirit" imposed on the poet's imagination to
bring about harmony.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  Grammatical agreement was an important instrument in the preferred
  aesthetic of rhyming, in concert with other agreements in sound, in
  syllabic structure, in metrical accent, and in closeness of lexical
  meaning or what Roman Jakobson called "semantic propinquity" (using
  <I>dove</I>:<I>love</I> as an example).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sequences that bind their member rhymes together by their likeness in
multiple features have threaded their recognizable way through English
poetry at least since the sixteenth century: <I>God</I>:<I>rod,</I>
<I>breath</I>:<I>death,</I> <I>womb</I>:<I>tomb,</I>
<I>lust</I>:<I>dust,</I> <I>tears</I>:<I>fears,</I>
<I>sleep</I>:<I>keep,</I> <I>name</I>:<I>fame,</I>
<I>prime</I>:<I>time,</I> <I>rhyme</I>:<I>chime,</I>
<I>trees</I>:<I>breeze,</I> <I>heart</I> (in the sixteenth century often
spelled <I>hart</I>): <I>part</I>:<I>smart</I>:<I>dart.</I> The series
<I>love</I>:<I>prove</I>:<I>move,</I> pronounced alike at least into the
eighteenth century (in poems by Pope, Gay, and Prior among others) has
gone on being a useful formula, perhaps because historically <I>love</I>
has been pointed out as a famously difficult word to find rhymes for.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  As recently as 1970, G. S. Fraser used it as his example in a discussion
  of the poverty of rhymes in English by comparison with languages
  rich in words with like endings: "<I>Amore</I> in Italian rhymes
  with <I>cuore</I>, but <I>love</I> in English perfectly only with
  the undignified word <I>shove</I> or the trivial word <I>glove</I>"
  (a conservative statement, we shall see, in the light of practice in
  twentieth-century poetry).
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first stanza of "Gascoignes good morrow" shows the focused interest
and expertise of sixteenth- and earlier seventeenth-century poets in
bonding like-sounding words by harmony among their various features,
to create verses that might be perceived as reflecting the divinely
given orders of nature and language. This was the prevailing ideal of
poetry that the laws for rhymed verse first explained by Gascoigne were
dedicated to fostering:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You that have spent the silent night,
<BR>
In sleepe and quiet rest,
<BR>
And ioye to see the cheerefull lyght

<B></B>
<BR>
That ryseth in the East:
<BR>
Now cleare your voyce, now chere your hart,
<BR>
Come helpe me nowe to sing:
<BR>
Each willing wight come beare a part,
<BR>
To prayse the heavenly King.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The stanza is composed of forty-four monosyllables, five words of
two syllables, and one of either two or three; the pattern of regular
iambic trimeter expected of the last line makes it most likely that
"heavenly" is contracted to two syllables, though since it is the most
significantly charged word and is positioned in the last line, it might
be allowed three.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The metrical arrangement of syllables is reinforced by the end rhymes,
themselves all monosyllabic nouns except "sing," which as an infinitive
works more like a noun than a verb. Beyond those syllabic and grammatical
symmetries, the paired words are close to one another in lexical meaning,
and not only those end words that agree in sound but also those that are
acoustically unlike. That is: "night" has the same semantic orientation as
"lyght" but also "rest"; "lyght" in turn is located by familiar Biblical
imagery in the same semantic field as "East." The pairing of "hart" and
"part" is so common in sixteenth-century poetry that their likeness
in sound could persuade, as Hugh Kenner said of proverbial rhymes,
"that they inhere in the workings of the normal mind";
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  "part" also has a semantic association with "sing" in the language of
  religious and other ceremonies because in choral music, which the poet
  in this stanza invites readers "to sing," each voice is assigned its
  "part."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Likeness of syllabic structure, and of lexical and grammatical meanings,
together with like sound, create a symphony that draws into its concert
even the rhyme words that are unlike in their vowel sounds: "night,"
"rest," "lyght," "hart," "part" all close on the sound of <I>t.</I> Only
the "heavenly King" demands a rhyme of His own, but one that agrees with
the uninterrupted accentual pattern of masculine rhyme.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These likenesses between words linked as end rhymes were conceived as
given not only in the senses that the same pairs were always at hand,
expected, and the more valued for having been so often repeated as to
have become proverbial truths. George Herbert, in the last two stanzas
of "A true Hymne," stated or--to use his own preferred verb--<I>copied
out</I> another understanding of rhyme as given:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
He who craves all the minde,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the soul, and strength, and time,
<BR>
If the words onely rhyme,
<BR>
Justly complains, that somewhat is behinde
<BR>
To make his verse, or write a hymne in kinde.
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
Whereas if th' heart be moved,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the verse be somewhat scant,
<BR>
God doth supplie the want.
<BR>
As when th' heart sayes (sighing to be approved)
<BR>
O, <I>could I love!</I> and stops: God writeth, <I>Loved.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<B></B>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">


Because agreements in many features of the rhymes together make the
harmony in these stanzas, as they do in Gascoigne's, the form of the
verses agrees closely with their sense so that form and sense themselves
can be said to rhyme. Herbert's title, which could serve equally for
Gascoigne's morning hymn, implies as much: to call a hymn <I>true</I> was
to describe it as being faithful to eternal verities and exact in form.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sixteenth- and earlier seventeenth-century prescriptions for end rhymes
were based on the hierarchy of grammatical parts in English, and reflected
the hierarchy of poetic kinds that the makers of the new vernacular
verse promoted (probably encouraged by the examples of modern Italian
and French poetry). Theorists like Puttenham condescendingly allowed
scattered departures from the accepted norm of monosyllabic masculine
rhyming in poems of lesser stature in the hierarchy of kinds:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
And the accented sillable with all the rest vnder him make the cadence
. . . but alwayes the cadence which falleth vpon the last sillable of a
verse is sweetest and most commendable: that vpon the <I>penultima</I>
more light, and not so pleasant: but falling vpon the <I>antepenultima</I>
is most vnpleasant of all, because they make your meeter too light and
triuiall, and are fitter for the Epigrammatist or Comicall Poet then
for the Lyrick and Elegiack, which are accompted the sweeter Musickes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This view gave poets license to vary details of their rhyming style
to suit verses of different kinds. The more elevated in rank demanded
rhyme pairs closest in sound and in other features that would mirror
concord in the creation. The humorous kinds that treat of disorderly
conduct and upset values, accidents and tricks might be served by words
mismatched in form and in lexical and grammatical meanings, which would
represent conflict in the human world and untrustworthiness in its
language: Sidney's "love":"shove"; Spenser's "handsomly":"I"; Donne's
"kinde":"blind-"/["nesse"], "away":"India," "or":"abhorre"; Jonson's
"love":"Glove," "embrace":"Pythagoras," "at a":"taffeta"; Herrick's
"Go on":"<I>Predestination,</I>" "Tiffanie":"the":"Sea."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The revolution in English poetry in rapid progress by 1700 was a
reordering of the hierarchy of kinds, again measured by new standards for
the proper practices of rhyming. These were laid out in 1702 by Edward
Bysshe in his respected treatise, <I>The Art of English Poetry.</I>
The kind of verse Bysshe took for granted as norm and ideal was rhymed
"Heroick Poetry," defined to be lines coupled by end rhymes, each line
made of exactly ten syllables arranged in iambs so that the final syllable
would be strongly accented. In his treatise Bysshe explained the more
minute formal regulations of the new verse, and included a dictionary
of "such Words only, as both for their Sence and Sound are judg'd most
proper for the Rhymes of Heroick Poetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By definition the strict criteria for heroic rhyme excluded schemes of
alternating end rhymes and divisions into stanzas, structures preferred by
earlier poets writing in the highly ranked "Lyrick and Elegiack" kinds;
in Bysshe's ranking "the Lyrick" was demoted to the same inconsiderable
status as "Burlesque" (<I>AEP,</I> 22). The stricter rules for insuring
the accent on the final syllable of the line and the closure at the end
of the couplet promoted close agreement rather than difference in accent
between the paired

<B></B>

words, and since the rhymes were adjacent, their accents were sharply
audible. At the same time, Bysshe's catalogue of exclusions listed
rhymes that are phonetically "too perfect," which, though "allowable
in the Days of <I>Spencer</I> and the other old Poets," are "not
so now; nor can there be any Musick in one single Note" (<I>AEP,</I>
23). His example-- "<I>Light</I>":"<I>Delight</I>"--makes clear that the
objection was specifically to pairs where not only the vowel sound but
the consonant before it are acoustically alike. Still, there is a more
general suggestion implicit here that though there were more and stricter
criteria for proper rhyming, agreement overshadowing all differences
between rhyme pairs was deliberately to be avoided in heroic couplets.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The same suggestion is implied by the silence in Bysshe's treatise and in
other discussions of heroic verse about the desirability of monosyllabic
rhymes, which typically come close to perfect agreement and were in large
part for that reason treasured and preserved by repeated use. In "An
Essay on Criticism" Pope used "<I>Breeze</I>":"<I>Trees</I>" (an instance
of the "too perfect" type of "<I>Light</I>":"<I>Delight</I>") to make
fun of the stock of "<I>unvary'd Chimes.</I> / With sure <I>Returns</I>
of still <I>expected Rhymes.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  Simple boredom must account to some degree for the lack of enthusiasm
  for familiar, monosyllabic nouns as end rhymes; a sense of historical
  distance from earlier and more impoverished stages of English must
  also have played a part. Beyond those causes, there seems to have been
  at issue conceptions of the origins and nature of rhyme that differ
  from the sense of it as given that informed the earlier enthusiastic
  practice of monosyllabic end rhyming.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Four couplets into Pope's "Windsor-Forest" is a set passage that, like
Gascoigne's and Herbert's stanzas, calls attention to its matching of
form to sense. These lines present themselves as a deliberate model
for poetry, and specifically for heroic rhyme ordered "harmoniously,"
"as the World" in its divinely intended form:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Groves of <I>Eden</I>, vanish'd now so long,
<BR>
Live in Description, and look green in Song:
<BR>
<I>These,</I> were my Breast inspir'd with equal Flame,
<BR>
Like them in Beauty, should be like in Fame.
<BR>
Here Hills and Vales, the Woodland and the Plain,
<BR>
Here Earth and Water seem to strive again,
<BR>
Not <I>Chaos</I>-like together crush'd and bruis'd,
<BR>
But as the World, harmoniously confus'd:
<BR>
Where Order in Variety we see,
<BR>
And where, tho' all things differ, all agree.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
<!--_/poetry-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like the earlier sort of poetry that Gascoigne's morning hymn represents,
Pope's "Song" celebrates a natural order where parts "all agree." Here
that emphasis is conveyed by adjacent masculine rhymes, closely matched
in sound, anchoring the ends of lines identical in number of syllables
and in positioning of accent. Agreement in these features always creates
the most immediate impression of harmony. Even so, the balance toward
closeness over distance in rhymes does not have the same effects in
Pope's lines as in Gascoigne's. Only four of Pope's ten end words here
are monosyllabic nouns,

<B></B>

and of them only "Flame" and "Fame" are paired together. "Song" is
linked in imperfect grammatical agreement with "long," while "Plain" is
mismatched both grammatically and in syllabic structure with "again." The
distance is not disturbing, as it deliberately is in the examples quoted
earlier of unruly comic rhymes, but it does allow space for "Variety"
within the measured "Order" of rhymes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Pope's end words do not belong to the metalanguage of conventional rhyme
that Gascoigne used when he joined "night" with "lyght" or "hart" with
"part." These were commonplaces passed on from poem to poem so that
readers could participate easily by predicting the completion of the
chime, singing their part in the song. Pope selected his words from a much
larger and more various vocabulary. The echo of the first paired word by
the second could not be predicted in these couplets (except perhaps the
perfect match of "Flame" and "Fame," used more than once in Sir John
Denham's "Cooper's Hill," the model of descriptive verse imitated in
"Windsor-Forest").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The introduction of variety and unexpectedness within the strict
order of structure and sound in the rhymes makes readers aware of the
poet's acts of choosing and bringing the end words together in these
couplets. Authorial presence is more strongly felt than in Gascoigne's
hymn, where the poet is a voice summoning us to join him in a choir of
other voices all singing their given parts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course this awareness of the poet fetching rhymes is stronger in
Pope's satires, where the "uncommon," "Low," and "Miscompounded Words"
allowed by Bysshe only in humorous verse widened the distances between
rhymed words in lexical and grammatical meanings, as well as in syllabic
structure. Still, Pope even in satires took care to avoid the most extreme
form of disagreement between rhyme pairs that would result from drawing
on those parts of speech Bysshe altogether outlawed as words that "ought
not to end a Verse; as the Particles <I>An,</I> <I>And,</I> <I>As,</I>
<I>Of,</I> <I>The,</I> &amp;c" (<I>AEP,</I> n.p.).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the heroic couplets of Pope's pastoral poem, the role of the poet in
shaping the "Description" is called to attention by that word itself;
by "seem," which shows him engaged in interpretation; and most strongly
by the line "Where Order in Variety we see" (its internal rhyme adding
to its variety and unexpectedness). We readers see the multitudinous
classes of things in the phenomenal world unified in a single design
because the poet's rhymes are models of the way "tho' all things
differ, all agree." In the closing pair of lines, the first proposes a
definition of order in "the World"; the answering line defines the heroic
couplet. Together they characterize the ideal of heroic poetry in rhyme,
where, Pope wrote in "An Essay on Criticism," "The <I>Sound</I> must seem
an <I>Eccho,</I>" that is, a rhyme, "to the <I>Sense</I>" ("EC," 281).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The aesthetic of heroic rhyme agreed with the earlier ideal of symphonic
rhyming in the sense that both assumed the existence of a grandly
inclusive order in the phenomenal world and in language. Throughout this
extended period, in spite of shifts in the hierarchy of kinds, English
poetry accepted rhyme as the expressive instrument of some overarching,
unifying authority. Even so, historical differences distinguished
between the conceptions of rhyme so authorized. In the earlier period,
proverbial rhymes were conceived as divinely given repositories of truth
preserved and handed down in poems. In eighteenth-century heroic rhyme,
the poet was accepted as an

<B></B>

intermediary authority gifted in the art of finding adequate form in
rhymes to express universal truths, a process Pope summed up in his famous
maxim: "What oft was <I>Thought,</I> but ne'er so well <I>Exprest</I>"
("EC," 273).

In revolutions of English poetry rhyme has always been a charged issue,
its defenders and attackers debating on one or the other side as to
whether it fosters truth to nature in poetry or thwarts it. By the late
1700s dissatisfaction with heroic rhyme became a force in the revolution
against what the makers of new poetry considered the all-inclusive
artificiality of eighteenth- century verse. This revolt surfaced, and has
done so intermittently ever since, in two forms. Edward Young, looking
back to <I>Paradise Lost</I> as the ideal model of what Milton called its
"<I>English</I> Heroic Verse without Rime," set an example along with
Thomson's and Cowper's by eschewing rhyme altogether in long poems.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  While Wordsworth followed this course, other poets of his time and later
  tried out rebellious experiments with variously new ways of rhyming.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To this point in the discussion it has been possible, with considerable
simplification, to recognize and describe preferred forms of English
rhymed poetry roughly from Gascoigne's generation to Pope's, and to
extrapolate from them a common sense of language and its place in
the world. To borrow from Clive Scott's description of French verse of
comparable periods, poetry in English before the later 1700s was generally
predicated on the assumptions that there is accessible to poetry "some
underlying unity in the world," that "the relationship between signifier
and signified is direct, unmediated, and unproblematic," that "semantic
closure is perfectly achievable and truth utterable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As these assumptions began to unravel--for the many complex reasons
too often discussed to need summarizing here--the possibility of a new
aesthetic with a dominant ideal of form in rhymed verse dwindled as well,
and for the same reasons. Various poets experimented with new ways of
rhyming that were informed by an assortment of literary and metaphysical
attitudes and impulses, but showed a common interest in freeing poetry
from the unnaturally strict regularity and the too predictable closure
of the heroic couplet. That impulse encouraged, among several poets
writing in the early 1800s who were influential throughout the century,
the preference for paired end words that differ more than they agree in
formal features and in lexical and grammatical meanings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Loosening the likeness in sound between rhymed words was the most
widespread form of revolt, a practice that rhymed poetry in English
has not turned away from since. Blake set an early example in such
pairs as "tomb":"come" and "lawn":"morn" that later poets expanded
by enlarging the gap. Some examples are: Keats's "patiently":"sigh";
Elizabeth Barrett Browning's "fewer":"poor"; Emerson's "fell":"oracle";
Longfellow's "woods":"solitudes"; Dickinson's "indeed":"instead";
Swinburne's "love":"enough." Coleridge launched a different attack
on heroic rhyme in his experiments with classical meters. By their
admission of trisyllabic feet, they invited end rhymes mismatched in
syllabic structure and placing of accent like "hospitality":"jealousy,"
and especially paired feminine with masculine rhymes:

<B></B>

"unless":"loveliness"; "suddenly":"be." Keats tried out the curious
effects of making the rhymed couplet straddle separate sentences:
"Will trace the story of Endymion. / The very music of the name has gone."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Poets writing in traditional rhymes at least since the time of Shakespeare
have occasionally allowed themselves prepositions as end words when they
act as part of a verb in what linguists now call <I>phrasal verbs</I>
or <I>prepositional verbs.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  Instances are: Shakespeare's "drinkes it vp":"cup"; Herbert's "creeps
  in":"sinne"; Milton's "bout":"drawn out"; Wordsworth's "passing
  by":"jeopardy"; Tennyson's "floated by": "high." For a considerable
  number of nineteenth-century poets this kind of grammatical formula
  offered an effective escape from the artificiality of diction they
  objected to in eighteenth-century poetry.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Browning heard in such phrases the authentic note of colloquial speech,
particularly when the preposition stands out at the end of the line at
some distance from the verb: "look backward for," "Telling ought but
honest truth to." Hardy, above all, showed interest in such phrasal
rhymes, using them to create a sense of a speaking voice coming through
strictly ordered meters and rhyme schemes. He often ended lines with
colloquial expressions like "worth living for," "found herself in," "know
nothing of," "thought nothing of," <I>of</I> being specially useful for
many of his poems by offering a rhyme with <I>love</I> that was neither
trite nor trivial. Probably in large part because of Hardy's effective
use of these phrases, Marianne Moore praised him as the master of the
"unaccented terminal rhyme."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shelley violated traditional rhyming practices by different and more
radically subversive use of end rhymes made from prepositions and other
parts of speech on Bysshe's list of words altogether excluded from
serious rhymed verse: "the Particles <I>An,</I> <I>And,</I> <I>As,</I>
<I>Of,</I> <I>The,</I> &amp;c." As late as 1845, when the revolt against
the heroic couplet could declare itself victorious, an encyclopedia
article on grammar cited in the <I>OED</I> called particles "inferior
Parts of speech." What made particles attractive to Shelley, it seems,
was their potential--when not built into a phrasal or prepositional
verb--for enjambing lines of verse. A word like <I>of</I> when part of
a phrase acts as a modifier or intensifier of the verb preceding it, as
in <I>to make of</I> (where <I>of</I> gives the verb phrase a different
meaning from <I>to make</I>). When not part of a such a phrase, <I>of</I>
has the function of connecting or relating, for instance in <I>the
love of God</I>; it points forward to the word that must complete its
significance. Hence these lines from Shelley:

My reading turned up fewer than a handful of such rhymes in
Shelley's work. Other rare instances of lines enjambed by means of
articles, conjunctions, and prepositions are sprinkled about in later
nineteenth-century verse, particularly in poems by Christina Rossetti,
Swinburne, and Hardy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Gerard Manley Hopkins made a sort of quasi-mystical system that allowed
inclusion of those parts of speech in rhymes. His idiosyncratic sprung
rhythm encouraged various departures from traditional practices of
syllabic structure and placing of accent. His equally personal ways of
thinking about rhyme--that "any two things however unlike are in something
like," that "all beauty may by a metaphor be called rhyme"--justified
pairing words to any degree like in sound, however unlike in grammatical
and lexical meaning:
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  "England":"and"; "the":"thee"; "or":"snowstorm"; "busy to":"unvisited";
  "on":"Communion"; "of":"Love." Before the nineteenth century, these
  end rhymes would have been allowed only in humorous poems (though not
  in Pope's heroic satire).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once the nineteenth-century experiments with wider distances between
rhymed words in sound, syllabic structure, and accent grew familiar
in the work of greater numbers of poets not otherwise much alike,
those new rhymes could be taken seriously. More or less extravagant
disagreements in these three features slowly began to be tolerated;
they were expansions of traditional rhyme that did not destroy its
conformity with our everyday patterns of thought and language. In the
same period, rhymes like <I>love</I>:<I>of</I> were not so absorbed, as
the reception of Hopkins, who died in 1889, to some degree reflects. His
poems first appeared as a collected volume in 1918, but it was not until
the mid-1930s that they were acclaimed, revealingly, as the work of a
<I>modern</I> poet. This valuation was due in considerable part to his
radical innovations in rhyme. On the basis of Hopkins's contributions
to the movement toward allowing more extreme innovations in rhyming,
T. S. Eliot in the mid-1930s in his introduction to a volume of poems
by Marianne Moore, included Hopkins's work among what he considered at
that time to be "the best contemporary poetry."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is not altogether an exaggeration to say that the possibilities of
rhyme were reconceived in 1916 when Marianne Moore in a poem with the
arresting title "The Just Man And" used an end rhyme of "the" with "be."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  Her first readers had good cause to respond with amused bafflement
  not only to the grammatically odd title, but to what they would have
  taken to be a radically unbalanced end rhyme that paired the most
  significantly charged verb in the English language with an article. We
  have evidence that even sophisticated readers of contemporary poetry,
  Moore's fellow poets, had much the same sort of initial response
  that on a lesser scale we have to the sentence "<I>Love</I> rhymes
  with <I>of.</I>"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
William Carlos Williams allied himself with Moore in sharing the
overarching aims of "all the moderns" to "separate the poetry from
the subject," to insist that "pure craftsmanship joins hard surfaces
skilfully," and to do without "<I>ex machina</I> props of all sorts,
without rhyme, assonance, the feudal master beat, the excuse of 'nature,'
of the spirit, mysticism, religiosity, 'love,' 'humor,' 'death.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Still, even Williams, who believed that

<B></B>

"Marianne Moore is of all American writers most constantly a poet,"
acknowledged the "incomprehensibility of her poems."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  He complained that the "only help I ever got from Miss Moore toward
  the understanding of her verse was that she despised connectives,"
  another feature of the modernist aesthetic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Williams gave these accounts of his responses to Moore's poems in the
early 1920s. In 1935, Auden made what he later called his "silliest
critical blunder" when he "could not make head or tail" of the work
newly gathered in Moore's <I>Selected Poems.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  Wallace Stevens, commenting on that volume, described its aesthetic as
  "new," its style as "unique," and Moore as a "complete disintegrator"
  and an "equally complete reintegrator."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  Eliot, who edited the selection, introduced her as a poet of "original
  sensibility"--"Miss Moore has no immediate poetic derivations"--who
  "found her rhythm, her poetry, her appreciation of the individual word,
  for herself" ("I," xiv, ix, x). He praised her for "startling us into
  an unusual awareness" likely to cause "bewilderment" to the point where
  it would sometimes be "difficult to say what is the 'subject-matter'"
  of a poem ("I," x, xi). Stevens registered the same response when he
  said of Moore's poems, "Subject, with her, is often incidental."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  Without admitting to the incomprehension that Williams and Auden openly
  confessed, Eliot's introduction implies that readers of Moore's poems
  must retrain their ways of thinking to understand the workings of
  her mind and language, as different from ours as the operations of
  "a high-powered microscope" ("I," x).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The formal feature of Moore's poems that Eliot thought readers would
find most baffling, since he gave it most attention in his introduction,
was her use of rhyme, "in itself an innovation in metric" ("I," xii). He
began his lesson with a description of rhyme as it was practiced by
poets writing in English before his generation:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In the conventional forms of rhyme the stress given by the rhyme tends
to fall in the same place as the stress given by the sense. The extreme
case, at its best, is the pentameter couplet of Pope. Poets before and
after Pope have given variety, sometimes at the expense of smoothness,
by deliberately separating the stresses, from time to time; but this
separation--often effected simply by longer periods or more involved
syntax--can hardly be considered as more than a deviation from the norm
for the purpose of avoiding monotony. ["I," xii]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More recently, some poets contemporary with Moore and Eliot had made the
modernist choice with Williams to dismiss rhyming altogether. Others had
asserted their modernity with regard to rhyme by using it "here and there
to make a pattern directly in contrast with the sense and rhythm pattern,
to give a greater intricacy" ("I," xii). Although Moore publicly claimed
to despise rhyme on principle, she was one of these (she owned a rhyming
dictionary that she said was "indispensable").
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This rhyming against the pattern of sense and stress Eliot separated
into two kinds, "heavy or light," saying that of "the <I>light</I>
rhyme Miss Moore is the greatest living master; and indeed she is the
first, so far as I know, who has investigated its possibilities" ("I,"
xiii). What he meant he illustrated partly by quoting the opening end
rhymes of two stanzas from "The Fish" (a poem with a conventional-seeming
title that turns out to be the grammatical subject of a sentence ending
part way through the second stanza).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The innovative effects of Moore's kind of light rhyme, Eliot explained,
were "sometimes obtained by the use of articles as rhyme words," as in

Both the words that initiate the rhymes in these two opening couplets
would be called light because as articles they are regularly unstressed
in a sentence and unaccented in verse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Words of this category (articles, conjunctions, and prepositions to which
modern grammarians have added demonstratives) are fundamentally different
from the parts of speech traditionally allowed in rhyming. They have a
function in relation to other words but no inherent signifying capacity:
by themselves they refer to nothing. The problem they present to rhyming
is not the proverbial difficulty of pairing apples and oranges, nor even
apples and umbrellas, but something more like the challenge of comparing
apples with D, which, like <I>an</I> or <I>the,</I> is a sign without
what linguists call <I>descriptive content.</I> It is for these reasons
as well as for their light stress that such words, described by Charles
Tomlinson as "the humbler components of language," were for centuries
denied the prominent position of end rhymes in serious verse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moore's way of undermining the ranking of grammatical parts that dictated
traditional rhyming practice was to seem innocently unaware of it. In "The
Fish" she slyly tucked her two stanzas beginning with the most subversive
form of rhyme--"an":"fan" and "the":"sea"--among three other stanzas
that are built in the same unconventional lineation and rhyme scheme but
that play by traditional rules in being made out of acceptable parts of
speech: "wade":"jade," "sun":"spun," "pink":"ink." Yet that grammatical
distinction, which is the predication of our ordinary ways of thinking
about the nature of language and how it works, is blandly ignored. Or it
is swept out of sight by insistence on the agreement among these two forms
of rhyme by exact repetition of their other than grammatical features.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opening rhyme words in all five stanzas are notably similar in
size. They are all constructed out of two, three, or four letters packaged
in one syllable (letters and syllables are what Moore in "Poetry" partly
meant by "the raw material of poetry") and arranged in the identical,
distinctive pattern of lines. This makes a strong impression of a single,
clearly shaped design repeated all down one page as spaced in <I>Selected
Poems.</I> The emphasis on exact structural repetition works against
the hierarchical differentiation

<B></B>

and demotion of "an" and "the": these articles are among their
equals. In some way that matters, this declaration defines the rhymes
with satisfactory precision, clearing away the distortions imposed by
convention, sifting the "genuine" from the "derivative" (to quote again
from "Poetry").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The last three stanzas of "The Fish," all down the facing page in this
edition, bring this suggestion of conceptual equality a little closer to
the surface, it may be as a way of testing our progress toward recognizing
what has not been said in words but red in their shape, structure,
and arrangement (perhaps what Moore hinted by saying of her poems,
or all poems, that "Form is synonymous with content--must be"):

The words that make up the opening rhymes in these stanzas (all departures
from traditional rhyme following the directions of nineteenth-century
experiments) do not closely mirror the look of those on the opposite
page. They are made with anywhere from two-plus-hyphen to seven
letters. Two are capitalized because they begin a sentence (not because
lines of poetry used always to begin with capitals). One is followed
by a period (marking the end of the sentence not coterminous with the
stanza). Two are trisyllabic with the rhyme falling on the unaccented
last syllable. One, "ac-/ cident," is broken off as if by accident but
of course by design to make the components of the word fit the syllabic
pattern of the lines.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These stanzas offer a potpourri of irregular rhymes in various forms
all different both from the radical combinations of "an":"fan" or
"the":"sea" and from the traditional pairs like "wade":"jade." Even so,
their identical arrangement of syllables --without regard to where the
accent falls--is the measure and proof of their common nature and their
equality: any word or even any syllable (Moore once pointed out that
"Everyone writes in syllables!") is raw material for rhyming.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opening end rhymes in the last three stanzas of "The Fish" also have
in common that they use a different kind of word from those in the first
five stanzas. Besides

<B></B>

being more complexly built out of more than one syllable, these longer
words contrast with the semantic simplicity of the earlier rhymes, almost
like ones in a children's book. We might be likely to describe "external,"
"ac-/ cident," and "Repeated" as words more conceptual, more explanatory,
more weighted with meaning. These are all ways of describing them that
make them seem more serious or dignified, deeper: certainly more so than
"an" or "the," but also than "wade" or "fan" or "pink." And "dead."--its
finality visibly red by the "." that constitutes one of its parts--is
tempting to single out as the most important word in the poem.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But to give in to that temptation would be to disregard what Moore's
repetition of her stanza form based on exact syllabic count does to her
craftily chosen end rhymes. It equalizes them as if they were digits,
and "mathematics" is one of the preferred terms Moore used to describe
her syllabic verse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  Ranking words in a hierarchy of lexical meanings that makes "dead." more
  important than -"ed" (or "an" or "pink") is as distorting to an
  understanding of the nature and workings of rhyme as traditional
  grammatical snobbery. So is generic ranking. The trick of breaking
  off a syllable from the front of a word is pulled out of the bag of
  conventions associated with comic verse, but here the play with "ac-
  / cident" occurs in a context that is not comic, where it makes a
  serious point: the synonymity of form and content.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It seems that Moore's rhymes in "The Fish," matching words that belong
to wholly unreconcilable parts of speech, are prized for their power
to shock us. They can jolt us into new ways of thinking about rhyme and
what it tells us about the nature of language and of poetry, making those
concerns part of Moore's characteristically opaque subject-matter (along
with such others as the unknowable mystery of the natural world, and its
ways of overturning our sense of relations among time and space, outward
and inward, surface and depth). "The Fish" seems to be leading us to see
beyond, beneath, through the "external" conventions--their analogues may
be worn-off "cornices"--that dictated centuries of rhyming practice. The
particular lens "The Fish" implicitly offers as an instrument to focus
our looking is the "Repeated / evidence" of its rhymes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another poem of Moore's brings end rhymes of the most iconoclastic kind
into sharper focus by using them to open four of its five stanzas:
"those":"echoes," "and":"hand," "a":"Persia," ["pear":"square,"]
"to":"su-." Like "The Fish," the poem itself begins with what is called
a run-on title: a phrase in the title space that starts a grammatical
sequence in the text. In this instance it starts a series of phrases and
clauses with no predicate but stopped by a period thirty lines later in
the second to last line of the second to last stanza:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The close, multiple likenesses between the three words of the title and
the first three words of the opening line--grammatical units in identical
order made of identical

<B></B>

demonstratives and adjectives modifying monosyllabic plural nouns--are
signals that the phrases are to be read in <I>apposition</I>. As
grammarians define the term, it means that these parallel phrases have
the identical reference; what they refer to the first rhymed couplet
points at. "Scalpels" and "sounds," themselves naming two classes of
phenomena seeming as nearly resistant to comparison as the grammatical
classes of "those" and "echoes," nevertheless both refer to, or are
analogues for, rhyme. The rest of the long, incomplete sentence catalogues
other entities: some "repeating . . . in reverse order," "all alike,"
"of uniform / and at the same time diverse, appearances." These phrases
tell us the items listed have in common that they, along with "Scalpels"
and "sounds," are references to, or are analogues for, rhymes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the last stanza, "these things" (the shift from "those" to "these"
locating the listed items nearby where the reader can see them on the
page) are collectively described as "rich / instruments with which to
experiment; naturally." Uncharacteristically, Moore's poem comes close to
explicitness here about what its subject-matter might be: experimental
rhyming. What its experiments discover about words, language, poetry,
and their relation to "things" in the phenomenal world, the poem expresses
only implicitly, very often obscurely.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Collective terms given in the last stanza and in the catalogue preparing
for it are unreliable in that they are not uniformly applicable to the
items listed. For instance, "things" names a category that scalpels
would usually be said to belong to (a more specific category would be
"instruments"), but not sounds. We would ordinarily be more likely to
call them by a term for intangible phenomena like <I>effects.</I> The
inclusive description given in stanza three--"a collection of little
objects"--would more emphatically exclude "sounds" because in our
habits of speech <I>object</I> more strictly than <I>thing</I> refers
to something we can see and touch, except in the grammatical sense of
<I>object.</I> (That meaning, we shall see, comes close to the surface
here.) The use of these ill fitting collective terms seems pointed when
contrasted with the way similar classifications in "The Jerboa"--"small
things," "little paired playthings"--are used to describe objects that
all belong equally to those categories.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even when exclusively visible and tangible things are listed together
as analogues for rhyme, they do not all have littleness in common. In
the sequence of "pear / and three bunches of grapes, tied with silver:
your dress, a magnificent square / cathedral tower," the "square /
. . . tower" is way out of scale in size with (though linked by sound to)
"pear." Beyond that, none of the items except "pear" and "grapes" seems
to have anything in common with the others as we ordinarily experience
them, so we find no grounds for comparing them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other res for rhyme in the catalogue present a different kind
of obstacle to comparison, compounded by the problems that Moore's
characteristically idiosyncratic punctuation puts in the way of
grammatical clarity. Some closely parallel phrases point to likenesses
in form and meaning among various analogues for rhyme while they also
intersect with other parallel phrases belonging to an altogether unrelated
field and sometimes a different ontological sphere. Here is a set of
examples from stanza two that shows this layering of parallels as if
"successively at random":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The phrases "your raised hand," "your cheeks," "your other hand"
(following "your hair," "your ears," "your eyes" in the first stanza)
are closely drawn parallels between parts of the body "re- / peating
. . . in reverse order" and rhyme. Then "your cheeks, those rosettes"
seems to set up a different kind of parallel, not drawing on repetition
of words, syntax, and semantic orientation, but on "intermingled echoes"
of famous poems in the tradition epitomized by Robert Burns's "My love is
like a red, red rose." The continuation in the next line of the clause
begun by "those rosettes" pushes aside the conventional simile--<I>your
cheeks are like roses</I>--and replaces it with an unexpected comparison
joining things so remotely similar that the parallel is almost buried
(as are the "lances all alike" that are "partly hid" by jeweled ornaments
in stanza three).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the final phase of layering, "those rosettes" is joined, by the rhyme
it initiates, with "those regrets." The lexical incompatibility of these
rhymed words is as difficult to resolve in its way as the grammatical
disagreement between end words in the kind of rhyme represented
by <I>love</I>:<I>of</I> (a pairing Moore used once, in "The Paper
Nautilus"). The untraversable lexical distance between "rosettes" and
"regrets" (which also bear no discoverable resemblance to other end
words), points to the conclusion that the parallel depends solely on
likeness of sound, absolutely independent of intelligibility.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here the rhyme is used as a lens to bring into focus a modern and
modernist view of language and its relation to the phenomenal world
that Malcolm Bowie described as fundamental to work by French poets of
Val&eacute;ry's generation, who were Moore's older contemporaries:

Sound-system and sense-system are heterogeneous, and the mystical echoes
which many nineteenth-century writers had heard traveling between them,
and suggesting the existence between them of some unfathomable kinship,
are heard no more. The relations between them are now a source of
intellectual tension and excitement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Moore's poems, with special concentration in "Those Various Scalpels,"
they are also an encouragement to obliqueness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The rhyme "those rosettes":"those regrets" diagrams in little the great
divide between sound and sense, while the parallel between "Those Various
Scalpels," and "those various sounds" does something else that the poem
wants us to find primary. Or so it seems to suggest in the question
straddling its last lines: "But / why dissect destiny with instruments
which / are more highly specialized than the tissues of destiny itself?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By describing the rhymes in the poem (including the one completed
in the question itself where "which" echoes "rich / experiments") as
"more highly specialized" than need be for discovering a new way of
understanding rhyme, the closing question raises playful doubts about
the necessity for the extravagant obliqueness of the poem's

<B></B>

procedures. Its collective categories that seem not wholly applicable
to what they describe, and its layering of parallels, analogues,
comparisons to rhyme based on distant or obscure or undiscoverable
likenesses, are "too highly specialized." The question hints at a
simpler, primary understanding of the issues in the poem that the poem
has not directly led us to, has "disguised," "hid," made "indistinct" or
"ambiguous": all words sprinkled inconspicuously among the items in the
catalogue. This obscured but basic understanding is discoverable in the
opening rhyme words that end adjacent lines in each stanza, even though
here the exaggeratedly uneven lengths of the coupled lines puts a wide
distance between the rhymes so that their "echoes" are "indistinct."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As in "The Fish," the first member of each pair is a single word by
itself constituting the line, so that it is isolated for scrutiny as if
in the visual field of a microscope. When we look at the one seemingly
ill-fitting instance of "pear," we can picture--cannot prevent ourselves
from picturing--an object, much as it would be drawn on the page of a
children's book with PEAR written below. When we stare through the lens at
"those," "and," "a," or "to" we see only letters making a word. We may
hardly be aware of its sound because the echo that calls attention to it
takes so long to be heard. Still, because "pear" is placed in a sequence
of other words of similar size and identical position doing the same
work of rhyming, they are all understood to belong to a common category.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although "those," "and," "a," "to" cannot be included among "a collection
of little objects" in the phenomenal sense, they can be objects in the
grammatical sense--as Moore used the word in the title of her essay
"Subject, Predicate, Object"--because they all belong, equally with
"pear," to the category of word, and any word appreciated for itself,
which Eliot praised Moore for doing, is a noun. In their own simple terms,
"those," "and," "a," "to" lead us to read the title-sentence of this
essay as stating the obvious: that "<I>Love</I> rhymes with <I>of.</I>"
must be understood to mean "the word <I>love</I> rhymes with the word
<I>of.</I>" What binds <I>love</I> and <I>of</I> together beyond their
likeness of sound has nothing to do with their lexical and grammatical
meanings, but everything to do with their common nature and status as
words. Purely as words, stripped of all conventional misconceptions
about them, they become nouns. Stevens was perhaps the first besides
Moore among their contemporaries to recognize and use the ontological
truth of this grammatical event in poems: he condensed it in his famous,
playful, only seemingly obscure phrase "The the."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The primary understanding of language that Moore's radical rhymes lead
to is more widely based even than the recognition that sound and sense
are heterogeneous. In "Those Various Scalpels," her iconoclastic rhymes
bring into sharp focus the unbridgeable ontological gap between words
and the phenomena they point to "at random." What Williams said in his
discussion of all true poems can equally describe the words that Moore's
poems are made with: that they have "a separate existence uncompelled
by nature or the supernatural."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  Necessarily the rhymes they make do not echo some universal harmony
  but only their own phonetic effects, and the poet does not act in the
  poem as an intermediary authority who discovers the conjunction of
  language with phenomena of this world or beyond it.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The poet of "The Fish" is as rigorously excluded as grammar will allow,
although the extravagantly strict arrangement and minute word play in
the poem call attention to the suppressed poet's verbal feats. "Those
Various Scalpels," implies the presence of an agent shaping the raw
material of the poem by another of Moore"s inconspicuous scatterings
of words with like associations: "struck," "sculptured," "sown," "set,"
"made," "tied," "Whetted." Beginning with "struck" in the opening lines,
they hint at the work of an artisan skilled in using the tools of various
trades. Simultaneously, the first stanza res the poet as a performer
at a street fair, striking sounds "from thin glasses successively at
random," publicly making private and precarious music.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moore's small, simple opening rhyme words are ordinary, unspecialized
verbal objects like "glasses": everyday things put to use as musical
instruments. The tune they play fulfills the antipoetic ideals of
modernism. Though "indistinct," creating what Sylvia Adamson described
as the "illusion of a natural speech which falls into rhyme almost
accidentally,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
  the "sounds" made by the artisan-street-performer-poet can be
  heard among the "highly specialized" experiments that are also a
  characteristic of modernist poems. Yet another of their defining
  features is their capacity to make fun of their own obscurity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elizabeth Bishop remembered that Marianne Moore "made contemporary
poets self-conscious about their crudities, afraid to rhyme 'bone' with
'stone,'" and that once Moore congratulated her for the (Moore-ish)
rhyme "antennae" with "many."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Auden admitted to having "stolen a great deal" from Moore, and by 1936
  was himself rhyming <I>love</I> with <I>of</I>; Moore took amused
  notice that he was not "too fettered to use 'who,' 'he,' 'the,' or
  'which,' as an end rhyme."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
  Richard Wilbur acknowledged having been "very charmed" by Moore's poetry
  and "undoubtedly influenced" by it, and the repeated evidence of James
  Merrill's rhymes makes it entirely likely that he learned from hers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  The examples of these and other strong poets following Moore have made
  her most vehemently anticonventional rhymes accessible for poets to
  use for their own, quite different, effects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Something like this assimilation or accommodation has followed every
revolution in rhyming. According to Henry Lanz, when the "classical rules
are violated . . . so frequently that the poets' disregard for them can
no longer be considered a mere license," then for "many poets licenses
become rules. Out of the chaos of individual experiments new principles
begin to arise."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
  A further dimension of this process is that when subversive rhymes
  become accepted practice among the poets whose influence defines the
  norms for their generation, then those rhymes have a different role
  in the production of meaning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A sequence of couplets in Thom Gunn's "Memoirs of the World" can show this
transformation of anticlassical rhyming, even of Moore's most radical,
agrammatical type: <I>of</I>:<I>love.</I> The contrast in rhyming effects
is sharpened because the passage from Gunn's poem bears some resemblance
to "The Fish" in that it leads the reader to look into the depths at
aquatic creatures seen like "cells" through the lens of a microscope:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The distances here between words paired in end rhymes, their mismatchings
in sound, structure, accent, lexical and grammatical meanings are
as exaggerated as in many of Moore's experiments, but no particular
attention is directed to the fact of their incompatibility. By contrast
with Moore's extravagantly imbalanced line lengths, the largely even
lineation of Gunn's couplets prevents the rhyme words from standing out
to be specially noticed. They are meant to be taken for granted.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Adding to this leveling effect, the rhyme pairs in this passage
are all without exception mismatched in their various ways as they
are, for instance, in poems of Wilfred Owen, whereas Moore included
instances of classical rhyming to call attention to the eccentricity
of her experiments. Here even before the "cells swimming in concert"
are disturbed in the second couplet-- "But look at / the intruder"--the
word "concert" is inharmoniously joined with "effort." Irregular rhymes
here are not "mutations"; they are the norm. Even "of":"love" is not
distinguished in its oddity from a near rhyme like "concert":"effort,"
the kind Eliot described as merely a deviation from the classical model
and not an overthrow of it. These differences in verbal treatment offer
concrete explanations of our differences in response to the same types
of anticlassical rhyming.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A more conceptual way of thinking about why we are not taken aback or
baffled by Gunn's rhyming, as we can be by Moore's, is suggested in Clive
Scott's statement that the rhyming practices of a culture or period can
be seen as "continually endorsing the intellectual and emotional stance
of an ideology."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
  What Moore's antitraditional rhymes express--that language and the
  phenomenal world coexist without intersecting, as 
  
<B></B>


parallels that
  never meet--has by now become so deeply embedded in the ideology of
  our culture and time that it is not held up to be questioned; Gunn's
  rhymes no longer need to proselytize about these issues.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why, then, can we still be surprised and uneasily amused by Moore's rhymes
built on the model of <I>love</I>:<I>of</I>? Besides the fact that they
use every imaginable verbal means to startle, bemuse, and amuse their
readers by their eccentric behavior, they are aided by circumstances of
history and habit. Most readers of poetry even now are more familiar with,
and therefore more at ease with, poems written over some four hundred and
fifty years of traditional rhyming than with modernist and more recent
poetry. According to Wilbur, "most poets who choose to rhyme, nowadays,
are troubled about using easy rhymes and are embarrassed about using
their own rhymes more than once."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
  Readers are more likely to be troubled by unfamiliar, anticlassical
  rhymes when they call attention to their departures from tradition.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Or to describe differently the roles of habit and history in shaping
our responses to Moore's iconoclastic rhymes: our ideology is not
easily compatible with what Marie Borroff described as our "naive or
commonsensical account of the conceptual implications of our inherited
parts-of-speech system."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
  The grammatical distinction between words in the separate and
  traditionally unequal classes that <I>love</I> and <I>of</I> belong to
  still has shaping power over our workaday understanding of language
  in relation to the things of this world. We still have an immediate,
  unexamined sense that the descriptive content of <I>pear</I> connects
  it with a piece of fruit, making it possible for us to conceive of them
  in relation to one another, which is what traditional rhyme teaches
  us to do. Whereas <I>a</I> is inherently empty of reference; in our
  hierarchical system of grammatical classes it could not legitimately
  be used in a rhyme with <I>pear,</I> which Marianne Moore vehemently
  insisted on doing, and Gunn might be quite likely to do without our
  noticing. It is tempting, but probably irresponsible, to think that
  this gap between our responses still shaped by inherited common sense
  notions and our contemporary ideology is implicitly acknowledged in
  Gunn's line, "There is coupling where no such should be."

combinations of rhyme words from those of Chaucer, which belonged to a
much earlier phase of English not yet fully emerged from inflectional
grammar. Wimsatt's example of Chaucerian rhyming is a sequence from
the Knight's portrait: "he," "worthynesse," "ded," "wildernesse,"
"kyndenesse," where the <I>esse</I> endings are close to what Aristotle
called <I>homoeoteleuton</I> (identical or similar inflectional case
endings). In contrast, Wimsatt characterized Pope's rhyme pairs as more
widely differing in parts of speech or in function of the same parts
of speech, in lexical meaning, and in syllabic structure, differences
heightened by the reliance of Pope's couplets on parallel structure and
epigrammatic point.
