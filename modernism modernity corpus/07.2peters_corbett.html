The French tradition beginning with Baudelaire's writings on art and
the work of Manet has seemed to generations of scholars to be the most
compelling modernist work there is. In the earliest historiography of
modern painting this art was conceived as possessing an inherent drive
towards abstraction, the full realization of which was understood to occur
only with the passing of the modernist baton to New York in 1945. The
dominant concern of modernist art was said to be the pursuit of a pure
painting, a preoccupation with pigment and the surface of the canvas, and
a consequent denigration of the importance of subject matter. Associated
above all with Clement Greenberg and Alfred Barr, this style of thinking
has been widely criticized from the 1970s onwards and largely replaced by
an alternative reading which privileges engagement with social modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Stemming from the thought of Walter Benjamin, a very specific reading of
 Baudelaire, and, most immediately, from the popularity of T. J. Clark's
 powerful analysis of Impressionism in <I>The Painting of Modern Life</I>,
 this approach defines a modernism in painting that is engaged with the
 society of the spectacle and the social consequences of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However different these accounts may be, they share a fascination with
the art and thought of France as central to the project of understanding
modernism, and hence provide a norm upon which any definitions must
explicitly or implicitly be built.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 One consequence of such a situation is historiographical hesitancy

<B></B>

about the status of modern visual art made in other places and under other
circumstances. In the case of English art, the evident differences from
French norms have obscured the possibility of evaluating the modernity
of work produced from the mid-nineteenth century onwards.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 With very few exceptions, such as that of Vorticism around 1914 or the
 revivified continental abstractionism of Ben Nicholson in the 1930s,
 English art has seemed continually at odds with ideas of modernism
 derived from France, whether it is conceived as abstraction or as
 socially responsive. An artist like Walter Sickert (1860-1942)
 is problematic in this way. Evidently occupied with the subjects of
 modern life, he is also committed to exploring the idea of a purely
 formal painting. But in neither aspect is he readily imaginable within
 French norms except through interpretative violence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of the modernity of late nineteenth century English art
has only recently begun to receive attention. Debate has focused around
two issues: the possibility of understanding the ways in which the art
produced in England in these years responded to cultural modernity in
Britain; and how far it can be related to modernist art made elsewhere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 These questions open up the possibility of reading the modernism of an
 artist like Sickert within the historical circumstances and concerns
 which formed his art. But Sickert's modernity continues to be judged by
 the degree to which he can be brought within the definitions of French
 modernism. In 1970 Wendy Baron concentrated on Sickert's interest
 in formal matters and argued that his work can be understood as the
 accommodation of a succession of French styles via Manet, Whistler,
 and Impressionism to an earlier, "pre-Impressionist" French tradition
 which she characterized as "the climax of Sickert's history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 More recently art historians have begun to explicate Sickert's art by
 adapting the concerns which the social history of art finds in French
 modernism. Anna Gruetzner Robins, the foremost commentator in this
 vein, has suggested that we must understand Sickert as a fl&acirc;neur,
 integrating him into an interpretation of "modernist strategies and
 modern life" which derives from the preoccupations of current readings
 of French experience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These commentators seem to share a certainty that the developments
to be found in France are ineluctably prior to any which could have
taken place in England. If Sickert's modernism is taken to lie in his
technical practice, and yet he seems to have rejected the procedures of
Impressionism, then it is inevitable that he found the "method . . . which
he considered to be ideal" in another version of French painting, even if
this time "of pre-Impressionist origin." If the interest is in the social
modernity of his subject matter, then it seems equally inevitable that we
should turn to powerful concepts such as the spectacle, the fl&acirc;neur,
and ideas of urban leisure evolved in scholarship on the social history of
French modernism, to better understand Sickert's work. Yet it is no more
clear that we can use definitions of cultural modernity predicated upon
French history to improve our grasp of English art than that we should
refer any technical innovations to French models. The circumstances of
French and English modernity are distinct and modes of representation
in the two countries are culturally specific. To translate terms and
concepts evolved to account for one type of art to describe work produced
elsewhere is to court misreading.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay I pursue a rather different argument. Taking the example of
the important music hall scenes he produced from the late 1880s onwards,
I suggest that we can discern in Sickert's work a critique of the capacity
of painting to comprehend modern experience, even as he deploys it himself
in an effort to do so. Sickert inherits from this two mentors, Whistler
and Degas, contrasting approaches to the representation of modernity,
broadly equivalent to the formalist and the social definitions I have
discussed. Both are present in his work. But their passage through English
culture in the form of Symbolist and Realist modes of painting, makes
them available to Sickert in ways that proved conducive to critique. By
looking closely at the music hall paintings we can observe both his
attempts to enact the modernist imperative to define and understand
modern life and his articulation of the difficulty of attempting to do
so through what he called the "grossly material" substance of paint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 In the process he both asserts and questions the fascination of modernist
 painting with pure visuality and with the subject matter of modernity. I
 will argue that this dialectic is formed within the specificity of
 English modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sickert's music hall paintings fall into several distinct chronological
periods.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 They first appear in his oeuvre around 1887, and Sickert produced
 some of his most important paintings and graphic works of the London
 halls in the years up to 1889. This first period includes the sequence
 of paintings which I shall discuss below, in which mirrors play an
 important compositional role. Returning to this theme between 1894 and
 1898, Sickert produced a number of studies concentrating mostly on the
 Bedford Music Hall in Camden Town. The majority of these paintings take
 as their subject various descriptions of the audience. This phase of
 his work seems to have been brought to a close when Sickert departed
 for Dieppe at the end of 1898. He was based abroad for seven years and
 returned to London to live and work during 1905, a move which may have
 inspired his next sequence of music hall subjects. In 1906-1907,
 starting with <I>Noctes Ambrosianae</I> (1906, Nottingham Museum and
 Art Gallery), Sickert produced studies of the audiences seen in halls
 in London and Paris. After this, and with very few exceptions, Sickert
 abandoned themes related to the halls.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The early music hall scenes have been identified with Sickert's transfer
of loyalties from Whistler to Degas during the 1880s. Their importance
in this way is indicated by Wendy Baron, who ascribes to them Sickert's
main influence from the French tradition concerned with content rather
than technique. According to Baron:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
In spite of Sickert's denial of any French influence behind his early
music-hall paintings their compositional arrangements were certainly
derived from Degas's theater and ballet pictures; moreover, Degas's
<I>caf&eacute;s-concerts</I>, with their harsh lighting and robustly
characterized <I>chanteuses</I> must have contributed towards Sickert's
initial inspiration to tackle their nearest English equivalent, the
cockney music-hall.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<B></B>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
She goes on to account for this influence in formal terms of
composition and technical procedure. More recently, T. J. Clark in
<I>The Painting of Modern Life</I> devotes some close examination
to the caf&eacute;s-concerts and the attention Degas paid them in
the 1870s. Clark sees the commodified leisure of the urban Parisians
as a fertile soil for the complexities of definition and enactment
of the new class identities modernity brought in its wake. Clark's
caf&eacute;-concert "<I>produced</I> the popular" as a sounding board
against which the uncertainties of class could be made to resonate and
which it "mitigated . . . by making a spectacle of them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 For at least some of its audience, Clark argues, "it seems . . . that
 the masquerade [of the performance] confirmed their sense of the
 class as pure contingency, a matter of endless shifting and exchange,
 for society was pictured in the caf&eacute;-concert as a series of
 petty transformation scenes, in which everyone suffered the popular
 sea-change'.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 In responding to these strange circumstances, Degas's paintings give
 an image to this sense that the audience "<I>were</I> the illusion
 (<I>Painting of Modern Life</I>, 224)."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Intriguingly, in making this argument Clark feels the need, virtually for
the only time in his writings, to draw a standard of comparison from the
circumstances of English modernity. He cites T. S. Eliot's 1923 obituary
essay on the music hall artist Marie Lloyd. Clark quotes at length and
it will be worth following what holds his attention so strongly. Eliot
observes in his text that Lloyd had in her time "far the strongest hold
on popular affection" and attributes this to "her understanding of the
people and sympathy with them, and the people's recognition of the fact
that she embodied the virtues which they genuinely most respected in
private life." Eliot concludes:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I have called her the expressive re of the lower classes. There is
no such expressive re for any other class. The middle classes have
no such idol: the middle classes are morally corrupt. That is to say,
their own life fails to find a Marie Lloyd to express it; nor have they
any independent virtues which might give them as a conscious class any
dignity. (<I>Painting of Modern Life</I>, 216-17)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is, in other words, an argument about the representation of bourgeois
modernity in English culture. In some way which neither Eliot nor Clark
explore, the difficulties of evolving a set of languages through which
modernity of experience could be represented is rooted, or perhaps
especially telling, in the English experience. Clark returns to Eliot's
claim to clinch his own argument.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
To put Eliot's verdict in a more limited form: the middle class in the
later nineteenth century, and even the early years of the twentieth,
had not yet invented an <I>imaginary</I> of its own fate . . . for the
time being it was obliged to feed on the values and idioms of those
classes it wished to dominate; and doing so involved it in making the
idioms part of a further system, in which the popular was expropriated
from those who produced it--made over into a separate realm of images
which were given back, duly refurbished, to the "people" thus safely
defined. (<I>Painting of Modern Life</I>, 229-230)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a result, Cark says, "the material called popular" was hotly contested,
needing to be "continually renewed and recast, lest its working-class
users find ways of giving it back

<B></B>

its original consistency--making it assume, for example, the form called
proletarian" (<I>Painting of Modern Life</I>, 230).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One might well argue that Sickert's music hall scenes are
indices of the same modern processes that Clark discerns in the
caf&eacute;s-concerts. Sickert's colonization of the popular forms of the
music hall, his forceful use of the bodies of working-class models and the
gestures of working-class entertainment as markers of modern experience,
might seem to amount to the same thing as Clark's caf&eacute;s-concerts,
the capture of powerful representations of modernity as a means of
cloaking the nakedness of the bourgeois imaginary. It's a good argument,
and I can readily imagine someone giving it an outing on Sickert's music
hall pictures. But I want instead to suggest that the meanings Sickert
took from Degas would not be adequately described by this reading. Degas,
for Sickert, is part of a complex of possible relations to modernity
which are best described as deriving from the patterns of reception of
continental influences in England. They are bound up with the ways in
which Symbolism and Realism as alternative and competing descriptions
of modernity were alive for Sickert--not least within the process of
the compositions of his paintings; and not least when they were named
respectively Whistler and Degas--and the ways in which they were worked
through as part of the interest in making painting a practice suited to
the representation and investigation of modern life within specifically
British conditions and circumstances. To clarify this I need to say
something about how these relations were defined by the time that Sickert
began his music hall sequences in the 1880s, and particularly about the
role of Symbolism in that unfolding process.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1889 Sickert wrote an introduction to the  catalogue of the "London
Impressionists" show at the Goupil Gallery in which he showed several
music hall pictures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 What Sickert said there has had a bad press from art historians, who
 have seen it as an instance of bad faith or a deliberate attempt to
 throw the readers off the scent of his relationship with continental
 Impressionism. The problem is that Sickert writes about a collection of
 paintings which have a shared aim to depict the contemporary scene as
 if they were perpetuating the protocols and concerns of Symbolism. In
 the catalogue he defined Impressionism like this:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Essentially and firstly it is not realism. It has no wish to record
anything merely because it exists . . . It accepts, as the aim of the
picture, what Edgar Allen Poe asserts to be the sole legitimate province
of the poem, beauty. It is . . . strong in the belief that for those who
live in the most wonderful city in the world, the most fruitful course
of study lies in the persistent effort to render the magic and poetry
which they daily see around them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This has often seemed disconcerting to later readers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Sickert's justification for the subject matter of the show is not social
 realism or "the painting of modern life." Instead, he couches his work
 in the language of symbolism by using the terms "beauty,"

<B></B>

"magic" and "poetry." And by evoking Poe he calls upon one of the
arch-symbolists of the English-language tradition. How are we then to
reconcile this artist's own account of his work with the ambitions which
seem to be embodied in works shown at the Goupil, such as Sidney Starr's
<I>The City Atlas</I> (1889, National Gallery of Canada) or Sickert's own
<I>The Butcher's Shop</I> (1884, York City Art Gallery), let alone with
his music hall paintings? The catalogue introduction seems to suggest a
different and inappropriate principle of meaning for images which strike
us as plainly about social realism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It would be a mistake to place too much interpretative weight on Sickert's
introduction. Nevertheless, I think that we can largely accept what
he says here. The fact is that it is possible to read this strand of
British Impressionism as profoundly aware of the ambitions of Symbolism
and influenced by them in its project to represent the modern city.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 These paintings have a central concern with describing the realities
 of experience as they obtained within the modernized environment of
 London's new boundaries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The modern city is presented as a legitimate slice of reality on which
 to expend the analytical and registering powers of painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The perception of the London Impressionists show as centrally concerned
 with the requirements of this recording is accurate enough. But it is
 also the "magic and poetry" and the "beauty" of this material which is
 to be evoked and these are Symbolist ambitions, that Wendy Baron quite
 rightly refers directly to Whistler's <I>Ten O'Clock Lecture</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The last decades of the nineteenth century, those in which Symbolism
was emerging within the fluid relationships of the British art world,
saw the beginning of an unprecedented modernization of the conditions of
artistic production which continued into the twentieth century. Rapidly
changing, requiring ever-greater professionalization from practitioners,
this modernizing process enforced the commodification of the work and
the transformation of art practice into capitalist production which
is so marked a feature of British experience--as of French--from the
Pre-Raphaelites to Vorticism and beyond.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Under these circumstances the most urgent impulses of British art
were those which derived from the experience of modernity. The common
preoccupations were not only about the evolution of new modes and idioms
of visual enquiry, but also about what needed to be enquired into, whether
modern life or some promise of alternative value. What emerged was in part
a new definition of practice which emphasized the function of the work of
art as revelation. Capital's professionalized publicity machines and the
strutting artist-entrepreneurs, of whom Whistler, "his pockets bulging
with newspaper articles" is only the most obvious example, often made
art out of a belief in its capacity to transcend this lived modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 The values of art were understood to be those which the materialism of
 contemporary life had put aside. It was to be prized for its access to
 concealed, but fundamental, truths, to a reality which the frenetic,
 mobile, surface of modernity merely disguised. Modern life was something
 which it was the task of the artist to endure, overcome and discard in
 order to reveal the truths beneath.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the formation of this set of concepts, the induction of French
<I>Symbolisme</I> into Britain, through channels such as Charles
Ricketts's periodical of the 1880s and 1890s, <I>The Dial</I>, and
Whistler's close relationship to Mallarm&eacute; and his circle, plays
an important role.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Coming out of the pressures of modernity in the late nineteenth century
 on the art world, British Symbolism's central concern was the search
 for a representation which would access those aspects of experience
 and reality which the dominant materialism of industrial capitalism was
 felt to elide or cover over. Its most urgent desires were those which
 aim to strip away the veil of matter and to suggest or evoke something
 of greater truth beneath.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This did not mean that such art abandoned an interest in modern
experience. Far from it. Whistler's nocturnes have been cited as "central
statements of the Symbolist position" because of their artificiality
and frank distance from reality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 A painting like <I>Nocturne: Blue and Silver--Chelsea</I> (1871, Tate
 Gallery) elides the contemporary elements of the scene in favor of a
 painterly self-sufficiency and the evocation of what Whistler called
 "poetry" and "palaces in the night."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless <I>Blue and Silver</I> remains a contemporary scene,
 recognizable as a view across the Thames towards Chelsea. The motif it
 depicts is an industrial, quintessentially modern one.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 In a parallel way, the work of G. F. Watts exemplifies modes of Victorian
 painting that repudiate the claims of Realism, yet he conceived it as
 offering a direct relation to contemporary experience. In <I>Mammon:
 Dedicated to his Worshippers</I> (1884-1885, Tate Gallery),
 Watts depicts modern society's self-destructive embrace of idea that
 "prosperity has become our real god."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 His re of Death pressing remorselessly across the threshold of
 a Victorian household in <I>Love and Death</I> (c. 1874-1877,
 Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester) likewise aims to bring questions about
 the meaning of existence forcefully into Watts's contemporary world.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These paintings derive from a concern with the character of modern
experience, but deal with it by attempting to find principles through
which a more authentic meaning, a deeper truth, can be brought to
bear. Symbolism seeks a representation which will access those aspects of
existence and reality which it believes the dominant materialism of its
culture covers over. Modernity's surface, an account of its appearance
and optical character, is repudiated in favor of the 'beauty' which
may be found within it. But this act of revelation remains a way of
responding to the contemporary: Watts's symbols of terror and sterility
and Whistler's transformation of the London scene are equally ways of
attributing significance to the contemporary themes and sites from which
they begin. Symbolist representation in this sense is committed to an
analysis and understanding of modern experience, but distrusts a surface
account of the visual world as a means of achieving it. Symbolism proposes
a deeper investigation and revelation of the conditions of experience
than the surface can provide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The advent of an art explicitly concerned with contemporary life and
subjects in Britain is in part the result of a shift from this Symbolist
ambition to make sense of the

<B></B>

contemporary world by uncovering abstract or generalized truths which
can substitute for it to an ambition to comprehend the modern on its
own terms. In the history of that ambition artists like Sickert were
also the heirs to a mode of painting opposed to Symbolism, one which
attempted to transcribe and understand the character of modern life
precisely by cultivating an art of the surface. For, by the end of
the century, not only was there a wing of British painting composed
of Aesthetes, Decadents, Pre-Raphaelites and others--artists concerned
with the inherent or essential meaning of experience and hence loosely
'Symbolist'--but there was also a broad spectrum of 'Realist' painters
whose aim it was to describe the appearance of the world in their art,
whether as plein-air painters, Impressionists or naturalists. Whereas
Symbolist practice understands the character of modern life by searching
for its essential 'beauty' beneath the surface, Realist practice in
all its variety pins down experience by replaying its visual, often its
optical, appearance rather than by attempting to conjure its essence. In
other words, Realist attention is directed towards an account of the
forms and surfaces of the world, painting modern life through the kind
of description the analysis of appearance could offer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both Realists and Symbolists are divisible into a multitude of sub-groups,
and many artists have characteristics that belong to apparently opposing
camps, so that these options are in fact best understood as points on
a continuous range of possibilities. Individual artists frequently had
connections to both ends of the spectrum, and many produced work which
is best understood as bringing together apparently opposed ambitions
and strategies. Both were of crucial importance for the development of
Sickert's account of modern experience in his art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Leading 'London Impressionists' exhibitors in 1889 like Philip Wilson
 Steer accordingly show a pattern of movement between the recording
 of surface and this delving for universal truth. <I>Girls Running,
 Walberswick Pier</I> (c. 1889-1894, Tate Gallery) or <I>A Summer's
 Evening</I> (c. 1887-1888, private collection) combine in their
 fabric the dual inheritance of Symbolism and Realism. <I>A Summer's
 Evening</I> yokes an overt reference to the universalized Symbolism of
 Puvis de Chavannes to experimental paint marks which push forward the
 plein-air and recording ambitions of much English Impressionism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Steer's most interesting works are hybrid, combining the ambitions
 of Impressionism to transcribe and register the surface realities of
 the world with the Symbolists' aspirations to universalized truths
 to produce an art which aims to uncover and reveal the realities of
 modern experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Steer, Sickert's explicit interest in revealing modernity's character
by uncovering the surface to lay bare the essential realities, was deeply
indebted to the ambitions of Symbolism to uncover the hidden truths of
experience. But, also like Steer, his attention to the surface character
of that life as a sign of its authenticity and nature were indebted to
Realism. The apparent ambiguity in Sickert's artistic loyalties was the
occasion of a great deal of comment in the art press.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Sickert's critics see in his work an example of modernity in English
 painting because they recognize a very modern kind of puzzle, a great
 technical ability and sophistication put at the service of what seems
 to them to be unequivocally sordid and ugly subject matter. On the one
 hand, Sickert is for his critics the proponent of an "extremist Realism,"
 a recorder of the

<B></B>

surface of reality, whose "eye is a purely mechanical contrivance for
conveying images" which "seems to strip his subjects of all the[ir]
<I>aura</I>."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, he is a painter who "like Mallarm&eacute; . . . gives
 you a fragment here and a fragment there, enough to prove the reality
 of his vision, but not enough to render it visible to the world,"
 or who shows "how . . . a subject may be beautified by the touch of

<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 These critics understand that Sickert has a visual project, sustained
 over a number of years and a great many works, but they can only
 understand the content of his paintings as evidence of a perplexing
 desire to be 'modern' at all costs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 These uncertainties are, I think, about the ways in which continental
 influences coming into Britain are to be understood as affecting art
 practice via their intersection with domestic traditions rather than as
 if they were straightforwardly transferrable as defining concepts from
 Paris to London. Symbolism and Realism were for Sickert vital players
 and signs in the ambition to paint the modern world he encountered. But
 their roles within that arena were ones defined by the complexities of
 the indigenous histories which absorbed French and other continental
 influences and remade them into forms which reflected domestic concerns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Sickert's case, this dual investment in the aims of Symbolism and
Realism gives rise to a further possibility. Sickert understood the
Symbolist painter and the Realist painter as sharing a similar goal:
both attempt to understand the world through the agency of the visual,
though they each interpret the character of this world in different
ways. Ideas of the visual seemed to underlie both the optical realism
of Impressionist practices and the investigation of hidden meaning which
would support the project of Symbolist artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The visual is imagined as describing both the world as surface, as
 appearance, as what optically registers as its characteristics and
 organization; and the visionary, the province of the seers and prophets
 so beloved of Symbolism: that which lies beneath the surface and in
 which reality inheres. The visual bounces back from the surface, and
 it penetrates into the depths. Contemporaries understood the visual as
 recording the reality of experience because it registers what is really
 there; and as recording the reality of experience because seeing beyond
 what appears on the surface into the depths of meaning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The surface thus became a site of contestation between the Symbolist
and Realist modes of representation. The visual seemed to treat the
surface as the only authentic account of the world, but also contends
that perceptions <I>beneath</I> the surface were what counted in the
representation of reality. The possibility accordingly arose for these
artists that paint, the substance of the visual itself, could accurately
register surface reality or uncover the depths of meaning in a revelatory
transcription of essence onto the surface of the canvas. At a moment
when the authority of language to register the world was increasingly
in doubt, the promise of an unmediated access to reality through the
visual media of paint and its graphic analogues became truly attractive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 But to say this is already to raise the principal difficulty, for paint
 is unquestionably material, a densely physical medium which inserts
 its own creation of the world into the ideal space of an unmediated
 presentation of reality.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This nature of paint allows it to match the opposition of Symbolism
and Realism, depth and surface, with a third set of terms and to act,
for Sickert, as a critical tool in opening up the implications of the
modes of representation promulgated in Symbolism and Realism. Sickert
does this by problematizing the signs which paint offers as a route to
comprehension of the world. On the one hand, there is a neat sequence of
connections to be posited which runs from the real via the visible forms
and surfaces of the world to the surface of the painting which embodies
the visual transcription of those forms and surfaces. On the other,
there is the surface of the painting itself, a surface which intrudes
into the fantasy of an unmediated transcription of reality, a blatantly
fictional skin of paint or cluster of marks which constantly threatens
to reduce itself to its own materiality and consequently to yield up
its presumptive rights to <I>be</I> the world which it describes. The
interplay between fictionality and reality which the painted surface
enacts allows the contest between a form of understanding which wishes
to see truth in the visible forms and surfaces of the world and one
which wishes to see truth only in what is <I>in</I>visible, beneath or
behind those forms and surfaces, to be articulated and explored within
the physical and material constitution of paintings themselves.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Themes of the visual--looking, transcription, the exigencies of the medium
of paint or some other graphic process--are all important in Sickert's
art because they strive to articulate these issues within the works.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The visual seems to Sickert to be both the necessary medium of
 understanding and one which, by the very fact of its materiality,
 is compromised because it carries inherent difficulties of analysis
 within it. This gives rise to a critical project within Sickert's
 oeuvre, one which deploys the diagnostic possibilities of the visual
 to understand and determine the realities of contemporary experience
 while self-reflexively attempting to understand the limitations and
 range of those possibilities. These preoccupations are discernable in
 the thematization of the visual and the act of looking which occurs in
 Sickert's music hall works. It is not just "poetry and magic" which
 are derived in these works, the deep meaning of the modern, but also
 the adequacy of the visual as a tool for uncovering that meaning. In
 effect Sickert's use of the "grossly material" medium of paint tests the
 adequacy of painting as an investigative instrument for the apprehension
 of the realities of modern experience.

The music hall paintings use the scenes of contemporary entertainment in
the halls to stand for the character and meaning of the modern. Sickert
seems to have felt that the authenticity and reality of modern experience
that he wished to reveal to his audience could best be suggested in
the rough and tumble music halls that were mainly located in outlying
London districts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Sickert sets the dialectic between essence and surface in motion
 by drawing attention to the theatricality and the falsity of the
 stage as a surface in his depiction of his music hall scenes. The
 ramifying visual complexities and nested images of paintings
 like <I>Little Dot Hetherington at the Bedford Music Hall</I> (<A
 HREF="7.2peters_corbett_1.html"> 1</A>) or <I>Vesta Victoria at
 the Old Bedford</I> (<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_2.html"> 2</A>),
 are Sickert's meditations on this

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 296]</B>

dialectic between the representation of the material surface of experience
and what lies beneath them. In <I>Vesta Victoria</I> and <I>Little Dot
Hetherington</I>, space is misleading: what we initially take to be the
stage is revealed to be a reflection, and the direction of the singer's
gestures have to be painfully reconstructed from reversed information.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 The first experience of encountering an image like <I>Vesta Victoria</I>
 is often puzzling. What is being depicted here? And what can we make of
 the relationships between its parts? The eye persistently attempts to
 read the left-hand side of the picture as a hollow space that allows us
 to see into the hemisphere of the box. But the presence of the audience
 in the gallery above therefore becomes inexplicable, a problem compounded
 by Sickert's abstraction and flattening of the vertical divider between
 the audience and the stage which here seems flush with the picture
 plane and parallel to it. Lower down, Sickert offsets the increasing
 clarity of this vertical element by juxtaposing it with an incoherent
 passage composed of fields of near-formless color. It is only when we
 reach the very bottom of the canvas that the vertical element fully
 crystallizes into the beaded frame of the mirror, at which point the
 spatial complexities of the painting at last become clear. In short,
 Sickert contrasts represented space with the flatness of the picture
 surface in order to confuse our perceptions of the events he depicts.

Recession, too, challenges our understanding.  In <I>The Sisters Lloyd</I>
(c. 1888-89, Government Art Collection), or <I>Little Dot</I>, our
perception of the backdrop has to be laboriously wrestled clear of the
perspective space. We are reminded that we cannot trust the surfaces of
appearance because of the inherent theatricality, and hence unreality,
of the performance depicted. Sickert also uses mirrors, backdrops and
other theatrical devices to draw our attention to the instability of
representation and appearance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 <I>The P. S. Wings in the O. P. Mirror</I> shows the performer in
 the off-prompt mirror reflected behind the watching audience, whose
 fascinated attention to the stage therefore appears to us at first
 misdirected (<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_3.html"> 3</A>). We see
 the act of vision, of looking, of surrendered self-consciousness, as well
 as the performance which attracts it, but now the two are disjunctive
 and ill-matched. Appearance, analysis and display, the movements of
 the surface and of its meaning, come to us through Sickert's painting,
 confused and in an alienated relationship to each other. It is as if
 the lines of relationship which connect appearance with the meaning of
 events are disrupted and difficult to access. Surface is revealed as
 inadequate and deceptive. "Poetry and magic" arise from the gap between
 the surface appearance, the act of looking, and the reality of what is
 seen, as they are imaged in the commercial halls where the essence of
 modern experience is performed through the surface of entertainment.

This might be regarded as stage one of Sickert's argument in paint. In
paintings such as <I>Gatti's Hungerford Palace of Varieties: Second Turn
of Katie Lawrence</I>, Sickert advances his argument further through the
extended use of facture and depicted space to problematize visual meaning
(<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_4.html"> 4</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 In <I>Gatti's</I>, Katie Lawrence is standing full square in front of
 a backdrop curtain which has an elaborate architectural space painted
 on it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 There is none of the overt spatial obscurity which dominates <I>Vesta
 Victoria</I>. Having set himself the challenge that this poses, Sickert
 manipulates perception and

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 298]</B>

space, surface and depth by exploiting the ambiguities that the backdrop
curtain suggests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 As in <I>Little Dot</I> and <I>The Sisters Lloyd</I>, the <I>tromp
 l'oeil</I> effect of the backdrop confuses us.  It is difficult to
 decide whether what we are looking at is intended to represent real or
 painted depth. The backdrop is depicted in such a way that the areas
 between the columns at the 'sides' are to be imagined as mirrors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 On the right, the distinction between the backdrop and the 'real'
 space is defined by the curtain (although this is only a darker maroon
 compared to the lighter maroon, plum and dark pink dominant in much
 of the backdrop, a similarity which itself suggests more confusion or
 blending of real and fictional spaces, perhaps even a confusion of
 identity). Although the pelmet of the curtain is visible across the
 whole of the top of the picture, it is much harder to make out what
 is happening on the left hand side. The backdrop appears to extend
 beyond the edge of the canvas, but this does not make visual sense as
 it becomes vertiginously difficult to disentangle real from fictional
 space. The thin strip of light color at the bottom of the backdrop
 marking the gap between it and the floor does not extend beyond the
 hats of the audience at the far left, so the final section lacks this
 key marker of difference. Immediately above the space on the left where
 this gap would be is a strictly illegible patch of paint in light and
 dark tan colors which has been simply scrubbed onto the surface of
 the canvas. This patch is strategically placed to allow the design of
 the backdrop to appear to be real space and to emphasize the effect of
 the perspective recession painted onto it. With this arrangement, it
 is almost impossible to read this left hand section of the backdrop as
 flat. Only the hint of the swag of the curtain at top left allows us, if
 we notice it, to key in the proper relationships of depth and reality. At
 the far right, above the round plate-shaped hat of the watching woman,
 there is another similar area of illegibility.  Although it doesn't
 have the same deliberately disturbing effect as that on the left,
 this area also disrupts expectations of clearly differentiated space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sickert also used specialized painting techniques to extend this
confusion of reality and fictionality into other areas of the canvas. A
thin and watery application of yellow paint describing the low railings
across the front of the stage functions representatively rather than
mimetically. This application of yellow paint changes with the pressure
of the hand and the fullness of the brush. Such is the mark of this
medium: it cannot claim a direct transcription of the world but rather
asserts its physicality in constructing its account of the world. In a
similar spirit, some of the heads at bottom right of the painting are
outlined in a heavy black line. Sporadically across the surface (for
instance in the woman's hat and hair in the foreground) there are lines
of bright red paint which seem at first to be the remnants of lines
at right-angles to each other and resemble the painter's squaring up,
the network of gridlines used to accurately transfer the information
from preparatory drawings to the canvas. Some of the lines are tight
and appear to be ruled, others are blotted. This gives a random accent
to the surface which provides visual interest, but it is certain that
these grid lines were applied after the main stages of painting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 They are visible even where the main body of the paint is wet on wet,
 and it's clear that in some areas the red paint has been brushed dry
 over dried wet on wet paint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Again, the woman's hat was described using liquid

<B></B>

paint, and the thinly drawn red lines could only have been added
afterwards. Like the patches of illegibility which paint as a material
is allowed to describe at the two sides of the canvas, these dialectical
relationships of paint surface and descriptive technique function to
draw attention to the character of paint as a medium.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Paint in Sickert's music hall scenes is avowedly fictional, a
 medium of apprehension and understanding rather than a transparent
 transcription. It is precisely this fictionality, the metaphorical
 opacity of the medium, which is acknowledged through the literally
 opaque and declaratively material character of the paint itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These strategies draw attention to the paradoxes of the visual surfaces of
these scenes. A mere description of contemporary life will not do. Sickert
embarks upon an Impressionistic investigation that transcribes the
surface appearances of modern life, but he doesn't stop there. The
music hall becomes what W. J. T. Mitchell has called a "hypericon," or
an image that seeks to investigate "the act of picturing" or "imagine
the activity of imagination, re the practice of ration."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 The music hall serves as a workshop for Sickert's investigation of how
 painting renders meaning in relation to the desire for knowledge about
 the world. This investigation questions the access to reality which
 paint affords. By exploiting the paradoxes and ambiguities clustered
 within representations of the 'sordid' music halls of London, Sickert
 questions the feasibility of communicating a deep understanding of
 modernity in paint. The visual surface of the painted canvas is the
 tool he uses for this enquiry.

This relationship to the visual also accounts for the interest
so many of Sickert's music hall paintings and drawings take in the
audience. The various versions of <I>The Gallery of the Old Bedford</I>
(<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_5.html"> 5</A>) or the 1906-1909
series--which includes <I>Noctes Ambrosianae</I>, <I>The Old Middlesex</I>
(c. 1906-1907, The Beaverbrook Art Gallery,

<B></B>

Fredericton, New Brunswick), with its bird's-eye view down onto the
spectators in the stalls, and the <I>Gai&eacute;t&eacute; Montparnasse</I>
(c. 1907, private collection), which takes the opposite viewpoint,
sharply upwards from the stalls into the gallery--all dwell on the
watching audience. In these works the loss of the self in the act of
spectatorship signals a direct involvement with the world, the absence of
mediation which Realism claimed for itself. The rapture of the audience
as they watch, craning, leaning and gawping down, suggests a complete
self-identification and involvement of the spectator with the spectacle
via the transparent medium of transcription. But the observation of the
audience in these works also allows Sickert to question and explore the
adequacy of that account of visuality.

In one of the climatic paintings of the Camden Town period, <I>The
Studio: Painting of a Nude</I>, Sickert foregrounds visuality as a
thematic concern (<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_6.html"> 6</A>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 <I>The Studio</I> places the nude re which serves as the center of
 attention in the Camden Town series into a more complex spatial setting
 and introduces the explicit re of the painter observing his model
 in a mirror.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 The real and implied multiplication of images

<B></B>

of a passive nude re suggest that she functions solely as an object of
observation. The important action is the painter's translation of the nude
body into the medium of paint. Likewise, the rapture of spectatorship,
the loss and dissolution of the self in the parade of tawdry action on
the Music Hall stage can be brought back into the realm of comprehension
by the pressure of the analysis the painter brings to bear upon it. It
is the painter's vision which renders the nude and the audience, the
music hall and its performers, meaningful and exemplary of modernity and
reality. The music hall audience, like the nude, is itself the object of
observation in the painter's vision. The meaning of these events seems to
be that they <I>are</I> observed and therefore brought into the context
of knowledge. In both types of subject matter Sickert's painter's eye can
assess, discriminate, classify and analyze the shifting social practices
of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The audience of rapt watchers stands for a complete identification of
the spectator with the thing observed the imagined abolition of the
medium of representation. But it is also the opportunity for Sickert to
create a conceptual laboratory which will allowed him to investigate that
situation and hence to assess the position of the painter as well as of
paint. The painter sees not only the world but also those who look at it;
he sees not only reality but its watchers, too. This serves to assert
Sickert's claims for the authority of the painter as the finest example
of the visual and its power, the purest vision, and the purest instance
of visuality at work. But the fictionality of the music hall performance
reminds us that the revelations offered to us by the visual (and hence
the painter) are in fact inadequate.  Sickert's play with mirrors and
his insistence on the contested nature of visual knowledge in painting
increase this effect and draw our attention to it. Thus the audience is
the image of the direct engagement with the world that visuality claims
it can deliver, but the location of this example is within circumstances
which are clearly fictional. The audience's rapture is provoked not by
immediate reality but by theatrical performance, a fiction which deceives
them and their fascinated observation. Depth frustrates surface here. The
artist's observation of the self-deception of the audience gives Sickert
the space he needs to consider the limitations of the claims of the
visual. The artist as observer still retains some authority, but the
presence of the audience implies a critique of visuality that suggests
that the artist, too, is compromised.

The drawing Sickert made of the drop curtain at the Gai&eacute;t&eacute;,
Montparnasse sometime between 1906-1907 displays this compromise in
a summary form (<A HREF="7.2peters_corbett_7.html"> 7</A>). The
curtain is, first of all, a surface; its smooth fall obscures the
arrangement or rearrangement of objects and events behind it. The
curtain here represents the flat surface of the canvas or paper. Like
those surfaces, it is marked and scored with a multiplicity of visual
and verbal signs. These signs are both representational in the sense
that they function as drawings and icons of the advertisements and
conventional in the sense that they are linear elements which divide
the screen into boxes and hence into discrete commercial spaces. But
the marks that describe the curtain and the signs for which it is the
material vehicle are identical to those that describe the surrounding
spaces in the drawing. This suggests that the semiotics of modernity
implied in this re of the curtain cannot be separated from the social
space where these meanings

<B></B>

are realized. Despite this paradox, Sickert's attention is firmly focused
on the curtain itself and the messages it flashes out at the audience
beneath it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here, Sickert thematizes the surface as a subject in its own right. In
Camden Town period paintings such as <I>The Studio: Painting of a
Nude</I>, the surface represents the imposition of meaning on the world by
the controlling mark of the painter's hand. Even the nugatory or trivial
can be become meaningful once a particular quality of attention is paid
to it by the central self of the painter who wields the brush or pencil
as an instrument of knowledge about and definition of the world. Sickert
used painting techniques to draw our attention to the overt presence of
the materiality of the paintwork such that the surface itself functions
as a sign of his authorial knowledge. The surface is the site where
that process of definition takes place. And here we have a surface on
which particular sorts of modern meaning are frankly declared. What is
thematized is therefore the process or fact of surface as meaning. The
sort of meaning it offers is, of course, another matter. The modernity
of the advertisements makes them also the <I>subject</I> of Sickert's
attention. They are what he understands and renders comprehensible
through the practice of his art. By the process of drawing them, the
advertisements become known, are brought into the orbit of comprehension,
but they also <I>become</I> that process. Their superficiality (in the
literal sense), flatness, reduction of the signs of meaning to a few
gestural formulations, suggests the problems attendant

<B></B>

on knowing the world through representation. What is happening here is
that Sickert's own practice, his own use of surface and materiality
to render modern life in a form of knowledge, is seen as inadequate,
as a reduction of the fullness of the world into a flattened surface,
into <I>representation</I>. What presents itself as informational, as
knowledge or as reportage about the world is revealed as discourse, as
invested or interested. The view of reality which the surface encapsulates
and promotes is a partial rather than a full account. It is compromised
and bound into the systems it seeks to explicate.

I have taken a rather different view of Sickert's music hall scenes than
that one might derive from a reading dependent on either the formalist or
the social-historical readings of modernism. In particular, I have argued
that Sickert's work at this period resists the charge one might muster
from a reading of Clark via Eliot. This work, in fact, is precisely
about the representation of English bourgeois modernity which Eliot
notes as the central issue in his discussion of Marie Lloyd. Clark sees
French depictions of the caf&eacute;s-concerts as involved in the lack
of 'an <I>imagery</I>' adequate to the representation of middle-class
experience. Sickert's work depends on a similar problematic absence of
representation and the concomitant need to bring it into existence to
clarify and describe the experience of modernity. But if Sickert attempts
to make use of the forms of working-class entertainment to image and
assuage a middle-class homelessness in modernity, then he also subjects
that project to critical attention. In undertaking this critical project,
Sickert makes use of paint, the visual itself as the principal means of
inquiry and criticism. I am not suggesting that this is better or worse
than the monuments of French modernism, simply different. In other words,
if we want to progress in the ambition to revise our understanding of
modernities outside the French experience then we need to tackle them
from within.

Sickert made the argument for realism in art in a chapter, "Modern
Realism in Painting" he contributed to Andr&eacute; Theuriet, <I>Jules
Bastien-Lepage and his Art: A Memoir</I> (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1892),
133-43; Sickert wrote there that "the important fact about Millet
is not that he struggled with poverty, or that he expressed on canvas
the dignity of labour, but that he was a great artist" and was able "to
render" his motifs "in fitting terms in accordance with the tradition
which governs the use of each material," (133, 134).

Two of the most sophisticated and developed attempts to do so, work
by defining Sickert as a wholly realist painter, unresponsive to the
mediating function of the painter; see Robert Ross, "The Stafford
Gallery: Paintings by Mr Walter Sickert," <I>Morning Post</I> (19 July
1911), and Roger Fry, "Mr Walter Sickert's Pictures at the Stafford
Gallery," <I>Nation</I> (8 July 1911), both of which were provoked by
a successful one-man show. For Fry, Sickert's "vision is curiously
detached . . . . Things for him have only their visual values, they
are not symbols, they contain no key to unlock the secrets of the heart
and spirit." For Ross, Sickert's subjects "must . . . satisfy a severe
aesthetic formula which admits nothing so artificial as poetry, nothing
so obvious as physical beauty, to disturb the functions of paint." The
point for both critics, is that Sickert is a creature of the visual only
and that his subject matter is accordingly inconsequential for him.

In a short essay on "Sickert's late work" in <I>Late Sickert</I>,
exhib. cat. (London: Arts Council, 1981), Helen Lessore described the
ways in which "one of the most striking characteristics of Sickert's
late pictures is the consistent treatment of the canvas as a surface,
with an all-over equality of tension between the flat shapes into which
it is divided, irrespective of what they represent" . She adduces
<I>Temple Bar</I> (c. 1941, private collection), which has some claim
to be the last picture Sickert ever painted, as evidence that "he did
also eventually notice that the grid of squares on the canvas itself in
some mysterious way contributed something to the painting" so that "he
actually re-painted the squaring-up lines after their original purpose
has been served." She comments, "part of the magic lay in seeming to
bring everything up to the surface" . This technique clearly has a
longer history in Sickert's oeuvre than Lessore remembered.

Perhaps, since the description and technique here is a mixture of wet on
wet and heavy black outline (that is, mixes Degas and Whistler), then
this, too, inscribing a broken grid pattern over wet on wet painting,
declares Sickert is using Degas as well as Whistler. See Wendy Baron's
comments on the impact of Degas on Sickert's technique in "Sickert's Links
with French Painting," 186-197. Baron argues that Sickert derived the
use of squaring up procedures, utterly alien to the technique of Whistler,
from Degas, 188-9; on Sickert's technical practice and squaring up
see the memoir by Clifford Hall, who was Sickert's pupil in the 1920s,
printed in Marjorie Lillie, <I>Sickert: The Painter and his Circle</I>

Sickert wrote in a letter to <I>The Times</I> that "the great painters
painted from drawings that remained stable, and not in the presence
of the 'movie' that is nature. To the extent that the moderns have not
forgotten this, have they succeeded in doing work that could hang beside
that of their predecessors and masters?"; W. Sickert, "Whistler: the
artist in practice" [letter], <I>The Times</I> [no date or issue given],
IC, PCB 1906-1909, June 1934-1938 [n. p.]. This argument is
