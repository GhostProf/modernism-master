1 The Music-Hall Helps the Cause of Colonialism
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
It is 1903, a year after the black American dance, the Cake-Walk,
arrived in Paris and immediately became as popular a dance as the
Charleston would be in the Roaring Twenties. From the circus to the
music-hall, the Cake-Walk attraction was de rigeur. Across town from
the Moulin-Rouge, at the Jardin d'Acclimatation, Ashanti villagers were
providing an equally popular attraction. A review in the <i>Courrier
Fran&ccedil;ais</i> of the floor show currently at the Moulin-Rouge
defends the genre of the <i>Grande Revue ,</i> accused of incessantly
repeating itself. The "grotesque or charming dances" where the art of
"voluptuousness" reigns is the principal element there designed to give
Parisians an hour of "pure pleasure." The pretty legs, splendid decor,
and lighting may be trivial (<i>l&eacute;ger</i>), but they represent a
specifically Parisian art. This art is epitomized by the Moulin Rouge, and

<b></b>

the Moulin Rouge is known the world over by blacks, whites, Asians,
80 year-olds and virgins: "It's a subject of conversation in Tchad and
in Tanganyika." But that is not the only glory of the Grande Revue: the
Moulin Rouge actually contributes to the cause of colonialism! "You can
be sure that at this very moment, heroic . . . explorers, feverish and
tired, deep in the darkness of Africa and among the grimacing blacks,
see in their dreams, rising on the infested swamps the lights and
gracefulness of the Moulin Rouge. And these strong men find in these
trivialities an influx of courage. . . . The raised skirts contribute a
little, just a little, to discoveries a little more important than the
revelation of pretty legs."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
One institution&#8212;the music hall&#8212;nurtures
another&#8212;colonialism.Read this essay in light of the fact that the
music-halls and their predecessors, the caf&eacute;-concerts, are one
of the primary sites for the influx of African, Caribbean, and black
American newcomers in Paris, on-stage as well as off. Turning around the
idea expressed in the above article, here we will see how colonialism
contributed to the music-hall. The images and fantasies that made up
the extraordinary popularity of "grimacing blacks" in the music-hall,
caf&eacute;-concert, and circus, beginning in the late 1870s with
minstrels and African dancers, had a far greater influence on popular
entertainment between 1878 and 1910 than has previously been thought.

2 The Hysteric and the Savage
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Every time that the Belgian artist F&eacute;licien Rops came to Paris, he
was astonished by the fantastical look of the contemporary Parisian woman,
"who seemed to come from another world, <i>as foreign as a Hottentot</i>."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
As I hope to show here, the distance between the image of the Hottentot
and the persona adopted by white music-hall singers and dancers was
not as far as one might imagine.
<p>
In previous work, I have drawn an analogy between hysterics, epileptics,
and caf&eacute;-concert performance. The startling rise in cases of
hysteria coincided in time with the creation in 1875 of a new genre of
caf&eacute;-concert performer called the Epileptic Singer. Mark Micale
has noted that "around 1878, the name of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re
invaded even the popular magazines and newspapers."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
The first sensational displays of African dance and of
half-naked black bodies date from 1878 when Zulus danced at the
Folies-Berg&egrave;re. 1878 is also the year that Darwin's theory of
evolution was officially recognized in France. It is a year to which I
will have occasion to return. The simultaneity of these three spectacular
phenomena&#8212;hysteria, Epileptic Singers, and African dance&#8212;all
highly <i>m&eacute;diatique</i> displays of the body in movement which
reached mass audiences, could not help but create some degree of amalgam
in the popular imagination. Journalistic descriptions show that this is
<i>precisely</i> what occurred, and one of the effects was to inspire
a fear of contagion: of gesture, of hysteria, of regression. That is
the crux of this essay: I want to show how the three attractions are
interconnected. By looking at the extremely popular re of the
Epileptic Singer between 1875 and 1907, we can observe the fusing
of the Hysteric and the Savage in the media and in the minds of the
average French citizen. Colonialism and medicine; science and popular
entertainment; the hysteric and the savage.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Celebrity provides a lens for discovering what people

<b></b>

admire, desire, and deride: in short, for what magnetizes them. How much
the celebrity of these performers might have to do with the self-image
of French spectators will be taken up in the last section of this
essay. It is fair to say that the image of the <i>savage</i>&#8212;so
often emphasized in the way people saw cancan dancers, semi-nude chorus
girls, and the Epileptic Singers I am going to discuss here&#8212;was
in fact the <i>predominant</i> re of the sexually desirable woman
in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and in the beginning of
the twentieth. Exotic articles of strangeness, the hysteric and the
African dancer were awe-inspiring, repulsive to some, and sexually
exciting to nearly all. The attraction of the Savage Woman in France
can be dated as far back as the beginning of the century with the
notoriety of Sartjie Baartman, the so-called Hottentot Venus. The
body of the Hottentot Venus was by far the most popularized image of
a black woman in the nineteenth century, from cartoons to the theater,
and the primitive sexual appetites of this black woman were supposedly
displayed most clearly by her buttocks, which constituted the primary
visual attraction when she was exhibited.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
In the vaudeville play, "The Hottentot Venus or the hatred of French
Women," the African woman performs a song and dance routine which is
"a little grotesque." Nonetheless, this image of Woman did not become
a <i>staple</i> of popular entertainment until the 1870s with the
Epileptic Singers. Why? The two reasons were the tremendous popular
interest in Darwinism <i>and</i> in Charcot's hysterics. (<a name="1"
href="10.4gordon_res.html#1"> 1</a>) The text, "Darwin!,"
by Louis de Gramont that accompanies this 1878 drawing by Andr&eacute;
Gill informs readers that "there are few people among the general public
who don't know the name of Darwin, and his ideas are summarized in
one sentence: 'man descends from the ape.'" Darwin himself is jokingly
rumored to be rehearsing for his debut at the circus. We read: "Where
will the magnificence of the Hippodrome end? They're talking about
hiring the celebrated Darwin who would come to furnish the proof of his
genealogy by exhibiting the prestigious agility that he inherited from
his forefathers (the monkeys).&#8212;M. Littr&eacute;, who shares his
faith and the ancestors of the English savant, will assist him in his
exercises." The drawing by Andr&eacute; Gill shows the naturalist jumping
through a hoop called "Credulity," while the author of the dictionary,
Littr&eacute;, holds the second hoop labeled "Superstitions, Errors,
Ignorance." Their heads are on the bodies of orangutans.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
The fascination with the hysterical body's uncontrollable epileptic
contortions coalesced with the fascination for the excess of agitated
movement in African dance. In both cases, the attraction is to the
"animalistic" and the "savage." As Marianna Torgovnick has written,
the primitive is represented as "libidinous, irrational, violent, and
dangerous," res of our own "wild selves" and unconscious drives.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
The characteristics attributed to the primitive are the same
traits assigned to female hysterics in the nineteenth-century,
a correspondence that Sander Gilman has examined in the context of
medicine and criminology. Popular spectacle played a powerful role in
creating, reinforcing, or changing these stereotypes. The Other may
well be the secret self of taboos, of hidden desire, but thanks to
the nineteenth-century media, the spectacular bodies of the Other are
hypervisible. The convergence of primitivism with the connections forged
between neurosis and modernity in the fin de si&egrave;cle suggests that

<b></b>

we situate the emergence of modernity squarely in the cabaret aesthetic
of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, an aesthetic penetrated
by contemporary psychiatric and biological definitions of Low.
<p>
The belly dance first enthralled and scandalized spectators at the 1889
Exposition Universelle, with the vogue for Spanish dancing following
close behind; among the exotic dancers performing in Paris were la
Belle Otero, Mata Hari, Colette and her intimate friend, Polaire. Along
with Mistinguett, Polaire rose to stardom as an Epileptic Singer,
and her popularity eclipsed that of Mistinguett until around 1910. A
close look at Polaire reveals an underlying association with racial
stereotypes, an important, but now lost, component of her appeal&#8212;an
association with not only African women who were exhibited in Paris
in the nineteenth-century, not only with photographs and drawings
of African women that appeared in popular, middlebrow, and highbrow
magazines, but also with black American entertainers beginning with
touring minstrel shows and culminating in the explosion of a new dance
rage in 1902: the Cake-Walk. To what extent did white singers and dancers
incorporate black traits? Were their motives simply exploitative, or was
there a conscious or unconscious identification with black Americans
or Africans? Some answers should emerge in re-examining performances,
memoirs, and interviews. I begin, then, with Polaire's predecessors and
fellow Epileptic Singers, as well as with the African dancers who shared
the spotlight in the same period.
<p>
As noted in <i>Why the French love Jerry Lewis</i>, "nothing was more
modern, more fashionable between 1880 and 1900 than nervous pathology,
whose jerky rhythms and movements define popular song and performance
style in the period."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
In the present

<b></b>

essay, I want first to focus on aspects of the ugly and grotesque that
coincided with the representation of nervous pathology. In 1886, Maurice
Vaucaire called the caf&eacute;-concert "the spectacle of the ugly,
of the obscene, and of the grotesque. . . . it makes one stupid [but]
this idiotic neurosis has its charm."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Another commentator had a more pessimistic view of the deleterious
effects of the caf&eacute;-concert: "we no longer have simply the
caf&eacute;-concert with its raucous and slightly mad familiarity,
but now the <i>caf&eacute;-cancer</i> with its hideous and stinking
leprosy that eats away at us, that devours our society and that threatens
. . . to make our members fall off in putrefaction."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
As emphasized in <i>Why the French love Jerry Lewis</i>, if the cabaret
and caf&eacute;-concert were low culture, that had to do as much
with their direct appeal to the body as it did with the proportion of
working-class spectators in the audience. The aesthetic categories of
High and Low take on an unsuspected perspective when one takes into
account psychological theories of the lower faculties (sensory-motor
functions, automatisms, instinct) that were so widely disseminated in
the period. Songs like "Nervous," "Too Nervous," "Tata's Tic," and "La
Parisienne &eacute;pileptique" were sung by Epileptic Singers, while
"Peas," "The Hole in my Quai" and "I'm a Neurasthenic" were sung by
Idiot Comics like Dranem and Darius M. They were preceded by Paulus, who
invented the genre of the Agitated Singer in 1870. Andr&eacute; Chadourne
wrote in 1889 that "the public is thirsty for these songs . . . it can't
get enough. And cases of pathology like this are met with more often
than one would think" (<i>LCC</i>, 277). These performers, along with
many others in the last quarter of the nineteenth-century in France,
modeled their performance style on the tics, grimaces, contortions, and
convulsive movements and gestures of epileptics and hysterics. Thanks to
phenomenal media attention on hysteria, the great majority of spectators
recognized this source. The extraordinary popularity of Epileptic Singers
and Idiot Comics exactly coincided with the startling rise in cases
of hysteria in Parisian hospitals, feeding into and capitalizing on a
cultural phenomenon which was just getting underway. It is not by chance
that the style fell out of fashion in France in 1907, at around the same
time that Charcot's spectacular version of hysteria was supplanted by
that of Babinski, and hysterics were no longer being exhibited at the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. One of Charcot's successors, D&eacute;jerine,
boasted that the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re hysterics' ward was as quiet
as a monastery. In fact, the epileptiform attack no longer occurred and
actors and singers thus no longer found it of interest to visit and to
observe gesture. The journalist Georges Montorgueil was only one of many
to point to the relationship with hysteria. He wrote, "A good half of
today's hit songs . . . belong to the late Dr. Charcot's jiggling pit for
the agitated. They jerk and tremble. They have gesticulatory hysteria."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Conversely, the theatrical exhibitions of specialists in nervous
pathology inspired analogies with agitated caf&eacute;-concert singers:
Dr. Luys and three colleagues demonstrating the effects of hypnotic
suggestion are compared to "Paulus . . . presenting his most hysterical
women." Indeed, the hysterical subject Esther begins to sing an air
from an operetta when Luys approaches.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
In its restructuring of the body, hysteria became a cultural phenomenon
and created a new form of expression in the arts. More precisely,
the theme of hysteria in popular entertainment produced a novel form
of spectacle. Contained in the unpretentious but nonetheless

<b></b>

extraordinary modernity of this new form of spectacle were the seeds of
Futurism, Dada, and Surrealism.
<p>
For the last quarter of the century, the
<i>chanteuse&eacute;pileptique</i> was one of the biggest draws in
Parisian night-life. The genre was created by Emilie B&eacute;cat at the
Ambassadeurs in the summer of 1875. For the novelist, J.-K. Huysmans,
Mlle B&eacute;cat is "that epileptic doll bleating and twisting her hips
in those inept convulsions that made her a quasi-celebrity." Huysmans
goes on to describe singers who remind him of La B&eacute;cat: they
hold out their "paws" in front of them "that bob up and down like the
imbecilic paws of porcelain monkeys."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Mlle B&eacute;cat was the first (but not the last) Epileptic Singer
to call forth a comparison with the simian species. Her costume as
well as her movements would be imitated by a host of scantily-clothed
young women. The most famous of them was Polaire, "the agitating
and agitated Polaire . . . in a blouse tight enough to bring on the
spasm (of orgasm) . . . the big, voracious mouth. . . . that face of
a ghoul and of Salome. . . . What a coffee grinder and what a belly
dance! . . . Polaire hops around, trembles, quivers, dances with her
hips, pelvis, and navel, mimes all forms of shocks and shaking."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
Singers routinely used the word "epilepsy" to describe their style:
when Mistinguett adopted a new persona, she explained that she "was
tired of the daily epilepsy." I have described this performance style
in detail elsewhere.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Here, I want to show that under the clowning and the frothy white
petticoats there was more than a little of darkest Africa. (.<a name="2" href="10.4gordon_res.html#2"> 2</a>-<a name="3" href="10.4gordon_res.html#3">3</a>)

3 The Ugly
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The <i>chanteuse &eacute;pileptique</i> created a style of sexual lewdness
combined with clowning and extreme corporeal contortions and grimaces:
the creation of a female grotesque, to use Mary Russo's term.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Montorgueil wrote that they were "so stupefying, so unexpected! And what
clown-like poses!" Some even adopted the clown's hairstyle with a point
at the top, the same hairstyle that could also be seen on minstrels
performing in Paris. "With the contortions of a strangling chicken,
a woman . . . bleated out a popular song."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
The "nervous" gommeuse, Foscolo, "was not afraid . <i>. . to be
ridiculous, to make herself ugly</i>."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Ugliness made singers distinctive and gave them great physical
presence. Similarly, the can-can dancers led by Nini-les-Pattes-en-l'air
"wagered on an exhibition that is the funniest in terms of ugliness."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Even Yvette Guilbert was obliged to magnify ugliness and freakishness to
draw attention in the beginning, "the bad days when I did my 'Brunin'
number, a horrible pointed wig on my skull. You have to be brave to
disre yourself like that: . . . me, the more I'm ridiculous, the
happier I am."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
(The Phenomenon, Brunin, was an uncommonly tall, emaciated man who
danced in a tutu.) "Mlle Abdala, taking advantage of her exceptionally
skinny physique, made the grimace into an art form."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Montorgeuil wrote that Mlle Abdala was "ahead of her time." Not only
was she "a rascally parody of woman, . . . she uses her charm to make
herself ugly," but if one day, singers decide to exploit "a special
distinctive ugliness" in the manner of Black musicians and dancers,

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 624]</b>

then Mlle Abdala "will be a star of the first magnitude."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
The <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> published a long poem on Mlle Abdala
in 1893.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
[She is] a miracle, a prodigy, an artist. She's not like the other
singers that you see everywhere. No. She is a lot rarer, certainly more
<i>bizarre</i>. More than that, if you like, <i>barbarous</i>. Here she
is on stage: it's an apparition that surprises and troubles you, then
hypnotizes your attention. When I saw this crazy woman I thought I was
seeing [something supernatural]. With cynicism and candor, forgetting that
she's a woman, she triples her <i>ugliness</i>. She tortures the mask of
her face, she makes herself as <i>horrible</i> as she can; she ignites
the desire for some fantastic witches' Sabbath. Her neck stretches out,
the head floats above it, the arms resemble <i>the paws of an animal</i>
or anything else you want them to resemble. <i>Her eyes bug out</i>
and <i>hermouth grows bigger to such a point that she can put herfist
into this fearful pit</i>. It is Beauty in Deformity and in excess,
the enormous comedy of <i>lugubriousgaiety</i>.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What Montorgueil saw in Mlle Abdala's ugliness was her resemblance
to the black minstrels who were stealing the spotlight in the fin de
si&egrave;cle; Ponchon's vocabulary reiterates and elaborates on the
analogy, but also underlines the singer's status as prodigy. Prodigy
is the English term for the French "Phenomenon," a category of
performer that will take on new meaning in the wake of Darwinism. The
genre included Siamese twins, giants, midgets, hunchbacked singers,
emaciated comics like Brunin, and the P&eacute;tomane, all of whom
performed in the nineteenth-century caf&eacute;-concert. The taste
for Phenomena existed before the advent of Darwinism in France;
already in 1851 the caf&eacute;-chantant le Grand Concert des Arts,
precursor to the caf&eacute;-concert, hired giants to sing. "Limp,
be one-eyed, extraordinarily thin, fat to bursting, and, in addition,
sing . . . [and] you'll easily earn 1,200 francs a month." The genre
of<i>Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne</i> was at times indistinguishable from
the genre of freak.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
In an 1867 article entitled "Women Phenomena," an outraged journalist
excoriates the American and English equestrian stars, Adah Isaacs
Mencken and Cora Pearl, predicting that this taste for women who were
not only joined to a horse, but whose sexuality was on exhibit would
lead to "Italians climbing a greased pole, which brings us to Lapps and
Hottentots, we will come to that. . . . acrobats, tightrope walkers,
horse-women . . . women with two heads, androgynes, monsters, this is
what we need."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
The amalgam of Phenomena and Hottentots should not surprise us: in fact,
performing Africans and black Americans were often viewed as Phenomena,
and it will be important to look at this effect on white singers who
adopted black characteristics.
<p>
The attraction to ugliness is not present solely in popular culture,
but is, of course, an extremely important characteristic of decadent
literature of the last two decades of the century; it is found in
middle-brow magazines as well. In the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>
of 15 August 1897, a prose piece entitled "Ideal Ugliness" delineates the
"peculiar aesthetics brought about by the love of the unexpected and the
horror of banality." A fin-de-si&egrave;cle Parisian is searching for "an
ideally ugly mistress," one in whom a sort of harmony and an irresistible
attraction would emanate from a hideous face." The woman who meets this
description is Darwinesque: "she singularly pleased him by the unexpected

<b></b>

expressions that her simian physiognomy took on, running the gamut of
the different sensations she felt. . . . instead of a lovely smile,
she had a ferocious sneer and contortions of the cheeks." He loves her
"receding forehead, without a brain."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Desire is aroused in women as well; a short piece entitled "The Lover
who makes you Laugh" describes the attraction of "a pretty performer,
a bit crazy," for a comic in a second-rung theater whose grimaces are
rewarded by her kisses. "He is ugly, and yet his physiognomy has nothing
displeasing about it; he resembles a monkey more than a man."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
The ugliness of the singer Mademoiselle Abdala, the contortions of
singers like Paulus and Eloi Ouvrard, and the brainless look of idiot
comics like Dranem were part and parcel of an aesthetics of ugliness,
itself enriched by the fascination surrounding Darwinism. If more proof
of the attraction of this constellation in popular spectacle is wanted,
one could cite a review of Ouvrard by Jean d'Arc: "He's a skinny little
man with . . . no stomach and an unfinished thorax, pointed knees,
angular arms; oh! there are angles everywhere on this runt's body,
something automatic in his gestures. . . . <i>a face that is admirably
simian</i>, crazily planted on top of a package of nerves."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, new forms of the grotesque&#8212;always a magnetic element
in popular spectacle from the Middle Ages on&#8212;re-emerged in
the mid-nineteenth-century as the allure of ugliness in singers and
comics. Minstrels were able to capitalize on this fascination in the
1880s. In fact, black minstrels and the black-face genre dubbed "Les
Exotiques" were becoming so popular with audiences that the journalist
Montorgueil predicted they might one day triumph and singers disappear
(see below). His assessment would prove to be right on the money, as
will become clear when we discover how eagerly white musical singers
seized upon the association with blackness that became part of their
aura. Despite the d&eacute;collet&eacute;, the lavish display of
undergarments and the sexual content of the songs, the erotic appeal of
some of the singers is, as we see, at best a curious one. This essay will
suggest that the attraction of the erotic fused with the comic, extending
even to a delight in ugliness, was at the heart of the popularity of
both black entertainers and of the Epileptic Singers. Certainly, it is
the attraction of novelty. Yet its pleasures are riskier than simply
experiencing the new.
<p>
The mixture of contorted corporeal poses, comical grimaces, and unabashed
sexuality in lyric, movement, and dress may be difficult to understand
today. It had certainly never been seen before on stage. However, if the
combination of grotesque comedy and eroticism was new to the stage, the
very same mix existed in the hysterical attacks of a great many female
patients at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re Hospital. An 1878 case history
of a hysteric describes her curious attack of hysterical chorea:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The face grimaces horribly, [resumes its ordinary expression, and
grimaces again . . . She gets up, walks around dragging her leg and]
then begins the habitual jolts and shaking. Her left leg contracts
and the entire member is taken over by a stamping movement. Finally,
she suffers a fit of manic agitation where she laughs without reason,
gesticulates, jumps and dances. The next day, she is taken over by a
mad fury consisting of grimaces, sticking out her tongue, and bizarre
poses that change every instant."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Chorea, a dance-like mania involving chronic agitation of the members, was
associated with hystero-epilepsy beginning in 1878, just three years after
Emilie B&eacute;cat created the genre of the chanteuse &eacute;pileptique,
and case observations of hysterics and epileptics with chorea in the
<i>Iconographie photographique de la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re</i> (such
as the one just cited) and in the <i>Nouvelle Iconographie</i> could
easily have served to describe the performances of those singers. "In
jumping chorea, patients jump in rhythmic fashion, absolutely as though
they were dancing."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Pierre Janet's hysterical patient Rose sings and takes a little bow
after her attack of chorea: "She was a caf&eacute;-concert singer
[before her confinement at the hospital] and she probably thinks that
she's on stage, for she sings very funny little songs for us."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Conversely, Jane Avril was a patient at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re
before becoming a star of the Moulin Rouge.
<p>
The can-can, in the view of many commentators also replicates
hyst&eacute;ro-epilepsy. For Jules Claretie, "This epilepsy is to dance
itself what the hideous couplet shouted from the depths of filthy dives
is to song. And it becomes even more atrocious when the epileptic is
a female dancer. Out of Woman's charm, this crazed abandon makes a
hard-to-qualify unhealthy stamping and bizarre bonelessness that recall
the attacks of nervous disease in that period of shaking and convulsions
that science itself has named the period of clownism." He asks, "What
has all this can-can flesh become? In what concierge loges, in what
corners of the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re do these quadrille dancers drag
themselves along?"
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
In 1899, novelists and journalists were still comparing the can-can
to hystero-epilepsy. After describing the annual Ball of Madwomen and
Hysterics at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, Georges Montorgueil writes,
"The real Mad Ball is at the Moulin-Rouge, when the quadrille led by
Rayon d'or or la Goulue unleashes that hystero-epilepsy that female
clowns translate into the indecent skirt-raising [of the can-can]."

<p>
Dancing itself was far from being considered an innocent corporeal
expression, and in the 1870s, alienists insisted on the relationship of
dance to hysteria.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
Dr. Paul-Max Simon wrote in 1877 that "one put one's nervous system
in unison with the jiggling and stamping of the music of Offenbach,
and one invariably became hysterical and sometimes insane."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The theory of unconscious imitation to which the psychiatrist's
hyperbolic observation is indebted drew on experiments in psycho-physical
stimulus response and experiments in hypnotic suggestion; the unconscious
impulse to imitate directional forces and gesture, psychiatrists
concluded, came from the unconscious. This theory continued to hold
sway in the popular imagination in the early twentieth century. A 1907
song entitled "La Cin&eacute;matomagite," interpreted by the epileptic
comic, Darius M., illustrates it in the context of early cinema:
"When I was employed in the cinema business [as a projectionist],
I quickly caught a strange illness. As a result of watching the films
jiggle and tremble, I can't stop myself from fidgeting; something in
me continually dances. I have ci-ci-ci cinematomagitate. From head to
rump I feel the vibrations. . . . it's the nerves at work."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
The effects of this pathology are sexual: "when

<b></b>

I see a [woman's] calf, I can't stay still; my cane stands up from bottom
to top." As is most often the case, the uncontrollable movements inspired
by popular spectacle are tied to libidinous sexual behavior.
<p>
A year after Dr. Simon published the above observation, Parisians were
exposed to several strange new dance exhibitions. As indicated earlier,
1878 was a capital year for

<b></b>

dance and, as a result, for concerns about contagion: it was the year
of the first Exposition Universelle to exhibit an officially sanctioned
African village and to showcase African dancing.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
It was the year that Zulus first danced on Music Hall stages at the
Folies-Berg&egrave;re.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
It also saw the first crest of popularity of the Epileptic Singer,
and it was the first time that case observations of chorea appeared in
the <i>Iconographie photographique de la Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re ,</i>
then in its second year of publication.
<p>
Concurrently with the appearance of minstrels in France, beginning in
1877, large numbers of Parisians came to the Jardin d'acclimatation to see
the "African Villages," a scientifically endorsed ethnological exhibit.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
The first of these exhibits presented fourteen "Nubians" who had been
transported from Africa along with a number of exotic animals. "Paris
always needs a special attraction. Right now, its curiosity is vividly
transported to the Jardin d'acclimatation."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
This "special attraction," as the journalist writing in
<i>L'Illustration</i> called it, fed Parisians' curiosity with the
spectacle of a group of people going about their daily activities. Their
physical characteristics, their dress and their habits seemed
extraordinarily uncivilized to the casual observer, whose impressions
were soon confirmed by anthropologists. Soon, to add to the thrill of
the attraction, mating rituals and cannibalism were mimed as part of the
ethnological exhibits. Initially sanctioned as scientific, they became
more and more theatrical and commercialized. The "Amazons" of Dahomey
were first brought to Paris in 1891; 800,000 visitors came to see the
tableaux vivants at the Jardin reenacting the fierce battle that French
forces waged against the warriors defending Abomey. A small number of
women fought alongside the men: they were soon to achieve mythic status
as Amazons. West Africans were in fact only presented to the French
"after the exhibits . . . were turned into circus spectacles. The
consequence was that, following the lead of illustrated magazines, the
ethnographic exhibits made certain to show West Africans in a spectacular
and sensational decor. The accent was put on their bizarre costumes,
their ferocity and their savagery in order to attract and entertain
the crowds."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
The exotic animals in captivity displayed alongside the villagers were
not the only unflattering juxtaposition. "Monsters"&#8212;dwarfs and
giants&#8212;were also exhibited at the Jardin d'acclimatation. As
mentioned before, they had already been popular acts in the
caf&eacute;-concert for some time. In fact, among the scientific
studies published in the first issue (in 1873) of the <i>Bulletin of
the Anthropological Society of Paris</i> was Cl&eacute;mence Royer's
study of the so-called Russian Dog-Man and his son (father and son
were exhibited in Barnum's touring circus). The convergence of science
and popular spectacle of course continued into the twentieth century,
with scientists in the fledgling fields of anthropology and criminology
capitalizing on the presence in France of Africans and of physically
different individuals.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
The 1909 exhibit and performance of dwarfs in the Jardin d'acclimatation
furnishes a good example: not only did popular weekly magazines devote
articles and photographs to the exhibit, but the Anthropological Society
of Paris also published an article comparing the dwarfs to Pygmies who
were previously on exhibit. Simultaneously, an article in <i>Comoedia</i>
jokes about the famous criminal anthropologist Alphonse Bertillon rushing
to the Jardin to make anthropometric measurements of the dwarfs' members.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
The attraction of bodily otherness was paramount

<b></b>

in nineteenth-century entertainment, and in the latter part of the century
the attractions based on this appeal were tied to the fears surrounding
the physical malformations and mental deficits of Degeneration.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
With the advance of Darwinism (<i>The Descent of Man</i> was translated
into French in 1872), Haeckel's idea quickly gained ground: for centuries,
in the development of species only the lower forms of mental activity
had existed, and the higher forms were had recently evolved.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
As cases of hysteria and degeneration multiplied, prehistoric
craniums were compared to the craniums of microcephalics and
imbeciles. Evolutionary regression and nervous pathology were not
only considered to be related, but one was sometimes even mistaken
for the other. If, to the average French spectator, the agitation of
"primitive" peoples resembled that of epileptics and hysterics, the
fact that "savages" were major attractions in the same period as the
Epileptic Singers and minstrels no doubt contributed to the assimilation
of hysteria and black performers in the popular imagination. Finally,
a confusion existed in physical anthropology between the craniums
of prehistoric humans and contemporary peoples such as Africans
and Australians. As early as 1888, the secretary-general of the
Anthropological Society of Paris, Paul Topinard, had written in <i>La
Nature</i> that races such as Australian aborigines and Hottentots were
soon to become extinct because of their inability to adapt. Soon after
this article appeared, his reconstitution of primitive life at the 1889
Universal Exposition attempted to demonstrate that contemporary "savage
and barbarous races are the same humans as our European ancestors."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
This confusion also found a home in the theater, as the skull of
a present-day Australian was given a hierarchical place in a row of
skulls presented at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Antoine in 1908 (the year
that the so-called Missing Link was discovered in central France).
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
A 1909 article in <i>Comoedia</i> by the creator of the exhibit at the
theater is worth citing.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every newspaper announced in 1908 that a Monkey-Man (<i>unhomme-singe</i>)
had just been discovered. . . . The Pithecanthropus . . . The missing
link. [The cranium] is perfectly equivocal: tiny indications of the simian
race are undisputable and, nonetheless, to cite M. Manouvrier (of the
Mus&eacute;e Dupuytren) . . . "it's a trueParisian brain!" . . . This
poor cousin who returns from his provincial backwaters after an exile
of <i>50 thousandyears</i> feels quite at home amidst our electric
luxury. . . . Does this discovery corroborate the theory of evolution
(<i>transformisme</i>) concerning the origins of man? . . . Mr. Boule
aligned . . . six craniums in the very same order that I exhibited them
attheTh&eacute;&acirc;treAntoine<b>,</b> that of a chimpanzee . . . then,
in order of merit, Java, Neanderthal, Chapelle-aux-Saints, present-
day Australian, and Homo Sapiens. The orthodox refuse to believe that
there is a missing link. When shown a cranium, they cry: "A degenerate!"
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the scientific search for the missing link was of such keen
interest to the general public that even the craniums became a theatrical
attraction. Judging from the brain, Parisians weren't that far removed
from monkeys after all, particularly Parisians who were afflicted with
Degeneration. Perhaps this explains the extraordinary success of so
many performing chimpanzees in Parisian music-halls. The year that the
missing link was discovered in France, the Grand-Guignol "Theater of Fear"
staged the comedy

<b></b>

"The Little Baboon" and Mistinguett brought her pet monkey on stage,
eliciting the kind of hilarious laughter that she herself had garnered
when she was a chanteuse &eacute;pileptique. The chimpanzees "Monsieur et
Madame X" were "frenetically applauded" at the Olympia in 1909. Darwin's
theory of evolution, more and more discussed in France and manipulated
to fit notions of social hierarchies, offered a scientific explanation
for white superiority. Physical anthropologists were eager to uncover
simian characteristics in Africans, beginning with Georges Cuvier's 1817
report published in the <i>M&eacute;moires du Mus&eacute;um</i>, a year
after the dissection of the body of Sartjie Baartmann, whose movements
the naturalist described as "brusque and capricious, recalling those of
a monkey. . . . She danced in the style of her country."
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
In addition to the extraordinary popularity of the "ethnological
exhibits" described above, enormous crowds came to the 1878, 1889
and 1900 Expositions Universelles to see the natives of the Congo,
Dahomey, and S&eacute;n&eacute;gal perform songs and dances. In
1910, the movements of African dance continue to thrill spectators
and to elicit the same comparisons: "The tom-tom is father of
formidable leaps, of stupefying contortions, hilarious grimaces,
frenetic entrechats. . . . <i>The tom-tom is the synthesis of Negro
life</i>. . . . The lanky dancer crouches until he resembles a dwarf,
then he leaps, contorts himself, dislocates his body, grimaces . . . with
the gestures and grimaces of a monkey."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>

<p>
A journalist in the magazine <i>Fantasio</i> writes that "In Africa,
lascivious dances to barbaric rhythms accompany the meeting of the
sexes. . . . Certain black women here and there are cannibals. But their
charm is only heightened by it, from what one says. . . ."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
Posters foregrounding the bare-breasted Amazon warriors of Dahomey
served to advertize the hugely successful play "Au Dahomey" at the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Porte Saint-Martin in 1892. In 1893,
a spectacular show featuring 100 Dahomeyans and 25 Amazons was
presented at the Casino de Paris and attended by <i>2.7 million
spectators</i>, not counting those who went to see other Dahomey
extravaganzas at the wax museum and at the circus. (<a name="5"
href="10.4gordon_res.html#5"> 5</a>) A book review of
<i>The Man with the Glass Eye, Adventures in Dahomey</i> states that
"regrettable incidents have attracted the attention of all French people
to this part of the big, mysterious continent."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
So it was that highly sexualized savages and cannibals populated the
imaginations of the French in the 1880s through the first decade of the
twentieth century. What spectators savored, according to many accounts,
was the amount of flesh bared and the frenzied movements, and this was in
strict parallel to the attraction of the chanteuse &eacute;pileptique. It
should be noted that the spectacle of African Amazons (as well as the
1893 exhibition of Achantis in the Jardin d'acclimatation) coincided
in time with Polaire's rise to fame between 1890 and 1895.

</h3>


<p>
It is 1908: the combination of undress, "excessive movement," agitation,
and obscene gyrations&#8212;previously associated with Epileptic Singers
and now firmly meshed with African dancers and the fantasies surrounding
African women&#8212;is still very much in demand on Paris stages. "A
fashion has taken over, the fashion of the nude. Little by little,
our artists appeared barely belted from the navel to the hips, in the
fashion of

<b></b>

Negresses. . . . painfully contorting themselves. And then another variety
of nude was dreamed up . . . she . . . who presents herself like meat
on the rack. Even the loincloth of the Negro is discarded.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
It is the African woman who springs to mind whenever contorted and
sexual movement is combined with the naked female body. In addition to
characterizations as obscene or animalistic, descriptions of the acts of
Epileptic Singers in the 1890s when the style was at its peak contain
striking analogies to portraits of Africans or black Americans in the
same period. Journalists focus on the singers' "<i>big nostrils</i>"
and big mouth as well as on their <i>d&eacute;colletage</i>and the fact
that they are <i>" d&eacute;-cul-ot&eacute;e on the bottom .</i>"
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Naya is "<i>a little animal</i> with a chignon"; Vanoni possesses "the
<i>furious grace of the American</i>, the gymnastic pantomime of this
<i>unleashed Fury</i>owes something to the Hanlon-Lees."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
She is "<i>The Agitated One</i>."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Can-can dancers, too, carried associations with black women: Andr&eacute;
Chadourne wanted to "stop those horrifying exhibitions of women found
in the worst gutters . . . these Goulues, these Grilles-d'&eacute;gout

<b></b>

who dance on the French stage the kind of dance steps that are unknown
even to the lowest form of savages" (<i>LCC</i>, 311).
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
The commercial attraction of obscenity&#8212;or at the very least, of
sexual provocation&#8212;was central to the Epileptic Singers' rise to
fame as it was to the popularity of the can-can, and it is no less central
to the draw of African women in the eyes of the media. The chanteuse
&eacute;pileptique successfully embodies and capitalizes on Otherness:
loss of control in epilepsy and hysteria, the behavior and language
of a prostitute. Like Africans, they were labeled "animalistically
aggressive." Even in the 1930s, Mistinguett was singing, "I'm looking
for a millionaire, and that's why I walk the boulevards." When she finds
him, she sings, "now kiss me. Harder, still harder, a kiss <i>&agrave;
la cannibale</i>!"
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Yet, singers perform in a way that is grotesque and <i>comical</i>
enough to make the frightening aspects palatable. Later, Josephine
Baker would temper the "man-eating" threat of the highly sexualized
"black savage" by crossing her eyes.
<p>
Scientific theories about sexual deviance were rife in the nineteenth
century, and often preposterous. Sartje Bartman's genitalia, covered by
a loincloth, were the focus of countless fantasies and rumored to be
strangely extended like an apron. Scientific studies of the genitalia
supposedly established links between the sexuality of the black woman,
the lesbian and the prostitute, as well as implying freakishness and
bestiality.
<p>
A large painting of a Hottentot woman occupies a very prominent place at
the entrance to Topinard's exhibit in the 1889 Exposition Universelle;
it attests the persistence of the image of the Hottentot Venus 75
years after her death in France. At the end of the nineteenth century,
Cesare Lombroso again pointed out the analogy between the physical
characteristics of Hottentots and prostitutes.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
Zola's heroine, the courtisan Nana, became an overnight star in
her role as the Blond Venus, a name that would automatically evoke
her predecessor, the Black Venus. Indeed, the play "La V&eacute;nus
noire" was having a successful run at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre du
Ch&acirc;telet in 1878; <i>Nana</i> was published in installments in
1879-80. Even if this role was clearly modeled on Offenbach's "La
Belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne," there exists, nonetheless, the echo I
am suggesting.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
One indication that the Blond and Black Venus remained tied as
complementary opposites in French minds is offered in the person of one
of the only music-hall performers to rival Polaire in popularity. La
Belle Otero, known primarily for her Spanish dances, but who did not
hesitate to dance the Cake-Walk, opened the 1903 season in a play
called "Dream of Opium." In it, she is a "wild Venus (<i>V&eacute;nus
fauve</i>) with a black mane and powerful arms, savage, but Goddess
nevertheless." The reviewer salutes her "terrible voluptuousness" that
does not possess the beauty of the blond Venus, but rather "the robust,
crude, and powerful beauty . . . that destroys and creates."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
The unbridled sexuality of the prostitute,"an atavistic form of humanity"
according to writers like Lombroso, is a regression to a primitive
stage of evolutionary development, just like the hysteric's.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
"The links between prostitution, madness, and hysteria were fundamental
in contemporary writing on prostitution," according to Alain Corbin.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
One of these links was the loss of control represented by unleashed
sexuality; another was the "love of dancing" characteristic of
degenerates and of savages.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
Charles Bernheimer has written that "hysterics on display at the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re were the prime

<b></b>

stimulus for many of the male fantasies about female sexuality previously
projected onto prostitutes."
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
We need to add that that stimulus was matched by the gaze that was
focused on African women.

6 Chocolat and Chocolates
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In a 1909 Revue at the Olympia, Foottit played an American impresario
who comes to Paris to "steal" the stars of the music-hall away from
Paris. The American is accompanied by "his wife, a N&eacute;gresse,
agile as a monkey (played by Chocolat) and his son, a fantastical dwarf."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
Black Americans are in fact stealing the show from Parisian stars, and
their popularity in music-halls is mirrored by other bizarre or unusual
performers such as dwarfs and monkeys. Minstrels were so popular that
the word was included among the 45 English words every French person
absolutely needed to know in case of an British invasion, along with
water-closet, music-hall, and Darwin's baby.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>

<p>
The most famous black performer of the period was the clown
Chocolat. Willy's friend Curnonsky called Foottit's side-kick (emphasis on
kick) "Foottit's <i>shadow</i>, the inseparable Chocolat." Jean Cocteau
described him as a "stupid Negro in tight black silk pants . . . serving
as a pretext for blows."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
Most often seen in the company of his white partner, Foottit, Chocolat's
celebrity nevertheless exceeded the bounds of the comic numbers the
pair performed at the Nouveau Cirque. His elegance and grace outside
of the circus act can be seen in Toulouse-Lautrec's 1896 lithograph,
"Chocolat Dancing in a Bar." In 1894, Chocolat was already "legendary
[and] the favorite amuser of the crowds" for the theater critic of the
<i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, Jean D'Arc.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

<p>
Could Chocolat make women's hearts beat faster? A little
tale by Jules Renard entitled "Pierre et Berthe" answers in the
affirmative. Ten-year-old Berthe announces to nine-year-old Pierre that
she wants to marry Chocolat. Pierre: "He wouldn't want you." Berthe:
"But I want him." P: "It's forbidden for a white woman to marry a black
man. People on the street would say: You see that little girl, she's the
wife of a Negro!" B: "I don't care, because I love him." P: "Why do you
love him instead of Footitt?" (sic) B: "Because he doesn't wear a wig
or make-up. I love him, I love him." P: "He doesn't love you." . . . B:
"He already loves me because he gave me some chocolates." P: "Chocolat
gave you chocolates because you were at the circus. He gives them to
everyone. . . . At the circus, yes, he's very nice, but not in town. In
town, a Negro is always mean." When Pierre accuses Berthe of being a
gourmande (a glutton), she exclaims, "You imagine that I want to eat
him like a chocolate candy?"
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
Little Berthe is naive, but she correctly interprets Pierre's insult. The
correlation between Chocolat, chocolates, and&#8212;as we will have
occasion to verify&#8212;Africans selling chocolates clearly has to
do with fantasies about cannibalism. Better to eat than be eaten by a
black man, as the chocolates in the form of black babies sold in America
not so many decades ago remind us. If we look at the advertisements
that Willette drew for the candy manufacturer Pihan, we can see 
Chocolat himself presenting them,  a Pierrot licking the hand and
arm of a lovely and scantily-attired African woman and saying: "It's
Pihan chocolate," and  a drawing that is very much along the same
lines as the story of

<b></b>

little Berthe. A black Pierrot perched on a box with a palm-tree decor,
dangles chocolate hearts in front of adorable little French girls
(of around 6 to 10 years old) who are jumping up, trying to catch the
chocolates in their mouths! One little girl has fallen over, landing
in a position that very much resembles a sexual posture often found in
Willette's drawings of cocottes; the bug-eyed stare of the black clown
would seem to confirm this interpretation.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
The chocolate hearts, like romantic black men, are bait for innocent
young French girls. A monkey descending from the palm tree is juxtaposed
to the black man.
<p>
Laughing at black people amounts to a national pastime, and it defuses
the threat represented by black virility. But what about <i>black</i>
laughter? In this drawing, it is just as threatening and frightening as
the white fantasies about sexual virility and cannibalism that made it
necessary to ridicule blacks.
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
(<a name="6" href="10.4gordon_res.html#6"> 6</a>) Like
the description of the mouth in the poem "Boumboum" below, the gleaming
white teeth of this laughing mouth seem ready to bite and devour. Perhaps
black laughter <i>was</i> angry; a French review of black dancers in
America emphasizes the "Negro's ability to find every opportunity to
grimace with his comical face," at the same time describing this face as
"mark[ing] the transition from man to gorilla." The 1910 article begins
with a condemnation of lynching in America, 500 or 600 in any given year:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
it's a solution to the Black menace. . . . Lynching and beating has
even lost its savor for their demanding taste; the Negro is now burned
at the stake. The Negro continues nevertheless to thumb his nose
at hisexecutioner with a childlike insouciance and the swagger of a
schoolboy's tricks which is not without its grandeur [in this] country
where the struggle for life takes on the somber aspect of murderous
grappling, the Negro, with his face of soot broken by the white flash
of his teeth and his mocking eyes, would seem to represent the only real
gaiety of the United States. The Negro is smiling.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Selling chocolates is an acceptable way for black men to make a living
in Paris&#8212;as long as they are not too successful. If so, they again
constitute a threat. In Raoul Ponchon's poem, "Boumboum," the "Negro
of the Esplanade" sells candies he imports from Africa. He is "starved
for lucre" as "he calls out, 'Boumboum' and . . . reveals a terrible maw
that glimmers like lightning in a black night. Boumboum! That is to say,
bon-bon, I think. Boumboum, shouts Bamboula, opening a savage oven,
so wide that you say to yourself: he's going to fall into his own mouth."
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
The merchant's gaping maw threatens to devour the Parisians around
him. This is the same gaping maw that we saw in the depiction of Mlle
Abdala. The unconscious connection between black men, chocolates,
and cannibalism could hardly be clearer. But the fear is economic
and social as well, for he is swallowing up profits that used to be
made by Parisians. And, even worse, his success opens the flood gates
of African immigration. The only hope is to make Africans themselves
into products for Parisian consumers. Thus, at the end of the poem,
all these Africans invading Paris are called "exotic products."
<p>
The black mouth also amazed spectators when Hicks' Georgia Minstrels
toured Australia and New Zealand in 1877. A reviewer wrote that they
were "genuine delineators of the Ethiopian character as it is seen in
the United States of America, and as

<b></b>

such they are simply inimitable. . . . two of the gentlemen have mouths
which, when expanded, present an exhibition well worth the entrance
money alone, for every time they open them, they seem as if they were
trying to swallow their own heads. Nor is the company altogether weak
in the vocal line."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>

<p>
Jean Lorrain's portrait of Polaire cited above draws attention to her
"big, voracious mouth." Polaire changed her name from Emilie-Marie
Bouchaud because she thought the name sounded too much like the name of
a Zolian character. One can regret the change, because it would be easy
to read "bouche chaude" (hot mouth) in her last name. During the second
Empire, the mouth of the greatest female star of the caf&eacute;-concert,
Th&eacute;r&eacute;sa, was also the focus of attention. She was the
only nineteenth-century female singer to have achieved the same degree
of popularity and notoriety as Polaire would. "Her mouth stretches all
the way around her head; for lips, the cushions of the Negro, and they
spew out the truffles found in the gutter." And the audience becomes
her mirror: "The animal maw [of the public] has to be fed on rotten meat
from now on."
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
She was also linked to the theme of freakishness: her biggest hit was
"The Bearded Lady."

7 Minstrels, The Cake-Walk, and the Black Menace
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In 1886, Maurice Vaucaire described the caf&eacute;-concert genre,
"Les Exotiques:"



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
English or Americans in black-face, in black tights, both agile and
heavy. Heavy in order to impress the public who is thrilled when it
hears the stage boards resonate under their feet (and) their insane
pratfalls. Fists in the face, kicks in the pants, blows to the gut
and on the head! It makes them sweat, the poor devils, and the sweat
runs freely, taking off the sooty brown varnish that they've applied
to their face. Their white eyes, their white teeth give to this black
physiognomy an air of the good Negro. In this way they're as likeable
as they are terrifying.
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In 1895, "the Parisian minstrels in strange costumes . . . sing, play
the guitar, and give the impression of some tormented dream. We will no
doubt have the opportunity to come back to this bizarre, this disturbing
and amusing trio."
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
Black minstrels are "bizarre and disturbing, the "tormented dream" of a
white public, as well as amusing. But when the blows fly, the audience
exults. (<a name="7" href="10.4gordon_res.html#7"> 7</a>)
They are "burlesque . . . as Negroes know how to be."
<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>

<p>
When, in 1893, Georges Montorgueil reflected on the longevity of the
minstrel genre, he recognized the family resemblances with other acts
that had won favor with the public <i>precisely because</i> they echoed
the bizarre appearance (or so-called ugliness) and the burlesque violence
of minstrel acts, violence "which always makes us rejoice." He surmised
that it would be the wave of the future.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
To satisfy this taste . . . the [caf&eacute;]-concert pads its repertoire
with fat-bellied clowns, familiar Englishmen . . . with tiny hats. . . whose teeth are broken and who fall with a loud bang. . . . We
must recognize, in the ability of these minstrels to keep themselves on
the programs of the summer caf&eacute;-concerts, an indication of the
programs of the future where this exhibition will occupy a place rivaling
songs. And maybe an hour will strike when the caf&eacute;-concert will
be a place without any concert at all. . . . The singer will come there
to exploit a special, distinctive ugliness like the musical Negroes,
and Mlle Abdala will be a star of the first magnitude.
<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>

<p>
If one of the threats that black performers posed was to become so popular
as to threaten the disappearance of other caf&eacute;-concert genres,
then it was necessary to copy them. I want to show here that not only
did the <i>movements</i> of black entertainers influence white singers
and dancers, but their grimaces and perceived "ugliness" constituted an
attraction that also inspired white Epileptic Singers.
<p>
On 1 November 1902, an American troupe presented a new dance, one
which was to become what the French call "un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne de
soci&eacute;t&eacute;." That dance was the Cake-Walk.
<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
Introduced in the review <i>Les Joyeux N&egrave;gres</i> at the
Nouveau-Cirque by Mr. and Mrs. Elks and their troupe, the jerky,
syncopated rhythms of the Cake-Walk were described by Jean Cocteau: "They
danced: skinny, crooked, their . . . knees higher than their thrust-out
chins. . . . wrenching their gestures from themselves. . . . They reared,
they kicked, they broke themselves in two, three, four. . . . The
delirious public was on

<b></b>

its feet stamping. Never has a trendy spectacle composed of saltpeter,
not even the first jazz music accompanying the dances of Gaby Deslys
at the Casino de Paris, never has a spectacle been comparable to this
apparition."
<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
Note that Cocteau published this account a full decade after Josephine
Baker's Paris debut in 1925.
<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
The next years witnessed a veritable explosion of cake-walk-o-mania. (<A
NAME="8" href="10.4gordon_res.html#8"> 8</a>) At the
Ambassadeurs, Strit performed "La cakewalkomanie," Odette Auber sang
"Professeur de cakewalk," Anna Dancrey sang, "with his cakewalk he
charms me, my little Negro." "Uncle Tom" and "Black American" were sung
by Epileptic Singers and Foottit and Chocolat parodied the dance. The
mania was not limited to the stage. In 1903, several Cake-Walk films
were released. In a very brief period of time, however, the "elegance"
perceived by the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> journalist disappears
(it was, moreover, entirely overlooked by Cocteau in his 1935 memoir),
giving way to a vision of a backward slide to a prior stage of
evolution. Of the six American films of the dance held at the Library
of Congress, only one resembles the descriptions that can be read and
seen on film in France, the "Comedy Cake-Walk"; all the others are far
more elegant and restrained in movement.
<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
It would seem that Cake-Walk dancers in France quickly adapted their
performances to French expectations, expectations that one can only
surmise were the fruit of the African spectacles which had preceded
their arrival on French shores. The 1899 program for M. B. Curtis'
Afro-American Minstrels and Variety Company thus becomes more
comprehensible to us. After a "Lilliputian Creole Contortion Danseuse,"
"The Grand Cake Walk" is presented. "Participated in by 16 Devotees
of Delsarte, who stand ready to defend their claim as Champions on the
merits of Style, Grace and

<b></b>

Execution."
<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
(Fran&ccedil;ois Delsarte [1811-1871] was a theorist and teacher of
drama and mimicry who put forth gestural language as the most direct
expression of the Soul.) Accordingly, the reviewer writes, "the Cake
Walk was a decided novelty, and the house was charmed by this unique
spectacle of Negro grace."
<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>
In his report from New Orleans, Harry Tr&eacute;mont underlined the
difference I am pointing out: "the serious (solemn) cake-walk [is] not
one of these grotesque, meaningless contortions which were recently
an epidemic in our salons, but a real competition of elegance where
a cake is the prize." Yet, only a page later, the reporter reverts to
the commonplace perception, the one that governs French spectators. "The
eyes roll comically. . . . the couples begin to move. What an exhibition
of expertly clown-like graces! You're supposed to walk with elegance
[but] you would think they were cocks in heat. Moreover, they have an
irresistibly libidinous temperament. . . . then the rhythm accelerates
. . . frenetically [which] forces them to make incredible contortions."
<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
The implications of frenetic rhythm and the raw energy exhibited in
black bodies dancing the Cake-Walk, as we see, include not only physical
prowess but a "libidinous temperament." The latter is underlined in
the contemporary press on a remarkably frequent basis.
<p>
An elegant young Parisian couple, seated at a caf&eacute;, the man
haggard and fatigued, watch as a tall, proud Sudanese man walks by. This
is an advertizement for a pick-me-up that claims to be an antidote to
neurasthenia. The woman asks her companion: "Why don't <i>you</i> take
Kola Marque. It seems that it's thanks to Kola Marque that the Sudanese
and other exotics are so solid and vigorous."
<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>
In the 25 August 1900 issue of

<b></b>

<i>Le Rire</i>, a middle-aged Bourgeois returns home to find his wife
in bed with a black man. Both are startled and afraid, but the husband
exclaims: "Ah, so <i>you're</i> the Negro: please continue." In another
drawing, an elegant threesome is composed of a Parisienne with a black
man on each arm.
<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>
Dangerous attraction, to say the least, judging from other drawings. An
African tribal chief tells a tall, young member of the tribe who is
handcuffed to a Parisian cocotte in lingerie and black stockings: "We
have all we need for now; we'll eat her when we're in the Sahara." An
African is dancing wildly in the background.
<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>
A poem by Raoul Mayence entitled "The Black Peril" sums up the fear
of black men: "Negroes prowl around your women in the Luxembourg
Gardens. . . . Perhaps their ambition is to subjugate and captivate
all of Paris."
<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>

<p>
"The Trial of the week" by Lucien Perrin, featured in the first issue
of the 1892 <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>offers one example of the
"Black Peril."



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The Negro, Jo Adeko, had at his side a charming little woman, as blond
and white as he was black. Ah! The rascally Negro! Or, rather, the
rascally white woman! . . . for this Negro had irresistible attributes,
if Ibelieve the scandalous chronicles and the number of his conquests
[which] attest brilliantly to his worth; decidedly, nobody can surpass
Negroes in this domain: such was, at least, the conclusion drawn by the
women present at the trial. . . . Poor Parisian males, what Pygmies we
are next to this Hercules of love. . . . This Negro . . . is of royal
heritage. . . . What decadence, my prince: now he sells chocolates in
front of a grocery shop. . . . The Negro and his mistress were sentenced
to a week's imprisonment.
<sup><a name="REF92" href="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
But the sexual energy in the Cake-Walk could also be seen as a form of
Devolution: "The lower we descend in the scale of animal life, the more
prominent do the motor reactions become. This life is primarily of the
instinctive type," wrote the American psychologist Boris Sidis in 1908.
<sup><a name="REF93" href="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>
The raw energy and abandon of the body in the Cake-Walk with all
its implications of regression, sexual violence, and the domination
of the "lower orders" is imported into France from an "uncivilized"
place: black America. The spectacle is, at the same time, exotic. "The
operetta 'Floradora' is so exotic that it cannot fail to excite and
retain Parisian curiosity. . . . An extraordinary Cake-Walk sends the
audience into delirium with its simian gestures."
<sup><a name="REF94" href="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>
In Raoul Ponchon's poem, "Le Cake-Walk," we learn that the energy
and agitation of the dance comes down to us from our (fore)fathers,
the apes! "This dance of our fathers, the monkeys [is composed of]
agitation and twisting in the attempt to bite oneself. The disorder
has an order to it; it is all done according to a far-distant ritual."
<sup><a name="REF95" href="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>
Ponchon's poem is written in response to a news item, inserted as
epigraph to the poem, that society women are forming an anti-Cake-Walk
league. The magazine <i>Le Rire</i> warns: "While there is still time,
before the Cake-Walk obsession has taken over all classes of society,
let it be known that this Negro dance is all the rage; its vogue
reached its apex with the Bals de l'Op&eacute;ra and l'Op&eacute;ra
comique. . . . It's everywhere: at the Bouffes-Parisiennes: 'Floradora';
le cake-walk; Nouveau Cirque: Joyeux n&egrave;gres, le cake-walk;
Op&eacute;ra: 'Siegfried&#8212;5th act,' le cake-walk. . . . [Attend]
the big protest meeting against [the new negro dance], la Mana Negra."
<sup><a name="REF96" href="#FOOT96">96</a></sup>
A month later, it is clearly too late: the Cake-Walk has taken over in
elegant Parisian salons, as the following poem laments.

<b></b>

<p>
In 22 stanzas of "Pavane et Cake-Walk," Jacques Redelsperger contrasts
"the dances of France" with the Cake-Walk. In the former, the cadence
of French dances carried their partners toward the joyful land of
love, and aristocratic ladies reserved their <i>gestes canailles</i>
(naughty gestures) for the bedroom. "Alas, today French brains are
topsy-turvy and the prancing of monkeys has turned the universe upside
down. Hip! Hip! Hourrah! Let's shake our bodies, chimpanzees and female
monkeys, everyone goes at it with his convulsive jolt. . . . The epileptic
Cake-Walk makes us look like broken toys who spin like madmen. You see
them wherever you go . . . sticking out their stomach, juggling with their
members. . . . Any minute, you expect them to climb up into their coconut
palm trees. . . . Oh little society women, keep the waltz and the Boston,
and let this dance be sweated out by the inmates of Charenton."
<sup><a name="REF97" href="#FOOT97">97</a></sup>

<p>
Dancing the Cake-Walk effects an instantaneous evolutionary
regression, and what is most disturbing is the willingness of the
symbol of elegance&#8212;la Parisienne&#8212;to lead the dance. (<A
NAME="9" href="10.4gordon_res.html#9"> 9</a>) What's
more, it makes the French look like madmen, and it should be left to
the insane who are interned in Charenton hospital. In addition to the
agitated kicking, the arched back must have reminded spectators of the
hysterical <i>arc de cercle</i>. And indeed, among the adjectives that
spring to Redelsperger's pen are "epileptic" and "convulsive." What is
new is the emphatic reference to monkeys. And the Cake-Walk spreads to
all levels of Parisian society like a contagious malady.
<sup><a name="REF98" href="#FOOT98">98</a></sup>
Naturally, the concern is that this dance that blurs class and race
boundaries will eventually <i>destroy</i> those distinctions. Result:
<i>everyone</i> will be savages. In an 1899 drawing by Willette,
"How the French are Seen Abroad," a French couple dressed as African
natives are observed with fear and mistrust by other Europeans. (<A
NAME="0" href="10.4gordon_res.html#0"> 10</a>)
The French are <i>already</i> exotic and sexually provocative
in the eyes of their British, German, and Slavic neighbors! The
situation is more dire in this 1901 Willette drawing: (<a name="1"
href="10.4gordon_res.html#1"> 11</a>) the French couple has
truly regressed to a prehistoric stage of humanity: They have become
savages. And the reason is given in the caption: "Parisians, deprived of
the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, return to the life of savages." It
doesn't take much; just take away the clothing of civilization or the
civilizing effects of high culture, and Parisians will revert to a
prehistoric moment in time. Nonetheless, and this has been pointed out
again and again in commentary on the French reception of Josephine Baker
in 1925, regression is also experienced as a sense of liberation. The
exhilaration of seeing and imitating the black body in movement was
already crucial between 1889 and 1904. And the fantasy of regression
was not foreign to the thrill: nostalgia for a more instinctual life is
apparent in the following poem. "By the folds of the brain . . . science
proves to everyone that Man had the Monkey for a father. Madame, at your
service! I'm going to take off my suit, but, for your part, take off your
underwear. Let's return under the coconut trees, where, all day long,
the drunkenness of gorillas is allowed&#8212;Happiness unknown to man."
<sup><a name="REF99" href="#FOOT99">99</a></sup>
Thus, in a 1904 drawing for <i>Le Rire</i>, the French President
Loubet awards the Legion of Honor to a Cake-Walk-dancing chimpanzee,
"creator of our national dance of France," pronouncing these words:
"Who said that the cake-walk was American in origin?" (<a name="2"
href="10.4gordon_res.html#2"> 12</a>)

<p>
The fascination for the rhythms of the black body in dance was very much
akin to the fascination for the crazily frenetic rhythms of the Epileptic
Singer. The Epileptic Singer deliberately foregrounded her strangeness,
and the sexual fantasies that surrounded her were further primitivized
by lending her the traits of an African woman,

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 644]</b>

and by linking her to animals and atavism.
<sup><a name="REF100" href="#FOOT100">100</a></sup>
A famous Epileptic Singer, Emilienne d'Alen&ccedil;on, also
performed with a trained donkey act, and, after years of stardom in
the caf&eacute;-concert, ended life as a concierge. The journalist
interviewing her in 1902 remarked that "You often finish like you
began! . . . Atavism is not a meaningless word."
<sup><a name="REF101" href="#FOOT101">101</a></sup>

<p>
These images constructed in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
built upon in the first decade of the twentieth, are essential
to understanding the public for Josephine Baker and <i>La Revue
N&egrave;gre</i> in 1925. I now want to show how the combination of
clownish postures, of hyper-sexuality, and of "bizarre and charming"
black dance movements were co-opted by white stars.
<p>
When Polaire danced the Cake-Walk, Willy wrote that it had "remained a
dance of epileptic savages&#8212;and like a representation of colic and
the illustration of Vomito N&eacute;gro, until the day that Polaire was
kind enough to dance it on the stage of Les Mathurins."
<sup><a name="REF102" href="#FOOT102">102</a></sup>
This assimilation of epilepsy, blackness, savages and disease jumps off
the page like the leaps of an epileptic dancer off the stage. Willy may
have wanted to distinguish Polaire's performance of the Cake-Walk from
what was repulsive to him in the "[nauseating] epileptic savagery"
of the dance, but in fact Polaire was already associated with the
dark continent.
<sup><a name="REF103" href="#FOOT103">103</a></sup>
One might begin with Raoul Ponchon's 1902 poem entitled "Polaire" which
remonstrates against negative characterizations of the singer. "Despite
the enormous caricature of her by Sem and Cappiello, Polaire is an
exquisite woman. . . . Unfortunately, I don't know if, in addition,
she is Callipyge. . . . she has dark and golden skin. . . . I love the
metallic sound of her laughter and her chaotic gestures."
<sup><a name="REF104" href="#FOOT104">104</a></sup>
The Callipyge Venus in the museum of Naples had exaggeratedly developed
buttocks and, indeed, the caricaturist Sem had made her resemble the
Hottentot Venus. Ponchon's poem was the second in a series of four. One
of Polaire's critics, Hugues Delorme, responded in the following issue
of the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>. Not only does he reiterate the
qualification of callipyge, but in the last quatrain, we find our old
friend, the paragon of ugliness, Mademoiselle Abdala. "You, Ponchon,
adore Polaire?! . . . What a cynical lie! The only heart that your
heart tolerates, is it not that of Abdala? . . . "
<sup><a name="REF105" href="#FOOT105">105</a></sup>
(As we will soon see, Polaire and Abdala not only shared the
black, voracious mouth, but like Abdala, she was viewed as a
Phenomenon.) Polaire herself wrote a response to Ponchon in the
following issue acknowledging his compliments and elaborating on her
female critics as "envious creatures": whatever their name, "they are
always la m&ocirc;me caca!. . . . [and] it is thanks to their grumbling
that I realized how charming my [physique] was."
<sup><a name="REF106" href="#FOOT106">106</a></sup>

<p>
Born in Algeria of an Algerian-born Frenchman, she had "dark skin,
a physique one wasn't accustomed to meet in Paris."
<sup><a name="REF107" href="#FOOT107">107</a></sup>
In her memoirs, <i>Polaire par elle-m&ecirc;me</i>, Polaire writes
"My <i>instincthad me make crazily excited gestures</i>. . . . I sang
. . . with my <i>nostrils flaring</i>, with my <i>fists clenched</i>, and
even with my toes twitching in my shoes. . . . I let my <i>wild mane</i>
go free. . . . I sang bent over backward . . . with <i>nervous</i>,
exasperated movements" (<i>PPEM</i>, 83; emphasis mine). Every part
of Polaire's body, from the contractions of her hands to the tensed-up
members, twitching feet and the <i>arc de cercle ,</i> conforms to the
picture of nineteenth-century hysteria. At the same time, much of the
italicized vocabulary also evokes the savage with equal insistance. The
media seized

<b></b>

upon the image of Polaire as the incarnation of sexual vice, and that
contributed to her meteoric rise to stardom.
<sup><a name="REF108" href="#FOOT108">108</a></sup>
Yet Polaire's image did not only draw on the comparison of the Epileptic
Singer with the prostitute. It reached farther down into the French
psyche. L&eacute;on Nemo and Jules Gondoin wrote that "her capricious
and pretty face of a delicate and perverse little animal is profiled
on the most modern of Parisian horizons."
<sup><a name="REF109" href="#FOOT109">109</a></sup>
Her friend Colette noted that when Polaire was sad, she "leaned her
cheek on her shoulder like those ravishing little monkeys [sold by]
dealers in exotic animals."
<sup><a name="REF110" href="#FOOT110">110</a></sup>
Again we see the attraction of epilepsy and animality. What I want
to try to untangle in these descriptions of gesture in Polaire's
performances is the question of instinct and influence. The source
named by Polaire in her own account of them is "my instinct." From
<i>her</i> instinctual drives came the "nervous movements" and the
"crazily excited gestures." But is this the same instinct that is
called to mind for the readers of <i>Le Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>
in 1894? In her performance at the Ambassadeurs in 1894, she is "a
whirlwind . . . nervous to an excess, her amorous hips with their
crazy twisting, and her legs . . . each is a torpedo sending the
foot flying. With her strident voice, she excels in the fashionable,
nervous, neurotic morbidity. . . . All of this <i>instinctive noise</i>,
<i>incessant stamping</i> and trembling. . . . This, henceforth, is
the <i>genre Polaire</i>."
<sup><a name="REF111" href="#FOOT111">111</a></sup>
One can safely assume that, when nearly three million spectators watched
dancers from Dahomey in that year alone, the words "instinctive" and
"incessant stamping"&#8212;an image underlined by the references to North
Africa in the same article&#8212;brought forth images of African dancers,
while the constellation of "instinctive noise, trembling, nervous
and neurotic" also brought forth the image of hysterics. Nonetheless,
Polaire was (it seems to me) <i>imitating</i>neither African dancers
nor hysterics. On the contrary, she tries to make a case in her memoirs
for the origination of these gestures in her own nervous system. In
the interviews that I cite below, we will see that she also accounts
for a personal, childhood source for the dance movements that resemble
those of Africans. Only 18 years old in 1894, Polaire from that time on
takes credit for "inventing" the genre &eacute;pileptique. In the article
cited above, Jean d'Arc writes that she is "a wildcat whose eyes glimmer
in the Algerian nights with bizarre and wild reflections: she was born
in Algiers&#8212;on the border of dull civilizations [and] the deserts
of liberty." In addition, she has "the breasts of an Alm&eacute;e,"
that is to say, a belly-dancer ("MPAA," 9). Polaire may be "<i>the
most Parisienne</i> among Parisians," but she is nevertheless more the
"daughter of Africa with her languorous eyes brilliant with sunshine,
and the slow lascivious walk of women from down there."
<sup><a name="REF112" href="#FOOT112">112</a></sup>
The oscillation between "<i>the most Parisienne</i>" and the
"daughter of Africa" could not be more important; it is precisely
this undecidability that made Polaire the biggest music-hall star
of her generation. And, along with her "neurotic" traits, it is also
key to her title to modernity, as the earlier reference to the "most
modern of Parisian horizons" attests. In an interview for the magazine
<i>ComoediaIllustrated</i>, Polaire confessed: "I knew I was more strange
than pretty, I felt myself more capable of emotion and passion than of
comedy, what was I doing&#8212;despite the success and money&#8212;on
a music-hall stage?"
<sup><a name="REF113" href="#FOOT113">113</a></sup>
And in a <i>Fantasio</i> interview, after describing her childhood in
Algeria, she claims that she learned the belly dance from Ouled-Nail
nomads while still a child and danced it to enthusiastic

<b></b>

"little Negroes" in the neighborhood. Criticized for her lack of decorum
and unconventional behavior, she explains: "I am a <i>sauvagesse</i>." She
then asks a leading question, but one that we should have no trouble
answering: "the little Savage has not only become a Parisienne, but one
of the most representative silhouettes of Paris, this Paris where all
fashion of paradox becomes reality. How did that happen?"
<sup><a name="REF114" href="#FOOT114">114</a></sup>
The answer will become so obvious that in 1925, no one will have
to ask the question. Her dark skin and her excessively narrow waist
(which accentuated her hips) were the reason that "people insisted on
only seeing me as a Phenomenon (<i>une ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne</i>)"
(<i>PPEM</i>, 10-1). In the context of the music-hall, as I have
noted, the term Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne has a very precise meaning,
akin to "freak." What made Polaire a phenomenon was also her physique,
but&#8212;as we see from her own description&#8212;not only the famous
wasp-waist. She mentions her wild mane twice in her memoirs. She cropped
her hair short&#8212;just above the shoulder&#8212;in 1900: twenty
years before other "liberated" women all rushed out to "bob" their hair
in order to conform to fashion. This and her narrow waist explain her
being billed in America as "The Ugliest Woman in the World," a billing
that confirms the above equation between Phenomenon and freak. (<A
NAME="3" href="10.4gordon_res.html#3"> 13</a>) For
there was a precedent in America for the billing: it was Julia Pastrana,
a bearded Mexican-Indian woman with simian features and "yellow-brown
skin" who sang and danced between 1854 and 1860; Pastrana was also
sometimes billed as a freak, "The Apewoman." Her "hideous" face, as an
1888 commentator described it, was in stark contrast to the grace she
exhibited in dancing Pepitas and flings in short dresses very much like
those worn by singers in France.
<sup><a name="REF115" href="#FOOT115">115</a></sup>
Polaire's involvement in the fascination that Blackness held for
Parisians was not unidirectional: Polaire <i>bought</i> and brought
back a young black man from her American tour, as we learn to our shock
in an article in the magazine <i>Femina</i>. The illustration shows
the smiling sixteen-year-old Jimmy alongside the medallion inscribed
"I belong to Melle Polaire. Please return me to her" that he supposedly
wears around his neck.
<sup><a name="REF116" href="#FOOT116">116</a></sup>

<p>
If, as I suggested earlier, Polaire was intent on underlining the
origins in her own body and in her own childhood for nervous, epileptic
movements, as well as for African dance movements, she nonetheless would
not have been able to stake a personal claim for the black American
Cake-Walk. In the mind of the average French spectator though, there
was a considerable amount of conflation between Africans and black
Americans. Did Polaire's Cake-Walk express her own identity, or did it
mime the fantasized identification of her public? A review of a musical at
the Moulin-Rouge, "The Belle of New York," notes the irresistible desire
on the part of spectators: "You will split your sides laughing. The
night of the premiere, the spectators were so delighted by the play,
so worked up and carried along by the extraordinary movement which is
the characteristic of this genre of spectacle that some of them left
dancing the jig <i>involuntarily</i>, while others were carried away
and executed steps of the cakewalk."
<sup><a name="REF117" href="#FOOT117">117</a></sup>
The reviewer also remarks that the "perpetual jigs make one
think that all of the characters are afflicted with the St. Vitus
Dance." The space of performance is an exchange between performer and
audience&#8212;particularly in the caf&eacute;-concerts and music-halls
where audience participation was firmly implanted from the beginning in

<b></b>

these sites. Moreover, the intensity and specificity of this exchange in
late nineteenth-century Paris was colored by the dynamics of unconscious
imitation that I have discussed elsewhere. When racial identifications are
inserted into this exchange, the dynamics are complicated further. To cite
W. T. Lhamon, "when a gesture comes to stand for someone other than its
apparent originator, what is the meaning? How does it happen? . . . Maybe
marketing of gestures exhibited this complexity of cultural property:
that it was saleable but never exclusive property. You could buy it and
you could

<b></b>

sell it, but you could not own it. Maybe the step took over the stepper,
an inversion analogous to the tail wagging the dog." Lhamon is writing
about black slaves and freemen in New York's Catharine market who were
"dancing out their identity, and. . . . increasingly . . . the identities
of their publics, who paid them for their gestures."
<sup><a name="REF118" href="#FOOT118">118</a></sup>
He is attempting to trace the evolution of gesture from these street
performances of the 1820s to the mid-century blackface minstrel shows,
and he is using the wheeling gesture as a gestural touchstone. I find
his remarks very pertinent to performances of the Cake-Walk at the
turn-of-the-century, whose gestural touchstones are the arched back and
the high kicking strut. What has been exchanged between Polaire and her
public? The fascination that the energy of black bodies in movement
holds for the French has been incorporated into Polaire's person,
thanks to her physique, her movements, and to the media.
<sup><a name="REF119" href="#FOOT119">119</a></sup>
The attraction that the image of blackness holds, as it is seen and
fantasized, is now packaged in a product with white skin that can be
openly enjoyed by the masses.
<sup><a name="REF120" href="#FOOT120">120</a></sup>
Polaire has managed the aesthetic creation of a type removed from the
real thing. Thus, Willy was able to write that until she danced the
Cake-Walk, it had "remained a dance of epileptic savagery and Vomito
Negro." Still, the residual feelings of fear and repulsion are present
and Polaire was the first to feel their sting. Polaire's short hair was
a striking and brazen example of her Amazon-like nature; she wrote that
people found her short hair disgusting, and petulant, she insistently
repeated that her "wild mane" <i>was not</i> in fact naturally
curly. When she appeared at Les Ambassadeurs in the early 1890s,
already a star, she became fodder for humorists and caricaturists. "Sem,
whom all his colleagues soon imitated, represented me with a ring in
my nose and the black curls of a <i>N&eacute;gresse</i>. Always the
same error about my hair: it was neither black nor curly. . . . Sem
ornamented my body with enough rotundities to put the Hottentot Venus
to shame!" (<i>PPEM</i>, 93).
<sup><a name="REF121" href="#FOOT121">121</a></sup>
(<a name="4" href="10.4gordon_res.html#4"> 14</a>)
Photographs of Polaire show her to have dark, wavy hair, but the
caricaturist's transformation is easily understood: he is simply
completing a picture of sexuality and Phenomenon that includes
Blackness. Polaire may not have known why people always made the mistake,
but we do: epileptic contortions and fever-pitched sexuality immediately
brought associations with blackness. In the text that accompanies this
image, Sem accuses contemporary couturiers of pathologizing fashion:
"the processions of disarticulated manikins (resemble) a music-hall
extravaganza" producing "scenes of modern hysteria" and "moral
perversion" where the only thing missing is "the <i>N&eacute;gresse</i>."
<sup><a name="REF122" href="#FOOT122">122</a></sup>
However, she is not missing for long: women dressed in these fashions
look like "female savages decorated with talismans. . . . Papous from New
Caledonia with dyed manes, (and) troglodytes." Yet "the supreme horror"
is a real, not an imagined savage, a cannibal: "a cannibal with frizzy
hair . . . her body strangulated, almost cut in half . . . a ring in
her nose, the mouth dripping with blood and split open from ear to
ear. . . . "
<sup><a name="REF123" href="#FOOT123">123</a></sup>
The cannibal is none other than Polaire. This weave of images&#8212;the
music-hall, dance as hysteria, pathology as fashion, vice, the savage
<i>N&eacute;gresse</i>, evolutionary regression past (Troglodytes) and
present (Africa, New Caledonia)&#8212;is the one I have been elaborating
upon in this study. What we must note, though, is its tenacity, for Sem
is writing in 1914. By then, this cluster of associations has become a
clich&eacute;, a clich&eacute;, moreover, that Josephine Baker's 1925
debut will

<b></b>

exploit to its fullest. Polaire's extraordinary appeal as the incarnation
of Vice must also include the "<i>N&eacute;gresse's</i> sexual savagery,"
and I venture to say that she knew that very well. Now that we have
seen the image of the Hottentot Venus spring to Polaire's mind, we
can be certain that the term "Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne" did not occur
innocently in her memoirs. For in fact, the first female Phenomenon to be
exhibited in Paris in the nineteenth century was none other than Sartjie
Baartman. It was not for nothing that Polaire and another dark-haired
Epileptic Singer, Eug&eacute;nie Foug&egrave;re, a Spanish Jew, were the
first white stars to dance the Cake-Walk in Paris. Foug&egrave;re was
described as "na&iuml;ve et sauvage," and when she returned to the stage
in 1920 after a long hiatus (in a musical revue with none other than
Polaire), she appeared "in the costume of an American Negro." At least
in this original fantasy, she told an interviewer, "I felt my old self

<b></b>

again." The incorporation of blackness by this white singer suggests that
the motivations for adopting a black persona and the effects of such a
mascarade might have gone beyond the purposes of simple exploitation.
<sup><a name="REF124" href="#FOOT124">124</a></sup>
Essentially making the Cake-Walk a variant of her own style, the bawdy
female caf&eacute;-concert performer encouraged the oblique aura of
racial attributes that already hovered around her to become a more
explicit part of her persona.
<p>
Contained in this aura was an extraordinary sense of liberation from the
layers of inhibition imposed by societal conventions and taboos against
bodily abandon; freedom, too, from rejections of images of illness,
deformity, and ugliness. This "return of the repressed"&#8212;marked
as inherent to "primitive" peoples and, at the same time, as symptom
of epilepsy and hysteria&#8212;was facilitated by the form of popular
spectacle invented by the "animalistically aggressive" singers I have
described here. Discussing the mirror held up by the media, Mary Russo
has written that grotesque representations of women, the disabled, and
sexual and racial minorities offer one the chance to "parade in these fun
house mirrors [and to] surrender one's identity as no longer possibly
correct, recognizable, . . . but inevitably bound to other bodies and
strange selves."
<sup><a name="REF125" href="#FOOT125">125</a></sup>
This dynamic is akin to Freud's Uncanny and is precisely the one at
work in the Parisian spectators' experience of the Epileptic Singer, the
minstrel, and the African dancer. Freud writes, "we see in epilepsy and
madness the workings of forces hitherto unexpected" and dimly perceived
"in a remote category of [one's] own being."
<sup><a name="REF126" href="#FOOT126">126</a></sup>
This is clearly a dynamic that thrilled spectators in the electrified,
nervous ambience of the Music Hall.
<sup><a name="REF127" href="#FOOT127">127</a></sup>
For the more sophisticated members of the public, this liberation
was not only that of the body, but that of the mind and senses: those
spectators sensed that they were experiencing a new art form.
<p>
Picasso's 1907 "Demoiselles d'Avignon" explicitly joined African masks to
prostitution (and syphilis) and moved these fantasies about the primitive
onto the stage of High Art at the same time that the musical purveyors
of the primitive were leaving the stages of popular entertainment. Two
decades later, black primitivism would be incarnated by Josephine Baker,
and the aggressive, animalistic dislocations of the Epileptic Singers'
bodies would be definitively forgotten.

H. T. Sampson dates the first black minstrels in London in February
1870; they were followed by Hick's Original Georgia Minstrels in July
1870. The earliest examples of minstrelsy in Paris that I have been able
to date are: the Mannon Sontargs who presented musical numbers, burlesque
sketches, dances and acrobatics, ending with a comic monologue by one of
the endmen, "considered to be a marvel of grotesque humor" (1875-1880;
in Alan Weill, <i>Exposition Chaumont 1993: Jazz, pop, rock</i> [Paris:
Somogy, 1993], 29). In 1877 at the Alcazar d'Hiver, Armand Ben introduced
the character of the black Dandy, a parody of white nouveaux riches. The
following year, Jilson and Reed, billed as Burlesque Negroes&#8212;a
name that will stick to the end of the century, performed at the same
venue. By the 1880s, a new caf&eacute;-concert genre had emerged called
"Les Exotiques," American and Englishmen in blackface.

The director of the zoological Gardens was the celebrated evolutionist,
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The spectacle of fourteen Nubians going about the
activities of daily life in the Paris Jardin d'acclimatation was a huge
commercial success. Around thirty such exhibits followed up until 1912,
and enjoyed the same success. These are the years of French colonial
expansion (1870-1910) during the Third Republic. The 1881 Terra del
Fuego exhibit in Paris drew over 50,000 visitors on a single Sunday
(the natives of Terra del Fuego had the distinction of being designated
by Darwin as the lowest form of the human race). Only the very briefest
sketch of these exhibits is given here; the reader is referred to the
work of Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard, Laurent Gervereau, <i>Images

Henri de Weindel, "Black Charm" <i>Fantasio</i> (1 September 1906),
100. The allure continues to hold fast in reviews of Josephine Baker's
performances. Nancy Cunard described the "cannibal beauty." Parallels
with Epileptic Singers are rife: "the little savage of the early days
with her delirious, grotesque dances" (Cunard, <i>Negro</i> [1934; New
York: Negro Universities Press, 1969], 329). In those early days, Pierre
de R&eacute;gnier asked: "Is it a man? . . . Is it a woman? . . . the
voice is high-pitched, she is in a perpetual tremble. . . . this dance of
rare indecency is the triumph of lubricity" (cited in Sieglinde Lemke,
<i>Primitivist Modernism</i> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998],
99). These examples are far from being the only ones that demonstrate an
extraordinary similarity between perceptions of the Epileptic Singers and
perceptions of Josephine Baker (whose dancing was labeled epileptic by
two journalists reviewing the premiere of <i>La Revue n&egrave;gre</i>),
explored in greater detail in my book in progress, <i>Backstage at the

The Cake-Walk originated on ante-bellum Southern plantations as a
parody of the Master's dances by the slaves who danced it. The original
parodic nature of the dance was unknown to French audiences and to
white performers. It is thus ironic that the Cake-Walk has been seen
as a display of black, regressive traits, and doubly ironic that the
white imitation of a black dance imitating upper-class white dancers
should be labeled dangerous in regard to unconscious imitation and
contagion. Moreover, the specific <i>type</i> of Cake-Walk that was
imported into France was not the more graceful walk around, but the
type known in America as the comic or eccentric Cake-Walk (documents
of both examples can be found in the film archives at the Library of
Congress). The Cake-Walk was first presented in a white musical production
in the United States in 1883, and by 1898, according to Tom Fletcher,
"all of the big colored shows and black minstrel companies featured it"
(cited in Jean and Marshall Sterns, <i>Jazz Dance: The Story of American
Vernacular Dance</i> [New York: Da Capo Press, 1994]).

The Elks were white Cake-Walk dancers, while the other couples were
black. Like Cocteau, the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> reviewer focused
on the Elks. "Of the couples who stood out the most, the Elks were
peerless; their science of choreography, the diversity of the poses and
the elegance of the postures caused a sensation" ("Au Nouveau-Cirque,"

The wild Bal des Quat'z Arts thrown annually by the students of the
&Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts ended in spectacular fashion in 1903: on 25
April, five hundred drunken and dancing revelers descended from the Butte
Montmartre back to the school on the rue Bonaparte. There "they burned a
black-tinted mannequin who had first been pierced through several times
with a lance. This Negro was none other than Mr. Cake-Walk, to whom the
Ecole des Beaux-Arts has just given the coup de gr&acirc;ce" (Paul Delay
in the <i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i> [3 May 1903], 4). In fact, several
new dances were introduced in 1903 in an attempt to replace the Cake-Walk.
<p>
The Nouveau-Cirque, who had launched the black dance phenomenon in Paris
now tried to top the colossal success of the Cake-Walk, opening its
1904 season with "Modern-Sports," a nautical pantomime with new American
dances. "The two new dances are to the Cake-Walk what poetry is to prose,
the Boston-Ball and the Trans-Atlantique (which) possess as much fantasy,
but have much more charm, elegance, and correct manners. . . . exquisite
amusements and which are in good taste" (<i>Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais</i>
[3 January 1904], 8). These dances did not achieve the success of the
Cake-Walk. Thus, in 1905, the Nouveau-Cirque brought back the <i>Joyeux
N&egrave;gres</i> revue, calling it "The Joyous Negroes with the Real
Cake-Walk," just to remind the public that everything began here, and
other venues had only copies, not the true article. Over 400 performances
of the <i>Joyeux N&egrave;gres</i> had failed to dampen their enormous
success. The 1905 show contained several new attractions, including
Foottit and Chocolat hilariously performing the dance. But notice
how the criticism has softened into unmitigated praise: "The public
again enjoyed watching this show whose charm is so picturesque and so
thrilling: surprised and amused once again, they took pleasure in the
primitive and engaging poetry of this choreography, sometimes strange,
but with a vivacity, a fantasy, and a gaiety without equal. . . . [It is]
an amusement that is unique in all the world. The enthusiastic public
applauded, and frenetically cried Bravo! and Encore!" (<i>Courrier
Fran&ccedil;ais</i> [16 March 1905], 4).

Sem was not immune to the unconscious imitation I have underlined
elsewhere in spectatorship: Cocteau observed Sem drawing or "biting

<i>Portraits-souvenir</i>, 88). The caricaturist himself was transformed
by another artist a few years later: Paul Colin, in the 1927 album of
45 colored lithographs, <i>Le Tumulte noir</i> (Paris: Succ&egrave;s
editions, 1927). Colin's depiction shows him so much under the influence
of "Negromania" that he has regressed to become a monkey.

The intense fascination in France for the black Other may well carry a
specificity in addition to that of colonialism. The emotions aroused
by the performances I have discussed must have included a tension
between the ideal of republican Universalism in the third republic and
this Other which seemed impossible to assimilate. This is an aspect I
have not undertaken to explore here, but which certainly merits more
reflection. I would like to thank the members of the history symposium
at the University of Georgia, Athens, the colloquium of the Department
of Modern and Classical Languages at the University of Connecticut,
and Rutgers University faculty members for their valuable comments
when versions of this paper were read. Thanks also to Tammy Berberi, my
research assistant in May 2001 at the Biblioth&egrave;que de l'Arsenal
for her excellent work, and finally to the University of Connecticut
Research Foundation for the grant I received for this research.
