<p>
T. S. Eliot arrived in London by mischance in August 1914, forced here
by the German declaration of war, just as he had begun his study of
German philosophy at the University of Marburg. He would have preferred
a landing in Paris, where he had spent an earlier academic year at the
Sorbonne; he was being trained in the mind of Europe at Harvard, and his
previous travels, especially in Italy, had further shaped his European
sensibility. In the growing cultural chaos, however, an uncertain route
to England became his one, fortuitous avenue of escape. He took refuge
in Merton College and began reading philosophy to fulfill the spirit of
his travelling fellowship. At the end of the year, he took the first
step of self-imposed exile&#8212;his unannounced marriage to Vivien
Haigh Wood&#8212;and briefly returned alone to the family summer home in
Gloucester, Massachusetts, to inform his parents that he was abandoning
a career in philosophy at Harvard for a literary career in London. After
suffering a withering rebuke, he agreed that the precipitous cancellation
of his fellowship was one of his "blunders" and duly promised to complete
his doctoral dissertation.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Upon his safe and permanent return to London, where Vivien had been
 left in the care and company of Bertrand Russell, Eliot began to unpack
 the intellectual baggage that he brought to England from America:
 a few respected authors (Poe, Hawthorne, Henry James), his masters
 at Harvard (Josiah Royce and Irving Babbitt), those he needed to set
 himself up as a practicing poet and literary critic



and to exercise an almost intact vision of culture and its relation to
humanism and religion. Others have examined the importance of Eliot's
American luggage in England, but much has remained lost in the attic. So I
want to spend an hour rummaging in Eliot's attic, tracing his definition
and defense of culture in relation to some American intellectuals with
opposing ideas of culture. In the process, I feel obliged to address
the widespread presumption that his writings are anti-Semitic, first by
reconstructing the lost contexts of "Burbank with a Baedeker" and "Dirge"
and  <i>After Strange Gods</i>, and then by bringing out of the attic a
fugitive intellectual whose relationship to Eliot may radically reform
our perception of Eliot as a critic of Judaeo-Christian culture in Europe.

<p>
The first re that Eliot removed from his steamer trunk was Ralph
Waldo Emerson, Unitarian minister, Transcendentalist philosopher,
champion of the democratic spirit, and hero of nineteenth-century
American literature and culture. Eliot's grandfather, the Unitarian
preacher William Greenleaf Eliot, had met Emerson; his mother and members
of his extended St. Louis and Boston families revered him; but to Eliot
he was the romantic embodiment of everything he wanted to exile himself
from in America&#8212;religious liberalism, individualism, optimism,
sentimentalism. In Eliot's view, the Emersonian-Unitarian philosophy had
infected his family and the whole of New England, particularly Boston,
and especially Harvard University; it had led to "the Boston doubt," a
scepticism, he wrote "which is difficult to explain to those who are not
born to it. This scepticism is a product, or a cause, or a concomitant,
of Unitarianism; it is not destructive, but it is dissolvent."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Emerson's Unitarian virus, working on a weakened strain of New England
 Puritanism, had transformed itself into Transcendentalism, and a young
 Eliot found the blanched, dissolvent morality abhorrent. "In the Puritan
 morality that I remember," he wrote, "it was tacitly assumed that if
 one was thrifty, enterprising, intelligent, practical and prudent
 in not violating social conventions, one ought to have a happy and
 'successful' life. Failure was due to some weakness or perversity
 peculiar to the individual; but the decent man need have no nightmares."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
The new London resident and bridegroom was equally concerned that
Emerson's philosophy had worked its corrosive effects on the cultural
and social theories of English writers&#8212;Carlyle, Ruskin, Arnold,
and others. "I was brought up in an environment of that intellectual and
puritanical rationalism which is found in the novels of George Eliot,"
he wrote scornfully. "Herbert Spencer's generalized theory of evolution
was in my childhood environment regarded as the key to the mystery of
the universe."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Arnold, who had praised Emerson for his "holding fast to happiness and
 hope," was in Eliot's eyes the English Emerson, so in the late summer
 of 1915, when he began to amuse himself with poems satirical of Boston
 culture and its "modern" ideas, he could not resist the temptation to
 train his scathing satirical eye on the bookshelves of Cousin Nancy's
 sitting room:
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 "Upon the glazen shelves kept watch/ Matthew and Waldo, guardians of
 the faith,/ The army of unalterable law."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Already we see a severe cultural critic and caricaturist at work in his
 poems; in time, he would learn how to bring a more ferocious English
 humor to his caricature of cultural antagonists.

<p>
It should not be surprising, then, to discover that when Eliot began
teaching his three-year Extension course for the University of London
he regularly discussed three

<b></b>

of his Victorian subjects, Arnold, Carlyle, and Ruskin, in relation to
Emerson, comparing them as moralists and social reformers, contrasting
their attitudes toward Christianity, and assigning Arnold's <i>Culture
and Anarchy</i>, Ruskin's <i>Stones of Venice</i><i>,</i> Carlyle's
<i>Heroes and Hero Worship</i>.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 He also had his students read J. M. Robertson's <i>Modern Humanists:
 Sociological Studies of Carlyle, Mill, Emerson, Arnold, Ruskin and
 Spencer</i>,for the theme of Eliot's course was that of Robertson:
 these were false prophets of religion and culture.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 So central had Emerson become to Eliot's discussions of cultural
 theories that when he resumed the course for the second year he
 placed Emerson first on the syllabus, apprising his students of
 the religious and philosophical environment of New England, taking
 them through the tenets of Unitarianism and Transcendentalism, and
 extending the comparison with English social philosophers, who now
 included William Morris and Walter Pater. He had them read Emerson's
 <i>Essays</i><i>,</i> <i>Nature</i>, and <i>The Conduct of Life</i>,
 further directing them to Emerson's ten-volume <i>Journal</i> "to obtain
 a more intimate knowledge of the man" (<i>EDA</i>, 41, 43). Emerson
 had confusedly attempted to make man as much the measure of all
 things as God, so when Eliot came to draw his post-erectile portrait
 of Sweeney in "Sweeney Erect," he delighted in holding up Emerson's
 philosophy for a touch of comic ridicule: "(The lengthened shadow of
 a man/ Is history, said Emerson/ Who had not seen the silhouette/ Of
 Sweeney straddled in the sun)" (<i>CPP</i>, 26). Emerson's cohorts,
 such as Edward Tyrrell Channing, the Boylston Professor at Harvard,
 were also fair game for poetry, so when he wrote his priapic portrait
 of Bertrand Russell in "Mr. Apollinax," he included in the Boston tea
 party, in animal caricature, Professor and Mrs. "Channing-Cheetah"
 (<i>CPP</i>, 18). Comic and biting satire aside, the gravity of what
 Eliot was telling his students is evident in his review of a history
 of American literature in 1919: "Neither Emerson nor any of the others
 was a real observer of the moral life."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
The American philosophers who stood behind Eliot's criticism of
modern culture were Irving Babbitt and Josiah Royce, both of whom
formed the necessary antipode to Unitarianism and Jamesian pragmatism
at Harvard. Babbitt's anti-Rousseauistic, anti-humanitarian analysis of
the disintegration of western culture since the Renaissance, and Royce's
application of his absolute idealism to the problems of Christianity
in the modern world, had an intellectual impact on Eliot that even now
has not been fully estimated. With Babbitt he had followed literary and
intellectual traditions in France; it was Babbitt who sent him to the
Sorbonne, who taught him how to diagnose and attack the foundations of
secularism. With Royce he had explored philosophies of the absolute;
it was Royce who directed him to F. H. Bradley and who subsequently
judged his dissertation on Bradley's philosophy "the work of an expert"
(<i>L</i>, 142). Though an examination of their ideas of cultural
degeneration and reconstruction is beyond the scope of this essay,
the tenets and effects of their teaching are evident in Eliot's use
of Emerson, Arnold, and others as cultural straw men after he arrived
in London. In their shadows, Eliot had begun his rout of free-thinking
humanists in his new country. Toward his own reconstructive ends, the
American exile began moving as deliberately as possible, through the
<i>Egoist</i>, the <i>Athenaeum</i>, and eventually the <i>Criterion</i>,
to station himself at the center of English culture.

<b></b>

<p>
If Arnold's substitution of poetry for religion as a cultural stay had
become anathema to the young critic, he nonetheless kept at heart the
guiding concern of Arnold's <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>&#8212;the necessary
conjunction of Hebraic and Hellenic traditions in modern culture. Indeed,
as he formulated his idea of tradition and the "historical sense"
under the influence of Babbitt and Royce, he worked with a sharp
awareness of the major compounds of European history&#8212;Graeco-Roman,
Judaeo-Christian, Old-New Testament&#8212;and, as his poetry shows,
he had learned to read the map of Europe as a palimpsest of cultural
and religious change. Thus, his most exciting literary discovery
for representing cultural history in art came from his reading of the
Ireland-Israel odyssey of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, as chapters
of Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> began to appear in the <i>Little Review</i>
in the spring and summer of 1918. Not only the techniques and motifs, but
the crudity&#8212;"justified by exploitation to the point of greatness"
Eliot wrote&#8212;had an immediate impact on his own poetry.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 At the end of the summer, the <i>Little Review</i> published, together
 with the "Hades" chapter of <i>Ulysses</i>, four strikingly new
 poems by Eliot: "Dans Le Restaurant," where we suddenly encounter
 the striking image of a drowned Phoenician, the Semitic Phlebas;
 "Sweeney Among the Nightingales" and "Mr. Eliot's Sunday Morning
 Service," where we meet a crude new protagonist, Sweeney, moving from
 a menacing brothel scene to a Bloom-like contemplation in a bathtub of
 "the masters of the subtle schools"; and "Whispers of Immortality,"
 where the horrific sexual visions and dry-rib metaphysics of Webster
 and Donne are set against the sexual allurement and bosomy bliss
 promised by an exotic if not erotic Grishken. In succeeding months
 these poems would be followed by "Burbank with a Baedeker," "Sweeney
 Erect," and "Gerontion," poems in which a procession of European and
 American gentiles and Jews are paraded into a searing poetic light. To
 comprehend the dramatic change and new cast of characters we must
 look beyond Joyce to some devastating developments in Eliot's life:
 the discovery of Vivien's adultery with Russell at their shared cottage
 in Marlow and the mounting effects of the war.

<p>
Eliot had heard horrifying stories of the war from his nineteen-year-old
brother-in-law Maurice, who returned from the front in France to describe
the necessity of shooting rats in the trenches at night. "What he tells
about rats and vermin is incredible," Eliot reported to his mother,
"Northern France is swarming, and the rats are big as cats" (<i>L</i>,
121). When Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken in January 1916 about the death
of his Paris friend Jean Jules Verdenal in the Dardanelles, he and
Vivien had become "very blue about the war" (<i>L</i>, 125), and as
Eliot suffered further shocks and losses the effect on his sensibility
intensified. Less than a fortnight before Verdenal's death Rupert Brooke
had died in the Aegean. In March 1917, he wrote to his brother: "The
world seems a complete nightmare at times, nothing that could happen
would be surprising. I wonder if there will ever come a time when we
shall look back and find that the period we are living through seems
quite unreal in retrospect" (<i>L</i>, 172). "I have been living in one
of Dostoevsky's novels," he wrote to his cousin. "If I have not seen
the battle field, I have seen other strange things . . . it all seems
like a dream" (<i>L</i>, 189). By the spring of 1918, the unreality of
his betrayed marriage had intensified his nightmare and fuelled

<b></b>

his failed attempt to get a commission in Army or Navy Intelligence. "I
feel very old at present," he told his brother, "and mentally quite
exhausted" (<i>L</i>, 250), as if he were writing out of the persona of
"Gerontion," then in composition. In the midst of his psychological
exhaustion, Eliot suddenly began to transform the nightmare of his
life into an extended phantasmagoria in his art. Phlebas, Sweeney,
Rachel ne&eacute;Rabinovitch, the yet-to-be-named Mrs. Porter, and
Grishken were followed by a European gallery of ethnic highbrows and
lowlifes&#8212;Mr. Silvero, Madame de Tornquist, Hakagawa, Fr&auml;ulein
von Kulp, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, Doris, Burbank, Bleistein, Princess
Volupine, and all the rest. Several characters begin to move freely from
poem to poem as though we the readers must know them intimately: Phlebas,
Sweeney, Mrs. Porter, Fresca and Bleistein reappear in <i>The Waste
Land</i> or its canceled drafts, with Sweeney and Mrs. Porter casually
displacing Acteon and Diana as mythical counterparts in the Unreal
City. By then Eliot could draw on the phantasmal world of Joyce's "Circe"
for the original opening of the poem, and he extended the unreality
to <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i>, to the twilight kingdom of <i>The Hollow
Men</i>, and to the disconnected fragments of "Doris's Dream Songs."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 On an early draft of <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i> he appended from the
 letters of Junius an epigraph meant to characterize the fictional
 companions through whom he expressed his convictions about the world:
 "These are the companions of a disturbed imagination; the melancholy
 madness of poetry, without the inspiration."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
Meanwhile, in the real world at Lloyds Bank, under the pavement of
Lombard Street, Eliot's convictions were being trampled by the former
Professor/President of Princeton, now President Woodrow Wilson, who
was directing the peace process toward the Treaty of Versailles in
June 1919. He had approved of Wilson's policies during the war and
hoped that the Democratic party would survive long enough "to see the
satisfaction of the peace negotiations along Wilson lines" (<i>L</i>,
264). But as he worked on "Sweeney Erect," "Burbank," and "Gerontion,"
Eliot became utterly dismayed by the peace negotiations and believed
that the European powers took advantage of Wilson. It was "a bad peace,"
he told his mother. "And I believe that Wilson made a grave mistake in
coming to Europe" (<i>L</i>, 337). The Treaty became for Eliot a terribly
discouraging symbolic moment in the continuing dissolution of European
unity, in which he had invested life's blood. He was horrified by what
he saw happening to ethnic groups as territorial boundaries were redrawn
by the Treaty. Wilson's whole conception of a new world society governed
by the "self-determination of the peoples," was characterized, Eliot
believed, by Rousseauistic humanitarianism, Emersonian self-reliance,
American sentimentalism of the most naive kind. To Eliot, Wilson's idea of
peace was an idea which disregarded the <i>unity</i> of European culture,
an idea that foisted the excesses of religious liberalism and American
idealism on the nation-states of Europe. So strong was his criticism of
Wilson that he used him as an analogue in his sardonic literary criticism
of Vachel Lindsay, writing in his "London Letter" to the <i>Dial</i>
that Lindsay's "Y.M.C.A. morality represents something more remote
than a massacre in Armenia," and that though his verses have appeared
in an English periodical "I cannot believe that he is treated with
more respect than that with which Clemenceau and Lloyd George bonified
President Wilson."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
In August, desperate to get out of London, he broke away from the bank
in a state of emotional extremity to meet Pound in southern France for
a walking tour of the Dordogne, carrying with him the manuscript of
"Gerontion," whose persona is a haunted, Tiresias-like re who has
witnessed but not fought in all the wars, an exhausted persona lost
in the labyrinthine corridors of history, waiting for a redemptive
sign. The manuscript still carried a dropped epigraph from Dante's
<i>Inferno</i>, where Friar Albergio reveals that his soul is dead and
damned even though his body is alive on earth. When asked, "Are you
already dead?" he replies, "Just how my body is in the world above,
I have no way of knowing" (XXXIII, 122-23). As he gazed at the wave
pattern carved into a stone wall at the castle in Excidueil, Eliot
cried out in Pound's hearing, "I am afraid of the life after death,"
and in La Cath&eacute;dral Saint-Front in P&eacute;rigueux he suffered
the second vastation since learning of the infidelity in Marlow.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 "This sense of dispossession by the dead I have known twice," he later
 remarked of his state of mind, "at Marlow and at P&eacute;rigueux."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 After his return to the bank he immersed himself in John Maynard
 Keynes' <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</i> , in which
 Keynes, too, saw Wilson's temperament in Versailles as more that of a
 Presbyterian theocrat than that of a statesman&#8212;an "important book"
 Eliot told his mother (<i>L</i>, 353), as he began dealing with the war
 reparations dictated by the Treaty of Versailles. The consequences of
 the Treaty continued to prey upon his mind. "I hope it will not prevent
 America from helping in Central Europe," he wrote to her, especially
 mindful of the plight of thousands of Hasidic Jews who had migrated to
 Vienna to join the Jewish population there when Galicia and Bukovina
 were taken over by Russia and Rumania during the German surrender;
 "the destitution, especially the starvation in Vienna, appears to
 be unspeakable. I suppose Americans realise now what a fiasco the
 reorganisation of nationalities has been: the 'Balkanisation' of
 Europe" (<i>L</i>, 351). The revenge-seeking Succession States of
 the Austro-Hungarian Empire had severely restricted food shipments
 to the once-imperial city. A fortnight later he wrote to her again:
 "The American professors must be having a very bad time. I wonder if
 America realises how terrible the condition of central Europe is. I
 can never quite put Vienna out of my mind. And I have seen people who
 have been in Germany and they are most pessimistic about the future,
 not only of Germany, but of the world. They say that there is no hope
 unless the treaty is revised" (<i>L</i>, 353).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
In worsening health, Eliot turned his disturbed poetic faculties to
<i>The Waste Land</i>and his nightmare vision of the "Falling towers"
of European civilization: "Jerusalem Athens Alexandria/ Vienna London/
Unreal" (<i>CPP</i>, 48). When E. M. Foster astutely reviewed the poem as
one of extraordinary horror brought on by the war, Eliot wrote to him with
a Gerontion-like guilt over his non-participation: "You are right about
the 'horror' . . . I only think that you exaggerate the importance of the
War in this context. The War crippled me as it did everyone else; but me
chiefly because it was something I was neither honestly in nor honestly
out of, but the Waste Land might have been just the same without the War."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 What Forster had not seen was that the poem was also driven by the
 "cauldron of unholy loves" (<i>CPP</i>, 53) that had fired his poems
 since 1918.

<p>
So I return to the heart of Eliot's phantasma in 1919, the worst year
of his life,

<b></b>

though in May he took some pleasure in Leonard Woolf's publication
of the <i>Little Review</i> poemsat the Hogarth Press. Eliot had read
the poems to the Woolfs the previous autumn before sending copies for
consideration. To Virginia, the meaning of the difficult poems had to
be dragged up from "the depths of silence."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Since its initial appearance in the <i>Little Review</i>, "Sweeney
 Among the Nightingales" had been given a new, short-lived epigraph
 ("Why should I speak of the nightingale?/ The nightingale sings of
 adulterous wrong").
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 He had placed two new poems,"Burbank with a Baedeker" and
 "Sweeney Erect," with Sidney Schiff, literary editor of <i>Art and
 Letters</i><i>,</i> and he was making arrangements with his friend
 John Rodker, who had succeeded Pound as literary editor of the
 <i>Little Review</i>, to bring out a collection of his poems at
 Rodker's Ovid Press<i>.</i> Toward that prospect, he sent Rodker
 "Burbank," "Sweeney Erect," and "Ode," for his commentary. Let us
 remember who these men were as we move around Eliot's attic. Both
 Rodker and Schiff were members of an Anglo-Jewish community of writers
 and artists that included Jacob Isaacs, Mark Gertler, Ada Leverson,
 and others in East London and Bloomsbury circles, and the Eliots moved
 in their company. Isaacs, an admiring critic of Eliot's work and his
 companion at the music halls, wrote that "if I have done nothing else
 for literature, I did at least take Mr. Eliot to see Mr. Ernie Lotinga
 at the Islington Empire."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Both Rodker and Schiff had introduced Eliot to the poems of Isaac
 Rosenberg, who had fallen at the Somme the previous April. When Rodker
 announced the death of the twenty-seven-year old poet in the <i>Little
 Review,</i>he described it as "a greater loss to poetry in this country
 than any death during the war."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Schiff would feature Rosenberg and Eliot together in the summer issue
 of <i>Art and Letters</i>, publishing five of Rosenberg's poems,
 a drawing, and his sister's obituary on the pages preceding Eliot's
 "Burbank" and "Sweeney Erect," and Eliot was ever after a champion of
 Rosenberg's poems.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Eliot then sent drafts of "Gerontion" to Rodker and Schiff, asking
 for their candid opinions. "I am appreciative of your careful study
 of 'Gerontion,'" Eliot wrote in reply to Schiff, thanking him for
 his commentary, "and shall be glad always to hear anything further
 you may have to say about it" (<i>L</i>, 324)<i>.</i> "'Bleistein,'"
 he told Mary Hutchinson, "(like 'S[weeney] among the Nightingales')
 is meant to be <i>veryserious</i>!"(<i>L</i>, 311), an emphasis he
 reiterated to his brother when Rodker published the poems in <i>Ara
 Vos Prec</i>: "Some of the new poems, the Sweeney ones, especially
 'Among the Nightingales' and 'Burbank' are intensely serious, and I
 think these two are among the best that I have ever done." He went
 on prophetically: "But even here I am considered by the ordinary
 Newspaper critic as a Wit or satirist, and in America I suppose I
 shall be thought merely disgusting" (<i>L</i>, 363)<i>.</i>
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 When we look upon these relationships and exchanges and realize that
 the readers and publishers of Eliot's allegedly anti-Semitic poems were
 Jews, and when we consider Eliot's state of mind during the months of
 composition, do we really want to believe that a dominant motive in
 the poetry was to exercise a little gratuitous anti-Semitism in the
 face of his Jewish friends? How might the poems be thought "intensely
 serious" rather than "merely disgusting"?
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
Eliot's brother Henry had his own sense of what Eliot was trying to do
in these poems and later wanted to write an open letter to a periodical
about the surrealism in

<b></b>

them, but he eschewed the role of embarrassing brother. He wrote to his
friend Harry Harvey: "It's there, sticking out like a barber pole, but
no critic has touched it. . . . TSE's short earlier poems are certainly
partly inspired by Picasso (et al). I think he is one of the earliest
surrealist poets. Critics have floundered around in interpreting his
Sweeney, etc. poems without discovering the surrealism which is the key
to their understanding."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 As I have discussed the Sweeney poems elsewhere as components of
 Eliot's personal myth of sexual betrayal, psychological retribution,
 and moral regeneration (<i>EDA,</i> 87-101), I want to turn to the
 surreal elements of the poem that has disturbed many readers, "Burbank
 with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar."

<p>
Why, at the end of the war, did Eliot choose to write a poem about
Venice? We know that during his year at the Sorbonne in 1910-11 he broke
away to become an avid tourist of Italy, probably with a Baedeker,
and that Venice was a major stop on his tour. He filled his notebook
with observations about the Grand Canal, the piazza, and St. Mark's
cathedral, noting parenthetically that the quadriga above the portal was
"(a particularly uninteresting set of horses"), the horses that would
later enter his poetic imagination and "Beat up the dawn from Istria/
With even feet."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Later in the day, at the Ca d'Oro, he was struck by Mantegna's <i>Saint
 Sebastian</i> (ca. 1490) and wrote down the Latin script on the
 scroll attached to the candle at the base of the painting:"<i>Nihil
 nisi divinum stabile est; caetera fumus</i>." So, when in 1919 he
 made his vicarious return to Venice in the poem, it was to portray
 his sharp sense of "Time's ruins" in relation to Dante's Italy and
 Shakespeare's Venice, to sketch the return to the post-war city of
 modern English and American tourists&#8212;gentiles and Jews&#8212;who
 have no sense of the history evoked in the poem's allusions, of the
 ethnic and religious exiles the once-great city had absorbed in the
 past, of the Italian victory over the Austrians in Venetia that led
 to the Austro-Hungarian surrender in November 1918 and the collapse
 of one of the most powerful empires in European history. To Eliot,
 Venetian Italy was symbolic of the post-Versailles diaspora, of the
 newly "contrived corridors" (<i>CPP</i>, 22) in which hotly contested
 lands and ethnic-religious dislocations and antagonisms would ensure
 the further disintegration of European unity. It is in the context
 of this diaspora that Gerontion, part Hebrew, part Hellene, sees in
 the window of his decayed European house a squatting Jewish landlord,
 a modern counterpart of Shylock, once again pushed with his people from
 nation to nation, ghetto to ghetto, "Blistered in Brussels, patched and
 peeled in London," fleeing the horrific pogroms in Poland during the
 peace process. Eliot had followed daily reports in <i>The Times</i>
 of vicious attacks in central European cities on Jewish landlords,
 merchants, and citizens, whose only trustworthy avenues of egress were
 England and America and whose plight had made the Zionist movement
 for a national home in Palestine a pressing problem at the Versailles
 conference, which in May adopted a solemn protest against the massacre
 of Jews in Eastern Europe. In the exhausted and conflicted persona
 of Gerontion, Eliot had indeed attempted to reflect the duplicitous
 attitudes toward Jews in the fragmented mind of Europe.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, the poet returns to Venice in a maddened, hallucinative state of
mind, approaching the city through a surrealistic succession of fragments
analogous to the end

<b></b>

of <i>The Waste Land</i>, where the distracted quester can connect
nothing with nothing, where similar broken images suggest the madness that
sweeps over a mind on the brink of mental and spiritual exhaustion. Here
the fragments from works by his literary predecessors in Venice over
four centuries allude to random moments of lust, adultery, mortality,
mutability, eternity: Gautier's carnival cry, "Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire,"
is immediately undercut by Mantegna's Latin subscript ("Nothing lasts
excepting what is divine; the rest is smoke"), and in the surreal
phantasmagoria we hear among others Othello's cry of "Goats and
monkeys!" as he madly anticipates proof of Desdemona's infidelity (IV,
i, 274). The Venetian mindscape that we are about to enter is unreal.

<p>
Eliot had found his way into the poem through three plays that he
was then teaching in his third-year extension course on Elizabethan
literature&#8212;Marlowe's <i>The Jew of Malta</i> and Shakespeare's
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, taught together as a unit, and Ben
Jonson's Venetian play <i>Volpone</i> (<i>EDA</i>, 46, 48), all of which
exhibited the savage humor, "the old English ferocity" that Baudelaire
had perceived in English writing and that Eliot had begun to develop as
a critic of moral life, moving ferociously beyond his earlier satires
of Matthew and Waldo, Russell and Channing.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 He conjoined Jonson's caricatures of Volpone and Paulina into his own
 Princess Volupine, of dubious imperial lineage from the city's Hapsburg
 conquerers, the sickly seductress of the lustful pushovers, Burbank,
 Bleistein, and Sir Ferdinand Klein. It is tempting to see Russell
 and Vivien in Burbank and Volupine&#8212;"They were together, and he
 fell"&#8212;not only in the casual banality of their illicit coupling
 but in the line-play from Tennyson"s "The Sisters," "he fell" for "she
 fell," the she a young woman also seduced by an Earl. After Volupine
 has exercised her wiles on Bleistein, a Chicago merchant far removed
 from his Jewish origin in Vienna and whose stereotypical mannerisms are
 captured in ferocious caricature&#8212;"A saggy bending of the knees/
 And elbows, with the palms turned out"&#8212;she entertains another
 touring Jew, Sir Ferdinand Klein. His British title and names betray
 more of his displaced and forgotten heritage than Bleistein's&#8212;from
 the Ashkinazim who had migrated to Venice from Germany, from the
 Sephardim expelled from Spain by Ferdinand. Eliot greatly admired
 Sephardic culture and traditions, and he was aware that their
 settlement in Venice led to the first gated ghetto, the insalubrious
 ghetto from which the re of Shylock would emerge. As the narrator
 follows Volupine's serial seductions of her Venetian tourists, his
 stream-of-consciousness associations surface like Bloom's&#8212;"On the
 Rialto once," "Money in furs"&#8212; alluding to the Merchants' Exchange
 where Shylock, staunchly defending his faith and tribe, determines to
 "feed fat the ancient grudge" he bears towards the Christian Antonio
 and his abusive anti-Semitism: "He hates our sacred nation, and he
 rails,/ Even there where merchants most do congregate,/ On me ... (I,
 iii, 48-51). Bleistein and Klein, Shylock's deracinated counterparts in
 Venice, cannot in collecting their pound of flesh from Volupine hold a
 candle to Shylock's tenacious defense of his religion, culture, race,
 humanity: "Hath not a Jew eyes?" he asks. "Hath not a Jew hands, organs
 . . . affections, passions? . . . And if you wrong us, shall we not
 revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that"
 (III, i, 61-66). The measure of the present against the past is thus
 taken with the savage techniques of Eliot's past masters. And when the

<b></b>

ludicrous re of Burbank, who has like the Lion of St. Marks been
clipped and flea'd and pared by Volupine, returns at the end of the
poem to ponder the domestication of the leonine emblem of Venetian power
and to meditate on "Time's ruins" and the "seven laws"&#8212;as though
the cultural and architectural erosion of Venice and its stones could
be explained by a Ruskin philosophy filtered through a Baedeker&#8212;
the savage irony of this "intensely serious" poem is complete.

<p>
Well, almost complete. There remains that disconnected, surreal
description in mid-poem. In the midst of the three illicit rendezvous,
"A lustreless protrusive eye/ Stares from the protozoic slime/ At a
perspective of Canaletto" (<i>CPP</i>, 24). This is not the eye of
Bleistein, as some would argue, there to cruelly mock in synecdoche
an exaggerted ethnic physical trait, but the blanched eye of a corpse
that surfaces from the depths of the Grand Canal, from the depths
of the narrator's consciousness, seen through the dying smoke of
Mantegna's scripted candle. It is the haunting eye of "Phl&eacute;bas,
le Ph&eacute;nician," whose corpse had surfaced for the first time
in Eliot's French poem "Dans Le Restaurant." The image of the ancient
Semitic sailor, whose presence now becomes a dominant motif in Eliot's
phantasmagoria, had its origins in the eyes of Joyce's drowned man
in the Proteus chapter, where Stephen contemplates his drowning and
surfacing: "His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death,"
says Stephen&#8212;the "saltwhite" corpse's brown eyes made "saltblue" by
his terrible "seachange," which brings to Stephen's mind the "unearthly
music" of Ariel's song, heard by Ferdinand in <i>The Tempest</i>, "Full
fathom five thy father lies . . . Those are pearls that were his eyes"
(I, ii, 397-99).
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Ferdinand's musing on the king his father's drowning and Ariel's
 horrific description of the drowned corpse's eyes were to become
 for Eliot an irrepressible allusion in his surrealistic sequence of
 poems (his own father had died the previous January). In "Burbank,"
 the water-sick, staring eye triggers images of corpse-chewing rats
 beneath the piles, prompted by Shylock's imagery of the rat-infested
 ghetto when he adamantly defends his pound-of-flesh interest before the
 Venetian court of justice: "What if my house be troubled with a rat" he
 asks the court, "And I be pleased/ To give ten thousand ducats/ To have
 it baned? What, are you answered yet?" (IV, i, 44-46) Shylock's ghetto
 rats and Maurice's trench rats are now loosed in Eliot's imagination,
 to appear repeatedly with the staring corpse in succeeding poems. "The
 jew"&#8212;Phlebas, the Phoenician Jew&#8212;"is underneath the lot";
 yes, but not in the deprecatory sense of Jewish usury or mercantilism,
 a hostile charge repeatedly voiced in Europe and reported in the
 papers. Eliot knew the terrible irony that the new foundations of
 post-war Europe were being laid on the corpses of Jews.

<p>
When Bleistein himself is recast as a drowned corpse in that macabre
funeral lament, "Dirge," he too rests on his back at the very bottom of
the sea, under the one-eyed flatfish, under the wharf rats, deep in the
poetic consciousness, "with a stare of dull surprise."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 "Full fathom five thy Bleistein lies," Eliot begins. And like Joyce he
 lets Ariel's song suffuse the gruesome scene, exclaiming in a draft,
 "Those are pearls that were his eyes. See!" (<i>WLF</i>, 123) before
 withdrawing and reserving the line in favor of a more graphic image
 of the swollen, discolored eyes in their watery grave&#8212;"Graves'
 disease in a dead jew's eyes," a terribly debilitating disease that
 swells the

<b></b>

eyes as they hemorrhage and the capillaries bloom into bright red swirls
and streaks, a condition made even more ghastly in a seachange. As
Joyce's corpse "breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his
leprous nosehole snoring to the sun" (<i>U</i>, 3.480-81), so Eliot's
Bleistein exhibits the "lace that was his nose" as bones peep through
his ragged toes, his lips unfold, and the lobsters work on the flesh,
"scratch scratch scratch" (<i>WLF</i>, 119).

<p>
Eliot's hideous dream of the drowned bodies is unremittingly unreal. So,
when in "The Burial of the Dead" Madame Sosostris turns up from her
Tarot pack "your card, the drowned Phoenican Sailor," it is an illusory
card&#8212;there is no such Tarot re&#8212; and the corpse the
narrator sees is immediately described in Ariel's words ("Those are pearls
that were his eyes. Look!"). She then turns up yet another illusory card,
"the one-eyed merchant," a Bleistein re who becomes Mr. Eugenides, of
Sephardic descent from Smyrna, ousted in the aftermath of the Treaty. In
these changing shapes, the Phoenician Sailor stalks <i>The Waste Land</i>,
even as the phantom, disembodied voice who replies to the neurasthenic
woman who demands to know what he is thinking: "I think we are in rats'
alley/ Where the dead men lost their bones." And when she asks him
"Do you remember/ Nothing?" he replies, "I remember/ Those are pearls
that were his eyes," promising that at the end of the day "we shall
play a game of chess,/ Pressing lidless eyes . . ." The ubiquitous rat
returns in "The Fire Sermon," "Dragging its slimy belly on the bank/
While I"&#8212;the Sailor transred into Ferdinand&#8212;"was fishing
in the dull canal . . . Musing upon the king my brother's wreck/ And on
the king my father's death before him." Before him lie "White bodies
naked on the low damp ground . . . Rattled by the rat's foot only,
year to year." As Eliot confirmed these surreal transrations in the
notes, "the one-eyed merchant . . . melts into the Phoenician Sailor,
and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples"
(<i>CPP</i>, 52). All, including Bleistein, are embodied in Phlebas,
who has become Eliot's Everyman of the Dead, the same sea currents
picking his bones that rolled Bleistein side to side. So in section IV,
"Fear Death by Water," when the narrator issues the gentle imperative,
"Gentile or Jew . . . Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as
you," this ambiguous section of the poem becomes in Eliot's phantasma a
somber elegiac cry, a saner eulogistic pause, a less horrific dirge for
the war dead&#8212;a dirge for the Verdenals and Rosenbergs and Brookes,
the gentiles and Jews of Europe, all beneath the piles, their lidless
eyes washed out, their bones chewed clean in rats' alley.

<p>
<i>The Waste Land</i>and <i>The Criterion</i>, the one launching the
other in 1922, were perhaps symbolic of Eliot's post-sanitorium recovery
of mental health and his post-war commitment to the reconstruction of the
European mind. As he left <i>The Waste Land</i>behind and moved toward
his formal conversion in 1927, he used the <i>Criterion</i> and other
venues to expand and intensify his earlier critique of nineteenth-century
humanists to their contemporary counterparts in England&#8212;John
Middleton Murry, Bertrand Russell, I. A. Richards, and others. At the same
time he began developing his theories of literary and cultural decline,
first locating "dissociation of sensibility" in the seventeenth century,
and then, in a more searching analysis of the shift from classicism

<b></b>

to romanticism in his 1926 Clark Lectures, redefining the dissociation of
sensibility as a larger "disintegration of the intellect" that followed
the age of Dante and the Trecento.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 By the time he wrote his essay on "Dante" , the abominable Treaty
 of Versailles had taken its place in his larger cultural and historical
 perspective: "It is not particularly the Treaty of Versailles that has
 separated nation from nation," he wrote; "the process of disintegration
 which for our generation culminates in that treaty began soon after
 Dante's time."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 The twofold thrust of Eliot's social analysis during the decade was
 to trace over several centuries the subtle changes in the relation
 of religion and culture that had affected the creative sensibility,
 and, simultaneously, to show the more deleterious effects of the
 growth of secular humanism on modern European culture. The latter
 preoccupation is seen in his essay on "Niccolo Machiavelli" ,
 where he looks at an early moment in the post-Trecento decline. Here
 he sympathizes with Machiavelli's taking the humiliation of Italy
 by foreign invaders as a personal humiliation, with his portrayal of
 "how the neglect of religion, occasioned by the vagaries of the Church
 of Rome, had contributed to the ruin of Italy," and with his certainty
 "that a religious establishment of some kind is necessary to a nation."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 The world of human motives that Machiavelli depicts, Eliot asserts,
 "is true&#8212;that is to say, it is humanity without the addition of
 superhuman Grace"&#8212;and to those modern humanists who have supported
 "the effort of the last three centuries to supply religious belief
 by belief in Humanity," he declares, "the creed of Machiavelli is
 insupportable" (<i>FLA</i>, 63). While the targets of this statement
 still included Matthew and Waldo and their contemporary successors,
 he had also fixed his eye on a new type of free-thinking scholar in
 post-War American universities, the New Humanists, disciples of Irving
 Babbitt, led by the Harvard literary critic Norman Foerster. Eliot's
 confrontation with these lost-in-the-attic intellectuals is crucial
 to understanding the context of his allegedly anti-Semitic statement
 in <i>AfterStrange Gods</i>.

<p>
Babbitt had by happenstance appeared in London in 1927 and paid his first
visit to his former pupil. When in the drift of conversation Babbitt
informed him that his friend and fellow humanist Paul Elmer More was
converting to Anglican Christianity, Eliot presented Babbitt with the
"minor shock" of his own recent conversion. Babbitt then convinced Eliot
that it was his duty to "come out into the open."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 It was this conversation with his old master that led Eliot to declare
 in the Preface to <i>For Lancelot Andrewes</i> that the point of view
 behind his work was "classicist in literature, royalist in politics,
 and anglo-catholic in religion" (<i>FLA</i>, ix). Ironically, Babbitt
 had also forced Eliot to come out in the open about the weaknesses of
 Babbitt's humanism.

<p>
Eliot maintained an undying respect for Babbitt as a thinker and humanist,
but he had precious little respect for Babbitt's disciples. Eliot saw
them as zealots who, as literary critics with inadequate philosophical
training, were transforming if not betraying Babbitt's humanism into
what he described to the editor of the <i>Bookman</i> as "the hard and
fast dogma of a new ethical church, or something between a church and
a political party."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 To discredit the disciples, however, he felt that he had to show the
 fundamental flaw of the master. Eliot accepted the fact that Babbitt
 was a non-believer who could not accept any dogma or revelation,
 and he accepted the pure humanism

<b></b>

that he had constructed; it was when Babbitt proposed to set up
humanism as a substitute for religion that Eliot had to confront him
harshly in print: "His humanism is really quite different from that of
his exemplars," he wrote in "The Humanism of Irving Babbitt" ,
"but (to my mind) alarmingly like very liberal Protestant theology of
the nineteenth century: it is, in fact, a product . . . of Protestant
theology in its last agonies" (<i>SE</i>, 422). Eliot saw Babbitt's
doctrine of self control, in which he envisions a society of individuals
controlling themselves with an "inner check" or "higher will," as no more
than another version of Arnold's "best self making for righteousness,"
as another version of Wilson's League of Nations and the Americanization
of Europe. Foerster, a disciple of Babbitt who heretically included
Emerson and Arnold among those who had clarified the humanist ideal,
responded to Eliot's essay by defending Babbitt and arguing that "our
age as a whole . . . insistently claims that the way out of our present
chaos must . . . follow critical and individualistic lines. We cannot see
a time when the principle of outer authority will again be acceptable."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 Eliot's "Second Thoughts About Humanism"  was thus directed
 against Foerster and the "second generation" of free-thinking American
 humanists, describing Foerster's culture as "a propagation of Arnold's"
 and asserting that humanism is in the end futile and sterile without
 religion (<i>SE</i>, 434). When Foerster gathered and edited the first
 collection of essays by the New Humanists, <i>Humanism and America:
 Essays on the Outlook of Modern Civilization</i>, Eliot was
 admitted as a counter-movement antagonist with his give-and-take essay
 entitled "Religion without Humanism," in which he makes the corollary
 assertion that religion depends upon humanism, that without it religion
 deteriorates and produces conflicting types of religious bigotry,
 particularly in America.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 While he was preparing the essay, he confided to Paul Elmer More that
 "Foerster thinks that he and his fellows are the saving remnant [of
 culture], but they seem to me a bargain sale remnant, shopworn."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 What he had come to believe was that human wisdom separated from
 divine wisdom remains worldly and vain, "as vain as folly itself,"
 the primary theme of "East Coker," where he questions the "receipt for
 deceit" bequeathed by humanists from his own Renaissance ancestor to the
 present: "Do not let me hear/ Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of
 their folly,/ Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,/
 Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God" (<i>CPP</i>, 125-26).
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 But the immediate importance of Eliot's three-year engagement with the
 American Humanists was not only that it made him establish the sine
 qua non of his cultural criticism&#8212;the inextricable relation of
 religion and culture and humanism&#8212;but that it consolidated his
 point of view for subsequent engagements with the myriad forms of
 secularism he would soon encounter.

<p>
The New Humanists have led us to a corner of the attic where we suddenly
discover with astonishment Eliot's fugitive correspondence with an
American intellectual whose lifelong friendship with Eliot and whose role
in Eliot's dialectic with Jews and Judaism in the attempted reconstruction
of Judaeo-Christian culture before and after World War II restores a
missing chapter of American cultural history. Recently uncovered in the
American Jewish Archives is an amazing cache of letters between Eliot and

<b></b>

Horace M. Kallen, a Jewish social philosopher and Zionist at the New
School for Social Research in New York.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 When the correspondence picks up in October 1927, Eliot has owed Kallen
 a letter for five months, and when it drops off thirty-three years
 later we have witnessed a dimension of Eliot's private intellectual
 life that must alter our many presumptions about it. There may be more
 and earlier letters, for it turns out that Kallen and Eliot had been
 close friends at Harvard from 1906 to 1911.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
Kallen, the foreign-born son of a rabbi who had immigrated to Boston from
Germany in 1882, had preceded Eliot as an undergraduate at Harvard, taking
his degree in English and a teaching position at Princeton in 1903. When
his position was not renewed, on the administration's discovery that
he was a Jew, he returned to Harvard in 1906, Eliot's freshman year,
to study philosophy and found the Menorah Society, whose aim in part
was to help students create a secular Jewish identity. The ideas of
Emerson and Spinoza had helped Kallen gain intellectual independence
from his father's orthodox Judaism, but the teaching of Wendell Barrett,
who showed him that the Hebrew Bible and the Hebraic tradition had
greatly influenced the Puritan mind and the American character, helped
him reclaim his Jewishness, if not his Jewish religion. As a disciple of
William James and Santayana, who "brought me," he says, "an excitement and
liberation of mind without parallel in my academic exerience," he could
not have had an intellectual orientation at Harvard more the opposite of
Eliot's with Babbitt and Royce. "Royce's courses held no such allure as
did Santayana's and James's," Kallen wrote. "But, although I disagreed
with him from the very beginning, my studies with him, even through the
dissent they aroused, nourished and on occasion enhanced the feelings
of release and adventure that came from my studies with his colleagues."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 Ironically, however, Royce made Kallen his graduate assistant,
 and Kallen's friendship with Eliot may have begun in Royce's open
 seminars. In 1911, he left for a position at Wisconsin, where, in 1918,
 he published <i>The Book of Job as Greek Tragedy</i>, a book that
 Eliot read and admired, a book that initiates his attempts to bring
 together the Hebraic and Hellenic systems in a radical reinterpretation
 of Arnold's terms for his own use.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 Kallen left Wisconsin in 1919 to become a founding member of the New
 York School of Social Research, and by 1924, in <i>Culture and Democracy
 in the United States</i>, he had begun to develop his theory of "the
 American idea," a secular humanist theory which made him, in effect,
 the Jewish counterpart to Babbitt and the New Humanists.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 When his friendly correspondence with Eliot resumed in 1927, Kallen
 was making repeated efforts to bring him to the school to lecture and
 read, an arrangement that finally materialized in the spring of 1933
 when Eliot was Norton Professor at Harvard.

<p>
It proved to be a busy spring of lectures and teaching. At the end of
January Eliot went to Johns Hopkins to deliver his Turnbull Lectures on
"The Varieties of Metaphysical Poetry," staying the week as house guest
of the Jewish philosopher George Boas, who, he told Kallen, had been his
closest friend in graduate school. The next week Eliot began teaching
his undergraduate course on Contemporary English Literature at Harvard,
and in his discussion of James's <i>The Aspern Papers</i> he brought in
"Burbank with a Baedeker, Bleistein with a Cigar," which alludes to
James's novel in

<b></b>

the epigraph: "the gondola stopped, the old palace was there, how charming
its grey and pink" (<i>CPP</i>, 23). James's problem in talking about
Venice as the center of the tale, he told his students, was similar to
his problem in "Bleistein": "To get Venice not too directly&#8212;every
reference to Venice should call up something else as well and vice versa."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 The name Ferdinand, for example, should suggest both the Spanish
 and Austrian branches of the Hapsburgs, Ferdinand the heir apparent
 whose assassination in 1914 precipitated the war, and Shakespeare's
 Ferdinand. Eliot's further problem was to "make a place real not
 descriptively but by something happening there." It is clear that the
 "something happening"&#8212;through Burbank, Bleistein, and Klein in
 Venice&#8212;is meant to be an objective correlative for a general
 cultural diminishment in Europe after the war and in relation to
 an ancient past. And then he turns to the "lustreless protrusive
 eye" of the poem. The eyes, he says emphatically, are "<i>not</i>
 described," insisting that "that is not a failure, except in the
 nature of language&#8212;what is important is not to describe the
 indescribable, but to note its effect." Eliot does not convey in his
 lecture notes the desired effect of the indescribable eyes, but we
 know from following them in their phantasmal sequence how Jamesian
 and Joycean that horrific effect is realized.

<p>
In the midst of this course Eliot went to lecture and read at the New
School and to renew his friendship with Kallen, with whom he stayed and
by whom he was entertained.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 During this week Eliot met and was greatly impressed by Benjamin
 Cardozo, then a Justice of the United States Supreme Court and a member
 of New York's oldest Sephardic congregation. When Eliot later recounted
 his evening with Cardozo to his producer, Henry Sherek, he described
 Cardozo as being "singularly distinguished amongst all the guests"
 and remarked, "I have always been attracted by Sephardim."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
At the same time, Eliot was preparing his Page-Barbour Lectures at the
University of Virginia, published as <i>After Strange Gods: A Primer of
Modern Heresy</i>. He had intended to develop all the lectures on the
material he was teaching in his Harvard course, but he had received
a letter from the faculty coordinator, Scott Buchanan, asking him to
extend his concept of tradition in relation to the "old tradition"
of the South and the attempts of the Southern Agrarians to preserve
it. Eliot was, of course, familiar with the views of Allen Tate and
others described in <i>I'll Take My Stand</i> , which had appeared
as a kind of counterfoil to Foerster's <i>Humanism in America</i><i>.</i>
"Almost anybody here who has spent time in Europe or even New York plays
speculatively and a little fearfully with Catholicism," wrote Buchanan,
"but the strong current of Protestantism of the Baptist and Methodist
variety soon uproots any seedlings that have sprouted. . . . I have no
fears about your sensitivity to the situation and the effectiveness of
your communications."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 Well, Eliot tried to comply, telling his audience that he came into
 the South as a "Yankee," and I need not remind you that this was the
 occasion when Eliot, advising them about reestablishing and preserving
 a traditional culture and religious tradition in an increasingly
 industrialized region, stated that "reasons of race and religion
 combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable."
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
This unfortunate statement, one of the most quoted and disdained in
modern literary and cultural studies, has pained many readers of Eliot,
including myself, and my purpose in bringing it forward again is not to
excuse it but to reconstruct a context that

<b></b>

shows that it is not, regardless of its appearance, an anti-Semitic
statement; it is an anti-free-thinking statement.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 To Eliot, any large number of free-thinking New Humanists&#8212;or any
 secular humanists, Christian or Jewish&#8212;would be intellectually
 "undesirable," for in diminishing the role of religion in culture
 they would threaten the very project of reestablishing a traditional,
 religion-based culture. Indeed, when Eliot's long-time friend and
 <i>Criterion</i> contributor Isaiah Berlin accosted him about the
 sentence when he came across it in 1951, Eliot replied that "the
 sentence of which you complain (with justice) would of course never
 have appeared at all at that time, if I had been aware of what was
 going to happen, indeed had already begun, in Germany . . . I still
 do not understand why the word 'race' occurs in the sentence, because
 my emphasis was on the adjective 'free-thinking.'"
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 As Eliot explained to a former Harvard student, "By free-thinking
 Jews I mean Jews who have given up the practice and belief of their
 own religion . . . The Jewish religion . . . shorn of its traditional
 practices, observances and Messianism . . . tends to become a mild
 and colourless form of Unitarianism. . . . But my view," he insisted,
 "does not imply any prejudice on the ground of race, but merely a
 recognition of what seems to me an historical situation. It is quite
 possible, of course, that all people of Christian descent will become so
 emancipated from Christianity in the course of time that this sentence
 of mine will cease to have any meaning."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 Having come to Virginia from the New School, it is likely that Eliot
 had the free-thinking humanism of Kallen freshly in mind; he would
 not have hesitated to make the statement in Kallen's presence. Though
 Kallen and Eliot never discuss the episode in their letters, Kallen
 would certainly have understood Eliot's intention in relation to
 their own dialogue on the relation of culture, humanism, and religion;
 it certainly had no effect on their friendship. Boas reportedly took
 offense, as have many others since, unjustly so, as will be seen.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 The one word that Eliot deeply regretted in the sentence was "race"
 ("reasons of race and religion"), evident in his response to a critical
 exchange between Edward Dahlberg and Herbert Read, where Dahlberg
 recounts an occasion when F. S. Flint asked him to join Eliot and others
 for a pub lunch. "Flint said to me: 'Tom does not like Jews.' However,
 Eliot was gracious and kind, and did all that he could to be of use
 to me. I blame Eliot for nothing except the books that he has written."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 After the exchange appeared, Eliot wrote to an uneasy Read: "I don't
 think you have any reason to worry about Dahlberg's impression of me
 or anybody else. . . . I only regret Frank Flint's foolish remark and
 Dahlberg's belief in my anti-semitism&#8212;perhaps you believe in this
 too as you don't rebut it&#8212;but at any rate there is only one word
 [race] in my printed works which I regret and I do not know what my
 mind was when I wrote it."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
Meanwhile, after having prepared<i>After Strange Gods</i> for press in
the summer, Eliot and Kallen had more pressing concerns at hand. In
December, Kallen sent Eliot a circular regarding a new International
League for Academic Freedom, founded in reaction to the growing
repression of European academics for their opinions but particularly
to call "attention to the thousands of teachers and men of science in
concentration camps." In March 1933, Heinrich Himmler, then head of the
Munich police, had established the first concentration camp in Dachau,
and the detainment and flight

<b></b>

of German Jewish intellectuals had begun. A small group of the League
for Academic Freedom had organized itself in France, and Kallen sought
Eliot's assistance in spreading the organization. "What do you think
can be done about organizing analogous groups in England?" Kallen asked
him on 27 December 1933. Eliot immediately sent a letter to A. L. Rowse
at Oxford, asking him for ideas about forming academic groups to help
Jewish refugees.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 Eliot then took the initiative to assist and befriend refugees on his
 own, including the sociologist Karl Mannheim and the economist Adolph
 L&ouml;we, Jewish professors who arrived in London after being forced
 out of their respective chairs at Frankfurt University in 1933. Both
 were to join Eliot in a group called the Moot, organized in 1938 to
 discuss the social, political, economic, and ideological challenges
 of the times, to oppose tendencies in Germany, and later to address
 problems of national reconstruction. Through Kallen, Eliot helped
 Adolph L&ouml;we land a position at the New School in 1940. And though
 Eliot expressed his disagreement in <i>Notes Toward the Definition
 of Culture</i> with Mannheim's theory of elites, he was moved on
 Mannheim's death in 1947 to write a supplementary obituary for him
 in the <i>Times</i>, praising his deep concern for the principles
 of cultural reconstruction and affirming for himself and others a
 tremendous personal and intellectual debt.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 Shortly after writing the heartfelt tribute to Mannheim, Eliot received
 a letter from Edward Field of New York, accusing him of anti-Semitism
 in his poetry. "I am afraid that you are over-sensitive," Eliot replied,
 "and like some other people inclined to find anti-semitism wherever the
 word Jew is used in connection with an individual who is not depicted
 as one of the finer types of his people. There is no anti-semitism in my
 poetry whatever. You have probably noticed a Jewish character in a poem
 about Venice in which the reader is meant to infer some contrast between
 Venice of modern times and that depicted in Shakespeare's play. There
 is also a reference to a Jewish landlord in another poem." Eliot
 was always faced with the presumption of his guilt, particularly
 from academics whose presumptions quickly hardened into fact. "It
 might have been reasonable of you on the basis of these two uses of
 the word Jew," Eliot replied to Field, "to enquire whether I had any
 anti-semitic feelings or not. It is certainly not reasonable of you to
 draw that inference and base your letter on the assumption. I am no more
 anti-semitic than I am anti-Welsh or anti-Eskimo. With best wishes."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>

<p>
The cowardly appeasement of Hitler by England and France over his
demands for the Sudetenland during the Munich Crisis of September 1938,
and the failure of the League of Nations in this regard, left Eliot
so disspirited about the future of Europe that he decided to bring
the <i>Criterion</i>to a close in January 1939. And on the advent of
war he must have felt some deep urgency, too, to write his Boutwood
lectures at Cambridge on <i>The Idea of a Christian Society</i><i>.</i>
After the demise of the <i>Criterion</i>, Eliot and other members of
the Moot founded the <i>Christian News-Letter</i><i>,</i> and in the
issue of September 1941 he wrote a special commentary deploring the
Vichy government's anti-Semitic policies and expressing his hope that
Christians would speak out against them:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What gives us the gravest anxiety, is the statement . . . in the
<i>Times</i>. . . that "Jews have been give a special status, based on the laws of
Nuremberg, which makes their condition

<b></b>

little better than that of bondsmen." Anti-Semitism there has always
been, among the parties of the extreme Right: but it was a very different
thing, as a symptom of the disorder of French society and politics for
the last hundred and fifty years, from what it is when it takes its place
as a principle of reconstruction. If this is what is happening, we can
only hope that there has been, or that there will be, some organized
protest against such injustice, by the French ecclesiastical hierarchy. . . But unless the French Church, and the Protestant bodies in France
rise to protest, we must feel serious doubts about the way in which the
revival of Christian France . . . is to be carried out.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot not only spoke out against anti-Semitism; he gave personal
assistance to Jewish refugees as well: we do not know as yet how many
refugees Eliot assisted during the war, but the Kallen letters give us
a glimpse of his private efforts. On 16 November 1941, Eliot wrote to
Kallen on behalf of Mary Trevelyan, who sought Eliot's help in finding
relief for a Jewish refugee named John Amon, described as "a charming and
cultivated man, one of the best and most interesting refugees who have
come to England," a rare-books dealer and Japanese print collector who had
escaped from Vienna to England before going to America, where he was now
in desperate straits. "Forgive my appealing to you," wrote Eliot, "but I
believe that you are a person who takes such matters seriously, and I do
want to put him in touch with the right people!" Kallen happily received
the charge: "I will do what I can about your John Amon," he replied on
7 January 1942, "and I will speak about him to L&ouml;we. Here's to a
reunion in 1943 with our victorious armies in Berlin!"

<p>
When the war finally ended, Eliot was in dialogue with Jewish
intellectuals and Zionists about the problems and the principles of social
reconstruction. Indicative of his multicultural position as influenced
by Kallen and others is an essay originally entitled "The Responsibility
of the Man of Letters and the Cultural Restoration of Europe" ,
in which he stated his conviction "that for the preservation of any
European culture, as well as for the health of its national components,
a perpetual cultivation of the sources of that culture, in Greece and
Rome, and a continual refreshment from them, are necessary. I should
say Israel also, but that I wish to confine myself, so far as that is
possible, to the cultural rather than the religious aspect."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Kallen played his own role in directing people to Eliot, sending to him
 in 1946 Dr. Alfred J. Marrow, a leader of the American Jewish Congress
 and the World Jewish Congress. Marrow is "very much concerned over the
 Jewish situation," wrote Kallen in his letter of introduction on 23
 May, "and the practical steps that might be taken to ease it, first
 in Palestine and secondly in the rest of the uprooted world. . . . I
 want Dr. Marrow to know you and you to know him, and I want him to get
 a perspective of the problems of reconstruction in England and Europe
 through your eyes."

<p>
The mutual respect of the two friends was unflagging, despite their
diametrically opposed social thought. When word came of Eliot's Nobel
prize, Kallen was quick to write on 20 November 1948 that the news
"brought all your old friends a great deal of satisfaction. I must say
though, I was myself intrigued by the terms of the award&#8212;for
your technique not your thought." And when Kallen was honored with
a festschrift for his own achievements, Eliot contributed his essay
"From Poe to Val&eacute;ry," happy to pay

<b></b>

his testimony "to a man whose mind and achievements I have always admired,
and whose personality I hold in enduring affection."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
 "Your being among [the contributors] is especially heartening," Kallen
 had written to Eliot on 25 July 1953, "for our philosophic faiths have
 been not only diverse but in many respects incommensurable, and I am
 quite sure that not a few among your closest aficionados as well as
 among your most unfriendly critics will be crying, 'What the devil is
 he doing in that gallery!' I like to think that the answer would be
 you're there because you recognize that artists and thinkers sustain
 the integrity of their singular vision and action only as 'a sporting
 fellowship even among opposite minds.'"

<p>
That sporting fellowship was to reach its most competitive intensity in
November 1954, when Eliot was asked to respond to a paper that Kallen
gave to the American Jewish Congress on his concept of the "American
Idea," a phrase that Kallen took from the Unitarian abolitionist Theodore
Parker, who meant by it the unification of faiths under a Declaration of
Independence that provided for equal rights while asserting the separation
of church and state. Kallen adopted the idea for his own belief that a
diversity of faiths may be united in a national religion, a religion
that binds together people who need to cultivate their diversities
in a spirit of tolerance, free from aggression and persecution by
others. Eliot was aggrieved that in his address about American Jewry
Kallen was concerned not with Jewish religion but with Jewish culture,
a culture that Kallen wished to remain distinct and wholly Americanized
but not "assimilated." Eliot, who thought such a condition would bring
back the Wilsonian term of "hyphenated Americans," agreed that Jews
had the duty to maintain a distinct Jewish culture while being fully
American. On 26 November he wrote to Kallen:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
But the odd thing is that I believe it on the grounds which do not seem
to be considered in your argument: that is to say, because of the Jewish
religion. The only problem that seems to me vital is the religious
problem. The racial problem, as between Jews and Gentiles, ought not
to exist: and as between Jews who have abandoned their religion, and
Christians . . . who have abandoned theirs, it is a matter of indifference
which body is "assimilated" to the other. What I feel sure of is, that a
<i>culture</i>
is the outcome of, the living garment of, a religion. . . . I beg you,
Horace, not to put the phrase "the religion of America" into circulation.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But Kallen would not accommodate Eliot by admitting that the culture was
dependent on the religion; moreover, in the following months he published
a book whose title was a torment to Eliot, <i>Secularism is the Will
of God</i> , a book that further developed the "American Idea"
and whose title he clarified to Eliot's dismay: "secularism <i>is</i> the
will of God for every nation that is concerned about peace and freedom for
the diversity of its inhabitants and its relations with other nations."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
 To Eliot, Kallen's "American Idea" was no more than a vague deism,
 at best a "mystique." "I gather that American Jews seem to you to
 have cut themselves off from their history," Eliot wrote on 2 April
 1955. "Certainly this is regrettable, but is that not equally true
 of other peoples after becoming Americanised? You speak of 'Jewish
 Education': do you suggest that there should be separate schools and
 colleges? I should not disapprove of

<b></b>

<i>religious</i> foundations, but any segregation on the basis of
<i>race</i> seems to me undesirable. I am interested in the conservation
of Jewish culture not as representing a race so much as representing a
religion." At the end of the letter, looking back over their positions
and arguments during past months and years, Eliot brought a remarkable
conclusion to the thirty-year dialectic: "You know, it seems to me
that you have been defending a religion called the American Idea&#8212;
and that it is I who have been defending a religion called Judaism." As
Joyce's Buck Mulligan describes the Hebraic Bloom to Stephen as being
"Greeker than the Greeks" (<i>U</i>, 9.614-15), the Hellenic and Christian
Eliot in his dialogue with Kallen had become more Jewish than the Jewish
after all.

<p>
That is the way it had always been for Eliot, a religious and not a
racial matter. This he emphasized in a letter of 10 November 1955 to
Dr. Harry Cohen, head of the American Jewish Literary Foundation, who
asked Eliot to comment on the contribution of Jews to modern life. "As
a Christian I must naturally desire that everyone in the world should
be converted to Christianity," Eliot prefaced his reply, "but, short of
this millennial ideal I . . . wish to see the Jewish Faith survive. A
culture can . . . survive for some time the religion without which it
would not have arisen: but I do not believe that it can continue forever
if the religion dies. If the Jewish religion disappeared, there would
still be 'contributions' . . . by individuals whose ancestors had been
Jews. But the common civilisation to which those whose <i>ancestors</i>
had been Jews, and those whose <i>ancestors</i> had been Christians,
were contributing, would be an inferior civilisation."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
 To Eliot, one of the most significant Jewish contributions had come
 from Isaac Rosenberg, who succeeded in writing out of Hebraic life
 in spite of a secular age. Rosenberg's poetry, wrote Eliot, "does
 not only owe its distinction to its being Hebraic: but <i>because</i>
 it is Hebraic it is a contribution to English literature. For a Jewish
 poet to be able to write like a Jew, in western Europe and in a western
 European language, is almost a miracle."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>

<p>
That Eliot's ideal Christian culture accommodated Jewish religion and
culture is no less evident in letters to one of the final correspondents
of his life, the Jewish publisher Victor Gollancz, who, in sending Eliot
one of his edited anthologies containing a passage from <i>Murder in
the Cathedral</i>, described himself on 27 July 1962 as "a sort of Jew."
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
 Eliot replied on 1 August by sending him a copy of the new paperback
 edition  of <i>Notes Toward the Definition of Culture</i>,
 pointing him to added material and notes and stating that he should be
 happier if Gollancz could say that he was "a professing Jew." "It seems
 to me highly desirable," Eliot had written in the new edition, "that
 there should be close culture-contact between devout and practising
 Christians and devout and practising Jews. Much culture-contact in
 the past has been within those neutral zones of culture in which
 religion can be ignored, and between Jews and Gentiles both more or
 less emancipated from their religious traditions."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
 When Gollancz explained the ambivalent nature of his own Judaism at
 some length, Eliot replied on 10 August that he wanted "to get you to
 talk to me about the difficulties of being a Jew in the modern world
 and under very different conditions from those known by the Jews of
 the Old Testament. I must explain that what interests me is religion
 and not race, and that it is in so far as a man's faith derives from
 that of the Jews of the Old

<b></b>

Testament that I am interested in the fact that he is a Jew. It is
difficult enough to be a Christian in the modern world and it seems to
me all the more difficult to be a Jew. You seem to have to me enough
of Judaism in you to qualify as a Jew in my sight!" At the end of the
culture war, Eliot, tired of conducting conflicts with secular humanists
in no man's land, warmly welcomed followers of the Jewish religion into
his idea of a Christian society.

<p>
It has been difficult to find some comic relief in the presentation of
these serious revisionist matters, but at least I can close not with
another American intellectual but with an American comedian, one of
Eliot's last and most enjoyable friends, Groucho Marx, with whom he
exchanged inscribed photographs, good cigars, and shameless puns. In
June 1963, when Groucho informed Eliot that he would stop off in London
on his return from Israel with the promise that "you and I will get
drunk together," Eliot, recovering from illness, replied, "This is not
altogether bad news because I shall be in better condition for drinking
in October than I am now." And then he added, having observed since 1919
the successful establishment of Jewish culture and national independence
in Israel, "I envy you going to Israel and I wish I could go there too. . . as I have a keen admiration for that country."
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
 Groucho's own illness delayed for a year their "memorable evening"
 together, as he described it to Gummo Marx. "I tossed in a quotation
 from 'The Waste Land.' That, I thought, will show him I've read a
 thing or two besides my press notices from vaudeville. . . . Did I
 tell you we called him Tom?&#8212;possibly because that's his name. I,
 of course, asked him to call me Tom too, but only because I loathe
 the name Julius."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
 With the work of culture done, the problems of race and religion put
 aside, with the burdens of Julius and Bleistein removed, the two Toms,
 Groucho with a bourbon, Eliot with a cigar, his death but six months
 away, rolled their eyes and laughed the world away, throwing out
 misquotations from <i>The Waste Land</i>, which I take the liberty of
 doing myself: "Gentile or Jew . . . Reconsider Eliot, philo-Semite,
 who was once handsome and tall as you."

of Armenians during the war, President Wilson had in November 1920
attempted to fulfill the Allied promise of reestablishing an Armenian
state by drawing definitive frontiers, but the designated area had
already been overwhelmed in October by resurgent Turks; in December,
the Armenian Communist party established the Armenian Soviet Socialist
Republic under the protection and control of Bolshevik Russia. In a later
discussion of Wilson and the League, Eliot asserted that the League "is
Modernism in the political field. . . . I am not attacking the League,
but seeking for a definition of its limitations: it can function all
the better, if we recognise what these limitations are. But it would be
better still if its inventor had himself seen these limitations, for what
sentimentalism initiates, cynicism and intrigue can exploit. The great
weakness of Woodrow Wilson was a theological weakness." See "Catholicism

only kindness and understanding. The finest evidence can be found in
his rich and warm obituary notice in <i>The Times</i>, in July, 1962,
of Mrs. Violet Schiff. In his contribution to the obituary on 9 July, 18,
Eliot recalled his memories of the Schiffs and their friends, stating that
"the Schiff's hospitality, generosity, and encouragement meant much to
a number of young artists and writers of whom I was one. . . . I write
primarily to pay homage to a beloved friend, but also in the hope that
some future chronicler of the history of art and letters in our time may

Eliot was so dismayed over the critical neglect of Rosenberg's poems
that he wrote in the following year, "Let the public . . . ask itself
why it has never heard of the poems of T. E. Hulme or of Isaac Rosenberg,
and why it has heard of the poems of Lady Precocia Pondoeuf and has seen
a photograph of the nursery in which she wrote them. Let it trace out
the writers who are not spoken of because it is to no one's interest to
speak of them, and the writers who are spoken well of because it is to
no one's interest to take the trouble to disparage them." See "A Brief
Treatise on the Criticism of Poetry," <i>Chapbook</i> 2 (March 1920):
2. In his letter to the <i>Observer</i> of 18 June 1967 (see also note
20), Jacob Isaacs recalled that "It was from Schiff that Eliot first
heard of Isaac Rosenberg and Eliot praised him and spread his fame long
before the bandwagon rumbled. He once said to me that no English anthology
that did not include Rosenberg was worth anything." He continues: "In
French poetry, [Eliot] was very fond of the two French Jewish poets,
Ephraim Mikha&euml;l and Henri Franck, whose 'Dance before the Ark' he
specially admired. At least that is what he told me, and I don't think
he would have taken the trouble to lie. This was not anti-semitism. It
was grist for the mills of Gaza."

Eliot was to reaffirm this view of his Sweeney poems in a letter to his
brother on 8 December 1922: "I consider my Sweeney poems as serious as
anything I have ever written, in fact much more serious as well as more
mature than the early poems but I do not know anybody who agrees with
me on this point except Vivien and William Butler Yeats who have both
said much the same thing about them" (<i>L</i>, 608).

Almost fifty years later, Michael Goldman wrote to Leonard Woolf to ask
him "If from your personal knowledge of Eliot, you would consider that
he had anti-semitic traits." "I don't quite know what the answer to your
question is," Woolf replied on 30 August 1967. "I think T.S. Eliot was
slightly anti-semitic in the sort of vague way which is not uncommon. He
would have denied it quite genuinely." <i>Letters of Leonard Woolf</i>,

On 28 February 1919, the <i>Times</i> reported that one of the Entente
powers was to be named the mandatory power for establishing a national
home for the Jews in Palestine. "It seems probable that the present
places of immigration for Jews&#8212;America and England&#8212;will
not be open to them or others discontented with their present homes,
for England and America will, it seems certain, be compelled to close
their doors to immigrants for a definite period, not from any feeling
of animosity to the Jewish race, but in order to have a period of
greater social rest . . . for the purpose of internal reconstruction"
(<i>The Times</i>, 28 February 1919, 8). On 4 April, the <i>Times</i>
reported that two million Poles were returning to their country "in a
state of complete destitution and rags" and with no possibility of work,
the Germans having carried away all the machinery (<i>The Times</i>,
4 April 1919, 11.) On 27 May, the Zionist Organization expressed in the

The Eliot-Kallen correspondence was first discovered and its importance
described by Ranen Omer. See his article "'It is I who have been defending
a religion called Judaism': The T. S. Eliot and Horace M. Kallen
Correspondence," <i>Texas Studies in Literatureand Language</i> 39.4
(Winter 1997): 321-56, and I am indebted to him for directing my attention
to the correspondence, which is located in the Jacob Rader Marcus Center
of the American Jewish Archives (AJA), Cincinnati, Ohio.

<p>
<a name="FOOT41" href="#REF41">41</a>.
On 22 October 1927, Eliot asked Kallen to give his regards "to your sister
whom I remember very well, though I do not suppose she will remember
me." Omer, unaware of their earlier friendship at Harvard, states in his
essay that "Eliot and Kallen began their acquaintance in the late 1920s"
(see Omer, 322), but he does not find evidence for their meeting before
Eliot lectured at the New School in 1933. Nor does he dispute the alleged
anti-Semitism of Eliot's early poetry and prose, attributing Eliot's
"late enthusiasm for diversity" to Kallen's influence from the mid-1930s:
"From the letters it is reasonable to assume that Kallen greatly enjoyed
his friendship with Eliot but also saw an unprecedented opportunity to
influence the great poet, to wean him away from an erratic anti-Semitism
that in any case showed signs of fading into the past and toward an
affirmation of the contribution Hebraism had made to world culture"
(Omer, 328).

Eliot's lecture notes for his course on English Literature from 1890
to Present Day (English 26), taught with the assistance of Theodore
Spencer in the spring of 1933, are in the Houghton Library, Harvard
University (MS Am 1691.14[36]). The lectures are described by A. Stuart
Daley in "Eliot's English 26, Harvard University, Spring Term, 1933,"

that it is outside the legitimate sanctions of poetic license.

Kallen hosted a dinner party at a New York restaurant for Eliot, Henry
and Teresa Eliot, and Horace Gregory after Eliot's poetry reading, as
recounted in Gregory's <i>The House on Jefferson Street</i> (New York:
Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971), 205-06: "To me, the reading was a
<i>tour de force</i>, quickened, I thought, by the presence of Henry
in the audience. And when Eliot preceded his reading of 'Sweeney Among
the Nightingales' by saying that the poem was like a modern painting,
abstract and impersonal, I felt that he was addressing his remarks to
Henry directly . . . I thought I saw him turn a bright flicker of a smile
in Henry's direction," as if to recognize Henry's intimate comprehension
of the surrealistic poem.

Tennessee, that used to call itself the Fugitives and now calls itself the
Neo-Confederates, have talked a great deal about this old tradition and
the possibility of protecting and saving it. Allen Tate, for instance,
has described it in terms of an indigenous paganism that never reached
its proper intellectualization in Catholicism."

The first critic to take this position was Cleanth Brooks in "T. S. Eliot
and the American South," <i>Southern Review</i> 21 (October 1985):
"As far as his argument is concerned, <i>free-thinking</i> is
the key phrase. Thus, even the ultra-conservative Old South got
along with its God-fearing Jews very well. There was perhaps less
anti-Jewish feeling in the Old South than anywhere else in the United
States. 'Free-thinkers'&#8212;whatever the final merits of Eliot's
argument&#8212;would have been the accurate term. And if free-thinking
was the issue, whether the ancestors of the free-thinkers were of the
Jewish, Catholic or Protestant faiths would not matter" (921-22).

Letter of 10 May 1940 to John Vincent Healy, Harry Ransom Humanities
Research Center, University of Texas at Austin. Eight years earlier,
when Eliot was Norton professor at Harvard, Healy had submitted nine
pages of poems to Eliot, who responded with frank criticism on 22
November 1932 (Berg): "The faults throughout are the same, a tumid style,
generality of emotion, imprecision of image and no definite location of
anything. . . . I think that what you need at the moment is a great deal
of practice in writing simple expository and narrative prose."

This was reported many years after the event to E. H. Gombrich, who wrote
of Boas in <i>Tributes: Interpreters of Our Cultural Tradition</i>(Ithaca:
Cornell University Press, 1984): "Intolerance of any kind was and remained
anathema to him. He once told me that he had been very friendly with
T. S. Eliot, whom he had known at Harvard and who used to be a house
guest of the Boases in Baltimore, until the moment when he made a
slighting remark in a lecture about not wanting free-thinking Jews in
his ideal community. 'I can at least rid you of the company of one',
wrote George to him, and never received a reply" . Eliot never
hesitated to reply to anyone who accused him of anti-Semitism, much
less a close friend, and the accuracy of Gombrich's anecdotal account
and Eliot's alleged failure to respond remain to be seen. When Kallen
and Eliot later had occasion to discuss their mutual friend, Kallen
told Eliot on 23 March 1956 that he greatly admired Boas for having
"combined moral courage with intellectual gaiety that would stand out
anywhere, but especially among college professors." Eliot's friend
Isaiah Berlin took offense when he came across the statement in 1951,
indignantly quoting it back and questioning Eliot (see Seymour-Jones),
who replied that "the sentence of which you complain would of course
never have appeared at all . . . if I had been aware of what was going
to happen, indeed had already begun in Germany."

Eliot's letter to Austrian-born Harry Cohen (1885-1969), a US surgeon
active in Jewish affairs and editor of <i>American Jews, Their
Lives and Achievements</i> , is included in the Eliot-Kallen
correspondence. Eliot had sent Kallen a carbon copy of the letter for
his commentary, and in his reply of 23 November Kallen wrote that he was
"in entire agreement with what you have said to him. It is only when
we come to definitions of 'religion,' 'culture' that our divergence
would become manifest for I am unable to think of religion as determined
primarily by the content of belief rather than by the act of believing. In
a different context my emphasis would be of the sort that Royce intended
by his word 'loyalty' and from this it would follow that I am unable to
give Judaism or Christianity the preferential position that you give
them. I take them together with all the other religions of mankind. I
recognize that each is a creed and a code to which other people are as
committed as Judaists and Christians are committed to their own creeds
and codes. . . . Perhaps the chief point of divergence between us is
that while I acquiesce in the right of others to their supernaturalism,
I do not give it a privileged position. In Royce's language, my concern
would be 'loyalty to loyalty.'" (AJA)

"A Commentary," <i>Criterion</i> 14 (July 1935): 611. Rosenberg's
poetry was on Eliot's mind again because he had been invited by Ian
Parsons of Chatto and Windus to write the introduction to Rosenberg's
<i>Collected Poems</i> . Eliot had evidently agreed to write it,
but when he developed a bad cold he had to postpone a meeting to discuss
it. To meet a deadline, Parsons assigned the introduction to Siegfried
Sassoon, who also saw in Rosenberg's poems "a fruitful fusion between
English and Hebrew culture. Behind all his poetry there is a racial
quality&#8212;biblical and prophetic." See <i>The Collected Poems of
Isaac Rosenberg</i>, ed. Gordon Bottomley and Denys Harding (1937;
