On 15 January 1886, in a flat rented by Eleanor Marx and her common law husband, Edward Aveling, a group of socialist friends and acquaintances took the advice of Olive Schriener and performed a staged reading of Henrik Ibsen's <i>Nora</i> (later titled <i>A Doll's House</i>) in the early translation by Henrietta Francis Lord. Marx took the part of the heroine, Nora Helmer; Aveling read the lines of Nora's hypocritical husband, Torvald; G. B. Shaw played the blackmailing Nils Krogstad; and May Morris, daughter of William Morris, spoke the lines of Christine Linde, Nora's older, and sadder, childhood friend. By all reports, the reading was a success, though Shaw later recollected that, at the time, he knew little about Ibsen. Within five years, the Norwegian playwright would emerge as a hero of the avant-garde London theatre. For the next twenty years, Ibsen's plays appeared in many modernists' libraries and they were debated by artists and intellectuals throughout Europe.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The 1886 gathering of like-minded socialists was one of many staged within artistic circles, who used a variety of performance events as occasions for social exchange, political polemic, and aesthetic experiment.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Theatrical and paratheatrical entertainments like the Ibsen readings, while often dismissed as trivial, hint at the central role played by theatrical forms of discourse in the practice of modernist sociability.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
One of the unique qualities of this sociability&#x02014;its affinity for argument and debate&#x02014;was described five years later by Edith Less Ellis, following the premier of Ibsen's newly translated <i>Doll's House</i>:

Dramas, dialogues, debates, and recitations were ubiquitous as vehicles for social exchange in the London of 1880-1914, when, together with daily newspapers, theatre had become firmly established as the mass media.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Not only did staged entertainments play before millions of spectators annually but also paratheatrical events&#x02014;staged readings, lectures, charades, and ju-jitsu demonstrations, for example&#x02014;became standard features at private parties, club meetings, religious gatherings, political rallies, and "at-homes." For the London avant-garde, theatrical performance and its variants provided a familiar and flexible form for displaying the very social life they meant to interrogate. During dramatic readings arranged among friends, for example, speakers could magnify and observe social agency through the process of comparing their lives to those of their fictional characters. When the Social Democratic Federation held an "Art Evening" fund raiser on 21 November 1884, Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling gave a reading of Sydney Grundy's play, <i>In Honour Bound.</i> One spectator noted that the play "related their story;" that is, the play invited the spectator to compare the story it told to the personal story of Eleanor and Edward's unconventionally modern live-in arrangement.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In other social exchanges, such as meetings of the Men and Women's Club and the Fabian Society in the mid-1880s, or the Actresses' Franchise League (1908-17), members would stage debates on the merits of "free love," socialism, and votes for women, using the performed nature of these exchanges to purchase self-scrutiny, social validity, and political advocacy.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  In one of their most striking features, some of these events used a public or semi-public forum to debate private content, while others used private or semi-private venues to debate public policy&#x02014;matters such as sexual conduct, deemed intensely intimate, were discussed side-by-side with the merits of socialism. This deliberate crossing of intimacy with publicness&#x02014;in a range of locations from drawing rooms to licensed theatres&#x02014;gave modernist sociability its distinctively edgy quality. 
</p>

<p>
Particular meanings of "public" and "private" have been implicated centrally in the history of events that constitute "sociability," a concept famously used by Philippe Ari&#x000E8;s to refer&#x02014;somewhat nostalgically&#x02014;to the social organization of the old (pre-modern) regime.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In this regime, wrote Ari&#x000E8;s, "the movement of collective life carried along in a single torrent all ages and classes, leaving nobody any time for privacy. In these crowded, collective existences there was no room for a private sector. The family fulfilled a function; it ensured the transmission of life, property and names; but it did not penetrate very far into human sensibility" (<i>CC,</i> 411). For Ari&#x000E8;s, sociability refers to a pre-eighteenth century form of social life in which all members of a community, regardless of age or class, mixed and mingled in collective households and outdoor markets, fields, churches, and public greens. With the eighteenth century rebirth of education, childhood was invented and children became segregated from adults. Gradually, the modern family emerged, which "advanced in proportion as sociability . . . 

<b></b>

retreated" (<i>CC,</i> 406). "One is tempted to conclude," he wrote, "that sociability and the concept of the family were incompatible, and could develop only at each other's expense" (<i>CC,</i> 407). In Ari&#x000E8;s's use of the concept, then, sociability refers to a set of conventions by which a polymorphous public realm of great diversity permitted people of various ages, classes, skill levels, and wealth to coexist and interact in their differences. These conventions did not recognize the practice of privacy&#x02014;and its offshoot, the family. In historical writing after Ari&#x000E8;s, "sociability" has been decoupled from its normative association with the pre-modern sense of "public" and is used instead to describe various modern forms of voluntary association, filiation, and exchange that cross the public (governmental-economic) and private (domestic-family) divide.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
In a lucid survey of the public/private distinction as it has developed in western culture since Ari&#x000E8;s, Jeff Weintraub notes that "the contrast between the 'personal,' emotionally intense, and intimate domain of family, friendship, and the primary group and the impersonal, severely instrumental domain of the market and formal institutions is . . . experienced . . . as one of the great divides of modern life. But historically these two poles emerge together . . . in dialectical tension with each other."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
In a further refinement of these linked categories, Tracy Davis and Ellen Donkin's recent study of women's playwriting in nineteenth-century England assumes a sociability that operates on a continuum within both the public and the private spheres of activity. In this model, socializing and art making both emerged in an "associative public sphere" conditioned by the coupling of the private and public through the eighteenth-century ideologies of sentimentality (dominating the private sphere) and capitalism (dominating the public).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The sociability I hope to make intelligible through a viewing of Ibsenite drama of the London avant-garde offered its participants occasions for critically evaluating the associative public sphere. Women artists, in particular, poised between the private realm of domesticity and sentimentality and the public realm of professionalism, used theatrical and paratheatrical forms to display and critique changing expectations for women's lives. For, of all the social "questions" occupying the day, the woman question, with its implications for marriage, childbearing, sexuality, labor, citizenship, nationhood, and selfhood, proved to be one of the most tenacious, with implications so various and disturbing that some observers registered a degree of panic that modern womanhood was threatening the future of the race.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
The particular case of <i>Alan's Wife</i> , a short play in three scenes with a brief but tangled history, authored in a secret collaboration between Florence Bell and Elizabeth Robins, offers a telling example of how the avant-garde theatre provided a staging ground for displaying and shaping modernist sociability. The play's fable scrutinizes "the great divide" between the intimate sphere of family and motherhood and the public sphere of law and commerce, while the historical circumstances of the play's genesis and production pull into focus more subtle and complex modes of sociability through which historical women theatre artists negotiated their personal lives and public associations.

Alan's Wife</i> &#x02014;the Fable and Its Performance
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
<i>Alan's Wife</i> began as a story, "Befraid," published in a Swedish magazine by Elin Ameen, a younger contemporary of Ibsen's. Following the 1890 appearance of Ibsen on the London stage, the <i>literati</i> had begun to watch for Scandinavian writers, and soon after its publication in Swedish, a summary of the story appeared in W. T. Stead's <i>Review of Reviews</i> for February 1891: "<i>Ur Dagens Kr&#x000F6;nika</i> contains a terrible and powerfully written story&#x02014;physiological and psychological" the summary begins.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  A <i>pr&#x000E9;cis</i> follows, describing the middle-class heroine, Emma, as a gifted and spirited schoolmaster's daughter. Emma marries a factory workman, Hans, attracted to his strength and joy in life. While waiting at their simple cottage for his return home, she learns that Hans has stayed behind to put right a new machine. Eventually four men bring to her door the covered, mangled body of her dead husband. She falls to the ground in a faint. Seven months later, their child is born, but instead of appearing strong and lusty, in the image of Hans, the baby is missing one arm and both legs. Emma broods over plans to protect the child, but fears for its future after she is gone. After baptizing the infant, she does what God will not do by smothering it. Later she is discovered in prison, where she will remain for one to three years, according to Swedish law, unwilling to repent her crime, but taking comfort in the knowledge that she freed her child. 
</p>

<p>
This sketch would have held great appeal for a literate public fascinated by the subjects of marriage and heredity as suggested by the following titles from 1891 issues of <i>Review of Reviews</i>: "Is Habit Hereditary?" "How to Improve the Race. Marry from the Point of View of Offspring," and "'Darwinism in the Nursery.' Curious Experiments with Babies." The story soon drew the attention of French and Russian translators, and Ameen herself wrote a Swedish dramatic adaptation, <i>En Moder,</i> which she sent to Robins with whom she had been corresponding since the appearance of <i>Alan's Wife.</i><sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Robins's and Bell's revisions to Ameen's fable and to Archer's scenario speak to their interest in displaying the dilemma of modern motherhood, the post-Rousseau "regime of total attention to the child from an early age."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Ameen's story and its reworking represent the modern mother as a revisioning of Ibsen's Mrs. Alving, the mother confronted at the conclusion of <i>Ghosts</i> with a choice between euthanizing her son or permitting him to live with severe dementia. Modern motherhood's "regime of total attention" coincides with the emergence of heredity as a determining force in the individual's destiny. Not only must the mother assume total responsibility for her child's well being but she must do so knowing that she cannot control the child's future. She is both compelled and prevented from fulfilling the responsibility of her modern mandate. 
</p>

<p>
The play's shift in setting from Sweden to the north of England was probably the work of Robins's collaborator and closest friend, Florence Bell, a prolific writer of plays, fiction, and biography and a practiced translator of French, Swedish, and German, among other languages. Bell's experience as the wife of Sir Hugh Bell, a north 

<b></b>

Yorkshire ironmaster, included visiting the homes of over 200 laboring families, performing various works of charity, and recording details of the families' lives. Bell's observations of the townspeople, especially its women, published in 1907 under the title <i>At the Works,</i> modified the Victorian genre of (typically middle-class) eye-witness accounts of the working class made famous by Charles Booth's 1886-1903 study of poverty by accounting for the particular conditions of women's lives.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  In removing the location of <i>Alan's Wife</i> from urban London with its growing domestic culture of consumption, Bell and Robins style the environment in which their heroine confronts and makes her maternal choice as both unfamiliar and attractive.
</p>

<p>
Bell and Robins made other changes as well, introducing the young anemic parson and Jean's rejected suitor, Jamie Warren, as a substitute for Archer's older doctor. Scene 2 closely resembles the Ameen story<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  in debating the correct Christian attitude towards the baby's disability, in which Jean resists and Jamie defends stoic acceptance of the child's suffering. But the Bell/Robins's Jean does not, like Archer's, run to her mother in panic following the infanticide; rather, she approaches the cradle clutching a blanket "<i>with a long wailing cry.</i>" The mother's solitary act, not others' responses to it, brings down the curtain. Scene 3 of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> set in the prison to which Jean has been sent, underscores her legal and ethical isolation as she refuses to plead guilty by reason of post-partum depression, or to repent, concluding that she "must" be punished according to the law.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  More radically than Ameen's Emma, therefore, who, according to Swedish custom, faces up to three years in prison for suffocating her child, and whose imprisonment evokes pathos rather than fear, Bell and Robins's Jean embraces her punishment as both necessary and oppositional, resorting to silence as her absolute refusal of the public rule of law.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In their rewriting of Ameen's story and Archer's scenario, Bell and Robins foreground the modern mother through their rendering of Jean's character, the causes leading to the infanticide, and the play's tragic conclusion, which demonstrates the greatest variance from their sources. Jean's and Alan's identity as passionate, sturdy, and generically "northern" people, drawn to one another's health and vitality, exempts them from the scourge of middle-class conformity that has implicitly weakened others like Jamie Warren, the timid curate Jean's mother wishes she had married.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  While based on Bell's direct experience, the northern setting and dialogue created a critical distance from London culture while exploiting the London vogue for regional picturesque, including details of outdoor dining, Yorkshire names, and dialect.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Jean's and Alan's physical, intellectual, and instinctual confidence (qualities they shared with the self-identified Ibsenite avant-garde) become established narratively and visually through an ironic counterpoint to the ordinary townspeople who reluctantly admire their fitness. Alan has stayed behind in the mill to "master" the new saw, which other workers dismiss as "newfangled," while Jean pours her energy into cooking his lunch and cleaning their cottage.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Jean, says Mrs. Holroyd, "was always . . . a strange girl," "I never saw such a lass for fresh air! And Alan is just as bad."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Jean's and Alan's "strangeness" divides them from the audience of sophisticated Londoners and from the more ordinary members of their fictional northern community.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
This same Jean, however, falls down in a conventional melodramatic faint, upon viewing her husband's body mangled by a new piece of machinery. The baby she eventually bears carries Alan's name, and his crippled body replicates the spectacle of his father on the stretcher. Thus, the child's repetition of his father's trauma appears to accord with a centuries-old belief in the impressibility of the fetus.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  That belief appears in this play as the modern trope of heredity, echoing its appearance in Henrik Ibsen's <i>Ghosts, A Doll House,</i> and <i>Hedda Gabler,</i> where it emerges as a powerful agent of repetition hidden in the subject's mind and body. Ibsen's representations of heredity appealed to Elizabeth Robins, whose interpretation of her own life as "cursed" drove her to avoid marriage, sexuality, and childbearing. In a submerged biographical corollary to the fictional Jean, Elizabeth Robins had been warned by her grandmother 10 years earlier not to tempt fate by marrying and bearing children. Robins's mother, Hannah Maria, had undergone severe post-partum depression following the birth of her seventh child when Elizabeth was 10 years old. She spent most of the rest of her life in mental institutions. A letter written to Elizabeth by the paternal grandmother who raised her, Jane Hussey Robins, advised her, "I . . . have written this to you . . . as a <i>warning</i>&#x02014;Sh! It is a thing of heredity&#x02014;Do not, I beseech you, my darling child, rush into matrimony which may plunge you into a sea of difficulty where you may sink to rise no more!"<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Current medical research supported her grandmother's suspicion: "It has always been recognized that . . . heredity plays a very considerable part in mental diseases," wrote Professor E. Mendel, author of the 1908 essay, "Insanity in Relation to Marriage."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  But the role played by heredity in diseases of the mind was mysteriously more significant for women than it was for men: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
(W)hereas under ordinary circumstances crossed heredity is the rule&#x02014;that is, the daughter resembles the father and the son the mother&#x02014;in hereditary insanity the influence of the mother shows itself principally in the daughter, and that of the father in the son. . . . Altogether the maternal influence in the transmission of the hereditary predisposition (to mental illness) is greater than the paternal."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In spite of her grandmother's discouragement, Elizabeth did marry two years later a mentally unstable actor who committed suicide following two years of struggles over finances, illness, and Elizabeth's promising career. As the daughter of a mentally unstable mother and the wife of a mentally unstable man, Robins's hypothesized abortion, speculated to have occurred at some point during her courtship, or in the two years of her marriage, along with her subsequent lifelong refusal to remarry, would seem to be rooted in her sense of biological fate, a sense informing the mimesis of disrement in Alan the son.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  This sense becomes fully expressed five years later in her pseudonymous work of fiction, <i>The Open Question,</i> which interrogates the ethics of bearing children in families afflicted with hereditary disease&#x02014;here disguised as consumption<b>.</b> In the Bell-Robins tragedy of motherhood, fate is red metonymically as heredity rather than God's will. The modern heroic mother does not simply accept but anticipates heredity, and she acts to minimize the suffering it will inflict on the 

<b></b>

innocent. In this respect, <i>Alan's Wife</i> shares common ground not with Medea, who kills her children for revenge, but with slave mother Margaret Garner<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  and other historical and fictional mothers who, while granting their children full subjectivity, wish for or perform their early and merciful deaths to spare them inevitable suffering.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Jean reacts to her crippled baby with a realist performance of puerperal insanity.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  When a neighbor asks her, "What's a mother for, if it's not to care for the bairn that needs it most," Jean, "sitting listlessly" in front of the fire, answers, "I suppose so! That is what's left&#x02014;there'll be nothing else in my life" (<i>AW,</i> 26). But once she is briefly alone on stage, she forcefully declares her love for the baby and, in a following dialogue with visiting Jamie Warren, plots an ethical strategy to set him free.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  In this abrupt shift from the listless melancholia of grief to the coherent resolve of tragic action, the character Jean (in what must have been a virtuosic acting opportunity) takes up the part of the modern mother with militant determination. Not only will she drop all concern for her own future but she will sacrifice her life to ensure that the child will be spared a lifetime of physical pain and humiliation. Under the pressure of Warren's religious platitudes, and in a following monologue preparatory to suffocating the baby, Jean reveals her sense of obligation to the child, masked earlier in the scene by her attitude of depressed indifference. Addressing the cradle, she tells the baby, "I seem to see you in some far-off time, your face distorted like your body, . . . saying, 'Mother, how <i>could</i> you be so cruel as to let me live and suffer? You could have saved me this long martyrdom. . . . You were a coward!" (<i>AW,</i> 36). Twenty-three years later, Angelina Weld Grimk&#x000E9; would write <i>Rachel,</i> an anti-lynching play in which another activist young woman in another melodramatic monologue followed by an onstage faint, abandons her plans to marry and bring children into the murderously racist USA.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  During this period of heightened gender and racial awareness, women playwrights used the re of the tragic modern mother to underscore the contradictions underlying her exercise of maternal responsibility. 
</p>

<p>
In Robins's and Bell's rewriting of the story, Jean's character looks forward to the twentieth century and backward to the nineteenth. She both complies with and resists patriarchy, embracing Alan as her "master" while rejecting Christian commands to subsume her will to God's. But her decision to smother the baby positions her as a "high modernist" mother, anticipating the discourses of Freud, Darwin, and Marx. She attributes to the child a future complete with a fully developed subjectivity for which she alone is responsible ("Mother, how could you be so cruel?"); she perceives him as one of the unfit, with a physically disadvantaged relation to the environment; and she projects onto him an economic vulnerability growing from his radical dependence in an industrial setting where the best workers die first in the contest with machines.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  As a dramatic type, the Bell/Robins Jean ingeniously combines realist detail with stock qualities of the New Woman, appealing both to middle-class Londoners' curiosity about the northern, laboring-class other, and simultaneously representing that other in terms familiar to Independent Theatre audiences acquainted with the New Woman character and anticipating her politicized sister in the suffragette.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The modern mother speaks through Jean's conflating of heredity with fate, and through her performance of the play's tragic conclusion. The Jean we have come to "know" by the end of Scene 2 appears complex and partially hidden, speaking a fraction of what she "thinks." When alone on stage, following the convention of the soliloquy, her "true" inner thoughts and feelings rush to the surface; but when onstage with others&#x02014;her mother, Jamie Warren, or a judge&#x02014;she speaks little, or, if she does speak candidly, it's usually in opposition to those around her. In this way, Bell and Robins contrive, before the final scene, to bring the spectator and reader into intimacy with a maternal character whose burgeoning subjectivity beckons them to discover it hiding within her.
</p>

<p>
Scene 3 opens on a room in the prison where Jean is being held. Officials, the presiding Colonel is told, "Can get nothing out of her" (<i>AW,</i> 38). Mrs. Holroyd appears before the Colonel to plead for Jean's life, but her speech betrays her. Instead of securing her daughter's freedom, she reports that Jean murdered her child in retribution for his disability. Jean, with whom the audience is on increasingly intimate terms, stands before her frightened mother and representatives of the law, having quit speech entirely as a function of her now complete and irreversible isolation&#x02014;the price of selfhood for her and her dead infant. The split view of Jean offered in this scene&#x02014;the external view of her as vengeful, murderous mother versus her self view (shared by a hypothetical audience/readership) as the ultimate maternal sacrificer&#x02014;draws both on the earlier conventions of melodrama, with its faints and gestic silences attributing emotional agency to female characters, and to emerging Expressionist drama, concerned to represent potentially threatening subconscious, nonlinguistic states. Jean's invoking of silence in the face of her accusers&#x02014;a silence glossed by her inner thoughts in the published text&#x02014;both revises the abject silence of the nineteenth-century melodramatic heroine and anticipates the expressive silence of twentieth-century drama. Susan Glaspell's silent, homicidal wife in <i>Trifles</i>  and Sophie Treadwell's "unspoken appeal" to the female audience of <i>Machinal</i> show how silence can function in modern theatre within a realist and expressionist aesthetic.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Jean's silence asserts her isolation, her expanding subjectivity already hinted at in the "wail" accompanying the smothering of her child. Confronted with two maimings, Jean undergoes a double shock that appears first as depression but gives way subtextually in the expressionistically segmented third scene to ethical certainty. Jean becomes a subject-mother and, as such, refuses language and culture in favor of taking back what she produced. As a modern mother, she claims ownership of a child otherwise believed to be a subject of the church, the community, and the nation. This "modern" silence refuses history and culture in the service of what recent theorists would call the Imaginary&#x02014;that hypothetical condition without difference and absence where only identity and presence exist.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  In her farewell to her mother, Jean tentatively uses Christian terms to explain her commitment to a utopian Imaginary, " Maybe I shall find him up yonder made straight and fair and happy . . . in Alan's arms" (<i>AW,</i> 48). Jean's hubris is to hold up the Imaginary as a dream worth dying for. Within ten years, a variation of this dream using a slogan fitted to Jean's resolve&#x02014;"Deeds not words!"&#x02014;would infuse the suffrage movement

<b></b>

with a determination to embed women in the nation's future. Two photographs from the suffrage era help to demonstrate how the social history of women and mothers changed from 1893 to 1914. <a href="#1">re 1</a> shows an imprisoned suffragette, physically isolated like Jean, but aware of the nearby presence of fellow prisoners. <a href="#2">re 2</a> shows how some suffrage mothers included their children in photographs, iconographically declaring them members of the enfranchised future. 
</p>

<p>
Gesturally melodramatic and subtextually modern, the fable of <i>Alan's Wife</i> and its performance looks back at the pathos of Dion Boucicault's plays and forward past Ibsen's, framing the mother as a new subject who both recognizes her child as <i>other</i> (determined by the past or heredity) and as <i>same</i> (a subject who thinks and feels as she does). This was the new challenge to motherhood imposed by the exigencies of heredity. Jean's "heroic" response, represented in the play as a misunderstood rejection of deformity, reconciles post-Enlightenment "maternal devotion" with new understandings of the infant's nature as neither entirely other than nor fully identical with the mother's "self".

As it was revised by Robins and Bell, the play's fable simplified and stylized the representation of family relations and their collision with the legal and economic systems of law and industrial labor. The actual historical circumstances of the play's production and printing, however, involved more subtle and complex modes of sociability through which the collaborators negotiated their private lives and public associations while anonymously producing the controversial drama. <i>Alan's Wife</i> appeared in the second season of J. T. Grein's Independent Theatre Society (1891-1898), one of the avant-garde societies that hoped to revitalize British theatre in the twentieth century. Begun as a provocative venture with an unlicensed<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  1891 production of Ibsen's <i>Ghosts,</i> the Society fashioned itself after Andr&#x000E9; Antoine's Th&#x000E9;&#x000E2;tre Libre, or "Free Theatre," whose "freedom" arose from rejecting not only the aesthetics but also the funding mechanisms and managerial styles of commercial theatres.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  As self-styled alternatives to commercial theatre, societies like the Independent not only represented controversial fictions on stage but also structured and managed themselves in opposition to official, licensed theatres. Microcosmic and typically short-lived experiments, they refashioned theatrical production through brief, new alignments of the public and private realms, offering alternative economic arrangements (usually entailing a subscription system for ensuring ticket sales) and the public staging of heretofore "private" matters such as sexuality, family life, and gender relations.

<p>
The Independent's second season began featuring the "young English writers" originally promised by its collective organizers, most notably the anonymous authors of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> a play set in the north of England with an English working-class woman as its center of interest. At this moment when the lives of women as vehicles of the "new" were the subject of intense debate, women playwrights made calculated choices to appear&#x02014;or not appear&#x02014;as the authors of their works. In the case of the older Lady

Bell and the actress Robins, we will see that each had her own reasons for wishing to remain anonymous, some of them linked to the private realm of family relations and others to the public realm of professional success. But whatever their individual reasons for remaining anonymous, both would have known that anonymity could be productive, guaranteeing curiosity and the expectation of controversy. In the world of the Independent Theatre, anonymity not only protected identity but also sparked interest.

and personal ties between William Archer and Elizabeth Robins. Archer claimed to have read the Ameen story in a Swedish magazine lent him by Robins. The actress, he claimed, read the story in a German translation, but thought it unsuited for drama. But Robins herself described reading a summary of Ameen's story in W. T. Stead's <i>Review of Reviews</i> and did see in it the makings of a play (<i>ER,</i> 89). In his Introduction to the published text of the play, Archer describes writing a rough three-scene scenario soon after reading the story, which he sent to Miss Robins with the names of "two young dramatists" who could turn it into a play. The two young dramatists were Robins and Bell, Archer having confidentially advised them and publicly colluded with their efforts to suppress their joint authorship. Whether it was Archer or Robins who 

<b></b>

set in motion the dramatizing of "Befraid," the play follows the major events described in the <i>pr&#x000E9;cis,</i> changing the national location, some of the characters, the characters' names, and, most importantly, the conclusion, to suit the requirements of a modern tragedy. 
</p>

<p>
By mid-September 1891, Bell and Robins had shown Archer a completed script. They had read Archer's scenario, and accepted some of his criticism of their drafts, but shared a conspiratorial understanding that they should beware of Archer's tendency to suppress their creative efforts. Bell told Robins in November of 1892 that she was sending her the (characters') "names suggested by WA [William Archer]," adding that they needn't show him the play's conclusion, as he won't like it, and "I'm afraid he wd quash it again!" Later, when readying the script for publication, Bell wrote Robins, "As to WA's Preface. . . . I dread it rather. . . . I somehow feel beforehand that I shant like WA very much or Grein either."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  When Archer's 43 page preface appeared in the 1893 published edition of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> both Bell and Robins found it overwhelming, as did Archer's friend G. B. Shaw, who disliked the play ("superstitious atheism"). He chastised his friend, whom he thought infatuated by Robins, in a letter, "The one fact that is clear about <i>Alan's Wife</i> is that you should have written it yourself" (Shaw to Archer 21 Aug. 1893, F).
</p>

<p>
As one of Archer's closest friends and an influential member of avant-garde artistic and socialist political circles, Shaw's opinion of Elizabeth Robins would have made a personal and professional difference to Archer&#x02014;and to Robins herself. Shaw apparently held her in high regard as an actress, but his sexual flirtation complicated their friendship. What Shaw biographer Michael Holroyd called Elizabeth's "prim intensity and devastating stage pathos" both drew Shaw's attention and frustrated his attraction.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  After Robins apparently threw him out of a carriage in response to his overtures, Shaw began calling her "Saint Elizabeth," and sent her letters praising her beauty and mischievously implying that he had enjoyed her sexual favors.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  In the wrong hands, such letters represented a potential threat to the actress. Shaw's serio-comic punishment of Robins for rejecting him revealed another dimension of gendered sociability in the theatrical avant-garde. While he would be the first to condemn it, Shaw's joking letters exploited the sexual double standard by which their discovery would enhance his reputation as a philanderer and damage Robins's reputation as a serious professional. During these years, Shaw used gossip and unflattering accusations directed at Robins to advance his own love interest, Ibsen actress Janet Achurch, and to characterize Robins's influence over Archer as emasculating. Shaw resented her power over his good friend Archer and aggressively promoted Achurch over Robins where he could.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As a late Victorian actress, Robins's position in the London theatre world was uniquely capable of upward mobility and qualified respectability.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  But achieving mobility and respect required a balance between befriending men and becoming intimate with them. The widowed actress, like Robins, was precariously positioned within a field of mostly male professionals who could serve her interests or damage them at will. As Robins's career reveals, the ambitious actress and writer had to cultivate the friendship and admiration of male colleagues while preserving her independence and her reputation for integrity. She had to draw the sustained interest of male managers, 

<b></b>

critics, and spectators, but limit their intimacy. She had, in short, to develop Hedda Gabler's talent for handling a character like the predatory Judge Brack, a talent, Robins noted, few men understood: "How should men understand Hedda on the stage when they didn't understand her in the persons of their wives, their daughters, their women friends?"<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  G. B. Shaw was one of those men, about whom Robins wrote, "He couldn't be expected to understand the as yet, unusually Independent Woman. . . . He . . . never dreamed . . . what a lot of social history was bound up in woman's use of the handiest as well as the most quietly effectual means of warding off complications" (qtd. in <i>ER,</i> 62). 
</p>

<p>
The "social history" implicit in the production of <i>Alan's Wife</i> is a gendered history resembling one of Ibsen's realist plots, turning on secrets, private arrangements and withholdings; heterosexual love, same-sex friendships, small betrayals, and calculated shock, all performed in the wings of a modern theatrical movement making a claim to literary merit. One of the most closely guarded secrets giving rise to the play was Robins's love affair with the married William Archer, whom she met in June of 1890. By the early fall of 1891, their friendship had become intimate and by November of that year Robins wrote that WA was "coming to demand too much of me. . . . It wd. not be hard for me to love this man not wisely but too well."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  They remained secretly (but not necessarily sexually) intimate for a decade and later destroyed most of their personal correspondence. Archer's reading of the Swedish story saw in it a performing vehicle for his "dearest Bessie" that could, with the help of Bell's knowledge of Swedish, quickly become a translation/adaptation. His public sponsorship of the play, awkwardly announced in his excessive preface and underscored in his <i>Westminster Review</i> article, emerged in part, as Shaw recognized, from his involvement with Robins, one that blended the personal and the professional.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  As one of the foremost professional drama critics in London, Archer's opinion had influence, especially among promoters of the New Drama and Ibsen, but his friendships and alliances extended into all realms of professional theatre.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  He used these connections judiciously to help Robins, often giving her advice (which she often followed), especially on the matter of shaping her public image.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Later, when Robins turned to writing fiction more steadily, two of her male friends, both W. T. Stead and William Archer, regularly read her work. (<i>ER,</i> 105). 
</p>

<p>
While Robins and Bell labored to prepare the script, locate actors, and raise funds for the production of <i>Alan's Wife,</i><sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  J. T. Grein, the founder of the Independent Theatre, privately turned to his acquaintance, Mr. Pigott, the examiner of plays, to secure a license to perform it.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  As required of all licensed theatres from 1728 until 1968, a typescript of the play was submitted to the Lord Chamberlain's office for approval, but in this case, it was submitted after omitting (in possible collusion with Piggot) its controversial scene.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Purged of the infanticide scene, the Examiner of Plays passed <i>Alan's Wife,</i> permitting two performances of a drama written in part to defy his authority.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  The sociability enabling this understanding relied on shared class codes (a "gentleman's agreement") overlapping with a shared view of Independent Theatre-goers as elite "knowing" sophisticates impervious to the "contaminating" potential of controversial 

<b></b>

plays. Not only the play's fable but also its production assumed the elite nature of the Independent Theatre enterprise. 
</p>

<p>
Women's forms of sociability, similarly&#x02014;but perhaps more loosely&#x02014;tied to class codes, could be more complex than men's, often including accommodations for husbands, managers, male protectors or authority res, and safeguards for their public image. For their part, Bell's and Robins's personal friendship bridged the distinct realms of Bell's country house set and Robins's theater colleagues,<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  but the repeated secrecy of their professional collaborations suggests that they both enjoyed, even while grappling with, gendered barriers to public visibility. One of Bell's reasons for avoiding public recognition as a professional writer (she discouraged a biography and suppressed her name on translations) was deference to her husband, who disliked her assuming the attitude of a professional. Referring archly to Sir Hugh Bell's wishes, she wrote Robins in 1895, "I must keep up the fiction that (this profession of mine) must be done in a trifling ladylike manner at odd moments or it will be taking it too seriously."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  Robins, belonging in spirit to a younger generation of women, many of whom played by the same rules as men in writing for gain, adopted pseudonyms and anonymity for precisely the opposite reason&#x02014;to avoid paying a professional penalty. Having become known first in England as an actress, she anticipated critical dismissal of her fiction as the curious scribblings of a stage performer. For the sake of her work and its critical assessment, she felt she should distinguish her fiction-writing persona from her performing persona (<i>ER,</i> 106). She may have been following Archer's advice on this point, but she was ignoring publisher and close friend William Heinemann's urging to use her stage name to enhance the sales of her books. As a self-identified hybrid of actress-intellectual, she sought critical acclaim first; sales could follow, or not. Her financial vulnerability encouraged her greater involvement in fiction writing.
</p>

<p>
Both women operated within gendered limits&#x02014;for one of them the traditional limits of class and domestic duty, for the other limits of professional (male) perception and critical judgment. But in spite of their differences, they forged a common ground, eagerly seizing the chance to work quietly, comfortably, and productively with a trusted woman friend. "I grow more conscious of the calm beneficence of a timely word of cheer and affection from a <i>woman,</i>" Robins wrote Bell in February of 1892. As the exchange of letters between the two and biographies of Robins reveal, Florence Bell's intimate friendship provided Robins with the unqualified maternal love she had lacked as a girl, while Bell's husband and children served as a warm and loving family whose shelter she could seek when she needed rest and recuperation. For her part, Bell found in Robins a single woman artist living a life of urban intensity that she envied, tied as she was to a prestigious and public household with its continual demands upon her time and energy. 
</p>

<p>
Bell and Robins held a fierce commitment to the new mother as evidence of the New Woman who could write successfully in a full partnership with another woman. When Robins reported to Bell her reading of the script to actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree in the fall of 1892, Bell replied, "I can't help a chuckle when I hear that he approved of the writing of the piece, and when I think of his maintaining that 

<b></b>

women can't write. . . . the mere thought of ("Befraid") makes my heart leap and burn within me . . . I love you dearly, best of friends and collaborators. 'Women can't write,' did you say?" (FB to ER, Nov-Dec. 1892). In a gesture typical of her maternal generosity towards Robins, Bell urged her to take all (if any) profits they might earn on the play, reassuring her, "I don't . . . mean our friendship . . . to destroy any business relations that may arise . . . what's the good of being on the terms we are on&#x02014;if one mayn't do as one likes over it?" (FB to ER 15 Dec. 1892, Fales). Robins's interest in setting business (i.e. financial) terms for their collaboration no doubt conflicted with Bell's desire to act as generous mother and benefactor. But this potential conflict did not develop, as <i>Alan's Wife</i> made little or no profit even though it proved scandalous. Nor is there evidence of any financial disagreements between the two, as Robins's commitment to anti-commercial (i.e. typically anti-profitable) theatrical experimentation aligned her with Bell's class-based disregard for the business aspects of professional writing, permitting an easy alliance of two women separated by social, cultural, and national differences.
</p>

<p>
Their anonymity freed Robins and Bell to exploit the shock value of Ameen's story without suffering public identification as the authors of the play. Robins, who played the part of Jean Creyke, courted such danger, together with all Ibsen actresses who risked becoming typecast as "Noras" or "Heddas" and/or personally held responsible for the crimes of their fictional characters. The pair derived intense pleasure and amusement from this aspect of their secrecy, both of them careful to keep the play from their close mutual friend, Henry James, whom they felt sure would dislike it, as he could dislike things that were "middle-classy" and "Ibseny": "Oh don't let him throw cold water on it," Bell urged Robins.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Secrets were not, of course, the sole property of women dramatists; men also relied on disguise, ellipsis, and concealment to manage their careers. Archer, with a public image as a "scientific, rational" critic, closely guarded his passionate relationship with Robins. The celebrated Norwegian writer, Bj&#x000F8;rnstjerne Bj&#x000F8;rnson, asked Heinemann not to publish Robins's translation/adaptation of his 1877 novel, <i>Magnhild,</i> for fear the twenty year-old work would jar the music of his more recent writing (ER to FB 16 Dec. 1892). Eight years after <i>Alan's Wife,</i> G. B. Shaw would stage his first theatrical success, <i>Fanny's First Play,</i> anonymously, arousing great curiosity&#x02014;and accompanying publicity, helping to boost its run to 600 performances. 
</p>

<p>
At the same time that the Ibsenite avant-garde eschewed commercial theatre, they were discovering and exploiting their own forms of marketing, including not only calculated anonymity, pseudonymity, bourgeois affront, and the careful sequencing of their published work, but also a bid to raise the visibility and value of dramatic authorship through an Independent Theatre series of published plays. The series was short-lived, finally including only three plays given no advertising. But it anticipated Edwardian playwrights' eventually successful attempts to create a large readership for published plays from among the London <i>literati</i> and a growing, middle-class book-buying public. G. B. Shaw eventually would work out a program for publishing his plays as mid-priced, aesthetically designed books, and even succeed in making a profit 

<b></b>

from the sales of some of them.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The published text of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> with its contextualizing front matter&#x02014;J. T. Grein's Preface and Archer's lengthy Introduction&#x02014;amounted to an exhaustive manifesto, directly and indirectly declaring the theatre's aims, anthologizing critics' attacks on the anonymous play, and carving a place for <i>Alan's Wife</i> in theatre history as a modern tragedy. The two-layered introductory apparatus attempted to give the play material weight and critical heft among critics and professional taste makers, but the attempt proved irrelevant, given the small sales of the series (Shaw's 1893 <i>Widower's Houses</i> in the same series sold only 150 copies).
</p>

<p>
For their part, Bell and Robins exploited the opportunity available to dramatists to generate two distinct texts&#x02014;a performance text and a printed text&#x02014;as a means of satisfying two communities of interest: their live Independent Theatre audience and a hypothetical "literary" audience of book buyers, each of whom was presumed to have a unique response to the play. The authors inserted a subtle but significant stage direction near the conclusion of the published text intended to "translate" for the reader the subtext<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  of Jean's final performed silence: "(<i>Jean's sentences are given as a stage direction of what she is silently to convey, but she does not speak until nearly the end of the act.)</i>" These brief, printed thoughts, consisting of phrases such as "Poor Mother!" "I don't want mercy," "I am not afraid," anticipate Eugene O'Neill's later use of spoken asides<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  and imply Jean's depth of consciousness. But these printed phrases also function dramatically for the reader to underscore Jean's growing isolation and steady withdrawal from representation. Jean's final speech breaks this silence, offering another example of the authors' strategic separating of the performance and published texts. The 200-word performed monologue, complete with a recapitulation of Jean's justification for killing her child and a repeated assertion of her mother's love for the baby, is reduced to 66 words in the published text, edited to underscore the taut finality of Jean's dilemma ("I had to do what I did and they have to take my life for it") rather than to secure a live audience's sympathy for her crime, "It was I who loved him,&#x02014;loved him enough to do the only thing that could help him" (<i>AW,</i> 29). Under the cloak of anonymity, the authors of the published text could forego the special pleading of Jean's final performed speech.

<p class="noIndent">
What appeared to some critics as gloomy, fin-de-si&#x000E8;cle decadence preaching "race suicide" grew out of a vibrant set of flexible associations, including erotic love, fierce competition for rights to Ibsen's plays, loyal same-sex and other-sex friendships, maternal solicitude, and professional sponsorship. The modern mother, positioned between the forces of heredity, the subconscious, and a hostile industrial workplace, provided Robins and Bell with a set of references to their private lives and public postures on issues related to women's roles in a changing world that resonated with their Independent Theatre audiences and readers. <i>Alan's Wife</i> occupied a brief moment in the arrival of the London-based new drama, but its delivery offers striking evidence that theatre and paratheatre functioned as vehicles for modernist sociability. 

<b></b>

While the play's fable represents a stark confrontation between the intimate realm of maternity and the instrumental realm of law and industry, its genesis and production reveal the subtle contours and textures of gender and class interactions among men and women of the London avant-garde. Three decades after the appearance of <i>Alan's Wife,</i> theatre going, debate, and recitation were still informing modernist sociability. Virginia Woolf's diary entry for 23 June 1922 reads

<p>
Semi-private performances like Eliot's have been hidden from histories of modernism. It comes as no surprise that the theatre and its forms gave modern artists a ready and flexible medium for observing themselves refashioning their social lives, but it is surprising that these gestures have been overlooked in accounts of modern art and culture.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  In negotiating a new relation between the intimate matters of sexuality, motherhood, and family on the one hand, and public matters of law, politics, and commerce on the other, artists and intellectuals used the familiar forms of theatre and drama to display the "great divide" of modern culture for their pleasure and deliberation.

For James Joyce, Sigmund Freud, and Rainer Marie Rilke, Ibsen's plays remapped the relation between nation and the individual in exile, between public life and private life. James Joyce's admiration for Ibsen appears first in his review of <i>When We Dead Awaken</i>, "His genius as an artist faces all, shirks nothing. . . . He appears to have sounded (women) to almost unfathomable depths," and later in punning English/Norwegian references to Ibsen's titles in <i>Finnegan's Wake</i> ("For peers and gints, quaysirs and galleyliers, fresk letties from the say and stale headygabblers.") Quoted in Michael Meyer<i>, Ibsen: A Biography</i> (New York: Viking Penguin, 1985), 835; 834-37.

For a concise summary of the New Woman phenomenon, see Susan Kingsley Kent, <i>Sex and Suffrage in Britain, 1860-1914</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), 83-5. She describes the panic resulting from feminists' "attacks" on marriage on 103-5. In her 1899 account of women's decisions not to marry, Ella Hepworth Dixon attributes it to women's "more critical attitude towards their masculine contemporaries. . . . The proper adoring feminine attitude does not, it would seem, come naturally to the present generation." See "Why Women Are Ceasing to Marry," the <i>Humanitarian</i> 14 : 391.

Although three years following <i>Alan's Wife</i> the infamous baby farmer, the "Ogress of Reading," was hanged in Newgate prison for drowning at least 40 infants entrusted to her by parents, the historical record suggests that the last two decades of the nineteenth century saw a marked decrease in infanticides. During this period, the British crude birth rate fell by over 20% as married women took precautions to limit their fertility. See R. Sauer, "Infanticide and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century Britain," <i>Population Studies</i> 32: 1 , 90. The shift in attitude towards the bearing and rearing of children, based in part upon higher rates of infant survival, helped inaugurate modern motherhood.

In their rejection of Archer's rational doctor re, Bell and Robins substitute another Ibsen "type," the conformist cleric, who, like Pastor Manders in Ibsen's <i>Ghosts,</i> counsels Mrs. Alving to adopt a pose of resignation in the face of her own and her son's suffering. The choice of Manders as the model for Jean's rejected suitor underscores the authors' hardening of their mother's resolve and sharpens the polemical point of their drama.

This mimetic gesture looks back at least two centuries to literary and folkloric warnings about the objects proper for a pregnant woman's viewing. In the seventeenth century, Tomasso Buoni wrote in <i>Problemes of Beautie</i>, "Why is it the custome to hange Beautifull pictures in the chambers of those women that are with childe? . . . . This Perhaps because those strange occurrent, that in former times have fallen out, are an instruction to men in these dayes to prevent the like events: For great women by contemplating and gazing on serpents, and Moores in their chambers in the act of generation, have brought forth monstrous birthes, in some re and proportion like unto them." (Buoni, trans. Samuel Lennard [London: G. Eld for Edward Blont and William Aspley, 1606], 67-8). Describing eighteenth-century discourses on the subject, Julia Epstein writes, "According to the theory of maternal impressions, the birth of a defective infant unveiled the secret passions of its mother. . . . above all, the legitimacy of its parentage." ("The Pregnant Imagination, Women's Bodies, and Fetal Rights" in Susan C. Greenfield and Carol Barash, eds<i>. Inventing Maternity: Politics, Science, and Literature, 1650-1865</i> [Lexington KY: University of Kentucky Press, 1999], 118). The Ameen-Bell-Robins fable does not appear to resurrect this early belief but rather to offer evidence of the modern hazards of heredity for the most weak and vulnerable. My thanks to Patricia Phillippy for bringing the early modern sources to my attention.

I can find no support for the claim that the play reflects a eugenicist notion that the infant must be killed because he is too imperfect to live. The authors give this interpretation of Jean's motive to her mother, the play's representative of conformist sensibilities against which Jean's prodigious sensibilities are established. It's never presented as Jean's motive nor is there historical evidence that either Bell or Robins took seriously eugenicist claims of racial weakening. Florence Bell lightly mocks the idea in Chapter VIII of <i>At the Works,</i> "(W)e are constantly, anxiously, unavailingly, trying to prevent the much-discussed deterioration of the race" ; in 1926, Robins wrote near the conclusion of <i>The Secret That Was Kept,</i> "(W)hat childishness is this about race-purity" (qtd in Angela John, <i>Elizabeth Robins</i>: <i>Staging a Life 1862-1952</i> [London: Routledge, 1995], 227; hereafter abbreviated <i>ER</i>).

The play's original and more controversial title, suggested by Florence Bell, was "Set Free" (a literal translation of the Swedish, "Befraid"). This served as a working title until shortly before the play's opening, which suggests a last-minute decision to tone down the play's shocking message.

It bears noting that Jean's variety of religiousness (shared with Ameen's Emma) is vaguely low-church and pointedly unorthodox. She imagines a heaven where her family will be reunited but rejects all forms of religious consolation as offered by her mother and Jamie Warren. The effect is of a woman who will work out her own salvation and that of her innocent baby by trusting her native intelligence and emotional wisdom in an intuitively personal relationship with God. Heaven becomes a utopian version of life on earth.

The stage New Woman, ridiculed in Sydney Grundy's popular play, <i>The New Woman</i>, performed the year following <i>Alan's Wife,</i> was most clearly exemplified in public life by the professional actress, who enjoyed a unique social mobility, coveted her economic independence, traveled unchaperoned, and often held views promoting a woman's right to earn, to vote, to smoke, to choose "rational" dress, and to live alone. See Viv Gardner and Susan Rutherford, <i>The New Woman and Her Sisters: Feminism and Theatre 1850-1914</i> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1992), 1-7. The New Woman's politicized counterpart, the suffragist/suffragette, began to re-awaken in 1893, the year that Mrs. Pankhurst returned to Manchester from London and began organizing the first outdoor meetings that would become a hallmark of the movement.

Licensing was a system for regularizing government control over the content of printed stage plays. In England, dramatic licensing was formalized by the 1737 Walpole Stage Licensing Act and revised slightly by the 1843 Theatres Act. Both Acts required all theatres to submit a copy of their plays for official examination and subsequent licensing by the Lord Chamberlain, a court-appointed official who usually delegated the task to an appointed Examiner of Plays. Sometimes these reviews called for revisions (usually excisions); in rare cases, they banned plays outright. In the case of Ibsen's <i>Ghosts</i>, the Independent Theatre Society performed the play without submitting a copy to the Lord Chamberlain, who necessarily would have refused it a license.

Following the model of Antoine's Th&#x000E9;&#x000E2;tre Libre, Grein called for a subscription system by which audience members were to pay a set amount for the entire season of plays, giving them a sense

of entitlement in the theatre's fortunes and avoiding government censorship by eliding the official definition of "theatre." Early in his planning, he wrote, "A moderate capital (say L2,000) derived partly from honorary contributors, . . . earnest subscribers . . . and small fees to be levied on each play . . . is all that is needed" (Qtd. in N. H. G. Schoonderwoerd, <i>J. T. Grein Ambassador of the Theatre 1862-1935: A Study in Anglo-Continental Theatrical Relations</i> [Assen (Netherlands): Van Gorcum,1963], 101.)

Grein's hope was to nurture native talent in the New Drama, but locating and encouraging original English plays proved difficult. See Schoonderwoerd, 119 ff. The theatre's slim budget required minimal sets, costumes, and effects, relying for its impact on the text of the play and the skill of the actors. It was, by default, a playwrights' and actors' theatre.

Archer nearly invented professional theatre criticism in the late nineteenth century. He served as theatre critic for <i>The World</i>, an urbane serial that nevertheless welcomed his earnest, intellectual reviews. He later wrote dramatic criticism for the <i>Morning Leader</i> and the <i>Star.</i> While with the <i>World,</i> he wrote occasionally for the <i>Pall Mall Gazette,</i> the <i>Manchester Guardian,</i> the <i>Westminster Gazette,</i> the <i>Daily Chronicle,</i> and the <i>Morning Leader.</i> On a more regular basis, he placed major essays in such journals as <i>Fortnightly Review, Longman's Magazine, New Review, Nineteenth Century,</i> and <i>English Illustrated Magazine.</i> Thomas Postlewait, <i>Prophet of the New Drama: William Archer and the Ibsen Campaign</i> (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1986), 34-40.

As Robins informed her collaborator, Bell, Archer counseled her to suppress her name as co-translator of Ibsen's <i>Master Builder</i>: "WA thinks it would unnecessarily emphasize my Ibsen proclivities. Besides giving them a chance to say, 'Let a shoemaker stick to his last' etc." (ER to FB Aug 16, 1892, F). He also advised her against appearing in matinees (as opposed to more prestigious evening performances) unless both the play and the part were "very good indeed to make it worth your while." And he often gave advice on actors suited to particular roles in plays she had purchased or written.

Findlater describes the "strange pact of mutual humbug" in which authors in this period would submit a play "mutilated in the way required by the Chamberlain, and the Chamberlain solemnly licensed it, although both knew perfectly well that the text he was approving would be given only one (or, in this case, two) performance(s)" . The typescript of <i>Alan's Wife</i> held in the Lord Chamberlain's collection in the British Library shows the omission of the suffocation scene. Further, Jean's final speech in the typescript (performed) version is longer than the same speech in the published version and attempts a more elaborate justification of Jean's actions.

As first stated in the <i>Weekly Comedy</i> of 30 November 1889, the aims of the Independent Theatre were to create a theatre "free of the shackles of the censor, free from the fetters of convention, unhampered by financial considerations" (Qtd. in Schoonderwoerd, 101.) But as the private negotiating between Grein and Piggot suggests, the Independent Theatre Society was not independent of the state's attempts to control artistic production, but rather collaborated with the state in establishing a limit of conditionally sanctioned expression reserved for an elite presumed to be sufficiently educated to dispense with a censor's advice.

The Bell/Robins friendship was deeply shaken&#x02014;but finally not broken&#x02014;only by Robins's political involvement with the militant Pankhursts, whom Bell felt had "hypnotized" her friend Robins into working for the suffrage cause and betraying her adopted country. But the friendship survived and, as Bell became older and more fragile, Robins even agreed to help with some of her friend's creative projects that may well have struck Robins as anachronistic (John, <i>ER,</i> 93-6).
