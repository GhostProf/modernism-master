<p class="noIndent">
Over the past twenty years, Louis Zukofsky's sestina "'Mantis'" and its companion poem, "'Mantis,' An Interpretation," have come to occupy a prominent position in the reception of the poet's work and in general discussions of the Objectivist movement.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Most accounts focus on one of three issues&#x02014;the poems' relations to marxism, their relations to imagism, or their relations to formalism. The latter is especially well represented in the critical literature: in the words of Zukofsky's biographer Mark Scroggins, the general consensus seems to be that "[t]he knowledge that the poem bears is a function of its relational structure rather than its referential reach."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In this essay, however, I wish to return to the poems' "referential reach," because something has been missing from the discussion around "'Mantis'"&#x02014;i.e., the re of the praying mantis itself, clearly the "object," the rays of which have been brought to a focus by this Objectivist poem. It is as if the rigors demanded of the critical attention by the poem's formal frame render invisible the re at its center. In her essay on the poem, Susan Vanderborg mentions in passing Zukofsky's sense of the "cost of isolating the insect from its past and present contexts"; and it is precisely these contexts&#x02014;particularly the contemporary historical context of "'Mantis'"&#x02014;that I wish to reinvest in the discussion.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  After all, as Zukofsky says in his essay "Modern Times," "[a]rt does not rise out of thin air"; and in "An Objective," he speaks directly to the issue of historical and contemporary contexts:<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
A poem's "referential reach," then, is the necessary other half of the Objectivist equation, demanding the same grade of attention as the "relational structure" of its form.
</p>

<p>
Thus in spite of the fact that Zukofsky stages the mantis as (literally) rising out of thin air&#x02014;aloft on the updrafts from a subway tunnel&#x02014;the praying mantis was visible in a host of contemporary contexts in 1934, the year the poems were written. My intention here is to recover these contexts, and my main point is this: while critics have articulated the poems' concerns with imagism, marxism, and formalism, no one has adequately discussed their relationship to surrealism: and the praying mantis <i>is</i> the surrealist object as it was being theorized by painters and writers&#x02014;particularly Salvador Dali and Roger Caillois&#x02014;in the early 1930s. References to both of these artists appear in "'Mantis'" and "An Interpretation," and both prominently featured praying mantids in their works at the time. Hence just like "the poor" in "'Mantis,'" Zukofsky's praying mantis "rises from the news"&#x02014;or the newspapers, journals, and art galleries of the day&#x02014;in a myriad of contexts I elucidate below.
</p>

<p>
My reading makes visible a critical element in the lineage of the "object" in Objectivism: i.e., the surrealist object as it was being articulated prior to and during 1934. Both surrealism and Objectivism are aesthetic epistemologies, concerned to understand <i>how</i> an object means <i>what </i>it means, and to provide blueprints for producing what Caillois calls "lyrical objects": paintings, sculptures, films, poems. The differences between these epistemologies are profound&#x02014;for reasons I'll detail below, the differences between them preoccupied Zukofsky in 1934&#x02014;and in "'Mantis,'" the poet addresses them directly; in fact, his Objectivist poem at once absorbs the surrealist object and transforms it in a movement that can only be termed dialectical. Situating Zukofsky's mantis among the numerous images of mantids circulating through the surrealist art and theory of the early 1930s allows us to recover a generative tension in the aesthetic ideologies of late modernism.
</p>

<p>
This issue is important for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that both Objectivism and surrealism have until recently received short shrift from critics and historians&#x02014;although for very different reasons. Objectivism, a distinctly American homegrown literary "movement"&#x02014;whose status as such has always been problematical&#x02014;has remained obscure, if not entirely invisible, even to American readers and scholars; I address this issue below. Surrealism, on the other hand, while easily the most visible and popularly recognizable of the major twentieth-century art movements, has paradoxically suffered from its very successes, which have tended to diminish it in 

<b></b>

the eyes of critics and art historians. Thus as recently as 2003, Jonathan Eburne can write of the "reductive tendency" that dogs much of the critical work devoted to surrealism, and while he argues that "the study of surrealism has begun to move beyond the endless axiomatic work of summarizing and introducing the movement," he also acknowledges that a great deal of work remains to be done.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> This is especially true in the North American context: here, the definitive work is still Dickran Tashjian's magisterial study <i>A Boatload of Madmen: Surrealism in the American Avant-Garde 1920&#x02013;1950</i>, published in 1995&#x02014;up to which year, Tashjian reminds us, "there had been no detailed study of surrealism in its American setting."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  He goes on to disavow any "claim to be comprehensive" in the present book, which nonetheless remains a major benchmark in the study of surrealism and American modernism. And while Tashjian contributes excellent chapters on American surrealist poets like Parker Tyler and Charles Henri Ford, a definitive critical study of the effects of surrealism on American poetry remains to be undertaken.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In this regard, it is telling that neither Louis Zukofsky nor Lorine Niedecker&#x02014;nor, for that matter, Roger Caillois&#x02014;are mentioned in Tashjian's book.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  For the two Americans poets, surrealism was an important and contentious issue in the 1930s&#x02014;for Niedecker, it remained a critical point for decades to come. The absence of their names does not so much indicate an oversight on Tashjian's part as it illustrates the relative invisibility of the two writers at the time of the publication of <i>A Boatload of Madmen</i>. Indeed, since 1995, scholars and critics have gone a long way towards making these poets, and the Objectivist movement in general, both more visible and more tangible.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Something of a sea-change is currently underway in the ever-ongoing rewriting of the history of modernism, as it becomes increasingly clear to many people that the Objectivist poets represent a compelling alternative to the canons of high modernism as they have been articulated over the past half-century, and that these writers asserted&#x02014;and continue to assert&#x02014;a profound influence on poetic practice after World War II.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The works of Zukofsky and Niedecker and the other Objectivists are currently being rescued from decades of neglect in a salvaging operation that is changing the topography of modernism and its poetic legacies.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  And it is in the mantis-poems of Zukofsky and Niedecker, I will argue here, that the initial collision of these two under-theorized movements of late modernism&#x02014;surrealism and Objectivism&#x02014;occurs. In these works, we witness the opening salvos in a debate that will modulate throughout American poetry and poetics of the latter half of the twentieth century and on into the twenty-first, a debate involving fundamental questions about poetic agency and the nature of the poetic object; the role of cognition in poetic production; the issue of form and its relations to content; and the possibility of a political poetry. When John Ashbery writes in 1968 that "Surrealism has influenced us in so many ways that we can hardly imagine what the world would be without it," he invites us to think more critically of the role that surrealism played both in aesthetics and in larger social circumstances of the mid-century.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  And in his essay from 1985, "The Politics of Poetry: Surrealism and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E," Barrett Watten continues this line of questioning into an interrogation of politics and poetic form in a later phase of avant-garde practice. Because Zukofsky's "'Mantis,'" in 

<b></b>

dialogue with Niedecker's early poetry, initiated this critical preoccupation with the practice of surrealism in American poetry, it is important that we understand the issues at stake in the poem.

Zukofsky and Surrealism in the Early 1930s
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
It is by no means immediately obvious that "'Mantis'" and "'Mantis,' An Interpretation" deal in any substantial way with surrealism; this again has something to do with the fact that the poems have not been treated as such by critics. To begin, then, most simply: "'Mantis'" deals with surrealism because, in a letter dated 15 March 1935, Zukofsky tells Ezra Pound that it does so.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  But while Zukofsky does indeed include the stray phrases "Surrealiste/Re-collection" and "Millet in a Dali canvas" (followed by "Circe in E's Cantos") in "'Mantis,' An Interpretation," he nowhere else mentions surrealism in the two poems, which are in no technical way surrealistic.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  It would have been difficult for Pound to do much with these cryptic gestures even if he had read the poem&#x02014;and they haven't lost their obscurity for most readers in the ensuing seventy years.
</p>

<p>
But if we recall the role that surrealism was playing in the arts in America during the early 1930s, we can begin to see Zukofsky's poems as an urgent response to the movement's presence. While officially founded by Andr&#x000E9; Breton in Paris in 1924, it was not until the early 1930s that surrealism became a force in American art and literature.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Its full impact had to wait until the "Newer Super-realism" show at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, which opened on 16 November 1931; and the same exhibition, retitled "Surrealism," when it moved to the Juilien Levy gallery in New York in January of 1932.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  In March of the same year, Levy premiered <i>L'Age D'Or</i>, the collaborative film by Dali and Louis Bunuel&#x02014;the original program of which, by the way, featured on its cover a drawing by Max Ernst of a praying mantis. Thus by the middle of 1932, surrealism had become the subject of a great deal of attention in the American press and among writers and members of the public interested in art&#x02014;although Zukofsky would have been exposed to surrealism even earlier, in the pages of the little magazines of the 1920s and early 1930s&#x02014;notably in Eugene Jolas's <i>transition</i>, which had been publishing surrealist art and literature since 1926.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> Finally, though, it is 1933 that represents the watershed year both for surrealism in the U.S. and for Zukofsky's exposure to and concern with the movement. <i>Minotaure</i>, the premier surrealist journal, began publication in June of that year and was distributed in New York by Levy.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Dali's first one-man show in New York at Levy's extended from 20 November to 31 December of 1933; one of the persons to visit it was Lorine Niedecker, who published her surrealist-inflected poem "Promise of Brilliant Funeral" in <i>Poetry</i> magazine in September; in a letter dated 31 January, she tells Harriet Monroe that Zukofsky "referred [her] to the surrealists for correlation."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  And on 12 December, Dali published an article on art nouveau in <i>Minotaure</i>; I will argue below that in <i>"</i>'Mantis,'" Zukofsky refers to the photographs accompanying this article. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Zukofsky also spent two and a half months (July to mid-September) of 1933 abroad, first in Paris, then in Italy to visit Pound. In Paris, <i>Minotaure</i> was the important new publication, and the Gallerie Pierre Collet had hosted two surrealist exhibitions in June, the second a one-man show featuring Dali's "Millet's Angelus," to which, as we've seen, Zukofsky alludes in "An Interpretation."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  And again, Zukofsky mentions the surrealists to Pound, in a letter dated 12 July and written on stationery from the Hotel du Perigord.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Thus by the end of 1933, Zukofsky had certainly encountered the surrealists, who by all accounts were a cultural force to be reckoned with, whether in Europe or America, in the pages of literary journals or on the walls of art galleries. It is in this context that "'Mantis'" was conceived. The question is, what exactly did one "see" when one looked at or read the works of the surrealists in 1934?

Roger Caillois's "Lyrical Object": Praying Mantids in Surrealist Art and Theory
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In fact, one saw praying mantids, which were prominently featured both in the visual arts and in the literature and theory at the time, and which by 1934 had achieved an iconic significance for the surrealists.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Sidra Stick notes that the praying mantis is among those "swarms of anthropomorphic insects and insectile humans" that fascinated the surrealists, who "created images like [Giacometti's] 'Woman with Her Throat Cut,' which represent female/insect rations as entrapping menaces who are also the victims of violence, pain, and destruction."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Be that as it may, mantids and mantid-inspired forms proliferate in the painting of the early 1930s. Aside from Dali and Caillois, who I deal with in detail below, "Picasso suggestively adapted the most characteristic features of the praying mantis in two important canvases, <i>Seated Bather </i>and the <i>Crucifixion</i>, which date from the beginning of 1930" ("PM," 607), according to William L. Pressly, who reads the re in the former as an insect-headed woman with mantid mandibles. I've already mentioned Ernst's mantis cover for <i>L'Age d'Or,</i> but paintings like 1931's <i>Human re</i> also feature mantid-like forms, and a praying mantis appears prominently in the second plate of the Easter Island section of his collage novel, <i>Une Semaine de Bonte,</i> of 1934.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Finally, Pressly tells us, "Andr&#x000E9; Masson was the artist who most consistently exploited the image of the praying mantis" ("PM," 607). Mantids skitter across canvases like <i>Summer Divertissement </i>(<a href="#1"> 1</a>) and <i>Insect's Betrothal </i>(both from 1934), and Masson continued to paint mantids throughout the later 1930s. Mantids were "in the air," or at any rate in the paint, in 1934, and Zukofsky was no doubt aware of their presence.
</p>

<p>
This is brought home conclusively when we consider Dali and Caillois. By 1934, the former had achieved a great deal of notoriety.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  We've already seen that Zukofsky was familiar with his work. I will address Dali below. But it was Roger Caillois, I have discovered, who provided the immediate impulse for the "'Mantis'" poems. In May of 1934, <i>Minotaure</i> published an essay by Caillois called "Le Mante religieuse" in which he examined the praying mantis as the prime example of the surrealist "lyrical object":

Certain objects and certain images, as a result of a particularly significant form or content, enjoy a greater lyrical potential than others. This potential is valid for a very large number of individuals if not for everyone, so that it seems to be an essential part of the element in question and consequently to have as much claim as this element to objectivity. - 
<p class="blockquote">
	The praying mantis seemed to me, by its name, form, and habits, to present to a rare degree this objective capacity to act immediately upon one's affectivity, which is so useful in resolving the problem of the lyrical communication of the syntheses of the imagination. I therefore carried out some research to confirm my hypothesis on this matter and to understand, by taking a concrete example, how a representation could act upon each individual separately and, so to speak, secretly, in the absence of any symbolic character that would essentially derive meaning from its social use and the greater part of its emotional effectiveness from its role within the community.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
Caillois goes on to examine the praying mantis from various perspectives, describing it in biological and socio-historical terms, analyzing its names and the scientific terminology used to classify it, and collecting various religious, mythic, and legendary anecdotes about it. He quotes numerous authorities, including one who
</p>
<blockquote class="extract">

recounts that the mantis, <i>when questioned by children who are lost, shows them the right way by extending its finger, only rarely, if ever, misleading them</i>. . . .

	. . . On the same subject, Eugene Rolland (<i>Faunes Populaires de la France,</i> vol 13, p. 117) refers to Regius, <i>Mat Medic. </i>(p. 32), but the popular nomenclature he collected is particularly interesting: sometimes the mantis is called an "Italian girl" or a "phantom," and less explicably a "strawberry" or a "madeleine". . . .

	. . . According to [the Hottentots and the Bushmen] the supreme deity and creator of the world is precisely the mantis (Cagn), whose loves are, it seems, "pleasing," and it is especially attached to the moon, having made it out of one of its old shoes. . . . Among its other avatars, it is worthwhile to point out that when killed by thorns that once were men, and eaten by ants, it was resuscitated, its bones having been put back together again. . . .

It is clear that Zukofsky lifted this information almost verbatim out of Caillois's <i>Minotaure </i>article, suggesting that, in the poem, he is not so much encountering a mantis as he is encountering a "Mantis," i.e., a <i>text</i> (which could account for the quotation marks that always accompany the title of the poem). Michael Davidson calls the mantis "a curriculum"; I concur, but I would point out that it is a curriculum with a very distinct (surrealist) origin.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
If "'Mantis'" is, as Zukofsky tells Pound, a poem about the state of surrealism in 1934, it only makes sense that Caillois's text appears in the middle of it. But we must interrogate "Le Mante religieuse" in order to understand what use Zukofsky is making of it: "'Mantis'" is by no means a surrealist poem, although it is "about" surrealism and has a (literal) surrealist subtext. The question is, <i>how</i> is Zukofsky translating Caillois's surrealist lyrical object in(to) his Objectivist poem?
</p>

<p>
In "Le Mante religieuse," Caillois attempts to articulate the terms of what he calls "the systematic overdetermination" ("LMR," 79) of objects&#x02014;which means, as we've seen in the quote above, the capacity for certain objects to work immediately and 

<b></b>

"lyrically" upon "each individual" <i>independently </i>of any socially constructed meaning or cultural symbolic character. Presumably, then, the mantis would "act immediately upon one's affectivity" by stimulating a "primordial" level of the psyche; Caillois concludes his essay by calling the mantis one of those "<i>objective ideograms,</i> which are, in short, <i>a material realization in the external world of the virtual lyrical and passional elements of consciousness</i>" ("LMR," 85). While the "objective lyrical value of the praying mantis" is only "increased" by the scientific facts and folk legends Caillois catalogues in his essay, it cannot be reduced to those facts. To understand the generalized "disturbance" everyone seems to feel at encountering a praying mantis, we must descend to a <i>biological</i> level: human beings feel "an unequivocal attraction to the praying mantis" ("LMR," 79), according to Caillois, because of a series of uncanny correspondences between the insect's shape and behaviors, and various human neuroses.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Thus the mantid's supposed "vampirism" "corresponds to a certain phase of [human] affective development"; i.e., the "castration complex."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Likewise, "[n]aturalists find in the praying mantis an extreme form of the close connection that often seems to combine sexual with nutritional voluptuousness, a connection that Dali has made immediately and intuitively explicit" ("LMR," 80). Its physical rigidity assimilates "the mantis to an automaton&#x02014;that is, in view of its anthropomorphism, to a female android" ("LMR," 82) (cf. Zukofsky: "Android, loving beggar, dive to the poor/As your love would even without head to you" [<i>CSP</i>, 66]), and hence evokes thoughts of death. The mimetism of mantises "illustrates in a somewhat hallucinatory fashion the human desire for a return to an original insensibility that one must compare with the pantheistic conception of a fusion with nature, a frequent philosophical and literary translation of the return to a prenatal consciousness" ("LMR," 83). In short, the mantis, "in its form, being of all the forms the one in which man can recognize his own" ("LMR," 84), is precisely "a <i>material realization in the external world of the virtual lyrical and passional elements of consciousness.</i>"As such, it is the premier surrealist "objective ideogram," an object that immediately inspires irrational fear and attraction by operating directly on the unconscious.
</p>

<p>
The mantis that Zukofsky encounters in the subway inspires just such a range of visceral and immediate emotions, but it also leads to the possibility of historical and political interventions that are absent from Caillois's texts&#x02014;and from the other various appearances of the mantis in surrealist contexts. And if he hadn't already noticed the connection between surrealism and the praying mantis, Zukofsky would have heard it rendered in Caillois's essay, where the latter explicitly mentions the mantid theme in Dali's study of Millet.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Since "Millet in a Dali canvas" appears in "'Mantis'": An Interpretation"&#x02014;and in interesting company, i. e., "Circe in E's Cantos" &#x02014;it is to the re of the praying mantis in Dali's work that I now turn, in order to sketch more completely the surrealist object against which Zukofsky was writing.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<i>paranoiaque-critique </i>(not published until 1963, but already mentioned, as we've seen above, by Caillois in 1934).The earliest reference I can find to praying mantids in Dali's published public writing occurs in "L'Amour" &#x02014;which, again, may be where Zukofsky learned of Dali's "sodomitical" inclinations.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Dali mentions mantids here in the context of the psychology of love, dreams, and preadation, and the image of the praying mantis as the devouring female ultimately serves to bring together a number of related concerns in Dali's work as the 1930s wear on.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Two of these in particular, I will argue, are critical to Zukofsky's mantis poems. Firstly, Dali uses the praying mantis to develop a theory of "predatory" art&#x02014;and here we may recall Zukofsky's call in "An Objective" for "[t]he object unrelated to palpable or predatory intent" ("O," 16). Secondly, he explicitly associates the praying mantis with the entrances to the Paris metro: hence Zukofsky's mantis in the subway updraft. In a very real sense, what Zukofsky encounters in "'Mantis'" is not so much an insect, but a Dali text winging up at him from the entrance to the underground.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the best way to approach Dali's mantis/Millet/metro confluence is to chronicle it as it develops from 1930 on. We've seen the mantis in association with devouring and dream in "L'Amour"; in 1931, Dali publishes "Surtout l'art ornemental," in which he transfers the oneirics of predation from humans to the art nouveau-inspired ornamental wrought iron entrances of the Paris metro.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This predatory or gustatory cast to art nouveau decoration is also the subject of his essay "Concerning the Terrifying and Edible Beauty of Art Nouveau Architecture," which ran in <i>Minotaure </i>3&#x02013;4 during the winter of 1933&#x02013;1934. Most remarkable are the four Brassa&#x000EF; photographs of the Hector Guimard wrought-iron ornaments in the entrance to the Paris metro which accompany Dali's essay. As both Pressly and Haim Finkelstein point out, these are explicitly shot to resemble praying mantids poised in what Dali calls the "spectral attitude" of post-coital, cannibalistic mantid aggression (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). The ornamental iron of the metro is another "lyrical ideogram," an overdetermined object which, like Caillois's praying mantis, is a "<i>material realization in the external world of the virtual lyrical and passional elements of consciousness,</i>"although in this case the biological mantis can be sensed <i>through</i> the crafted metal of the ornament.
</p>

<p>
The link to Millet's painting is made explicit in the caption under the photograph at top left: "It has moreover to do with the metal atavism of Millet's L'Angelus." The mantis-like posture of the iron ornament resembles the bowed re of the praying woman in Millet's <i>Angelus,</i> a painting which Dali reproduced numerous times in his own work, and which is the subject of his <i>Le mythe tragique de l'Angelus de Millet: Interpretation paranoiaque-critique. </i>In this work, Dali describes the "atavism" of the female re in Millet's painting as manifested by her "expectant" or "spectral" posture, and goes on to work out in great detail his "paranoic-critical" reading of the painting, focusing on the re of the praying mantis and generally following Caillois's examination of the insect's "lyrical potential." Hence the latter's citation of Dali's use of "the fearsome insect" in his "paranoic-critical study," and hence the series of grotesque metamorphoses through which Millet's peasants travel during the 1930s in Dali's paintings and graphic works.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The difference is that for Dali, the praying mantis itself is not 

<b></b>

the lyrical object that so violently stimulates the unconscious; instead, the "spectre" of the mantis <i>haunts</i> the images in the painting, just as its presence can be sensed in the iron ornaments of the metro.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In sum, the praying mantis had developed by the summer of 1934 into a central and highly visible icon for the surrealists.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Zukofsky's admonition to Pound that had he read "An Interpretation," he would have "found out" that it concerned surrealism, suggests that Zukofsky thought anyone who kept up with the arts at the time would have recognized the mantis as a subject of recent surrealist discourse: what else in the poem would alert one to such a notion? As part of a more general interest in the hermeneutics of the unconscious, the preoccupation with mantids and mantid-like forms in the surrealist arts and writing of the early 1930s was an attempt to comprehend the mechanics of unconscious projection, to determine the procedures whereby the mind senses correspondences between natural phenomena and its own neuroses. Primarily through the writings of Dali and Caillois, the praying mantis became the premier lyrical object of surrealism. It was an object always already (a) complex; a text whose "wing's leaves" (Zukofsky's phrase) required reading and analysis; a creature whose universally terrifying "effect," acting "secretly," could only be gauged from a position outside of history. In other words, it was an object whose meaning did not derive from "its social use" or "its role within the community," but instead from the organic structure of the psyche.

<p class="noIndent">
This, then, is the composite object that Zukofsky runs into in the subway entrance&#x02014;a "paranoic" thing, rooted in unconscious neuroses and complexes, that immediately and simultaneously evokes fear, attraction, and repulsion in the poet, who "can't bear to look, cannot touch,&#x02014;You&#x02014;": "Don't light on my chest, mantis! do . . . ," he commands in contradiction. Zukofsky's "Re-collection" of Caillois's surrealist collection of facts and stories in stanzas four, five, and six shows that he had read "Le Mante religieuse"carefully, and again suggests that "'Mantis'" is not so much the description of a sudden encounter between a man and an insect, but a more carefully nuanced account of an encounter between a poet and a <i>movement</i>.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Indeed, with Dali's mantic metro as subtext, what Zukofsky encounters in the poem might more accurately be construed as an unconscious force, a force moving through and in-forming the myriad objects of modernity. But here it is most clearly apprehended in that quintessentially modern space, the subway&#x02014;itself a fundamental sign of modernity ever since Pound's "A Station in the Metro," a poem in which the poet also encounters phantoms (i.e., "apparitions").
</p>

<p>
Zukofsky's use of Caillois in this way also suggests that Zukofsky is not entirely dismissive of surrealism. Indeed, his own "original shock" (<i>CSP</i>, 72) at the mantis would seem to confirm Caillois's "hypothesis" regarding the universal and unconscious reaction of people to the insect. Not only does he appropriate Caillois's catalogue to partly account

<b></b>

for what he calls his "sudden jolt," but his project in "An Interpretation" closely parallels Caillois's project in "Le Mante religeuse." In the process of describing how he came to determine the proper form (i. e., the sestina) for the poem, Zukofsky is at pains to understand how the mantis provokes so many intense and various feelings, and all in a heartbeat:

While hyper-textualists may want to hear the title of Jolas's journal at the end of this quote, Zukofsky locates his response to the mantis in his "One human's intuitive Head" (<i>CSP</i>, 68), or more locally, in the "[i]nevitable recurrence again in the blood," (<i>CSP</i>, 69) and in the "nerves, glandular facilities, [and] electrical cranial charges" (<i>CSP</i>, 71) of the brain.

But there is a crucial difference between the two writers' conclusions about the praying mantis. While Caillois's mantis affects the psyche at the level of the neurotic complexes, stimulating castration anxieties, desires to return to the womb, and other "primordial passional conflicts," Zukofsky's remains resolutely <i>sensual </i>and <i>textual</i>: his concern is instead with a "forgetting and remembering Head" (<i>CSP</i>, 68):

The "residue" of the Melanesian creation-myth in our emotions, then, is not archetypal, but is instead the product of something that has been <i>read</i>, <i>heard</i>,or <i>seen</i>: i.e., in this case, Caillois's essay, which Zukofsky had no doubt read before he encountered the mantis (the poems were written on 27 October and 4 November, respectively). For Zukofsky, the mantis provokes <i>only recent memories,</i> not a collective unconscious:

This stanza of "An Interpretation" is critical for understanding Zukofsky's critique and transformation of Caillois's surrealist lyrical object into his own Objectivist lyrical object. Note that the poet is most interested in the point at which the "senses' awareness" interfaces with the "invoked collective," which, as we've seen above, comprises "whatever has been read, heard, and seen." Here again, like Caillois, Zukofsky interrogates his shocked reaction to the mantis, as the product of what he "presently" sees (i.e., the mantis in the subway) and what he's formerly learned (whether forgotten or remembered) of mantids. However, the collective, he says, remains <i>as propaganda</i>&#x02014;not 

<b></b>

as an archetypal unconscious, but as a "material" with a "use function." Zukofsky thus implicitly criticizes any art in which an "invoked collective/ . . . subdue[s] the senses' awareness": i.e., an art which insists that objects like the mantis are only signifiers of an a-historical, universal Unconscious, an art which loses the "senses' awareness"&#x02014;and hence the present scene, transected by history and politics.

Here, then, is "predatory" art, an art that is not just itself obsessed with appetite and predation, but which constantly collapses "lyrical objects" into their Freudian pretexts, their "'scientific'" data forever used to rehearse versions of castration anxiety or the Oedipal complex. Zukofsky advocates in this essay a return to "the historical dimension of events actually happening" ("MT," 59); as against the films of Jean Cocteau and Ren&#x000E9; Clair, he praises Charlie Chaplin for realizing his characters "as products of the economics of working day life or a holiday and present[ing] them as people of impulse" ("MT," 59):

"'Mantis'" is just such a montage, a poem gathering together a host of interacting facts, emotions, texts, memories, and impressions, all situated in a particular historical moment, and bringing them into the dialectic of "thought's torsion." Zukofsky famously likens the Objectivist poem to a camera, "<i>the lens bringing the rays of an object to a focus . . . inextricably the direction of historic and contemporary particulars</i>" ("O," 12). Thus, like Chaplin's cinema, Zukofsky's poem captures an "existence interacting with other existence in all its ramifications":

Surrealist symbols vs. Objectivist facts; the collective unconscious vs. a curriculum of texts; the "invoked collective" vs. the "senses' awareness"; predation vs. propaganda; psychodynamics vs. political dynamics; symbolism vs. historical dialectics: these are the issues addressed in "'Mantis'" and its "Interpretation." Zukofsky's two poems make up a long commentary on surrealism and its objects; on the limits of a hermeneutics so categorically bound to the texts of psychoanalysis; and on the inability of the "movement" to "move." While surrealism's data has "become more and more inert," "the mantis <i>can start</i>/History etc."&#x02014;or at any rate can <i>startle</i> it into starting.

Unlike the surrealists, who "subdue the senses' awareness" and thus the present (historical) scene in their pursuit of the unconscious and its complexes, the Objectivist poet keeps both "the simultaneous" (i.e., incidents, objects, immediate "existence in all its ramifications") and "the diaphanous" (i.e., what has previously been seen, heard, and read, cropping up as it does unexpectedly in the blood) <i>historical</i>, in his one head. For Zukofsky, the unconscious is a product of culture and history, not nature and instinct&#x02014;to defer to the latter is to replace the possibility of revolutionary movement with the inertia of psychological archetypes.
</p>

<p>
But Zukofsky makes here what is perhaps an inevitable and certainly a suggestive association between the poet's Head and the decapitated head of the male praying mantis, also alluded to at the end of "'Mantis'": "Android, loving beggar, dive to the poor/As your love would even without head to you" (<i>CSP</i>, 66). This alignment of capitals suggests an element of danger: the female surrealist mantis decapitates the male 

<b></b>

Objectivist mantis, whose Head continues its Orphic song regardless. Surrealism was, as I pointed out earlier, a potent new aesthetic just beginning to become prominent in American arts and letters, and Zukofsky no doubt felt threatened by its rising popularity, especially given the public's general lack of interest in his own work and that of his fellow Objectivists. Perhaps he realized that his call at the end of "'Mantis'" for the return of the surrealist lyrical object to a revolutionary "use"&#x02014;

&#x02014;would go unanswered; certainly, there was little in the winter of 1934 to suggest otherwise.
</p>

<p>
But Zukofsky was also aware that his audience was small and intimate and primarily included other poets, like Williams, Pound&#x02014;and Niedecker, with whom in 1934 he shared a close correspondence. Zukofsky's disapproval of Niedecker's interest in surrealism has been well documented; I have already mentioned her visit to the 1933 Dali show, the publication of her surrealist-inspired poems in <i>Poetry</i>, and Zukofsky's referral of her to the surrealists "for correlation."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  In February and May of 1934, she sent two three-poem series, entitled "CANVAS" (later spelled "CANVASS") and "Three Poems," to Harriet Monroe, who promptly rejected them; all six poems were published by Pound in <i>Bozart-Westminster </i>in the summer of 1935. Niedecker describes both series as "an experiment in three planes: left row is deep subconscious, middle row beginning of monologue, and right row surface consciousness" (<i>LN:WP</i>, 182): hence the Freudian paradigm critical to the surrealists. In fact, it is in the context of a discussion regarding surrealism that Pound complains to Zukofsky about these poems. In the same letter&#x02014;in fact, in the same paragraph&#x02014;in which he admonishes Pound for not reading "'Mantis'" and hence not understanding his opinion regarding surrealism, Zukofsky mentions Niedecker's "mental stubbornness" regarding the issue. Thus in "'Mantis,'" Zukofsky was also responding to the surrealist proclivities of one of his closest associates, as is illustrated in Niedecker's "Beyond What":

Do we not see in these lines the re of the praying mantis? Niedecker's interest in surrealism in 1933 and 1934 coincided with the publication of Caillois's "Le Mante Religieuse" in <i>Minotaure </i>and with Dali's ongoing preoccupation with the praying 

<b></b>

mantis in his essays and painting. To employ phrases like "decapitated areas," "liquidating aftermath," and "black winged lazuli" in a surrealist poem in 1934 was to evoke the mantis that was ubiquitous in surrealist discourse at the time. Niedecker's cryptic phrases sketch a mantis couple at the precise moment of the post-coital decapitation of the male by the female, as the "inspired marksmanship" of the female leads to the "gleeful instant" of the cannibal feast. The spectral insect haunts Niedecker's language just as it can be sensed through the iron ornaments of the Paris metro.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  That Niedecker labels "Beyond What" the "subconscious" entry of the series only corroborates this&#x02014;whatever the fragmentary, insectoid lyrical object in the poem is, it participates in the very specific surrealist vocabulary designed to evoke the violent and demonic underside of the psyche that Caillois and Dali argue is so sensitive to the image of the praying mantis.

The apparition of the praying mantis also peeks out of "Canvass," the left-row subconscious section of Niedecker's earlier triptych poem of the same name:

The bent petal of line one suggests the ubiquitous foliage that acts as camouflage for the mantis's leaflike body (think of the jungles that Masson's and Ernst's mantids inhabit); the masked ovoid eggs in the middle of the poem and the color counters "bluegreen" and "flat grey shoulder" accommodate themselves to the re of a predatory insect, as the "carrions eats its call, waste it." Even the droll ecclesiastical carriage of the praying mantis is caught in the "testament to Sundays" of the poem's final phrase.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the "refractory" of line one, suggesting the refraction of the bent petal, also evokes "refectory," the dining hall in a monastery or a convent. The poem reads as a sort of gnomic hallucination of erotic predation&#x02014;"gnosis" and "loin" peek through

the refracted foliage of the first three lines, and the language in the middle of the poem&#x02014;"cream redbronze/attempt salmon egress/masked eggs/ovoid/anodyne lament"&#x02014;suggest spermatazoa swimming salmon-like upstream to ova (only to end up "lamented"). The rhetorical registers of the poem multiply: "anodyne" suggests "anodize," the process of coating metal; hence the "steel-tin/bluent" and the metal bluegreen/drying." Anyone who has ever blued the barrel of a gun recognizes what's going on here&#x02014;this is a poem about hunting: one blues a rifle barrel in order to protect it from moisture. "Smoke dent" and "exceptional retard" suggest the firing and recoil of the weapon, braced against a "flat grey shoulder." Apparently what's being hunted here is a <i>canvas</i>back&#x02014;in the words of Webster's, the canvasback duck has a "brownish-red (i.e., "redbronze") head, dark breast, and light grey back" (i.e., "flat grey shoulder"). In true surrealist fashion, Niedecker violently yokes dissimilar images to present a dream-like collage or collision of images of hunting, sex, and eating&#x02014;the copulating cannibal mantis is also the duck hunter. Or, to transpose the letters of the single word in the fourth line, a <i>drake </i>hunter; for the hunter of "Canvass" is explicitly a hunt<i>ress</i>&#x02014;"she knows how/For a testament to Sundays"&#x02014;whose "inspired marksmanship" becomes the subject of "Beyond What."

<p>
While Zukofsky's mantis poems can thus be read as a riposte to the petalbent devil in Niedecker's early surrealist work, Niedecker was perhaps threatening to Zukofsky in 1934 for reasons other than her attraction to surrealism. And while the details of their personal relationship remain controversial, the praying mantis operates as a highly suggestive lyrical object through which the two poets could consider not only their aesthetic allegiances but also their very fraught sexual relationship, whatever its details may have been.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Not only was Niedecker reading about and looking at res like Dali's <i>Homage to the "Angelus" of Millet</i> (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) and <i>Architectonics of Millet's Angelus</i>, but she was incorporating them directly into her poetry. On the May&#x02013;June 1935 calendar page of the text known as "Next Year, or I Fly My Rounds Tempestuous," dated by Zukofsky Christmas 1934, Niedecker scrawled the following poem:

Dali's picture (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) depicts the two bent peasants of Millet's painting as brick ruins, mourning two tumbledown structures at their feet. Clearly, Dali's threatening woman continued to haunt Niedecker's imagination, if only "aurally." In the winter of 1934, was she planning to use its mantid wings "next year" to "fly her rounds tempestuous"?

The details of the poets' personal relationship may never be clear. It suffices to say that Zukofsky's two poems about surrealism were intended as both a plea and a warning to writers like Niedecker. If the surrealist is, ratively speaking, the mantis in "'Mantis,'" then Zukofsky's call to her to fly on the armies of the poor reads as a request for a return to a political poetry; alternatively, Zukofsky is warning us that the surrealist praying mantis can bite off a poet's head&#x02014;the "forgetting and remembering Head"&#x02014;rendering the poet, not a bodiless Head, but a headless Body, a pre-conscious intelligence tied to the fiction of instinctual drives and blind to the historical circumstances around it.
</p>

<p>
In a short piece from 1930 entitled "Influence," Zukofsky discusses the matter of the effect upon the poet of other writers and traditions:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The matter of an influence acting in common upon individual temperaments results in differences which have variegated it and been variegated by it in accordance with: 1. its presence in the air: sometimes the proximity of a poet's edified literary acquaintances, however conscious or unconscious a poet may be of the almost literal drafts around him; 2. coincidence of the temperament affected and the temperament only apparently, not actually affecting; since the modality of events of a period of fifty or seventy-five years may show, at any time of their calendar, two similar individuals, different as to locale, and contemporary or anachronistic as to their birth and mortuary dates; 3. conscious choice or rejection of a literary tradition.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Here is "'Mantis'" in a nutshell: the poem is precisely a response to a "presence in the air"; and in this case the insect "steadying lost/In the cars' drafts" and the "almost literal (literary) drafts" around the poet come ultimately to the same thing&#x02014;the Objectivist transformation of the surrealist lyrical object.

In the eyes of its Anglo-American critics, surrealism still tends to designate a quaint set of formal practices that produced the movement's unusual, if obfuscatory, visual and verbal works, as well as its broader 'utopian' program of dream and revolution."

Most importantly, the last four years has seen the reappearance&#x02014;and at times the <i>first</i> appearance&#x02014;of both Zukofsky's and Niedecker's major works, many if not all of which had been out of print for years.

Both poets were also the subjects of major centennial conferences: The Lorine Niedecker Centenary Celebration 1903&#x02013;2002 took place from 9 to 11 October in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and The Louis Zukofsky Centennial Conference at Columbia University and Barnard College took place in New York from 17 to 19 September 2004.

In what appears to be an uncanny coincidence, the review of the Julien Levy show by Matthew Josephson in <i>The New Republic</i> for 3 February 1932 is followed by a very short story by one Moe Bragin entitled "The Praying Mantis." In this story, a group of working men&#x02014;a cabby, a waiter, a cook, and "the owner of the dog"&#x02014;who says things like "[Hoover] don't do nothing about this deepression"&#x02014;watch a dog attack a praying mantis as they "sit on boxes in the night" behind a "cheap lunch room in a 

<b></b>

Virginia city" and discuss current politics. The mantis "'must be one of them bugs the gov'ment brings in to eat germs,' says the cabby," who later crushes the wounded insect with his foot. The four men complain about the ineffectual policies of the Hoover administration and the Depression in general, and conclude that the mantis is better off dead, since it will not have to work. I have no idea whether or not Zukofsky saw either the review or this story, but it reminds one of his call in "'Mantis'" for the mantis to "Fly . . . on the poor, arise like leaves/The armies of the poor . . . " (<i>CSP</i>, 66). See <i>The New Republic: A Journal of Opinion</i> LXIX:896 (New York, Wednesday, 3 February 1932), 321&#x02013;2.

In a letter dated 17 February of the same year, William Carlos Williams recommends that Zukofsky read a review of the Levy show in <i>Fifth Floor Window</i> that he terms "a readable article on Surrealism" (cited in Dickran Tashjian, <i>Williams and Automatic Writing: Against the Presence of Surrealism</i>, in <i>William Carlos Williams Review</i> 21.2 [Fall, 1995], 10).

Pressly writes that "[t]he praying mantis became a central iconographic preoccupation for the Surrealists and their circle primarily as a result of its extraordinary mating ritual in which the female devours the male during or after coitus. Influenced by the writings of Freud and fascinated by his concept of man's repressed sexuality, the Surrealists found this insect's cannibalistic nuptial a compelling image of the potential for erotic violence lurking in the darker recesses of the human mind" ("PM," 600).

"It is not surprising that the great similarity between humanity's organic structure and biological development, combined with the identical external conditions of its physical world, should have considerable resonances in its psychic world, tending to produce within it a minimum number of similar reactions and consequently spawning within every mind the same affective tendencies and primordial passional conflicts . . .

The case of Dali is even more applicable because of the impressive, comprehensive document on the relationship between love and <i>homophagy</i> that goes to make up his paranoiaco-critical study of Millet's <i>Angelus</i>; he was forced to bring in the fearsome insect that in fact unites these two savage desires" ("LMR," 80).

The subject-rhyme here of Pound's Circe and Dali's praying mantis in "his paranoiaco-critical study of Millet's <i>Angelus</i>" is worth noting: in the same letter (March 1935) to Pound where he berates him for not reading "'Mantis,' An Interpretation," Zukofsky writes that "in Mr. Pound's last 'Cantos' I have found nothing to move the cockles of my heart or the network of my brain, outside of 5 lines (perfect lines) given over to Hathor and her box and some musical metaphysics of the dark Cavalcanti" (<i>PZ</i>, 164). This directs us to Canto XXXIX (published in <i>Eleven New Cantos XXXI&#x02013;XLI</i> in 1934), a poem given over entirely to the Circe episode (Book X) of the <i>Odyssey</i>. Pound describes here the heavily opiated, densely sexual atmosphere of Aiaia. Zukofsky suggests that Circe is a type of the sexual predator that the surrealists objectified as the praying mantis.

"In addition to the well-known symbolic eroticism of mystical ecstasies to which the posture of the woman in <i>L'Angelus</i> corresponds, you will agree with me that the position of the hands brought up together under the chin and leaving exposed especially the legs and the belly, is a common posture. . . . This posture entails in my opinion very distinct exhibitionistic, expectant, and aggressive factors. In fact, we are dealing with a typical posture of expectation. It is an immobility that is a prelude to imminent violence. It is also the classical springing posture of animals, and it is one that is common to kangaroos and boxers; and above all, it is the one dramatically illustrated by the praying mantis (spectral posture)" (<i>DCW</i>, 290&#x02013;1).

One of the oddest conjunctions of surrealism and praying mantids is made by Julien Levy in <i>Memoir of an Art Gallery</i> (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1977) where he describes Arthur Cravan:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Bravado, Craven, how you are transformed! Into a praying mantis that flew into my room years ago and nibbled into my ear that you were Arthur Cravan, friend of our best friends, father of my first wife's half-sister. Are you praying now, or preying, out in the wild?. . . . And there was the time there appeared on my wall a mantis, clawing a painting by Yves Tanguy&#x02014;if it was you. Then that summer night in Yves' own room when we spoke of you and mantis again, you flew in the window. We preserved you in a jelly jar. Jean Cocteau thought you very genial, a Knight of his Round Table. Marcel Duchamp thought you were Marcel Duchamp. He told me this once, and, unbelievably, another mantis flew by. When I was in Greenwich Village, a girl who said her name was Margie (she later explained it was a marginal name) rang the doorbell, boldly put her foot in the door, and asked, "Did you call my call house?" A mantis was tangled in her hair and she was your joking daughter Fabienne, quite disguised. I have a short film of your t with the world champion prizeter Jack Johnson. It was mislaid for a period, and the day it turned up, I swear a mantis entered my house again.
