Social Drama Queens
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Pity the drag queens who perform for unreceptive audiences. Two cases
from World War I are worth recalling from the pages of the London tabloid
<i>The News of the World</i>; both illustrate the gender disruption
associated with modern warfare. The popular weekly newspaper took note
of some "strange antics" occurring in June 1918. Victor Wilson, who,
as the headline announced, "IN FEMALE ATTIRE / MASQUERADED AS GIRL TO
HAVE FUN WITH SOLDIERS," created enough of a sensation to merit a short
report in the paper, but his local impact in the Edinburgh area must have
been even more sensational. Wilson went looking for love in all the wrong
places. But on one particular outing, he was oblivious to the fact that
while a soldier on his own might have been susceptible to a pick-up,
propositioning two or more soldiers in a group would almost certainly
invite a homophobic response. Here is the report in full:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The strange antics of Victor Wilson, a Dundalk Labour Exchange official,
who is alleged to have been in the habit of masquerading as a young woman,
with the object of having fun with soldiers, resulted in his appearance
yesterday before the local magistrates. Although the accused was dressed
in ladies' garments, and wore a hat and veil, and attempted to attract
the khaki-clad lads, 3 of thelatter deposed that, becoming suspicious,
they informed the local constabulary. P[olice] C[onstable] Quinn then
assumed military uniform, and going to Castletown Railway Bridge, kept
the defendant under observation, eventually entering into conversation



with the supposed "lady" who, becoming uneasy at the turn of events,
tried to bolt. Quinn blew his whistle, and the 3 soldiers aided him
in arresting Wilson, who was alleged to have offered 5 s[hillings] to
let him off. After other evidence the accused was returned for trial
at Louth Assizes, bail being allowed.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Wilson's entrapment by the police and military gives some indication of
the anxiety about transgressive male sex/gender identity and behavior
which the pressures of war might exert on secure notions of masculinist
and patriarchal culture. His transvestite forays into cross-class
homosexual encounters ended in his apprehension and exposure at the
hands of the authorities and the objects of his desire, working-class
soldiers in uniform. Such would have been the fate of many men whose
outlaw desires were stimulated by the enticing spectacle of massed male,
uniformed flesh during the Great War.

<p>
Wilson's masquerade was, however, not as wholly dysphoric as another
case trumpeted in the tabloid approximately two weeks later (18 June
1918). Readers were treated to the pitiful spectacle of "THE EFFEMINATE
SOLDIER / DESERTER WHO LOVES TO WEAR BEAUTIFUL DRESSES." Without
implicating Frederick Wright as a homosexual, <i>The News of the World</i>
informed its titillated readers that he appeared in court in women's
attire at Highgate, London and was charged, on remand,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
as an idle and disorderly person found in female attire, and further with
being an absentee from the Royal Fusiliers. [The] Accused, after first
denying that he was a man, admitted that he had masqueraded under the
name of Kathleen Woodhouse and had adopted the disguise to escape from
the Army. He said that he disliked soldiers and soldiering; in fact,
everything manly. He added that he wished he had been born a woman,
as he loved wearing beautiful dresses.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>The News of the World</i> reported that this spectacular case of gender
dysphoria had previously attempted suicide, been rejected by his family
"because of his effeminate ways," and was remanded "to await an escort"
back to his regiment. The judge gruffly remarked, according to the report,
"that he did not suppose he would be of much use in the Army. In the
meantime the police might put him into proper garb. 'I should not send
him to the Army in this condition'" (ibid.).

<p>
Ironically, Wright's garb was not necessarily improper: had fate more
fortuitously intervened, he could have been of much use to the British
ting forces as one of a corps of drag artists performing in camp
and shipboard theatricals that were officially sponsored by the military
during the Great War.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  His failed flight from masculinity, male bonding, and militarism
  stands as a poignant attempt to desert from precisely what the civilian
  Wilson found so dangerously alluring in male homosocial arrangements in
  wartime. Yet these dissenters from sex/gender norms, however disastrous
  their performances in drag, were two of countless actors in a social
  drama spotlit, with blinding intensity, by the pressures of World War
  I, which was the first significant war following the establishment
  of the male homosexual as a separate class of being. This drama was
  what Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick called the "chronic, now endemic crisis of

<b></b>

homo/heterosexual definition, indicatively male, dating from the end of
the nineteenth century."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  If we cast this crisis in metaphorically theatrical terms, the
  homo/hetero schism in male identity and relations had become a
  phenomenon by the time of the Great War.

<p>
As anthropologist Victor Turner has theorized at length, the defining
sense that culture is theatrical is heightened by the "social dramas"
that constantly emerge, even traumatically erupt, from the surface of
social life.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  Social dramas expose the subcutaneous levels of the social structure
  and both activate and reveal a culture's conflictual relations and
  associations based on such determinant factors as gender, class,
  division of labor, race, ethnicity, and so forth. Turner limns
  the social drama as consisting of four phases: breach (the forcing
  of antagonisms into the open); recognition of crisis; redress; and
  resolution/conclusion (<i>RT,</i> 10). The problematic breach in male
  homosociality manifests itself as a crisis during the Great War which,
  in Turner's conceptualization of the social drama, is redressed by the
  kind of machinery that attempts to "seal up punctures in the social
  fabric" (ibid.). Forms of redress intended to resolve or forestall
  conflict may either take juridical or ritual means (like the theatre)
  that have a "therapeutic" intention.

<p>
Wilson's frantic evasion of arrest and his hysterical bribery attempts,
and Wright's melodramatic suicide attempt and outrageous cross-dressed
appearance in court, inspire me to consider them as exemplary, but
fatally misdirected (or undirected), drama queens in the social
drama being played out in World War I. What they lacked was the
proper stage upon which to conduct the kind of transgressive behavior
punitively redressed by the unflattering glare of juridical and mass
media spotlights on the home front. The irony, I will demonstrate, is
that certain cultural apparatuses during the Great War did not merely
facilitate the connotative articulation of polymorphously perverse
desires, but actually put riotous cross-dressing onto stages close to
the front lines. Indeed, the unprecedented spectacle of innumerable
soldiers and sailors cavorting in frocks became a system of popular
cultural production institutionally fabricated, and even necessitated,
by the rupture of the homosocial continuum in 1914.

<p>
Theatre behind the front lines during the war drew both euphoric and
dysphoric sustenance from the tortuous and highly-panicked slippage
between prescribed identification and proscribed desire in homosocial
arrangements. The theatrical stage was the site where the pleasures
and anxieties of same-sex relations could be made manifest, embodied
and enacted as public spectacle for the gaze of those experiencing
the crisis of male-male relations. In Turner's terms, theatre, as a
ritual mode of redress, is a cultural mechanism by which a viewer is
able to confront, comprehend, and respond to this crisis. "By means of
such genres as theatre . . . performances are presented which probe
a community's weakness," as a means of resolving the conflicts which
underscore the social drama represented on stage (<i>RT,</i> 11). Behind
the curtain-as-veil, aberrant male-male desires could be staged in an
effort to "solve" the crisis of male bonding spotlit by the war's impact.

<p>
In this essay I investigate how the crisis of male-male bonds during
the war was given "redress" in theatrical terms via the ubiquity of
cross-dressing in the spirit of

<b></b>

carnivalesque and camp. Most striking about the phenomenon of officially
sanctioned transvestism during the war is the degree to which it
was an expression, however problematic, of crossing the homo/hetero
divide. Cross-dressing by soldiers on stage demonstrates how a theatrical
form can make sense of the crisis being enacted. I argue that the
glorious--but hugely problematic--excess of male cross-dressing in mass
troop entertainments flirted with the possibility of repairing schisms
in the homosocial continuum in ways that were wholly untenable in the
aftermath of the war. The discursive production of homosexuality in modern
British culture was, to a significant degree, dependent on the theatrical
performance of "perverse" desires, identities, and styles by bodies
on stage. Popular musical comedy performed by soldiers and sailors had
the potential both to challenge and to confirm the "logic" of normative
heterosexuality within male social arrangements. Cross-dressing on stage
ritualistically desublimated and resublimated the array of inhibitive
repressions structuring male bonding during the war. How audiences reacted
to this challenge to what was otherwise sublimated and repressed, and
how it took on a kind of cultural imperative, are my subjects.

<p>
The 22nd Divisional Theatre's presentation of Oscar Straus's operetta
<i>The Chocolate Soldier</i> in the summer of 1918, just behind the
front lines in eastern France, necessitated the enactment of a range of
women's parts by soldiers in the 22nd. All the female roles were assumed
by men, including the pretty "rival" Mascha, played by Second Lieutenant
T. F. Sampson of the Cheshire Regiment, and the ingenue Nadina, played by
Private T. Wardle, also of the R.A.M.C. The program for the production
lists the names of the male chorus members who were required to sing as
"Officers, Soldiers, Peasants and Bridesmaids, etc." The synopsis on the
back page of the program suggests that the performance required men to
enact convincing desire for other men (in drag) in an elaborate comic
plot reveling in mistaken identities, concealed bodies, and feigned
"flirtations" that "yielded affection." Throughout, the hero Bumerli's
"youthful mien and carriage" is admired by the "women" in the plot:
Nadina, her cousin Mascha, and her mother Aurelia. The program note
concludes: "The sentiment of 'The Chocolate Soldier' is evolved by the
love affairs of Bumerli and Nadina, Mascha and Alexis."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Remarkably, the 22nd's elaborate staging of gender-transitivity in the
midst of the carnage of trench warfare was quite unexceptional. British
theatre during the Great War bears out Marjorie Garber's contention that
cross-dressing does not merely inhabit the margins, but also "the very
heart of public, institutional, and mainstream structures."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  As Garber surmises,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Whatever the specific semiotic relationship between military uniforms and
erotic fantasies of sartorial gender, the history of cross-dressing within
the armed services attests to a complicated interplay of forces, including
male bonding, acknowledged and unacknowledged homosexual identity,
carnivalized power relations, the erotics of same-sex communities, and the
apparent safety afforded by theatrical representation. [<i>VI,</i> 55-6]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The open predilection for, and appreciation of, cross-dressing by the
British during World War I was not, therefore, just a subversive or
"secret" form of transgressive "release." Rather, it was also a seemingly
mandated form of ludic experimentation that was structured by the crisis
of the homo/hetero binary within homosocial formations. The cross-dressed
entertainments permitted the creation of a quasi-utopian space where
the traumatic undercurrents of this social drama could receive at least
partial salutary psychic and cultural propitiation, however much it
was expressed in misogynist, racist, and homophobic terms. In other
words, it is possible to argue that if the male homosocial continuum
was wholly unmarked by rupture, the spectacle of cross-dressed soldiers
in a theatrical site would not (need to) exist. Certainly, World War
I was marked by an unprecedented efflorescence of cross-dressing in
institutionalized military "performance."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Military-social historian J. G. Fuller has established that at least
eighty percent of the divisions that served in the active war theatres
(western and eastern fronts) sustained an established theatrical
subunit. This was most often referred to, in suitably carnivalesque
terms, as the "concert party," made up of enlisted men and their junior
officers, many of whom had theatrical and entertainment backgrounds
before conscription, enlistment, or commissioning.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  By the end of 1917, division and battalion concert parties were
  "practically universal" (<i>TM,</i> 96). That this institutionalization
  of theatre became so rapidly entrenched suggests that hegemonic forces
  tolerated, if not encouraged, the outbreak of carnival. An extensive
  culture of popular theatrical performance served as a vital component
  in the formation of esprit de corps. There was little attempt made to
  censor content and "officer attendance, and often participation, gave
  their implicit sanction to the proceedings" (<i>TM,</i> 102). Despite
  the fact that much satire was directed at the officers, they "accepted
  the comic strictures offered from the stage; they did not stand on
  their dignity; they were 'alright' at bottom, simply men doing their
  job" (ibid.). The concert parties enabled officers and the other ranks
  to foster esprit de corps, a carefully circumscribed release of class
  tensions permissible in the hazardous proximity to the front lines.

<p>
The concert party became a preeminent homosocial ritual affirmed in
the discourse of military regulation. A 1917 pamphlet issued by the
General Staff took note of organized "evening entertainments" as a way
of improving morale.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  In May 1918, <i>Hints on Training,</i> issued by the XVIII Corps,
  positively recommended the establishment of regular divisional theatre
  (<i>TM,</i> 109). Theatre supplemented organized competitive athletics
  and games as a recreational method of building "true soldierly spirit."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  A bottom-up cultural dynamic, concert parties had first evolved early
  in the war in YMCA huts, or spontaneously in the open among soldiers at
  rest or awaiting troop movement. "Once the idea took hold," however,
  "authorities put considerable effort into supporting it. Numbers of
  troupes were usually exempted from all but light duties, becoming
  full-time entertainers" (<i>TM,</i> 95). Designated battalion
  entertainment funds supplemented a nominal admission charge, and
  considerable assets were spent on relatively elaborate costuming
  and set design, as many photographs of troupes reveal. Indeed, the
  war was an incessant "show"; Fuller notes that "no period of rest or
  reserve was

<b></b>

without its ad hoc concerts, at which soldiers would perform, singing,
reciting, conjuring, doing comedy, or ventriloquy" (<i>TM,</i> 99). Thus
the British experienced the war in self-consciously performative terms,
as Paul Fussell points out.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  He does not, however, mention the startling frequency with which
  military men appeared in drag. Such appearances were the eruptive
  manifestation of a matrix of theatrical and sexually dissident
  subcultures that had been evolving for centuries, but which, for the
  first time on a mass scale, emerged as a preeminent form of theatre
  produced by and for men in homosocial formations.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
That drag was a potentially transgressive form of theatrical
presentation during the war did not go unnoticed by <i>Punch.</i>
The working classes at theatrical play were depicted in situations
that at least suggested the idea of homosexual acts performed by men
in masquerade who dressed up to play out heteronormative romantic
situations. The best articulation of this is "Mabel's" pop-eyed panic
in the cartoon published in the 22 May 1918 issue (<a name="1"
HREF="9.1boxwell_res.html#1"> 1</a>). The idea that
cross-dressing could encompass the performance of erotic "acts" between
men was the source of much anxiety-laden humor that was conveniently
displaced onto the working classes, stereotypically represented as
phobic and buffoonish grotesques. In a 21 June 1916 <i>Punch</i> cartoon
(<a name="2" href="9.1boxwell_res.html#2"> 2</a>),
Edwin Morrow expresses anxiety about the transformation of sex and
gender norms in terms of transvestism and perverse gestures, stances,
and costuming. Focused on the "posing" cross-dressed soldier who has
"degenerated" from an ideally masculine and ramrod-stiff Victorian avatar,
this cartoon simultaneously revels in and denounces the carnivalesque
spirit. The cartoonist attempts to recuperate for heterosexual norms the
transformative degeneration of "John" into "Jack" by indicating that
the series of photographic souvenirs has been exchanged between Jack
and his sweetheart "Susie" (formerly "Susannah"), herself the distaff
version of gender/sex inversion in masculine uniform.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Morrow's transformations absolve the cross-dressers of any taint
  of same-sex perversion, as Jack and Susie have each become the
  heterosexually desired Other to the heterosexual self. But his anxiety
  betrays itself at another level. Ever protective of a conservative
  vision of Britain, he uses the "startling contrast" of sex/gender
  <i>bouleversement</i> to demonstrate how thoroughly vulgar the
  modern war is compared to more noble and formal nineteenth-century
  heterosexual romantic gestures. Traditional standards of decorum and
  gender "style" (apparent in the photos' settings) are under siege, and
  <i>Punch</i> uses comedy to stave off reactionary fears about debased
  forms of popular culture that perform a terrifying restylization of
  bodies in wartime. Foremost among these debased cultural practices
  is theatre, with its tenacious traditions of sexual deviance,
  cross-dressing, and ribald comedy.

<p>
That men cross-dressed to entertain other men in the midst of
war was the source of some discomfiture to the arbiters of British
culture. <i>Punch</i> assured its readers that drag did not necessarily
connote homosexual desire or identity (however much it prompted acceptable
expressions of panic among working-class performers like "Mabel"). But
such reassurance was itself governed by the connotative association
between homosexuality and cross-dressing that had been established in
the popular imagination by the outbreak of World War I. This association
could be mined for humor.

<b></b>

Thus the 22nd's presentation of <i>The Chocolate Soldier</i> was
half-mockingly, half-nervously performed, as the program announced,
"With Apologies." Similarly, division Pierrot Troupe leeringly risked
queering itself in the program for its Christmas 1915 all-male pantomime,
<i>Babes in the W(Censored),</i> when it explained that in Act IV, "all
sorts of scenes are seen in this scene--except for the obscene--which
is kept for the Dressing Room." The pun on "scene" depends, necessarily,
on the audience's ability, or willingness, to fantasize about the nature
of the perversion energizing the performance and the comedy.

<p>
Even outside of theatrical environments, the case of Victor Wilson was
typical in establishing the convergence of transitivities of gender
performance and (homo)sexual desires in terms of costuming, gestures,
and acts. The retributive and surveillant forces of the police and
mass media successfully converged in another "GRAVE SCANDAL." "MAN'S
ALLEGED MASQUERADE AS ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE," was the headline of <i>The
Illustrated Police News</i> of 20 July 1916. The story recounted the
"well-deserved punishment" of two years at hard labor for Robert Couthard,
alias "Jennie Gray," the lover of James Blake, alias "James Gray." This
perverse travesty of the heteronormative marriage ritual was the "cover,"
as the tabloid put it, for these outlaws in leading their

immoral life and permitting the house off Lime Street [in Liverpool],
which they occupied as Mr. and Mrs. James Gray, to be used for immoral
traffic.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Detectives Alexander and Lanty deposed they watched the house occupied
by [Couthard and Blake] from May 30 to June 8. Couthard, whose clever
make-up caused both the officers to believe that he was a woman, took
numerous men to the house. When the house was raided on June 8, and the
arrests effected, a considerable sum of money was seized,

</blockquote>

<p>
from theft and blackmail, it is implied.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  The case of Gray and Gray was an especial outrage to the forces of
  law and order. Couthard's criminal and quite successful ("clever")
  "masquerade" was inspired not simply to lure unsuspecting men to
  a homosexual fleecing, but also by the transgressive pleasures
  of exploiting undecidability through appearance ("make-up") and
  costume. There was no question by 1916 that cross-dressing signified
  sexual outlawry, which was especially threatening to Alexander and
  Lanty. Taking over a week to decipher Couthard's "act," the police seem
  to have had difficulty marking the differences between an alluring
  woman and a male homosexual; he must have exercised a destabilizing
  impact on the surveillant gaze of officialdom. <i>The Illustrated
  Police News</i> recited the (unnamed) judge's stern lecture to the
  defendant: "I think it is a great calamity that a man like you should
  be allowed to be at large. Had I the power I would take great care
  that you should not be at large again; but unfortunately I have not
  that power."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The judge asseverated that, thirty years after the Labouch&egrave;re
  Amendment criminalized homosexuality, the cross-dressed homosexual's
  appearance was enough to signify otherwise unarticulable acts of
  gross indecency that merited the maximum punishment of two years at
  hard labor. Couthard was thus imprisoned (however "insufficiently")
  not simply for crimes against another person, but for advertising
  his perversions so ostentatiously--yet so very undecidably--in the
  performance of petty crimes.

<p>
Within a specifically theatrical field of signification, too, the
indelible, if not always acknowledged, connotations between gender-bending
and sexual perversity were drawn before and during the Great War. For
example, the volcanically sensational trial of Noel Pemberton Billing in
June 1918 forced into the open the "secret" of perversions at the heart
of such private theatrical performances as Maud Allan's impersonation
of Wilde's <i>Salom&eacute;</i>.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Pemberton Billing insisted that any participant in theatre outside the
  official censorship restrictions imposed by the Lord Chamberlain's
  Office was ipso facto a pervert, vicariously reveling in criminal
  sexual practices "enacted" (however symbolically) by performers on
  stage, or "instigated" by directions from the text.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  In his opening remarks at the trial, Pemberton Billing announced that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I shall have to bring evidence that in many other cases pantomime is used
by people who lack courage, or who are not sufficiently debased to take
the risk of the crimes [of sodomy and gross indecency] in real life,
and I shall have to satisfy the jury that in this case the passion for
the head of John the Baptist is a clear case of this practice.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In this paranoiac scene, theatre was only surrogate
homosexuality. Pemberton Billing's performance theory was ultimately
persuasive to the jury precisely because it exploited the never fully
spoken acknowledgment that theatre was the appalling sanctuary of

<b></b>

homosexuality. This association had been culturally ingrained and
discursively reproduced since at least the sixteenth century, and
reinforced "interrelated traditions by which the homosexual came to be
characterized as effeminate and the actor ranked as homosexual."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
In the period closer to the Great War, the discursive construction of
homosexual identity was predicated on such an association between theatre,
cross-dressing, and illicit male-male erotic pleasure.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  The Boulton-Park scandal of 1871 definitively linked homosexuality,
  the world of the theatre, and transvestism.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  This link was reconfirmed at the Wilde trial a quarter-century later,
  when it was revealed that many of the male prostitutes with whom Wilde
  consorted had cross-dressing predilections and subsisted on the fringes
  of the West End theatre world. John Watson Preston, a leading light of
  the London homosexual demimonde in the late nineteenth century, "held
  openly transvestite parties, one of which was raided by the police."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  This raid precipitated the arrest of Alfred Taylor, one of Wilde's
  cicerones in the subculture. At the trial, the police deposed that
  women's clothes, a wig, and a brooch were found in Taylor's rooms
  after his arrest, all of which were held to be incriminating evidence
  of his perverted tendencies.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
The delineation of the homosexual as a "separate species" at the end of
the nineteenth century depends on the scrutiny of the well-established
effeminate cross-dressers at the center of a theatrical and bohemian
homosexual metropolitan demimonde in Anglo-American culture.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
  Before Boulton and Park's scandalous performances came to light, two
  men together, in conventional male clothing, would not have aroused any
  suspicion about their sexual orientation or preferences. Cross-dressing
  signaled to the medical and legal communities a new type of male
  sexual being. "In the early stages of concept formation about
  homosexuals," Moe Meyer shows, "acts of cross-dressing became,
  at times, the only distinguishing feature with which to identify
  homosexuals; consequently, many scientists believed that transvestites
  constituted the entire social subgroup" ("UW," 76). And pointing to
  the conclusions reached by George Chauncey's analysis of homosexuality
  in the American navy during World War I, he argues that "it was not
  sexual activity that labeled a man homosexual but his choice and use
  of particular signifying gestures of social role enactment" ("UW,"
  77). As Marjorie Garber demonstrates, "the history of transvestism
  and the history of homosexuality constantly intersect and intertwine,
  both willingly and unwillingly. They cannot simply be disentangled"
  (<i>VI,</i> 131). Thus, cross-dressing did not necessarily guarantee
  itself as a signifying practice of homosexuality; but certainly, by
  the time of the Great War, it could not be divorced from connotations
  of sexual perversity and aberrant desires.

<p>
In the connotative realm male military drag performances take
on their most acute significance and the full implications of
homosexuality manifest themselves within a dominant, militarist, and
heterosexist culture that forbids any open display of male-male erotic
desire. D. A. Miller has explored the signifying potential of "the shadow

<b></b>

kingdom of connotation" for the representation of proscribed desires in
a given dramatic context.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  He asserts that connotation is the dominant signifying practice
  of homophobic cultures, which insistently suppress or negate overt
  representation. Either as intended by the producer or received by the
  audience, connotation can exercise an uncontrollable force, for it
  "has the advantage of constructing an essentially insubstantial
  homosexuality," with "the corresponding inconvenience," for
  heteronormativity, "of tending to raise the ghost all over the place"
  ("AR," 125).

<p>
By 1914 female impersonation both neutralized and energized the
possibility of male homosexuality as a threat within authorized
forms of male homosocial desire. This dual power derives from the
connotative possibilities of drag that instigated a project of quasi
confirmation by refusing to delegitimate theatre's and drag's suspect
traditions. This refusal was itself a source of entertainment. The troupe
aboard <i>H.M.S. Calliope</i>, for example, included the song "So Pretty
a Gentleman Need Never Want a Lady" in its revue <i>One Damned Thing
After Another</i> , a flirtatious and highly suggestive gesture
acknowledging the desirability of men in uniform and the superfluity of
heterosexual courtship rituals in all-male environments. The multiple
entendre of such military theatricality, stemming from its music hall
roots, provided both the traditions and formal structure to elaborate
riotous connotation around the slippages between sex, gender, and
sexual orientation. The program for <i>Babes in the W(Censored)</i>
informed audiences that the ingenue, Marian Machree, was "Necessary in
the show for the Prince to carry on with. Compree?" Of course, this is
an effort to affirm heterosexual romance; but because the romance is
enacted by two soldiers it severely disrupts the "heterosexual matrix,"
to use Judith Butler's term.

<p>
The ever-present possibility that drag has ludic potentialities depends on
the dynamics involved in staging and reception. Because drag was situated
in both a long-standing tradition of carnivalesque entertainments and in
a more recent one of subcultural homosexual formations, male transvestic
theatre performances during the Great War operated in--and incited--a
complex circuit of encoding and decoding. In turn they expanded the
range of desiring gazes and proliferated scopophilic pleasures. Drag
could be transferred to the front lines because its subversive potential
(enabling gay subcultural forms to flourish within and exploit homosocial
arrangements) went hand in hand with its conservative and misogynistic
ability to shore up normative arrangements of sex, gender, and sexuality
in an acutely homophobic context. Because so much material originally
performed by women was recontextualized from contemporary music halls,
revues, and operettas on the home front, and staged in all-male
theatrical locations on the front lines, the process of resiting and
reciting this material affirmed the slippage and connotation upon which
drag capitalized. For example, "Miss" P. R. Morgan, a male member of
the Royal Navy's <i>Timbertown Follies</i> traveling revue, was a hit
with his performance of the popular song "I'll Make a Man of You,"
first performed by a female singer in <i>The Passing Show</i> at the
London Hippodrome in the autumn of 1914.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  A jingoistic but naughtily suggestive appeal to women to use their
  sexual wiles to shame men into enlisting, the verse praises feminine
  powers of persuasion:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I teach the tenderfoot to face the powder
<br />
That adds an added lustre to my skin,
<br />
And I show the raw recruit how to give a chaste salute,
<br />
So when I'm presenting arms he's falling in.
<br />
It makes you almost proud to be a woman
<br />
When you make a strapping soldier of a kid.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But the idea of a sexually aggressive woman recruiting and "initiating"
new soldiers for the military would certainly have taken on additional
valences when performed by a man for the delectation of other men. For the
queer comedic possibilities of Morgan's performance at the front lines
could only have had cultural relevance against a backdrop of spotlit
cross-dressing homosexuals like Victor Wilson, who had a fetishistic
and promiscuous yen for men in uniform. Here is the song's refrain:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
On Sunday I walk out with a soldier.
<br />
On Monday I'm taken by a tar,
<br />
On Tuesday I'm out with a baby Boy Scout,
<br />
On Wednesday a Hussar,
<br />
On Thursday I gang oot wi' a Scottie,
<br />
On Friday the Captain of the Crew.
<br />
But on Saturday I'm willing, if you'll only take a shilling,
<br />
To make a man of any one of you.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
At one level, the requirement for soldiers in drag to perform as public
spectacle in homosocial formations was a seemingly unquestioned--and
rather unexceptional--extension of esprit de corps. But while the
spectacle of a soldier in drag functioned according to the "safety
valve" model of cathartic ritual, the form and content of the drag
performer's "act," strongly dependent as it was on multiple entendre,
close physical contact with other men (both in and out of drag), and
the illusion of eroticized, idealized, and objectified femininity,
disrupted the boundaries that contained the act as a necessary release
in an all-male environment. A spectator's desiring and approving gaze on
a soldier in drag was not simply a matter of pleasure in a "surrogate"
woman; rather, his gaze was directed at an effeminate-acting man in drag,
a fellow soldier in his own military organization. Not a woman, but
another soldier here enacted the unstable role of desired and desirable
"woman." Indeed, as Fuller notes, many soldiers preferred watching men
in drag to "real" female performers, many of whom were able to tour the
front lines, but were not respected since they were outsiders to the
homosocial formation (<i>TM,</i> 106).

<p>
Military theatrical cross-dressing was, therefore, a perfect instantiation
of connotation--the practice, as Miller puts it, in which "insinuations
could be at once developed and denied, where . . . one couldn't be sure
whether homosexuality was being meant at all, but on the chance that
it was, one also learned, along with codes that might be conveying it,
the silence necessary to keep about their deployment" ("AR," 125). Early
modern gay popular culture found its surprisingly secure refuge on stage
in the Great War. Records of wartime courts martial made it clear that
officially-sanctioned paramilitary

<b></b>

theatricals were thickly populated by "perfectly charming and very
affectionate" cross-dressing gay men.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  The rich connotative possibilities of drag enabled the spectator to
  decode what was seen and heard on stage according to what Garber calls
  an "erotics" of interpretation (experienced individually and as part of
  a collective audience) that may be both enjoyable and anxiety-ridden
  while remaining never fully cognate within a homophobic interpretive
  economy (<i>VI,</i> 158).



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
There's Nothing Like a Dame
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The ambiguities that marked cross-dressing on the military stage arose
from varying stylistic traditions that had already evolved in the history
of female impersonation by 1914. Put simply, drag took two divergent
forms, mimicry and mimesis, which governed the interpretive decoding of
the act.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  Mimicry was most visibly embodied in the pantomime "dame" tradition, a
  comedic effort to render the female form in its most hypercarnivalized
  manner: the grotesque, oversized, and voracious body of the raddled,
  "ugly" woman presented on stage out of a misogynistic animus. There
  was no attempt to eroticize the impersonated female body in this
  tradition. Indeed, there was no effort made to "pretend" that this was
  an idealized female body being impersonated. In the grotesque-burlesque
  strain of female impersonation there was never an attempt to convey
  a plausible illusion of the sex being "aped." A perennial component
  of Victorian and Edwardian British music hall, pantomime, and farce,
  the burlesque mimicry of the dame tradition pervaded the military
  camp and shipboard revues during the war. <i>Cinderella,</i> a
  pantomime staged by "The Workshops Entertainers" of the Royal Army
  Medical Corps in December 1916, permitted at least three men to
  cross-dress as the Fairy Godmother and the Ugly Sisters (the title
  role of Cinderella was taken by one Lance Corporal Kay and played
  in the mimetic tradition). Donning the dame's grotesque persona
  was, in effect, a "safe" (de-eroticized) form of cross-dressing
  theatricality, in which desire for the impersonator was drained away
  by the gynephobic comedic motive of restoring sex and gender norms. As
  Laurence Senelick points out, the dame tradition in British theatre
  allowed female impersonation but "offered minimal threat to standard
  gender identities" ("BGT," 80). There was no sexual allure intended
  by the cross-dresser participating in this tradition, only mockery of
  the dame's deluded fantasies that "she" was sexually alluring to other
  men on stage or in the audience. The tradition was maintained because,
  as a late nineteenth-century commentator remarked, "a man in female
  garb is apt to appear awkward and ungainly," and fatally "unsexed."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
But another tradition of female impersonation was well established by
the time of the Great War, one in which sexual appeal was very much
foregrounded. The desire for mimesis in female impersonation was a
strenuous, but illusionistic, effort to align the body of the female
impersonator as closely as possible to the body of an erotically alluring
woman. Lance Corporal Kay as Cinderella would have had to adhere to
this tradition in order to offset the three dames in the pantomime who
provide necessary comic relief. The photographs of the diminutive and
attractive Kay in the Workshops

<b></b>

Entertainers' program depict an ideal recruit for the part. Thus the
Prince's and the Page's songful declarations of adoration and fidelity
("If You Were the Only Girl in the World" and "They Didn't Believe Me")
were not intended as mockery, but had ripe connotative possibility.

<p>
Kay's mimetic portrayal of Cinderella exemplified what Senelick refers
to as "glamour drag." Glamor drag differs from the grotesque mimicry
of the dame tradition in its insistence on representing ("imitating")
idealized femininity as closely as possible.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  Senelick traces the tradition of mimesis to the 1860s, when
  a burgeoning homosexual subculture first gained notoriety and
  public visibility in the Boulton-Park scandal. In the glamor drag
  tradition that had evolved in the last third of the nineteenth century,
  "homosexual men as well as heterosexual transvestites could experiment
  with gender shuffling in a context that won them approbation
  and indulgence; the audience could savor sexually provocative
  behavior because it had been neutralized by the transvestism"
  ("BGT," 93). While Senelick may be correct in allowing for drag's
  neutralizing possibilities, it would be incorrect to deny the
  concomitant possibility that glamor drag can inspire an eroticized and
  identificatory response on the part of the viewer. The glamorous drag
  artist or female impersonator did not exaggerate disparities between
  male and female bodies, but rather attempted to minimize them. Glamor
  drag became ubiquitous for the first time behind the front lines
  during the Great War. And if anything, the special circumstances of
  mass homosocial formations in that context threw into sharp relief
  the wildly unpredictable potential of drag for articulating male-male
  desires across the entire continuum of homosocial desire.

Over the Top Performances
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The panicked, vehement tone adopted by John Brophy and Eric Partridge
in their lexicon, <i>Songs and Slang of the British Soldier</i> ,
gives us grounds for suspicion of their denial of a homoerotic charge
inhering in the spectacle of glamor drag. Defining "leg-show" as the
general term for "vaudeville entertainment," the doughty lexicographers
assert, "Probably no other generation will ever be able to guess at
all the excitement and pleasurable atmosphere of naughtiness generated
between 1914 and 1918 by the word legs."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  They hastily assure us that the term refers to "female legs, of course;
  the other sort were not considered" (ibid.). Their unconvincing postwar
  recuperation of wartime entertainments flies in the face of the sheer
  enormity of cross-dressed theatrical performance during the war.

<p>
Recorded responses to the frequent sight of male body parts (both clothed
and unveiled) attest to the effectiveness of the mimetic power of male
glamor drag during the war. A typical response to mimetic impersonation
of idealized femininity was Major R. S. Cockburn's appraisal of "Kitty
O'Hara" in the 55th Divisional Theatre Company revue <i>Thumbs.</i>
Cockburn wrote to his brother that "Kitty O'Hara--a young girl of
infinite charm and beauty, was prettier than most girls whom you see
on the London stage. It was impossible to think of her as anything else
but a delightful flapper."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  But he recovers his credulity, recognizing the reality of O'Hara's
  masculine body: "She

<b></b>

was really an ordinary, simple Canadian lad of some twenty years who had
been 'over the top' nine times" (ibid.). Lieutenant G. Harvard Thomas,
in training at the 3rd Army Infantry School in January, 1918, informed his
parents about the division's Christmas pantomime, <i>Dick Whittington</i>:
"It was far and away the best I have seen out here. The boy who took the
part of the girl acted so well that it was very difficult to believe it
was actually a man" (qtd. in <i>IW,</i> 155). Closer to the front, the
Gaiety Theatre players of the 26th Division presented a repeat season of
their version of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> as their Christmas 1917 pantomime
to appreciative Army audiences in Macedonia. The theatre program quotes
from a review of the previous years' performances, suggesting a very
willing desire both to suspend disbelief and to delight actively in the
proliferation of gender and sex misalignments, which connote transgressive
sexuality:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In addition to a brilliant male chorus, there is a "beauty chorus," whose
dancing is again a credit to Sergt. Drury. The title-role is played by
P[rivate] Peter Upcher in the accepted principal boy style, and as Susan,
Lance-Corpl. Billie Blowey uses a remarkable soprano voice to advantage.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The dizzying spectacle of Upcher playing a rugged male character (Crusoe)
in conventional pantomime terms (as a young woman) romancing a man
portraying a young woman (Blowey) properly allowed for all kinds of
polymorphous desire and erotically-charged decodings to flourish. The
"principal boy" in British pantomime is a "breeches role" enacted by a
young woman, which would suggest that Upcher's audiences would have had
ample opportunity to objectify his/her legs.

<p>
Obviously carrying on its own successful tradition of glamor drag,
the following year the Gaiety Theatre mounted a new production of a
revue entitled <i>Delightful,</i> an Orientalist extravaganza set in
"Baghdad," in which the ladies of the harem were played by seminaked men;
by men, moreover, who were crossing the boundaries of both sex and race,
and drawing on the minstrel tradition that informs British popular
theatre. The revue staged a carnivalesque scene in another same-sex
erotic space: the harem. The program informs us that "the Harem favorite,
Louana Lou" was played by Private W. Abbott, whose "Eastern Dance" was
"arranged by Private J. Davies."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  The chorus members were required to portray both "Soldiers and Ladies
  of the Harem" (ibid.). (Presumably eunuchs were beyond the pale.) It
  is possible to surmise that female impersonation in this company,
  at least, was not completely dependent on the dame tradition. In
  order for the harem scene to work, the emphasis would most likely
  have been on glamor, particularly during the choreographed dance
  numbers. <i>Delightful</i> staged a T. E. Lawrentian fantasy of the
  sexual availability of the oriental Other, here simultaneously male
  and female.

<p>
Fuller correctly argues that the appeal of soldiers in drag "shows the
intensity of the desire to believe," which sustains the power of mimesis;
but he errs in insisting that such a desire was fully comprehensible
only in heterosexual terms. In his view, drag flourished to provide a
heterosexually-affirming fantasmatic substitute in the absence of the
opposite sex in wartime. Eric Hiscock's memoir <i>The Bells of Hell</i>
 seconds

<b></b>

this explanation by observing that "judging from the way [the men] sat
and goggled at the drag on stage it was obvious that they were indulging
in delightful fantasies that brought them substantial memories of the
girls they had left behind them in London, Manchester, Glasgow, wherever."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
Yet the complex dynamics of men objectifying other men as women does
not occur completely within a heterosexual matrix. Soldiers in frocks
were not, as Hiscock and Fuller suggest, simply mimetically-reproduced
surrogates for the women they left behind. As Kate Davy perceptively
observes, "Female impersonation, while it certainly says something about
women, is primarily about men, addressed to men, and for men."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Operating within circuits of male homosocial desire, the fetishization
  of cross-dressed male bodies drew upon differing dynamics of
  identification than the objectification of female bodies would
  have necessitated. At the very least, the successful performance
  and reception of hyperfemininity in glamor drag exceeded the
  erotic allure contained in--and expressed by--the body of a "mere"
  woman. A more revealing, but wonderfully ambivalent, explanation
  for the mass-acceptance of drag was made by H. C. Owen in his memoir
  <i>Salonica and After</i> : "it all seems to show that English
  beauty is essentially masculine."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  He may well have intended to define female beauty in masculine terms,
  to suggest that British women were at their most beautiful when they
  most looked like men. The slippage that inheres in the statement
  effectively eradicates women's existence: male beauty not only
  exists, but cannot be conceived of in anything other than "masculine"
  terms. Thus there was an ineradicable trace of homoeroticism at the
  heart of drag during the Great War.

<p>
Nonetheless most conventional responses to the spectacle emphasize
the verisimilitude possible in drag. There was an unshakable belief
that men could successfully fulfil the act of embodying the other sex
(in some kind of one-to-one correspondence) that indicates a hunger for
the carnivalesque and redressive capabilities of cross-dressing as an
outlet for frustrated heterosexual desires.

<p>
Drag had more radical potential than this, however. In reality, the
spectacle does not involve the simple suspension of disbelief that
the "woman" is actually a man. Rather, a simultaneous and coterminous
process of avowal and disavowal never loses sight of the fact that the
female impersonator is always-also a man, never not-just a woman. As
Mark Simpson notes, drag is always a pretense, "an ecstasy of surfaces"
that focuses intense scopophilic attention to an "assumed" female body
in order to distract attention away from its male reality.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  A man watching another man in drag must, at some level,
  self-reassuringly avow that the "woman" has a penis. But this act of
  speculation threatens to put the male spectator beyond the boundaries
  of the heterosexual matrix.

<p>
Moreover, in a military environment like that of the Great War, drag
satisfies the psychic demands for a defense against war's potential
unmanning of the male body. This potential unmanning fosters the kind
of castration anxiety that makes men extraordinarily receptive to the
ritual possibility of defending themselves against the loss of "manhood"
through the fetishistic opportunities afforded by drag.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  The transvestite permits the spectator and the performer to "play"
  at giving up the phallus in order

<b></b>

to recover (the illusion of having) the phallus. Thus there is always
a simultaneous acknowledgment that what the man in drag has pretended
to surrender is always really there. In a fundamental way, a psychic and
social dynamic of same-sex identification exists between the performer and
the spectator in the homosocial realm of theatrical cross-dressing. The
drag performance activating incoherent desires in wartime environments
cannot fully or predictably recuperate the act for heterosexual
surrogacy. The inchoate nature of the signifying processes coupled
with anxiety-laden psychic forms of spectator-performer identification
ultimately helped to seal the ruptures between homosexuality and
heterosexuality as well as those between desire and identification.

Carnivalizing Homosocial Desire
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
So far I have argued for the utopian possibilities of the social drama and
delighted in the spectacle of an endorsed homosocial ritual that was so
very patently--but also tantalizingly, elusively--constituted by elements
of "perversion." It is possible to regard the polymorphously perverse
performativity of much military theatre during the Great War in the way
that Richard Dyer conceives of modern popular entertainment. However
much implicated in commercial and politically conservative imperatives,
popular theatrical forms like music hall, revue, pantomime, operetta,
and historical pageant did not unproblematically reproduce the dominant
heterosexual matrix in which male homosocial desire was supposed to
operate. Rather, cross-dressing provided, according to the logic of
redress in the social drama, a "solution" to the crises inhering in a
ruptured homosocial continuum. Dyer sees entertainment as both escape and
wish fulfillment, two fundamentally utopian motivations that express a
culture's sense that "things could be better, that something other than
what it is can be imagined, and may be realized."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  If there was, at some level, a yearning to repair the schisms in the
  continuum that had been discursively produced by the time of the Great
  War, British men in military formations established a space in which
  to escape from confining definitions and proscribed desires. Dyer
  notes that entertainment does not prescribe a "model" of a utopian
  world; "Rather utopianism is contained in the feelings it embodies"
  (<i>OE,</i> 18). Entertainment, he asserts, "presents, head-on as
  it were, what utopia would feel like rather than how it would be
  organized. It thus works at the level of sensibility" (ibid.).

<p>
I want to contend (to second Dyer) that the proliferation of soldiers
and sailors in frocks hardly provided a model of a homo-utopian world
in which the homosocial continuum was restored to some pristine state,
a mythic realm of Theban bands and unashamed soldier-lovers. This would
have been, by 1914, utterly unsustainable. Yet the expression, through
drag, of a male homosocial community less marked by anxiety about the
troubling intimacy of male-male desires and identifications must have
answered to the felt inadequacies of a homophobic society that legally
enforced same-sex social arrangements. As Dyer puts it, "to be effective
the utopian sensibility has to take off from the real experiences of the
audience. Yet to do this, to draw attention to the gap between what is
and what could be, is, ideologically speaking, playing with

<b></b>

fire" (<i>OE,</i> 25-6). There is no question that the spectacle of
soldiers in frocks flirted with dangerous and submerged desires and
anxieties that it only insufficiently clarified and purged. Yet the
cathartic and abreactive staging of transvestic expressions of same-sex
desire, drawing on the subcultural forces that were otherwise alien
to bourgeois, militarist, and heterosexist institutions, permitted
the appearance of marked ambiguity and the emergence of liminal spaces
between breaks in the homo/hetero divide. Those unfortunates excluded
from the therapeutic performance, like "THE EFFEMINATE SOLDIER," Frederick
Wright, the "DESERTER WHO LOVES TO WEAR BEAUTIFUL DRESSES," were pitiful
victims of an otherwise wholly destructive social drama. That Wright and
Victor Wilson had the misfortune to cavort on an unsanctioned "stage"
to a hostile "audience" does not give us cause to posit a completely
dysphoric vision of the cultural processes of maintaining homosexual panic
within the terms of homosocial desire. After all, the transgressive and
disruptive could still be tantalizingly glimpsed out in the limelight on
other, safer stages, however much those stages may have been constructed
on risky foundations. Yet this sanctioned disorder served all the more
to restore the boundaries that provided for the necessary exclusion of
transgressive forces in the formation of social and sexual identity in
postwar British society. This social drama of the homo/hetero divide
would go on to have a very long and successful run.

Drag was pervasive in popular British culture at large during the Great
War (as it seems to be, perdurably); moreover, within theatrical locales,
cross-dressed women were a vital part of dominant forms of popular
culture: viz. the 22 July 1917 theatre page of the weekly [London]
<i>Sunday Pictorial,</i> which announced: "A Male Impersonation:
Next week's first night will be <i>What a Catch!</i> at the Duke of
York's. Mr. Lupino Lane will play principal male, though he may find a
keen rival in Miss Ruby Miller, who will be seen in masculine attire"
(B11). However, the gender upheavals denoted by cross-dressing would have
taken on additional significance in the context of the mass spectacle
of women in military uniform during the war.

to the theatrical in terms of deviant sexuality; Phillip Stubbes, in

resort of sodomites: "Everyone brings another homeward of their way, very
friendly, and in their secret conclaves covertly they play the Sodomite or
worse" (qtd. in <i>NFA,</i> 8). William Prynne, in a 1632 denunciation of
the theatre, asserted that "the putting on of women's array (especially to
act a lascivious, amorous lovesick play upon stage) must needs be sinful,
yea abominable; because it not only excites many adulterous filthy lusts,
both in the actors and spectators . . . but likewise instigates them to
self-pollution and that unnatural Sodomitical sin of uncleanness." Qtd. in

The theatre archives of the Imperial War Museum reveal that some
especially convincing "glamour drag" soldier-divas created a kind of
star system and entire productions were built around these "stars." For
example, one lavishly illustrated <i>Play Pictorial</i> from the war
years featured "The Crumps," an unnamed division's concert party. Their
production of "On the Staff" starred one Private Purkiss, who in scene
after scene is the focus of attraction; e.g. the scene entitled, "The
Arrival of a Lady Upsets the Major." Judging by the photographs Purkiss
was astonishingly effective.

I should emphasize that since theatrical drag seems to occur within
all male homosocial milieux, castration anxiety might seem, rather
strangely, to be endemic to patriarchy's self-created comfort zones. On
a more serious note, the effects of "unmanning" are more immediately and
literally visible in war zones, which may account for the sheer ubiquity
of theatrical cross-dressing in the military at war, at least since
1914 (see B&eacute;rub&eacute;, 67-97). And as many feminist critics
have pointed out (from Virginia Woolf in <i>Three Guineas</i> forward),
military uniform is itself a kind of drag, a costume instantiating and
subverting gender norms.

January 12, 1916 saw a very peculiar drama enacted in the trenches--two
men, who had left their girlfriends back in England, were exchanging a
ritual of kisses:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As we arrived at the barn-door he said, "Just a moment, Frank, before we
go in I've something else to give you,--put that light out." I put the
lamp out and into my pocket, wondering what was coming. Then I felt an
arm round my neck, and the dear lad kissed me once--"that's from Evelyn"
[Cocker's fianc&eacute;e] he said; then he kissed me again and said,
"that's from your Mother." I returned his tender salute and said,
"that's from me." There we were, two men, like a couple of girls,--but
then, there was no one about, and the matter was a sacred one between
us,--<i>andyou</i>.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This is Lieutenant Frank Cocker's letter to his fianc&eacute;e Evelyn
written from the trenches. The exchange of this "tender salute" is an
almost climactic episode in the charged friendship between Cocker and
his "dear Charlie," a relationship that can be pieced together from the
letters he wrote to Evelyn and to his sister, Minnie. What is astonishing
is not so much the nascent homoeroticism but how this kiss between two
men is snugly contained within a heterosexual framework through the trope
of the girlfriend and the mother. With its detailed stage management,
the narrative transmits some of the excitement of the actual moment,
as does Cocker's ready reciprocity with the frank acknowledgment,
"that's from me." Physical demonstrations of such ardor could perhaps
just be contained within the parameters of the

<b></b>

"romantic friendship" that characterized late Victorian culture and
intensified during wartime.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Anxieties about sexuality--or, at least awareness of the surreptitious
  nature of the act ("there was no one about")--are filtered through a
  mock violation of gender categories and their tactile norms with the
  slightly pejorative simile ("two men, like a couple of girls") intended
  to point up silliness rather than deviance. Yet the moment cannot so
  easily be dismissed. If, following the logic of the sentence, "sacred"
  is taken to be a Freudian slip for "secret" the moment hovers curiously
  between the sacrosanct and the furtive. On the other hand, if "sacred"
  is a deliberately chosen word, it might betray an understandably
  overzealous attempt to ward off "profanity," while at the same time,
  maybe unconsciously, echoing the marriage vow. Situated between a
  radical innocence and a transgressive thrill, the exchange mirrors
  a moment of epistemological crisis in the interlocked histories of
  sexuality, gender, and gesture at a crucial moment in modernist history
  and culture. The kiss had just started to be theorized in the realm
  of sexology, which in turn was beginning to be conceptualized by men
  such as Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud. Both would write pioneering
  essays on homosexuality, resulting in the epoch-making conclusion that
  "the sexual object and the sexual aim are merely soldered together."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  It was also the time of the cultural construction of the homosexual,
  or what Alan Sinfield calls "the consolidation of the queer image"
  through a nexus of effeminacy, aestheticism, and decadence.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  The war hero, andwartime bonding, informed by manly sentiments and
  noble ends, were honorably exempt from such base charges and yet,
  as Cocker's letter demonstrates, not without a trace of anxiety. In
  so far as historical constructions shape desire, this epistemological
  uncertainty might well have engendered a greater emotional fluidity:
  maternal empathy, heterosexual romance, and homoerotic frisson merge
  in the kiss. These emotions are complexlyinterrelated and equally
  resonant, defying the strict categories of gender and sexuality.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
In the trenches of World War I, the norms of tactile contact between men
changed profoundly. Mutilation and mortality, loneliness and boredom,
the strain of constant bombardment, the breakdown of language, and
the sense of alienation from home led to a new level of intimacy and
intensity under which the carefully constructed mores of civilian society
broke down. As historian Joanna Bourke has documented, men nursed and
fed their friends when ill, held each other as they danced, and wrapped
blankets around each other, their bodies "spooned" together in sleep.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  In his unpublished memoirs W. A. Quinton recalls how one night, as
  he lay shivering, "old Petch put his overcoat in addition to my own
  over me, taking care to tuck me in as a mother would a child."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 A writer identified only as A. F. B. notes, in <i>The Third Battalion
 Magazine,</i> that Smalley was the great favorite of the Third
 Battalion, AIF for "his heart was as big as his body--his strength
 like a lion's--his touch to the wounded as a woman's."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  Another soldier, Jack, must close his letter to Miss Williams as "my
  <i>wife</i> is in bed &amp; wants me to keep her warm but it is only
  a Palestine wife. another Sussex boy . . . it is very chilly at night
  right now. &amp; it is nice to have someone to keep each other warm."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  A new world of largely nongenital tactile tenderness was opening
  up in which pity, thrill, affection, and eroticism are fused and
  confused depending on the circumstances, degrees of knowledge,
  normative practices, and sexual orientations, as well as the available

<b></b>

models of male-male relationships. Erich Maria Remarque, in <i>All Quiet
on the Western Front,</i> would distill all the intensity and poignancy of
"freundschaft" into this single, silent gesture: "Kat's hands are warm,
I pass my hand under his shoulders in order to rub his temples with some
tea. I feel my fingers becoming moist."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Robert Cedric Sherriff's <i>Journey's End,</i> perhaps the most
  popular war play, culminates in a similarly intense scene of tactile
  tenderness: <i>"Stanhope . . . lightly runs his fingers over Raleigh's
  tousled hair."</i>
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  Similarly, the sense of touch haunts war lyrics, from Rupert Brooke's
  "linked beauty of bodies" to the "full-nerved, still-warm" limbs of
  Wilfred Owen's dying boy and from Siegfried Sassoon's "my fingers
  touch his face" to Robert Nichols's more sentimental "My comrade,
  that you could rest / Your tired body on mine."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
English literary modernism, as marked by the Anglo-American high modernist
canon (T. E. Hulme, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis), is often said to be
fiercely gendered, characterized by a combination of "misogyny and
triumphal masculinism."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  However, the war writings (of Owen, Sassoon, Frederic Manning, Herbert
  Read, David Jones) that appeared in the 1920s and 1930s alongside
  these pieces of more self-consciously avant-garde art provide a more
  complex conception of masculinity. At the center of modernism lies
  the trauma of the Great War.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  If shell shock had been the body language of masculine complaint,
  the poetic efflorescence of the 1920s was the celebration of what
  the Lawrentian hero Mellors famously describes as the "courage of
  physical tenderness" forged among men in the trenches: "I knew it
  with the men. I had to be in touch with them, physically and not go
  back on it. I had to be bodily aware of them and a bit tender to them."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  Bodily intimacy in times of physical extremity led to a state
  of nakedness--in the sense of vulnerability, exposure, and
  dependence--that continued to haunt the returned soldier: "I clasp
  his hand," "he dies in your arms," "I have held strong arms that
  palter," and "I shake you by the shoulder" are recurring phrases in
  war literature. Whether or not there is any conscious or unconscious
  erotic investment in these moments, they indicate a new level of
  intensity and intimacy in male-male relationships. I focus on these
  moments of charged physical contact because they raise questions
  about the relation between the experiential reality of the body
  under physical extremity and the social constructions of gender and
  sexuality. These moments highlight the continuity and overlap between
  different emotions and impulses in the response of men to other men
  during wartime, and show how history--an indistinguishable blend of the
  social and the personal--radically informs and shapes desire. Above
  all, these moments of physical bonding and tactile tenderness during
  trench warfare require us to reconceptualize masculinity, conventional
  gender roles, and notions of same-sex intimacy in postwar England
  in far more significant and subtle ways than have been acknowledged
  in the criticism of war culture, studies of gender and sexuality,
  or the more general histories of the body, intimacy, and gesture.

<p>
Homoeroticism in the Great War is a necessarily gray area, but one that
is intimately associated with issues of gender.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Magnus Hirschfeld, in his chapter on the

<b></b>

subject in <i>The Sexual History of the First World War,</i> alerts us to
that ambiguous zone between male bonding, war camaraderie, and eroticism:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The comradeship which developed between the soldiers who shared all
the trials and dangers of war, this splendid fruit of the war so much
praised by Remarque, must have been especially pleasing to the homosexuals
for obvious reasons. . . . Very frequently, even among normal people,
it penetrated beyond the outer limits of the homoerotic and was thus,
to speak the language of psychoanalysis, characterized by libidinous
components. [<i>SH</i>, 116-7]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Discussion of World War I homoeroticism largely centers on the latter
category of "normal," or rather straight-identified, men who formed
intense and intimate bonds, often with a romantic slant--relationships
that Hirschfeld regards as "unconsciously erotic." By the time of
the Great War, Ellis and Freud had already written their essays on
homosexuality, John Addington Symonds and Hirschfeld were advocating
reforms, and Walt Whitman and Edward Carpenter had introduced a language
of masculine desire into English poetry.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  But older cultural models prevailed over the scientific and literary
  discourses: people had yet to recover from the Oscar Wilde trials,
  and in the public's perception homosexuality was associated with
  the effeminate dandy. In a culture that demonized homosexuality,
  wartime relationships were often honorably exempt, as in the following
  loud disclaimer by Richard Aldington: "Let me at once disabuse the
  eager-eyed Sodomites among my readers by stating emphatically once
  and for all that there was nothing sodomitical in these friendships."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  But other men were more sensitive to the finer shades of
  eroticism. Thus, J. R. Ackerley reminiscences that "my personal
  runners and servants were usually chosen for their looks,"
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  while a character in Robert Graves's play asks, "Do you know how
  a platoon of men will absolutely worship a good-looking gallant
  officer? Of course, they don't realise exactly what's happening,
  neither does he; but it's a very, very strong romantic link."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  Discussion of wartime homoeroticism must take into consideration such
  "very, very strong romantic links," although most of them were perhaps
  as "sentimental" and "chaste" as Graves's Charterhouse friendships.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  "Romantic friendship" (or even "love") is the term used by many
  critics in their discussions of such same-sex intimacy where the
  erotic element is either confused, unknown, or unconscious.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
In so far as World War I has become a literary-historical phenomenon, it
is perhaps possible to "queer" it. Its three major poets, Brooke, Owen,
and Sassoon, had homoerotic encounters, inclinations, or relationships.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  Three of its major prose works, <i>Goodbye to All That,The Middle
  Parts of Fortune,</i> and <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>, were written
  by men who had similar experiences. And three of its major plays,
  <i>Journey's End,Prisoners of War,</i> and <i>But It Still Goes On,</i>
  have homoerotic themes. But any hasty claim for queer politics will
  encounter problems, both circumstantial and epistemological. Though it
  is important to create a dialogue between past experience and present
  awareness, it is important to remember that experiences shared in
  the trenches for three years had almost no parallel in previous wars,
  and that any discussion of gender and sexuality must accord with this
  unique situation.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Central to the construction of sexuality is the idea of the
male-as-subject-of-desire, a tenet that led Michel Foucault to reformulate
his inquiry at the beginning of his second volume of <i>The History
of Sexuality</i>:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In order to understand how the modern individual could experience himself
as the subject of a "sexuality", it was essential first to determine how,
for centuries, Western man had been brought to recognise himself as a
subject of desire.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While this model of subjectivity has been enormously influential
in the discussion of same-sex eroticism from classical Greece to
nineteenth-century England, the fundamental problem with its application
to the war scenario is that the male body in the trenches becomes an
instrument of pain rather than of desire. World War I lasted over four
years and claimed nine million lives; an average of 6,046 men were
killed every day. From the British army alone, 41,000 servicemen had
their limbs amputated and 65,000 were invalided by shell shock.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  Given this context, homoeroticism has to be understood within new
  conceptual parameters and a different economy of emotions. In the
  military, bodily contact is often one of the primary means of fostering
  loyalty, trust, and unity within an army unit. In the trenches of the
  western front, where life expectancy could be as short as a couple of
  weeks, same sex ardor, bodily contact, and (in some cases) eroticism
  should not be understood solely in contrast to heterosexuality, nor
  viewed only through the lenses of gender and sexuality. Such intimacy
  must also be understood to exist <i>as a triumph over death;</i> it
  must be seen as a celebration of life, of young men huddled against
  long winter nights, rotting corpses, and falling shells. Physical
  contact was a transmission of the wonderful assurance of being alive,
  and more sex-specific eroticism, though concomitant, was subsidiary. In
  a world of visual squalor, little gestures--closing a dead comrades'
  eyes, wiping his brow, or holding him in one's arms--were felt as acts
  of supreme beauty that made life worth living. Although these acts
  may overlap with eroticism, such experiences must not be conflated
  with it--nor, for that matter, with the repression or sublimation of
  sexual drives.

<p>
While discussing homosexual writers such as Sassoon, Ackerley, or
Manning, it is important to remember that they were a minority writing
within a masculinist, heterosexual field. Their conception of same-sex
"love" and its relation to sexual identity was very different from ours,
hovering precariously between the Victorian cult of "manly love" and the
"unspeakable bestiality" of the Greeks.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  Moreover, they were mostly young men in extreme circumstances whose
  sexuality was not yet strongly formed, either in relation to erotic
  experiences or to an intellectual tradition of sexual dissidence,
  as was the case for Wilde, Symonds, or Carpenter. Above all,
  sexual orientation, though a very important factor, should not
  always be highlighted at the cost of other nuances of feeling, as
  Paul Fussell does with the following passage from Sassoon's memoirs:
  "As I stepped over one of the Germans an impulse made me lift him up
  from the miserable ditch. Propped against the bank, his blond face
  was undisred, except by mud which I wiped from his eyes and mouth
  with my coat sleeve."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  While discussing the special erotic appeal of blond good looks among
  the (predominantly) homosexual

<b></b>

writers of the period, Fussell suddenly quotes the above passage, noting
that "A dead blond equally fascinates Sassoon" (<i>GW</i>, 276). As Freud
had noted just a year before Sassoon wrote this entry, the aesthetic and
the erotic are closely allied, and (as marked by Edna St Vincent Millay)
might have had a definite relation to Sassoon's pacifist stance.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  But it is reductive to interpret the incident solely, as in
  Fussell's account, in terms of Sassoon's fascination with young
  blond Germans. The moment of tactile tenderness is equally informed
  by recognition of human dignity and waste, a deep feeling of
  <i>caritas</i> and a sudden rush of empathy for the enemy. In a
  poem written on the following day (6 July 1916), Sassoon recounts
  the episode: "Wiped mud from mouth and eyes, and beardless cheek,
  . . . / Till he looked tidy for a hostile corpse!"
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  The mud is an affront to the boy's dignity, rather than his beauty,
  making death "ugly"--"a shameless thing."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  Wiping it off becomes a pitiful attempt to save the human form from
  what Martin Jay has called the "recalcitrant meaninglessness of the
  material universe," especially in a world where men were constantly
  becoming "things."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  Even when both parties are alive and there are more consciously erotic
  (though nongenital) experiences, they must not be understood simply as
  "the correlation between fields of knowledge, types of normativity,
  and forms of subjectivity in a particular culture" but rather aligned
  with a whole range of emotional needs such as succour, sympathy,
  assurance and security as well as states of bodily extremity.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  Consequently, to discuss intense same-sex relations during war, we
  must introduce a different and less distinctly sexualized array of
  emotional intensities and bodily sensations, a continuum of nongenital
  tactile tenderness that goes beyond strict gender divisions, sexual
  binaries, or identity politics.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  We will explore this terrain through the representation of a particular
  kind of tactile contact: the dying kiss.



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Dying Kiss
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
An extremely unstable signifier, forever in danger of slipping from
a sign to a sensation, the kiss was increasingly discussed in fin de
si&egrave;cle culture: "The Curiosities of Kissing" in <i>Galaxy,</i>
xvi (Jul.-Dec. 1873), "The History of Kissing" in <i>Belgravia: An
Illustrated London Magazine,</i> xlvii (Jul.-Oct. 1882), "An Epidemic of
Kisses in America" in <i>Pall Mall Magazine,</i> xviii (May-Aug. 1899),
"The Kiss Poetical" in <i>The Fortnightly Review,</i> lxxxii (Aug. 1904),
"Kiss" in <i>Catholic Encyclopaedia</i> (New York, 1910), and finally
Ellis's "The Origins of the Kiss," in the fourth volume of his monumental
<i>Studies in the Psychology of Sex</i> .
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  But how would the specifically same-sex kiss be perceived at a moment
  when English culture was precariously poised between the Victorian
  cult of "manly love" and the "sodomical" deeds of Oscar Wilde? In
  one of the earliest full-length books on the subject, <i>The Kiss
  and Its History</i> , Christopher Nyrop mentions "the kiss of
  friendship," remembering the "former times" when "the friendly kiss
  was very common with us between man and man," but notes that in recent
  times "the friendly kiss usually occurs only between ladies."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  But wartime extremity suspends normal tactile codes, and the
  male-to-male kiss had been doing its round in the trenches, mostly
  in close proximity to danger and death. "Kissing was

<b></b>

never out of favour" in the trenches, Evelyn muses in Lawrence's
<i>England, My England,</i> as he realizes how he seems "to have one
physical body with the other men," while a world-weary Stanhope in
Sheriff's <i>Journey's End</i>  pleads with Osborne: "Kiss me,
Uncle."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  In Ernest Hemingway's <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> , Rinaldi's
  interactions with Frederic largely revolve around Frederic agreeing
  to a kiss which is denied throughout the novel.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  But the <i>dying</i> kiss had very different connotations. The most
  obvious association would perhaps have been with the kiss by which
  grace is bestowed, varying from the New Testament kiss of peace and
  brotherhood (1 Cor. 16:20., 2 Cor. 12-3) to the transmission of the
  Holy Spirit (Song of Sol. 28:6-7). However, it is important to note
  that in 1924, when most of the war lyrics were appearing in print,
  a young scholar named Stephen Gaselee published an article entitled
  "The Soul in the Kiss" in <i>The Criterion</i> that painstakingly
  traced the classical concept of a mingling and migration of souls
  through the kiss, especially at the point of death.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  For an Englishman the religious and classical connotations of the kiss
  would be overshadowed, perhaps, by a more flesh-and-blood incident
  from national history: Admiral Nelson's famous dying words: "Kiss me,
  Hardy," an image of heroic martyrdom and war camaraderie.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  But what do the trench letters tell us?

<p>
The Reverend Okeden writes to his wife: "I've got a little
secret. . . . One dear lad very badly wounded saw me in the drawing
station and said, 'Hello Padre old sport' and then 'Come and kiss me
Padre' and he put his arms round me and kissed me."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  The Reverend Connor, whose diary reads like a Whitmanesque journal
  in his deep caring and suffering for "dear, dear lads," writes
  on 22 December 1914: "I prayed to God for the dear lad--I said,
  'I'll give you your mother's kiss'--'Let me do it to you,' &amp;
  the dear lad kissed me."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  Similarly, when his close friend Jim dies, a grief-stricken
  Lance-Corporal D. H. Fenton writes to his mother, Mrs Noone:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I suddenly saw Jim reel to the left and fall with a choking sob. I did
what I could for him, but his stout heart had already almost ceased to
beat and death must have been mercifully instantaneous. I held him in my
arms to the end, and when his soul had departed I kissed him twice where
I knew you would have kissed him--on the brow--once for his mother and
once for myself.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The recurring, almost ritualistic phrase "mother's kiss" suggests a
powerful reconceptualization of both masculinity and male-male bonds
through an assumed maternal impulse of security and tenderness, a moment
of "perilous intimacy" to borrow a phrase from Lawrence. The phrase "I
held him in my arms," with the subsequent connection to maternity, is
almost an unconscious reworking of the <i>Pieta,</i> showing how subtly
and how deeply Christian imagery makes up the repertoire of experiential
reality in shared Western culture. If a grieving Saint Veronica had
wiped Christ's brows, Fenton in his moment of loss would go a step
further, planting the kiss of life. And yet there is also a slight,
ever so fleeting hesitancy to specify the bodily part, as if deflecting
it to a maternal prerogative were a subconscious avoidance of the merest
hint of misinterpretation. Yet, it is anachronistic to mark in the kiss
an actively transgressive eros: it is a response based on the perception
of the male body as a seat of pain, frailty,

<b></b>

and transience rather than of desire. Sublimated eroticism, if present,
does not exist at the level of deliberate personal intention, but
results from a deep structural overlap with sentimentalism, tenderness,
and aestheticism that centers on the death of a youth, as in the various
representations of the Deposition of Christ.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  But how does literature describe such moments of intimate emotion? Can
  imaginative reconstructions by soldier-writers help us to understand
  the emotional history of the Great War? I shall examine the motif of
  the dying kiss in fiction, poetry, and the short story in order to show
  the interaction between gender, genre, and psychosexual complexities.

War Camaraderie and the Public School Romance
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The dying kiss appears in war literature perhaps for the first time in
<i>Wooden Crosses</i>  by Roland Dorgel&egrave;s.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
  This kiss was followed by one in Herman Hesse's <i>Demian</i> .
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  But few war novels dwell on the dying kiss as lengthily or as
  passionately as Arthur Newberry Choyce's <i>Lips at the Brim</i>
  .
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  Peter Greshwin and Raymond Dronkel, close friends at school, enlisted
  in the war as officer and soldier respectively; Choyce represents
  school friendship as flowering and fusing into officer-soldier romance
  at the moment of death:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"Lift me higher, Peter--higher up . . . thank God! . . . you're back! I
want . . . to look at you . . . old man." Dumbly Peter raised his head
higher, holding him against his rough tunic, and wiping his lips with
his own numbed fingers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Raymond looked into his eyes, and though Peter was half-dazed with the
tragedy of these last hours, his heart was stirred by the adoration of
friendship that he saw. It was the reallest thing he had known in his
life. "Passing the love of women.". . .
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Five minutes, ten minutes, the officer held him there, staring hard at
the half-closed eyes, without thinking, without moving.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He lowered Raymond to the ground. He felt round his own neck underneath
his shirt for the little silver crucifix which Joyce had sent, and
finding it, he hung it round Ray's neck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Afterwards he drew a deep sobbing breath and bent lower and lower,
pressing his fevered mouth against the damp hair, and the cold, hard
forehead, and the pitiful blood-flecked lips.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The maternal empathy that one notes in the letters of Fenton or Reverend
Connor is here supplanted by a language of desire--fevered mouth,
half-closed eyes, blood-flecked lips--that breaks through the rhetoric
of Christianity, patriotism, or war camaraderie. The theatricality
of the scene is permeated with sentimentalism and sensationalism but
the driving force is a physical frisson that extends well beyond the
limits of school friendship or official duty. The blood-smeared kiss is
the climactic episode in this narrative, in which plot and character
developments are structured around a series of abortive heterosexual
kisses. The relationships between religion, heterosexual romance, and
friendship in the novel are mediated through a series of kisses.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  While sexual innocence on the part of Peter and Raymond, both
  straight-identified males, does not prevent the kiss from being
  distinctly homoerotic, eroticism is understood in

<b></b>

terms of idealization, affection, and ardor rather than as a
straightforward case of repression or sublimation of the sexual drives.

<p>
Parker, speaking of the Victorian creed of Romantic friendship,
notes that "the lush unfolding of a chaste romance between two boys
was clearly considered charming," having "all the agreeable elements
of a clandestine yet carefree affair without the complication of sex"
(<i>OL</i>, 114). Contemporary forms of knowledge, types of normativity,
and ideological pressures play a part not only in the interpretation of
sexual experience, but often underlie the very constitutive structure
of desire.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
  Phrases such as "self-appointed task of devotion," "adoration of
  friendship," "a straight young god with a clean young body," or
  the biblical echo, "Passing the love of women" show that, instead
  of being a simple conflict between physical passion and homophobic
  structures, eroticism is paradoxically a function of ideological
  investments in contemporary discourses: the Victorian cult of manly
  love, the Christian rhetoric of service, the wartime duty of a young
  officer. Love, respect, grief for a friend, a soldier, a martyr:
  all contribute to that mood of extravagant emotionalism of which the
  kiss is the token. The dominant Victorian ideology of religiosity,
  purity, and manliness, which interlocks with each of these discourses
  and claims a moral high ground over heterosexual conjugality, fosters
  the classic "homosocial bond" Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick speaks of in her
  analysis of nineteenth-century male friendships. Joyce becomes the
  mediating agent in this triangulated desire, epitomized in Peter's
  penultimate gesture of taking off Joyce's lovetoken and hanging
  it round Raymond's neck. Given the physicality and sentimentalism
  inherent in the theatre of war and death, the kiss indeed serves
  as a faultline in the contemporary construction of both masculinity
  and male bonding. While in the aggrieved letter of Fenton the kiss is
  more of an act of spontaneity and beauty, in Choyce's highly conscious
  fictional treatment it becomes the fine point where homosociability and
  homoeroticism--the polarities in the Victorian ideological spectrum
  of male relationships--intersect both at the level of experiential
  reality and at that of hermeneutic interpretation.

<p>
Yet the "blood-flecked" kiss may also characterize the genre of public
school romance on which Choyce draws. The public school novels are marked
by a tortured dialectic between earnest homoeroticism and homophobic
paranoia. The founders of the genre, Thomas Hughes and Frederic W. Farrar,
celebrated intense friendships but were always acutely aware of their
physical possibilities: "O Holy Friendship, how awfully a schoolboy can
sometimes desecrate thy name."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  Friendship is celebrated through a language of high romance in novels
  such as J. E. C. Welldon's <i>Gerald Eversley's Friendship</i>
  , H. A. Vachell's <i>The Hill</i> , E. F. Benson's
  <i>David Blaize</i> , or (as in the following passage) Sturgis's
  <i>Tim</i> :



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Tim, listening to the history of these two friends long ago, felt his
love for his friend almost a religion to him . . . "What woman could ever
love him as I do?" thought Tim, as he looked to the seat where Carol
sat. At that moment a sunbeam from some hole high in the roof fell on
the golden curly head which seemed transred; and as Tim's hungry
eyes rested on the face of his friend, he turned towards him and smiled.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



When asked about such fraught relationships, G. H. Rendall, Headmaster of
Charterhouse from 1897 to 1911, said, "My boys are amorous but seldom
erotic" (<i>OL</i>, 106). Affections could be extravagant but were
never allowed to stray into the world of touch. The sheer fragility of
the distinction is revealed through the fierce homophobia this genre
exhibits. In many of the novels, such as Welldon's <i>Gerald Eversley's
Friendship</i>  or Raymond's <i>Tell England</i> , there
is either an episode of "attempted beastliness" or a re of the
"degenerate," as if the sanctity of the central relationship could be
defined only in relationship to such tropes.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
  Even more important was a strict policing of the ambiguous world of
  tactile contact; in the pre-Wildean England of Farrar's <i>Eric</i>
  (1857-8), a scene in which Eric, "stooping down kissed fondly the
  pale white forehead of his friend," drew a negative critical response.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  The <i>Saturday Review</i> complained, "to the infinite indignation
  of all English readers, [the boys] occasionally kiss each other,
  exchanging moreover such endearments as 'dear fellow' and the like."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  The objection here is in fact to effeminacy rather than eroticism,
  but sexual anxiety does lurk in the background. In Hughes's <i>Tom
  Brown at Oxford</i> , after Tom gives up the barmaid and is
  reconciled with Hardy, "Tom rushed across to his friend, dearer to
  him now, and threw his arm round his neck; and if the un-English
  truth must out, had three parts of a mind to kiss the rough face."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
  The male-to-male kiss is "un-English" but, in 1889, just four years
  after the Labouch&egrave;re Amendment, the exact source of anxiety is
  not difficult to guess. Tacked on to the Criminal Law Amendment Act
  , this amendment criminalized homosexuality--or, as it termed it,
  gross indecency between males--with a penalty of up to three years'
  imprisonment. The climactic kiss in Choyce's narrative needs to be
  considered in this context of paranoia. Choyce exploited a contemporary
  historical catastrophe not merely to relegitimize the kiss but to
  display it proudly as the centerpiece of his narrative framework. He
  did not merely suffuse it with all the suppressed romance of the genre,
  skillfully transposing the "hunger" from Tim's eyes to Peter's lips,
  but gave it a decadent slant as well. The physical intimacy between
  Peter and Raymond no doubt collapsed the fine distinction between
  the amorous and the erotic. But such ardor was contained within the
  theatre of war and death, and Choyce knew that a postwar public would
  translate it into a sentimental rhetoric of sacrifice and comradeship.

Trench Poetry and the Language of Sensations

<p>
Amorousness was perhaps permissible among boys but not between men
in Victorian England. The love and grief Lord Alfred Tennyson felt at
the death of Arthur Henry Hallam (A. H. H.) would find expression in
the image of a dying kiss at the center of "In Memoriam" : "I,
falling on his faithful heart, / Would breathing thro' his lips impart /
The life that almost dies in me," only to be attacked by the <i>Times</i>
for a tone of "amatory tenderness."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  Tennyson's violation of Victorian gender norms was what the Victorian
  public must have found peculiarly disturbing and ultimately
  threatening. In his frequent and fluid shift of registers from
  classical models of "manly love" to those of heterosexual romance,
  he compares Arthur to an absent fianc&eacute;e, a

<b></b>

deceased wife, and a bride leaving her parent's house. Whitman, in the
first edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> , would employ a far more
overtly erotic vocabulary to describe same-sex affection--"comrade's
long dwelling kiss"--but would carefully harness the image in a virile
and working class identity or a rhetoric of sacrifice, as in "The Wound
Dresser": "Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Herbert Read turns to this literary tradition in "My Company," one of
the most frequently anthologized war poems, first published in <i>Naked
Warriors</i> . In Read's poem the dying kiss is set exactly in the
central section: "It is not thus I would have him kiss'd / but with the
warm passionate lips / of his comrade here."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  In Read's modernist poetics, Whitman is invoked both for sexual
  and political reasons: erotic charge is made the basis of political
  bonding. Military relationships are here reconceptualized as personal
  romance; killing machines are seen as units of love so that the end
  of the war is like the end of an affair: "O beautiful men, O men I
  loved / O whither are you gone, my company?" Fussell notes that the
  above stanza "seems to recover the world of Whitman's <i>Calamus</i>
  and Drumtaps" (<i>GW,</i> 280). But there is an essential difference
  between the Whitmanesque model the central section posits and the
  rest of the poem:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
You became
<br />
in many acts and quiet observances
<br />
a body and a soul, entire . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I cannot tell
<br />
what time your life became mine:
<br />
perhaps when one summer night
<br />
we halted on the roadside
<br />
in the starlight only
<br />
and you sang your sad home-songs
<br />
dirges which I standing outside you
<br />
coldly condemned.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Perhaps, one night, descending cold
<br />
when rum was mighty acceptable,
<br />
and my doling gave birth to sensual gratitude.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And then our ts: we've fought together
<br />
compact, unanimous
<br />
and I have felt the pride of leadership.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This is the language of the amorous subject, but it draws on the rhetorics
of heterosexual romance, laddish indulgences, and officer-soldier
camaraderie. The shifts in register suggest that these realms,
kept separate in ordinary life through varying discourses of desire,
friendship, and duty have come together. While in "The Wound-dresser"
or in his war journals Whitman is a marginal re, sublimating his
eroticism into little remembered acts of kindness and love, here the
catalyst is clearly not physical charge but rather constant companionship,
growth, and development, as well as

<b></b>

mutual dependence and support. It is a complete fusion of private
and public affections. Manning, in <i>The Middle Parts of Fortune</i>
, speaks of war comradeship as having "an intensity of feeling
which friendship never touches," remembering how "When Evans heard the
Colonel had been left on the wire, he ran back into hell to do what he
could for him."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  Perhaps Read tries to recapture "this intensity of feeling" and
  physical immediacy by returning to Whitman's world, where physical
  passion is the basis of communality. However, the eroticization
  of the kiss does not suggest an actively transgressive politics of
  sexual difference as it does in Whitman, but rather two different,
  although related concepts. First, eroticism is primarily on the
  side of life, meaning, and beauty; it stands in opposition to the
  Baudelairian grotesquery of rotting lips, and subsequent categories
  of homo/hetero are strictly secondary. Secondly, Read's poem asks,
  for a sensitive heterosexual male can emotional intensity accommodate
  the physical? Or, conversely, is heterosexual desire the necessary
  structuring principle of social units?

<p>
If a questioning of heterosexual norms is implicit in Read's model,
Nichols openly employed the motif of the dying kiss in order to challenge
civilian domestic structures. His <i>Ardours and Endurances</i>  was
perhaps the most popular war anthology, rapturously and lengthily reviewed
in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> (12 July 1917)."The Secret,"
although appearing in his second anthology, <i>Aurelia</i> , sums up
the main thrust of <i>Ardours and Endurances</i>: before the war the poet
had been implicated in both "love" and "passion," but in a postwar life he
could find solace in romantically mourning two friends: Richard Pinsent,
an Oxford friend killed at Loos in 1915, and Harold Stuart Gough, killed
at Ypres in 1916. At first glance "The Secret" seems to reproduce the
age-old asymmetrical opposition between male camaraderie and heterosexual
romance, mapping it onto fiercely gendered binaries of strength/weakness,
pain/pleasure, service/comfort, chastity/sex, and mind/body. But in the
last stanza a subtle shift occurs: the difference between male-male and
male-female relationship is predicated not on an absence/presence of the
body but on a <i>distinction</i> between processes of touching. Different
kinds of physicalities and masculinities vie for attention in the poem:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I, that have held strong hands which palter,
<br />
Borne the full weight of limbs that falter,
<br />
Bound live flesh on the surgeon's altar,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
What need have I of woman's hand?
<br />
I, that have felt the dead's embrace;
<br />
I, whose arms were his resting-place;
<br />
I, that have kissed a dead man's face;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ah, but how should you understand
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Now I can only turn away.</i>
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Heterosexual erotic investment is contrasted with noble, altruistic
love of comrades but most astonishing is the process of remembrance and
representation. The gruesome process of bandaging wounds and mutilated
limbs is here fondly cherished, nightmarish experiences are transformed
through language into a fantasy of romance. The

<b></b>

overarching framework of suffering and service (understood in terms of
morality and Christianity, as implied in the phrase "surgeon's altar")
comes up against an almost desirable relish heard in the wording,
sound-pattern, rhythm, and rhyme. This effect is produced not merely
through the liquids and sibilants ("live flesh," "limbs," "strong hands"),
but in the way the falling cadence of the feminine rhyme ("palter" /
"falter" / "altar") is gathered up by a strong masculine subjectivity
grounded in the anaphoric "I" and the alliterative beat of the stressed
syllables of the trochee and the spondee: "Bound" and "Borne." In this
romance of language between two kinds of masculinity, sympathy flows
into empathy, and the "woman's hand," receiving the trochaic stress
at the wrong end of the line, no doubt grates harshly. The kiss is
the climactic point in the poem: if the rhetorical dismissal of the
"woman's hand" is a repudiation of marriage, is kissing the comrade
meant to show that the symbol of heterosexual romance has also lost its
meaning in postwar England?

<p>
The aestheticization of the male body and eroticization of male experience
one notes in Read and Nichols--poets who, unlike Sassoon or Ackerley,
were not overtly concerned with homosexuality--might result from the
effort to find a suitable poetic language with which to articulate the
specificity of war experiences. In journals, diaries, and letters that
are not self-consciously literary or written by public school officers,
one finds a slightly different expression of experience, as in the
unpublished memoirs of W. A. Quinton:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Sharing everything, down to the last cigarette end, the last army biscuit,
the last bit of cover under an enemy bombardment, can you wonder when
I say we almost loved each other. Facing hardships &amp; death together
day after day, brings out that something in a man that lies dormant in
the monotonous round of everyday civilian life. I well remember on one
occasion when I was sickly, how old Petch tried to nurse me. . . . How
at night when I lay shivering, he put his overcoat in addition to my
own over me, taking care to tuck me in as a mother would a child.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Tactile tenderness, red through the maternal embrace, defines the
final moment in Quinton's reconceptualization of male-male bonds premised
on a language of mutual dependence under extreme circumstances. The
bodily intimacy ("stuck together") he suggests is of a different order
from desire. The physical continuum--touching, nursing, reassuring--was
central to these relationships, which did not fit either the classical
or the Christian models of "manly love," both of which largely ignored
the body. Without a language to describe this physicality, most poets
fell back on a model of Whitmanesque passion or Georgian aestheticism,
while at the same time developing a troubled relationship to these
modes. This is evident in the conflict that lies at the heart of Read's
and Nichols's poems: the central disjunction between an experiential
reality and ideology of "greater love" and an inherited poetic language
of exquisite sensations. Having challenged the centrality of desire as
the structuring principle of heterosexual civilian society, most poets
would nonetheless draw on a rhetoric of desire--yet the constant effort
to evoke another experience is perceptible in their language and suggests
a different kind of relationship.

<b></b>

<p>
Perhaps retreat into older poetic modes was the inevitable result of
a conjunction of class politics, literary history, and the culture of
mourning. Jon Silkin's Penguin anthology  shows that what has come
to be regarded as the World War I literary canon was largely built on the
works of public school officer-poets. Many of them had "sentimental and
chaste" but distinctly "homosexual" crushes, as Graves says, at school;
for many of them, the army, with its network of male relationships,
was basically an extension of the public school, and they transposed
the language of school romance with a rhetoric of mourning.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  Morever, from the aestheticism of Walter Pater to the pastoral
  poignancy of A. E. Housman's <i>A Shropshire Lad</i> to the Uranian
  poetry of William Johnson Cory, English poetry was suffused with
  what Fussell calls a tradition of "warm homoeroticism" through which
  the youthful male body was endlessly aestheticized, idealized,
  and eulogized. Sensuousness mixed with pathos as the wistfulness
  of <i>l'amour impossible</i> was deflected into the early death of
  the boy.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
  Most of the war poets eagerly tapped into this tradition, reinstating
  it, through historical contingency, at the heart of English literature
  and culture. If in 1869 a slightly perturbed father of Arthur Hallam,
  after reading Shakespeare's <i>Sonnets,</i> had detected "weakness
  and folly in all excessive and mis-placed affection," in the case of
  war poetry they were "redeemed by the touches of nobler sentiments."
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  If effeminacy had been attached to the profession of the writer in
  Victorian England, the nation now had a group of soldier-poets who
  refuted any such perception.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
  As Aldington says in <i>Death of a Hero,</i> "They were men. There
  was something intensely masculine about them. . . . They had been
  where no woman and no half-man had ever been, could endure to be."
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
  However, his rather shrill foregrounding of the war as an exclusively
  male experience cloaks a deep anxiety about gender and sexuality that
  forms the tortured dialectic of his book.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
  Above all, at a time when nearly a whole generation has been destroyed
  by unimaginable forms of violence, homophobia was checked through the
  sheer intensity of grief. The threat of homoeroticism was arrested by
  the absence of the desired object and the conception of the body as a
  seat of pain. This explains the appeal of the dying kiss: the strength
  and sweetness of a whole tradition of "warm homoeroticism" could be
  gathered into the "warm, passionate" kiss, any direct homoerotic threat
  halted by the image of a dead body. It would always be a one-sided
  narrative, the life-death boundary overpowering transgressive eros,
  such that it could be written into a language of greater love.

<p>
And yet for many homosexuals, it was the source of much anxiety. Sassoon,
tormented by his homosexuality (although he may not have been active at
the time), could not celebrate the "warm, passionate" kiss of comrades
with the ease or fluency of Read or Nichols. Sassoon mentions the dying
kiss only once, but it has a tortured history. By August 1915 Sassoon was
deeply in love with David Cuthbert Thomas, the young Sandhurst subaltern,
whom he calls "Dick Tiltwood" in <i>Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man.</i>
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
  By 18 March 1916 David was dead, hit by a stray bullet in the throat;
  as his biographer, Jean Moorcroft Wilson says, "Without exaggeration,
  Sassoon found the loss almost unbearable."
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
  The entry in Sassoon's diary for the following day reads:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
But they came afterwards and told me that my little Tommy had been hit
by a stray bullet and died last night. When last I saw him, two nights
ago, he had his notebook in his hand, reading my last poem. And I said
good night to him, in the moonlit trenches. Had I but known!--the old,
human-weak cry. Now he comes back to me in memories, like an angel,
with the light in his yellow hair, and I think of him at Cambridge late
August when we lived together four weeks in Pembroke College in rooms
where the previous occupant's name, Paradise, was written above the door.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In May 1916 Sassoon wrote "The Last Meeting," a pastoral elegy mourning
David's death. In a poem where the male body is consistently woven into
a fantasy of space, purity, and disembodiedness, Sassoon concludes with a
surprisingly intimate detail of personal history: "And lips that touched
me once in Paradise."
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
  By framing the kiss, happy with warmly personal details, at the
  climactic point of the pastoral elegy, the poet places his love on
  a continuum of intense male love and loss. If the church, the state,
  and modern sexology had reduced homosexuality to a sin, a crime, or
  an aberration, he falls back on an "honourable" genre that not only
  has the weight of classical antiquity but is incorporated within the
  tradition of "Englishness" from Milton to Shelley to Arnold. But in a
  stunning example of how gay history is erased through homosexual panic,
  either personal or institutional, these lines are found only in the
  original draft sent to Edward Dent. The 1919 collection of <i>War
  Poems</i> (and all subsequent editions) changes the paradisal kiss
  into a dying one: "And youth, that dying, touched my lips to song."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>

<p>
The kiss--or rather its absence--becomes even more fascinating in the
work of Wilfred Owen. Male beauty, often with an erotic charge, is one
of the mainsprings of his poetry.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
  But there are essential differences between Owen's deep homoerotic
  inclination and the more conscious homosexuality of Sassoon. First,
  unlike Sassoon, there is no documented evidence of any homosexual
  relationship or encounter on the part of Owen. For him, in contrast to
  Sassoon and Read, amorous investment impedes rather than facilitates
  political bonding. The noble principle of greater love is forever
  in the danger of being tainted by the "unspeakable vice of the
  Greeks." Still, he is obsessed by lips; a rigorous Protestant ethic
  mingled with feelings of guilty eroticism and a hatred of warfare
  produce tortured sadomasochistic images: "Red lips are not so red /
  As the stained stones kissed by the English dead," or "I saw his
  round mouth's crimson deepen as it fell."
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
  The lips that cannot be touched, morally or legally, can only be
  mutilated in Owen's poetry. Pain and frustration produce a diatribe
  against innocent heterosexual kissing:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
For love is not the binding of fair lips
<br />
With the soft silk of eyes that look and long,
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
By Joy, whose ribbon slips,--
<br />
But wound with war's hard wire whose stakes are strong;

<p>
Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;
<br />
Knit in the webbing of the rifle-thong.
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The concluding images might strike one as a piece of grim war realism,
but in light of his early work, the metaphor is replete with strong
symbolic overtones. Regarding eroticism as "a thorn in the flesh,"
(male) hands had been a perpetual site of intense pleasure and anxiety
for Owen. In "Impromptu," he writes, "Now let me feel the feeling of
this hand / For it is softer than the breasts of girls." Looking back
on what Hibberd calls his "love affair" with Vivian Rampton, however,
he agonizes, "Be better if I had not touched his hand" (<i>OP</i>,
22). These contradictions are gathered up into a moment of terrible
guilt in the rough draft of the "Perseus" fragment: "Unhand me / For I
have touched the god, touch me not."
<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
  Consequently, as he sets out to sing the hymn of sacrificial love,
  the beautiful hands of Rampton and the de la Touch boys, the "groping
  hand" and "beautiful fingers" of "To Eros" or "Impromptu" get savagely
  mutilated. Homoerotic anxieties are thus deflected and displaced,
  painful sacrifice is lauded above pleasurable self-expression. Owen
  redefines love through a sadomasochistic image of mutilation,
  just as the innocuous "ribbon," a seemingly casual reminder of
  heterosexuality, resurfaces with a macabre twist in the image of
  reddened, bruised flesh implicit in the phrase "Knit in the webbing
  of the rifle-thong." Greater love is redefined not through the dying
  kiss but as a bond made by mutilated hands.

<p>
But is homosexuality and the related anxieties about gender that
seem to hover around the dying kiss ever directly addressed by World
War I writers? A unique example is Ludwig T&uuml;gel's short story,
"Over the Top," originally written in German and translated in the
popular anthology, <i>Great War Short Stories</i> , introduced by
Edmund Blunden. The story is set in a tiny dugout on the eve of a fatal
offensive. The first-person narrator reads a letter written by his close
friend Paul to his girlfriend, while Paul lies asleep. When a barrage
starts outside the dugout Paul wakes up in absolute terror:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"You've been reading it, haven't you? You've been reading it?"
<br />
"Yes," I managed to gasp, and I saw him pull the trigger.The bullet
flew past my ear; we struggled and rolled over together. Chest to chest,
head to head, we were lying locked against each other.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't know what happened. We were trying to bite each other's throats
like savage beasts, and our lips met harshly, then relaxed and remained
together. We murmured brokenly, incomprehensibly, as we wept and kissed
and clung. Outside in the front of the dugout they were shouting:
"Take cover! Take cover!"
<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The scene begins as one of male hysteria: the hour of need involves
tortured masculinity, homosocial rivalry, self-loathing, and
sadomasochistic fury. A moment of silence marks the slide into eroticism
in the otherwise detailed narrative: "I don't know what happened,"
as T&uuml;gel shows aggression flowering into desire without a break
or mediating pause. The adjective "harshly" is a curious one. While,
through the logic of the narrative, it follows from the language of
physical aggression ("savage beasts"), it also

<b></b>

suggests something very masculine, with a hint of stubble. Ironically,
in the literary theatre of World War I, Rupert Brooke's vision of "the
rough male blanket of kisses" reaches its apotheosis on the other side
of no man's land.

<p>
The kiss is the pivot on which the story turns, the site of complex
psychosexual mediation. In T&uuml;gel's narrative, the kiss is situated
between two other kisses. The first is the romantic kiss of Paul's
girlfriend--"the lips which you have kissed and which have kissed
you"--and as he prepares to go over the top they are his "dearest
memory." But for the first-person narrator, the kiss takes him much
further back, to the "earliest memory" of his mother: "I remember
you, my own earthly mother. I threw myself on the bed and kissed you,
understanding nothing, but perhaps realising unconsciously that life gives
love and only love can give life" ("OT," 298-9). In <i>Three Essays on the
Theory of Sexuality</i> , Freud says that for the child, "sucking
at his mother's breast has become the prototype of every relation of
love"; initially, "the satisfaction of the erotogenic zone is associated
. . . with the satisfaction of the need for nourishment," but with the
growth of the child, his "oral education" is connected with an emerging
capacity for genital sexuality (<i>CPW,</i> 7:181-2). In a sentence added
in 1915, Freud suggests that the instinct of self-preservation lingers on,
and that sexual activity "does not become independent of them until later"
("OT," 182). The kiss in T&uuml;gel's narrative, exchanged before imminent
death, is almost a regression to the childhood world of "love" and "life"
contained in the infantile <i>Lutscherli.</i> If, as Adam Philips does,
we take Freud's ideas to their extreme, interpreting the kiss to harbor
a "narcissistic intent" (the child unsatisfactorily substituting the
"corresponding part of another's body"), then the dying kiss suggests
an important link between narcissism and homoeroticism. "It's a pity I
can't kiss myself," Freud's child parenthetically exclaims (ibid.). If
this disappointment is the grudge at the root of sexuality, making the
kiss the mouth's elegy to itself, T&uuml;gel presents us with a grim
literalization as the two men go over the top, the kiss being their
last--and lasting--memory.
<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
  While it transports the narrator to the maternal world of comfort
  and security, he also plays the maternal role. However, the framing
  vocabulary oscillates between heterosexual romance and homosocial
  camaraderie: "Paul pressed closely against me, and I sheltered him
  in my arms as once I might have sheltered a woman whom I loved. 'All
  right, old man. All right.' We said no more." ("OT," 297) Refusing to
  be put into any particular category of self-preservation, maternity,
  romance, friendship, or eroticism, different emotions and instincts
  slip through "lips at the brim" in this narrative universe.

<p>
The revolutionary potential of T&uuml;gel's story can be fully appreciated
when placed in the context of contemporary debates about homosexuality,
especially in Germany. The earliest theories of sexual inversion
came from German sexologists--Karl Heinrich Ulrichs and Richard von
Krafft-Ebing--all of whom were seeking a medical explanation, thus
starting the debate about congenital versus acquired sexuality. Having
universally acknowledged homosexuality to be an abnormality, yet having
failed to establish any specific "abnormal" link that could be universally
acknowledged, these highly scrupulous and enlightened thinkers raided
the diverse fields of gender, genetics, and neurology, inadvertently
infecting homosexuality with the terror of each. Ulrichs advanced

<b></b>

the theory of <i>anima muliebris virile corpore inclusa,</i> a female soul
in a male body; Krafft-Ebing, in the twelfth edition of <i>Psychopathia
Sexualis</i> , attributed same-sex desire to neurasthenia induced
by masturbation, abstinence, and other activities; Lombroso associated
the trait with tainted heredity.
<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
  In this context the publication of Ellis's <i>Sexual Inversion</i>
   was a landmark. Although his account is profoundly sympathetic,
  the contemporary sexological conviction almost forces him to conclude
  that "Sexual inversion . . . remains a congenital abnormality, to be
  classed with the other congenital abnormalities which have psychic
  concomitants."
<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
  Freud broke new ground in 1903 by separating the sexual object
  and the sexual aim, thus separating gender from sexuality and
  claiming the polymorphous perversity of human desire. But it is
  often forgotten that Freud became popular only after World War II,
  and it was Ellis's model that was very much in vogue during the
  Great War years. T&uuml;gel's story clears up the tendency to read
  sexual difference through a trope of gender transgression, one of
  the most long-standing confusions in Victorian ideology. By placing
  the kiss in the overtly masculine atmosphere evoked by wrestling
  and death on the battlefield, he subtly discredits both Ulrichs's
  model of a female soul in a male body and the social construction of
  the effeminate dandy associated with Wilde. While the whole debate
  concerning congenital or acquired homosexuality had revolved around
  the concept of intentionality with pleasure as the aim, T&uuml;gel
  does away with this, largely through the selection of a genre that
  focuses only on contingent moments. In his narrative these moments
  are located in the arbitrary and accidental processes of touch. He
  moves beyond the issue of sexual difference to explore the fluidity of
  desire; his story is suggestive of Freud's argument that the sexual
  object and sexual aim are merely soldered together. More importantly,
  he places sexuality in a continuum of emotions such as vulnerability,
  helplessness, fear, and the universal need to be loved and cared
  for. Rather than celebrating T&uuml;gel's story as a gay love song
  of the trenches, it should be read in the context of mutilation and
  mortality. As one of the most commonly accepted modes of intimate
  adult communication, sex also becomes the most available language. In
  the meeting of "lips" the erotics of greed are overwhelmed by the
  reassurances of affection. Words and phrases such as "pressed,"
  "wept," "hand in hand," or the twice-repeated "clung" and "sheltered"
  show the overpowering need of bodily reassurance rather than erotic
  gratification. The kiss--or as Freud defined it, "the particular
  contact . . . between the mucous membrane of the lips of the two
  people concerned," held in "high sexual esteem"--becomes a language
  of support, succor, and solace (<i>CPW</i>, 7:150).

<p>
Of modern subjectivity, Roland Barthes writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
for us the "subject" (since Christianity) <i>is the one who suffers</i>:
where there is a wound, there is a subject: <i>die Wunde! die Wunde!</i>
says Parsifal, thereby becoming "himself"; and the deeper the wound,
at the body's center (at the "heart"), the more the subject becomes a
subject: for the subject is <i>intimacy</i> ("The wound . . . is of a
frightful intimacy").
<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Subjectivity and intimacy return when the body is understood as a seat
of pain rather than pleasure. At stake is the issue of nakedness that
also underlies the relations between

<b></b>

gender, gesture, and intimacy in World War I. The word "nakedness"
suggests how a sense of physical danger can lead to a bodily intimacy and
immediacy that is perhaps inimical to linguistic representation. In the
letter to his girlfriend in T&uuml;gel's story, Paul mentions a curious
episode: "Yesterday Frohlich the bombardier had an attack of madness,
and my friend had to tie him down in the dugout. He called me up to show
me . . . and said, quite calmly: "I'm just telling you in case you've
to do it to me" ("OT," 294). It is one of the greatest ironies that the
world's first industrial war, which brutalized the male body on such an
unprecedented scale, also nurtured the most intensely intimate of male
bonds. The myth of strong, invincible masculinity fostered in the works of
Rudyard Kipling and Rider Haggard, and which was later advocated by men
like Hulme, Lewis, and Pound, and finally embodied in the stolid re
of General Haig exploded in the mud and blood of the western front. A
very different order of male experience, one that accommodated fear,
vulnerability, support, succor, and physical tenderness, sprang up in
its place. The experiences shared in the trenches were undoubtedly one
of the deciding events in the history of twentieth-century gender. They
led to a radical reconceptualization of masculinity and male intimacy
that profoundly affected both the men and women in postwar England.
<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
  For a whole generation of war survivors--including Sassoon,
  Edmund Blunden, Graves, and Eric Maria Remarque--the most
  important relationships in their lives were those forged in the
  trenches. Heterosexuality in postwar England was challenged not by
  sexual dissidence but memories of such relationships. They were not
  composed of romantic love or friendly affection or homoerotic frisson:
  with each of these elements there is a distinct overlap, and yet
  always a distinct difference. Eroticism may or may not have played
  a part, but it was not the founding impulse. Sexuality had not yet
  hijacked an intimate history of human emotions. "Frightful intimacy"
  is perhaps as far as language can go, and the dying kiss was perhaps
  its true sign, the mouth filling the gap left by language.

In light of the current interest in and celebration of bisexuality as
"sexually postmodern," and given the fluidity of Cocker's gesture, one
might read the kiss as being "a re of subversion and disruption" in
the construction of the homo/hetero dyad in wartime England. However, the
kiss in Cocker's narrative wavers not merely between sexual categories
but also between nuanced emotional registers that are historically
contingent; furthermore, placing the kiss on a "bisexual continuum"
requires a shrill identity politics that compromises the complexity and
quirkiness of the act. See Clare Hemmings, "Resituating the Bisexual

Important contemporary information can be obtained from the reports of
the Scientific Humanitarian Committee (Wissenschaftlich-humanitarian
Komitee), a group that began under the auspices of Magnus Hirschfeld to
assist in the legal protection and social defence of homosexuals. Its
quarterly reports appeared under the title "Aus der Kriegszeit,"
during wartime. See Hirschfeld, "Homosexuality and Transvestism in the
Trenches," in <i>The Sexual History of the World War</i> (New York:
Cadillac, 1946); hereafter abbreviated <i>SH.</i> For more recent
treatments of the homoerotic element in war literature, see Paul Fussell,
<i>The Great War and Modern Memory</i> (New York: Oxford University
Press, 1975), 270-309; hereafter abbreviated <i>GW</i>; Martin Taylor,
<i>Lads: Love Poetry of the Trenches</i> (London: Duckworth, 1998), 1-58;
hereafter abbreviated <i>LLP</i>; and Simon Featherstone, <i>War Poetry:
An Introductory Reader</i> (London: Routledge, 1995), 104-15. Weeks,
in <i>Between the Acts: Lives of Homosexual Men, 1885-1967</i> (London:
Routledge, 1991) interviews a World War I soldier who met his partner
in the trenches . Hirschfeld documents similar cases, but agrees
that such examples are few (<i>SH</i>, 115). As Taylor notes, "Given
the physical conditions of the front line, the filth, the lice and the
lack of privacy, and the probable sexual orientation of most soldiers,
it is unlikely that any sexual contact was possible or even desirable"
(<i>LLP,</i> 27). The only reference to a court martial related to
homosexuality I have found appears in a letter from Raymond Asquith
to Lady Diana Manners in September 1916: "I had two terribly strenuous
days--10 hours each before a court martial defending a fellow officer
upon 5 charges of 'homosexualism'-- unsuccessfully. It was terribly
tiring but not entirely unenjoyable as it was easy to make fools of most
of the witnesses (though not unfortunately as to the facts to which they
testified)." (<i>Raymond Asquith, Life and Letters,</i> ed. John Joliffe

acts cannot be explained only in terms of "sensitive urning" souls

This sounds similar to the fluid, indeterminate, and contingent
sexualities and identities that are celebrated in the work of Butler,
Garber, and Sedgwick. But while most contemporary theorists reach their
conclusions by applying various post-structuralist models to gender
studies, I base my findings on an analysis of literary and historical
texts. Due to the peculiarity of war circumstances, the continuum of
nongenital tactile tenderness seems to combine Sedgwick's "homosocial
desire" with certain features of Rich's paradigm of the lesbian continuum
of "resignation, despair, effacement, self-denial." (Adrienne Rich,
"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence," in <i>Blood, Bread
and Poetry: Selected Prose, 1979-1985</i> [London: Virago, 1986], 53-4)
The bonds I examine are not based on triangulated desire, are far more
physical than in Sedgwick, and need not be consciously erotic, nor
associated with power. See Sedgwick, <i>Between Men: English Literature
and Male Homosocial Desire</i> (New York: Columbia University Press,
1985) and Richard Dellamora, <i>Masculine Desire: The Sexual Politics
of Victorian Aestheticism</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina
Press, 1990). "Because of the prevalence of the heterosexual-homosexual
dichotomy, however, straight-identified men today have nearly lost the
possibility of speaking of such relations, and yet there is a continuing
need to do so" (Dellamora, <i>Masculine Desire,</i> 5).

Born in 1897, Arthur Newberry Choyce was commissioned in December, 1916
as a Second Lieutenant in the Ninth Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment,
and served in France, 1917-18. During and after the war he produced many
books of war poetry, such as <i>Crimson Stains</i> , <i>Memory</i>
, and <i>Not Until Gilboa: A Book of Poems</i> ; his books
were often charged with having a lush romantic vocabulary and being
obsessed with the imagery of hands.

In the first flush of adolescent passion, as Peter tries to follow "the
impulse of his lips," Tess throws some forget-me-nots at his face and
runs away. At the end of the narrative, when he is about to kiss Claire,
she says, "God help me! I am Claude Paler's wife" (Choyce, <i>Lips at the
Brim</i>, 197). Similarly, the battle between religious ardor and sexual
passion is fought at a moment when Peter is going to kiss the chalice:
Tess pretends to faint, Peter gets distracted, and the chalice drops to
the floor.

As Dollimore notes, "What is less often conceded or, if conceded,
considered--Bersani being a significant exception--is that if gender
is socially constituted, <i>so too is desire.</i> Desire is informed
by the same oppressive constructions of gender that we would willingly
dispense with. Desire is of its "nature" saturated by the social." See

--Mary Borden, <i>The Forbidden Zone</i>
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/attribution-->
<p>
When Mary Borden died on 2 December 1968, the <i>Times</i> wrote in her
obituary that her novels



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
were stamped by a certain conventionality of outlook. She tried in
time to broaden the field of her observation and imaginative sympathy,
but continued for the most part to make the best use of her talents in
keeping to the type of wealthy and fashionable milieu which for many
years she knew best.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This obituary shockingly overlooks the unconventionality of Borden's art
and life. During World War I and World War II, Borden ran field hospitals,
initially with no prior training. The daughter of a Chicago millionaire,
in 1914 she offered to fund a fully equipped hospital of a hundred beds
herself. While the army provided the doctors and surgeons, she had full
control of

<b></b>

hiring the nurses. After the war, Borden married Sir Edward Spears, the
man who rescued Charles de Gaulle from occupied Paris. She played official
hostess to the British Legation, first in Beirut and then Damascus,
and she received British medals of distinction and the French Legion of
honor for her war work. However, from the publication of her first novel
in 1912 (under the name Bridget McLagen) Borden was foremost a writer.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  Like Edith Wharton, she felt called upon by the war to act and not
  simply to write. Yet her war memoir, <i>The Forbidden Zone,</i>
  shows a fascinating ambivalence about the actions that she took as
  a nurse during wartime.

<p>
Selections from <i>The Forbidden Zone</i> (formerly out of print since
1930) have very recently been republished.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  It is one of the most powerful and one of the most experimental pieces
  of writing to have emerged from the war.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  Although Borden's preface asserts the truth of her account, her method
  is more imagistic than documentary. Indeed, she wrote a surreal memoir
  about the war during a period when most war memoirs were written as
  conventional autobiographies. Neither a record nor a chronicle, nor,
  like May Sinclair's, a series of impressions, her war memoir attempted
  to register the impact of World War I through innovative aesthetic
  strategies. Borden mixes the genres of essay, fiction, and poetry,
  and blurs the lines between documentary and fiction. Beginning with
  the unfocused, muddy fields of Belgium, she portrays war as a series
  of phantasmic dislocations, an apocalyptic landscape marked by the
  posthuman incursion of the war machine. She describes the men and
  women of the war as displaced inhabitants of a strange, hallucinated
  world where people are reduced to bodies and functions. James Kribb
  claims that war texts strive not for "a mere representation," but for
  "an iteration of war," and Borden's text works at this dangerous edge
  of representation.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  She can not claim the eyewitness status of the soldier, nor does
  she remove herself from the field of action. Her experimental and
  fragmented vision of the war dramatizes the limitations inherent
  in the noncombatant's representation of trauma. Simultaneously,
  Borden attempts to go beyond "representation" to "iteration" by using
  strategies of dislocation that destabilize the reader. In this essay
  I chart the ways in which Borden traverses the liminal space of <i>The
  Forbidden Zone,</i> a space that exists between traditional genres and
  modes of representation and that troubles conventional assumptions
  about gender. Her fictionalized memoir thus offers an original and
  profound articulation of a war which evaded easy categorization by
  a writer who did the same.

<p>
In the past decade the study of World War I writing has expanded to
include women writers like Borden who participated as nurses or ambulance
drivers or wrote about war from the home front.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  Indeed, over the last ten years, the myth of the soldier-poet as
  the privileged chronicler of World War I may finally have been laid
  to rest. New anthologies of women's writing from the war period and
  recent critical works have both broadened the canon and prompted a
  substantial revaluation of World War I and its role in the development
  of European modernism.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Formerly, critics such as Paul Fussell, Bernard Bergonzi, and Modris
  Eksteins argued for a vision of war writing as the rejection of
  a prior, more conservative aesthetic for an avant-garde led by the
  soldier-writer, who "became not just the harbinger but the very agent
  of the modern."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<b></b>

Recent critics have focused instead on what Daniel Pick calls "a complex
recapitulation and reshaping of the codes, fictions, fantasies and
philosophies of nineteenth century culture."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  The need for such critical revisions seems almost commonsensical:
  the war had a literary impact which extended beyond those who fought
  in it, and the war itself gave rise to the various and sometimes
  innovative employ of literary genres and strategies already in place.

<p>
World War I broke out in August 1914, and by October war material
dominated the <i>Athenaeum</i>'s list of recent publications. These
initial writings on the war often took traditional forms; the market
was flooded with popular histories such as <i>The Times History of
the War</i> , propaganda including Ford Madox Ford's <i>When
Blood is their Argument</i> , and pamphlets disseminating both
history and propaganda. Fiction writers were not as quick to respond as
pamphleteers, although the poets reacted swiftly and uniformly enough
for their topicality to be mocked in the <i>Little Review.</i>
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  As the war continued, many of the male writers who emerged from
  the trenches employed a documentary tone, drawing authority from
  their eyewitness accounts. Soldier's narratives took traditional
  forms--history, autobiography, documentary--and steered clear of
  aesthetic experiment. Most eschewed even realist fiction, including
  Robert Graves, who claimed that he began <i>Goodbye to All That</i>
  as a novel but felt compelled to stop and rewrite it as what he termed
  "history."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  It remained understood for most writers of prose and fiction (with
  a few exceptions, such as David Jones, the most avant-garde male
  chronicler of the trench experience) that the closer one came to the
  war the more literal one's account.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Feminist critics have argued that women not only wrote about war but
wrote about it differently from men.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  Claire Tylee claims women's war writings "tend to be much wider and
  subtler in scope than battle tales" and the editors of <i>Behind the
  Lines</i> suggest that the "most powerful of women's writings about
  war rely on indirection, or writing 'slant.'"
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  The experimental and fragmentary perspective of the female noncombatant
  thus appears to produce a fuller articulation of war. While women
  could not claim the combatants' eyewitness status, nor directly
  attest to the experience of the trenches, they could explore its
  wider effects. They did not live in the face of the war's presence,
  but the many absences of the war surrounded them, suggesting more
  oblique forms of representation. Thus, first attempts by women to
  write about the war beyond the familiar soldier's story were often
  perceived as tangential. Katherine Mansfield famously criticized
  Virginia Woolf's <i>Night and Day</i>  for failing to take
  the war into account. And <i>Jacob's Room</i>  is indeed more
  about the disappearance of a prewar way of life than about the war
  itself, articulating loss through absence rather than an invocation
  of the front.

<p>
As Margaret Higonnet suggests, women's war writing realigns "the focus
from military to social structures."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  Borden's first published attempt to address the subject of the war took
  a similarly indirect approach. In <i>Four O'Clock and Other Stories</i>
  , war constitutes the subtext of the title story. A middle-aged
  woman named Clarissa Burnaby reflects briefly on her two lost sons
  and on the war's impact on her life and family. Clarissa observes,
  "Nothing terrible could happen to her now, or everything

<b></b>

had happened. It was all over and done and she was sixty and serene
and invulnerable."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  The death of her sons is acknowledged but not faced: "Her mind
  glanced away from this. Would she never be able to face squarely the
  loss of her sons? They were dead. They were dead. Would they never
  die?" (<i>FO,</i> 14). The postwar serenity of the opening lines
  is shown to be a parody of peace. If Clarissa is invulnerable it is
  because she has nothing and is nothing; she has nothing else to lose.

<p>
"Four O'Clock" is a fairly traditional story about social convention,
but in it Borden begins to hint at another way one might speak or write
about the war:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
For [Clarissa] and her husband had become strangers to each other and were
linked by this single, isolated, terrible intimacy of mutual loss. They
were like foreigners who could speak only one phrase of a common language,
and refrained from using it lest it resound like a moan in their empty
home. [ibid.]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The shared language of grief, which is the only language left to Clarissa
and her husband, is described as a moan--not properly language at all,
but a visceral, physical expression of sorrow. The moan attempts to
communicate the incommunicable, to face what cannot be faced.



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Gender and <i>The Forbidden Zone</i>
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Borden comes closer to a moan as a more radical mode of articulation
in <i>The Forbidden Zone.</i> Her book is dedicated to a community of
mourners, and its title raises the specter of war wounds and takes the
healing of the wound as both subject and aim.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  New ties will be forged in a ruined landscape and on slippery ground
  in a contingent and always compromised moment. Borden dramatizes the
  loss of communication between the sexes, yet she dedicates this book to
  the soldiers whom she claims have no need of her message. She outlines
  the uncomfortable space between the civilian and the soldier but also
  shows the narrow partition between the compassionate aid worker and
  the nurse complicit in healing men for the purpose of returning them to
  the front. Her frequent imaging of the doctor and nurse on one side of
  the infirmary and the soldier on the other, suggests that distinctions
  between man and woman in the war were less important than those between
  combatant and noncombatant. She aligns herself with the soldier, yet
  shows her distance from him; she portrays division between the sexes,
  yet points also to the way sex itself is called into question through
  the brutal toll of war, which leaves men wounded rag dolls and women
  psychically neutered. As she begins to approach the subject of the
  war more directly, she experiments with both genre and the gendered
  categories in which the war was often understood. Following Borden's
  lead and that of other critics, I would suggest that dividing the
  front of war writers along gendered lines is insufficient.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  As writers, combatants often used strategies not available to
  noncombatants. For example, while the war memoir conventionally
  insisted on its veracity, the immediacy of its recorded experience,
  and the author's status as eyewitness, the noncombatant writer could
  not claim a similar authority.

<b></b>

<p>
However, although the distinction between combatant and noncombatant did
not always coincide with sexual difference, the distinction itself was
gendered. Borden's operating room is full of impotent, wounded soldiers
whose masculinity is frequently called into question. As Lynne Layton
writes, "both men and women experienced the inability to participate in
the war as impotence and equated it with being female."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  In Wharton's <i>A Son at the Front,</i> the male protagonist, too
  old to t, reminds his friend, "Men of our age are the chorus of
  the tragedy, Dastrey; we can't help ourselves. Every time I open my
  mouth to blame or praise I see myself in white petticoats."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  Further, the wounds that battle inflicted, both physically and
  mentally, left the combatant's masculinity in ruins. Kaja Silverman
  argues that,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Even under the most auspicious of circumstances, moreover, the fiction
of a phallic masculinity generally remains intact only for the duration
of the war. As long as the soldier remains on the battlefield, he is
fortified to some degree by his comrades; the "binding" which can no
longer take place at the level of the ego occurs instead at the level of
the group. . . . But once removed from the battlefront, the traumatized
veteran no longer enjoys the support of his comrades-in-arms. All that
stands between him and the abyss is the paternal imago, within which he
can no longer recognize himself.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Silverman is writing in the aftermath of World War II, but she could as
easily be writing in the wake of World War I. The homosocial community
of the battlefield often creates a temporarily safe space, but once the
soldier returns to civilian life, that security is lost. Many are left in
what the <i>Lancet</i> called without irony the "no-man's land" of psychic
trauma, a space outside--or perhaps between--traditional categories
of masculinity and femininity. Moreover, even on the battlefield, a
physically or psychically wounded soldier suffers from a debility which
leaves him womanish, no longer enough of a "man" for the battle. The
languorous, blinded men of John Singer Sargent's painting <i>Gassed</i>
are aestheticized, but beyond that, are feminized. The white bandages
which bind their eyes point to a deeper, less evident lack.

<p>
The war not only challenged notions of masculinity, but also called into
question the role of women and the very category of the human. Borden
understands that the threatening Other for World War I soldiers was
frequently not woman but machine. Feminist critics have rightly drawn
attention to the variety of women's artistic production during the
war, the strategies which women writers often adopted--including the
interrogation of military structures through social structure--and their
adaptation of more experimental literary approaches. They have not,
however, inquired as often into the ways in which the technology of war
called both gender roles and gender itself into question. Just as the
distinction between combatant and noncombatant destabilized demarcations
of gender, the new technologies of war introduced a new threat to the
human subject. The only triumphant res in Borden's book are the
airplanes that circle like arrogant, triumphant birds in the heavens,
far above the human spectacle of suffering.

<p>
Borden's surreal portraits of soldiers, descriptions of airplanes as
messengers of heaven, and grotesque scarred landscapes convey an aura
of radical displacement that

<b></b>

is carried over into the narrative voice and evoked by the events it
narrates. The title indicates that Borden will go somewhere dangerous and
uncharted. Her dedication is to the zone's other inhabitants, "the poilus
who came that way in 1914-1918" (<i>FZ,</i> i). Her subject is defined
as a murky and undefined space with "no frontier, just a bleeding edge,
trenches" (ibid.). Rather than map or chart this edge, Borden replicates
it--her text might be said to have no real beginning or end. Instead,
it comprises a series of essays, stories, and poems without linear plot,
frontier, or border. The line between truth and fiction is left similarly
undefined. While Borden writes in her preface that "I have not invented
anything in this book," she admits that "I have blurred the bare horror
of facts and softened the reality in spite of myself" (ibid.). "To those
who find these impressions confused," she writes, "I would say that they
are fragments of a great confusion. Any attempt to reduce them to order
would require artifice on my part and would falsify them" (ibid.). To
portray disorder rather than order is more properly mimetic; her sketches,
however surreal, are accurate in the very degree of their surreality. She
relegates "Artifice" to falsehood and her own account to reality, fact,
and truth. But despite her attempts, this is a compromised truth, what
she calls "a dim reality reflected through these pictures"--not the thing
itself (ibid.). Although the book is dedicated to the poilus, she writes
that it is not for them because "they know, not only everything that is
contained in it, but all the rest that can never be written" (ibid.).

<p>
For Borden, fragmentation became the most accurate way to convey
the experience of World War I. <i>The Forbidden Zone</i> is, as if by
default, presented as a kind of montage. The form of the fragment lives
between fiction and autobiography and skirts the line between truth
and fabrication. Read separately, the fragments create brief moments
of empathy and strong visual statements; read together, they comprise a
mosaic of repeated encounters that dramatize the divisions and misprisions
of war. Her book marks the toll that war takes on landscapes, objects,
and bodies. I will move in my discussion from the ravaged locale in which
Borden locates her narrative to the alien machines and dehumanized beings
who inhabit it. Her deliberately dissociated account of the front lines
ends with the promise of new association between the changed inhabitants
of the wartime landscape. Ultimately, however, she recognizes the ways
in which the war has created a gulf between combatant and noncombatant,
and between man and woman. Applying the lessons of nursing to the act
of writing enables her exploration of the forbidden zone, which invites
the reader to bridge both categories of gender and categories of battle
in a quest for memorial and understanding.

War Zones: 
<br />
The Bleeding Edge
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Borden claimed to have written the sketches and poetry in <i>The Forbidden
Zone</i> between 1914 and 1918; the five additional stories were written
later and "recount true episodes that I cannot forget" (ibid.). She begins
with the dislocation of the landscape, which preres and prepares
us for the dislocation of the human. The first sketch, "Belgium," is
written in the present tense, which adds to its sense of immediacy.

<b></b>

The narrator furthers this immediacy by directly addressing the reader
and answering implicit questions, posing as a macabre tour guide in
the war zone: "This is what is left of Belgium. Come, I'll show you"
(<i>FZ,</i> 1). She takes a philosophic tone in her mapping of the
country's devastation, referring to "mud with a broken fragment of a
nation lolling in it" (ibid.). Borden thus begins her book not with
a soldier but with this element: mud, the featureless feature of
the battlefield ground. If the fires of battle evoked hell, mud often
conjured both a hell and an endless purgatory. Artist and soldier Henri
Gaudier-Brezka wrote home that he was reminded of "the third circle of
Dante's inferno."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Among the poems concluding Borden's book is an ode to mud, suggesting
 the song of slime sung by Dante's lethargic inhabitants from the
 depths of their puddle in hell. Borden deliberately opens her book
 by invoking this slippery substance, which literally took the solid
 ground from beneath the soldiers' feet, covering them uniformly in
 slime. The mud in her opening chapter muffles the sounds of battle and
 opens up the channels of the earth like a second flood. Borden writes,
 "there's no frontier, just a bleeding edge, trenches" (<i>FZ,</i>
 1). Mud becomes the dominant feature of the landscape; it is the only
 commodity available in excess, the only thing in constant production,
 for "there is plenty of mud, and a thin silent rain falling to make
 more mud--mud with things lying in it, wheels, broken motors, parts
 of houses, graves" (<i>FZ,</i> 2). The mud drowns the nation, not in
 a clean death by water but in the death of dirt. The country resembles
 a mass grave in the process of decomposition.

<p>
Later in the book, a similarly sodden landscape is evoked, surrounding a
lone, initially undefined structure. The landscape defies maps, familiar
measures of space, and the narrator proclaims herself once again lost,
for "there were no landmarks" (<i>FZ,</i> 111). A series of sheds have
been built on this treacherous and slippery ground, and the narrator
describes them with anxious amazement, as if unable to recognize
the knocked-together structures of a field hospital. Her repeated
question--"What does it mean?"--underscores her feeling of estrangement
and leads the narrator to the final incomprehensible spectacle of the
bodies filling the hospital and the business conducted inside it. The
buildings seem to her the construction of "a new race of men hatched out
of the mud . . . a silly shelter against the wrath of God" (<i>FZ,</i>
112). Unable to comprehend the nature of the buildings, the narrator
speculates that "some dreadful trade is evidently being carried out
here in the wet desert, where a flood has passed and another flood
will come" (<i>FZ,</i> 113). She situates herself and this place not
as post- or pre-apocalypse, but between apocalypses, in the moment
between flood tides, in the interim quiet. Observing men carrying
packages carefully in and out of the huts, she is led to the final,
ghastly expression of incomprehension: "What do you mean by telling me
they are men?" (<i>FZ,</i> 114). Viewed from the estranged eye of the
incredulous narrator, the work of the hospital appears grotesque. She
repeatedly employs metaphors of unethical business: the activity in
the shed is trade, the orderlies are smugglers. The doctors and nurses
are heretical traffickers in life as they choke the breath back into
protesting lungs and return the men to an unrecognizable world--"new
and still and desolate"--in anticipation of the next wave of destruction.

<b></b>

<p>
As Borden travels through the denuded localities of her narrative--the
country, the village, the town square, the road--she takes a deliberately
defamiliarized, bird's-eye view. Like a camera, her gaze opens wide and
then zooms in. The Belgian town that she describes could be any town and
the men, whom she ironically calls heroes, are not named (although we
know that they are soldiers). The boredom on their faces is the emotive
equivalent of the mud on the ground: beyond despair. They are trapped
in a cul-de-sac, "They cannot go back; to go back is to retreat, and
they have been retreating as long as they can remember" (<i>FZ,</i>
9). With this sentence, Borden first limns the double bind of the
soldiers, the generals, the nurses, and the civilians which will be her
major preoccupation. For her this is a war without heroism and without
innocence. Mud begins and concludes the sketch as Borden repeats the
opening image, "mud with a broken fragment of a nation lolling in it"
(<i>FZ,</i> 4). The fragment attests not to new modes of vision, but
to loss, its sharp and broken edges sodden in the surrounding mud--the
"nothing" which muffles and encompasses it. Borden ends the sketch with
the enjoinment, "Come away, for God's sake--come away" (ibid.).

<p>
The image of the sinking landscape is cubist; indeed, the argument could
easily be made that the dominant aesthetic influences on Borden's work
are paintings rather than books. Like a cubist painter, she portrays a
dehumanized and abstracted landscape. Men survive in this world as pale
props or puppets shrunken by the surrounding devastation. Borden was
intimate with Wyndham Lewis, whom she met in 1914. She bought several
paintings from him, and then commissioned him to decorate her drawing
room, a project she cancelled when the war began. For a brief period
of time she was both Lewis's patron and his lover. While the cubist
influence may have stemmed as much from Lewis and Borden's intellectual
circle as from their intimacy, the correlation between Borden's
writing and vorticist and cubist painters such as Lewis and Nevinson
is striking. However, unlike Lewis, Borden retains the specificity of
tragedy as well as its impersonal and sublime dimensions.

<!--_a-head-->
The Strange Plant: 
<br />
(In)Organic War Machine
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Borden's sketches appear strangely enamored with the new technologies of
war. She describes airplanes and warships in richly evocative language,
and mixes organic and inorganic imagery, thus recreating the technologies
of war as natural forces. From this posthuman perspective, soldiers and
civilians are secondary to these engines of war which co-opt their human
cargo and seem to possess their own will-to-power. War machines interrupt
the fairy-tale serenity that begins the second sketch, where "The wide
sweet heaven . . . fill[s] with light" (<i>FZ,</i> 5). Initially,
Borden portrays a town that retains its neatness and defined edges,
evoking "the neat surface of the wide city" with "clean empty streets
[which] cut the city into firm blocks of buildings" and "neat edges
marked by walls and canals" (<i>FZ,</i> 7). Yet this tidiness is prelude
to disaster. An airplane flies "like a ghost" above an exposed plain and
"the doings of men who put their trust in the heavens" (<i>FZ,</i> 5). The
strongly visual and admiring language that follows masks the threatening
violence of its subject; the masts of the warships below resemble "reeds

<b></b>

thickly growing," "the funnels of strange plants," and the airplane
arrives like "a messenger from heaven" (<i>FZ,</i> 6). The beauty of the
scene is finally disturbed by the people, who appear like "distracted
midgets," "vermin," and "the human hive" (ibid.). The airplane, a defiant,
evasive mosquito, drops a bomb, dodges the shrapnel, and disappears into
the sky. The scale of the tragedy is biblical: the earth opens, the men
fall "on their faces like frantic worshipers," and the city seems "as if
it were being attacked by an invisible and gigantic beast" (<i>FZ,</i>
8, 9). Tidiness gives way to chaos, surface to wound, definition to
"ragged edges" (<i>FZ,</i> 9).

<p>
Technology itself appears to be waging war on mankind, a technology which
bears an uncanny resemblance to nature and seems initially benign--this
"strange plant." The mechanical is confused with the natural, and from
the perspective of the airplane, men seem like swarming bugs robbed of
their individuality. Identifying not with a person manning a cockpit
but with the cockpit itself, Borden reinforces the story's posthuman
perspective. The airplane is touched with the gold of the rising sun and
laughs at the destruction it causes, a supernatural and inhuman avatar
of war.

<p>
Borden's stories thus read like new myths for a new and threatening
age. The airplanes are not machines, but beautiful, proud, arrogant
birds; the spy balloon in her third story is a "sky oyster"; the ships
are "reeds." Airplanes were new enough, and theology still culturally
resonant enough, for a battle in the heavens to accrue theological
significance. One did not have to be as extreme as the theosophist Elsa
Barker--who claimed to chart World War I on an astral plane through
a beyond-the-grave war correspondent--in order to imbue the war with
heavenly implications. However, Borden does not borrow heavenly metaphors
simply to portray the power of airplanes and great balloons, but uses them
to indicate that something in the heavens is awry. The war has infected
everything: the heavens, which now hold destruction; the earth, which
has been reduced to bleeding trenches; and even objects as benign as the
cars on the road, which "have gone all wrong." Borden portrays war as
an abomination or distortion in which even "the limousines . . . meant
to carry ladies to places of amusement . . . are carrying generals to
places of killing. . . . They crouch in the square ashamed, deformed,
very weary" (<i>FZ,</i> 14). Through alternately anthropomorphizing the
inanimate object and examining man from the viewpoint of a machine, Borden
dehumanizes man and decentralizes the subject's position. The war co-opts
men into its machine and then exterminates them as if they were vermin.



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Men and Women
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
<i>The Forbidden Zone</i> moves from an emphasis on the wounded landscape
and the godlike machine to the soldiers, generals, nurses, and civilians
inhabiting that landscape. Borden is only tangentially concerned with the
ridiculous generals who "salute each other like wooden toys" and disappear
into buildings, making "elaborate plans of massacre" (ibid.). Her primary
interest lies in the men and women of the war. When she introduces women
in her third chapter, they are engaged in the business of ignoring the
war, in binary opposition to the soldiers: "The business of killing and
the business

<b></b>

of living go on together in the [town] square" and the women,
many pregnant or accompanied by children, undertake the business of
living. Indifferent to the ambulances and motors, they carry on with
the every day, filling the square so completely on Saturdays that
the ambulances can't drive through it. Borden contrasts the animated
public life of the women in the square with the wounded men inside the
ambulances, who "can see nothing and hear nothing of the life that is
going on in the square" (<i>FZ,</i> 16). Yet she does not completely
juxtapose a world of innocence against a world of experience. The women
busily working in the marketplace are--she mentions casually--dressed
in black, and the snug villages "hummed like beehives" only because they
sheltered an army (<i>FZ,</i> 22). Still, this vision of two solitudes,
equally unaware of the other, is a prelude to Borden's description of
their encounter; first in the story of a wounded soldier reunited with
his lover, and second in her depictions of the infirmary, that world
ruled by women and inhabited by the shadows of men.

<p>
Her central story, "The Beach," describes a wounded soldier and his lover
at a deserted beach resort. They sit on the sand alone, each trapped
within themselves. She tries uncertainly to reach out to him. He is in
turn desirous and resentful. The man and woman are unnamed, outlined
only abstractly, and could stand in for any wartime couple. She is naive,
repelled, yet willing to remain loyal; he sits next to her across an abyss
of consciousness. Distracting herself from the wounded and finite man at
her side, she dwells on the beauty of the beach and the sea. Her voice
sounds "like a cricket chirping," betraying the shrillness of her effort
(<i>FZ,</i> 43). When the abandoned beach eventually provokes his ire,
he torments her with the reality of what it has become. He sardonically
remarks of the boardwalk casino that has been converted into a hospital:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
They have a gala night in our casino whenever there's a battle. . . . You
never saw such a crowd. . . . Gamblers, of course, down and outs,
wrecks--all gone to pieces, parts of 'em missing, you know, tops of
their heads gone, or one of their legs. . . . Come closer, I'll whisper
it. Some of them have no faces. [<i>FZ,</i> 46]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While his sadistic account of the casino nights is an act of aggression
rather than communication, her reply--"'Darling, darling'"--constitutes
an act of aggression in a different key. Her entreaty, "'Stop,
darling--darling, stop,'" implores him to be what he is no longer.

<p>
The story concludes by panning smoothly from the couple to the men
and women surrounding them on the beach. The last piece of dialogue
issues from an anonymous bystander: "'They are firing out at sea,'
said someone to someone" (<i>FZ,</i> 50). Just as identity is stripped
from the story's couple, gender is eliminated from this last pair of
interlocutors. What does it matter who speaks? The story ends with the
surreal juxtaposition of the calm sea against the macabre, glittering
spectacle of the transformed casino. Borden ends with the suggestion that
during war, surreality is reality and comes with its own strange beauty:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
How perfect the beach is. The sea is a perfect heavenly blue. Behind
the windows of the casino, under the great crystal chandeliers, men
lie in narrow beds. They lie in queer postures with their greenish
bandages turned up. Their white bandages are reflected in the sombre
gilt mirrors. There is no sound anywhere but the murmur of the sea and
the whispering of the waves on the sand, and the tap tap of a hammer
coming from a great distance across the water, and the bell-buoy that
seems to say, "Darling, darling." [ibid.]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Borden's remarkably detached juxtaposition of the lovely and
grotesque--the calm beauty of the sea, the grand casino, and the wounded
soldiers--is suggestively inconclusive. While the bell-buoy tragically
echoes the soldier's lover in its floating and dispassionate "'darling,
darling'" and the story mocks the woman's distanced and impotent cry of
distress, the final passage also presents it as natural and inevitable
like the continued beauty of the ocean and sky.

<p>
In these two stories, Borden initially presents the experience of men
and women in the war as separated by an enormous gulf. Both the pregnant
women in the square and the young woman on the beach largely represent
the existence of life and innocence alongside the terrors of war. The
wounded soldier and his lover in "The Beach" occupy different spheres of
meaning; his attempts to communicate his experience to her are replete
with hostility. While he is not the same man he was, she has remained the
same woman and the seeming viciousness of her uncomprehending solicitude
wounds him. The lovers cannot cross the ocean of experience which divides
them any more than the bell-buoy, of its own volition, could cross the
sea. Yet this is not Borden's final word on gender relations during
war. She will suggest that to be not-woman in a world where there are
no men is not entirely cause for despair: "There are no men here so why
should I be a woman? There are heads and knees and mangled testicles"
(<i>FZ,</i> 60). In the persona of nurse, the not-woman crosses into
the zone of the not-men and, despite her problematic role, begins to
carve out a relationship to the war which does not divide experience
along gendered lines.



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Conspiracy: 
<br />
Confessions of a War Nurse
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The re of the nurse first appears misleadingly in Borden's book as
"a beautiful animal dressed as a nun and branded with a red cross. Her
shadowy eyes said to the regiment, "I came to the war to nurse you
and comfort you" (<i>FZ,</i> 34). In this early portrait, she is a
confusing and libidinal mix of purity and animality, haunted by her own
demons but secure in her mission to help the soldiers. Yet this nurse,
described in the third person, does not resemble the nurse who narrates
events in the book's later sections. Filtered through the consciousness
of the soldiers, she appears desirable and inaccessible. Yet the nurse
whose voice Borden later narrates is too tired for sex and almost without
gender. The beautiful animal of the first description materializes later
only as death itself, "insatiable, reedy, vilely amorous, lustful,
obscene--she lusts for thebroken bodies we have here" (<i>FZ,</i>
54). In turn, Borden eroticizes the wounded soldiers, emphasizing how
their vulnerability accentuates their sexuality. The title character of

<b></b>

"Enfant de Malheur" has "race, distinction, an exquisite elegance, and,
even in his battered state, the savage grace of a panther" (<i>FZ,</i>
67). The narrator's female gaze dwells on the sight of his wounds:
"The long deep gash in his side made his smooth torso seem the more
incredibly fair and frail" and "the loss of one leg rendered the other
more exquisite with its round polished knee and smooth ankle" (ibid.).

<p>
Yet the "I" who inhabits the central stories in the book has been
transformed into a healing machine, not a desiring subject. Estranged
from the natural, the "scent of new-mown hay" disquiets her; whispering of
"lovely forgotten things," she is at ease with pain: "the cannonade is my
lullaby" and "lulls me to sleep," she says (<i>FZ,</i> 51, 57, 52). She
is most often a creature without past or future, a citizen of the state of
war, past caring, and a slave to routine. Her "I" shifts into the "we" of
the other nurses without dissonance or resistance--one operating as part
of many. The nurse-narrator of "Moonlight" perceives herself as a white
re moving silently toward the gangrene ward, where her ministrations
are laughably ineffective: "She can straighten a pillow, pour drops out
of a bottle, pierce a shrunken side with a needle. She can hold to lips
a cup of cold water" (<i>FZ,</i> 59). Trafficking not in patients but in
body parts, she asks, "Will that land her in heaven one day? I wonder;
I doubt it. She is no longer a woman. She is dead already, just as I
am--really dead, past resurrection" (ibid.). The nurse stifles her own
humanity in order to move among the sick. "[A] machine inhabited by the
ghost of a woman," she exists in a world wholly cut off from memory and
compassion (<i>FZ,</i> 60). Her world has its own logic, rhythms, and
expectations; like any organism, it resists change and desires above
all its own continuity. "There is War on the earth," Borden writes,
"nothing but war, war let loose on the world, War--nothing left in the
whole world but war--War, world without end, amen" (<i>FZ,</i> 58).

<p>
Into this routine steps a new kind of wounded man, an attempted
suicide. "There was something queer," Borden observes, "out of the
ordinary about it, shocking to the surgeons and orderlies" (<i>FZ,</i>
97). They are shaken by "the extraordinary fact that a personal
tragedy had lifted its head above the dead level of mass destruction"
(ibid.). Offering a glimpse outside the logic of the war, which demands
that death result only from service to one's country, the man is required
first to be healed and then put on trial and shot. When the outraged
narrator-nurse protests, the General responds, ludicrously, "Unless the
penalty is what it is--to be court-martialed and shot--the thing would
spread. We'd find ourselves going over the top with battalions of dead
men" (<i>FZ,</i> 102). The nurse subsequently becomes fascinated with
the man, whose body seems a stubborn receptacle of an already vanished
spirit. She learns the secret of his suicide from his only utterance,
"Rosa," which he offers in "a hollow heartbroken voice, issuing from
his blind unconscious mouth, in a long cry--"Rosa, Rosa" (<i>FZ,</i>
99). The nurses bandage his wounded head, and each night he rips the
bandages off in a single and final act of resistance. The nurse-narrator
speculates about the identity of Rosa, imagining her as a lover who has
has been unfaithful or has died. She names the man after the woman's name
he cries, so that, ironically, this "mountainous mass," this "brother
spirit of ox and bullock," begins to appear to her as a "monstrous baby"
(<i>FZ,</i> 95, 94, 104).

<b></b>

<p>
The conflation of the man's object of desire, his reason for suicide,
and his proper name, is particularly suggestive. We are defined by
what we long for, and by what we die for. The man who dies a soldier is
always a soldier. The man who attempts suicide is no longer a soldier,
but lives and dies in a world of personal significance. The nurse who
finally ignores the ripped bandages, leaving his head uncovered until
day and thus allowing the deadly infection to spread, no longer lives by
martial or medical law alone, but recovers something of her own humanity.

<p>
The nurses and doctors are, after all, conspirators. The most bitter of
the sketches, titled "Conspiracy," presents Borden's most explicitly
cynical view of the role of the nurse in battle: "And we send men to
the war again and again, just as long as they will stand it; just until
they are dead, and then we throw them into the ground" (<i>FZ,</i>
117). "Conspiracy" outlines the story of a man who has shot himself in
the mouth but is still alive. The doctors are trying to save him, but,
like "Rosa," if he recovers he will be court-martialed and sentenced to
death. His is only an extreme version of every patient's story, since
each is mended and then sent out to die. The nurses thus play "a dreadful
game of hide-and-seek among the wounded," searching out the ones who are
slipping and drawing them back to life (<i>FZ,</i> 151). They conspire
against the patient's "right to die" by violating his already wounded
body (<i>FZ,</i> 119). Borden observes, "to the shame of the havoc of his
limbs we add the insult of our curiosity and the curse of our purpose"
(<i>FZ,</i> 120). In "Conspiracy," the nurses and surgeons are protected
by their obliviousness and bright paraphernalia. They are automatons who
sacrifice their own humanity in order to carry out this struggle. In
a rare moment of retrospection, Borden looks back at her former self
and thinks, "I think that woman, myself, must have been in a trance,
or under some horrid spell" (<i>FZ,</i> 151).

<p>
Borden's choice to portray the nurse and the male patient in these
stories, rather than the civilian woman and the active combatant, situates
her in a sequestered zone between the home front and the front line,
as well as between traditionally gendered roles. Gender itself has been
wounded; and the men and women of the field hospital do not recognize
each other as men and women but as nurses, doctors, patients, the dead,
the dying, and the not yet dying. They inhabit an unreal world where
old categories of identification are suspended and people are reduced
to bodies and functions. Yet even in this desolate wasteland, moments
of connection and communication are forged: a merciful nurse allows
a soldier to die; a woman standing beside a blind man in a crowded
ward holds his hand so that he knows he is not alone; a rabbi holds a
crucifix and seamlessly takes the place of a priest who falls on the
battlefield while giving absolution to a dying man. However, although
the narrator searches for these moments of connection, she distrusts
them. They disturb the automatic workings of the nurse, slip past the
logic of statistical casualty, and threaten sanity. Borden's position,
then, vacillates between the perspective of an uncomprehending outsider
and an unquestioning, almost unconscious insider. Each of these subject
positions most often excludes the possibility of connection, such that
when connection does occur, it creates the exception that threatens the
whole edifice of the war.

Why Does One Write (of War)
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
In "Why Does One Write," Primo Levi delineates a number of reasons for
the production of a literary work. Among these are the financial, the
therapeutic, and the ideological. While Levi recognizes the appeal of the
therapeutic, and indeed even claims to have been motivated by the need
for therapy himself, he begs the writer to maintain communication with
the reader: "I ask him, however, to make an effort to filter his anguish,
not to fling it as it is, rough and raw, into the face of the reader."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  For Levi, Paul Celan represents the writer who fails to communicate and
  thus fails his sacred trust to order incomprehensible experience. In
  "On Obscure Writing," Levi berates Celan for alienating his
  audience. His writing "attracts us like chasms attract us, but at the
  same time it also defrauds us of something that should have been said
  and was not, and so it frustrates us and turns us away."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  Finally, Levi describes Celan's language as a "howl," a "dark and
  truncated language precisely like that of a person who is about to
  die and is alone" (ibid.).

<p>
I am reminded of Borden's first attempt to write about the war in the
story of Clarissa Burnaby and her husband, whose loss of their sons has
left them only the common language of sorrow, a moan or howl. Similarly,
in "Rosa," the suicidal soldier's language is reduced to naming the
object of his loss. The story particularly dramatizes the dynamic of
the howl as a communication without content or context, a stripped
down articulation of pain. The howl in the story gives rise only to
speculation and interpretation--regarding the identity of "Rosa," the
reason behind his suicide, the history of their relationship--but its
content remains forever inaccessible. There is no way to reconstruct a
story from a moan, and indeed, the man's cry calls for empathy, rather
than interpretation. It is empathy that finally keeps the nurse from
rebinding the bandage on his head, allowing the soldier to finish the
business of his dying in peace. Borden does not invite our understanding;
she blocks it. She attempts to bridge the gender and genre divide--not
to explain one form of life to another, but to inspire empathy, the
only kind of memorial that allows the dead to retain the privacy and
integrity of their silence and enables the living to retain their links
to one another and to the dead.

Margaret Higonnet's edited collection, <i>Nurses at the Front: Writing
the Wounds of the Great War</i> (Boston: Northeastern University
Press, 2001) excerpts the war writings of Borden and Ellen La Motte,
who worked together on the frontline at H&ocirc;pital Chirurgical
Mobile No. I. Higonnet points to "striking parallels between the two
collections," particularly in their "bitter irony" of tone, their loosely
autobiographical narrative, and their unconventional treatment of the
subject matter. Higonnet emphasizes the way in which these two nurses
and writers "expose wounds" of war, and in doing so, take "a first step"
in healing them. Until the publication of Higonnet's anthology, <i>The
Forbidden Zone</i> , Borden's most powerful book, had been out of
print since 1930. Higonnet's anthology, however, downplays the length
and breadth of Borden's literary career and her considerable differences
from La Motte by presenting the two women generically, as her title
indicates, as "nurses at the front." By leaving out many of the opening
vignettes of Borden's book and all of the poetry with which the book
concludes, Higonnet edits the wartime sketches to further emphasize their
similarities. However, when these books are read in full they create quite
a different impression. La Motte's is more reportorial, more consistently
ironic, and more even in tone and genre, whereas Borden's employs three
different genres--prose poem, short story, and free verse--and veers
wildly in tone from the gently whimsical to the professionally detached
to the sentimentally engaged. La Motte's disillusionment is predictable
in a way that Borden's is not; Borden crosses more boundaries, takes
more risks, and while she does not always do so with complete success,
she does so with talent and originality.

Higonnet also makes the point in her introduction to <i>Nurses at

<p>
<a name="FOOT21" href="#REF21">21</a>.
The reaction against gender-based criticism of war literature has
already begun. In <i>Modernism, History and the First World War</i>
, Trudi Tate writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I am not trying to produce a taxonomy of war writings, nor to make a case
for "women's writing" or "men's writing"; I am increasingly convinced
that this kind of category obscures more than it illuminates. The works
I discuss are preoccupied with questions of who has seen what, and how
one is positioned in relation to war's trauma. [5]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Tate shifts the focus from questions of gender to questions of trauma and
representation and claims that "these concerns often far outweigh those of
gender and sexual difference" (ibid.). Her readings, however, are still
deeply concerned with the role of gender, despite her introduction's
claim. Her work has helped establish a recognition of the complexity and
multivalence of the term "trauma" itself. Interestingly, Tate does not
spend much time on Borden, although Borden is centrally and productively
preoccupied with the questions Tate raises. Ruth Leys's recent study of
trauma, <i>Trauma: A Genealogy</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
2000) also deals with the term's multivalence.

<p>
Six weeks after <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> appeared, its author speculated on
"a new name" for her novels: "A new ___ by Virginia Woolf. . . . Elegy?"
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  In modernizing the elegy by adapting its poetics to prose fiction and
  its work of mourning to postwar London's post-theological cosmos in
  <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> , Woolf moves beyond what Alex Zwerdling
  calls her "satiric elegy," <i>Jacob's Room</i> , to discover
  and explore the genre's full profundity, complexity, and power.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  This communal elegy

<b></b>

unseals "a well of tears"--for the survivors no less than the war
dead--and enters into colloquy with the pastoral elegy from the Greeks
through Shakespeare to Shelley in search of consolations for "This late
age of the world's experience."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  In making Clarissa Dalloway its central elegiac consciousness and in
  transposing certain gender-inflected conventions to feminine registers,
  furthermore, the novel embraces the terrible losses that the war
  inflicted on "poor devils, of both sexes" and critiques the warmaking
  society that <i>Three Guineas</i>  res as "a father."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  But what distinguishes <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> as a war elegy is its
  discovery of the genre's deep resources for dramatizing and mediating
  violence both psychic and social: the violence of war and of everyday
  death; the violence of everyday life; and the violence intrinsic
  to mourning, the grief-driven rage that threatens to derail the
  mourner's progress toward acceptance and consolation. In making the
  elegy a field for confronting the violence that had devastated Europe
  and still loomed as a threat to its future, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>
  joins the internationalist contributions of Woolf's Bloomsbury
  contemporaries John Maynard Keynes and Sigmund Freud to postwar
  debates about Europe's future. Its characters' struggles animate
  Keynes's prophetic castigation of the Peace as war by other means
  and anticipate Freud's arguments against class oppression, and for
  the consolations of science, philosophy, and art over "religious
  illusion," for a civilization that must manage but can never eradicate
  the aggression that imperils it from within.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
In approaching <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> as a communal postwar elegy, I rely on
Peter Sacks's psychosocial analysis of the classical elegy as a dynamic,
eventful working through of loss, fraught with real dangers. Sacks shows
how the genre's conventions mediate the mourner's arduous journey from
loss, grief, and rage to the renewed life and hope epitomized in the
final line of John Milton's "Lycidas," "Tomorrow to fresh woods and
pastures new."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  Three features stand out in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s exploration
  of violence. First, with roots in ancient fertility rites, the
  classical pastoral elegy res the work of mourning through
  ceremonies surrounding the death and rebirth of a vegetation god
  such as Adonis, and its dialectical movement toward consolation
  (always necessarily symbolic) recalls the funeral games and contests
  through which a community of mourners negotiates its inheritance
  from dead father-res or paternal deities. Mourning, then, has
  an oedipal dimension as the immediate loss reawakens old crises of
  loss and brokenness, early wounds to narcissism and sexuality that
  psychoanalysis res as castration. To mourn is to relive every loss
  back to the first loss of the mother and to suffer again the anguish of
  submitting to the reality principle red as the law of the father.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  As we shall see, the accidental death of Clarissa's sister
  Sylvia--caused, it seems, by their careless father--feminizes the
  vegetation myth as Sylvia becomes the matrix of Clarissa's homemade
  consolation. Moreover, Clarissa herself "survives" her historical
  prototype Kitty Maxse's death to body forth the "divine vitality"
  that the elegy seeks to recover, while her double, the (partly
  autobiographical) war veteran Septimus, suffers a death that enacts
  a potentially redemptive "message" of witness to social violence
  (<i>MD,</i> 7, 83). In exploring its characters' conflicts with
  a society that is "a father," <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> analyzes a
  civilization founded, as Freud shows, on the sacrifice of female
  desire and lends critical substance to his prediction that the war's
  survivors will perhaps rebuild their shattered civilization "on firmer
  ground and more lastingly."

<b></b>

<p>
Second, in correlating the elegy's formal conventions with the painful
work of mourning, Sacks contrasts the elegy with its bad other, revenge
tragedy. The poetic elegy submits mourning's formidable psychic turbulence
to the rigorous formal mechanics of elegiac temporality. Meter, rhyme,
repetition, refrain, repeated questions, procession, and ceremony:
all serve to divide, order, pace, tame, channel the mourner's chaos of
feelings. This finely elaborated order indirectly attests to the dangers
that threaten the mourner's progress: on one side, melancholia--the
refusal to relinquish the lost one, to submit to reality, to attach one's
desire to a substitute object; on the other, the rage that may explode
the genre's bounds, veer from symbolic expression to actual murder or
suicide, pervert symbolic consolation into sacrificial violence in the
failed mourning of revenge tragedy. In <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> as looser
structures of repetition and refrain (Big Ben's striking of the hours,
"Fear no more the heat o' the sun") mark their progress through the
day, the characters battle psychic perils that write small the great
crisis of loss, grief, and anger facing postwar Europe. Miss Kilman,
impoverished because of her German ancestry, is beset by violent rage;
Septimus's experience of his society's disavowed violence is labeled
madness; Clarissa feels almost annihilated by existential doubt. Through
them <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> poses the great question of Europe's future
after what was not yet World War I (the novel calls it "the European
War") as the fate of collective mourning--a <i>historic</i> question of
genre for a traumatized Europe poised between elegy and revenge tragedy
(<i>MD,</i> 85).

<p>
Third, in keeping with the pastoral elegy's eclogic division of mourning
voices, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> projects the dialectic of mourning into
urgent social critique and contestation of the future.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  The funeral games and "apparently innocent" singing matches of
  elegiac tradition, Sacks observes, channel grief into skilled
  performances that contest and carry on those virtues of the dead
  "deemed important for the community's survival" (<i>EE,</i> 36). In
  the novel's depiction of a great European capital five years after the
  war, an intricate tournament of such "poetry contests" pits Clarissa's
  "atheist's religion" against Miss Kilman's allegiances to God and
  Russia; Septimus's prophetic witness against his prosperous doctors'
  policy of "Conversion" to social norms; the furtively sexual Hugh
  Whitbread against the telling silences of Sally Seton and Milly Brush
  (<i>EE,</i> 36; <i>MD,</i> 78, 100). I shall first trace Clarissa's
  emergence as an elegiac consciousness from <i>The Voyage Out</i> 
  to <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> and then locate the novel's intramural poetry
  contests within public debates about postwar Europe's inheritance
  and future that took place in and beyond Bloomsbury. Addressing the
  communal task--not yet negated by events--of navigating beyond anger
  and revenge toward peace, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> conjures from the
  "beautiful caves" of its characters' grief-ravaged psyches vistas of
  fresh woods and pastures new (<i>D,</i> 2:263, 30 August 1923).

Life-Drawing after Death
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Set on a June day in 1923, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> emerged amid an outpouring
of art after a war that military historian John Keegan describes as a
"tragic and unnecessary conflict," which mobilized sixty-five million,
killed over eight million, left twenty-one million

<b></b>

physically and/or psychically wounded or disabled, and blighted the
lives and hopes of uncounted loved ones.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  A voice in T. S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>  marvels of
  a crowd streaming over London Bridge, "I had not thought death had
  undone so many"; to Lucrezia Warren Smith it seems that "Every one has
  friends who were killed in the War" (<i>MD,</i> 66). The war not only
  shattered millions of lives but unleashed virulent nationalisms that
  rent the economic and cultural fabric of what had been becoming an
  increasingly international civilization. For Keynes, Leonard Woolf,
  Clive Bell, Albert Einstein, and others, it was a "Civil War" that
  threatened "the end of a civilization."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Yet even as it negated Europe's Enlightenment legacy of reason, it also
  razed four ancient empires, dismantled an outworn social and political
  order, and left Europe "'a laboratory atop a vast graveyard,'" in
  which communism, fascism, and liberal democracy vied to promise the
  suddenly enfranchised masses "a New Order"--and "it was not preordained
  that democracy should win out over fascism and communism."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
By 1923, Freud's early confidence that Europeans would rebuild and perhaps
improve their democratic and internationalist civilization after the war
was losing ground to the totalitarian political orders that, fostered
by the Versailles Treaty, were already beginning to form.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  On visiting postwar Austria, British diplomat Harold Nicolson reported,
  "Everyone looks very pinched and yellow: no fats for four years. The
  other side of the blockade. . . . I feel that my plump pink face is
  an insult to these wretched people."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  A fewyears later, Peter Walsh returns from India to a civilization
  that seems a "dear . . . personalpossession," a London pulsing
  with the resurgent creativity--"design, art, everywhere"--and
  commercial prosperity of the 1920s (<i>MD,</i> 55, 71). Through
  the great and small eventsthat befall its characters this June day,
  <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> portrays a postwar civilization fraught with
  agonizing social contradictions, yet vibrating with the vital force
  of the future.

<p>
Could the elegy rise to this historic moment--mourn war losses of
unimaginable magnitude yet everywhere suffered as local, capture
contending social forces, work through communal grief toward consolation
and hope? The "moderns" Clarissa rejects in "Mrs. Dalloway on Bond Street"
suggest not ("The moderns had never written anything one wanted to read
about death").
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  In the war poets' harrowing turns on the genre, savage ironies all but
  eclipse consolation: Wilfred Owen's nightmarish "Dulce et Decorum Est";
  the proleptic self-elegies of Rupert Brooke ("The Soldier"), Isaac
  Rosenberg ("Break of Day in the Trenches"), and Yeats's Major Robert
  Gregory ("An Irish Airman Foresees His Death"); Siegfried Sassoon's
  "Everyone Sang," with its stunning reversal of the mourner's progress
  from anguished grief to solacing vision.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  On the homefront, Ezra Pound's bitter epitaph on soldiers slaughtered
  "for a botched civilization" in<i>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</i>  and
  Eliot's monumental allegory of postwar Europe as a waste land where
  parched spirits strain toward "dry thunder without rain" memorialize
  a blasted civilization in which no consolation survives beyond the
  art of the poem.

<p>
The "tinselly" Clarissa, who has lost no one very close to her in the
war, seems an unlikely candidate for renovating the elegy, yet her three
major portrayals--<i>The Voyage</i> Out, "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street,"
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>--link her intimately with the genre (<i>D,</i>
3:32, 18 June 1925).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The Clarissa of <i>The Voyage Out</i> tells Rachel Vinrace that as
  a girl she "sobb[ed] over" Shelley's "Adonais":

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"He has outsoared the shadow of our night,
<br />
Envy and calumny and hate and pain--
<br />
. . .
<br />
Can touch him not and torture not again
<br />
From the contagion of the world's slow stain,"
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
she recites. "How divine!--and yet, what nonsense! . . . I always think
it's living, not dying, that counts" (VO, 58). If every loss awakens
every earlier loss back to the first (oedipal) loss of the mother, the
glamorous Clarissa--a substitute for Rachel's dead mother--embodies the
elegy's very principle: the necessity of relinquishing the dead and of
forming new attachments in order to carry on with life.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Rachel's early death dramatizes this lesson's failure, but Clarissa's
  deft critique reclaims the earthly solaces that "Adonais" sacrifices
  in its uncannily prophetic, near-suicidal closing ecstasy to urge
  Rachel toward fresh woods and pastures new.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
In "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street," Clarissa steps into the glorious June
morning to Big Ben's "solemn," "stirring" strokes and reflects that her
fellow Londoners are "not all bound on errands of happiness. . . . How
people suffered" ("BS," 152). Again "Adonais" is her touchstone as she
thinks of one friend's son, killed in the war, and another's death:
"And now can never mourn--how did it go?--a head grown grey . . . From
the contagion of the world's slow stain . . . have drunk their cup
a round or two before" ("BS," 154; ellipses in original). But now she
herself ts despair as she quests for perfect gloves through London's
glittering "contagion." She almost weeps to see, upright and immobile
in her carriage, her idol, ancient Lady Bexborough, said to be "sick of
it all"; later she quells an impulse to send the shopgirl, who looks
"tired" and "twenty years older," on holiday: "Selling gloves was her
job. She had her own sorrows quite separate, 'and now can never mourn,
can never mourn,' the words ran in her head. 'From the contagion of the
world's slow stain,' . . . for there are moments when it seems utterly
futile" ("BS," 156-8). The floating predicate "and now can never mourn"
dissolves the shopgirl's "separate" sorrows in the submerged pool of
common, unconsoled grief beneath Clarissa's thoughts:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Lady Bexborough, who opened the bazaar, they say, with the telegram in
her hand--Roden, her favourite, killed--she would go on. But why, if
one doesn't believe? For the sake of others, she thought. . . . For one
doesn't live for oneself. . . . Fear no more she repeated. There were
little brown spots on her arm. And the girl crawled like a snail. Thou
thy worldly task hast done. Thousands of young men had died that things
might go on. At last! Half an inch above the elbow; pearl buttons;
five and a quarter. ["BS," 158-9]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Asking why go on, how go on, and for what--what sort of going on is
possible after so many senseless deaths--Clarissa, even while enjoying
the worldly luxuries of her class, expresses a communal grief and
desolation and a longing for solace assuaged by neither Shakespeare's
"Home art gone" (bespeaking an earlier age of the world's experience)
nor Shelley's "divine . . . nonsense."

<b></b>

<p>
As the 1923 Clarissa marks the elegiac place vacated by "the moderns,"
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s early title, <i>The Hours,</i> announces its
aspiration to public elegy (A New Elegy by Virginia Woolf) by echoing
Shelley's apostrophe to the "sad Hour" of Keats's death:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rouse thy obscure compeers
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And teach them thine own sorrow, say: with me
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Died Adonais; till the Future dares
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be
<br />
An echo and a light unto eternity!
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Materializing these compeer hours in Big Ben's mundane strokes, Woolf
adapts Shelley's re to prose fiction's modernist-realist world through
the novel's technical innovation: her "discovery" of how to light up her
characters' psyches from within by arraying their interior monologues as
a system of "beautiful" psychic "caves," linked by passageways of common
memories and experiences, in which each character's past meets "daylight
at the present moment" (<i>D,</i> 2:263, 30 August 1923). Translating
Shelley's personified hours schooled by the Hour of loss into her
characters' memory-haunted present, Woolf jettisons plot for the elegy's
inward work of mourning and voices communal loss as a polyphony of
private griefs: a tapestry of thought and feeling that interweaves all
the characters' separate sorrows. Septimus's sublime hallucination of
Evans, Rezia's poignant memories of Italy, Doris Kilman's consuming rage,
Peter's anguish at losing Clarissa, Clarissa's grief for Sylvia: all
summon Hours of loss that present and future cannot, or dare not, forget.

<p>
The 1925 Clarissa is first among equals in the compound elegiac subject
formed by these "beautiful caves," privileged especially as the mourner
of Septimus's death; but through this technique she now represents
"all deaths &amp; sorrows" in a way not limited by her limitations.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s genesis in the death of Clarissa's
 original--a friend of Virginia's youth, Kitty Lushington Maxse
 (1867-1922)--dramatizes the referential diffusion and psychic mobility
 by which the elegy makes the death that occasions it encompass "all
 deaths &amp; sorrows," including the elegist's own.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  After Julia Stephen died in 1895, the glamorous and vivacious Kitty
  had exerted herself to conduct her friend's two young daughters into
  "good" society and marriages until, after their father's death in 1904,
  Vanessa and Virginia escaped to Bloomsbury to invent their modern
  lives and arts. Kitty was particularly severe on Virginia Stephen's
  artistic ambitions: she "scream[ed] against Bloomsbury," dismissed
  her writings, condemned her friends ("oh darling, how awful they do
  look!"), disliked her memoir of her father, and moaned, "Virginia
  might marry an <i>author</i> and they always talk about themselves!"
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  Safe beyond Kitty's Kensington, Virginia recalled having felt herself
  "a kind of slug" in that "unreal Paradise," with Kitty "like salt"
  on that "very sensitive snail" (<i>L,</i> 1:209, 1 October 1905). But
  Kitty still animated her memory and imagination. The 1915 Clarissa "is
  almost Kitty verbatim; what would happen if she guessed?" (<i>L,</i>
  1:349, 10 August 1908); and when Woolf read of Kitty's death in
  October 1922, she was at work on the short story sequence begun with
  "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
The news brought a flood of ambivalent memories of her old antagonist:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the day has been spoilt for me--so strangely. . . . I hadn't seen her
since, I guess, 1908--save at old Davies' funeral [in 1916], &amp; then
I cut her, which now troubles me--unreasonably I suppose. I could not
have kept up with her; she never tried to see me. Yet yet--these old
friends dying without any notice on our part always . . . saddens me:
makes me feel guilty. I wish I'd met her in the street. My mind has
gone back all day to her. . . . She got engaged at St Ives. . . . I keep
going over this very day in my mind. [D, 2:206, 8 October 1922]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Six days later the stories "branched into a novel" as, instead of
attending the memorial service, Woolf remembered Kitty from afar:
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
now Kitty is buried &amp; mourned by half the grandees in London;
&amp; here I am thinking of my book. Kitty fell, very mysteriously,
over some bannisters. Shall I ever walk again? she said to Leo. And to
the Dr "I shall never forgive myself for my carelessness." How did it
happen? Someone presumably knows, &amp; in time I shall hear. [<i>D,</i>
2:207, 14 October 1922]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Two days later she set down the idea for <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>: "Sanity
&amp; insanity. Mrs D. seeing the truth. S. S. seeing the insane
truth. . . . The pace is to be given by the gradual increase of S's
insanity. on the one side; by the approach of the party on the other"
(<i>H,</i> 412).

<p>
Woolf's curiosity about Kitty's "mysterious" fall persisted: "there's
Kitty Maxse falling . . . and killing herself"; "I've heard nothing
about Kitty, and couldn't face the memorial service--my black being
incomplete. How on earth did it happen?" (<i>L,</i> 2:573, 574, 22 and
29 October 1922). Her later recollection that Clarissa "was originally
to kill herself, or perhaps merely to die at the end of the party" while
"Septimus, who later is intended to be her double, had no existence"
may refer to this doubt, since nothing in <i>The Hours</i> suggests that
Clarissa was to die or kill herself, and she had invented "S. S." almost
immediately.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
  About 9 November 1922, Woolf devised the double design that displaces
  Clarissa's death onto Septimus: "All must bear finally upon the
  party at the end; which expresses life, in every variety &amp;
  full of conviction: while S. dies" (<i>H,</i> 415). If Woolf ever
  settled whether Kitty threw herself downstairs or "merely" died,
  she did not record it; but in keeping with Sacks's point that the
  death the elegy mourns is always the elegist's own, her fantasy casts
  Kitty--hence Clarissa and Septimus--as her doubles. Kitty stands
  to Woolf (who had twice tried to kill herself) in much the same
  specular and sacrificial relation as Septimus stands to Clarissa;
  "S." substitutes for Kitty, Clarissa, and not least, Woolf--the
  seventh/septimus of eight Duckworth/Stephen children.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
Once Kitty died Clarissa could not go on "living" in quite the same
way, despite her fictional status and the displacement of her death
onto Septimus. Kitty's death shadows the fictional counterpart who
survives her:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely; all this must
go on without her . . . or did it not become consoling to believe that
death ended absolutely? but that somehow

<b></b>

in the streets of London, on the ebb and flow of things, here, there,
<i>she survived, Peter</i> survived, lived in each other, she being part
. . . of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist between
the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had
seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life,
herself. [<i>MD,</i> 9; emphasis mine]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As her fear that <i>she must cease</i> swerves from the normative future
conditional (<i>somehow she would survive</i>) to the declarative past
(<i>somehow . . . she survived</i>), it is as though Clarissa (like Kitty)
were already dead, or as though Kitty were speaking through her; as though
Kitty's actual death were converging grammatically with her afterlife in
the 1925 Clarissa; or as though death were scarcely to be distinguished
from life's moment-by-moment vanishing into the past. Or, since <i>somehow
. . . Peter survived</i> too, as though any ontological distinction
between life and death were obscured by the ontological resemblances
between absence and death, and between life and its afterlife in memory,
imagination, art. Clarissa and Peter have, after all, borne each other
like mist on their branches through their long mutual absence, just as
one would carry the other if one of them should die, and just as Woolf
carried Kitty in life and after death, in memory and art, in stories that
"branched" upon her death into this elegiac novel. In bringing Kitty back
to "life" on a radiant June day that <i>in fact she never lived</i>, Woolf
flaunts the elegist's power, invisibly flourishing Clarissa herself in
Escherlike proof of Clarissa's own vision of life-after-death. Through
her art Kitty symbolically survives, spreads ever so far, her life,
herself, borne on in time by those who knew her (including Woolf, who
had not seen her for years, and whose art Kitty scorned) and by people
she never met, including the novel's ever-widening circles of readers.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
But the "beautiful caves" poetics that the 1925 Clarissa bodies forth
transcends sentimental memorial. At once portrait and <i>persona</i>
(originally a facial image of the dead as well as a mask through which one
speaks [<i>EE,</i> 126]), she is no longer Kitty verbatim, an object drawn
by Woolf-as-writing-subject, but an image of the deeper, more complex
ways people survive--<i>or not</i>--in and through one another. For Woolf
can raise her old antagonist Kitty from the dead only by breathing her
own life into her. Books, she observes in her 1928 Introduction, are
"flowers or fruit stuck here and there on a tree which has its roots
deep down in the earth of our earliest life," so that "the truth" behind
fiction's "immense facades"--"if life is indeed true, and if fiction is
indeed fictitious"--would require "a volume or two of autobiography"
("I," 197). But is life "true" and fiction "fictitious"? Is Kitty the
inaccessible real behind Clarissa's marmoreal "facade"? Or does the
novel's modernist poetics, continuous with its symbolic consolations,
debunk the distinction between subject and object such propositions
assume? How exactly does Kitty survive transred in art, her counsel
"it's <i>living</i>, not dying, that counts" revived from beyond the
grave?

<p>
At stake in these questions is, first, a composite modernist
self/other-portraiture that weaves biography and autobiography, "Kitty
verbatim" and "invented" memories, observed surface and imagined depths,
into fiction's "truth," Clarissa. An interfused Kitty/Woolf, dead yet
living, absent yet present, a psyche unbounded by even a fictional
body, Clarissa is a symbolic subject/object entity that captures as in
a hologram the way the historical Woolf lifted the historical Kitty on
the branches of her life and

<b></b>

art.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  But its postwar context gives this modernist portraiture deeper
  resonance. In 1918 Woolf saw her brother Adrian talking with a German
  prisoner of war and reflected, "The reason why it is easy to kill
  another person must be that one's imagination is too sluggish to
  conceive what his life means to him--the infinite possibilities of
  a succession of days which are furled in him, &amp; have already
  been spent" (<i>D,</i> 1:186, 27 August 1918). In this light, her
  resurrection of Kitty--whom in her mother's stead she had, in a sense,
  fought for her life--as a Clarissa who somehow survives, blooming on
  the tree of her author's "earliest life," her infinite possibilities
  unfurling through the book of her day, marks not just a technical
  breakthrough but an elegiac act of imagination that intrinsically
  opposes violence.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  Against the still unvanquished violence of its postwar moment--everyday
  death, everyday life, as well as the murderous ethos of war--this
  modernist narrative poses a counterforce ontological, aesthetic,
  and ethical, writ small in Clarissa's thoughts on the death of a
  young man she has never met, writ large in the narrative's luminous
  divinations of its characters' unfurling lives.

<p>
If Kitty's symbolic resurrection, dramatizing a daughter-artist's
victory over Conversion-worshipping mothers, evokes the oedipal
dimension of mourning, Clarissa's dead sister Sylvia res not the
contingent opposition of a Julia, a Kitty, or a German POW but the
absolute antagonist Death. This feminine vegetation deity, naturalized
and mythified in Clarissa's re of consolation, at once modernizes
the pastoral elegy and opposes to the objectifying metaphysics of a
warmaking society that is "a father" an ontology that locates "reality"
in "Odd affinities"--not in discrete "subject and object" (<i>MD,</i>
153; <i>TL,</i> 38). Feminine in origin and history but not essence,
this metaphysics frames the novel's intersubjective character-drawing
as a consolation for "poor devils, of both sexes."

<p>
Dropping the 1923 allusions to "Adonais," <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s opening
pages follow Clarissa's thoughts from Sylvia (from Latin <i>silvanus</i>,
forest) to the re of survival as mist-bearing branches. The phrase
<i>somehow she survived</i> thus condenses Clarissa withSylvia, to
whose death Peter Walsh traces Clarissa's "atheist's religion"--an
aberration from the nationalist religion proper to her "public-spirited,
British Empire, tariff-reform, governing-class spirit." Possibly,
Peter speculates,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she said to herself, As we are a doomed race, chained to a sinking ship
. . ., as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate, do our part;
mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners

<b></b>

. . . ; be as decent as we possibly can. Those ruffians, the Gods,
shan't have it all their own way,--her notion being that the Gods, who
never lost a chance of hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives were
seriously put out if, all the same, you behaved like a lady. That phase
came directly after Sylvia's death--that horrible affair. To see your
own sister killed by a falling tree (all Justin Parry's fault--all his
carelessness) before your very eyes, a girl too on the verge of life,
the most gifted of them, Clarissa always said, was enough to turn one
bitter. Later she wasn't so positive perhaps; she thought there were no
Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion
of doing good for the sake of goodness. [<i>MD,</i> 77-8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
If Peter is right, Clarissa took no solace in providential father-gods
or promises of heaven but blamed malevolent "ruffians" and her inept
father (if the parenthetical condemnation is hers too), later casting off
this childlike fantasy for fatalism and a stoic ethics of decency. As
her disillusion with father-res originates with Sylvia's death, so
do the consolations of her "atheist's religion," whose imagery seems
to have influenced Peter's earlier reverie in Regent's Park. There,
longing "for solace, for relief, for something outside these miserable
. . . craven men and women," he too imagines a sylvan feminine apotheosis:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
if he can conceive of her, then in some sort she exists, he thinks, and
advancing down the path with his eyes upon sky and branches he rapidly
endows them with womanhood; sees with amazement how . . . majestically
. . . they dispense with a dark flutter of leaves charity, comprehension,
absolution, and then, flinging themselves suddenly aloft, confound the
piety of their aspect with a wild carouse. [<i>MD,</i> 57]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Symbolically reborn in Clarissa's and Peter's metaphysical trees of
life and death, the Adonislike Sylvia counters sacrificing fathers and
father-gods with a "re of the mother whose sons have been killed in
the battles of the world"--everyday conflicts and the Great War alike
(<i>MD,</i> 58).

<p>
Sylvia, of whom we learn almost nothing, is less a character than Death
itself. She is the specter of Clarissa's, the harbinger of Septimus's,
the ghost of Kitty's, and also, in this book that flowers on the tree
of its author's earliest life, of Julia's and Leslie Stephen's, and (as
shocking as Sylvia's) of Stella Duckworth's at twenty-eight and Thoby
Stephen's at twenty-six. As the vegetation god of this public elegy,
she is also the deaths of the millions destroyed by the war and the
prospective deaths that shadow the survivors. Sylvia--all dead sisters,
brothers, fathers, mothers, friends, soldiers known and unknown, lost
companions of war and peace--is death as the "life" or "truth" behind
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s fictional "facade," the mystery of mortality: death
as reality, necessity, <i>Ananke,</i> intrinsic to life and nature, to
thrushes breaking snails on stones and to the falling tree that fells her.

<p>
As death transred, Sylvia is also art. As Clarissa transmutes
her death and proper name into mist-bearing branches, Sylvia res
consolation's necessarily purely symbolic nature without losing her
meaning of natural death. Her name condenses the work of mourning, at
once memorializing her and dissolving her into nature's generic matrix:
<i>silvanus</i> to Sylvia to ral mist-laden branches; dust to Dust
to an urn filled

<b></b>

with ashes. Her literary name also resonates with Woolf's memory of
how Julia Stephen's death "quicken[ed]" in her thirteen-year-old self
"unveiled and intensified . . . perceptions, as if a burning glass had
been laid over what was shaded and dormant . . . as if something were
becoming visible," so that, desultorily perusing Palgrave's <i>Golden
Treasury</i> in Kensington Gardens, she was startled to find a poem



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
instantly and for the first time . . . intelligible. . . . [N]o one could
have understood from what I said the queer feeling I had in the hot grass,
that poetry was coming true. . . . It matches what I have sometimes felt
when I write. The pen gets on the scent.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sylvia is death as the alpha and omega of poetry, art, writing; the
<i>sign</i> of Julia's, Kitty's, and all past and future deaths that
coalesced to transform stories of shopping, prime ministers, and "Cut
flowers" into this modern pastoral elegy.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
It is no accident that Sylvia's memory sparks a reverie that takes
Clarissa to Hatchard's bookshop window, where, on seeing Shakespeare's
"Fear no more" from <i>Cymbeline,</i> she wonders, "What was she trying
to recover? What image of white dawn in the country" (<i>MD,</i> 9). The
posthumous Kitty/Clarissa evokes the Posthumus (so named because he
survived his mother's death at his birth) of <i>Cymbeline</i>--the play
that inducted the nineteen-year-old scoffer Virginia into the bard's
"company of worshippers." What she thought the "best lines" in this or
perhaps any play, "Imogen says--Think that you are upon a rock, and now
throw me again! and Posthumous answers--Hang there like fruit, my Soul,
till the tree die," find echo in Clarissa's mist-laden branches and
Woolf's tree of life hung with flowers/fruit/books (<i>L,</i> 1:45-6,
5 November 1901). Envisioning himself as a tree embraced by his soul
Imogen--or perhaps faithful Imogen as a tree on which his soul hangs "like
fruit" till death--Posthumus rejoices in her awakening from what turns out
to be only a sleep, and in his own release from suicidal despair at the
mistaken thought that he has destroyed her, his "only jewel." Imogen's
"Why did you throw your wedded lady from you? / Think that you are upon
a rock, and now / Throw me again" gently mocks his fort/da game. He has
foolishly tested and accidentally "killed" her, discovered his error
and wished to die, only to find her miraculously restored: will he
throw her again? Literalizing loss restored as only the romance can,
<i>Cymbeline</i> reunites Posthumus and Imogen as living "tree" and
"fruit" in deferral ("till the tree die"), if not defiance, of death.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
The modernist-realist character Clarissa cannot literally "recover" what
she has lost, but her longing for some lost "white dawn in the country"
summons pastoral memories of Bourton that recur throughout the day. The
most striking, Sally Seton's kiss--"the most exquisite moment of her
whole life"--she compares to "a present, wrapped up," hers to keep
but not to look at; an indestructible "diamond, something infinitely
precious," a "revelation" imbued with "radiance" and "religious feeling"
(<i>MD,</i> 35-6). Only through memory does Clarissa "recover" her lost
love, burnished with such metaphoric richness as young Virginia embraced
in <i>Cymbeline.</i> This "present," a gift too precious to unwrap or
look at--a moment once present now past, yet preserved in memory and
symbolically "present" again--bespeaks memory's power to conjure lost

<b></b>

"jewels," make them "present" in dazzling splendor. <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i>
that is, literalizes Posthumus's consolation for its later age of the
world's experience by rescuing love-lost-and-recovered from the romance's
unreal paradise and relocating it in the symbolic realms of memory,
imagination, and art--where it defeats time and loss more securely than
the romance of presence Posthumus's very name belies, even as it enacts
the mourner's necessary submission to the reality of loss.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
The young Virginia's query as to why <i>Cymbeline</i>'s characters "aren't
. . . more human?" foreshadows the mature Woolf's translation of Imogen's
survival to Clarissa's realist world (<i>L,</i> 1:45). Peter recalls how,
riding atop an omnibus, young Clarissa consoled herself for "how little
one knew people" and allayed her "horror of death" by theorizing that
human lives are not bounded in time and space but indefinitely dispersed
through a space/time continuum that extends beyond the organism's apparent
life and death:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she felt herself everywhere; not "here, here, here"; and she tapped the
back of the seat; but everywhere. . . . She was all that. So that to
know her, or any one, one must seek out the people who completed them;
even the places. Odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken
to, some woman in the street, some man behind a counter--even trees,
or barns. It ended in a transcendental theory which, with her horror
of death, allowed her to believe, or say that she believed (for all her
scepticism), that since our apparitions, the part of us which appears,
are so momentary compared with . . . the unseen part of us, which
spreads wide, the unseen might survive, be recovered somehow attached
to this person or that, or even haunting certain places after death
. . . perhaps--perhaps. [<i>MD,</i> 152-3; last ellipsis in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Clarissa's "transcendental theory" extends Posthumus's tree hung with
Soul/fruit into a vast arboreal metaphor that augments conscious and/or
bodily presence with unconscious experience, memory, and perception--of
and by others--such that one's "unseen part" "spreads wide" in space and
"might survive" in time, "be recovered somehow attached to this person
or that."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
The apposition of <i>survive</i> with the passive <i>be recovered</i>
finesses the question of <i>who</i> survives, <i>who</i> recovers,
as it answers Clarissa's longing for some "lost image of white dawn in
the country." How can this theory of being palliate a "horror of death"
when it renders Clarissa alive scarcely different from Clarisssa dead;
confounds life and death, self and other, presence and absence; values
memory and imagination over actualities, one's unconscious "unseen part"
over conscious "apparition"? Like Clarissa's branches and Peter's arboreal
goddess, the passage embeds the theory in its practice. Clarissa's unseen
part <i>already</i> spreads wide as she rides the omnibus with Peter;
<i>already</i> she is not (just) "here" where she seems to be, for as she
speaks her disavowed apparitional "here" detaches itself from accidents of
time and place to endure in Peter's memory, "haunting" him in her absence,
as now in the narrative present. Her assertion that she is not (only)
"here" survives to make her "present"--<i>here</i>--to Peter decades
later while, on this June day, her apparition busies itself elsewhere
with party preparations, thinking of her life's moments as "buds on the
tree of life, flowers of darkness"

<b></b>

(<i>MD,</i> 29). The Clarissa who was once (not) "here" on the bus with
Peter "survives" "attached" to his later self; is "recovered" in his
memory and by the narrative, a diamantine "present" preserved from time,
death, loss, absence.

<p>
Does it matter that it is Peter, not her apparition, for whom her unseen
part survives, or that her apparition must die as surely as Posthumus's
tree? Does it matter that their shared moments, once "buds on the tree
of life, flowers of darkness," are now memory's "fruits" on the tree
of life and <i>death</i>? And of art, for the narrative structure on
which Peter and Clarissa hang like souls or fruits is founded on this
theory of being that branches beyond one's apparition in all directions,
indeterminate and unseen. Not plot connects Clarissa and Septimus but such
odd affinities with "people she had never spoken to" as exist between,
say, Adrian--or Woolf--and the German POW. As theorized by Clarissa and
practiced in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s intersubjective character-drawing, odd
affinities lift elegiac consolation out of the register of the sentimental
to counter the "death of the soul": the atrophy of imaginative powers
presupposed, Woolf thought, in the murderousness that objectifies beings
who are inseparably subject and object (<i>MD,</i> 58).

<p>
What then of the odd affinity between two strangers and <i>semblables</i>
at the heart of the book: "Mrs D. seeing the truth. S. S. seeing
the insane truth" (<i>H,</i> 412)? What is its nature and how does it
console? One source of Clarissa's feeling "somehow very like" Septimus is
her own everyday battle against despair (<i>MD,</i> 186). Her ontology
does not permanently allay her "horror of death" but itself forms part
of a rich web of imagery, a very garment of consolation, that she spins
out moment by moment as her mind tosses up metaphors (and genius, says
Aristotle, is metaphor) that show what life is literally "like" for her.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  As Peter observes, she "enjoy[s] life immensely"; it is "her nature
  to enjoy," to be "all aquiver" and "such good company, spotting queer
  little scenes, names, people from the top of a bus"; she possesses
  an "indomitable vitality," "a thread of life which for toughness,
  endurance, power to overcome obstacles, and carry her triumphantly
  through he had never known the like of" (<i>MD,</i> 78, 152, 155). Yet
  her "gift . . . to be; to exist; to sum it all up in the moment as
  she passed" must ceaselessly contend against her dread of death,
  her feeling that it is "very, very dangerous to live even one day,"
  her everyday t to affirm that "it's <i>living</i>, not dying,
  that counts" (<i>MD,</i> 174, 8). This familiar "horror," highlighted
  in the draft, attacks Clarissa when she hears of Septimus's suicide
  and imagines his



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
dread, that horror, the terror; she felt it too; horror filling her
. . . the incapacity to withstand, the overwhelming hostility of the race
. . . its vast loneliness, its entire feebleness, . . . so that if Richard
had not been there, merely to read the Times aloud; so that listening one
could recoup . . . could hear him breathing in the room; could wait like
a crouched bird under a leaf; could gradually recover . . . her [belief?
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 ]; not in Gods &amp; power, but only in the breath, in the Times, in
 the fire; &amp; so fanning this little flame, could feel rise within
 once more the imperious thing. But he had not recovered.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Doubles and mirrors, exemplars of "Sanity &amp; insanity," these two
who meet at a party as though death were no unbridgeable divide see the
"truth" and alike t despair.

<b></b>

But whereas Clarissa fans her wavering flame back to life, Septimus
"had not recovered." Almost nothing separates the suicide displaced
onto Septimus from Kitty/Clarissa/Woolf (and perhaps Shelley, with his
divine nonsense) from the "divine vitality" Clarissa adores (<i>MD,</i>
7). In Clarissa, life triumphs; in Septimus, death; but in their redoubled
reflection, death-in-life mirrors life-in-death. She, like him, battles
despair; he, like her, basks--moments before he leaps--in sanity,
happiness, hope.

<p>
This is why death comes to Clarissa's party, of all the parties in
London: because she can admit it; because she lets it in. Clarissa, that
"thoroughgoing sceptic," recognizes the death that arrives uninvited, like
Sally Seton, as unmistakably as though Wilkins had intoned its name. Death
comes to her party because she (the perfect hostess) can entertain it,
a guest and a familiar. Its only seemingly fortuitous arrival clinches
the novel's "idea," "<i>the contrast between life &amp; death</i>," in
an odd affinity: resemblance and difference attenuated, infinitesimal,
yet absolute, momentous (<i>H,</i> 414). He is somehow very likeher,
borne on her branches with Sylvia and Peter, barns and trees, a <i>man
behind a counter</i> ("To look at, [Septimus] might have been a clerk"),
a <i>woman in the street</i> (<i>MD,</i> 84).

<p>
We shall return to Clarissa's impromptu elegy for Septimus and the
poetry contest it stages between her ontology of odd affinities and
the objectifying positivism of the doctors who would "forc[e his] soul,"
sacrifice him to their "Goddess[es]" Proportion and Conversion (<i>MD,</i>
184, 100). But first it will be helpful to consider a more vexed affinity
between Clarissa and that woman in the street Miss Kilman. Through their
contending metaphysics--Clarissa's "atheist's religion" and ruling-class
nationalism against Doris Kilman's turn to God and Russia--this postwar
elegy stages competing truths and values in a post-theological cosmos
in which communities and nations must grapple with their differences
and their aggression. Their conflict displays the nationalism and
class antagonism that, Keynes warned, threatened Europe's democratic
civilization as it preres Freud's postwar writings on the pressing
dangers of class oppression and religious "illusion" to Europe's future.

<p>
"[W]ith another throw of the dice," Clarissa "would have loved Miss
Kilman! But not in this world. No" (<i>MD,</i> 12). Here the "brutal
monster" of involuntary hatred lumbers in "that leaf-encumbered forest,
the soul," although she knows what she really hates is "the idea of her,
which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not
Miss Kilman; had become one of those spectres with which one battles in
the night; . . . who stand astride us and suck up half our life-blood,
dominators and tyrants" (ibid.). The feeling is mutual. Doris Kilman
thinks Clarissa not kind but "merely condescending," from "the most
worthless of all classes--the rich, with a smattering of culture," and
pictures her turned out of her sofa and installed "in a factory; behind
a counter; Mrs. Dalloway and all the other fine ladies!" She violently
envies her beauty, elegance, charm, domestic luxury, glamorous social
life, adoring husband, and lovely daughter: "If she could have felled
her it would have eased her. . . . If only she could make her weep; could
ruin her; humiliate her; bring her to her knees crying, You are right! But
this was God's will, not Miss Kilman's. It was to be a religious victory"
(<i>MD,</i> 123-5).

<p>
Clarissa's intuition that she hates not Miss Kilman but a "spectre"
comprised of "a great deal" else provokes us to inquire into that
abstraction of domination and tyranny and so to grasp their class
antagonism as a microcosmic cross section of the nationalist conflicts
in which Europe's future is indeed at stake. This poetry contest indicts
postwar nationalisms that, while pretending to battle external threats
to peace and security, actually <i>produce</i> enemies, dominators,
and war by an unacknowledged violence within. The dominator-tyrant that
Clarissa projects upon Doris Kilman, whose family (then Kiehlman) came
from Germany in the eighteenth century, evokes a defeated and still
belligerent postwar Germany, thrust like a pariah outside the Allies'
international community, while the decadent Clarissa whom Miss Kilman
would re-educate personifies an England tyrannical in victory and heedless
of the political consequences of the international class oppression
instituted at Versailles. In facing these women off, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>
explores the competition, envy, hatred, and aggression between classes
and nations that had already engulfed Europe in war and would slowly
rise to a boil again in the 1920s and 1930s.

<p>
Doris Kilman, indeed, bodies forth Keynes's warning that the economic
sanctions imposed by the Peace could only provoke another war. By the
time Woolf wrote <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> her old friend Maynard had gained
world fame by his critique of the Allies' war reparations policy as a
punitive, barbaric, and self-destructive holdover of nationalism.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  Participating as a British Treasury officer in the Paris Peace talks,
  he had resigned in protest in May 1919 and retreated that August to
  Vanessa Bell's country house (near Monks House, which the Woolfs had
  just taken) to write <i>The Economic</i>

<b></b>

<i>Consequences of the Peace,</i> published in December. Keynes had
urged the Allied leaders to embrace internationalist policies that would
promote Europe's welfare as a whole, not enrich some nations at others'
expense. Instead they instituted what he diagnosed as the "abhorrent
and detestable" policy of a backward-looking "old man" who sees only
the rivals France and Germany, not "European civilization struggling
forwards to a new order" nor "humanity . . . at the threshold of a
new age" (<i>ECP,</i> 225, 36). An instrument of nationalist rivalry,
the Versailles Treaty would, he predicted, "sow the decay of the
whole civilized life of Europe" by "reducing Germany to servitude
for a generation," "degrading the lives of millions of human beings,"
"depriving a whole nation of happiness" (<i>ECP,</i> 225).

<p>
Keynes, in short, prophesied not just the economic consequences of the
Peace--"actual starvation" of "the European populations"--but their
social, psychic, and political consequences: social unrest, revolution,
and ultimately another war (<i>ECP,</i> 228). Since Germany's starving
peoples would resist a foreign tax not compelled by "their sense of
justice or duty," the reparations would incite "vengeance," a "final
civil war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions
of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade
into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilization
and the progress of our generation" (<i>ECP,</i> 282, 268). Condemning
a Treaty that violated both "human nature" and "the spirit of the age"
and would foment political revolution as surely as Russia's "bloodthirsty
philosophers," Keynes urged that "expediency and generosity agree": "the
policy which will best promote immediate friendship between nations" would
also favor "the permanent interests of the benefactor"--peace, prosperity,
the security of Europe's democratic civilization (<i>ECP,</i> 282, 238).

<p>
"Had Keynes's 1919 programme been carried out," Robert Skidelsky writes,
"it is unlikely that Hitler would have become German Chancellor."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Ignored at Versailles, Keynes dedicated his book to "the new
  generation," which he sought to influence through "those forces
  of instruction and imagination which change <i>opinion</i>": the
  "assertion of truth, the unveiling of illusion, the dissipation of
  hate, the enlargement and instruction of men's hearts and minds"
  (<i>ECP,</i> 298, 296-7). In pacifist Bloomsbury, opinion was already
  with him. <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace,</i> Woolf mused,
  was "a book that influences the world without being in the least a work
  of art: a work of morality, I suppose" (<i>D,</i> 2:33, 24 April 1920).

<p>
Works of art too may hope to influence the world. Not for nothing
does Miss Kilman possess "a really historical mind" (<i>MD,</i>
11). Despite her commanding "knowledge of modern history"--"thorough
in the extreme"--Doris Kilman has lost her teaching post because of her
German ancestry.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  Deprived of her livelihood, she is a walking allegory of the
  aggressively aggrieved postwar Germany Keynes tried to forestall. She
  enters Clarissa's orbit through the kindness of Richard, who has
  found her "working for the Friends"--presumably, for peace--and,
  pained by her misfortune, has engaged her to tutor Elizabeth.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  Miss Kilman reflects on how wartime nationalist paranoia has blighted
  her life:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she had never been able to tell lies. Miss Dolby thought she would be
happier with people who shared her views about the Germans. She had had
to go. It was true that the family was of German origin; spelt the name
Kiehlman in the eighteenth century; but her brother had been killed. They
turned her out because she would not pretend that the Germans were all
villains--when she had German friends, when the only happy days of her
life had been spent in Germany! [<i>MD,</i> 123-4]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
An Englishwoman whose brother has, it appears, fought and died
for England, Doris Kilman nonetheless finds herself a racialized
outcast. Unjustly deprived of her livelihood, she feels "cheated" of
her "right to some kind of happiness"--the one kind she can hope for,
"what with being so clumsy and so poor" (<i>MD,</i> 123). Too homely
to find happiness in "the opposite sex" (men being in short supply in
any case after the war) and too poor to buy "pretty clothes" (anyway,
"No clothes suited" her "unlovable body"), she does not hope to "come
first with anyone."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  Still, she might have had the modest happiness of her teaching
  post--a vital social world, a secure if small income, the intellectual
  satisfactions and social place for which her degree and "more than
  respectable" expertise in "modern history" qualify her--had not her
  fellow English, anticipating both Versailles and Hitler's racialized
  violence, impoverished and degraded her in her own country (<i>MD,</i>
  132). The spelunking narrator, in short, traces her near-murderous
  envy of Clarissa not to an essentially tyrannical personality
  but to a natural resentment of social injuries. Her psychic "cave"
  illuminates her rage and self-righteousness not as isolated character
  faults but as a case study of the dynamics of nationalism and class
  in collective aggression--a fictional animation of Keynes's prophecy
  that an impoverished Germany would avenge itself on the Allies.

<p>
Miss Kilman's history anticipates the theory of human aggression that
Freud read out of "the horrors of the recent World War":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The . . . truth . . . which people are so ready to disavow, is that
men are not gentle creatures who want to be loved, and who at the most
can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary,
creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful
share of aggressiveness. . . . [T]heir neighbour is . . . someone who
tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his
capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his
consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain,
to torture and to kill him. . . . Who, in the face of all his experience
of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Aggression and the death-instinct, Freud argued, are not pathological
aberrations but inherent in human nature and ineradicable. Civilization
demands that individuals renounce instinctual aggression (murder,
cannibalism, incest) as well as submit to moral strictures against
lust, avarice, lies, fraud, calumny and so on; hence "every individual
isvirtually an enemy of civilization."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  Although civilization disarms this hostility with variousforms
  of recompense, its economy of aggression renounced in exchange for
  benefitsis inherently unstable, easily disturbed by social and economic
  inequities that exacerbate this fundamental discontent.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  Like Keynes, Freud saw class oppression as a formidable threat
  to Europe's democratic civilization, which could pacify its
  citizen-enemies only by reasonably equitable sociomaterial rewards.

<b></b>

<p>
One especially effective form of recompense, Freud notes, is
identification with the "cultural ideal," which consoles both oppressed
and privileged classes, "since the right to despise the people outside
it compensates them for the wrongs they suffer within": "No doubt one
is a wretched plebeian, harassed by debts and military service; but,
to make up for it, one is a Roman citizen, one has one's share in the
task of ruling other nations and dictating their laws" (<i>FI,</i>
17). So it is for the Londoners ("poor people all of them") who wait
swelled with pride by Buckingham Palace for "the Proime Minister's kyar"
while dreaming of "the heavenly life divinely bestowed upon Kings" no
less than for the already "upright" Clarissa, who "stiffen[s]" further
at any manifestation of Empire and sees "character," "something inborn
in the race; what Indians respected," in the Palace's "four-square"
architecture (<i>MD,</i> 12-9, "BS," 153). So it is for the imperial
Lady Bexborough, who "opened a bazaar" with the telegram informing her
of her youngest son's death in her hand, and for Mr. Bowley, in whose
"British breast" the breeze ruffles "some flag flying" (<i>MD,</i> 5,
20). And so it ought to be but is not for Doris Kilman. When she loses
her livelihood because she cannot pretend that all Germans are villains,
England's cultural ideal ceases to be hers, as it has ceased to be
international. Her aggression, which the civilization that subjects
her is supposed to reward her for renouncing, then erupts in a "violent
grudge against the world" (<i>MD,</i> 129).

<p>
What prevents Miss Kilman (an "outlaw" and "brigand" in the draft) from
acting on her urge to "fell" Clarissa, if not that she is civilized, that
she has a conscience (<i>H,</i> 202)? In Freud's analysis, self-policing
"conscience," not external police, is civilization's most powerful weapon
against aggressive instincts, which civilization can frustrate but never
destroy (<i>CD,</i> 70). The repository of civilization's prohibitions,
conscience absorbs forbidden aggression and redirects it against the self,
producing unconscious guilt.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
  By this means civilization transforms its enemies into agents: it
  restrains each individual's "aggression by weakening and disarming
  it and by setting up an agency within him to watch over it, like
  a garrison in a conquered city"--though at the cost of "a loss of
  happiness" (<i>CD,</i> 71, 81). While Miss Kilman takes pride in her
  virtue, "out of her meagre income set[ting] aside so much for causes
  she believed in," her civilized state--her conscience--has obviously
  not been bought and paid for by her society (<i>MD,</i> 125). Even the
  London poor, the vagrant woman who grins at Richard, the servants to
  whom Clarissa sends "love" at her parties, let alone the ruling-class
  Bexboroughs, Dalloways, and Prime Minister, are better compensated
  than she (<i>MD,</i> 165). Yet conscience forbids her to "ease" her
  "hot and painful" rage and redirects her aggression against herself
  (<i>MD,</i> 124). In precise proportion to the fact that she <i>is</i>
  civilized, she is wracked by suppressed and thwarted appetites, envy,
  self-pity, self-reproach.

<p>
For consolation and hope, the aggrieved Miss Kilman turns to "Russia,"
which helps her to manage homicidal rage without veering into suicidal
despair by converting violent envy into ideological aggression against
Clarissa and her kind. "With all this luxury," she thinks, looking at
Clarissa's Reynolds engraving while imagining a communized Mrs. Dalloway
laboring in a shop or factory, "what hope was there for a better state
of things?"; "She could not help being ugly; . . . Clarissa Dalloway
had laughed--but she

<b></b>

would . . . think of Russia; until she reached the pillar-box"
(<i>MD,</i> 124, 128-9). "Russia"--an alternative civilization, a more
just cultural ideal--sanctions her contempt for such emblems of the
old order as Clarissa. Her career "absolutely ruined" by the England
for which her brother died, Miss Kilman stands like a powder keg near
Russia's still-smoldering revolution (<i>MD,</i> 130). Her socialist
fantasies illustrate Keynes's warning that to bring "economic ruin"
upon "great countries" by "political tyranny and injustice" is to foment
revolution--thus far forestalled in Central Europe only by its failure to
offer any "prospect of improvement whatever" (indeed, for all her misery,
Miss Kilman is still in London).
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
When "Russia" fails, Miss Kilman "th[inks] of God," parodying Marx's
attack on religion as palliating the masses' suffering without curing
its social causes (<i>MD,</i> 124). Her religious practice amounts to a
strenuous effort to fortify her conscience against her violent outrage,
for "two years three months" after "Our Lord had come to her," her
"Bitter and burning" anger remains unappeased. Thoughts of God bring
not peace or mystical ecstasy but a holy warrior's righteousness: "Rage
was succeeded by calm. A sweet savour filled her veins, her lips parted,
and, standing formidable upon the landing in her mackintosh, she looked
with steady and sinister serenity at Mrs. Dalloway," savoring imminent
"religious victory" (<i>MD,</i> 124-5). Although her vow to "t;
vanquish; have faith in God" restrains her violence, neither Russia
nor religion soothes her "hot and turbulent feelings" or the worldly
desires she is too poor, homely, and oppressed to satisfy ("It was the
flesh that she must control") (<i>MD,</i> 124-9).

<p>
Abandoned by Elizabeth and assailed by "shocks of suffering," Miss
Kilman remains suspended between those strange bedfellows God and Russia
as she makes her lonely way through "all the commodities of the world"
out of the Army Navy Stores and into "that other sanctuary, the Abbey,"
where she kneels in dogged prayer among "reverent, middle class, English
men and women, some of them desirous of seeing the wax works" (<i>MD,</i>
133). The narrative pointedly declines to dissociate God and the soul from
commodities, nationalism, and class. Whereas better-fed Londoners find
"God . . . accessible and the path to Him smooth," Miss Kilman, hiding
her face in twitching hands, "struggle[s]" "to aspire above the vanities,
the desires, the commodities, to rid herself both of hatred and of love,
. . . so rough the approach to her God--so tough her desires" (<i>MD,</i>
133-4). So laboring, she "impresse[s]" the well-fixed Londoners with
"her largeness, robustness, and power"--Mr. Fletcher, Mrs. Dalloway,
"the Rev. Edward Whittaker, and Elizabeth too" (ibid.). Religious
warrior, communist sympathizer, unwitting prophet of a humiliated and
downtrodden Germany's working-class hero, Miss Kilman in her starved
longing "for a better state of things" is a casualty of the nationalist
hatreds against which Keynes inveighed. She stands as a small, ominous
emblem of the economic ruin of great countries and a portent of revenge
tragedy, counterposed to the effaced German elegy--an "ancient song" of
"love which prevails"--sung by another "battered woman" in the street
at the Regent's Park Tube station.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

<p>
More striking, finally, than the differences between Clarissa's
ineffectual noblesse oblige and Miss Kilman's odious righteousness are
their odd affinities. "Miss Kilman

<b></b>

would do anything for the Russians, starved herself for the Austrians,"
thinks Clarissa, in whom luxury has bred a lighter, freer, if not more
honest or noble conscience;



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her
superiority, your inferiority; how poor she was; how rich you were;
how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever
it might be, all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it,
her dismissal from school during the War--poor embittered unfortunate
creature! [<i>MD,</i> 12]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the aptly named Miss Kilman, who must be very, very good in order
not to be positively criminal, the pampered Clarissa has no need of a
heavy-duty conscience. She takes her privilege for granted, confuses
Armenians with Albanians, tosses threadbare cushions to her servants
"in gratitude . . . for helping her to be like this, . . . gentle,
generous-hearted," and rides the coattails of Richard's social conscience
from the haven of her sofa.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  Claiming "to wish everybody merely to be themselves," she yet
  finds the idea of praying shut up in a room "nauseating," and she is
  "really shocked" by the glowering Miss Kilman: "This a Christian--this
  woman! This woman had taken her daughter from her! She in touch with
  invisible presences! Heavy, ugly, commonplace, without kindness or
  grace, she know the meaning of life!" (<i>MD,</i> 125-6, 117). Yet
  hardly does she project on her "the power and taciturnity of some
  prehistoric monster armoured for primeval warfare" than "hatred (which
  was for ideas, not people) crumble[s]" and Clarissa laughs in relief
  to see her "los[e] her malignity" and become "merely Miss Kilman,
  in a mackintosh, whom Heaven knows Clarissa would have liked to help"
  (<i>MD,</i> 126).

<p>
For her part, Miss Kilman's conscience is weighty in proportion to the
mass of rage ithas had to absorb and find some nominally civilized alibi
for. In truth she would far rather resemble than despise Clarissa, and
if she did, she would not need the righteousness that weighs her down:
"she minded looking as she did beside Clarissa. . . . But why wish to
resemble her? . . . She despised Mrs. Dalloway . . . Her life was a
tissue of vanity and deceit. Yet Doris Kilman had . . . very nearly
burst into tears when Clarissa Dalloway laughed at her" (<i>MD,</i>
128). As the ur-Clarissa reflects, "All men were brothers. For that
very reason, one must hate some of them, as one hated part of oneself"
(<i>H,</i> 271). As Clarissa glimpses her role in creating the monster
she mistakes for Miss Kilman, Miss Kilman admits her secret wish to be
like this woman she pretends has no virtues. No one wins this contest,
but it shows that insofar as Miss Kilman is a monster, she is one created
by the social system--a casualty of an economic war between the wars,
a mute witness to Britain's unacknowledged tyranny.

<p>
Is Septimus Warren Smith mad or does he have a message? That he is mad
would seem indisputable; even sympathetic discussions cast him as a war
victim, not a prophet.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  Yet <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s postwar world of multifarious and contested
  realities pits Septimus's reality against that of his doctors to
  frame "madness" as censored truth. If, as Michel Foucault argues,
  civilization disciplines madness to suppress its truths, art recaptures
  truths branded madness to confront the world with the necessity of
  change: "by the madness which interrupts it, a work of art opens a
  void, a moment of silence, . . . where the world is forced to question
  itself. . . . [T]he world finds itself arraigned by that work of art
  and responsible before it for what it is."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

<p>
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s opening scenes frame this contestation of a
multiplicitous reality as an outworn monotheism confronts an immanent
modernist cosmos. Clarissa's cutting-edge metaphor "another throw of the
dice" is way ahead of Einstein's mistaken objection, "God does not play
dice," in the 1926 controversy over Heisenberg's quantum theory.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  In <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s cosmos God does not play dice, for God does
  not exist. Fate plays dice. As the infinite possibilities that ride the
  crest of time collapse moment by moment into events, fate is arbitrary,
  time irreversible, disaster, suffering, and death inevitable if also
  unpredictable, and promises of heaven obsolete. Old transcendences
  metamorphose into an airplane swooping "like a skater . . . or a
  dancer" to leave an advertising slogan in a melting trail of smoke.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
  No two groundlings whose caves meet "daylight" at this moment
  read this celestial sign in quite the same way. "'Glaxo,' said
  Mrs. Coates in a strained, awe-stricken voice"; "'Kreemo', murmured
  Mrs. Bletchley, like a sleep-walker"; "It's toffee," murmured
  Mr. Bowley; "So, thought Septimus, . . . they are signalling to me";
  "Hadn't Mrs. Dempster always longed to see foreign parts?"; "a bright
  spark; an aspiration; a concentration; a symbol (so it seemed to
  Mr. Bentley, vigorously rolling his strip of turf at Greenwich) of
  man's soul; of his determination . . . to get outside his body, beyond
  his house, by means of thought, Einstein, speculation, mathematics,
  the Mendelian theory" (<i>MD,</i> 20-8). Meanwhile, the earthbound
  counterpart of this heavenly sign, the inscrutable state motorcar
  ("probably the Queen, thought Mrs. Dalloway"), stops traffic in Bond
  Street with a loud backfire--a parodic "voice of authority" that
  rouses "the spirit of religion," "her eyes bandaged tight and her
  lips gaping wide" (<i>MD,</i> 16, 14). Stirring nationalist piety in
  bystanders of every class, this blind spirit of monarchy and monotheism
  constellates analeatory community of spectators marveling at manmade
  miracles, even as transcendencefalls into immanence, revelation into
  high-tech marketing stunts, cathedrals into waxworks,divinely invested
  monarchs into a blank though "enduring symbol" of England's "majesty"
  (<i>MD,</i> 16). Loss of monovocal authority becomes gain as the
  weird enchanting harmonies of irreducible differences surround and
  displace the totalizing "spirit" in their midst.

<p>
Freud's meditations on Europe's future in <i>The Future of an Illusion</i>
and <i>Civilization</i> and Its Discontents illuminate the contending
poetries, or metaphysics, of Miss Kilman's religious belief, England's
nationalist religion, Clarissa's stoic atheism, and, not least, Septimus's
war experience. Consigning religion--"perhaps the most important item
in the psychical inventory of a civilization," without which many feel
life would be intolerable--to humanity's childhood, Freud advocates an
"<i>education to reality</i>" (<i>FI,</i> 81).

<b></b>

Such an education would teach that sexuality and aggression are profound
and ineradicable human instincts; that civilization must continually be
fought for in the unceasing "battle of the giants" Eros and Death for
"world dominion"; and that creative endeavors to make life "tolerable
for everyone and civilization no longer oppressive to anyone" console
for the renunciations civilization demands better than can illusions
of a heavenly afterlife (<i>CD,</i> 69; <i>FI,</i> 82). The European
religions, he complains, depict a cosmos so lacking in rationality and
realism as to reduce believers to childish credulity. They falsely soothe
an infantile "need for a father's protection" from sufferings inflicted
by nature and humanity, exacerbate unconscious aggression and guilt
by holding up impossible ethical ideals such as the Golden Rule, and
foster hopes of "Heaven" that promote passivity and dissipate creative
energies (<i>CD,</i> 19). An "education to reality," by contrast, would
emphasize science, which subjects its accounts of reality to empirical
verification, and art, which claims no transcendent authority. People
so educated would find consolation in scientific understanding of the
world and in such pleasurable pursuits as relationships, thought and
creativity, power to act in and change the world, nature, beauty, and
art. Freed from religion's "bitter-sweet . . . poison," humanity would
grow up: it would abandon fantasies of a beneficent Providence, accept
its helpless and insignificant place in the cosmos, resign itself to
fate (those aspects of life not susceptible of change), and direct its
"liberated energies" toward improving life for all here and now, leaving
"heaven to the angels and the sparrows" (<i>FI,</i> 81-2, 82n).

<p>
When Freud speculated that the "experiment of an irreligious education"
might yield "hope for the future," a "treasure" to "enrich civilization,"
his English publisher--a daughter of agnostics educated at home, not
in institutions long steeped in Church sponsorship--had already created
such treasures.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
  The skeptic Clarissa and the scapegoat Septimus dramatize the power
  of art, thought, and imagination to face reality and console for loss
  in this late age of the world's experience when "simply one doesn't
  believe . . . any more in God"; and the novel's odd-affinities ontology
  and immanent cosmos anticipate Freud's this-worldly philosophy ("BS,"
  158). At the crossroads between modern Europe's (first) civil war
  and its uncertain future, Freud's meditations on the aggression that
  threatens civilization from within resonate with Septimus's message;
  and his advocacy of art, philosophy and science over religious
  "illusion," with Clarissa's arduous belief that "life"--though
  poised over an abyss, unwatched by any Providence, unredeemed by any
  heaven--is "enough" (<i>MD,</i> 121-2).

<p>
Never spoken in so many words, Septimus's message exists as a depth-charge
in his character, story, and fate. A prophetic witness to the aggression
instinctive in human nature and ineradicable from European civilization,
he brings the war home in his very person. He not only exposes his
fellow citizens' "really fearful . . . 'settling down'" as though the
war had never been, as Katherine Mansfield put it; he brings the war
home as <i>their</i> war, <i>their violence</i>, which they disavow in
a contestation of reality to the death.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  Tortured by the memory of Evans blown to bits before his eyes,
  confessing that he has "committed a crime," besieged by guilt at
  being alive but unable to feel, Septimus entertains the possibility
  "that the world itself is without meaning" (<i>MD,</i> 88).

<b></b>

To salvage its <i>meaning</i>, he tries to attest to the collective
murder his civilization has commissioned from him, to offer a "truth"
on which to rebuild civilization more lastingly. While Sir William
Bradshaw and Dr. Holmes--gatekeepers of a society strategically blind
to its own violence--pathologize his reality as "the deferred effects
of shell shock," he tries to "tell the whole world"; when that fails,
he acts out his "astonishing revelation" through his sacrificial death
(<i>MD,</i> 183, 70). Although Septimus loses his life in this poetry
contest, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> captures his "truth" for the real-world
contest between Love and Death that art, like Keynes's "moral book,"
may aspire to influence.

<p>
Septimus too is an elegiac consciousness. Despite his overwhelming grief,
he is not inconsolable but struggles in his own way to survive his
message--to communicate it without being driven insane in the elegiac
progress toward life and the future that his suicide interrupts. Since
his "brain [i]s perfect"--he can read the <i>Inferno</i> and add up
his bill--he surmises that "it must be the fault of the world" that "he
could not feel" (<i>MD,</i> 88). Yet he does feel extremes of ecstasy
and pain as his wavering gaze takes in the ravishing phenomenal world,
its breathtaking beauty intensified in proportion to his devastation. He
is amazed to tears by the mysterious "smoke words languishing and melting
in the sky and bestowing upon him in their inexhaustible charity and
laughing goodness one shape after another of unimaginable beauty and
signalling their intention to provide him, for nothing, for ever, for
looking merely, with beauty, more beauty!" (<i>MD,</i> 21-2). Everything
sings to him: Evans sings "from behind the tree," sparrows sing in
Greek, the word <i>time</i> "split[s] its husk," Rezia's voice lapses
into "contented melody," sounds make "harmonies with premeditation,"
even silence sings, "the spaces between . . . as significant as the
sounds" (<i>MD,</i> 70, 69, 146, 22). His rushing thoughts tumble out
revelation after revelation. "Scientifically speaking," he theorizes,
"the flesh was melted off the world," his body "macerated until only
the nerve fibres were left," "spread like a veil upon a rock"; "I have
been dead and yet am now alive," he hazards (<i>MD,</i> 68-9). To his
"ode to Time" a pastoral, symbolically reborn Evans sings antiphonally
that the dead wait in Thessaly for the war's end when they will return,
then suddenly materializes as Peter Walsh on the path: "'For God's sake
don't come!' . . . But the branches parted. . . . It was Evans! But no
mud was on him; no wounds. . . . I must tell the whole world, Septimus
cried . . . (as the dead man in the grey suit came nearer)" (<i>MD,</i>
70). Where his insupportable memories meet "daylight," the everyday
world splinters into the incandescent visions, music, and poetry that
hold him to life.

Paul Fussell documents the chasm between the incommunicable reality
experienced by the English soldiers at the front and the jingoistic
sentimentality of civilians in England.

  Back "home" ("avoid the use of the word Home," notes Bradshaw),
  Septimus's boss, Mr. Brewer, applauds his distinguished war service and
  promotes him "to a post of considerable responsibility"; Septimus,
  appalled and revolted by the patriotic lies by which his fellow
  Londoners transform collective murder into "pleasurable . . . emotion"
  and himself into a war hero, is diagnosed as mad (<i>H,</i> 138;
  <i>MD,</i> 88). Sir William inquires,

<blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"You served with great distinction in the War?"
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The patient repeated the word "war" interrogatively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was attaching meanings to words of a symbolical kind. A serious
symptom, to be noted on the card.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The War?" the patient asked. The European War--that little shindy of
schoolboys with gunpowder? Had he served with distinction? He really
forgot. In the War itself he had failed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Yes, he served with the greatest distinction," Rezia assured the doctor;
"he was promoted."
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[. . .]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He had committed an appalling crime and been condemned to death by
human nature.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I have--I have--," he began, "committed a crime--"
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"He has done nothing wrong whatever," Rezia assured the doctor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[. . .]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I--I--" he stammered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But what was his crime? He could not remember it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Yes?" Sir William encouraged him. (But it was growing late.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Love, trees, there is no crime--what was his message?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[. . .]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I--I--" Septimus stammered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Try to think as little about yourself as possible," said Sir William
kindly. Really, he was not fit to be about.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[. . .]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Trust everything to me," he said, and dismissed them. [MD, 96, 98]

</blockquote>

<p>
Captured and stilled in the work of art, Septimus's stammer interrupts
the tanklike momentum of the heroic social script ventriloquized by
Rezia and Sir William. Like a vulnerable body before their smoothly
rolling sentences, his broken utterances mark the site of a reality, the
<i>appalling crime</i> of war, against which their supposedly transparent
"sane truth" appears unreal and insane.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
Septimus's doctors act as agents for a society that scapegoats him for
bringing home the murderous aggression it would disavow, that projects
its aggression upon him and expels him, its symbolic embodiment, so that
he seems to bear it away. But the scapegoat who does not suffer silently
turns victimage into prophecy.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  While Rezia, following doctors' orders, exhorts Septimus to "'Look'" at
  the everyday sights in Regent's Park, a different reality absorbs him:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Look the unseen bade him, the voice which now communicated with him who
was the greatest of mankind, Septimus, lately taken from life to death,
the Lord who had come to renew society, . . . suffering for ever, the
scapegoat, the eternal sufferer, but he did not want it, he moaned,
putting from him with a wave of his hand that eternal suffering, that
eternal loneliness. . . . "Oh look," she implored him. But what was
there to look at? A few sheep. That was all. [<i>MD,</i> 25-6]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What are a few sheep to a scapegoat "come to renew society"?--



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the lord of men . . . called forth in advance of the mass of men to hear
the truth, to learn the meaning, which now at last, after all the toils
of civilisation--Greeks, Romans,

<b></b>

Shakespeare, Darwin, and now himself--was to be given whole to . . . "To
whom?" he asked aloud. "To the Prime Minister," the voices which rustled
above his head replied . . . these profound truths which needed, so
deep were they, so difficult, an immense effort to speak out, but the
world was entirely changed by them forever. [<i>MD,</i> 67]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
From his scapegoat's perspective, Septimus's premonition of the "birth
of a new religion" (or an old one always in need of rebirth) is sane
(<i>MD,</i> 23). If the world could avow its violence, would it not
be radically altered, redeemed from its lies, filled with the power to
atone for and even renounce it? Meanwhile, his doctors--civilization's
well-compensated disciplinarians--seek to ensure that the scapegoat
stays a victim: "when a man . . . says he is Christ . . . &amp; has a
message, . . . society appoints the doctor to shut him up till he is
cured. . . . Sir William not only prospered himself but saw to it that
England should prosper too" (<i>H,</i> 149-50; cf. <i>MD,</i> 99). Making
rounds in his sleek motorcar with his wife nestled in silvery furs,
Bradshaw is "the judge, the saviour, the super man, in whose hands powers
of life &amp; death were lodged, torture, isolation; the great gaoler;
the heavy compassionate man, who had seen so much of this sort of thing,
. . . made an excellent after dinner speech, &amp; was at the top of his
tree" (<i>H,</i> 142). As Bradshaw lists reasons why Septimus must not
kill himself ("King George. . . . [D]uty, &amp; self-sacrifice, &amp;
humour &amp; courage &amp; the family"), Septimus muses on the oil
portrait of Lady Bradshaw over the mantelpiece and Bradshaw's income
of "&#163;10,000 a year" and objects, "But life . . . offers no such
bounty to us. . . . And perhaps there is no God. [Sir William] shrugged
his shoulders" (<i>H,</i> 154). Having "devour[ed] Shakespeare, Darwin,
<i>The History of Civilisation,</i> and Bernard Shaw," Septimus grasps
his meaning:the "whole world was clamouring: Kill yourself, kill yourself,
for our sakes" (<i>MD,</i> 85, 92).

<p>
Back "home," in short, Septimus is fated to know "everything," to grasp
"the meaning of the world," and to bear the burden of witnessing his
civilization's unimaginable violence without being driven mad (<i>MD,</i>
66). "The War had taught him," for example, "the message hidden in the
beauty" of even Shakespeare's words, sacred text of the civilization he
went to war to "save":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The secret signal which one generation passes, under disguise, to the
next is loathing, hatred, despair. Dante the same. Aeschylus (translated)
the same. . . . [H]uman beings have neither kindness, nor faith, nor
charity. . . . They hunt in packs . . . scour the desert and vanish
screaming into the wilderness. They desert the fallen. . . . Brewer at the
office, . . . brutality blared out on placards; men were trapped in mines;
women burnt alive; and once a maimed file of lunatics . . . ambled and
nodded and grinned past him. . . . And would <i>he</i> go mad? [<i>MD,</i>
86, 88-90]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Lone witness of a reality that everyone around him denies, Septimus fends
off madness even as this incommunicable reality consumes the mundane
world. Beckoning airplanes, whispering trees, birds speaking Greek,
Evans cleansed and whole--all threaten to "sen[d] him mad. But he would
not go mad. He would shut his eyes; he would see no more" (<i>MD,</i> 22).

<p>
Septimus's "insane truth" is still truth, in face of which "not to be
mad would amount to another form of madness."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
  He suffers, owns, and tries to bear witness to his

<b></b>

civilization's "appalling crime" but is finally forced to reenact it
through a death that he <i>expects to be read</i>--a death that he
offers as a gift, and that the narrative insulates from dismissal as
madness. Bathed in the light of his last afternoon, he tests his sanity,
looking cautiously at objects in his room and finding with relief that
"None of these things moved. All were still; all were real"; "He would
not go mad" (<i>MD,</i> 142). He does "not want to die":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
why should he kill himself for their sakes? . . . Besides . . . there
was a luxury in it, an isolation full of sublimity; a freedom which the
attached can never know. Holmes had won of course. . . . But even Holmes
. . . could not touch this last relic straying on the edge of the world,
this outcast, who gazed back at the inhabited regions, who lay, like a
drowned sailor, on the shore of the world. [<i>MD,</i> 92-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The sun feels hot, life good, the future full of possibilities that emerge
in miniature in the hat he and Rezia, laughing together "like married
people," create for Mrs. Peters (<i>MD,</i> 143). Now the world's found
order ("Mrs. Peters had a spiteful tongue. Mr. Peters was in Hull")
seems not in the least "terrible"; his writings and drawings seem
"insane. all about death, nightingales"; his fear of "falling down,
down into the flames!" momentarily abates: "Miracles, revelations,
agonies, loneliness, falling through the sea, . . . all were burnt out,
for he had a sense, as he watched Rezia trimming the straw hat . . . of
a coverlet of flowers" (<i>H,</i> 313; <i>MD,</i> 141-3). He foreknows
that he must sacrifice his elegiac progress, perform the revelation no
one heeds. But, feeling "Every power pour[] its treasures on his head"
as his heart sings "Fear no more," he delays "till the very last moment"
the death in which two realities converge: the suicide his society
demands and, as Clarissa somehow divines, "an attempt to communicate"
(<i>MD,</i> 139, 149, 184). He is pushed, yet he also jumps. He frames
his death as the antithesis of madness, "an immense effort to speak out"
difficult, "profound truths"; an offering, a sacrifice, a gift to "human
beings": "what did <i>they</i> want? . . . 'I'll give it you!' he cried"
(<i>MD,</i> 149). Might recognition of his gift not help refound his
civilization on firmer, more lasting ground? If so, is he mad to think
that he dies for the sins of the world, dies so that others may live?

<p>
Through the artwork that reclaims his death from obscurity, Septimus
bequeathes his message to the future. His suicide, pathologized by Sir
William and Richard to promote the shell shock bill, is received by
Clarissa precisely as a message: "defiance," a Houdini-like escape from
soul-destroying doctors, a Shelleyan "plunge[] holding his treasure"
(<i>MD,</i> 184; cf. <i>H,</i> 386, where Shelley's name appears). In
her spontaneous private elegy for him, his death inversely mirrors
her life. Echoing "Adonais," she reflects that the living "would grow
old," he never. By flinging his life away he has preserved "a thing
. . . that mattered," something "defaced, obscured in her own life," lost
"every day in corruption, lies, chatter" (<i>MD,</i> 184). In opposing
truth/treasure/death to lies/corruption/life, Clarissa confronts her
own Conversion--her compromised treasure, Sally's kiss. Channeling her
own rage and grief into social contestation, she indicts Sir William as
Conversion's agent--"a great doctor yet to her obscurely evil,

<b></b>

without sex or lust, extremely polite to women, but capable of
some indescribable outrage--forcing your soul"; such men "make life
intolerable" (<i>MD,</i> 184-5).

<p>
We shall return in a moment to the sexual crises Clarissa's language
evokes. Now Clarissa's anger turns inward as existential "terror,"
an "awful fear" of having wasted her life, seizes her: "it was her
disaster--her disgrace . . . her punishment. . . . She had schemed; she
had pilfered. She was never wholly admirable. She had wanted success. Lady
Bexborough and the rest of it. And once she had walked on the terrace at
Bourton" (<i>MD,</i> 185). At last she makes peace with her own defection
from love's "sublimity" as the price of the life with Richard that she
simply likes and, accepting this reality, glimpses her survival and
future in the old woman in the window opposite (<i>H,</i> 390). Rising
like a sylvan goddess in her green dress, Clarissa concludes her small
elegy with Septimus's fate and her own in equipoise:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she did not pity him. . . . Fear no more the heat of the sun. . . . She
felt somehow very like him . . . glad that he had done it; thrown
it away. The clock was striking. The leaden circles dissolved in the
air. He made her feel the beauty; made her feel the fun. But she must
go back. [<i>MD,</i> 186]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Elegy's brutal principle of substitution dictates the emotional logic by
which the unknown young man's death helps her to embrace life, beauty,
fun, her party, all her consolations in face of time and inexorable
loss--"That's what I do it for" (<i>MD,</i> 121). Her elegiac progress
repeats in small her navigation from Sylvia's death through perilous
grief and rage to the existential consolation simply "that one day should
follow another," that she should "wake up in the morning; see the sky;
walk in the park; meet Hugh Whitbread; then suddenly in came Peter;
then these roses; it was enough" (<i>MD,</i> 122).

<p>
If Clarissa's elegy for Septimus is inadequate to arraign the world before
the truths it brands madness, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> captures his message
within its fictional bounds for the world beyond them. Not Clarissa but
we readers receive (or not) the message of Septimus's death, the costs of
the war he names a "crime," the measure of what his life means to him, the
infinite possibilities of his unfurling days. Meanwhile, Clarissa reflects
on her conversion, acknowledges loss, and affirms the consolations that
reward the elegist's exigent bowing to reality. Let's return now to
Clarissa's brief flare of rage at Sir William, which illuminates the
protagonists' elegiac doubling as a splitting of authorial voice into
the sane survivor and the insane war veteran whom Woolf created partly
out of herself: "S's character. founded on R[upert Brooke?]? . . . or
founded on me? . . . might be left vague--as a mad person is . . . so can
be partly R.; partly me" (<i>H,</i> 418). Traces in the novel's genetic
text illuminate Woolf's transmutation of her harrowing experience of
"madness," and of the losses, grief, and rage that fueled it, into an
elegiac work of art that might influence the world. The Septimus who is
"partly" Woolf, these traces suggest, dies not only for his society's
"crime" of war but also for the violence that its ruling "father[s]"
visit upon women.

These words belong to a draft sequence that leads from Rezia's despairing
thoughts in Harley Street to Lady Bruton's luncheon. The London medical
establishment's "truth" forcibly embraces a "miserable rag &amp;
relic" of a soul who comes "fluttering . . . bereft of shelter, shade,
or refuge, naked, defenceless," to suffer "the terrific stamp of Sir
Williams rage. He swooped; he devoured. . . . Such decision, combined
with humanity, . . . endeared Sir William greatly to the relations of his
victims" (<i>H,</i> 155; cf. <i>MD,</i> 99-101). No reader of Woolf's
letters about her incarceration in a home for the insane could fail to
sense here the remembered "mad" "me" on which she drew for Septimus nor
the "raging furnace" of feelings about "madness and doctors and being
forced" that she "kept cooling in [her] mind" for years before she could
"touch it without bursting into flame all over."

  Refracting Septimus's war traumas through her experiences of the
  social system in action, Woolf discloses and disguises the tangled
  sources of "madness" in familial and societal dynamics, including her
  Duckworth half-brothers' incestuous abuse, the reactions of family,
  friends, and doctors to this history, her relations' power over her
  incarceration, and the pressures of "Proportion" and "Conversion"
  (<i>MD,</i> 100). In <i>The Hours</i> Septimus, like Woolf's "mad
  . . . me," hears nightingales sing Greek, Philomela's incestuous
  violation retooled to his war experience: "Evans was a Greek
  nightingale . . . &amp; now sang this ode, about death . . . 'And so
  I reached Greece'; where he joined the poets, in Thessaly" (<i>H,</i>
  66). In <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> nightingales become sparrows singing "in
  voices prolonged and piercing in Greek words, from trees in the meadow
  of life beyond a river where the dead walk, how there is no death"
  (<i>MD,</i> 24-5). Yet Septimus never ceases to be "partly" the ghost
  of that "me" who signed herself "Sparroy" to Violet Dickinson--one
  friend who could grasp a "truth" that might as well have been Greek
  to the society that exalted George Duckworth.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>

<p>
In creating a war veteran "partly" out of that former "me," Woolf
foreshadows her analysis in <i>Three Guineas</i> of the war at home,
the abuses of women under the social law of masculine and heterosexual
privilege. In <i>The Hours</i> and <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> women's telling
of truth and lies dramatizes their negotiations of elegiac inheritance,
sexuality, and social law in a civilization being rebuilt, perhaps,
on firmer ground. As Sacks observes, the critical question of communal
inheritance from the dead implicates the mourners' sexuality psychically
and legally. The old crises of narcissism and sexuality that mourning
awakens, inheritance must somehow resolve. Through same-sex attractions,
intimations of incest and madness, and conversion dramas, <i>The Hours</i>
and <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> expose systemic social violence as it governs
inheritance, dictates the

<b></b>

mourner's sexuality, and provokes the violent energies that the elegy
diverts from tragic enactment into social critique. More specifically,
women must choose between challenging social law and submitting to
it in exchange for socioeconomic rewards. Submission to the Goddess
of Conversion, as Clarissa knows, entails lies--silences, omissions,
censorship. Thus Lady Bradshaw has "gone under" fifteen years earlier:
"a nervous twitch" signals something "really painful to believe--that
the poor lady lied"; and Clarissa contrasts Septimus's uncorrupted
"treasure" with her youthful passion, renounced and now obscured by
"lies, corruption, chatter," as she consoles herself with the pleasures
her bargain has bought her (<i>MD,</i> 100-1). This recognition--her
legacy from Septimus--weighs conversion's advantages against its costs:
"she did not pity him"; she too has felt, "if it were now to die 'twere
now to be most happy"; still, life is enough (<i>MD,</i> 186, 184, 35).

<p>
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> depicts a social system in which sexual desire
and practice often diverge from law and publicity. Founded, as
Freud points out, on the suppression of women's desire, civilization
<i>sanctions</i>--punishes yet permits--incest and same-sex desire:
"incest is anti-social and civilization consists in a progressive
renunciation of it" ; "we may justly hold our civilization
responsible for the spread of neurasthenia" .
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  As Freud explains the contradiction, the incest taboo imposes
  "perhaps the most drastic mutilation" of erotic life that civilization
  exacts; it is thus incompletely renounced in modern society. Although
  civilization polices sexuality as if it were a subject people--it fears
  revolt, enacts strict precautions, and inflicts "serious injustice"
  by dictating "a single kind of sexual life for everyone"--it cannot
  actually enforce its prohibitions and so must "pass over in silence
  many transgressions which, according to its own rescripts, it ought
  to have punished" (<i>CD,</i> 51-2). When Clarissa judges Sir William
  "obscurely evil, without sex or lust, extremely polite to women,
  but capable of some indescribable outrage," her specific exclusion of
  "sex or lust" in a context that has not raised any such issue invisibly
  flags a ghost of Woolf's "mad . . . me" who survives the doctor's dead
  patient. In <i>The Hours</i> her owning of Septimus's death as her
  disaster and disgrace leads to a vehement vow to "t Sir William
  Bradshaw. . . . She must go back; breast her enemy. . . . Never
  would she submit--never, never!" (<i>H,</i> 398-9). Later excised,
  this rather uncharacteristic outburst of social conscience alerts us
  to other scattered and muted deflections of violated sexuality in
  both texts, traces of Woolf's own negotiation of social law in the
  course of writing the novel.

<p>
Hard on the heels of the doctor so esteemed by his victims' relations,
<i>The Hours</i> portrays Hugh Whitbread, who regularly brings his wife
Evelyn (frequently visited by Clarissa "in a nursing home") to London
"to see doctors" (<i>MD,</i> 6). A freehand portrait of the incestuous
George Duckworth, the "admirable Hugh" captures his smug prosperity,
sartorial magnificence, "little job at Court," and the "scrupulou[s]
little courtesies &amp; old fashioned ways" that have kept him "afloat
on the cream of English society for fifty-five years"--just George's
age in 1923.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
  Although Hugh is one of the few characters into whose psychic cave
  the narrator does not venture, the ur-narrator hints sardonically at
  what his impeccable facade conceals: "a little information about the
  subconscious self &amp; Dr Freud had leaked into him"; "He had heard
  of Freud &amp; Stravinsky. . . .

<b></b>

His affections were understood to be deep"; "one or two humble reforms
to his credit" include his undersigning of many long "letters on girls,
&amp; stamp out . . . nuisances [<i>sic</i>]," "nor did any girl lose
her place in his household without being kept sight of" (<i>H,</i>
156-7). <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> leaves all this on the cuttingroom floor,
substituting a double entendre ("malicious" rumors that Hugh "now kept
guard at Buckingham Palace, dressed in silk stockings and knee-breeches,
over what nobody knew") and an oblique note that "servant girls had
reason to be grateful to him" (<i>MD,</i> 103).

<p>
The ur-narrator now hands off Hugh, swathed in innuendo, to Lady Bruton's
secretary, Milly Brush, who is so irritated by his inquiries after her
brother that "she was almost inclined to tell him about her brother,
except that she was almost killed her brother [denied once that she]
told a lie once about her brother. &amp; would have done so, had it not
seemed <i>margin</i>: never let on that her brother was not" (<i>H,</i>
157). Was the ur-Milly Brush almost killed [by] her brother, or did she
almost kill him--or, as her self-interfering grammar suggests, both? What
does she deny/lie about, deny lying about, and/or never let on about? Who
or what was or is her brother, or was/is he not? <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s
narrator affects not to know, indeed, tells us less: Hugh always asks
"after her brother in South Africa, which, for some reason, Miss Brush
. . . so much resented that she said 'Thank you, he's doing very well
in South Africa,' when, for half a dozen years, he had been doing badly
in Portsmouth" (<i>MD,</i> 103). As the narrative screws down the lid
over a site of near-fatal sibling violence, Milly Brush silently mocks
her interlocutor with the subaltern's lie.

<p>
Nothing in <i>The Hours</i> or <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> suggests scattered
cinders from Woolf's furnace of white-hot memories more vividly than
the narrative convergence of this brother, Milly's incoherent lies, and
the George-like Hugh, so solicitous, as it were, of servant girls, in a
scene that covertly links the gender dynamics surrounding revelations of
sexual violence to women's public speech. The specter of gender-marked
"madness" (and familially engineered incarceration) as implements in the
social control of "truth" hovers over the ur-Miss Brush, who seems to
survive her separate sorrows by sheltering under her powerful employer's
wing--a shadowy, diminished double of Lady Millicent Bruton. For her part,
Lady Bruton "should have been a general of dragoons" but exhibits her
own crippled relation to truth, speech, and social power in her "battle"
to compose a letter to the <i>Times,</i> for which, feeling "the futility
of her own womanhood as she felt it on no other occasion," she finally
commandeers the expertise of none other than Hugh (<i>MD,</i> 105, 109).

<p>
Hugh's sleaziness emerges more explicitly in the drama of truth and lies
surrounding a rumor that he once kissed Sally Seton in the smoking-room
at Bourton. (Innocuous as it sounds, the furor around this incident
suggests that, like Richard's kiss in <i>The Voyage Out,</i> it stands in
for sexual transgressions ruled unspeakable by actual and internalized
censors.) Having fled her "intolerable" home for Bourton, the brilliant
young rebel Sally educated the "sheltered" Clarissa in "sex . . . social
problems . . . life, how they were to reform the world" and "abolish
private property" (<i>H,</i> 43; <i>MD,</i> 33). In <i>The Hours</i>
Peter recalls a heated debate on women's suffrage, he and Sally pro,
Richard and Hugh con:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Prostitutes . . . came in; &amp; "the poor women in Piccadilly" she
called them; &amp; Hugh flushed, &amp; hitched his trousers up. . . . He
said nobody could tell what his mother meant to him . . . &amp; Sally
was down right rude &amp; echoed "your mother of course your mother["]
. . . she told Hugh that he represented all that was most detestable
in the British middle classes. She considered him responsible for the
state of those poor girls. [<i>H,</i> 76, 86]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sally, it seems, taxed Hugh with complicity in a social system in which
middle- and upper-class men exploit lower-class women to preserve the
supposed purity of their disenfranchised mothers, wives, and daughters,
and he retaliated by forcing himself on her sexually.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
  Peter's memory is hampered by the fact that "nobody ever knew what
  happened--it was considered too awful--whether he kissed her or not,
  merely brushed against her, . . . it had to be hushed up . . . Clarissa
  murmured something mysterious--but nobody could believe a word against
  the admirable Hugh, . . . always a perfect gentleman" (<i>H,</i>
  79). At the party Sally confirms the story and adds that Clarissa
  "Simply laughed" when she went to her "in a rage" (<i>H,</i> 403). In
  <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> Clarissa sees "her old friend Hugh, talking
  to the Portuguese Ambassador," and recalls how Sally accused him,
  "of all people . . . of kissing her in the smoking-room" (that male
  preserve), so that Clarissa had



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
to persuade her not to denounce him at family prayers--which she was
capable of doing with her daring, her recklessness, her melodramatic love
of being the centre of everything and creating scenes, and it was bound
. . . to end in some awful tragedy; her death; her martyrdom; instead of
which she had married, quite unexpectedly, a bald man . . . who owned
. . . cotton mills at Manchester. And she had five boys! [<i>MD,</i>
181-2]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Nowhere to be found in the suffrage debate, Clarissa defended Hugh "of
all people" by silencing Sally at family prayers, of all places--family
piety the cornerstone of a social system that protects men like Hugh by
hushing up "truth" in the name of a hypocritical propriety.

<p>
Yet in her own mind Clarissa is not simply protecting Hugh but saving
Sally from her own reckless idealism--from "awful tragedy," "death,"
"martyrdom." Her reaction stages the question of what genre shall govern
Sally's life: the revenge tragedy that denouncing Hugh to a society
that is a father might set in motion? a martyrdom like Septimus's? or an
elegiac conversion narrative like her own? Notwithstanding the ur-Clarissa
who vows to t her "enemy" and never submit, Clarissa has submitted
to social law for the sake of life, beauty, fun. She recoils from the
danger of ting for truth and dictates conversion--lies--for Sally,
too. And her influence takes. Sally, "that romantic, that brilliant
creature" whose kiss ("a sudden revelation," "an illumination," "the
religious feeling!") holds out a protestant alternative to the patriarchal
religion of family prayers, and who shares Clarissa's "obscure dread"
of marriage ("catastrophe," "doom," "going out to be slaughtered"),
marries "a rich . . . cotton spinner" and has "five enormous boys"--a
generic outcome that strikes Peter as "a little off the mark" (<i>H,</i>
80, 47; <i>MD,</i> 32, 34-5, 171).

<b></b>

<p>
The Goddess of Conversion could display no prouder trophy than Lady
Rosseter. The bold and visionary Sally suppresses her passion for
truth to become a very paragon of conventional prosperous matronhood,
amply rewarded by social position, the sexual fulfillment her teeming
progeny suggest, and a leisurely country life in which she rarely reads
a newspaper. Her conversion affirms Freud's gendered divide between a
"civilization" that "has become increasingly the business of men," who
sustain it through "instinctual sublimations of which women are little
capable," and women's familial and sexual domain, which civilization
"force[s] into the background" (<i>CD,</i> 50-1). Whereas the penniless
Sally would "reform the world" on behalf of women and the poor, the
complacent Lady Rosseter has converted her claim on her civilization's
future into individual salvation through a marriage that indeed spells
doom for Sally's "Radical" politics (<i>MD,</i> 154).

<p>
Lady Rosseter's conversion attests to civilization's deep pockets
in buying off witnesses to the barbarities within--to some extent,
the lying Milly Brush suggests, even that seventh child Virginia, who
hid truth behind fiction's "immense facades" in forging her former "mad
. . . me" into Septimus. Yet the sibylline testimony of <i>The Hours</i>
and <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> intimates the ways Woolf's elegiac art mediated
the memories of incest, madness, and social law that threatened to
immolate her. The genres open to that remembered "me" would seem to
correspond roughly to the fates Clarissa pictures for Sally: a tragic
death by unjust social law; unsung martyrdom; suicide as an "embrace" or
"attempt to communicate"; revenge, or the eruption of grief into murderous
rage; elegiac conversion. In transforming that fluttering, bereft, naked,
miserable, defenceless rag and relic of a soul into Septimus--one of
the most astonishing characters in modern literature--Woolf wrests
from her losses, grief, and life-threatening rage this work of art:
a symbolic inheritance that lays her old self to rest (at least for a
time) by bringing her to "life." As Clarissa's small elegy for Septimus
is also an elegy for a buried self, Woolf's great postwar elegy for
"all deaths &amp; sorrows" enfolds a secret elegy for a self her art
resurrects from ignominious death for something like tragedy or martyrdom,
barely legible as she is in the work's palimpsest.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  Septimus--not just his death but the life of suffering and
  witness that endows its gift--is her monument, a fictional facade
  over autobiographical truth in a work of art that arraigns its
  civilization and holds it responsible to itself for what it is. In
  ventriloquizing her "mad" "me" through Septimus, Woolf heeds yet
  eludes the censors--Dr. Savage, Kitty, Julia, George, even perhaps
  Vanessa--that her fluttering relic of a soul must have heard cry,
  Kill yourself, for our sakes.

<p>
In vanquishing the life-threatening forces that beset her, Woolf,
like Clarissa, emerges as an elegist-hero who ts death and the
void and returns from the battlefield bearing trophies of consolation,
flaunting her powers of survival: "A new [elegy] by Virginia Woolf";
"This is what I have made of it!" (<i>MD,</i> 43, cf. <i>EE,</i>
226). A triumph of elegiac conversion, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> transforms
a destroyed "mad . . . me" into a symbolic consolation in which she,
disguised as Septimus, poor devil of both sexes, dies for the sins
of the world, dies so that others may live. He does not want it. Why
"rage and prophesy? Why fly scourged and outcast?" (<i>MD,</i> 142)
Why indeed? Not because he is insane

<b></b>

but because the world is; only because the sins and wounds of the world,
and its consequent madness and art--not least, this postwar elegy with
its arduous celebration of "life"--demand it. No guiltier than anyone
else, his only "crime" to have tried to bear (in both senses) witness,
Septimus dies for the "terrific" institutionalized violence that Harley
Street commits against defenceless naked souls, for the admirable Hugh's
less admirable acts, for Milly Brush's suppressed history, Clarissa's
defection, and Lady Rosseter's conversion, as well as Europe's vengeful
crimes against its future, the Great War and the violent Peace.

<p>
But if no one in the novel fully claims the symbolic legacy evoked in
Septimus's last words, and if <i>The Hours</i> preserves smoldering
"truths" that even <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> cannot openly explore, how can
anyone think that art might influence the world? What force can art exert
toward change, when to t is out of character for Clarissa, conversion
so far the norm that even Sally succumbs, and Septimus's death a silent
testimony that leaves even the fictional world unchanged--while the actual
world grinds on toward the revenge tragedy for which Versailles set the
stage, horrendously enacting Hitler's 1922 vow: "It cannot be that two
million Germans should have fallen in vain. . . . No, we do not pardon,
we demand--vengeance!"
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
As powerless as the eloquence of Keynes and Freud to forestall another
civil war, Woolf's elegiac art battles alongside them on the side of Love
for a future that history had not yet, in 1925, foreclosed. Further,
and in keeping with the expansive web of conscious and unconscious
being that Clarissa theorizes on the bus, the novel does depict a
changing world even if no one seems to be directly changing it. To
Peter his dear old civilization seems freer, less repressed and much
improved, especially for women: "Newspapers seemed different. Now for
instance there was a man writing quite openly in one of the respectable
weeklies about water-closets. That you couldn't have done ten years ago"
(<i>MD,</i> 71). As a young man on whose "love of abstract principles"
"the future of civilization" rests, he advocated women's suffrage; now
"women's rights" are an "antediluvian topic" (<i>MD,</i> 50, 73). As he
strolls to the party on an evening marvelously lengthened by that postwar
innovation "summer time," he delights in the spectacle of beautiful,
well-dressed young people and (unlike fellow Anglo-Indians devoted to
"biliously summing up the ruin of the world") "more than suspect[s] from
the words of a girl, from a housemaid's laughter--intangible things you
couldn't lay your hands on--that shift in the whole pyramidal accumulation
which in his youth had seemed immovable" and had "weighed them down, the
women especially" (<i>MD,</i> 162). Echoing Woolf's essay "Mr. Bennett
and Mrs. Brown" , which proves by cooks borrowing newspapers and
parlor maids trying on hats that "human character" has changed, Peter
senses an exhilarating forward motion in postwar civilization that no
single life--not his, Sally's, Clarissa's, Septimus's, nor even that of
Elizabeth, who would like a profession but is "rather lazy"--can account
for (<i>MD,</i> 137).
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  Yet there it is.

<p>
Lady Rosseter's conversion, moreover, represents no <i>final</i> defeat
of Sally's reformist hopes, since <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> also immortalizes
Sally, ever streaking Bourton's corridor after her sponge like a modern
successor to Keats's beleaguered maiden. And of course art may inspire
readers to act upon their social worlds not by representing

<b></b>

change but by exposing the social system in action. Precisely because its
characters defect, convert, fail of speech, die, lie, and "go under,"
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> carries the "t" to rebuild civilization on
firmer ground into a future that is always becoming in the wake of the
work of art--the future of its readers, whose myriad-minded creativity
the skywriting airplane's beholders only suggest. Woolf, meanwhile,
triumphed over loss, grief, and maddening rage to reach fresh woods and
pastures new--to write her books, found her press, and persevere into the
next war as "the only woman in England free to write what I like"--and
she felt, on finishing her great communal elegy, no longer "inclined to
doff the cap to death": "More &amp; more do I repeat . . . 'Its life that
matters'" (<i>D,</i> 3:43, 7-8, 8 n. 5; 22 September, 8 April 1925). If
water closets in respectable weeklies now, perhaps Milly Brush's brother
soon? For the moment, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> embraces the world as it is,
letting Milly, Clarissa, Hugh, and Lady Rosseter live while Septimus
dies for his civilization's barbarities--the sexual violence buried in
this novel's news of the day no less than the war on its front page.

<i>EE,</i> 8f. I agree that there is "substantial overlap in men's and
women's mourning" and that a woman's mourning recapitulates the loss
of the mother and "her internalization and identification with the
idealized parent re"; but Woolf translates psychoanalytic theory's
androcentric terms of art into the ontological loss and sexual wounding
inherent in being, distinct from the systemic, socially-inflicted losses
women suffer through "male culture's establishment of an almost exclusive
relation between masculinity and the res of authority" (<i>EE,</i>

"dramatizing strategy" that calls attention through ritual and ceremony to

contestants channel grief into skill as they contend over the communal

Jovanovich, 1948); "BS," 152-9. I cite the Clarissas by publication
date, but Woolf composed <i>The Voyage Out</i> between 1908 and 1913,
"Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street" in 1922, and <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>
in 1923-24. As she approached <i>The Hours</i> (composed 1923-24) she
expressed dissatisfaction with the 1923 Clarissa ("Mrs Dalloway doesn't
seem to me to be complete as she is," <i>L,</i> 3:45, 4 June 1923);
<i>Orlando</i>'s draft takes a last swipe at her: "'There's that tiresome
Mrs. Dalloway!' recognizing a lady [Orlando] very much disliked looking
in at a glove shop window" (<i>Orlando: A Biography,</i> ed. J. H. Stape
[Oxford: Blackwell, 1998], Appendix A: 170 3Pr 1E 1A).

Elegies often re the mother's symbolic loss, whether understood
ontologically as differentiation contingent on birth or in sexual
terms as oedipal prohibition, as her literal death; thus a guest tells
Clarissa that she looks "so like her mother as she first saw her walking
in a garden in a grey hat," bringing tears to her eyes (<i>MD,</i>
176). Sacks discusses Amy Clampitt's redressing of the tradition's
"multiple exclusion or occlusion of res representing the mother" in
"Procession at Candlemas" (<i>EE,</i> 325).

As Sacks remarks, "Adonais," completed the year before Shelley's enactment
of its closing lines, drives the genre "to the brink of . . . ruin"
(<i>EE,</i> 165). In a letter of 18 May 1933, Woolf described "sitting,
by an open window, by a balcony, by the bay in which Shelley was drowned,
wasn't he, 113 [actually 111] years ago, on a hot day like this . . . Mary
Shelley and Mary Williams walked up and down the balcony of the house next
door [Casa Magni] waiting while Shelleys body rolled round with pearls--it
is the best death bed place I've ever seen" (<i>The Letters of Virginia
Woolf,</i> ed. Nigel Nicolson and Joanne Trautmann [New York: Harcourt,
Brace, Jovanovich, 1975-80], 5:186-7; hereafter abbreviated <i>L</i>). I

a dying age" and lacks "political vision and fortitude" .

On 14 April 1922 Woolf told T. S. Eliot that she expected to finish
this story in three to six weeks (<i>L,</i> 2:521). In August
she told Ottoline Morrell that she had finished two Mrs. Dalloway
stories (teasingly referred to as "my Garsington novel") (<i>L,</i>
2:543)--apparently prematurely, for on 28 August she planned to finish
"Mrs Dalloway" on "Sat. 2nd Sept" and then to work on "the next chapter
of Mrs. D. . . . The Prime Minister?" until "say Oct. 12th" (<i>D,</i>
2:196). A plan dated 6 October lists eight titles: "Mrs. Dalloway in
Bond Street," "The Prime Minister," "Ancestors," "A dialogue," "The old
ladies," "Country house?," "Cut flowers," and "The Party" (<i>H,</i>
411); cf. <i>Mrs. Dalloway's Party,</i> ed. Stella McNichol (New York:
HBJ, 1973). "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street" appeared in the <i>Dial</i>
in July 1923; Woolf sent it and another story to Eliot on 4 June for
the <i>Criterion,</i> but he published neither.

Jacqueline E. M. Latham, "The Model for Clarissa Dalloway--Kitty Maxse,"
<i>Notes and Queries</i> 214 (July 1969): 262-3, finds no condolence
letter from Woolf among the five hundred-odd in the Maxse papers at
Chichester; she prints a letter from Virginia to Kitty, probably of
summer 1905 when the Maxses visited the Stephen children at Carbis Bay
in Cornwall (Bell, <i>Virginia Woolf,</i> 1:195).

For other interpretations of Woolf's remark in "I" see Edward Mendelson,
"The Death of Clarissa Dalloway: Two Readings," in <i>Textual Analysis:
Some Readers Reading,</i> ed. Mary Ann Caws (New York: MLA Press,
1986), 272-80; and "RRD," 176-201. Mendelson makes (and rebuts)
the case that Clarissa does die, citing her fear of death, the heart
condition that makes her sleep alone in a narrow, coffinlike bed, Peter's
vision of her "falling where she stood, in her drawing-room" on hearing
St. Margaret's bells toll "for death that surprised in the midst of life"
("No! No! . . . She is not dead! I am not old, he cried, and marched
up Whitehall, as if there rolled down to him, vigorous, unending,
his future"), and her sudden vanishing from her party (<i>MD,</i>
50). Miller frames Woolf's storytelling as "the repetition of the past"
in the characters' memories and that of the narrator, who "remembers all"
and "resurrect[s] the past": an "invisible mind . . . more powerful than
their own," she "rescues them from the past," "registers with infinite
delicacy their every thought and steals their every secret," and "speaks
for them all," "'after' anything [they] think or feel"; thus "narration
is repetition as the raising of the dead" and Clarissa's return to her
party, her "resurrection from the dead" ("RRD," 176-9, 201).

<p>
<a name="FOOT28" href="#REF28">28</a>.
For Lytton Strachey this compound Kitty/Woolf registered as a
"discrepancy in Clarissa herself; he thinks she is disagreeable
&amp; limited, but that I alternately laugh at her, &amp; cover her,
very remarkably, with myself. . . . I think there is some truth in
it. For I remember the night at Rodmell when I decided to give it up,
because I found Clarissa in some way tinselly. Then <i>I invented her
memories.</i> But I think some distaste for her persisted. Yet, again,
that was true to my feeling for Kitty" (<i>D,</i> 3:32, 18 June 1925;
emphasis mine). Woolf lent Clarissa her girlhood passion for Madge
Vaughan ("I see myself now standing in the night nursery at Hyde Park
Gate . . . saying . . . 'At this moment she isactually under this roof"
(<i>D,</i> 2:122, 2 June 1921; cf. <i>MD,</i> 51) and experience of
"Constantinople" (often a code word for lesbian love), and otherwise
freed her from fact (e.g., that Kitty had no children).

<p>
<a name="FOOT29" href="#REF29">29</a>.
Woolf depicts Julia Stephen's antifeminism in Mrs. Ramsay and recalls her
stern rebuke when Kitty broke her first engagement in "22 Hyde Park Gate"
(<i>MB,</i> 165).

. Virginia's half-sister Stella Duckworth died in 1897.

<i>H,</i> 411. Sacks relates the elegy's cut and broken branches and
flowers to the "vegetation god, whose death and rebirth governed
the phases of the rites" and "allowed the devotees or survivors
to . . . intensify their grief or gratitude regarding an otherwise
manifold and ungraspable world of nature"; the withering vegetation also
symbolically "reverses man's submission to nature," which becomes no
longer "the <i>cause</i> of human grief but rather the mourner or even
the effect of a human-divine loss" (<i>EE,</i> 20-1). On Jane Harrison's
influence upon Woolf's vegetation imagery, see Beverly Ann Schlack,

Posthumous derives from Latin <i>posthumus</i> "erroneously (by
association with <i>humus</i> earth, ground, as if referring to burial)
for <i>postumus</i> last, superl. of <i>posterus</i>" (<i>OED</i>). As
Sacks points out, Guiderius/Polydore and Arviragus/Cadwal first sang
"Fear no more," their dirge for Imogen/Fidele, for their dead mother,
Euriphile (<i>EE,</i> 18).

Building on Elizabeth Abel's reading of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> as a
"progression from a pastoral female world to an urban culture governed by
men" (<i>Virginia Woolf and the Fictions of Psychoanalysis</i> [Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1989], 42), Joseph Allen Boone relates this
passage to Nancy Chodorow's theories of female psychological development
(<i>Libidinal Currents: Sexuality and the Making of Modernism</i>
[Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998], 187).

For example, kissing Peter in her drawingroom stirs "the brandishing
of silver flashing--plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in
her breast"; when Elizabeth barges in, Big Ben strikes the half hour
"with extraordinary vigour, as if a young man, strong, indifferent,
inconsiderate, were swinging dumb-bells this way and that" (<i>MD,</i>

Keynes had lived in the communal household at 38 Brunswick Square with
Virginia, Adrian, Duncan Grant, and Leonard Woolf. Before Versailles
Woolf wrote rather satirically of his "prophecies" about Lloyd George
and England's economic future (<i>L,</i> 2:208, 1 January 1918); later
she recorded his resignation from the peace talks (<i>D,</i> 1:280,
288; 10 June, 8 July 1919). In 1921 she praised his Memoir Club piece
"Dr Melchior" (<i>L,</i> 2:456, 3 February).

<i>MD,</i> 125. Miss Kilman's historical model was the classical scholar
Louise Ernestine Matthaei (1880-1969), Fellow and Director of Studies
at Newnham from 1909, who was forced out in 1916 "under a cloud";
she explained to Leonard, "my father was a German. I find it makes
a good deal of difference--it is a distinct hindrance commercially"
(<i>D,</i> 1:135-6, 135 n, 14, 9 April 1918). Woolf recorded Leonard's
intention to hire her on the <i>International Review</i> at a salary of
&#163;200-250 (<i>D,</i> 1:143, 21 April 1918). The resentful, belligerent
Miss Kilman has nothing of Matthaei's "limp, apologetic attitude,"
her "odious" reluctance "to declare her opinions--as if a dog used to
excessive beating, dreaded even the raising of a hand" but shares her
"unattractive" person, blotchy complexion, "inconceivably stiff &amp;
ugly" dress, and "quick mind" (<i>D,</i> 1:136).

<p>

<i>MD,</i> 124. Masami Usui notes Miss Kilman's association with Quaker
peace activism and relates her to international struggles for women's

University Press, 1991), esp. 158-63; cf. Zwerdling, <i>Virginia Woolf

The Inverted World of <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i>" in <i>Virginia Woolf:

Forms of recompense include: protection against natural forces; material
wealth and comfort, which accrue to individuals and classes in greater
and lesser degrees; the "mental wealth" of cultural identity, political
ideals, communal pride, art, religious ideas, and science; and such
personal satisfactions as drugs, love, "cultivat[ing] one's garden,"
beauty, work, and the "pleasure principle" by which individuals adapt so
as to gain all possible gratification from their environment (<i>FI,</i>
16; <i>CD</i> 22-3). For Freud as for Keynes, civilization encompasses,
on the one hand, all the knowledge and capacity by which humankind
controls destructive natural forces and uses natural resources to
satisfy its needs, and, on the other, the regulation of human relations,
"especially the distribution of the available wealth." These material and
social economies are inseparable, since human relations "are profoundly
influenced by the amount of instinctual satisfaction which the existing
wealth makes possible" (<i>FI,</i> 3). Because social relations organize
both power and wealth, some individuals function as wealth for others
through labor or sexual attachment; thus Freud sees class oppression as
a threat to civilization's stability.

<p>

Freud considers this unconscious guilt--a hidden reservoir of
unacknowledged aggressive desire--"the most important problem in the
development of civilization" (<i>CD,</i> 81).

<i>ECP,</i> 295-6. Cf. Freud on how "the narcissism of minor differences"
(Spaniards v. Portuguese, North Germans v. South Germans, English
v. Scots, Christians v. Jews) makes "intelligible" the fact that
"the dream of a Germanic world-dominion called for antisemitism as
its complement" and that "the attempt to establish a new, communist
civilization in Russia should find its psychological support in the
persecution of the bourgeois. One only wonders, with concern, what the
Soviets will do after they have wiped out their bourgeois" (<i>CD,</i>

<i>MD,</i> 81. Miller ("RRD," 189-90) identifies the song
"<i>Allerseelen</i>" by Hermann von Gilm and Richard Strauss as the
source of the beggarwoman's age-old "fertilising" song ("<i>ee um
fah um so</i> / <i>foo swee too eem oo</i>"), which encompasses "the
pageant of the universe" and makes the earth seem "green and flowery,"
and which issues from a mouth that seems the archetype of all graves:
"a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted with root fibres and tangled
grasses, . . . soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages, and
skeletons and treasure, stream[ing] away in rivulets over the pavement
and all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards Euston, fertilising,
leaving a damp stain" (<i>MD,</i> 81). Woolf's draft translation breaks
off: "Lay by my side a bunch of purple heather / The last red aster of a"
(<i>H,</i> 98 and <i>passim</i>).

observation that no one can tell what women are like as long as sexual
and religious inhibitions of thought are inculcated from childhood;
certain affinities between his postwar works and Woolf's suggest that
he may have read her (<i>FI,</i> 79). Harry Trosman's partial catalogue

Devil" in which Woolf begs to be liberated from the home for female
lunatics at Twickenham, where her family has installed her to undergo
Dr. George Savage's version of S. Weir Mitchell's rest cure. She pays
ritual homage to Vanessa and ostentatiously displays good temper and
reasonableness while trying to get across that the rest cure is driving
her insane (<i>L,</i> 1:430-1, 28 July 1910). Woolf's letter to Gwen
Raverat about Septimus adds, "You can't think what a raging furnace it
still is to me--madness and doctors and being forced. But let's change
the subject" (<i>L,</i> 3:180, 1 May 1925).

In 1915 Woolf recorded seeing "a long line of imbeciles," "every
one . . . a miserable ineffective shuffling idiotic creature, with
no forehead, or no chin, &amp; an imbecile grin, or a wild suspicious
stare"; her response, "It was perfectly horrible. They should certainly
be killed," suggests disavowal of a suicidal self that she identifies
with them, echoed in Septimus's self-mirroring memory of "a maimed file
of lunatics" who "ambled and nodded and grinned past him. . . . And
would <i>he</i> go mad?" (<i>D,</i> 1:13, 9 January 1915; <i>MD,</i> 90).

Fresh wounds break open older wounds. One of the most estranging images
recorded by soldiers on the western front was that of cemeteries
in which heavy bombardment had unburied the dead. If historians and
literary critics in the late twentieth century turned to World War I
to focus on representations of what the British called shell shock,
they did so in order to find ways to deal with the legacy of World War
II. This midcentury trauma silenced the generation that survived its
combats and camps, and it left what Nicholas Abraham calls a concealed,
"phantom" injury to be mourned by the children of camp survivors.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  The return to 1914 was an indirect path taken toward understanding the
  present. Attempts to understand how the Holocaust and the Vietnam War
  had rendered narrative problematic, if not impossible, sent scholars
  back to consider how a similar breakdown of language and storytelling
  arose from World War I. As Walter Benjamin had written in "The
  Storyteller," "With the World War a process began to become apparent
  which has not halted since then. Was it not noticeable at the end of
  the war that men returned from battlefield grown silent--not richer

<b></b>

but poorer in communicable experience?"
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  In recent years, historians' conferences and journal issues dedicated
  to the epidemic of nervous breakdown or "combat fatigue" suffered
  in 1914-18 have focused on those "silent" men, reexamining medical
  and autobiographical accounts that help us understand the kinds of
  meanings allotted to trauma and its symptoms by doctors, military
  leaders, and politicians as well as by the soldiers themselves.

<p>
Modern interpreters have brought to this task the psychiatric definition
of post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD) that emerged from our experiences
in Vietnam. This diagnosis has enabled us to frame the forms that shell
shock took and to inquire why they became so central to the earlier
war narratives that have often been identified with modernism. PTSD
has offered literary critics a vocabulary to describe the symptoms
of soldiers' mental disturbances that may re in memoirs and other
autobiographical accounts: nonsequential memory, flashbacks, nightmares,
and mutism or fragmented language. Those symptoms bear a suggestive
resemblance to certain features of modernist experiment: decentering
of the subject, montage, ellipses or gaps in narrative, and startlingly
vivid images. This similarity--or, some would argue, connection--between
a set of medical symptoms among veterans and a set of stylistic features
in narrative has fostered a masculine canon of modernism.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
Behind these moving accounts of combatants' psychological injuries lies
concealed another history of wartime trauma, one that has only begun
to be written. "One train may conceal another," runs a French aphorism,
and the shock experienced by combatants during the war for a long time
displaced our attention from noncombatant traumas. Margaret Darrow has
argued that French women disappeared from the cultural memory of World War
I not because of "memory-loss" but because the story was never created:
"a failure of memory creation."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  As descriptions of a disturbing gap in the historical narrative,
  both phrases suggest trauma, perhaps because women's experiences
  so dramatically broke with accepted scripts, shocking many
  contemporaries. Restoring this repressed narrative requires us to
  bring social history together with feminist history. To do so, Darrow
  and other historians have turned to the experiences of civilians,
  such as those in occupied zones or in cities under bombardment,
  and to the experiences of the noncombatant medical corps, which of
  course included women. Over the last two decades, a focus on original
  sources has led to the publication or reedition of civilian and
  nursing diaries and memoirs, and historians have begun to study the
  social and economic impact of the war on civilians. We are starting
  to uncover an alternate history of World War I traumas.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
I begin here by reconsidering how war-induced trauma has been gendered
through its identification with combat, not only by those who lived
through 1914-18, but by scholars today. For alternative evidence,
I examine the traumatic stress suffered by members of a specific
noncombatant group--nurses and orderlies--who recorded repeated
confrontation with men's mutilated bodies. I focus on this group for
several reasons: their work in clearing stations, hospital ships, and
other emergency units took place under conditions similar to those faced
by combatants. The group includes women, which is important to me as I
consider what it means to construct a gendered canon or

<b></b>

countercanon. In addition, this group has produced writing that
ranges from immediate diaries and letters to retrospective memoirs and
fictionalized autobiographies. This range permits us to reflect on the
consequences of genre distinctions in relation to testimony and the
implied values that govern canon formation.

<p>
In the process, I want to underscore the problematic nature of trauma
narratives. These were understood by some doctors and psychiatrists
during the war as lies or fictions generated by malingerers. Other
specialists have understood trauma narratives as authentically symptomatic
testimony to the unspeakable conditions that precipitated psychological
breakdown. Dori Laub goes so far as to declare that "massive trauma
precludes its registration."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  For Laub, the gaps in narrative, like black holes, expand to consume
  all narrative, resulting in mutism. More recently, historians such
  as Eric Leed, George Mosse, and Jay Winter have viewed shell shock as
  a useful metaphor for the costs of modernity that were made manifest
  in industrialized warfare.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
The lability of the terminology for PTSD and accordingly of its
definitions in 1914-18--from shell shock to male hysteria, from
hypochondria to combat fatigue--points to the complexity of the
concept. This essay will explore some of the difficulties faced by
modern critics caught between the claims of authenticity and of art in
examining trauma writing. To what extent should the canon of war writings
be revised in light of the evidence that experimental techniques offered
a repertoire upon which soldiers and other witnesses of the war could
draw to compose their memories?
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  These are questions that have been raised by major critics such as
  Paul Fussell and Sam Hynes, but that continue to perplex our versions
  of literary history.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
Despite a professional literature that already in 1914-18 referred to
civilian experiences of wartime trauma, both historians and critics have
focused almost exclusively on combatants' experiences. Benjamin remarks
on the silence of "men returned from battlefield."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  In a recent Franco-British collection of essays on shell shock,
  all but one article deal with combatants.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  War is man's affair, in popular wisdom, and soldiers' sufferings
  lie at the heart of the matter. It is no surprise, then, to find
  that accounts of "soldiers' heart" (as one post-traumatic syndrome
  was called) dominate the scholarly reassessment of this period. When
  alternate voices have been sought out, they have been the voices of
  the foot soldiers, i.e. the working classes, in counterpoint to the
  eloquent poetic legacy of the elites.

<p>
Questions of masculinity have been fused with war trauma in curiously
ambiguous ways. PTSD was understood by the military as a failure
of masculinity--a failure of hardness, courage, or willpower--and
a manifestation of latent effeminacy or immaturity. It was thought
to be cured by violent electric shock, and was sometimes punished by
execution. Mosse and others have gathered evidence that (especially among
German doctors) victims of "male hysteria" were perceived as inferior
specimens and malingerers, thus aligning "shockers" with women, Jews,
and the working classes.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  For many scholars, including feminist critics, the focus has been on a
  "crisis of masculinity," as Elaine Showalter puts it.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  In her influential view, the medical discussion and the afflicted
  soldiers themselves expressed "more general but intense anxieties
  about masculinity, fears of acting effeminate, even a refusal to
  continue the bluff of

<b></b>

male behavior" (<i>FM</i>, 172). She gives the eruption of this anxiety
a particular twist. Since it was "manly" not to complain, "shell shock
was the body language of masculine complaint, a disguised male protest,
not only against the war, but against the concept of 'manliness' itself"
(ibid.).

<p>
Equally ambiguous is the powerful force of male bonding in wartime. Just
as trauma and disillusionment have become symbolic equivalents in the
way historians have thought about the ruptures wrought by the war, so
too trauma and the experience of brotherhood have become intertwined in
medical analyses and literary texts. On the positive side, comradeship
has been tied to a reduced incidence of shell shock. Denis Winter cites
letters in support of his thesis that "the chief prop was mates."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Doctors and commanders speculated whether neurasthenia or "male
  hysteria" as well as breaks in discipline could be prevented by
  developing an "esprit de corps."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  Comradeship sustained soldiers, protecting the unit against trauma, as
  we read in so many war narratives. Yet its intensity, when individual
  members of the unit were lost, could also trigger melancholia. Doctor
  after doctor remarked that the devastating "sight of dead comrades"
  or "the sight and sound of his lacerated comrades" was sufficient to
  arouse morbid agitation, nervous breakdown, with paralysis, cramps,
  or even delirium.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The bonds developed in trench warfare, it was thought, helped to
  explain the breakdown of those who had witnessed the fragmentation
  of bodies under protracted bombardment.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  It was a male form of mourning. By the end of the war, therefore,
  trauma had joined brotherhood and disillusionment as hallmarks of
  the war experience and of the war narrative. In spite of underlying
  ambiguities, the gendering of war entailed a gendering of trauma,
  and trauma became a privileged, masculine form of testimony about
  the complex meaning of war, a status it retains among historians and
  critics today.

<p>
I propose to interrogate the view of war trauma as a male disease by
inspecting wartime trauma experienced by noncombatants. The sufferings
of the noncombatant have already attracted interest from some major
historians and literary critics. Annette Becker's historiographically
innovative contribution, <i>Oubli&eacute;s</i> , for example,
compares the occupied territories of northern France to a large
internment camp, a militarized home front. She draws a parallel between
the traumatized victims of the occupation (a high percentage of whom
were women, children, and old men) and those long-term prisoners who
suffered from "barbed wire neuroses."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  Trudi Tate also juxtaposes men's and women's experiences in her
  study of modernism and World War I, devoting a chapter to civilian
  war neuroses on the home front. She cites examples such as a
  woman hospitalized when five of her seven sons were wounded, and
  devotes attention to fictional representations of secondary trauma
  ("shock <i>even to people who are not present</i>"), such as Rebecca
  West's <i>The Return of the Soldier</i> , Rose Macaulay's
  <i>Non-combatants and Others</i> , and H. D.'s narratives
  "Kora and Ka"  and <i>Bid Me to Live</i> .
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  Tate asks key questions that shape any study of war trauma: "who has
  seen what," how is one "positioned in relation to war's trauma," and
  "who has the right to speak" (<i>MH,</i> 19).

<p>
These studies of direct trauma on the home front and of the melancholia
that ensues from personal war losses are extremely valuable. What I
propose, however, is to

<b></b>

apply Tate's questions to those occupying a liminal position in relation
to war's trauma: noncombatant medical staff (both male and female) in
first-aid stations, clearing stations, and mobile units near the front. My
evidence shows that these workers not only dealt with soldiers' physical
and psychological traumas, but were themselves exposed to situations
that triggered breakdowns similar to those experienced by combatants.

<p>
To be sure, the etiology of shell shock is still debated. Some hold
that eventually, under corrosive conditions such as defeat, exhaustion,
constant bombardment, and immobilization, increasing rates of breakdown
or "combat fatigue" will be inevitable in any war. In the words of Lord
Moran, "men wear out in battle like their clothes."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  Norman Fenton thought that "in all probability, liability to neurotic
  symptoms is practically universal."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  The conditions to which many doctors in 1914-18 as well as modern
  psychiatrists have pointed are extreme fatigue, the continuous
  confrontation with death and mutilated bodies, the shock of surprise
  (a sudden horrifying sight), and an unresolvable conflict between
  fear and duty or between two equally compelling responsibilities.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  Thus W. H. R. Rivers, the doctor who treated Wilfred Owen and
  Siegfried Sassoon, recognized the power of forced immobility, a
  sense of powerlessness, and repression to foster war neuroses. Rivers
  notes that while camaraderie may help release disabling anxieties,
  the catalyst--"some disgusting sight or the death and mutilation of
  a friend"--may be overwhelming.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
Like combatants, medical staff worked under unrelenting strain for days on
end in confining quarters such as bunkers or dugouts and small operating
sheds. They handled steady streams of mutilated bodies. And they were torn
between their duty to the individual patients and their obligations to
send as many able-bodied soldiers as possible back to the front lines. The
situation of medical staff engaged in triage replicated in another
register the untenable moral conflicts that seemed to doctors to be
responsible for nervous breakdowns among officers. Yet surprisingly little
work has been done on the records concerning medical staff. Certainly
the term <i>shell shock</i>, its alliterative onomatopoeia so effective
in evoking a semblance of physical injury, seems inappropriate for a
discussion of the mental trauma experienced by medical staff.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  Perhaps the terminology itself impeded this insight. Significantly,
  however, Fenton, an American doctor who reviewed the official
  statistics about war neurosis after service with the American
  Expeditionary Force in France, identified a heightened incidence
  of breakdown among the medical corps. "[T]he greater proportion,"
  he wrote, "might be explained by the fact that these individuals
  witnessed terrible sights of mutilation and disease both at the front
  and in hospitals behind the lines" (<i>SSA</i>, 46). In what follows
  I review attempts by nurses and orderlies to record these aspects
  of their work, and explore the apparent impact of these traumatizing
  factors on some of their memoirs and sketches.

<p>
Many nurses themselves were fully aware of their oppressive
situation. Thus L&eacute;onie Godfroy explained her dark vision of the
war in her memoir:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
War appears to be something abominable or something sublime, depending
upon the side one encounters. <i>I must declare that I have seen only
the somber side. This is women's</i>

<b></b>

<i>share.</i> Those of us whom chance or vocation draws into the vast
drama must resign ourselves to seeing only the saddest of realities. To
men in the first rank of danger go the superb <i>&eacute;lan</i>,
the epic spectacles of the battlefield. To us, the other side of the
decor. . . . They come to us <i>afterwards</i>, bloody, weary, mute. It is
not surprising that our recollections often have an element of nightmare.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Ellen La Motte, a nurse on the western front who knew the former medical
student Gertrude Stein from their days in Baltimore, chose likewise to
describe "the backwash of war."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
The nightmares to which Godfroy refers are not just the violent dreams of
the damaged men who came to be treated, nor are they simply metaphors for
the horrors of industrialized warfare that have so often been invoked by
modern critics. Medical staff directly experienced the unrelieved stress
of industrialized war through the mechanized treatment of injuries--for
example, the constant irrigation of wounds and the mass production
techniques in surgery wards that divided patients according to their
injuries. The nightmares that erupted into Sassoon's consciousness also
erupt in nursing accounts. Nurse M. Eydoux-D&eacute;mians in a notebook
published in 1915 asks, "Was this horrible nightmare a reality?"
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Emotional and physical collapse resulted from the unrelenting press
of work endured by nurses. In Italy, Sita Meyer Camperio, who founded
the nursing corps, questioned her own stamina. In a diary entry of 18
May 1917, she describes how her physical exhaustion was exacerbated by
mental fatigue: "I do not know if I will have the moral and physical
force to remain long in this infernal mob, not being able to close my
eyes at night and having days filled with more tragic visions."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  An entry for the following day recounts how a fellow nurse came
  to her one night and threw her arms around her lamenting, "Sita,
  I cannot close my eyes any more!"
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  As Beth Tarini writes in an unpublished study of the Italian Red Cross,
  "Trauma eroded the strength to deal with trauma, and nurses found
  themselves caring for other nurses."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>

<p>
Lady Kennard, working in Romania in 1916, recorded in her diary an
afternoon bombardment, followed by the press of work in her hospital:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
as we neared the hospital shrapnel began to fall. The bombs, of course,
fell all round. I picked up one man wounded and unconscious and took him
on with me in the car. A woman was killed at the gate of the hospital
and one man died on the doorstep. . . . [T]hree operations between four
and seven.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As further wounded flooded in, operations continued while she stood for
six and a half hours, administering chloroform. "One couldn't be excited
in the hospital, there was no time. . . . One just works without the
faintest understanding of what one is doing. After it was all over we
collapsed . . . and drank hot tea . . . and tried to recover" (<i>RD,</i>
56-9). Kennard's ellipses punctuate the page like controlled pauses for
breath that help to reestablish the rhythms of human life and prevent
collapse. For some nurses, such breaks ultimately marked the point at
which they themselves fell silent. Thus the diary of Mme. de la Boulaye
stops short with the entry of 24 May 1917. A blank marked

<b></b>

by ellipses records her breakdown. Only in January 1919, when she wrote
her last framing pages to sum up the intervening months of collapse
followed by a resumption of nursing, does she describe the "three hard
months of illness [that] nailed me in my bed."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  Across the gap of no-man's-land, a comparable staccato observation is
  made by a German nurse, Schwester Elfriede Schulz, who in 1917 was
  working nonstop in surgery. She records that "The floor was piled
  high with bandages, amputated limbs, blood, bits of flesh, the air
  was filled with narcotics, pus, the reek of blood," and describes
  "shattered limbs that hung from a few scraps of flesh, bad head wounds,
  hopeless stomach wounds--it was beyond consolation."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  The days of 21-2 September she worked thirty hours, going from
  bandaging to operating to night watch. "You get frightfully tired,"
  she wrote. "While you are harassed in the operating room, it's all
  right, but in your free minutes you collapse."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  Some nurses turned to morphine, not only a painkiller but the agent
  of a euphoria that enabled them to continue to work.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
The crush of patients overwhelmed facilities and induced a sense
of helplessness among many nurses and orderlies. Nurse A. L. Walker
recalled handling three thousand men in a day at her base hospital:
"Operations went on unceasingly. As fast as a patient could be taken off
the operating table another went on, and so on all night, the surgeons
had been at it all day."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  The pace inhibited thought and suppressed a sense of self: "The work
  would have seemed hopeless, if one had stopped to think. . . . Some had
  both legs off, some their side blown away, all were wounded in dozens
  of places. Doctors and nurses were hopelessly outnumbered, distractedly
  trying to meet the demands made on them" (ibid.). Ironically,
  the relentless routines of rapid-fire work sustained the flow of
  adrenalin, even while exhausting emotional reserves. Another British
  nurse writes of "the nervous strain and the hopelessness of struggling
  against heavy odds."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  Her inability to relieve suffering adequately, she wrote home,
  "tries me so dreadfully" (ibid.).

<p>
Similarly, Mary Britnieva, a young Russian nurse of British extraction,
was overwhelmed when she came upon victims of gas attack laid out for
emergency treatment on a field:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The ghastliness of what we saw is beyond description, the memory of it
making me shudder to this day. They lay on their backs mostly, their
upturned faces terribly swollen and livid--some almost blue--choking
and coughing, their bloodshot eyes protruding, unable to utter a word,
yet fully conscious, only their eyes and their occasional spasmodic feeble
movements proclaiming the supreme agony that they were enduring. Some were
evencoughing up pieces of their lungs that the cruel gas had disintegrated
in their living bodies.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The memory of these men whose very coughs tore them apart returns
physically to punctuate--with vivid details such as the color
blue--Britnieva's memoir. She insists on the despair she and her
colleagues felt when faced with such cases, men whom they had known: "We
felt utterly helpless, there was no remedy, we were powerless. . . . The
realization of our helplessness was almost unbearable; a wound can
be dressed and the flow of blood from a haemorrhage can be stanched,
but this fiendish weapon had got science and surgery beaten" (ibid.,
ellipses in original).

<b></b>

<p>
Triage imposed upon doctors and nurses the sacrilegious responsibility
of determining who should live and who should be allowed to die. While
it in fact raised survival rates, triage came at a cost to those who
performed it. Anna Cameron commented, "The lives of living men must not
be risked for lives going out, but the memory of some things which have
had to be often left undone in the stress of war nursing stabs and stabs
in the quiet days."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Lucia Garelli, an Italian nurse who fell ill and died, wrote in a
  letter of August 1917, "How I have fought and how my poor, ugly face
  bears deep signs of the internal violence, of my strained will, of
  the lashes to the tired body. Whoever has not been with me and does
  not know me well cannot comprehend the t in which I am engaged
  day after day between feelings and nerves, between heart and head."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>

<p>
The despair accompanying impossible responsibility, especially the
conflict between competing ethical and patriotic responsibilities, forms
a leitmotif in some of the boldest accounts of nursing trauma. Madeleine
Clemenceau Jacquemaire, daughter of the French politician, closes her
fictionalized autobiographical account of service in the Red Cross with
an anguished intrusive vision of recurrent horror. Her counterpart, the
head nurse Madame Berton, meditates on the long-term responsibility of
women to tell the truth of the war to future generations:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The wheel will continue to turn yet longer. We are at the point in the
circle where the wounded man arrives from the battlefield, whence he
will pass on (if he does not die and is not mutilated) to the interior,
to convalescence, the base station, the trench, and then led by fate
back to us, if he is not killed. We often see men who have been wounded
five and six times. Ah! away, away! the awful vision that oppresses me
. . . Those Spanish horses, sunk to the ground in their blood . . . The
ring assistant comes close, thrusts the entrails spilling from the open
flank back inside with a handful of straw! Ah! the poor animals! He
forces them up with a pitchfork, to bring them back to the bull whose
rage must be exhausted. . . . Are we doing the same thing? Yes, since
we must buy victory.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The vision intrudes and punctuates her thoughts. The effectiveness
of her ellipses lies in their visual evocation of what she wishes to
repress. The macabre, insistent hallucination expresses the nurse's
fear that war instrumentally reduces men to damaged bodies and to
commodities exchanged for victory. Those who bandage them contribute to
the perpetuation of the system.

<p>
One of the most important factors in trauma for medical staff was the
disarticulation of bodies and the uncanny blurring of boundaries between
the human and the inanimate, the living and the dead. Lady Kennard
reports her violent illness and the "mute misery" of her pain after
witnessing an accident in which a train from Bucarest, overladen with
destitute refugees, women and children, derailed:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Last night we visited at sunset such a scene of horror as can never,
and should never, be described. . . . No one knows how many hundreds
died there by the roadside, some in the flames of the engine's exploded
petrol tank, the greater number crushed into one huge formless mass of
flesh and horse-hair, splintered bones and wood. [<i>RD,</i> 125-6]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
That which cannot be described must nonetheless be indicated. Even the
silence of her misery can speak only through the space opened up by
words. The insistence in trauma literature that experience lies beyond
language depends, ironically, on language.

<p>
The disassembly of bodies resulted not only from modern combat but
from surgery itself. "I have ceased to be affected by corpses," Lady
Kennard wrote, "but I hate amputations" (<i>RD</i>, 60). Amputations
held a particular power to dismay for Pierre La Mazi&egrave;re, a male
orderly on a hospital boat at the Dardanelles. He notes not only the
frantic pace of operations, but his "horror, terror, and revolt" at the
amputation of an arm.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  His eyes are transfixed by severed fingers, and he is shocked by the
  surprising shortness of an arm without its hand, a leg without its
  foot. La Mazi&egrave;re's reflections evoke the care with which he
  tried to distinguish and understand his own reactions:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
While I can observe impassively from the moment when the wounded man is
put to sleep and throughout the operation, whatever its horror; while
I can watch without emotion the lancet penetrate the flesh, the curette
digging into infected wounds, the gouge grinding bones, my sensibility
is provoked beyond measure as soon as I am confronted with some debris:
arm, leg, foot, or hand whose warmth immediately evaporates and which
so quickly assumes the waxy appearance of death.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The operation that detaches the dying from the living, the part from
the formerly harmonious whole, troubles him because it suggests the
complicity of medicine in the destruction of war. La Mazi&egrave;re
translates this experience of terror and revulsion into a hellish scene
in which he must carry a gangrenous limb for disposal in the furnace,
darting here and there in the underwater maze of corridors as he hurries
to dispose of this uncanny symbol of death.

<p>
The diaries and memoirs of nurses and orderlies such as La Mazi&egrave;re
and Kennard display a precise detail, a power of self-interrogation, and a
driving rhythm that make them as forceful as most fictional narratives. In
a similarly detailed account Lydiia Zakharova, a Russian middle-class
mother who volunteered as a nurse in 1916, describes no-man's-land
as a vast labyrinth. Its trenches overflow with masses of dead bodies
interspersed with strange objects--stolen china, a toppled child's high
chair--that bear mute witness to combat. Frozen bodies sit in poses
that make them seem alive, "eyes open and glazed with the tranquillity
of non-existence, as if they were listening to the ominous cries of the

<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  Like the surgical nurses Schulz and Walker, who are grateful that
  they have no time to think, Zakharova notes that at a certain limit
  "the human mind can perceive no more horrors, as a saturated sponge
  can soak up no more water" ("DRC," 185). When she suddenly finds
  herself separated from the orderlies, her disorientation exposes her
  situation in no-man's-land. Lost between life and death, she must
  walk over "some kind of mush," being unable to distinguish between
  mud and mute men ("DRC," 186). Eventually she traces a curve on the
  horizon that must be the Russian trenches, and her narrative resumes.

<p>
Of these assorted records, only the depiction of hospital life by
Jacquemaire--a first person account in which the author is transposed
as the third-person Mme. Berton--is overtly fictionalized. Many of them
interpolate sharply observed soldiers'

<b></b>

stories about moments of crisis or complex inner conflicts, subordinating
their own insights to dramatic accounts by men who seemed closer to
the front, perhaps to anchor their own accounts. In the past such
interpolations have been read as transparent documents, unconstructed
testimony, or sutured case histories (a genre that many of them
echo). Such interpolations, however, signal the constructed nature of
these texts, and remind us that the text of war is a hybrid whose site
of origin is always displaced.

<p>
The simple artistry of these medical diaries and memoirs, with their
startling details and fitful narrative rhythms, finds a more ambitious
equivalent in the novel <i>Balaurul</i> , based on the Romanian
novelist Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu's experience of nursing at Foscani. By
focusing an entire chapter on the exposed heart of a dying soldier
that she never permits us to see, Papadat-Bengescu invites the reader
to imagine indescribable events and to explore the psychic and social
wounds inflicted by war. The nurse Laura, through whom the experience is
focalized, interrupts her thoughts with ellipses, punctuating physical
description with questions about the soldier's unknowable emotion and
mind: "Then she knew. He . . . he was afraid . . . afraid to move, to
blink even, over the frozen pupil . . . afraid? And he kept his head
like that, pushed back, not to see . . . To see what? . . . Maybe he
had already seen . . ."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  Her own thoughts interrupt each other, just as her intent focus on
  the symbolic wound interrupts her routine nursing tasks and breaks
  down the frame of understanding into which she attempts to place that
  naked organ or "altar" of human life. We cannot be surprised to learn
  that this novel was initially rejected by readers. Papadat-Bengescu
  finds shocking and sacrilegious images for the diseases she observes,
  describing gangrenes and strange new epidemics of "infectious pustules
  linking disparate cases" as "a flora specific to modern wars" ("MWH,"
  362). Her irony about the tawdry emotions unleashed by suffering
  must have been unacceptable in the postwar period. She describes the
  ingenuity that united climates, organisms, and nations in developing
  new formulae for destruction as "procedures which industrious and
  honest scientists were still offering with innocence and praise to
  the vampire of war" (ibid.). The diagnostic gaze is trained not only
  on the body but on the society as well.

<p>
Aside from Vera Brittain's memoir, the World War I nursing sketches that
are best known today are undoubtedly those of Ellen La Motte, a trained
nurse, and of Mary Borden, a wealthy younger writer who volunteered at
the outset of the war. Both worked in the same French military hospital
on the western front, which Borden herself had funded. Both moved in
avant-garde circles, apparently having met through their friendship
with Gertrude Stein; Borden had had an affair with Wyndham Lewis and
became a novelist after the war, while La Motte published sketches about
her subsequent experiences in China combatting the opium trade. Their
accounts differ from most of the previous examples because they not only
record immediate observations, but also display a self-conscious concern
for artistic craft, deliberately fragmenting their texts. Their work is
so powerful that one reviewer found it might suggest the hospital was
"a place of horror."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
  Indeed.

<p>
Are their works memoirs or fictions? Authentic witness or artistic
exploitation? Ernest Hemingway (himself in the ambulance corps) assumed
that women's lack of "war experience"

<b></b>

forced them to borrow their evidence from men who had the experience.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  In its review of Borden, the <i>Saturday Review of Literature</i>
  worried about her poetic gifts: "Miss Borden has taken the rawest
  materials of life and turned them into a work of art. But what
  price art?"
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  Such a question loses its sharp contours today, when autobiographies
  have come to be understood as literary productions, and histories
  as emplotments. Yet for many critics and analysts, trauma writing
  has retained a privileged status as a form of virtually spontaneous
  truth telling. I have argued elsewhere that fragmentation, abrupt
  juxtaposition, deadpan description, and intrusively vivid images in
  La Motte's <i>Backwash of War</i>  and Borden's <i>Forbidden
  Zone</i>  constitute what I have termed a kind of deliberate
  "symptomatic writing" of the trauma of nursing.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  It is important, however, not to confuse such a symptomatic writing
  with "unwitting" or "unconscious testimony" (<i>TCW,</i> 15).

<p>
If we think of the writing of trauma as a process of birth, in which,
as Laub suggests, the emergence of narrative produces "knowing," then
the imperative relationship between the teller and the imagined audience
becomes salient. Psychoanalytic study has focused on the need to testify
"to an absence, to an event that has not yet come into existence" because
the violence and enormity of the traumatic event cannot be assimilated
(<i>TCW,</i> 57). Just as the event seems incomprehensible, suspended
between a before and an after, the story of trauma is suspended between
life and death. As Cathy Caruth suggests, it exists "between the story
of the unbearable nature of an event and the story of the unbearable
nature of its survival."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  Trauma theory is torn between the hope offered by the "talking cure,"
  in which a listener enables the speaker, and the more pessimistic
  premise that, as Benjamin puts it, "In all mourning there is the
  deepest inclination to speechlessness."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
  Much medical work, as these quotations suggest, has focused on
  knowledge at the site of generation rather than that of reception.

<p>
I propose that we look closely at the kind of "knowing" that is at stake
in these texts. We must consider the relationship between an obstructed,
specific consciousness of violence in its ungraspable details and a more
philosophic knowledge about the causes and consequences of violence. This
second knowing is impelled by a desire to restore the self and to change
one's audience; it can motivate and enable the telling by which the
dark and obstructed first kind of knowing becomes possible. The two
kinds of consciousness cannot be separated, but there is a movement
from one to the other in the most creative and powerful of these World
War I narratives. Borden, La Motte, Papadat-Bengescu, and even less
self-conscious writers such as La Mazi&egrave;re draw from a bitter well,
then pass their knowledge on to their readers.

<p>
The first kind of knowledge about war trauma, often symbolized by
a confrontation with death that civilians can never understand,
has generally been understood as incompatible with the second, more
philosophic knowledge. When the critical measure of authenticity excludes
noncombatants, and looks askance at artistry, it excludes consideration
of works such as those I describe here. Sam Hynes chooses, like Tolstoy,
to privilege the way soldiers "bear witness" to modern war: "I too have
taken the actual killing to be the center of war's compound story."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  He therefore concentrates on the simple, accurate accounts of soldiers
  that have "the authority of direct experience."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<b></b>

Such an exclusion may be contested by adducing the evidence of war trauma
through the presence of its symptoms. Yet if we interpret war memoirs
and autobiographical fictions symptomatically, as I myself have done,
we run the risk of a circular logic. The symptoms do not guarantee the
authenticity of the unique lived experience, since they participate
in a larger, preexisting system of signs, and deploy those that are
available both to invoke and to evade the trauma. As Robert Graves wrote,
"the memoirs of a man who went through some of the worst experiences of
trench warfare are not truthful if they do not contain a high proportion
of falsities."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

<p>
The interconnection between the symptoms of trauma and a widespread
explanation of the rise of modernism gives this question special
weight. Susan Stanford Friedman writes in her study of H. D. that "Art
produced after the First World War recorded the emotional aspect of
this crisis; despair, hopelessness, paralysis, angst, and a sense of
meaninglessness, . . . chaos, and fragmentation of material reality."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  Modernist writing, she explains, focused on the "agency of language"
  as a vehicle of meaning (ibid.). For some, trauma writing was defined
  by a fragmentary juxtaposition of intense moments and images,
  as emotionally powerful wording erupted in response to the war
  experience. It stood in opposition to the exhausted, clich&eacute;
  discourse of patriotism and traditional values that Henry James and
  Hemingway declined as overstrained and obscene.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  As Edith Wharton wrote, "the meaning had evaporated out of lots of
  our old words, as if the general smash-up had broken their stoppers."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
Already during the war the verbal symptoms of trauma experienced by
soldiers had been linked to the experimental forms of modernist or
avant-garde writing. The power of wartime trauma to filter into literary
forms is testified to by Andr&eacute; Breton, who served as an orderly
in the psychiatric service at Saint-Dizier and in Paris at the Val de
Grace hospital. Annette Becker comments, "If the Great War was not the
creator of the surrealist movement, it was certainly its catalyst."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  Charged with distinguishing simulators from those genuinely ill,
  Breton transcribed the ravings of his mental patients when he was on
  night duty. The dreams and free associations that burst out in these
  instances of acute delirium "were from the beginning at the heart
  of surrealism."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
  Importantly, Breton was consciously exploiting such forms of
  expression, in order to explore the possibility of "freedom from
  logical, moral, and other constraints" (ibid.).

<p>
Probably the most convincing argument for modernist features in
nursing war narratives can be found in Jane Marcus's comments on
Evadne Price's fictional diary of an ambulance driver, <i>Not So Quiet
. . . Stepdaughters of War.</i> She compares the narrative voice in
<i>Not So Quiet</i> to that of Stein, connecting the "explosive" sentence
structures, ellipses, and hallucinatory outbursts to modernist montage.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  Marcus borrows the metaphors of war to evoke this "brutally
  masculinized prose" in Price's work as a "bombardment" of the reader
  "in a text pock-marked with ellipses of silence and rushes of noisy
  belligerent words."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
  Calling attention to the "disorder and disorientation of the body
  at war," Marcus suggests that self-interruptive ellipses evoke
  the physical experience of war trauma and "gender trauma" ("CCC,"
  268-9). Indicative of repressed rage, these gaps comment on the lack
  of truthful communication in war, so that sentences become "fragmented
  like the bodies that litter this forbidden territory" ("CCC," 273).

<b></b>

<p>
Price, a popular novelist writing under a pseudonym, returns us to the
question of authenticity. Price was commissioned to compose a response
to Erich Maria Remarque's <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>
. Marcus has tracked the echoes exhaustively. Perhaps more
interesting are less overtly commercial enterprises. Lesley N. Smith's
<i>Four Years Out of Life</i>  reads like a parody of Mary Borden's
<i>Forbidden Zone,</i> published two years earlier. Imitation is the
highest form of flattery, one might say. The larger point is that such
writers were drawing, ten and more years after the end of the war, on
an established repertoire of forms for describing the war. Claire Tylee
has described Rebecca West's anonymous <i>War Nurse--The True Story of
a Woman Who Lived, Loved and Suffered on the Western Front</i> 
as a flagrant fiction that combined stock war motifs with gothic romance.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  To be sure, it is not necessary in such a case to postulate a
  preexisting expressive repertoire for traumatic expression, since
  some writers, like politicians, seem to be able to invent a language
  of clich&eacute;s. In general, however, even the major early war
  texts, such as Henri Barbusse's <i>Le feu, journal d'un escadron</i>
  , were shaped by an available discourse, both traditional and
  experimental, as Paul Fussell has demonstrated in his study of British
  war literature, <i>The Great War and Modern Memory</i> .

<p>
Questions about authenticity still arise in part because we have not
yet integrated the concept of intertextuality into our understanding
of trauma literature. Oddly enough, doctors observed that the forms
of expression taken by trauma might occur in small epidemics. Fenton
accompanied a train of "war neurotics" on which one man had a stutter:
"when they detrained the next day almost all of them stuttered."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
  He did not mean that his patients were simulators, although the fact
  that hypochondriacs could be mistaken for hysterics implied that the
  signifying systems of trauma were available to others. Rather, he
  suggested, social codes helped shape the course of mental disabilities
  and channeled their expression.

<p>
Understanding the symptoms of neurosis as socially encoded took its most
striking form in the class distinction British doctors drew between
the forms that war neuroses took among officers and among "men." One
consequence was a distrust of some symptoms as fictions. Similarly,
German doctors suspected that war neuroses were really a covert display
of the lazy working class desire for a pension (<i>Rentenneurosen</i>).
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>

<p>
Conversely, it has seemed to some modern interpreters that secondary
or imagined trauma, the aftershock felt by those who were not direct
witnesses, does not substantially differ from lived trauma: the two then
would be equal in weight. Tate goes so far as to claim in her commentary
on H. D. that "fantasy might be constituted differently from the memory
of real events, but it can be equally disturbing" (<i>MH,</i> 16). These
issues of interpretation and attitudes toward fictionality are not idle:
the difference could sometimes result in execution.

<p>
In <i>Testimony,</i> Felman and Laub ask, what is "the relation between
narrative and history, between art and memory, between speech and
survival?"
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  The difficult relationships among these pairings speak to the complex,
  unstable, and value-laden concept of a massive trauma such as that
  experienced during World War I. The instability or, as some would
  have it, inexpressible nature of trauma is in large part responsible

<b></b>

for the problematic status of war narratives. Examining the testimony of
medical staff is useful because these texts both observe and participate
in the experiences of trauma. When their styles display the symptoms
of trauma, the effect is both descriptive and expressive. As a result,
they participate in the two kinds of knowing considered here. I would
reject any polarity between authenticity and artifice--an opposition that
(in the context of war literature) has been aligned with the opposition
between combatant and noncombatant, between male and female. The evidence
from nursing accounts indicates, I hope, that the distance between an
"authentic" soldier's account and a noncombatant nurse's account is less
great than many have supposed. In addition, I want to bear tribute to
the artistry that even simple testimony can possess. That artistry is
essential to the healing and constructive role of narration at a time
when trauma and memory shape the modern subject.

<p>
In Oscar Wilde's <i>Lady Windermere's Fan,</i> Cecil Graham insists,
"I never talk scandal. <i>I</i> only talk gossip." When asked what
the difference is between the two, Cecil replies, "Oh! Gossip is
charming! History is merely gossip. But scandal is gossip made tedious
by morality."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  Wilde would most likely have agreed that media publicity often
  accompanies--indeed, amplifies--the tedium of morality as a defining
  property of scandal. The scandal I want to consider, perhaps the
  most sensational scandal in Britain during World War I, suitably
  began with an announcement for a play by Wilde that appeared in the
  <i>Sunday Times</i> newspaper in February 1918:



<blockquote>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<!--_extract-->
OSCAR WILDE'S SALOME
<br />
MAUD ALLAN in private performances by
<br />
J. T. GREIN's INDEPENDENT THEATRE,
<br />
April next.
<br />
Terms of membership from Miss Valetta, 9, Duke Street.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This unassuming notice accompanies other advertisements that evoke
Britain's charged cultural atmosphere as it entered its fourth year of
war. In the paper's "Social and Personal" section, several personal
detectives advertise their services for managing the contemporary
misfortunes of "Blackmail, Divorce, Libel or anonymous letters" and for
assisting "if you require relief from an embarrassing entanglement, or
any delicate matter." The paper also boasts an array of treatments for
such modern conditions as shell shock and war neurosis, with cures ranging
from hypnotic suggestion to "Hindu Treatment." In the entertainment

<b></b>

notices Madame Taussaud advertises a wax exhibition of "Celebrities
of the PAST and PRESENT and HEROES of the WAR." The advertisement for
Wilde's play, printed just above Madame Taussaud's announcement, would
become the first document in a remarkable legal event which the press
ultimately deemed "an unprecedented orgy of scandal and disorder."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Indeed, as the scandal over <i>Salom&eacute;</i> unfolded, it
  encompassed the peculiar realms invoked by the other advertisements:
  detected secrets, blackmail and libel, "delicate situations," the
  nervous disorders of war, hypnotic suggestion, the mysteries of the
  East, and celebrity exhibitions.

<p>
In addition to tedious morality and media publicity, a scandal also
requires colorful public personalities, a condition satisfied by the
above names. In 1918 the name "Oscar Wilde" was synonymous with infamy;
<i>Salom&eacute;,</i> written in 1891, was his only drama to be banned
from public performance in England, and its 1894 English publication
with Aubrey Beardsley's naughty illustrations kindled a minor literary
scandal of its own.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  Maud Allan was a dancer who had become one of London's most famous
  and eroticized performers a decade earlier with her scantily-clad
  and sexually suggestive modern dance, "The Vision of Salome" (<A
  NAME="1" href="9.1medd_res.html#1"> 1</a>). Meanwhile,
  her "intimate yet undefinable" relationship with Margot Asquith,
  who was rumoured to be a "sapphist," had provoked society gossip.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  J. T. Grein, the play's producer and the owner of the Independent
  Theatre, was a businessman and dramatic critic of the <i>Sunday
  Times.</i> Active in the production of modern and often controversial
  drama, Grein was the first to bring Henrik Ibsen and George Bernard
  Shaw to the London stage. In 1918, Wilde, <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> Allan,
  and Grein were all widely recognized, ideologically charged proper
  names, ripe for scandalous deployment.

<p>
Within less than a week of Grein's advertisement, the front page of a
small right wing radical newspaper called <i>The Vigilante</i> displayed
the following cryptic paragraph:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
The Cult of the Clitoris
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->To be a member of Maud Allan's performances in Oscar Wilde's Salome one
has to apply to a Miss Valetta, of 9, Duke Street. . . . If Scotland
Yard were to seize the list of these members I have no doubt they would
secure the names of several thousand of the first 47,000.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "Cult of the Clitoris" paragraph then launched the sort of enticing
narrative that a scandal requires and also made its publisher, Noel
Pemberton-Billing, a public sensation. In a few weeks, Allan, the play's
star, and Grein, its producer, began legal proceedings against Billing
on a charge of obscene and criminal libel.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
An independent member of Parliament, Billing led the Vigilante
Society, whose mission was to promote "purity" in public life. The
Society was particularly dedicated to rooting out that "'mysterious
influence'"--the invisible German presence spreading moral degeneracy in
England itself--"which was responsible," Billing claimed, "for all the
British failures in the war" (<i>SLV,</i> 3). The "47,000" mentioned in
the "Cult of the Clitoris" paragraph alluded to a previous article by
Billing that reported the discovery of a book belonging to "a certain
German Prince." This book allegedly compiled reports from "German agents
who have infested this country for the past twenty

<b></b>

years, agents so vile and spreading debauchery of such a lasciviousness
as only German minds could conceive and only German bodies execute"
(<i>VR,</i> 451). The book's "stupefying contents" provided instruction
on "the propagation of evils which all decent men thought had perished
in Sodom and Lesbia" and included more than a thousand pages "filled
with the names mentioned by German agents in their reports. These
are names of forty-seven thousand English men and women" (<i>VR,</i>
451-2). Billing's article detailed the methods this "black book of sin"
devised for "contaminating" the whole English population through the
"carefully cultivated introduction of practices which hint at the
extermination of the race" (<i>VR,</i> 452). Homosexuality, it seems,
was the enemy's secret genocidal weapon. Most threatening to the nation
at war was the successful queer invasion of "high politics." Billing
warned, "Wives of men in supreme position were entangled. In Lesbian
ecstasy the most sacred secrets of State were betrayed. The sexual
peculiarities of members of the Peerage were used as a leverage to
open fruitful fields for espionage" (ibid.). This book even provided a
"glossary" that listed "expressions supposed to be used among themselves
by the soul-sick victims of this nauseating disease so skilfully [sic]
spread by Potsdam" (ibid.). Under the subheading "The Fall of Rome,"
Billing closed his article with a call for action that exorbitantly
merged national, imperial, moral, sexual, and gender panic:





<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
all the horrors of shells and gas and pestilence introduced by the
Germans in their open warfare would have but a fraction of the effect
in exterminating the manhood of Britain as the plan by which they
have already destroyed the first forty-seven thousand. . . . [I]t is a
terrible thought to contemplate that the British Empire should fall as
fell the great Empire of Rome, and the victor now, as then, should be
the Hun. [<i>VR,</i> 453]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, "the forty-seven thousand" belonged to a cult of sexual
depravity susceptible to the influence, corruption, and exploitation
by German agents. Since "The Cult of the Clitoris" paragraph implicated
<i>Salom&eacute;</i> and Maud Allan in the 47,000, associating her with
sexual deviance and national sedition, Allan charged Billing with the
libel of insinuating that she, her performances, and her audience, were
"obscene and indecent," "lewd[,] unchaste and immoral," and "addicted to
obscene and unnatural practices" (<i>VR,</i> 472). That is, Allan accused
Billing of implying that she was a lesbian, and that her performance
in Wilde's play would promote sexual perversions among its vulnerable
wartime audience, thereby opening "fruitful fields for espionage."

<p>
After the initial proceedings at Bow Street Police Court, Billing was
committed to trial at the Old Bailey. Six days of sensational court
drama then captured the attention of the media, and moreover, captured
the popular imagination of a nation panicked, paranoid, and exhausted by
the war. Co-opting the courtroom as a space of hystericized spectacle,
slinging accusations and fomenting anxiety about the plot of the 47,000,
Billing was ultimately acquitted by a jury of his peers and cheered as
a hero by a mob of spectators, while press editorials scolded him for
exploiting the national atmosphere of war hysteria with his outrageous
allegations. Billing claimed the last word by compiling a <i>Verbatim
Report</i> of the court proceedings for private subscription.

"In Lesbian Ecstasy": Representing the War
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Wilde's trial and imprisonment in 1895 brought male homosexuality to the
headlines, but the Billing trial signals the first time the discussion
of <i>female</i> homosexuality obsessed the British popular press.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  Allan then may be read as a public icon of homosexual danger homologous
  to Wilde, and her failed libel suit against Billing uncannily echoes
  Wilde's own libel case against the Marquess of Queensberry that
  eventually led to his downfall. However, beyond mentioning the trial
  and Billing's outrageous accusations, social histories of homosexuality
  have provided little analysis of the relation between the trial, the
  cultural history of lesbianism, and the gender and sexual dynamics
  within the cultural history of Great War Britain.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
In the two books that deal exclusively with the trial, the question of
female sexuality is precluded either by discussions of Wilde or political
conspiracies. The title of Philip Hoare's recent book on the trial,
<i>Oscar Wilde's Last Stand</i> , indicates the study's primary
focus of analysis: for Hoare, the "cult" of Wilde and aestheticism were on
trial, imagined by Billing as the ultimate threat to the British nation
at war. Hoare construes Billing's attack on Wilde's play as a protest
against the decadent indulgences that were considered symptomatic of
the moral degeneracy and lassitude that put the British 

<b></b>

nation at risk of defeat by the Germans.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  In <i>Salome's Last Veil</i> , war historian Michael Kettle
  convincingly argues that Billing's trial was implicated in a political
  conspiracy of disgruntled British war generals who were trying to
  block alleged secret peace talks with the Germans and plotting to
  overthrow Lloyd George's coalition government.

<p>
While the trial <i>did</i> powerfully evoke the ghost of Wilde's condemned
sexuality and artistic practices and <i>was</i> deeply enmeshed in
the political exigencies of its historical moment, it also crucially
introduced the specter of female (homo)sexuality as a locus of national
anxiety. Indeed, it was the very conjunction of particular political,
literary, and sexual histories that provided the conditions of possibility
for such an intriguing utterance as "The Cult of the Clitoris" to come to
represent concerns over national security. Unprintable in news reports,
the libelous phrase was the open secret of the trial and the phrase upon
which Allan's prosecution and Billing's defense hinged.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Combining a seductive appeal to sexual fantasy with a whiff of
  farce, the phrase presented a hermeneutical enigma that recruited
  the suggestion of female homosexuality into the service of national
  wartime paranoia. Only recently have critics begun to consider the
  lesbian significance of the trial. Such work, however, has not had the
  benefit of the full trial documents and has been primarily interested
  in the trial's deployment of sexology.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  In focusing on the lesbian accusation in the trial, I want to consider
  how a wartime crisis of reading and representation conred national
  and social anxieties through the operation of lesbian fantasy. The
  paranoid fantasies that Billing circulated encompassed and exceeded
  the concerns of Wilde's 1895 trial so that a decadent memory was
  recalled in order to portend a modern, more frightening manifestation;
  familiar moral panics were updated with international conspiracy
  and lesbian terror. Because the suggestion of lesbianism aroused a
  cultural frisson but lesbianism itself lacked a legal definition,
  it provided a salient re of sexual fantasy through which the
  nation could simultaneously condense and disperse its unrepresentable
  anxieties about national health and security.

<p>
Cultural analyses of World War I tend to agree that when the war violently
imposed a radically different structure of national and psychical
experience, it demanded new forms to represent this altered condition.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  This challenge to modes of representation was aggravated by an
  epistemological destabilization. As the editors of <i>Women's
  Fiction and the Great War</i> contend, "No one knew what was going
  on throughout the Great War. Censorship, propaganda, and the sheer
  scale and complexity of the event made it impossible to grasp what
  was happening at any particular moment."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  The rise of the daily press had stimulated the public appetite for
  information, but state intervention into reportage during the war
  amounted to what Phillip Knightley calls a "sordid conspiracy to keep
  the truth from the people."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Under these circumstances, the British public became disillusioned
  with the press and increasingly skeptical about the integrity of the
  printed word.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  This wartime epistemological blackout was accompanied and exacerbated
  by a panic over spies "passing" in England and communicating in
  espionage codes, which raised the anxious hermeneutic question:
  how does one read or decipher identities--particularly dangerous and
  subversive ones--during a time of unprecedented uncertainty?



<p>
Jacqueline Rose argues in a more conceptual register that in war
"something about knowledge or the possibility of acquired and definitive
certainty is at stake."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  In <i>Why War?</i> she proposes that, "The familiar destructiveness of
  war represents not, as is commonly supposed, finality but uncertainty,
  a hovering on the edge of what, like death, can never be totally
  known."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Billing's plot appropriated the emerging notion of lesbianism as
  an imaginative form through which to re this epistemological
  and hermeneutic dilemma that was engendered by World War I. The
  very <i>suggestibility</i> of lesbianism, with its wide range of
  connotations and possible manifestations but without a singular
  consolidated popular image, rendered it a particularly powerful
  vehicle for ring the wartime problematic of uncertainty,
  illegibility, and (mis)representation. Not only are sexual secrets
  considered commensurate with national ones, but the wartime dilemma of
  unknowability and uncertainty finds an analogy in the highly suggestive
  but ultimately unknowable notion of female homosexuality. In other
  words, if male homosexuality functioned as a re of the "open
  secret" in the nineteenth century, as Eve Sedgwick has suggested,
  then in the early-twentieth century, lesbianism operated as a re
  of heightened suggestion and potential-but-always-foreclosed
  knowledge that enticed only to frustrate the possibility of
  disclosure or interpretation. What cannot be known or comprehended
  about the "reality" of the war is translated into a fantasy of the
  epistemologically elusive category of female homosexuality.

<p>
Why lesbianism? Just how unknown or unknowable was it? Certainly, female
homosexuality at this time admitted multiple genealogies. Literary
(and largely French) representations include the vampiric and decadent
"femmes damn&eacute;es" of Baudelaire, Swinburne, and Balzac; the
sapphic revivals of Natalie Barney, Ren&eacute;e Vivien, Michael Field,
and Pierre Lou&yuml;s; and the indiscriminate courtesan or sexual rake of
Zola's <i>Nana</i> and Gautier's <i>Mademoiselle de Maupin.</i> Medical
discourse taxonomized the female sexual invert, while sexual politics
aligned lesbianism with the self-exhibiting turn-of-the-century "public
woman," a term first applied to prostitutes soliciting on streetcorners
and actresses performing on stage that also came to include suffragists
protesting in the street and "the New Women" emerging in the public
sphere.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  Such res of female independence and homosociality, which were
  linked with anxieties about female homosexuality, became more
  pronounced during the gender disruption of World War I. In spite
  of this legacy (notably, a largely literary French one), explicitly
  scandalous female homosexuality has been considered by many sexual
  historians as having been essentially "unthinkable" to the British
  popular imagination emerging from Victoria's reign.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  In 1918 it is the very inconceivability of scandalous female
  homosexuality, at its precise historical point of shading
  into possibility, that constitutes it as the perfect re for
  staging the sexualized "Other scene" of wartime. Billing's plot of
  homosexual invasion and its specific appeal to the emerging cultural
  recognition of female homosexuality provided a means of representing,
  through a parodic sexual fantasy, the unrepresentable catastrophe of
  history. "The Cult of the Clitoris" scandal demonstrates that it is
  the very connotative suggestibility of lesbianism and its arousal of
  the imagination that makes Billing's plot so powerfully seductive.

<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Spectacle of the Courtroom, The Spectacle of <i>Salom&eacute;</i>
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
If the narrative leading up to the trial reads like a sensation novel,
then the scenes in the courtroom unfold as a dramatic performance that
rivals <i>Salom&eacute;</i>'s own histrionics of fatal desire. Billing
admittedly planted the libel in the <i>Vigilante</i> to attract legal
reaction and media attention, and his introduction to the <i>Verbatim
Report</i> encourages us to inherit the case as a spectacle whose
imaginative appeal exceeds its value as a legal document. He notes that
the official <i>Verbatim Report</i> does not provide



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
those keys to individual and public temper which in the familiar press
reports are usually supplied by parenthetical adjectives and nouns,
and therefore that such helps to the imagination as "(sarcastically),"
"(warmly)," "(great sensation)," and so forth, must be supplied by the
reader's own discretion. [<i>VR,</i> ix]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Beyond demonstrating Billing's scandal-mongering, this appeal reminds
us that we should read the trial not just within a legal or discursive
framework, but also according to the operations of imaginative fantasy
and interpretative possibility. As Billing writes with sweeping hyperbole,
the trial "caused the liveliest stirring of the public mind in all parts
of every continent where the English language is understood" (<i>VR,</i>
iii). Accordingly, he actively "stirred" the public imagination by acting
as his own legal representative with theatrical flare (he had four years'
experience as an actor), expanding his conspiracy plot to include every
member of the court--he accused the presiding judge and the counsel for
the prosecution of being among the 47,000--and calling a remarkable cast
of witnesses, including Wilde's former lover, Lord Alfred Douglas.

<p>
As a theatrical spectacle, the trial takes <i>Salom&eacute;</i> as its
source and inspiration. Billing contended that <i>Salom&eacute;</i> was
"an open representation of degenerated sexual lust, sexual crime, and
unnatural passions and an evil and mischievous travesty of a biblical
story" which "ministers to sexual perverts, Sodomites and Lesbians" and
renders them vulnerable to German influence and blackmail (<i>VR,</i>
476, 35). For Billing, the perversions of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> (both
text and character) are the perversions of Wilde are the perversions
of Allan are the perversions of the enemy that will destroy the British
nation. Billing and his witnesses testify that Salom&eacute;'s "climax"
in kissing/biting the lips of Iokanaan's severed head enacts Wilde's
own sexual orgasm of writing--to represent the scene in language is
to live the scene. This sexual climax is then transferred to Allan--to
represent the scene on the stage is to live the scene, and in turn Allan's
performance sexually influences the audience--to witness the scene as
spectator is to live the scene. Affective and physical experience is
mimetically relayed from one body to another through a simple circuit of
representation, performance, and spectatorship. This ease of associative
relay and substitution allowed the suggestion of lesbianism in the trial
to carry a range of seemingly unrelated wartime anxieties.

<p>
Billing's insinuation that Allan's performance is marked by a latent
lesbianism trades upon the suggestion that Wilde's own homosexuality
seeps into both his title character and the actress performing her. If
Salom&eacute; embodies Wilde's desire, then she is in effect a gay man
masquerading as a sadistic heterosexual woman. Furthermore, if in

<b></b>

Billing's reading Salom&eacute;'s violent passion for and power over
Iokanaan reverses conventional heterosexual dynamics of desire by
constructing the male body as a feminized object, then she resides
somewhere in the undefined territory of masculine female desire, a
paradox that easily slips into the shadowy realm of lesbian passion.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  And in Billing's chain of associations, if Wilde's betrayal of
  heterosexual norms is equivalent to a betrayal of state security,
  then Allan's performance implicates her in a queer German plot that
  simultaneously betrays nation and heterosexuality: "<i>Wives of
  men in supreme position were entangled. In Lesbian ecstasy the most
  sacred secrets of State were betrayed</i>" <i>(VR,</i> 452)<i>.</i>
  Any violation of the sacred marriage bond may violate the sacred
  secrets of state, and what better re for representing such a
  double agent than the fantasy of "Lesbian ecstasy"?

<p>
Billing's deployment of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> also engages with the play's
status as a symbolist drama. While definitions of literary symbolism
vary widely, Charles Chadwick cites St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute;'s
characterization of symbolism as the art of "evoking an object little
by little so as to reveal a mood or, conversely, the art of choosing
an object and extracting from it an '&eacute;tat d'&acirc;me,'" a mood,
Mallarm&eacute; insists, that "should be extracted 'par une s&eacute;rie
de d&eacute;chiffrements'--'by a series of decipherings.'"
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  The object is hinted at, suggested, gradually revealed. Chadwick
  considers a companion aspect of symbolism, in which "concrete images
  are used as symbols, not of particular thoughts and feelings," but
  of an ideal world.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  As Arthur Symons rhetorically asks in <i>The Symbolist Movement in
  Literature</i> , "What is symbolism if not an establishing of the
  links which hold the world together, the affirmation of an eternal,
  minute, intricate, almost invisible life, which runs through the
  whole universe?"
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
Critics have identified <i>Salom&eacute;</i> as symbolist in its use of
suggestive, mystical, and highly aestheticized language whose incantatory
musicality crosses boundaries of dream and reality, reference and
evasion, representation and affect. However, given the wartime concern
over secret agents and codes, any implied mysteries hidden in ambiguous
language were suspect. As we will see, the idealized symbolist notion of
"links which hold the world together" finds a parodic manifestation as
political paranoia in Billing's conspiracy theory that connected the
<i>Salom&eacute;</i> production with the "intricate, almost invisible
life" of secret agents and international espionage. In other words,
Billinganchored the possibility of symbolic suggestion to history,
politics, and morality by reifying the "links" that held together Wilde's
world of art and Britain's situation in wartime.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
In this process of reification, the suggestion of lesbianism functions
remarkably like a symbol in the "symbolist" sense. It operates as a
re for revealing a state of mood and/or as a material substitute
for the intangible, floating, "minute, intricate, almost invisible"
life pervading the British cultural atmosphere of 1918. Indeed, Billing
might have turned the ultimate symbolist phrase, since "The Cult of the
Clitoris" purported to harbor an explicit referential content while
simultaneously refusing stable referentiality in favor of infinite
suggestion. It effectively symbolized a complex of affective relations
among war, sexuality, gender, art, and politics that otherwise resist
articulation, achieving this effect through a "series of decipherings,"
hints, and suggestions. In a Freudian sense, the phrase is a condensation
that "represents several associative

<b></b>

chains at whose point of intersection it is located," while in a
Foucaultian sense, it also signals a cultural dispersion with its
suggestion that deviant female sexuality is distributed throughout
discursive formations and infuses all aspects of political life.

Sexual Sedition: 
<br />
Resurrecting Wilde, Anatomizing Allan
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The scandal of "The Cult of the Clitoris" relied upon the scandalous--and
seditious--connotations of Wilde's name that had been established through
his own trials and imprisonment. As Ed Cohen, Regenia Gagnier, and others
have demonstrated, these trials identified Wilde's artistic production,
aestheticism, and self-fashioning with his sexual "gross indecency."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  A rhetoric of national threat conflated aestheticism with national
  betrayal and displaced anxieties about counterhegemonic sexual
  activities onto aesthetic movements. Perhaps precisely because Wilde
  was such an icon of social danger, his presence was recalled and
  redeployed in the years between his trial and the Billing trial. Most
  notably, between the spring of 1913 and the autumn of 1914, there
  were legalbattles involving Wilde's biographer, Arthur Ransome, his
  former lover, Alfred Douglas,and his literary executor, Robert Ross.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  With the specter of Wilde conjured up particularly close to wartime,
  his performative invocation and abjection functioned to consolidate
  national identity and "vigor." We could read Billing's trial as
  just another addition to this history of early-twentieth-century
  deployments of Wilde's ghost; however, as I have proposed, in this
  trial the threat of Wilde was supplemented and perhaps exceeded by the
  threat of lesbian sexual espionage. While Wilde's infamy certainly
  underwrote Billing's homosexual plot, "The Cult of the Clitoris"
  introduced dangerous female homosexuality as a new perversion to be
  discussed, scandalized, and rallied against.

<p>
The very phrase "The Cult of the Clitoris" combines the shock of
anatomical reference with the suggestive danger of female sexual and
political independence. With limited female suffrage imminent, the
phrase traded upon doubts and fears about recent successes in feminism,
the gathering of women in political movements and public labor, and
the constitution of the female citizen. The phrase actually grafted the
aesthetic decadence of "the cult of Wilde" onto the concern that women's
citizenship would free them from their traditional role of bearing and
raising citizens for the empire.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  Notably, the primary re of "The Cult of the Clitoris" was Maud
  Allan, the most unlikely <i>and</i> most suitable re for effecting
  this shift from Wilde's aesthetic and sexual threat in the 1890s to
  women's political-sexual threat in the late war years.

<p>
Unlike Wilde's legendary infamy, Allan's public recognition, like her
dancing that made her briefly but thoroughly famous, was a fleeting
gesture that momentarily entranced audiences, but left little trace
of its performance. By 1918 her career was in fact declining, but
the trial evoked the cultural memory of her eroticism, aestheticism,
mass cultural appeal, and high society affiliations. A North American,
Allan studied music in Berlin, then began a dancing career in Europe
and Russia; when she performed before King Edward while he was on
holiday in Europe, he encouraged her to bring her talent to England
(<i>SD,</i> 152). Subsequently, clever marketing tactics rendered her
dance "The Vision of Salome" a succ&egrave;s de scandale at London's
Palace Theatre in

<b></b>

1908, catapulting her to fame, breaking box office records, and gaining
her a position in London society. Reviewers repeatedly deployed the
metaphor of hypnosis to convey her mysterious power to seduce, but not
offend, her audience with her erotic and orientalizing dance. Those
scandalized by Allan associated her with Wilde's degeneracy,
but this hint of perversion only spiced up the gossip about her
social affiliations. With her fame, she secured the patronage and
friendship of Prime Minister Asquith and forged a particular intimacy
with his wife, Margot, a relationship which "caused talk if not open
speculation in social, diplomatic, and political circles," and which
would be exploited by Billing in the trial, given rumors of Margot
Asquith's unconventionality and lesbian-coded female coterie (<i>SD,</i>
176). Inevitably, Allan could not sustain her hypnotic spell over her
audience, particularly once a campaign of demystification was instigated
by the very media that had once promulgated her fascination.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  A past fad by 1918, she was most likely attempting to revive
  her fame by taking her first dramatic speaking role in Wilde's
  <i>Salom&eacute;</i>; however, the very attributes which had once
  enticed the Edwardian public had been re-inscribed as national dangers
  by this time.

<p>
Certainly, Allan's artistic and erotic notoriety offended the wartime
conservatism in art and morality. Her popularization of what one reviewer
called the "sensuous, decadent, <i>macabre</i>" and her training in
Germany coded her as suspicious to a country that blamed French-inflected
decadence for the national decay that led to war, and was intolerant of
any hint of German Kultur.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  If her erotic dance had flirted with an association with Wilde's
  play--and his infamy--a decade earlier, Allan now took the risk,
  during a reactionary political climate, of foregoing any difference
  between her Salom&eacute; and Wilde's. Without a king's sanction to
  hide behind, her affiliations with the Asquiths did not help her
  reputation. Forced to resign as prime minister in December 1916,
  Asquith had proved a failure under the exigencies of war, and his
  continued association with artistic circles had only contributed to
  doubts about his ability to lead an aggressive, patriotic campaign.

<p>
By 1918, the exoticism, sexual danger, artistic innovation, and
political liaisons upon which Allan had built her earlier fame were
attached to a new female archetype: the sexually and politically
dangerous spy-seductress. Just months before Billing initiated his
campaign against <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> Mata Hari was executed in Paris
for espionage. Born Margeretha Geertruida Zelle, Mata Hari left her
notoriously abusive husband in 1904, changed her identity, embarked on
a dancing career even more risqu&eacute; and orientalizing than Allan's,
and undertook an unapologetic life as a courtesan, taking lovers of the
highest military rank, including German officials.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  When war was declared, all that Mata Hari represented came under
  suspicion: her eroticism, exoticism, refusal of domestic femininity,
  and sexual promiscuity violated the wartime mood of sacrifice,
  restraint, and conservatism. Accustomed to inventing and reinventing
  her identity, Mata Hari mixed her stories and acquaintances one too
  many times and was eventually arrested. Although little hard evidence
  was gathered against her, she was swiftly condemned as a spy, and
  her legend as the female secret service agent par excellence fed the
  propaganda machine. Her Eastern identification and sexual repertoire
  invited an easy conflation of moral laxity with national deception
  and foreign difference, and her

<b></b>

role as mistress to men in power elaborated the femme-fatale stereotype
into a re whose sexual power not only destroyed men and threatened
marriage, but also imperiled national security.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  Such fantasies engendered in Mata Hari were directly transferable to
  Allan at a time when spy-paranoia was escalating.

<p>
The Billing trial was situated in and significantly contributed to a
volatile period of home front anxieties, manifest in anti-alien sentiment
that included both mob violence and official reaction against anything
and anyone remotely German.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  The first months of 1918 witnessed England exhausted and pessimistic
  about the outcome of the war. The aggressive German offensive in
  March shook the nation as the stalemate of trench warfare shifted
  into a campaign of action, including air raids on England. Historians
  Trevor Wilson and John Terraine concur that as tensions between
  military leaders and the government increased, the public, denied
  clear explanations, displaced its anxiety onto a renewed campaign
  against enemy aliens.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  Billing's conspiracy of the "47,000" further resonated with
  war propaganda that explicitly aligned homosexuality with German
  degeneracy, and the paranoid fantasy of "the enemy within" conflated
  spy fever with homophobia. Alfred Douglas promulgated this association
  in his 1915 sonnet, "All's Well with England," which concludes:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Out there in Flanders all the trampled ground
<br />
Is red with English blood . . .
<br />. . . Who will count the loss,
<br />
Since here 'at home' sits merry Margot, bound
<br />
With Lesbian fillets, while with front of brass
<br />
'Old Squiffy' hands the purse to Robert Ross.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
"English blood" is spilled "out there in Flanders" while "at home"
homosexuality is not only practiced but rewarded by a decadent
government. The next year Douglas published <i>The Rossiad,</i> which
concludes with an appeal to England:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
O England, in thine hour of need . . .
<br />
Raise up the best, hack down the worst,
<br />
Tear from thy heart the thing accurst.
<br />
Two foes thou hast, one there one here,
<br />
One far, one intimately near,
<br />
Two filthy fogs blot out thy light:
<br />
The German, and the Sodomite. [ibid.]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Douglas's conjoining of the "The foe without, the foe within" brings the
war "intimately near" by identifying the foreign enemy with the deviant
sexuality lurking within the British people.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  This association of homosexuality, high society, national betrayal,
  andsocial decay had a long-standing history, but it was Billing's
  trial that brought such sentiments into public debate at a particularly
  vulnerable cultural moment and condensed them into the single cryptic
  phrase, "The Cult of the Clitoris." As the point of transference for
  such a range of allusions and connotations, and as the key utterance in
  the libel charge, the question of "The Cult of the Clitoris"--what it
  meant, to whom it referred, and who could interpret it--was a primary
  obsession in the trial.

<b></b>



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Reading Cults and Clits
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The "Cult of the Clitoris" paragraph produces its distinct scandalous
effects by staging an irresistible seductive scene of reading that
initiates an elaborate sexual fantasy. The detective-reader must
sort out the allusions and decode the meaning: Who or what is this
cult? Who or what are the 47,000? And perhaps the most puzzling
question for many early-twentieth-century readers: What, exactly,
is a clitoris? The paragraph compels the reader into a sexy game of
reading and allusion--but one that, like a coded war message or a
spy-thriller novel, has (for Billing at least) a distinct secret to be
deciphered and exposed. The phrase inflames the imagination and provokes
interpretation, thus allowing Billing to intervene in the courtroom and
unveil the underlying plot. The libel achieves its impact by forcing a
convergence of deviant activities that amplifies the panic over national
vulnerability while enlisting the most undefined realm of danger, "The
Cult of the Clitoris," as the rhetorical gathering point for all other
anxieties. As we have seen, in Billing's formulation, the spectacle
of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> occasions a relay of meanings and perversions,
from author to actress to audience. Similarly, the phrase, "The Cult of
the Clitoris," conjoins the allusions and associations of immorality,
national betrayal, homosexuality, and aestheticism. The salience of the
phrase rests upon the suggestive invocation of female homosexuality,
whose lack of a recognizable popular symbolization renders it most
appealing for symbolic appropriation. It is precisely the language of
the female body--the female nonreproductive but desiring body--that
simultaneously demands and refuses interpretative attention, inciting
scandal through its very resistance to representation. Unprintable in
the newspapers, the obscene absence of the phrase "Cult of the Clitoris"
vexes interpretation. Its lesbian meaning, the prosecution will argue,
is obscenely obvious, but a cross fire of courtroom attempts to decipher
the phrase culminates in Billing literally retracting the belabored
lesbian signified from the range of interpretive possibilities.

<p>
In the police proceedings, the counsel for the prosecution, Sir Travers
Humphreys, who had also represented Wilde in his trials, introduces the
libel with a web of circumlocution. He deems it "an attack of a sort
which I hesitate to characterize in language . . . unworthy of any man
to have made upon any woman" (<i>VR,</i> 4). Guiding attention to the
newspaper, he continues, "I find words which I must read, although I
see there are some ladies in Court. I must read them aloud: 'The Cult
of the Clitoris.'. . . it is my submission the words themselves are
the filthiest words it would be possible to imagine" (ibid.). And yet,
he immediately asserts,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What they mean no one can doubt; no one can doubt who reads the words
as they are. . . . [T]he coupling of the name of anyone with that cross
heading in leaded type . . . can only mean one thing, and that is that
the lady whose name is coupled with it, either in her private or in
her professional life, approves of that which is sometimes described in
perhaps less--I do not know whether it is less objectionable--but less
gross language as lesbianism, and a more horrible libel of any woman
. . . is impossible to find. [<i>VR,</i> 5-6]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Humphreys claims that the unimaginable title and its association
with Allan's name in the paragraph are obvious in their "meaning" and
implication, thereby bypassing any interpretive process. According to
Humphreys, the "coupling" of a woman's name and a clitoral cult "can only
mean one thing," when in fact, the relationship between Allan's name and
the title--this "coupling"--hangs suspended in possibility. Humphreys
plugs up this epistemological gap with repeated assertions of the
transparent meaning of the "coupling." His conspicuous discomfort over
uttering the title in the presence of women further codes the phrase
as obviously criminally unutterable while maintaining the assumption of
female sexual innocence.

<p>
Ultimately, his evasion of interpretation culminates in syntactical
confusion and referential failure:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the meaning of that paragraph so far as I have read it is that there is
some connection between [Mr. Grein's] proposed production of this play
and that cult as it is called, which is the explanation of the paragraph,
because that is what it is. Without it, the paragraph is meaningless,
it means nothing at all. Under that heavily leaded type heading it means
there is some connection with the nameless vice between women, and the
performance at the Independent Theatre which is announced. [<i>VR,</i> 6]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The paragraph and its title achieve a singular meaning that cannot
be named, a meaning which becomes lost in wandering referents (for
example, "because that is what it is"? "Without <i>it</i>"? <i>Which</i>
"it"?). Humphreys compensates for his obscure explanation by emphasizing
the "heavily leaded type" of the graphic title (a typographical detail he
repeats in this speech), and insisting on its indelible black-and-white
obscenity. The lesbian meaning is somehow an effect of the graphic type,
so that the ink of publicity stains the reputation of those it names
as it does the fingers of its readers. As reference and interpretation
fail, words become the things that inscribe them; the materiality of the
printed letter stands in for the reference that the utterance itself
obscures. Obvious but nameless lesbian meaning occurs as the point
of conjunction among title, typeset, names of body parts, and names
of actresses.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  By referring to lesbianism as a "nameless" vice while lamenting
  the association of Allan's <i>name</i> with such a vice, Humphreys
  performs a move similar to the one that occurred in Wilde's trial,
  in which Wilde's namewas substituted for the terms "sodomy" or "acts
  of gross indecency."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  In effect, Humphreyssuggests that such a coupling of Allan's
  proper name with the suggestive but referentially indeterminate
  title scandalizes Allan's name to a greater degree than if a more
  explicit accusation had been published. Her name supplies the point
  of determinate reference that the cryptic title refuses, a coupling
  which Humphreys both criticizes and exploits.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
In his questioning of Allan, Humphreys again asserts the paragraph's
criminal offense by evading its explanation. He refuses to repeat the
paragraph's title, but asks Allan if she regards it as a libel. "I do,"
she affirms, and then Humphreys pauses to address the ruling magistrate:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Sir John, I should like to have your ruling upon this subject. I do not
propose to ask the Witness what her understanding is of the libel. I
will not ask any further questions unless

<b></b>

there is some matter so obscure to an ordinary person--unless you desire
it, Sir, I do not think I should ask any more than I have, that she
regards that as a libel upon herself; but of course it is for you to
say. [<i>VR,</i> 17-8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Responding, "Certainly, I agree," the magistrate halts the explanation by
admitting to "know" what Humphreys insists any "ordinary person" would
know without naming (ibid.). The magistrate and Humphreys collude in an
interpretive conspiracy of transparent meanings; as "gentlemen," they
"hesitate to characterize in language" the "meaning" of Billing's attack,
for to do so would violate gender chivalry, according to Humphreys's
characterization of the libel as "unworthy of any man to have made upon
any woman" (<i>VR,</i> 4). This unspoken agreement between magistrate
and counsel suggests a male homosocial community of knowledge about
female deviant desire, a desire whose utterance must be protected from
its very object of reference.

<p>
The positions of knowing established at the Bow Street Police Court are
reoriented in the criminal proceedings at the Old Bailey, tried before
a jury. The counsel conres the jury (who are supposedly, unlike the
learned magistrate, <i>really</i> "ordinary people") in a position of
innocent ignorance, for in this case to position them as knowing what
the coupling means would interpellate them within a community of prurient
knowledge. In the above exchange between Humphreys and the magistrate, the
two agree to share this knowledge in order to protect others' innocence
and certainly to contain interpretation. Lawyer and judge conspire in a
shared understanding that the Old Bailey proceedings then construct as
extraordinary, exclusive knowledge.

<p>
Ellis Hume Williams, now leading the prosecution for the Crown in the
Central Criminal Court, approaches the libel with the same theatrical
caution as Humphreys: "Gentlemen, I am afraid once and for all, unpleasant
as the task is--more particularly as I see that there are some women in
the court--I must describe to you (if these ladies <i>will</i> stay)
what the meaning of that phrase is" (<i>VR,</i> 57). Again, Williams
makes his point about the danger of Billing's libel by suggesting
that it threatens the sexual innocence of women. To counter Billing's
suggestion that women know more and do more in the nation and in bed
than popular culture will admit, the prosecution deliberately constructs
the female spectators in the courtroom as most vulnerable in their
ignorance. Williams trades upon and controverts Billing's suggestion
that the spectacle of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> will immorally infect its
spectators by now constructing the courtroom as a space that must be
protected from the dangerous influence of Billing's words. Williams's
parenthetical phrase "(if these ladies <i>will</i> stay)" reads as a
rhetorical aside, and yet there is a sense in which he suggests that
since the ladies <i>will</i> insist on staying in the courtroom then he
<i>must</i> describe the meaning of the libel, thereby amplifying the
threat of female homosexuality through the very act of interpretation.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>

<p>
Forced to explain the libel, Williams constructs the ability to read
it accurately as dependent upon specific knowledge which he must,
unfortunately, disclose:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
You probably may have some idea, but unless you have some physiological
knowledge you will not appreciate in its fullness what the gross obscenity
of this phrase is. . . . [Y]ou cannot appreciate the gravity of the
charge against this lady unless you appreciate what the real meaning is
of this horrible phrase. [<i>VR,</i> 57-8]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
He performatively attempts to short-circuit the paragraph's seductive
potential with the intervention of scientific facts, didactically
explaining that because clitoral pleasure is unnecessary to procreation,
it is necessarily a lesbian vice. In Williams's interpretation, if
"clitoris" operates as a metonym for lesbianism, then its utterance in
conjunction with a woman's name clearly constitutes the worst accusation
to make against any woman: that she indulges a sexual desire extraneous
to any biological or social reproduction for the state.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  In a Darwinian language of natural science, Williams undertakes what
  must be a first in British legal history: a graphic explanation of
  the situation and function of the clitoris, and its method of arousal
  in lesbian sexual practices.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  With rhetoric that recalls nineteenth-century campaigns against
  masturbation, Williams denounces lesbian practices as "degrading,
  repulsive, contrary to nature, and consequently destructive of
  health--practices which, indulged in to any extent, sap and undermine
  the sanity and probity and self-respect . . . of those who indulge
  in them" (<i>VR,</i> 58). Ultimately, however, in order to stabilize
  the offensive meaning of the libel, he must have recourse to male
  homosexuality:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If this paragraph had been dealing with men instead of with women
and had been headed "The cult of the penis," it would have required no
explanation. "The cult of the clitoris" is worse; it means the deliberate
perversion of all the natural instincts that nature has implanted in
man and woman, to the practice of a filthy, enervating and degrading
vice. . . . [reads paragraph aloud] What is the meaning of that? What
is the meaning of the heading "The Cult of the Clitoris?" It can have
no other reference than to the practice of this Lesbian vice; no other
meaning is possible. [ibid.]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Much like Humphreys's argument in the police court, Williams finally just
asserts the single possible reading that the title and paragraph make
necessary, although here he provides a considerable lesson in anatomy and
natural history. His simple declaration that "The Cult of the Clitoris"
is worse than "The Cult of the Penis" is devoid of any argument as to
why. In fact, the prosecution's strategy here rests upon a paradoxical
tautology: an argument that asserts transparent moral obviousness must
not be diluted or weakened by argumentation.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  Within the problematic of interpretation, perhaps "The Cult of the
  Clitoris" is worse because it requires such lengthy explanation and
  interpretation. Since the location and "function" of the clitoris
  is so obscure and not known to the "ordinary" individual, the need
  for an uncomfortably explicit and protracted translation culminates
  in an atmosphere of enervated, exhausted shame. Certainly Williams's
  argument from analogy attests to the phrase's resistance to cultural
  legibility; supposedly anyone would know what "The Cult of the
  Penis" means, whereas Billing has manufactured a far more disturbing
  scene of perversion precisely because it refuses immediate cultural
  comprehension.

<p>
The speculation about "The Cult of the Penis" should also remind us that
this scandal over traitorous female body parts occurred at a time when
the British male body was being mutilated and dismembered on a scale
never before experienced. Men at the front encountered the unprecedented
ability of technological warfare to blow the male body into grotesque
fragments; those injured bodies that did survive hand grenades,

<b></b>

artillery fire, shelling, and surgical amputations testified to the
inconceivable experience of modern war. As Joanna Bourke writes, "The
horror of front-line dismemberment was beyond the imagination of many
civilians in Britain. They were not, however, totally unaware of its
impact on hundreds of thousands of men's bodies."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  The returned injured soldier provided a corporeal metonym of the
  war's unimaginable violence against male bodies and masculinity
  itself. "In war," Bourke writes, "the injured man was not disabled
  but mutilated. He was the fit man, the potent man, <i>rendered</i>
  impotent. He was mutilated and mutilator in one."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  Bourke's use of the loaded notion of male impotence alludes to
  castration as the classic trope of damaged masculinity. Trudi Tate
  suggests that "the distressing presence of war-injured men" effected a
  gender crisis by complicating the Freudian schema of gender difference
  in which the imaginary wholeness of phallic masculinity is constructed
  in opposition to women's castration.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
  "The Cult of the Clitoris" partakes of this wartime disruption of
  gender distinction constituted upon visible difference. The phrase
  dismembers and thus diminishes the female body, but it also invokes
  the danger of female sexual difference. It gestures to the genital
  "nothing" that constitutes female sexuality and, since the clitoris
  has been historically compared to the penis, it also signals the
  threat of a phallic woman. If masculinity was constructed against
  femininity's lack, then "The Cult of the Clitoris" confronts the
  vulnerable masculine body in wartime with a particularly menacing
  feminine sexual corporeality.

<p>
While a seemingly inexhaustible range of connotations emanate from
Billing's paragraph, the law had to judge its legal meaning. Whereas
Humphreys's speech for the prosecution at Bow Street suggested a vague
"connection" or relationship of "approval" between Allan and "unnatural
practices," the specific indictment for the Old Bailey trial claimed
that the title and paragraph meant



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
thereby that the said Maud Allan was a lewd, unchaste and immoral woman
and was about to give private performances of an obscene and indecent
character so designed as to foster and encourage obscene and unnatural
practices among women and that the said Maud Allan associated herself
with persons addicted to obscene and unnatural practices. [<i>VR,</i> 472]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Billing's plea of justification then not only stated that this indictment
was "true," but further denounced <i>Salom&eacute;</i> as "an open
representation of degenerated sexual lust, sexual crime, and unnatural
passions and an evil and mischievous travesty of a biblical story"
that was written by "a moral pervert" and was particularly attractive
to the German agents' list of the 47,000 (<i>VR,</i> 476). Notably, the
prosecution--not the publisher of the paragraph--actually translated
for the court what the libel meant; Billing merely claimed that this
reading was true and justified, and added the emphasis on the underlying
German invasion plot. However, because the indictment alludes to, but
does not explicitly <i>name</i> lesbianism, it opens a conspicuous gap
of interpretive possibilities, a gap which left considerable space for
Billing to mount an attack on Allan while evading specific definitions.

Experts and Perverts
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
When questioned about the meaning of the "Cult of the Clitoris,"
Dr. Serrell Cooke, an "expert" medical witness, explained that
"Clitoris is a Greek word, it is a medical term altogether; it has
nothing to do with ordinary language; nobody but a medical man, or
people interested in that kind of thing would understand the term"
(<i>VR,</i> 259). Semi-clarifying that "that kind of thing" refers
to sexual perversion, Cooke concludes, "'The Cult of the Clitoris,'
would have been very well understood by all the perverts all over the
world. It would not have been understood by ordinary people" (<i>VR,</i>
260). With "clitoris" as a transnational signifier that unites "all the
perverts all over the world," Cooke and the defense transforms the "cult"
of the clitoris into a cult of readers who can interpret the phrase. In
other contexts, Billing referred to the "initiated" as the only readers
who could understand the title.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  This sense of a seductive cult of reading, which recalls the
  construction of Wilde in his trial, converges with the sexological
  taxonomies that constituted the homosexual as an exclusive species
  of shared traits, including shared discourse (recall the glossary in
  the German Prince's black book). Furthermore, in the war context,
  the suggestion of secret sects or communities "all overthe world"
  sharing bonds of language, practices, and values that supersede those
  of national loyalty draws upon and exacerbates paranoid fantasies of
  spies with shared codes, secret languages, and hidden allegiances. This
  distrust of nontransparent language feeds into the wartime crisis of
  knowing and reading, and backs Billing's legal defense.

<p>
As we have seen, Allan's lawyers play a game of interpretation with the
libel, alternately insisting on the obvious meaning of the paragraph,
and then assuming an innocent ignorance of the audience whom they must
educate into an appreciation of the libel's unimaginable horror. Billing's
defense turns such constructions to his own advantage: how could Allan
be innocent if she were able to recognize the phrase as an insult,
as a lesbian allusion? In a tactic that relies upon the expert versus
pervert opposition, Billing's cross-examination of Allan links knowledge
and sexual immorality:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Did Mr. Grein explain to you where the libel was and exactly
what it meant?
<br />
Allan: I do not think it is necessary for anyone to explain that paragraph
to me . . .
<br />
Billing: You are well acquainted with the names that arise in connection
with the [alleged libelous] matter?. . . [P]articularly with that one
[i.e. the clitoris]?
<br />
Allan: Not particularly at all, Mr. Billing.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Through his questions, Billing ascertains that yes, friends of Allan
saw the libel and understood its meaning, but no, neither she nor they
are medical students. Billing then triumphantly crows, "Are you aware,
Miss Allan, that out of twenty-four people who were shown that libel,
including many professional men, only one of them, who happened to be
a barrister, understood what it meant?" (<i>VR,</i> 85).

<p>
Admitting only two mutually exclusive realms of interpreters, educated
professionals and degenerate perverts, Billing demands Allan identify
herself in one group or the other. He then collapses the language of
homosexual aestheticism with the language of the German enemy when he
takes up Allan's autobiography and fixates on her study

<b></b>

and milieu in Germany. Reading such passages as "[In Berlin] I came
in touch with a broader spirit of what I had best call bohemian
bon camaraderie," and "the German tongue was our Esperanto," Billing
insinuates that Allan was part of an international "cult" whose adoption
of German as its common language marked it as morally depraved danger
to the British nation (qtd. in <i>VR,</i> 87).

<p>
Next, Billing reads passages from <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> insisting on
their perverse sexual meaning. Allan denies such an interpretation,
maintaining that Salom&eacute; is an innocent girl whose spirituality,
not her sexuality, is aroused in her relationship with Iokanaan. Allan's
refusal to read the play as remotely erotic belies her untenable position
in facing lesbian accusations; she is more on trial than the defendant
and must maintain her claim to chastity.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  Ultimately, Allan's promotion of the play as spiritual and artistic
  is deployed against her. Billing insists that rather than proving her
  innocence, Allan's refusal to acknowledge the play's vice betrays her
  loyalty to the "cult" of readers who find beauty in perversity. Again,
  much like Wilde's trials, in which Wilde's modes of reading were
  considered symptomatic of his "gross indecency," Billing attempts to
  discredit Allan by constructing her as an "extraordinary" reader whose
  performance of a text by the "high priest" of an "outrageous cult"
  would appeal to the initiated.

<p>
While Allan claims that neither she nor Wilde is responsible for Billing's
prurient readings, Billing re-appropriates the same strategy with the
claim, "You quite understand that I am not responsible for what you read
into the libel," which leads to an explicit comparison of the libel with
the play:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Which do you think is the most likely to pervert public morals
in this country, the witnessing of such a play or the reading of the
paragraph complained of. [sic] Which do you think likely to do most harm
to the young men and the young women?
<br />
Allan: The paragraph that you have had printed in your paper.
<br />
Billing: Will you tell me why?
<br />
Allan: Because you suggest things to them that they do not know anything
about, and the curiosity of man is such that they will go and find out.
<br />
Billing: Are there any suggestions at all in this play?
<br />
Allan: Not that I know; if there are they are so veiled as not to
be obvious.
<br />
Billing: You think that that [paragraph] title is unveiled?
<br />
Allan: I think that it is draped from the shoulder.
<br />
Billing: It was meant to be understood by those who could understand it,
but was not meant to be understood by others?
<br />
Allan: That is what you say. [<i>VR,</i> 113-4]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Allan's apt metaphor of veiled language foregrounds the trial's contest
over translation and interpretation, and implicitly evaluates the libel
according to symbolist principles. For Allan, the artistic merit and legal
defense of <i>Salom&eacute;</i> rests in its fully veiled language. Signs
and symbols are caught up in such a thoroughgoing economy of shifting
signification that no phrase holds a single obvious meaning and desire
can never be categorized. Billing's libel, however, draped from the
shoulder and only half-veiled, insinuates enough that the correspondences
it forges intend to communicate vice and trap the vicious. According to
Allan, Billing's intention that the reader of "The Cult of

<b></b>

the Clitoris" paragraph should arrive at a particular sexual and political
meaning renders Billing guilty of the very vice of immoral suggestion of
which he is accusing Wilde. Allan's suitably elusive metaphor demonstrates
the potential of rative language with the effect of exposing Billing's
attempt to appropriate the symbolist impulse. Billing wants to fasten
guilt and shame with knowledge and absolute interpretations, while
Wilde's text and Allan's testimony staunchly refuse any such equation.

<p>
Veils and draperies here are also telling. Allan's metaphor suggests that
Billing's "draping" anticipates a dramatic unveiling, exposing a final,
naked body of lesbian meaning. The phrase "The Cult of the Clitoris" cites
the perverse materiality of the body--Allan's body--with the intent of
digging up Wilde's sentenced body to prove that its criminal corporeality
subtends <i>Salom&eacute;.</i> As Robert Ross wrote in a private letter
about the trial, "Kicking the corpse of Wilde has also been a pleasure
to the English people even if they disapprove of Billing's methods."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  Billing's methods include casting suspicion upon Allan and Grein's
  reading practices by aligning them with the perverted symbolist
  aestheticism that veils and thus signifies Wilde's condemned homosexual
  body. Constructing his defense by prosecuting modes of reading,
  Billing invokes a play of allusion and correspondences which ultimately
  relies upon and references Wilde's established perversion. Wilde's
  "corpus" thus functions as the legibly deviant body that anchors and
  underscores the illegibility of the lesbian accusation.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

<!--_a-head-->
The Topsy Turvey Language of a Homosexualist
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Dr. Serrell Cooke, who defined the interpretive communities capable of
understanding the term clitoris, was Billing's most important expert
witness. Although a specialist in tuberculosis, Cooke claimed to be an
expert in matters of sexual psychology because he had studied Ricard von
Krafft-Ebing's <i>Psychopathia Sexualis</i> . Supposedly, after
he attended the hearings at Bow Street, he read <i>Salom&eacute;,</i>
"consulted several well-known London doctors about the play," and prepared
"a detailed medical synopsis of the play, explaining what it was really
all about" (<i>SLV,</i> 149). Under Billing's questioning, Cooke offered
an extraordinary sexual-linguistic diagnosis that (con)fused the symbolic
weight of Wilde with the alleged plot of German queer invasion. He told
the court that Grein's testimony exhibited a "rather extraordinary"
use of language. "Things which were physical, material, he described as
spiritual, poetic, beautiful," Cooke explained, noting that such language
"is usually employed by homosexualists" (<i>VR,</i> 248, 249):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Is it customary for sex perverts to describe as beautiful and
glorious all their perversions? . . . And is it customary for them to
read into the distinctly physical acts of sex something spiritual?
<br />
Cooke: Spiritual, poetic, beautiful, pure love; those are their
expressions. . . . It is done because they cannot help themselves. I
think it is part of their mental condition.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In addition to undermining Grein, Cooke's testimony also reflects back on
Allan's cross-examination, as it diagnoses any symbolic mode of reading as
"customary for sex perverts."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<b></b>

This perverse mode of interpretation can be appropriated or mimicked,
regardless of the speaker's sexual activity. Much like the instructive
glossary in the German black book, the patois can be learned and
deployed. Under cross-examination, Cooke evades accusing Grein of
homosexual <i>acts</i> (and thus evades libeling Grein) by making both
an association and a distinction between modes of reading and sexual
practices. When Cooke explains that he considers Grein's language "the
language of a sodomist," "Because he describes the sadistic acts [in
<i>Salom&eacute;</i>] . . . as something beautiful, spiritual, poetic,"
Williams cautions him, "Do you realise that to bring an accusation against
a man of being a sodomist is the most terrible thing to be said against
a man?" Cooke clarifies:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Cooke: I have not brought such accusation against any man. . . . It is
a curious matter of psychology that a man should use such language in
the description of this play.
<br />
Williams: Do not you think you left the Jury and the Court under the
impression that you were intending to convey that the man who used the
language of a sodomist used it because he was one?
<br />
Cooke: No, I did not intend to leave any such impression on the
Jury. [<i>VR,</i> 263-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Cooke relies upon an analogy that discredits Grein while protecting
himself: Grein reads Wilde "like" a homosexual (because he reads Wilde,
likes Wilde, and reads like Wilde) but this homosexual parlance does
not mean Grein <i>is</i> a homosexual. The particular claim that to read
like a homosexual means to read inversely--physical as spiritual, vice as
beauty--insists on a hermeneutics of homosexual contrariness that requires
a straight interpreter who could re-invert the claims of homosexual
speech in order to translate them into "ordinary" speech. This logic
also assumes a foundational "ordinary language" of direct reference, in
contradistinction to the symbolist mode where interpretations proliferate
but are never resolved. Billing and Cooke's game of inverse signification
easily aligns "speaking like a homosexualist" with both the propagandist
portrayal of Germany as a morally inverted culture, and the general
panic over the secret codes of foreign agents.

<p>
This construction of Wilde's inverted language is clinched when the
"original" translator of his play, Lord Alfred Douglas, takes the stand
as witness for the defense. He represents himself as straddling the space
between ordinary and extraordinary reading, in the dual position of expert
and ex-pervert. He insists that he was "entirely under Wilde's influence"
during the writing of <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> but now recognizes him to
be "the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the
last 350 years" (<i>VR,</i> 291, 287). Claiming that, "I translated the
play from the French, and I had many conversations with Wilde about it,
and I have a very particular knowledge of what he meant by the play,"
he contends that Wilde



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
intended the play to be an exhibition of perverted sexual passion
excited in a young girl. . . . [T]here is one passage which is
sodomitic. . . . Wilde was a man who cloaked up those things in flowery
language. He never used the word "sodomitic." He would express horror
at such language. Anything like the "Cult of the Clitoris" would fill
him with as much

<b></b>

horror as it apparently does Mr. Hume Williams. . . . [Who] share[s]
the horror of coarse and vulgar expressions, calling things by their
right names. [<i>VR,</i> 286]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, calling "things" what they <i>are not</i>, and an aversion to
calling things what they <i>are</i>, indicate an inverted sense of sexual
morality and a shameful guilt. Douglas's strategy, which privileges
"right names," even casts suspicion upon Williams's earlier performance
of his offense and disgust at the paragraph title.

<p>
With all symbolic modes of reading coded as perverted, Billing and Douglas
morally denounce the play's metaphorics, particularly the dialogue's
symbolic investment in the moon:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: In your opinion has Oscar Wilde used the moon as a canvas on
which to paint pictures which were almost too revolting to do in any
other way?<br />
Douglas: Yes to paint the situation of the play as it proceeded.<br />
Judge: . . . Did he use the moon in this version as a canvas on which
to paint indecent and abominable pictures?<br />
Douglas: Yes, he did. Oh, yes.<br />
Billing: Would he have considered that the most artistic way of doing
it? . . . The most intellectual?
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Douglas: To him all that sort of thing, whenever he was going to do
anything particularly horrible, it was always disguised in the most
flowery language, and always referred back to Art. That was his idea of
Art. [VR, 292]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
When asked about Salom&eacute;'s desire for Iokanaan, Douglas translates
and explicates Wilde's mode of perverse representation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Did Wilde mean [Salom&eacute;'s desire to touch Iokanaan's body]
to be physical or spiritual?<br />
Douglas: Physical. If anyone calls it spiritual it is a pure misuse of
words and making the English language ridiculous.<br />
Billing: Would you call that language the language of a sodomite?<br />
Douglas: I think [Wilde] was referring to the language used by people
who described it as spiritual. . . . [T]hose sort of people always
refer to revolting things under pretty names. They try to disguise the
horribleness of the action by giving it such names; they say beautiful,
classic, and so on. They will not speak of it by the outspoken English
name; they disguise it.<br />
Billing: Have these people a common patois?<br />
Douglas: Yes, they have a jargon. I have not had anything to do with
them for twenty years. [<i>VR,</i> 294]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The lapse of twenty years and Douglas's conversion to Catholicism,
conservatism, and homophobia distance him from "those sort of people"
and secure his reliability, while positioning him as a privileged
interpreter. "Translating" Wilde's perverse slippage between the
physical and spiritual world, Douglas arrives at a hermeneutics of
absolute inversion:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Billing: Did Wilde . . . ever give you an idea, when you were doing your
translation, that it was anything other than a physical expression of
unnatural practices? . . . [D]id he give you to understand that it was
a poem dealing with the spiritual love of a young girl finding salvation
in the spirit of the Prophet, or a young girl seeking lustfully the body
of the Prophet?<br />
Douglas: The point is that that is exactly how he would describe it. He
probably did call it spiritual. That was part of the jargon.<br />
Billing: Do you call it spiritual?<br />
Douglas: No. Wilde would call it spiritual; he would say it was a study
in the curious passions of the human soul. That was the sort of euphemism
he would use. He never used plain coarse words at all. He was always
revolted by coarseness of expression.<br />
Judge: He would call spiritual what you call sadism?<br />
Douglas: Yes. With those sort of people evil is their good; everything
is topsy turvey; physical is spiritual; spiritual is physical, and so
on; it is a perversion, an inversion, of everything. Wilde was a man
who made evil his good all through his life. That was the gospel he
preached. [<i>VR,</i> 294-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
With Dr. Cooke's and Douglas's testimonies Billing composes a strategy
of inverse translation for reading Wilde, <i>Salom&eacute;,</i> Grein,
Allan, and "those sort of people." Douglas's repeated use of the terms
"disguise" and "cloaking up" again res Wilde's language and reading
as covering over the body upon which his sexual guilt is inscribed,
and it tropes upon the enemy spy who lurks beneath the disguise
of assimilation. Wilde's mode of reading for correspondences marks
him as trading in a suspicious economy of counterfeit signifiers,
an inverted code of meaning that must be decoded and exposed for its
dangerous content. Billing's primary strategy throughout the trial
was to queer and discredit Allan's, Grein's, and Wilde's hermeneutic
practices; suitably, he finally secured his "innocence" by insisting
that Allan's indictment had <i>misread</i> his paragraph. Indeed, the
ambiguity of the indictment enabled Billing, during the prosecution's
concluding argument, to deny that he had ever actually claimed Allan
was a lesbian. Throughout the six days of the trial, he allowed the
prosecution to educate the audience on lesbians and their clitorises,
thus heightening the scandalous effect. However his final disavowal of
any lesbian intent renders him innocent of leveling an unforgivable libel
against a woman, while maintaining a distinctly queer moral insinuation
against Allan and <i>Salom&eacute;.</i> Having staged a seductive scene
of reading that excites the most elaborate lesbian fantasies, Billing
can then reassert his authority and officially refuse any lesbian
reference. This disavowal, I would propose, actually consolidates
and expands the lesbian threat; its banishment from referentiality
only confirms its potential ubiquity. Without referential stability,
it flourishes in the imagination. The innominate lesbian is the re
of greatest threat precisely because she is "only" what is "read into"
the phrase "The Cult of the Clitoris." The symbolist function of "The Cult
of the Clitoris" I suggested earlier now requires reassessment to account
for Billing's belated disavowal in court. The performative absenting of
lesbian reference endows lesbianism with an even more powerful symbolic
function through its very referential negation. That is, the erasure of
lesbianism from the court record and "The Cult of the Clitoris" achieves
a more profound symbolist effect. The symbolic mode is redoubled,

<b></b>

so that the <i>absence</i> of lesbian reference acts as a re for
revealing a (national) mood or "&eacute;tat d'&acirc;me" and becomes a
<i>de</i>materialized substitute for the intangible, floating, "minute,
intricate, almost invisible" life of British anxieties in wartime.

<p>
The trial, Wilde's play, and Allan's performance then come to metaphorize,
or translate, the crisis of the war into a scene of literary and sexual
fantasy. Decadent style represents seditious codes in contrast to the
"outspoken English" of the nation; Allan's hypnotic allure is conred
as the most insidious form of traitorous influence; sexual betrayal is
mapped onto national betrayal; and the violent dismemberment of male
bodies at the front lines is reconstituted as the anatomization of
female sexual deviancy. The press reports of Billing's acquittal also
yoke together the disorder in the court and the high emotions of wartime.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
  The <i>Daily Mail</i> reports that when the "not Guilty" verdict
  was uttered



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the gallery, packed with the public rose, shouting and
'hooraying.' . . . There has never been such an excited throng in the
new Central Criminal Court, or one which gave vent to its feelings more
vociferously. In vain did the judge try to give an order to suppress the
demonstration. His lips were seen moving, but his words stood no chance
of being heard.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The voice of the law is literally struck dumb by the force of the crowd,
and as the court empties, "Outside a distant murmur of voices and a faint
cheer; inside a last hysterical giggle as a woman went and a parting
'Hooray,' deep-toned, from a soldier in hospital blue"--a scene that
conjoins feminized hysteria with national service (ibid.).

<p>
Newspaper editorials suggested that the trial functioned as a phantasmatic
substitute for the war, and even identified it as a manifestation of mass
hysteria. The <i>Times</i> wrote, "It is safe to say that no lawsuit
of modern times has attracted such universal and painful interest as
the deplorable libel action which terminated yesterday at the Central
Criminal Court"; across England "the daily reports have been read and
discussed with almost as deep anxiety as the news of the war itself."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  The <i>New Statesman</i> lamented, "A great battle is raging; armies
  are bleeding and dying; Paris is at stake; and for a week the interest
  of the British public has been almost entirely centred upon a trial
  for criminal libel."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
  According to the <i>Manchester Guardian,</i> "Even in the
  preoccupations of war-time the Pemberton Billing trial is an arresting
  London event." The reporter specifically diagnosed the public response
  to the trial as "the most extraordinary expression we have had of war
  psychology and the feverish distortion of normal beliefs," and the
  <i>New Age</i> considered the trial a demonstration of the "mob-mind."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
 In a letter to the editor of the <i>Times,</i> a Labour M. P. insisted
 that Billing's paranoid conspiracy undermined the psychic health of
 the nation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
By far the most serious aspect of the case is the effect upon the great
mass of our people, whose minds and thoughts at this moment are concerned
with the fate of their loved ones at the front. . . . Reckless assertions
. . . entirely unsupported by evidence, and defaming men and women alive
and dead, may well have a disturbing effect upon a public opinion already
racked with anxiety and tense with emotion.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Such a complaint attests to the cultural work performed by the trial. With
"loved ones" at the front engaged in a war that defied representation,
those at home witnessed a sexualized scene of strife upon which they
could displace anxiety and emotion, and the lesbian suggestion afforded a
particularly effective conduit for mediating this fantasy. Consequently,
even though a lesbian insinuation started the trial, as newspaper
commentators noted, "any issue was on trial at most times except the
one which was legally at stake."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  The trial was clearly not <i>about</i> female homosexuality; however,
  lesbianism's combination of <i>un</i>representability and potent
  suggestibility offered a sensationally effective and exquisitely
  elusive means of ring Britain's political and epistemological
  crises of modern history.

is going on in the Court of law" (<i>VR,</i> 57-8). The <i>Manchester
Guardian</i> even printed this warning from the judge, foregrounding,
like many other newspapers, the unnamable obscenity of the case. See
"Mr Pemberton Billing and Miss Maud Allan," <i>Manchester Guardian,</i>
30 May 1918. On the operations of the "open secret," see D. A. Miller's

the trial to frame her discussion of "the visibility of lesbianism in

<i>Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning: The Great War in European Cultural
History</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995) for a nuanced
argument that dissents from the notion of the war as a "radical break"
and insists on the continuities of tradition in the representation and
memorializing of the war. Notably, even though Winter strongly protests
the yoking of "modernism" (revolutionary aesthetic practices) and World
War I, he calls upon a relatively caricatured notion of modernism as a
radical break with the past that wholly disregards traditional forms of
representation. My argument attempts to strike a dialogue between the
war's simultaneous reliance and innovation upon established historical
forms.

Knightley points out that censorship of the press was imposed at the

they were strictly regulated so their reports would corroborate the

propaganda in enemy countries (Knightley, 82). On the deliberate invention

William Cohen argues that male homosexuality, the "unspeakable" crime
and most covert of sexual practices during the late Victorian period,
is the appropriate locus for an analysis of scandal, while female
homosexuality is simply beyond imagination: "While the willful effort
to deny female sexuality resulted in celebrated adultery, divorce, and
illegitimacy cases, ironically it largely precluded lesbian scandals,
which were less unspeakable than unthinkable." William Cohen, <i>Sex
Scandal: The Private Parts of Victorian Fiction</i> (Durham, N.C.:

Indeed, most major critical engagements with <i>Salom&eacute;</i> in
the last twenty years have been concerned with her sexual queerness. The
most emphatic proponents of reading Salom&eacute; as a (gay) man trapped
under transvestic veils are: Gail Finney, <i>Women in Modern Drama: Freud,
Feminism, and the European Theater at the Turn of the Century</i> (Ithaca,
N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1989); Richard Dellamora, "Traversing the

Notably, although <i>Salom&eacute;</i> clearly pays homage to symbolist
drama, the play also self-consciously ironizes the symbolist compulsion in
the very moment of enacting it. Thus, Herodias staunchly, even comically,
refuses to play the symbolist game of lunar similes with the rebuff,
"The moon is like the moon. That is all." Herod likewise ultimately
realizes that "It is not wise to find symbols in everything that
one sees. It makes life too full of terrors." <i>Salom&eacute;,</i>
in <i>The Portable Oscar Wilde,</i> ed. Richard Aldington and Stanley
Wientraub (New York: Penguin, 1981), 407, 419. In this sense, as much
as the drama exploits the symbolist compulsion, it also foregrounds its
maddening potential and keeps an ironic distance from the very paranoid
associative chains of meaning that Billing forges in 1918.

In the spring of 1913 Douglas charged Ransome with libel for his
literary biography of Wilde, which referred to the expurgated sections
of <i>De Profundis</i> and largely blamed Douglas, without naming him,
for Wilde's suffering. See Ransome, <i>Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study</i>
(New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1913). Douglas lost the case when the jury
decided that the words complained of did constitute a libel, but were
true. Notably, Justice Darling was the judge presiding over the case,
the same judge who presided over Billing's case.

In fact, "The Cult of the Clitoris" not only gestures to the "cult"
of Wilde (and the Dandy as the "cult of the self"), but also to the
cult of Sappho practiced by the all-women salons of Natalie Barney and
Ren&eacute;e Vivien or represented in Pierre Lou&yuml;s's <i>Songs of
Bilitis.</i> The phrase suggestively overlaps the decadent Sappho-revival
of Baudelaire, Lou&yuml;s, Vivien, Barney, and Swinburne with the
political reaction to the successes of the feminist movement. On the
sapphic revival in Paris, see Shari Benstock, <i>Women of the Left
Bank: Paris, 1900-1940</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986)

While the journal <i>Academy</i> published an enthusiastic review of

Mata Hari fabricated an identity as a Javanese dancer, claiming to give
authentic expression to Javanese and Indian sacred dances, which she
performed in little or no clothes. Capitalizing on the same Salomania
as Allan, Mata Hari performed her own "Dance of the Seven Veils," was
constantly compared to Salome, and urged her agent to ask Strauss to
produce a <i>Salom&eacute;</i> performance for her. Julie Wheelwright,

<p>

Mata Hari was immediately mythologized and her story exploited by war
propagandists. An example of this is Henry de Halsalle's, <i>The Life
Story of Madame Zelle, The World's Most Beautiful Spy</i> (London:
Skeffington and Sons, 1917), a sensational, fictionalized account of
Mata Hari's life as a German agent.

The First Sea Lord, Prince Louis Battenberg, whose father had been a
German prince; Lord Haldane, whose German education and diplomatic
ties made him a target of public hostility; and the vice-consul in
Rotterdam, A. G. Holzapfel, who was British-born with an unfortunate
appellation, were all forced to resign because of popular anti-alien
sentiment. See John Terraine, <i>The Impacts of War 1914 and 1918</i>
(London: Hutchinson, 1970). See also David French, "Spy Fever in Britain,
1900-1915," <i>The Historical Journal</i> 21.2 : 355-70, for a

Trevor Wilson speculates that the public, unable to dispense with its
political and military leaders at this time, displaced its anxiety onto
a renewed campaign against enemy aliens in Britain. Terraine concurs,
diagnosing a vehement hatred and righteous indignation against the Germans
as a desperate civilian attempt to combat the "flagging of the spirit
as the war dragged on," and which found its most explosive expression
in anti-alien activity. Terraine, <i>Impacts of War,</i> 177.

sedition resonates with Allied anti-German propaganda that connected
homosexuality and German moral degeneracy. Propagandist works published
during the war such as Henry de Halsalle's <i>Degenerate Germany</i>
(London: T. Werner Laurie, 1917) and de Halsalle and C. Sheridan Jones's
<i>The German Woman and Her Master</i> (London: T. Werner Laurie, 1916)
expressly aligned sexual perversity in Germany with the country's moral
degeneracy, citing in particular "the unspeakable Eulenburg affair," in
which a group of "advisers and confidants of the Emperor" were exposed
as indulging in <i>le vice allemand</i> (155-6).

Allan's position as an actress actually feeds into the lesbian
suggestion. Havelock Ellis includes the theatre along with girls'

homosexuality. Havelock Ellis and John Addington Symonds, <i>Sexual

What might be the significance that lesbianism is "nameless" and not

Here is the full passage of Williams's instructive interpretation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
[Y]ou cannot appreciate the gravity of the charge against this lady
unless you appreciate what the real meaning is of this horrible
phrase. . . . [T]he fact is that this particular part of the female
organization is open to treatment, let us say, other than by normal means
which nature intended. And, hence, there has come into this wicked world
undoubtedly a practice. . . .--recognised as a vice which is supposed
to have originated in the Island of Lesbos where there were women
and no men--a vice by which the clitoris can be excited (<i>six words
omitted</i>) and ways other than those which nature intended. And there
do exist in the world vicious practices where men are able to gratify
their passions with men, and women with women--degrading, repulsive,
contrary to nature, and consequently destructive of health--practices
which, indulged in to any extent, sap and undermine the sanity and probity
and self-respect . . . of those who indulge in them. [<i>VR,</i> 58]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The notion of the clitoris as extraneous will not only be elaborated
by Freud, but has a history stretching back to the middle ages. On
the discursive history of the clitoris, see Valerie Traub, "The
Psychomorphology of the Clitoris," <i>Gay and Lesbian Quarterly</i>
2 : 81-113 and Thomas W. Laqueur, "Amor Veneris, vel Dulcedo
Appeletur" in <i>Fragments for a History of the Human Body, Part
Three,</i> ed. Romona Naddaff and Nadia Tazi (New York: Zone, 1989),
90-131.

<p>
<a name="FOOT42" href="#REF42">42</a>.
Notably, the <i>Verbatim Report</i> makes a point of omitting the
"sixty-one words" in which "The learned counsel explained in a very
clear manner the precise situation and function of the clitoris" and
also "six words" in which he explains how the clitoris can be excited
(57, 58). It seems worthwhile to note that Marie Stopes's <i>Married
Love</i> was first published at the end of March 1918, reviews of
which can be sometimes found alongside editorials about the Billing
trial. An accessible and immmensely popular book for the lay public
on sexuality, it proposed the ground-breaking argument that sexual
knowledge, education, and instruction were all necessary for a healthy
marriage. Stopes explicitly and simply explained the importance of the
clitoris for female pleasure and argued vehemently for the benefits of
female sexual satisfaction (beyond reproduction). The trial, then, is
poised at, and contributesto, a revolutionary moment in the knowledge
of female body parts and conrations of female sexuality.

Billing's defense at the police trial had been that his libel could
not have posed a threat to public order, as only the "initiated" or
medical experts would understand the meaning of the phrase. Either the
understanding reader would already be corrupted, or would be a medical
expert, and thus incorruptible (<i>SLV,</i> 20).

<p>
<a name="FOOT48" href="#REF48">48</a>.
<i>VR,</i> 84-5. Jennifer Travis similarly points out how Billing
tried to use Allan's knowledge of terms as "sadism" to prove her sexual
immorality. See "Clits in Court."

<p>
<a name="FOOT49" href="#REF49">49</a>.
One of Allan's repeated tactics for deflecting a sexual reading is an
appeal to orientalism, so that Wilde's curious phrases, such as "gilded
tigers," are shifted from the language of sexuality to the language of the
East; it is the authenticity of Wilde's orientalizing play that accounts
for its indecipherability and which an ignorant reader might misconstrue
as sexual. Allan thus attempts to intervene another "expert" position, one
of cultural and artistic knowledge, to cleanse the play of inherent sexual
transgression and consign Billing's reading to prurient scandal-mongering.

My thanks to Natalie Melas for pointing out this relationship.

<p>
<a name="FOOT52" href="#REF52">52</a>.
<i>VR,</i> 249. Hoare briefly cites some of this exchange and claims,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The exchange between Billing and Cooke rehashed all the old shibboleths
of the Wildean era; only now, prejudice masqueraded as pseudo-medical
'evidence.' It was the barely cloaked philistinism of an age whose
cultural horizons were foreshortened by war and desperate blind
patriotism. In 1918--nearly two decades into the twentieth century and
the modern era--these words were a direct reversion to Victorian values
and hypocrisy. [Hoare, <i>Oscar Wilde's Last Stand,</i> 145]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
I am arguing that we cannot dismiss such exchanges, as blatantly
outrageous as they appear now, as simply philistinism. The concern
with modes of reading seems a crucial context for the trial's ability to
connect issues of artistic practices, national security, sexual practices,
and moral codes.

<p>
<a name="FOOT53" href="#REF53">53</a>.
Cooke's exchange with Billing regarding sex perverts who "describe as
beautiful and glorious all their perversions," particularly when in
a courtroom, seems to be referencing Wilde's elegant account of "The
Love that dare not speak its name" in his own criminal proceedings. For
Wilde's speech, see H. Montgomery Hyde's <i>The Trials of Oscar Wilde</i>
(New York: Dover Publications, 1962), 256.

<p>
<a name="FOOT54" href="#REF54">54</a>.
That the unimaginable experiences of war at the front found an analogue in
Billing's trial is graphically suggested by the press's juxtaposition of
photographs and reports of the trial alongside maps of the battles at the
front. See for example, the <i>Daily Mail,</i> 1 June 1918, where a photo
of witnesses "who have given remarkable evidence in the Billing trial"
is positioned directly under a map of the front and the photo headline
"Huns Gain in France and Flanders." The <i>Times</i>' report of the
trial on 3 June, "Mr. Billing's Trial," frames a map of "Great Battles
Between the Oise and the Marne," while the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>'s
report of the "Frantic Demonstrations" at Billing's acquittal borders
a map of the front lines. The <i>Daily Mail</i>'s photo of the crowd
cheering Billing's acquittal appears directly beside a photo of "The
War Council of Versailles," with a photo headline that links the two:
"Billing Trial--After the Acquittal. Versailles Council."

In the classic scene of male bonding from the great novel of World War I,
<i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>, Paul Baumer and his comrade, Kat,
prepare a meal and find themselves sharing "a more complete communion
. . . than even lovers have."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  As Jane Marcus asserts, Remarque's enormously influential novel
  (translated into English in 1929) changed the perception "of war
  fictions roughly from epic invocations of individual heroism to
  initiations into brotherhood."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  Further, Samuel Hynes declares that

<b></b>

in the late 1920s and early 1930s, "the classic war books were published"
and "the Myth of the War was defined and fixed in the version that still
retains authority."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  At the center of this myth is the idea that the "experience of battle
  was incommunicable" to those outside the "exclusive, quasi-mystical
  fellowship" of men who had seen action.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  Written primarily by gentleman officers and middle-class soldiers,
  the war "classics" describe British soldiers as innocent victims,
  sacrificed by callous old men and especially by the women they were
  supposed to protect. In this familiar narrative the camaraderie between
  soldiers overcomes regional and class divisions, providing solace
  amidst the madness and horror. And while such love often produced
  passionate, homoerotic descriptions, critics have generally followed
  Paul Fussell's lead in perceiving homosexual desire at the front as
  resembling "the 'idealistic,' passionate, but non-physical crushes
  which most officers had experienced at public school."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
A little-known war story by a working-class Irish veteran challenges
the canonical version of what happened between men in World War I.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  Privately published in 1930 and out of print for decades before its
  reissue in 1997, James Hanley's "The German Prisoner" undermines
  the idea of British soldiers as innocent victims, showing rather
  how the war machine exploits class divisions, misogyny, homophobia,
  and repressed homosexual desire, inciting soldiers to the vicious
  slaughter of other men. "The German Prisoner" describes in graphic
  detail how O'Garra and Elston, two Tommies lost in "the fog of war,"
  take mutual pleasure from beating, torturing, raping, and murdering an
  enemy who has surrendered to them. The narrative culminates in their
  destruction when a shell blows them into the muck as they grapple
  together in a murderous paroxysm of desire. Despite its disturbing
  resemblance to postwar narratives that glorify an aesthetic of
  violence, Hanley's story exposes and indicts rather than celebrates
  theculture of war through its emphasis on the release of repressed
  desire through atrocity.

<p>
"The German Prisoner" speaks the language of the trenches--the language
of bodies at war--and provides a rare glimpse of killing's emotional
charge. Challenging the myth of the war's indescribability, Fussell
insists that the English language could "perfectly well render the
actuality of trench warfare," offering as proof a list that includes
terms and phrases such as "<i>blood, terror, agony, madness, shit,
cruelty, murder, . . . screaming all night, bleeding to death from the
rectum,</i> and the like" (<i>GWM,</i> 170). Censorship and propaganda,
however, sought to hide the truth about the war, silencing bodies in pain
for the sake of "public decency." Hanley's story comes closer than most
to communicating the horror and torture that British soldiers suffered
and inflicted upon others during the war--too close, in fact, for the
comfort of the state. Written at a time when Europe was already uneasily
contemplating its next war, "The German Prisoner" describes a war crime
involving sexually aroused British soldiers who horribly mutilate and
violate the helpless body of their German enemy. Citing obscenity laws,
the government burned every copy of this dangerous story it could find
in 1933.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
During the war, military training and anti-German propaganda strove to
make men better soldiers both by encouraging homoeroticism among the
troops and, paradoxically, by projecting homophobia onto the enemy. As
Eric Leed cautions, understanding

<b></b>

the war experience requires not merely balancing "its undeniably positive
and negative features," but recognizing "how both the positive and
negative sides of the war are emanations of the same phenomenon."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Accordingly, Joanna Bourke points out that while the development
  of intimate male friendships made the war "less unbearable and more
  human . . . male bonding was not [exclusively] an inevitable, organic
  sentiment of the war: it was in the interests of military authorities
  to foster in servicemen a sense of group solidarity."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  Indeed, the military discouraged male bonding when it interfered
  with the war effort. Following the legendary Christmas Day truce
  of 1914, during which men from both sides of the conflict created
  a temporary domestic space by singing carols, sharing food, and
  exchanging souvenirs, "stringent regulations were immediately issued
  to prevent it from happening again, and the whole system of military
  justice was brought into play."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  The proper lesson to learn from Christmas was not universal
  brotherhood, the military urged, but "redemption through suffering,"
  which would "make men hard" (ibid.).

<p>
Even as soldiers were encouraged to make themselves hard, they
simultaneously learned to mark the enemy as feminine and sexually
deviant. Recent feminist scholarship perceives war as a "gendering
activity that ritually marks the gender" of all its participants,
whether combatant or civilian.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  During World War I, the British gender system extended the binary
  opposition of masculine/feminine to battlefront/homefront and
  soldier/enemy as part of an overall pattern of control. The reality
  of trench warfare--where men cowered helplessly below the earth at the
  mercy of shells exploding above them--provoked a crisis of masculinity
  evident not just in "a generalized sexual anxiety" but also, as Sandra
  Gilbert observes, in "a sexual anger directed specifically against"
  the feminine.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Demonization of the enemy operated as a vital mechanism for the war's
  continuance: killing without remorse and maintaining aggression in an
  essentially defensive war required combatants to un-recognize their
  German opponent, to identify him as not-man and bond together as men
  in pursuit of his destruction. Thus, as Claire Tylee concludes, by
  valorizing heroic sacrifice and tragic martyrdom, the dominant myths
  of World War I gloss over the army's manipulation of masculine ideals
  in order to drive men to their maximum killing potential (<i>GW,</i>
  254-5). "The German Prisoner" reminds us why men are sent to war--to
  kill and maim each other--demonstrating how ethnic and class divisions,
  homophobia, and misogyny help make this carnage possible.

Empire, Class, and "The German Prisoner"
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Foregrounding the hostility and alienation of British imperial society,
James Hanley's proletarian Irish perspective challenges the myth of
a collective loss of innocence that suffuses officers' memoirs and
continues to dominate cultural memory. Many soldiers experienced and
remembered World War I as being profoundly influenced by their ethnicity
and class status. Britain in 1914 was a nation troubled by the appalling
conditions of urban slums, suffragist challenges to patriarchy, threats
of strikes at home, and imminent civil war in Ireland. As Tylee points
out, the "prelapsarian fantasy" of a prewar,

<b></b>

unified nation reflecting British nostalgia for an idealized childhood
and "lost imperial splendor" is specific to the upper-class English male
(<i>GW,</i> 245). In Sassoon's <i>Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man,</i>
Rebecca West finds a "heartrending portrait of a class that was allowed
to play at being children until the war came, and then was delivered,
bound hand and foot, to the forces of hell."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  Hanley's life and fiction, however, provide a powerful corrective
  to the notion that prewar Britain nurtured innocence and idealism
  in all its youth. His 1931 novel, <i>Boy</i>--in which a cabin boy
  is repeatedly molested by older men, infected with syphilis in an
  Alexandrian brothel, and then tossed overboard like garbage--describes
  a hellish alternative to Sassoon's extended adolescence.

<p>
Born in Dublin , Hanley spent most of his childhood in an immigrant
community in Liverpool before going to sea at the age of thirteen to
serve as a ship's boy. Whatever his experiences were at sea, combat
apparently offered a more attractive alternative. Deserting ship in New
Brunswick, he lied about his age and signed up with the Canadian army,
eventually serving with shock troops in France.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  After being discharged with injuries sustained in a gas attack, Hanley
  returned to Liverpool, where he struggled for years against poverty,
  working, among other menial jobs, as a docker and racetrack cashier.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Hanley thus describes the war from the perspective of a working-class
  soldier who experiences the dehumanization of the trenches as an
  intensification of, rather than a radical departure from, his position
  in society.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
"The German Prisoner" opens as a battalion of men from Dublin, Cork,
Donegal, and England's industrial slums hunker down for a night in a
bombed-out house that resembles a stable. Treated like animals, the men
behave and smell accordingly. They attack their food with "savagery"
and fill the rooms with their sweat and "their almost pesty breath"
("GP," 7). Within this bestiary, two huddle apart. Hanley makes clear
the closeted nature of their relationship when he writes, "In the darkest
corner of one of the rooms on the ground floor lay two men . . . facing
each other" in a "recumbent position" (ibid.). The taller and heavier
of the men, Peter O'Garra, is Irish, impoverished, and inverted--on
the ladder of the British Empire you can't descend much lower than
this. O'Garra's companion, Elston, is also working-class. Born in the
slums of Manchester, and described by O'Garra as the "suck-holing type,"
he occupies a position only fractionally better. Parodying the officers'
familiar sentimentality, Elston misses the "smoke and fog and grease"
of his home and feels nostalgic for his "little corner of the world,"
filthy and rotten though it may be. O'Garra, by contrast, harbors
no regrets for the "drab life of Tara Street," with "its lousiness,
its human animals herded together, its stinkin' mattresses" ("GP,"
9). During World War I, Dublin boasted the worst slums in Europe, with
one-third of its population crammed into single rooms that housed up
to twenty people who slept as many as eight in a bed. Such conditions
bred a tuberculosis rate twice as high as London's. It is therefore not
surprising that Dublin,which also manifested the highest death rate and
greatest percentage of people living in poverty of any city in the United
Kingdom, inspired little nostalgia in those who left.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  Further, Dubliners who migrated to English cities such as Liverpool
  often found themselves isolated in pockets of Irish abjection,
  reliving the circumstances they had fled.

<b></b>

<p>
Britain's justification of imperialism as a civilizing mission
necessitated by the colonial subject's primitivism was fine-tuned in
Ireland; and for the Irish who came to work in England, class antagonisms
fused with ethnic stereotyping.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  The discourse of British racial superiority required the Irish male
  to be less than a man, whether in Matthew Arnold's well-intentioned
  celebration of the feminine qualities of the Celt or in the vicious
  satires of <i>Punch.</i> One such satire, entitled "The Missing Link,"
  detailed how explorers venturing into "the lowest districts of London
  and Liverpool" would encounter "the lowest species of Irish Yahoo
  . . . a climbing animal . . . ascending a ladder laden with a hod
  of bricks," ready to attack "civilised beings that have provoked
  its fury."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  During the war, both the arrival of a German ship on the Irish coast
  and the Easter Rising  confirmed fears of Irish treachery and
  violence. And the identification of the Irish enemy with sexual
  deviance was simultaneously reinforced by the execution of Roger
  Casement for treason  following the revelation of scandalous
  diaries containing evidence of homosexual encounters throughout the
  colonies. According to Enda Duffy, Casement's "rebellious patriotic
  martyrdom" was thereby "transformed by insinuation into a discourse of
  forbidden sexuality," and his "choice of political action" reduced to
  "the merely predictable expression of an inner secret."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
Given the wartime association of the Irish with treason, sexual deviance,
and subhumanity, it is easy to see why Hanley rejected the "known literary
forms" that Fussell insists war writers could not avoid (<i>GWM,</i>
174). Rather, Hanley's war memoir bypasses the mythic chivalry of English
national literature for the idiom of jingoistic, working-class humor he
had internalized from British satires of the Irish people's attempts to
overcome biology. There is much of the "stage Irishman" about O'Garra
(whose very name has echoes of "begorra," an expression prominent in
Irish theater), and indeed, at times, Hanley appears to be writing stage
directions rather than description.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  O'Garra spits on the floor, "following up the action by drawing the
  flat of his hand across his mouth" ("GP," 8). As the troops prepare
  to move out, O'Garra and Elston execute a pratfall straight from the
  music hall:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Suddenly O'Garra slipped into a hole.
<br />
"Jesus Christ! Already," growled Elston.
<br />
He dragged O'Garra out, following up the action by falling in
himself. ["GP,"11]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Such exaggerated actions emphasize the absurdity of the humiliating and
degrading role they must perform in order to survive. There is no touch of
elegy, no sense of sacrifice in Hanley's description of battle, which he
records with darkly physical humor. A sergeant named Grundy announces his
intention to "post certain men," provoking "all and sundry" to break into
"loud cursing and obscene oaths" ("GP," 17). Brains belonging to a soldier
named Gorman end up splattered on O'Garra's forehead. And in another scene
Elston screams "like a stuck pig" on finding himself "drenched in blood":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"Oh funkin' hell. I'm killed. I'm dead. O'Garra. O'Garra. O'Garra."
<br />
"Shut up," growled the Irishman. "Can't you see that bugger behind
you. You got a belt in the back with his head. See. He hasn't any
now. That whizz-bang took his head and his arse off him at the same
time. . . ." ["GP," 19]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The voices Hanley records with such accuracy in "The German Prisoner"
are those from "the end of the line," the lowest level of combat troops,
lacking either agency or access to information about their fate.

<p>
Joanna Bourke notes that "the ideology of male comradeship in war
was never intended to subvert military rank and its association with
socioeconomic class"; at the height of the battle the men do their job,
which is not to think, but to move forward, to follow orders (<i>DM,</i>
145). They form a corporate body, a "huge eyeless monster that forge[s]
its way ahead towards some inevitable destiny. Nothing more" ("GP,"
12). At times, however, the mass disintegrates into its constituent
parts. One memorable scene from "The German Prisoner" deflates the
classic war texts' romanticization of the officer's relationship to
his men. Knowing that a guide waits for them a thousand yards ahead,
an officer worries about his men for strategic reasons alone: some
might die, yes, but to leave them out in the open would "disclose (more
importantly) the movements of troops . . . to the Germans" and ruin the
element of surprise ("GP," 14). "Far back, at the very tail end of this
file of men," Elston and O'Garra have been worrying about the officer's
competence, complaining that "that bugger in front" can't re out what
to do. As the cover of darkness lifts, the men begin to panic--"what
had merely been a germ, became a disease, an epidemic. The torment
was no longer private, but general. . . . When something went wrong,
the more sensitive spirits became agitated. One saw it in their eyes"
("GP," 15). After a bombardment kills seven men, the troops issue their
own orders: "RUN FOR IT" ("GP," 16).

<p>
As John Keegan shows, the average soldier answers to a different
imperative than the officer: "the concepts 'win' and 'lose' through
which a commander . . . approach[es] a battle are by no means the same
as those through which his men will view their own involvement in it."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  Studies of human behavior in combat reveal that men identify themselves
  in terms of a "very tiny" group, "perhaps no more than six or seven
  men." Group members begin to t and continue to t for two
  reasons: "personal survival, which individuals will recognize to be
  bound up with group survival" and the "fear of incurring by cowardly
  conduct the group's contempt."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Further, noting the "immense burden" masculine comradeship placed on
 men "to express martial values," Bourke observes that in World War I,
 "the fear of being thought to be a coward was intense" (<i>DM,</i>
 151-2). Tylee adds that to feel fear provoked deep shame in a man,
 causing him to "despise himself as he might a member of an 'inferior'
 race or a girl" (<i>GW,</i> 125). Masculinity taught men to repress
 fear of the other within, thereby directing shame and self-loathing
 into aggression against a designated object outside themselves.

<p>
Of the two men, O'Garra seems to be the better soldier, having learned
the masculine ability to maintain control over himself and other men. He
brags about surviving the first gas attack, and he repeatedly pulls
Elston out of danger as the other man whimpers for his mother.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  Years of abuse on a filthy street in the most despised corner of the
  British Empire have steeled O'Garra against attacks. The litany of
  insults with which his Dublin neighbors revile him constitutes the same
  equation between homosexuality and treason found in British propaganda:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
a lousy bugger--a rake--a closet--a quiet fellow--a tub of guts--a
pimp--a shit-house--a toad--a sucker--a blasted sod--a Holy Roller--a Tara
lemon--a Judas--a jumped-up liar--a book-worm--a traitor to Ireland--a
pervert--an Irish jew--an Irish Christ--a clod. ["GP," 8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite their rejection of him as "a traitor to Ireland," O'Garra's
countrymen uphold British associations of Ireland with deviance, using
"Irish" and "Tara" as intensifiers of their own scorn. Demonized as a
pervert, an animal, and a traitor to race and religion, O'Garra seeks
in aggression a more acceptable alternative to this identity. We learn
that he "went for a soldier" to keep from giving in to "blood" that was
"heavy with surrender" ("GP," 9). War is just "blood bitterness," he
tells Elston, "and bitter blood is good blood" (ibid.). This struggle
has taken its toll, however. His eyes, which Hanley compares to "the
dried up beds of African lakes," reveal the double repression of his
identity as racialized colonial subject and as sexual other.

<p>
O'Garra has so internalized society's prejudices that he can't open his
mouth without a disparaging remark about "buggers" and "sods." Self-hatred
translates his attraction to Elston as hate at first sight: "When first he
had set eyes on Elston, he had despised him, there was something in this
man utterly repugnant to him" ("GP," 10). From his first encounter with
this "human rat," this Englishman of the "suck-holing type," O'Garra
obsesses about how despicable he finds the other man, penning verses
that testify to Elston's uniqueness as an object of scorn.



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Annihilating Desire
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
A cultural complex of homophobia, misogyny, racial and class
discrimination, and repressed sexual desire erupt into violence and
brutality in the relationship between O'Garra and Elston, provoking their
rape and murder of a German prisoner. The anxiety shared by cultural
historians over pronounced homoeroticism in literary representations
of the war is exemplified by Fussell's coining of the phrase "chaste
homosexuality" to bolster his claim that virtually <i>none</i> of
these crushes were ever consummated. In fact, between 1914 and 1919,
"twenty-two officers and 270 other ranks were court-martialed for
'indecency' with another man."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  Reminding us that "the war provided opportunities for erotic
  relationships among men which were not necessarily available in
  peacetime," Trudi Tate suggests we examine <i>why</i> the idea of
  homosexuality has been so obdurately resisted.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  Certainly the identification during and after the war of homosexuality
  as a <i>German</i> practice provided an added incentive for men to
  remain silent about their own behavior: newspapers condemned infection
  by "German homosexuality" as threatening "the patriotism, stamina,
  intellect and morale" of the troops.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
In "The German Prisoner," however, the fog of war is also the fog of
desire, even if O'Garra and Elston consistently misname and misrecognize
their passion. The lid is clamped down so tightly that neither can
envision the realization of his desire without an eruption of violence. As
the troops "go over the top" into no-man's-land,

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
every sound and every movement seemed to strike a responsive chord in the
Irishman's nature. He hung on desperately to the Manchester man. . . . He
could not understand this sudden desire for Elston's company. But the
desire overwhelmed him. ["GP," 19]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Something about battle turns O'Garra on. Seeing a once-foolish officer's
"headless body" stirs "something deep down in the bosom of his soul"
("GP," 28). After they lose contact with their battalion, the fog deepens
and Elston regards O'Garra with "a sudden gust of fear and passion,"
wondering "did this man really mean to murder him" ("GP," 22).

<p>
When O'Garra looks "across at the huddled form of the Manchester man,"
he heaves a sigh, acknowledging, but still unable to articulate, his
yearning: "Now the whole of his past shot across the surface of that mind"
(ibid.). Remembering "those lonely nights, those fruitless endeavors"
spent searching for a woman, O'Garra concludes, "surely they took on
a richer texture now. . . . [A]chieved a certain significance" ("GP,"
22-3). He defers his sexual confusion with a deep meditation on what
will happen after the war. Unable to re out why he "had come into all
this muck and mud and madness," he gropes instead for a suitable target
for the grudge he believes "everyone in the war must bear," wondering
"would they all demand retribution? Would they all wreak a terrible
vengeance?" ("GP," 23).

<p>
Waking from this reverie, O'Garra realizes that his watch has stopped,
imparting to the scene the strange, surrealistic quality of a dream
sequence. Suddenly, out of the mist emerges a handsome German soldier
boy embodying the homoerotic ideal described by classic war memoirs.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  Hanley invokes him lyrically, as "tall, with a form as graceful as
  a young sapling," with hair "as fair as ripe corn, . . . blue eyes,
  and finely molded features" ("GP," 24). In the ensuing brutal scene,
  "The German Soldier" enacts the men's projection of unsafe desire on
  an enemy who must consequently be destroyed.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  Calling out repeatedly, "Camerade. Camerade," the German boy pleads
  for recognition of their common humanity. Initially Elston recognizes
  this appeal, responding that they too are lost and asking, "Is it
  foggy where you came from? . . . [W]e'll never get out of this hole,
  only by stirring ourselves together and making a bolt for it" ("GP,"
  25). O'Garra, however, chokes off the possibility of fellowship with
  a torrent of homophobic slurs, warning Elston, "perhaps this sod is
  leading us into a trap. Why not finish the bugger off, anyhow?" In the
  fog of war, innocence provokes violence, and murder reveals its erotic
  potential. O'Garra and Elston savagely kick the screaming prisoner's
  face into a bloody pulp. The remorse and horror they feel afterwards
  ends quickly. Reminiscing about an earlier incident, in which O'Garra
  pulled another soldier off an old woman during what appears to have
  been a serial rape, the two excitedly urinate over the prisoner. And
  their subsequent expressions of renewed vigor are clearly postcoital:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"Hell!" exclaimed O'Garra. "After that I feel relieved. Refreshed. Don't
feel tired. Don't feel anything particularly. How do you feel?" he asked.
<br />
"The same," replied Elston. "But I wish to Christ this soddin' fog would
lift." ["GP," 30]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The world of "The German Prisoner" is liquid with water, blood, tears,
urine, and fog, evoking a dissolution of control and leaking across
borders associated with a pronounced anxiety toward the feminine. Elston
and O'Garra experience desire as "a ceaseless yearning, the restlessness
of waters washing against the floodgates of the soul" (ibid.). O'Garra
kicks the German savagely in the face, and seeing "the stream of blood
gush forth from the German's mouth," he bursts "into tears" ("GP,"
27). Elston spits in the face of the German, whose own saliva will
trickle down his chin later as he cowers in the hole ("GP," 25-6). The
German prisoner seems almost entirely fluid--and feminine. He weeps;
he calls out repeatedly for water; his sigh has a "liquidity of tone";
he reminds Elston of "all the beauty and music and rhythm of the Rhine";
and he seems ready to dissolve at any time into the mud ("GP," 31-2). The
battlefield is also fluid, resembling a cosmic whirlpool--a vast, primal,
devouring mother. In the heat of battle, "the earth was alive--afire. The
earth was a mouth, it was a sea, a yawning gulf, a huge maw" ("GP,"
19). Terms like "mouth, gulf, and maw" resonate with the threat of female
genitalia. Indeed, O'Garra's own mouth suggests the monstrous feminine:
"If one wished to know O'Garra, one looked at his mouth," the narrator
comments ("GP," 9). O'Garra's mouth makes him "more than a man" and the
false teeth clicking in his "ugly mouth" elicit a castrating potential,
a vagina dentata ("GP," 8).

<p>
Desire in "The German Prisoner" expresses itself as contamination,
pollution, threat: "There is a peculiar power about rottenness," Hanley
insists, and O'Garra feels himself helpless before Elston's peculiar
power. As their anxiety increases and they escalate their torture of the
prisoner, the Tommies vent their "unclean" feelings through repeated
references to defecation. In an obvious request for anal sex, Elston
growls at O'Garra: "My <i>arse</i> on you. . . . Let's worry each other
to death. Isn't that better than sitting here like soft shits. That time I
fell asleep I did it in my pants" ("GP," 33). Elston calls O'Garra a "big
shit house" as they stare at each other, transfixed with desire and rage
("GP," 35). Seeing the mangled body of the prisoner sink beneath the mud,
O'Garra screams out, "I hate this thing so much I want to shite on it"
("GP," 36). Noting that "sexual fantasies played a large role in wartime
propaganda," Mosse describes the "vogue" in Germany for "scatological
postcards, uncensored because the fantasies were projected onto the
enemy, depicted as covered with excrement, their bodies and even sexual
organs exposed."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  In Hanley's story, the abject body of the prisoner functions similarly
  as a field upon which both murderous aggression and transgressive
  desire can be projected and commingled.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
The body of the German prisoner offers an acceptable outlet for the
British soldiers' rage against their own victimization by a classist
society. Their problems are not with any particular "Jerry" so much
as with a society that considers them filth because of their class,
race, or sexuality and sends them off to war to die. As he torments the
prisoner, Elston asks him, "Why should you not suffer as well as us?" then
repeats the words of his persecutor, Sargent Grundy--"Shit on you"
("GP," 25). Moreover, according to Eric Leed, such behavior announces
the success of Elston's military training, in which the officer treats
the recruit "the same way that he wants the soldier to treat the enemy
in battle. To escape the low and painful status of victim," the soldier

<b></b>

must identify with the aggressor. Such identification enables "the
soldier's activity in war--all the shooting, maiming, and killing--to
be perceived as moral, legitimate, and meaningful."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 The complex system of division by which society operates becomes
 intensified in wartime, firmly fixing categories of good and
 evil. Because O'Garra and Elston do not initially blame the German
 prisoner for their predicament, we can see how "evil" is constructed
 and what it takes to assume the mantle of aggressor.

<p>
The men's increasing desire for each other provokes a corresponding
intensification of their denunciations against the prisoner. Initially
O'Garra condemns Elston for losing them in the fog, insisting that "its
you and not this bloody Jerry who is responsible" ("GP," 26). When the
German's sigh interrupts O'Garra's invective against Elston, O'Garra
begins to refocus his rage, accusing the prisoner of being "as much to
blame as anybody" ("GP," 27). Finally, he and Elston, far gone in their
mutual seduction, decide that "That bastard lying there is the cause of
all this," thus allowing them to transfer anxiety over illicit emotions
to a safe object ("GP," 30). As soldiers, they have been taught to view
the German as an acceptable target of violence and to consider murder
as less transgressive than sex with another man.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Klaus Theweleit's analysis of narratives by the Friekorps--the "white
troops" who graduated from postwar persecution of communists to the elite
ranks of Hitler's S. S.--attempts to uncover systems of desire driving
cultures of war and violence. He argues that versions of masculinity
compel mastery of the body (sometimes through torture) to produce
hardness and a destructive edge. Giving in to the female signifies
"being swallowed, engulfed, annihilated. Women's bodies are the holes,
swamps, pits of muck that can engulf."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  The troops thus conceive their violence against women as
  "self-defense," a preemptive strike against a "threatening element,"
  with the affective mode of such defense being "<i>fear</i> and
  <i>desire</i>" (<i>MF,</i> 183; italics in original).

<p>
"The German Prisoner" describes a similarly violent acting out of a
simultaneously sexual and homicidal conflict. The feminine--including
the enemy soldier--is marked as deviant and threatening, and must be
destroyed. Accordingly, O'Garra and Elston objectify the German man as a
"body," an "it": "With peculiar movements of the hands" they begin to
"mangle the body" and to worry "it like mad dogs" ("GP," 32). Contact
with the "youth's soft skin" and "the velvety touch of the flesh" leave
Elston "infuriated," "demented," and "maddened" (ibid.). O'Garra and
Elston use this body to bridge the gap of their repressed homosexual
desire, relieving the pressure they feel by penetrating and puncturing
the boy. O'Garra sticks his bayonet "up the youth's anus" and both
insert a horse hair into his penis. Describing violent erotic murder
by the Freikorps as "two male compulsions . . . tearing at the woman,"
Theweleit explains, "the man pushes the woman far away (takes her life),
and gets very close to her (penetrates her with a bullet, stab wound,
club, etc.)" (<i>MF,</i> 196). Once she has been reduced to a bloody mass,
losing her "identity as an object with concrete dimensions and a unique
name," the man can breathe a sigh of relief. . . .What we are dealing
with here is the dissolution of the body itself, and of the woman as
bodily entity as well as love object" (ibid.).

<p>
O'Garra and Elston, however, will not "breathe a sigh of relief" at the
death of the boy, for the feminine also includes parts of themselves in
conflict with rigidly structured

<b></b>

ideals of masculinity that can be neither externalized nor destroyed. The
bloody body of the boy operates successively as an impediment to the
murderous rage and desire they feel for each other. The two decide to
"bury this thing. . . . If we don't destroy him, he'll destroy us,
even though he's dead" ("GP," 35). They "bury" the body by jumping
up and down on it, trampling it beneath the mud, just as O'Garra has
seen a Dublin woman trample a dog. Once the prisoner is gone, "their
very beings" seem "to burst into flame," and they realize "there is
no way out" ("GP," 36). They hurl themselves together, not realizing
that the fog has lifted enough to reveal their position. After the
smoke from an incoming shell has cleared, O'Garra can be seen with
"tortured features," his eyes "gouged out, whilst beneath his powerful
frame" lies "the remains of Elston" (ibid.). The pair is visible "for
a moment only" before they sink into a common grave with their victim,
"beneath the sea of mud" oozing "over them like the restless tide of
an everlasting night" (ibid.).

<p>
According to Tim O'Brien, if you feel at the end of a war story that
"some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste,
then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  Indeed, we see such a salvage operation in the "Introductory Note"
  to "The German Prisoner," written by Richard Aldington, author
  of war memoirs and the celebrated novel, <i>Death of a Hero.</i>
  Praising Hanley for the "force and vitality" with which he depicts
  "the unspeakable wrong . . . worked upon human souls by those who
  are supposed to be its guardians and guides," Aldington reconstructs
  O'Garra and Elston as suffering innocents who are "driven" and
  "tortured" to madness. Rounding up the usual suspects--old men and
  women distributing white feathers--Aldington rebuffs their objections
  to the "dreadfully dirty words" these characters use: "If you were
  not ashamed to send men into the war, why should you blush to read
  what they said in it? . . . Though the world will little note nor
  long remember what they did there, perhaps it will not hurt you to
  know a little of what they said and suffered."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  In his insistence on what the men "said" and "suffered," Aldington
  himself seems to have difficulty remembering "what they did there." By
  refusing to acknowledge that they are rapists and murderers, Aldington
  recuperates a fantasy of sacrificial victims purified through suffering
  that works to perpetuate the mythology of war.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
English military cemeteries of World War I are designed around a Cross
of Sacrifice and a Stone of Remembrance hewn in the shape of an altar,
projecting a Christian symbolism over rows and rows of identical graves
and headstones whose uniformity is "reminiscent of wartime camaraderie."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  Refusing such standard issue commemoration, Hanley chooses to remember
  the fallen differently. While in Hanley's description of O'Garra's
  disgust for his victim--"Everything I look at becomes Him. Everything
  Him"--the capitalized pronoun links the suffering of the German
  prisoner with the suffering of Christ, the re of Christ has been
  "plastered in shite" after "a five-nine landed behind it," pitching it
  "into one of the latrines" ("GP," 35, 13). Roadside crosses remind
  O'Garra of "the Irish Christ. All blood and tears," and he refuses
  to look at them, perhaps remembering his own persecution as an "Irish
  Christ" as well as a "shit house" ("GP," 13, 8). By establishing the
  connection between Peter O'Garra, Otto

<b></b>

from Muenchen, and Jesus Christ, and by heaping them with shit, Hanley
exposes the inevitable degradation of every person and every ideal that
participates in the obscenity of war and forecloses the possibility of
meaningful sacrifice.

<p>
"The German Prisoner" has been suppressed and ignored because its story
of men achieving pleasure in brutality, murder, and self-destruction does
not represent the way people have wanted to remember the war. According to
the dominant narrative, only two legitimate manifestations of masculinity
existed during World War I--heterosexuality and violence. Manliness
required repeated acts of courage (violence) to "prove" heterosexuality,
which nevertheless remained always in doubt. The myth that the love
between men was limited to a transcendent, "chaste" homoeroticism
sentimentalizes the compulsory heterosexuality behind an extreme form of
masculinity that channels desire, rage, and fear into the savage murder
of other men in battle. Comradeship in "The German Prisoner" cannot be
separated from the horror of war because it is an essential ingredient of
that horror. Hanley's profoundly disturbing memory of World War I raises
powerful questions about the cost of unity during violent conflicts.

Although Hanley's work is little known today and his novels are
largely out of print, his more famous contemporaries held his work in
high regard. William Faulkner lauded Hanley's originality and style,
calling his work, "not British, not American. . . . Just language
like a good, clean cyclone." Frank G. Harrington, <i>James Hanley: A
Bold and Unique Solitary</i> (Francestown, N.H.: Typographeum, 1989),
10. Calling him "a powerful writer," Alfred A. Knopf deemed Hanley's work
"genuinely important." Linnea Gibbs, <i>James Hanley: A Bibliography</i>
(Vancouver: William Hoffer, 1980), 128. In his introduction to the reissue
of <i>Boy</i> (the novel confiscated and burned for obscenity along with
"The German Prisoner"), Anthony Burgess remarks, "The geniuses who are
neglected are usually the geniuses who disturb, and we do not like to be
disturbed." James Hanley, <i>Boy</i> (London: Deutsch, 1990), vii. That
Hanley was popularly regarded as a writer of some eminence is further
illustrated by the title to his 1985 obituary in the <i>Times,</i>
"The Neglected Genius of the Novel."

Published during a boom in writing about World War I, "The German
Prisoner" represents both an important document of wartime trauma and a
powerful expression of postwar anxieties, particularly those suffered by
the working-class veteran. "The German Prisoner" shares with Hanley's
other work from the early 1930s (the eleven texts published between
1930 and 1934 that earned him the designation of proletarian writer)
the theme of the individual in the throes of overwhelming extremity,
often inflicted by brutal male authority res--employers, priests,
teachers, fathers. Particularly compelling are Hanley's depictions of
masculinity within the working-class immigrant family, as men who are
brutally oppressed by other men struggle to preserve authority within
their own homes.

Arguing that the disillusionment of the bourgeois volunteer constituted a
"militarized proletarianization," Eric Leed observes that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
in their reaction to the work-war, their resignation to meaningless,
boring, endless, and dangerous jobs, many of the uniformed upper
and middle classes took on the bitterness and resentment formerly
identified with their social inferiors. This bitterness was directed at
the 'managers' of war, the staff, as well as those at home who enjoyed
'security and comfort' and could not understand the suffering of the
men at the front. [<i>No Man's Land,</i> 94]

Penguin, 1994), 8-12. Tenants in tenements actually had less room than
the law dictated should be allocated for livestock. Buildings intended for
single-family use would have as many as eighty to one hundred residents,
with only one toilet in the yard to service them all. As Kearns points
out, investigative reporting and government studies from the turn of
the century reveal conditions in which



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
it was common to find human excreta scattered about the yards and hallway
passages. Privies and ashpits sometimes became infested with typhoid germs
and yards were regularly flooded withstagnant water and waste creating
an environment in which flies, insects and vermin thrived. . . . Multiple
layers of decomposing wallpaper provided a perfect sanctuary for colonies
of insects while rats as big as cats nested in rotting floor-boards and
roamed freely at night, even entering the beds of nursing mothers and
their infants, drawn by the scent of milk. [12]

The expectations of a soldier coming from this environment would be
vastly different from a middle-class product of the public school system.

George Mosse describes modern masculinity's need for a countertype against
which to define itself. In contrast to the civilized, highly controlled
masculine ideal, men of certain ethnicity or sexuality are marked as
uncivilized, feminine, and dangerously out-of-control. George Mosse,

In these early stories, the self-educated Hanley does not quite have
control of his conventions, producing a wonderful unevenness that,
paradoxically, enables him to get to what's really going on. According to
Hanley's biographer, the author "was not uncritical of his . . . early
work. Too many of the books were written too hastily, he said, under
pressure to earn money" (Harrington, <i>James Hanley,</i> 26). Alan Ross
says of Hanley's earliest pieces that Hanley "aimed, sometimes obliquely,
sometimes directly, at transcription more than description." He is
"a novelist who does not plan, who has no cut-and-dried story, but
whose work is the journey back into his own consciousness." Alan Ross,
introduction to <i>The Last Voyage and Other Stories,</i> by James Hanley
(London: Harvill, 1997), xiv. Whether from lack of time or skill, or as a
conscious technique, Hanley's work feels remarkably free of conventional
dialogue--as if, says Jane Marcus, "he's recording real voices."

"How funny," O'Garra tells Elston, "that in the moment I first realized
your cowardice, I became conscious of my own strength. I must have
pulled you a mile, you swine" ("GP," 21-2). While O'Garra means that he
discovered unknown reserves of power, this episode marks the beginning
of his dissolution. It is instructive to compare "The German Prisoner"
to <i>The Return of the Brute,</i> a war memoir by Liam O'Flaherty,
a proletarian Irish writer severely shell-shocked in the war. In
O'Flaherty's novel, the cowardice of a young soldier infects a hardened
Irish veteran named Private Gunn, prompting Gunn's descent into a madness
that culminates in a suicidal attack in which he strangles his commanding
officer, "uttering queer sounds" and mangling the body with his bare
hands . The boy in O'Flaherty's story embodies the homoerotic
ideal, with "pink cheeks, dazzling white teeth like a girl and big blue
eyes" . Referred to frequently as a "woman" and a "girl," the boy
reminds Gunn of his former wife, and his weakness feels like "seductive
temptation" to Gunn . Liam O'Flaherty, <i>Return of the Brute</i>
(London: Wolfhound Press, 1998). What interests me in both of these
stories is how quickly these Irish soldiers lose their tenuous hold
on masculinity and return to "the brute" when faced with a feminized
English comrade.

Noting how often male love objects are described as blond, Fussell
explains: "To be fair-haired or (better) golden-haired is, in Victorian
iconography, to be especially beautiful, brave, pure, and vulnerable"

holding a tender fascination for many British soldiers (<i>GWM,</i> 276).

Jacqueline Rose's study of psychoanalytic accounts of war reveals a
profound disturbance in that "seemingly secure distinction" between
projection and reality:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If I project aggression on to the other, she or he is likely to
become--in reality--the mirror or embodiment of the aggression I am
trying to displace on to him or her. In other words, paranoid impulses
don't just project on to reality as delusion; they affect reality and
become a component of it. [28]

</blockquote>

<p>
Given this scenario, asks Rose, "how can you recognize the real
enemy. . . . Or rather, how can you distinguish, with absolute certainty,
between your own projections and real external danger? If you produce
the enemy, then you must t him" (28-9). Jacqueline Rose, <i>Why

Carolyn Dean argues that only after the Great War, "when social
commentators and analysts began to postulate a significant link between
the wartime proliferation of pornography and the unprecedented violence
of modern combat," did "pornography and violence become continuous with
descriptions of assaults on the integrity of the human body" . She
writes that many critics in the interwar period



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
no longer equate self-sacrifice with spiritual cleansing, but with
spiritual degradation; the body has become enslaved by its own instincts,
or more specifically, by a compulsive death-drive. . . . The war's
degradation of men's dignity is red in the putatively emasculating
and sexually pathological pleasure of humiliating and being humiliated,
of exposing and being exposed. The war, in this view, had turned into
a pretext for the satisfaction of other pleasures. [63]

Ferguson reports that "on occasions, and with encouragement from some
commanders" British soldiers went into battle determined to take no
prisoners . Even for those with no such intentions, it was difficult,
in the words of one soldier, "once you start killing," to "turn a man off
like an engine" (Ferguson, <i>The Pity of War,</i> 380). Ferguson contends
that the "number of incidents is not as important as the impression they
made on the culture of the trenches. Men magnified these incidents; they
passed into trench mythology" on both sides, discouraging surrender and
prolonging the war (ibid., 386). The episode with the prisoner belongs
to "trench mythology"--except that Hanley's atrocity does not come from
the other side.

For an example of Aldington's salvage operation, see "At All Costs" in
his <i>Roads to Glory</i> (1931; Freeport, N.Y.: Books for Libraries,
1970), which exemplifies the useless sacrifice of noble innocents. In
this story, an officer--whom Aldington calls Hanley--suffers anguish
as he prepares to carry out orders for a suicide mission in which he
must sacrifice his own life and that of a subaltern. He is particularly
anguished by the realization that while he will soon be "a mass of dead
rotting decay," his wife will remain "young and beautiful and desirable"
and eager to replace him in her bed . See Tate for a discussion of
the hysterical repudiation of homosexuals as 'half-men' and 'scented
worms'" articulated by Winterbourne in <i>Death of a Hero</i> and by
Aldington himself in his personal correspondence (Tate, <i>Modernism,
History,</i> 81-3).

Ferguson noted the paradox that while they were "weary of the war, men
do not seem to have been weary of violence" (Ferguson, <i>The Pity of
War,</i> 388). British veterans known as the "Black and Tans" carried out
brutal assaults on Irish Republicans; their withdrawal initiated an even
bloodier civil war. British troops used "extreme violence" in suppressing
riots in Egypt in 1919 and revolts in Palestine and Iraq in 1920 in which
"some 1,500 Egyptians were killed in the space of eight weeks, while
in Iraq General Sir Aylmer Haldane even contemplated using poison gas"
(ibid., 390). In "one of the most seminal atrocities of British imperial
history," soldiers in Amritsar killed 379 people at a political meeting
on 11 April 1919. The toll would have been greater if Brigadier-General
Reginald Dyer "had been able to deploy two armoured cars with machine
guns." The "techniques of mass murder patented on the Western Front"
were now being exported for use in the colonies (ibid., 390-1).

<p>
Had Jane Austen not died at 42&#8212;had she lived instead to 90&#8212;she
could have written twelve more books. Think what this would have done
for English fiction: imagine Jane Austen refining the novel even beyond
the fineness of <i>Persuasion</i>, seeing it through the hard years of
the 1830s, heartening the Bront&euml;s, spoofing Dickens, cautioning
the aesthetes, and even applying Darwin. Imagine such things and you
have to regret the loss of those unwritten novels.

<p>
Austen's fans can say that only death could have stopped her&#8212;she
who forced out work even as Addison's disease shook her pen. The same
cannot be said about E. M. Forster, whose fans can only ask: why, if
he lived to be 90, did he give up fiction at 45? In the second half
of his life he could have written twelve more novels, too: imagine him
bringing the wisdom of <i>Howards End</i> and <i>A Passage to India</i>
to bear upon Indian independence, fascism, or the cold war; imagine him
saving the English novel from its dwindling, or&#8212;and here is where
so many of Forster's fans inquire more plaintively&#8212;fathering a
gay literature. For he might have applied his vast moral and aesthetic
resources to the problem of homosexuality. He might have given his rich
Austenian inheritance to the culture of Stonewall, giving gay

<b></b>

writing respectability and a crucial head start. Imagining that, gay
readers in particular have to regret Forster's unwritten novels. And
they do not even have death to blame.

<p>
Sometimes they blame something that shares death's deterrence. In his
diary for 16 June, 1911, Forster writes of a "weariness of the only
subject I both can and may treat&#8212;the love of men for women and
vice versa".
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 In this and other such moments of disaffection readers have heard
 a worthy reason for Forster's refusal to write: a protest against
 compulsory heterosexuality. From 45 to 90, we might say, Forster
 did after all do something for the English novel: by not writing,
 he proved that one could not fit new gay life into old heterosexual
 forms, even if one were England's greatest living novelist.

<p>
For some readers, then, Forster's unwritten novels speak insurgent
silence. Silence is no statement, however, for those who believe
that Forster could have published gay novels had he only been brave
enough&#8212;that he could have made a real political difference,
and that "compulsory heterosexuality" really had little of death's
deterrence. These other readers lay the blame elsewhere: like so many
of his contemporaries, some say, Forster wanted to treat politics more
directly, in a way fiction-writing could not; or he had finally found
personal "equilibrium," and so lost the compulsion to write; or he just
peaked early and then lived too long&#8212;made his mark, lost interest,
and spent a long dotage enjoying his <i>eminence grise</i>. However
much "the love of men for women &amp; vice versa" may have wearied him,
it alone did not drain his energy for fiction. The less dramatic truth
here, it seems, is that what "dried up" the fictional part of him was
various&#8212;variously composed of any number of resentments, changes,
and alternative aspirations.

<p>
So it seems&#8212;however disappointing it is to give up on the
more heroical and dramatic story of oppression, integrity, and
forsaking. Unless we let a little piece of writing change our minds
again. In the Forster collection at the Modern Archive Centre at King's
College, Cambridge, there is a memoir Forster wrote in the years between
1922 and 1929&#8212;the years in which he finished writing <i>A Passage
to India</i> and finished his fiction-writing career. In this memoir
there is cause for Forster's desertion of fiction that has all anyone
could ever want of drama: for it turns out, after all, to be a story of
forbidden love, untimely death, and noble renunciation.

<p>
The memoir takes the form of a letter, to a young man Forster had met
during his time in Egypt. This young man, Mohammed el Adl, had been
Forster's lover until his death of tuberculosis in 1922. The "letter"
Forster wrote to him is a sort of record of mourning, beginning in 1922
in the full flush of grief and ending after seven years' abatement have
accomplished mourning's reparations. This transformation, however, is
not one that the letter seems to welcome. Forster, it seems, wanted to
refuse to mourn, because mourning would recast his strange and unnameable
feelings for Mohammed as "love"; he found himself <i>melancholy</i>
instead. In that mode, he was not fit for fiction, and no longer happy
with its powers to turn one thing into another. His "letter" to Mohammed
documents for us the development of what we might call <i>melancholy
realism</i>&#8212;the generic mode that would, for the next 45 years,
produce only unwritten novels.

<b></b>

<p>
In 1915, travel to Italy seemed dangerous, so Forster went to Alexandria
instead. There he worked as a "Red Cross Searcher," questioning wounded
soldiers about missing comrades. The work left him time to grow fond
of the city, where he would stay not for the expected three months but
for the duration of the war. He had not initially liked Alexandria. The
place seemed "vastly inferior to India" and the natives like "mud moving,
and exasperating in the extreme" (<i>SLOEMF</i>, I 233). But before too
long he found cause to change his mind&#8212;in the "brown splendour" of
boys swimming "naked and unrebuked" and in the larger diversity of the
population (<i>SLOEMF,</i> I 237). Forster found that the cosmopolitan
mixture of Alexandria's people symbolized "a mixture, a bastardy, an
idea which I find congenial and opposed to that sterile idea of 100%
in something which has impressed the modern world and forms the backbone
of its blustering nationalism."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 This change of heart partook of what would characterize Forster's
 fateful transformation; it predicted the change that would later make
 fiction-writing, too, sound like so much bluster.

<p>
Neither change would have taken place had Alexandria been what he had
expected. Gertrude Bell, an expert on the region, had told him that he
would have no opportunity to get to know the locals: according to Bell,
"I should only see them in the streets as I went to and fro to work"
(<i>MBOEMF</i>, 291). So Forster had not bargained for the encounter
on the tram he took to and from work. The tram had Egyptian conductors,
and one "fresh and sunny" morning in the spring of 1916 Forster looked
up from his seat to see a conductor who made him think: "nice."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 This conductor, it seems, was very young, and the only one who moved
 past passengers without stepping on their feet. He was charming;
 and so Forster made a point of taking his tram regularly. One cold
 winter night the conductor spoke: he asked Forster to get up, because
 his coat was under Forster's seat. The moment was pivotal: "You half
 saluted me at the Terminus after this if your tram came along, I half
 responded. Each knew the other wasn't someone else. No more"("M," 5).

<p>
This was eighteen-year-old Mohammed el Adl, native of Mansura, a
butcher's son, who would soon risk his job to see to it that Forster would
henceforth ride for free. Soon he would take Forster to what he called
his "Home of Misery"&#8212;his "slum" home, where he kept his belongings
all in a little trunk ("not much, but all clean") (<i>SLOEMF</i>, I
263). First&#8212;on their first night together&#8212;Mohammed took
Forster to the Chatby Gardens, and then was sullen because Forster
offered him cake. It seems he resented being bound to reciprocate. So he
sneered and called the cake stale and said he was afraid it might poison
him. But Forster won him over, calling him "gentleboy" ("M," 9), despite
his caste, and making him smile. They went to the House of Misery; they
went to Forster's rooms, and it was there that the "caresses started":
"I think we had been playing chess. Then we reclined on the bed spread,
I neared the wall. I touched your knee&#8212;you inclined toward me. . . Our first kiss follows . . ." ("M," 14). Despite the promising
start things went badly. "For the rest, the evening was a muddle" ("M,"
15): Forster made advances, Mohammed retreated and resisted, and things
even got violent: "When I touched you again you defended yourself and
hurt my hand. You didn't get off my bed, but wouldn't let me come near
you and by accident I scratched your face. That sobered us" ("M," 15).

<b></b>

<p>
They laughed about it later, and eventually had less confused
intimacy. But in a certain sense the whole affair was a muddle. Secrecy
required meeting only every other week&#8212;and then the two soon had to
part for good. Forster found Mohammed an army job that meant relocating
and then Mohammed got married. Such obstacles could only limit the
relationship and subject it always to random or fateful contingencies,
keeping it from becoming anything we would really call a romance.

<p>
But this was just what Forster loved about his relationship with
Mohammed. Random and fateful contingencies were the beauty of it. The
muddle that followed the first kiss, for example, sounds disastrous, but
to Forster it was wonderful because honest, rough, and real. Virtually
every time he described Mohammed Forster dwells upon caprice, surprise,
strangeness, even to the point of taking pleasure in ruin. Liking it
when Mohammed sneers at his cakes; liking it also when "I asked you to
remove your specs, because I found you more beautiful without them, and
you refused irritably" ("M," 7-8); glad when Mohammed says, "I <i>must</i>
be independent&#8212;if I do not want to meet you, I must say 'I do not,'
if am not sure, I must be able to say 'perhaps'" (<i>SLOEMF</i>, I 271);
pleased to note that Mohammed will sometimes refuse a kiss (calling him
"foolish") but then at other times give "a kiss sudden and hard on the
lips" ("M," 16); pleased with "an indescribable mixture of detachment
and tenderness" (<i>SLOEMF,</i> I 272); and in general perfectly happy
to do without romance. For what Forster valued here was what he himself
called <i>realism</i>. Romance would have had coherence of feelings,
effects, intentions; this relationship was all in the stray, purposeless,
arbitrary detail. And every detail "sprang right from the judgment
of a sincere heart," "so off the accredited lines . . . with so much
<i>cheerfulness</i> in it," and "none of the solemnity which Christianity
has thought essential to Romance" (<i>SLOEMF,</i> I 258). Some of the
pleasure came simply from the departure from "respectability," the freedom
from the standard plan. But it seemed to derive more essentially from a
greater proximity to reality&#8212;almost as if Mohammed were a disproof
of metaphysics.

<p>
It is therefore no surprise that Mohammed changed Forster's way of
thinking. In a letter to Florence Barger describing the relationship,
Forster explains how Mohammed's realism revamped ideals he had long
held but never fully mastered. First, he emphasizes, in typical terms,
the realism of this romance: "What I so value in him is his realism and
solidity. He has heaps of romance but no sentimentality consequently"
(<i>SLOEMF,</i> I 268). In what follows, Forster draws a connection
between this realism and the refutation of racism:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Whenever I speak honestly he understands; and despite his maxim&#8212;"I
find a certain amount of lies necessary to life"&#8212;is perfectly
honest to me.&#8212;Does this read odd? It would read odder, indeed
incredibly, to anyone who knew the country. Natives, especially of the
lower city class, are dirty in body and mind, incapable of fineness,
and only out for what they can get. This is the theory to which, after
some reluctance, I had fully subscribed, and like all theories it has
broken down. (<i>SLOEMF</i>, I 268)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
On the one hand we have here an unimpressive change&#8212;from racism
to condescension. But on the other hand we have an important view of
the workings of truth, lie,

<b></b>

and theory. What makes Mohammed proof that natives are not "incapable
of fineness" strangely is his inconsistency. He lies; he is perfectly
honest. That both are true means he is neither the "native" of racism
nor that of romance. He is simply real, and this reality in him
breaks down "theory," not just because it disproves the theory that
natives are incapable of fineness, but because it disallows theory
<i>altogether</i>. There is no way, it seems, to theorize about him,
and that is what makes him both captivating and instructive.

<p>
A similar effect follows Forster's extrapolation of <i>his</i> happiness
to that of others:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->. . . it is such a triumph over nonsense and artificial difficulties: it
is a sample of the other triumphs that I am sure come off but of which
we hear nothing through the brassy rattle of civilisation so called;
triumphs varying greatly in form, but in spirit all the same. When I
am with him, smoking or talking quietly ahead, or whatever it may be,
I see, beyond my own happiness and intimacy, occasional glimpses of the
happiness of 1000s of others whose names I shall never hear, and know
that there is a great unrecorded history. (<i>SLOEMF</i>, I 269)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Just as Mohammed's inconsistencies debunked "theory," the specificity
of the pleasures he produces dispel historical generality. Recorded
history tells only of the sort of love one hears about. But sensitive
now to the terms of "real" love, Forster develops an ear for "whatever
it may be"&#8212;for unheard of happinesses, felt in forms too various
to fit the forms provided. Once again it is as if Forster had come upon
a new style of experience. This is not just something he has never done
before, but something different in kind, like a new medium.

<p>
This is to say that Mohammed meant not only a change from celibacy
to sexuality, and not only an initiation into homosexuality, but an
epistemological change&#8212;a change of mode. This shift is embodied,
in a sense, in something Mohammed said to Forster to brush him off at
the moment of that muddled first kiss. Forster, it seems, had taken
Mohammed's erection as a sign of interest, but Mohammed said, "My damned
prick always stands up whoever it is, it means nothing" ("M," 16). The
meaninglessness here is all: like inconsistency, like unrecordable
history, it indicates nothing larger, and is therefore at once pure
pleasure and real information. It is important to notice here exactly
what drew Forster's interest, and what therefore ultimately drew it away
from his novels' style of creativity: not homosexuality as opposed to
heterosexuality; not the freedom to engage in and speak of love for men;
but rather a way of "connecting" that wholly dispenses with predetermined
feelings and acts, doing things instead according to the radical feel
of the moment and the real needs of body and soul. This radical realism
would naturally have presented itself in homosexual relations, because
these would have had less predetermined about them, but the sexuality
Forster valued so much here had much less to do with object-choice and
much more to do with contingency, spontaneity, and caprice.

<p>
It might seem foolish to stress radical realism here, given the fact that
Forster fits Mohammed fairly crudely into what we call the "romance of
alterity," that exoticism whereby Westeners pretend at love for those
"others" they conquer. Is this not a

<b></b>

colonialist fantasy? Is not the Egyptian boy to the British man what the
colonies were to the crown&#8212;something subordinate, phantasmal, and
exploited? This sort of sexual adventure, in which license suspends the
responsibility required of relationships at home, and cultural stereotypes
encourage a man to dream up his own delightful opposite, happened all
around Forster at this moment, making it perhaps strange to say that for
him the romance was real. But it is the aftermath that justifies the claim
here, for Forster does not just get in and then get out: had his cultural
life persisted as before despite his sexual adventure, Forster might have
been but a sexual imperialist; but the change that follows proves that
Mohammed's alterity had very real effects not only on Forster himself
but on the literary culture to which he had already become indispensable.

<p>
What became of Mohammed's mode of realism when he died? How do you mourn
for someone who "meant nothing"? How, that is, do you feel grief as such
when what you have lost was something you enjoyed not having? These are
the questions that Forster's "letter" to Mohammed exists to answer. And
the answers explain why Forster stopped writing fiction.

<p>
The letter is an elegy. It uses the conventions of elegy to structure
and work through grief. But it is only ostensibly elegiac&#8212;or
only elegiac once it gets to its ending. At first, and principally, it
forestalls and refuses mourning. Its mode is different: it refuses to let
go of the particulars that made Mohammed so wonderfully meaningless. In
so doing it trades mourning for <i>melancholy</i>. Mohammed's sexuality
had been one of pragmatic realism. Forster loved it, and took it on, but
then grief made it recalcitrant. Its attachment to real detail became
a melancholy refusal of unreality&#8212;a refusal of the fictions of
healthy mourning, and ultimately a refusal of fiction itself.

<p>
In the beginning of 1919&#8212;three years before Mohammed's
death&#8212;Forster left Alexandria. In the preceding months, he had
visited Mansurah and found Mohammed in tough shape, fatigued from
long hours in the cotton markets and already beginning to suffer from
the disease that would kill him. But in the years that followed the
relationship went on in its original mode. It was, as before, what time,
circumstances, and mood permitted, and not much more. From 1919 to 1922,
Forster would help Mohammed in what ways he could; often he would long
to be with him, but never did he think of the relationship as anything
primary or deep. Distance and dying did nothing to strengthen the
bond; rather, it helped Forster persevere in unsentimentality and
to correct lapses from realism : "Very difficult to know what the
lover is like&#8212;or rather how he feels and behaves toward the
lover. Determined my life should contain one success I have concealed
from myself and others M's frequent coldness to me. And his occasional
warmth may be due to politeness, gratitude, or pity. The prospect of his
death gives me no pain" (<i>D</i>, 11 May 1922). What sounds callous
is in fact deeply considerate: it is Forster admitting that he has
tried to falsify Mohammed, to make of him a fiction of "success," and
resolving now to affirm the reality. Frequently in these weeks Forster
<i>worries</i> about feeling "love": writing things like "latterly my
great love prevents my feeling that he is real" (<i>D</i>, 7 May 1922),
Forster discovers the odd conflict between love and realism and has to
t to keep the former from taking over.

<b></b>

<p>
So what begins to emerge, in these months before Mohammed's death,
is a sort of rift: there are the truths about Mohammed, made up of his
frequent coldnessess and other refusals, and endorsing an outlook so
rich in reality; and then there are the fictions of success, love, and
romance, made up by Forster himself when indulgent or lazy or when he
wanted to tell himself and others a more satisfying story. On one side,
the realism; on the other side, the fictionality. The two pressed apart
even beyond their long-standing opposition, and did not allow for the
sort of reconciliation, also long-standing, which has allowed writers
in particular to say that fiction <i>produces</i> reality. For no such
philosophies could really distract Forster from his love for the way
Mohammed evaded him.

<p>
Once Mohammed died the rift widened; the "reality" receded, sharpening
Forster's longing for it. This sharpened longing prompted the letter to
Mohammed. And it was the source of the letter's strange characteristic
feature: its approach to grief. Wanting to resist fictions of love and
to maintain a sense of Mohammed's reality, Forster refuses to undergo
mourning. He refuses, that is, to accept the loss, but this does not mean
that he pretends Mohammed has not died, or that he does not care. Rather,
it means that he does not allow mourning to transform the brutal real
fact of death. The best example of this refusal, as we shall see, is
the way he dwells upon the grotesque reality of Mohammed's decomposing
corpse. The counterpart to the pleasure Forster had taken before in
Mohammed's reality, this new realism has the character of what we call
<i>melancholy</i>.

<p>
In a paper published the year Forster met Mohammed, Freud described
<i>melancholia</i> as a pathological stopping-short before mourning. In
his account, melancholy occurs when the ambivalence natural to the
love-relationship becomes, after the death of the beloved, a form of
self-reproach: the melancholic's ambivalence becomes a kind of anger
directed against the self&#8212;even to the point where the self might
"consent to its own destruction" in suicide.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The dynamic Freud describes takes place almost willfully in Forster. His
 ambivalence about the love-relationship was, as we have seen,
 something he cultivated. And it very directly became self-reproach in
 his determination to stay ambivalent: whenever Forster scolds himself
 for pretending his relationship with Mohammed was a sure thing, he
 directs anger against himself in the Freudian fashion. Of course he
 never does so to the point of "consenting to his own destruction." But
 does he not perhaps consent to the destruction of "the fictional part of
 me"? That is, might not Forster's melancholy have directed destructive
 anger against its enemy&#8212;the fictions of romance which, especially
 in mourning, would have worked through what had been so rapturously
 unworkable? Melancholia overdevelops the conscience, or that faculty
 through which we subject ourselves to critical scrutiny. Forster,
 in his melancholic response to Mohammed's death, overdeveloped his
 writerly conscience to the point where it regarded his fictional self
 with a too-factual and withering skepticism.

<p>
Mohammed died with Forster knowing only vaguely how and when and not
knowing what grief would follow. The grief surprised him, by coming only
after a delay: he got confirmation of Mohammed's death on 27 June, 1922,
passed a month in the sort

<b></b>

of "painless" apathy he had been feeling before, but then felt that apathy
transform. On 5 August, compelled by some ever-worsening "oppression,"
he began to write out that apathy's transformation into melancholy
and beyond.

<p>
Forster begins the letter worrying he will get things wrong and falsify
Mohammed's realism. Since "now you are not here to correct me when I think
of you not as you are but as I should like to think of you" ("M," 13),
Forster risks writing not fact but fiction, and he therefore seems to
resolve from the beginning to "correct" himself as far as possible. This
means, paradoxically, pretending that Mohammed is still with him. He
denies the fact that "you are not here": "I write it with my mind on
you and with the illusion that your mind still exists and attends" ("M,"
3). But to have both the realism (which requires Mohammed's attention)
and the truth (which means his death) Forster has to strike a strange
compromise: "I pretend that you are still alive, because it is only thus
that I can think of you as real, although I know that a putrid scrap in
the Monsourah burial ground is all that was you" ("M," 3). In a harrowing
double-bind, Forster finds that being true to Mohammed means thinking
of his corpse; consistency compels grotesque visions, and Forster's
realism goes gothic. It also begins to seem unspeakable. The melancholy
of dwelling on the reality of the dead begins now to put Forster out of
patience with language itself, for language takes the side of falseness,
mourning, and fiction, against the finer truths of sex, decay, melancholy,
and fact.

<p>
We see all this right away as Forster tries in his letter to record the
relationship's initial moments. He writes of his first glimpse of Mohammed
aboard the Bogos tram; of trying to catch that same tram on subsequent
days; Mohammed's polite ways with passengers, the night he first spoke to
Forster, and the day in March of 1917 when he said, "You shall never pay"
("M," 5). He writes of these things but then breaks off and pauses to
voice what will become his letter's perpetual dissatisfaction:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Mohammed I try to keep this real, but my own words get in the way, and
you are decayed to terrible things by this time&#8212;dead six months. I
do not mind that, but I fear you becoming unreal, so that all our talks
together and the occasional nights we have slept in one bed will seem
to belong to other people. So I can't write this letter to you long. It
is an effort for you are not even a ghost now and I am invoking my own
memories. Dear boy, I want those memories to be of you, not stained by
me. I do not want to prate of perfect love, only to write of you as if you
are real. So I try to think of you in your grave sometimes. It is real,
and contemporary with me, it leads me back to the real you. ("M," 6--7)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What leads Forster back to Mohammed is not writing about him: in other
times and places writing might have the power to evoke and to recall,
but here it is just "prating," as if writing cannot help but fall
into the sort of standard patterns that tell of perfect love. Writing
can only "belong to other people," because it cannot help but obey
convention. What leads back to Mohammed&#8212;to that reality he so richly
embodied&#8212;is the mere intractable, unspeakable fact of his corpse,
terrible in decay but wonderful still in singularity. Here there is of
course a problem for a writer. To some degree, the dilemma is eminently
typical: it is the problem, most notably, of those approaches to language
and meaning that emphasize the gaps that come between realities and our

<b></b>

words about them&#8212;of poststructuralist philosophies, most recently,
and of the modernist theories that came before them. But the problem
troubles Forster in peculiar ways, with unique results.

<p>
For it is, first of all, a very specific reality that seems unavailable
to writing: it is the reality of sexual desire free of any story,
free of "perfect love" or "grande passion" as any sexuality would plot
it. Moreover, the fact that the reality is unavailable to writing is,
in this case, not at all welcome. No poststructuralist <i>avant la
lettre</i>, Forster sees no playful advantage in the sort of gap he
discovers here. His liberalism commits him instead to strong belief in
communicative rationality. And it keeps him from becoming what other
modernists similarly awakened had become. Whereas Joyce, for example,
pressed the quest for new reality into linguistic dislocation, Forster
had too much esteem for norms of public speech to violate them as far as
he would have to have done to clean them of their "stain." So what results
for Forster&#8212;from this sexualized obsession with "reality," from his
consequent problem with words&#8212;is a unique form of writing. When
he says, "I cannot write this letter to you long," he refers to a very
strange new choice of mode: he will not write at length, but only
in short bursts, as if to try to use language just enough to invoke
Mohammed but not long enough to make him begin to "become unreal." And
these short bursts of writing will perpetually turn on themselves,
curtailing whenever writerly momentum starts to carry them away.

<p>
The unique result of Forster's grief, in other words, is a strange
melancholic form of writing. In the short run, this melancholic form
produced the letter to Mohammed, a document unusual for its very slow
accretion of short bits: written over the course of seven years, the
letter nevertheless amounts to only twenty manuscript pages, with short
passages dwarfed by the passage of time intervening between them. In the
long run, this melancholic form seems to have brought Forster to a kind
of silence analogous to the letter itself: what fictions Forster might
have begun curtailed themselves instantly, washing back into "reality,"
and leaving ever longer spaces of time between them.

<p>
This silence appears in the letter as a strong anti-linguistic
caution. Forster sounds like a man walking a thin line, for as he notes
"one slip of my mind would fake a spook of you" ("M," 12): one slip
into fiction would falsify; Mohammed would become a romantic spirit,
and the love story would get written. So Forster uses his words very
sparingly&#8212;typically to note in gnomic phrases the times and
ways Mohammed disallowed love. We get short references to muddles,
irritations, refusals, always with the knowledge that "if I miss things
like these you will not be real" ("M," 8). Getting a feel for these gnomic
phrases and their justification, one develops an ear for the silence that
characterizes the second half of Forster's career: both have a sort of
gruff resignation, trying to indicate without words something better than
fiction; and both defer to the pragmatic mode of nonfiction that would
become Forster's exclusive kind of writing. You can hear the Forster
who gave up fiction in the Forster who writes these fragments. Moreover,
you can hear the protest&#8212;so compelling for the way it mixes grief,
desire, and regret; so sorry for its loss of literary faith and its new
sullen brutality; so much like Forster trying to be Proust, sounding
more like Hemingway, and on the way out of the business altogether.

<b></b>

<p>
But the most poignant thing of all here is Forster's inability to
keep it up. Years of melancholy keep him laconic and austere and able
to express himself in the mode appropriate to Mohammed's pragmatic
sexuality; but as years pass, melancholy does give way to mourning,
and fiction-writing ensues after all. The change is poignant because
it finds Forster regretting his relative contentment: at first he
is melancholy and grotesque and taciturn but true; as time goes on,
and constructive mourning becomes possible, things become brighter and
fonder but false, and Forster knows to regret the loss of realism that
comes as a consequence. It is as if he had found, in spite of himself,
the truest way to write, and then lost the knack even as he regained
his equanimity. The irony of that give-and-take could only redouble his
suspicion of fiction-making.

<p>
Here is how the letter to Mohammed documents the change in question. On
page thirteen of the letter Forster writes of his great regret that words
get in the way, still worrying about losing Mohammed's reality. On the
three or four pages that follow, he describes that first muddled sexual
encounter&#8212;the one that left Mohammed with a bloody eye. Next come
hopes dashed&#8212;hopes for more extensive sexual intimacy disappointed
by distance and illness, but, again, with fascination for the honest
realities these failures involved. Then Mohammed suddenly becomes a fading
memory. It is not possible to fix dates, or to know for sure how much time
has passed since Mohammed's death or between installments, but Forster
writes, "months have gone by since I wrote the above. You are dimmer. I
knew it would happen" ("M," 17). The change seems unavoidable&#8212;the
inevitable result of passing years and the way they must make even the
most graphic realities unreal. Forster, however, suggests that something
else has been responsible for letting unreality in. That something is
a sort of epistemological paradox: when Mohammed's reality was fresh,
Forster could not write about it at length for fear of falsifying it into
a fiction; now that Mohammed has faded, however, and that danger no longer
seems so great, Forster lacks the written record necessary to serve as
a reminder. At this point Forster writes, "I shall never describe every
moment of our intercourse, as I had hoped" ("M," 17). The regret here
runs up against the paradox in question, whereby description then would
have been but a rewriting of those moments of intercourse, but could
have served now as the best hope for accurate recollection. Between that
then and this now Forster seems to locate fiction's failure. As he builds
towards the finish of the memoir-writing, finally, "you must join my dead"
("M," 19)&#8212;he seems to finish writing something that is much less
an elegy for Mohammed and much more an elegy for the vocation that has
so gracelessly let him down.

<p>
"I have fallen in love through you, but falling in love has obscured you"
("M," 17): in life as in the letter, what Mohammed represents gives way
to its negation, and so his status has changed. No longer a singular
phenomenon, he has become "part of my development" ("M," 18)&#8212;a
moment in the larger plot through which Forster can now feel and really
act upon love for another man. As part of this plot, Forster knows,
Mohammed will "shrink to nothing" ("M," 18). And as he so shrinks Forster
will be able to rise above the frozen depths of melancholy realism,
finish the memoir, and

<b></b>

write with more lively fancy. "This letter shall be finished tonight. It
is over seven years since it was begun, and it was time that it was
signed" ("M," 18): here there is relief, pleasure, and no small regret
for the way mourning's end marks a failure. On the one hand, the grief
is gone, but on the other hand the process has derealized Mohammed, and
Forster virtually says as much when he says, mingling boast with regret,
"You have sunk into a grande passion&#8212;I knew you would . . ." ("M,"
19). This is just the outcome Forster had hoped to avoid&#8212;this
sentimentality, through which Mohammed, who really "was not deeply
attached to me" ("M," 19), becomes a player in romantic tragedy. But such
is the work of writing, it seems, which has now fully begun. Last traces
of the older mode&#8212;the melancholic refusal&#8212;persist, for "I am
still able to write 'you' instead of 'him'" ("M," 19) and still able to
say bracingly blunt things like, "you were not deeply attached to me"
("M," 18) and "[I] am pretty certain not to think of you when I die"
("M," 20). But such traces vanish when Forster writes, "tomorrow you must
join my dead" and signs the letter to "Mohammed el Adl-my love" ("M," 20).

<p>
This is not to say, however, that writing really recovers itself here,
for while it regains the strength of the grand passion it does not
regain authenticity. Forster cannot help but let it do its work, since
the realism that was its alternative has lost its hold on him, but his
cynicism about it persists. In fact the readiness of writing to take
the recalcitrant Mohammed and make him "my love" seems to become, for
Forster, a great absurdity. He indulges it here, to get the memoir done,
but elsewhere we see signs that it turns into an object of criticism
and finally the cause of disenchantment. The signs appear at first in
two pieces of writing: in <i>A Passage to India</i>, where melancholy
realism does finally win the day, and in Forster's review of Proust,
which questions the way that fiction remakes the facts of life.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Forster's letter to Mohammed owes a great debt to Proust. Showing how
Mohammed's memory changes over time, able to find in its last moments
what it cannot find in its first, concerned specifically with the way
that fiction remakes old reality, the letter is like Proust's <i>&Agrave;
la Recherche du temps perdu</i> in miniature. And in fact Forster wrote
the letter and read Proust in the same seven years&#8212;beginning both
projects in 1922 and finishing them in 1929. In 1929, he wrote a review
of Proust, telling for its concern with the same issues that Forster had
taken up in the letter. He stresses three things: that Proust "achieved
a new view of the impermanence of the human race" ("P," 99); that he knew
that "the fonder we are of people the less we understand them" ("P," 100);
and that Proust had the genius and patience for a "double curiosity" ("P,"
101). Forster was not much like Swann or Charlus in love, but he suffered
as they do from the double sadness of the first two of these things,
knowing that impermanence and fondness, each in their opposite way,
keep us from truly knowing people. But it is the third thing&#8212;the
"double curiosity"&#8212;that is the key preoccupation. Here is Forster's
description of it:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
His book is the product of a double curiosity. The initial curiosity
was social; he went to all those awful parties and had those barren
relationships and expensive illnesses, and knew

<b></b>

in his own person what it is to be a snob, a jealous lover, an orphan,
and an invalid with a red nose. And then came the second curiosity, the
artistic. He recollected the parties, and robbed them of their stings;
they hurt him no longer, and were for the first time useful. Even love,
that most distressing of all illusions, can be useful, and A and B,
subjected to analysis, can be seen functioning like bacteria in a
test-tube, innocuous at last, and suitable characters for a book. ("P,"
101)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The same double curiosity occurs in Forster's letter to Mohammed. The
initial curiosity is a matter of unwilled pragmatic experience, knowledge
in one's person, diverse and unpredictable; the second curiosity
(that of the "grande passion") is detached, artistic, and the creator
of useful illusions. The distinction is like that which Forster makes
between "what happened" and "what I write," and it may well have been
what finally helped Forster to mourn. It helped him heal the breach,
for Proust showed him (as he has shown so many others) how writing can
overcome the problem of expressing reality by creating its past. The
result, in Forster's letter, was Proustian, insofar as the letter
presents not only the second curiosity (the useful illusion of love)
but the primary curiosity (the hurtful stings) as well. The letter is
a Proustian solution to the problem of melancholy.

<p>
It is not therefore something good: Forster has no full admiration for
the artistic process through which Proust (and he himself) turns old
stings into useful illusions. Forster's distrust comes through in the
reference to bacteria&#8212;the bacteria made innocuous so that they
become like characters in a book; and it comes through in the way Forster
ends the essay: "Almost, though not entirely, does he represent us; to
the historian, the similarity will be sufficient, and the epic quality
of the work will be acknowledged" ("P," 102). Having himself so strongly
felt the representational gap between writing and the reality of "us,"
Forster seems to see in Proust a certain falsity, and to see his gift for
doubleness as a kind of duplicity. Couple that perception with Forster's
feeling about sexuality in Proust and it starts to seem that Proust's
solution could not be Forster's: "I have never tried to turn a man into a
girl, as Proust did with Albertine, for this seemed derogatory to me as a
writer" (<i>MBOEMF</i>, 336). Here Forster has less regard for Proustian
transformations, and suggests that rather than making writing great,
they degrade it, at least when aspects of sexuality are in play. In these
criticisms of Proust, we begin to see signs that it is not the case that
Forster's memoir is a Proustian solution to the problem of melancholy; we
begin to see signs that the problem of melancholy discredits the Proustian
solution. And we begin to see the memoir almost as a parody of Proust:
whereas in Proust a long extent of writing allows for a slow shift from
primary to secondary curiosity, in the memoir a quicker change seems
far less credible, and therefore a product of doubt rather than imitation.

<p>
So rather than choosing to write fiction like Proust, Forster chooses not
to write fiction at all&#8212;because secondary curiosity, as a writerly
practice and as a way of dealing with desire, transforms reality into
incomplete representation. But this is something Forster had begun to
discover as soon as he felt the urge to recast Mohammed as a lover,
and we can see the signs of his resistance to secondary curiosity even
as early as <i>A Passage to India</i>.

<b></b>

<p>
We see it at the end of that novel, in the "half-kiss" between Fielding
and Aziz that indicates a firm refusal to take a sunny view of the
Anglo-Indian future. Fielding has been fair-minded and compassionate in
his treatment of Aziz and by the end of the novel seems fully ready to
befriend him; and Aziz seems ready, too&#8212;to forget even the "stings"
of his harrowing time as the imperialists' scapegoat. And yet the two
do not finally come together: in that blundered half-kiss, as the two
men collide and separate and their horses swerve apart, as the earth
says, "No, not yet," and the sky says, "No, not there" (<i>APTO</i>,
362), Forster chooses no closing benevolence. Instead he replays the way
Mohammed would and would not kiss him: in both cases ambivalent affections
realistically combine attraction and repulsion, making the combination
proof against false romance. Melancholy here becomes refusal to imagine
post-Imperial harmony, an insistence upon the wisdom of primary curiosity,
against the falsifications of fictional longing.

<p>
Melancholy realism is also the mode of the Marabar Caves. They share the
"putrescence" of Mohammed's decaying corpse; they are also a kind of
mystery gone bad, an otherness that has been a source of excitement but
becomes a site of terrible meaninglessness. Like Mohammed's corpse, the
Caves show what happens when one ascribes to the view that "everything
exists, nothing has value" (<i>APTI</i>, 165)&#8212;the truth that the
echo of the caves teaches Mrs. Moore. And if that echo "undermine[s]
her hold on life" (<i>APTI</i>, 165) it does so perhaps because
it was also undermining the life of the fiction she inhabits. That
fiction&#8212;Forster's fiction&#8212;was also at that moments suffering
ever-greater self-doubt, set against itself by the worry that truth is
a thing buried away like a corpse or a cave. "Nothing, nothing attaches
to them, and their reputation&#8212;for they have one&#8212;does not
depend upon human speech" (APTI, 137): the caves are "difficult to
discuss" (<i>APTI</i>, 137), as was Mohammed, and when things go bad
they embody, as he did, an extreme refusal to console (<i>APTI</i>,
137). Like Forster's "words" for Mohammed the echo of the caves then
speak against writing: "Whatever is said, the same monotonous voice
replies . . . Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a
boot, all produce 'boum'" (<i>APTI</i>, 163).

<p>
These, then, are some of the signs that melancholy has turned its
destructive reproaches against the consolations of fiction itself;
that "the fictional part of me dried up" in the aridity of melancholy
realism&#8212;and signs that sexuality, after all, did in certain ways
end Forster's career as a novelist. Not, as we have thought, because
compulsory heterosexuality kept him from choosing what subjects he wanted,
but because a certain style of homosexuality confronted Forster with a
realism better than anything fiction could give him. Mohammed's pragmatic
sexuality confronted Forster with the reality of arbitrary, patternless,
immediate desire; that reality eclipsed all others; and clarified itself
in death, demanding in death a strict and melancholy relation to its
truths. Faithful to it, Forster sacrifices his fiction. The death of his
writing self begins in <i>A Passage to India</i>, where the melancholy
refusal booms out its monotonous voice from the Caves to the novel's
conclusion; it signals itself in Forster's mixed review of Proust; and
it is memorialized, finally, in Forster's unwritten novels. So we might
say after all that those novels do speak a kind of insurgent silence,
insofar as they borrow the voice of the Marabar Caves to protest against
our fictions of desire.

<b></b>

<p>
But can they speak so to us? Can we take this consolation, hearing
insurgence in those forty years of silence? I think we can, if we hear it
as an encouragement to be <i>melancholy readers</i>. Forster's unwritten
novels may mean a lot if we let them make us skeptical readers, who
wonder always whether the novels we read ought to have been written. For
the most part we believe that any expression is better than nothing, or,
more specifically, that any fictional record of the self is worthwhile
if it brings coherence to what would otherwise be a random life. But
with Forster in mind we might be more critical&#8212;and read with the
critical reproaches of the melancholy self&#8212;by subjecting what we
read to a different kind of test. When, for example, we read a book that
aims to sum up an experience or a life, we might ask if its summation
is any better than random unknowing. We might ask if there might be
greater truth in nothing. When we read a book about love, especially
a love that claims our attention because of its departure from norms,
Forster's melancholy realism might usefully put it to the test that asks
if writing can really follow the departure.

<p>
Forster's memoir to Mohammed does not quite end in 1929. In 1958, while
going through personal effects, Forster rediscovered the letters Mohammed
wrote to him in his last weeks. These he transcribed into the book in
which, thirty years before, he had recorded the moment in which Mohammed
finally joined his dead. He wrote to his biographer, P. N. Furbank,
about the rediscovery:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
If there seems time, I want to tell you of a strong experience or rather
re-experience that I have just had. I am destroying or rearranging
letters, and came across those from Mohammed el Adl&#8212;I may not
even have mentioned his name to you, he was a tram-conductor whom I
met in Alex[andria] 1917-1919, and again saw in 1922, soon before his
death. I assumed the letters would be nothing much, but gave a glance
before destroying them and was amazed&#8212;all the things I adore most
glittering in them . . . They have given me the oddest feeling, and one
which I am very fortunate to have. (<i>SLOEMF</i>, II 271)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
That odd feeling recurs, and is explained, when Forster again returns
to the "scraps surviving from him" in 1963, and calls them "shymaking
and threnodic" (<i>SLOEMF</i>, II 287). It is interesting that Mohammed
still has this particular impact&#8212;glittering, and giving an odd
feeling, which mixes emotions. And it is interesting too that Forster
rather sentimentally says now that "with one exception&#8212;and
that a tremendous one&#8212;he has been the greatest thing in my life"
(<i>SLOEMF</i>, II 287). What we get, in this last reflection on Mohammed
and his meaning, is a mitigated sentimentality, which does justice to
the beloved, one last time, by remembering to refuse him.

<p>
In the period from 1909&#8212;1922 when T.S. Eliot was writing
and publishing poems such as "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
"Portrait of a Lady," "Preludes," and The Waste Land&#8212;poems that
firmly established his reputation as one of the major poets of the
century&#8212;he was simultaneously composing a long cycle of intensely
sexual, bawdy, pornotropic, and satirical verse that has only recently
come to light. Centered on the seafaring adventures of a colonial explorer
named "Columbo" (Eliot uses a pseudo-Italian version of Christopher
Columbus's name) and his encounters with two native inhabitants of Cuba,
"King Bolo and his Big Black Bassturd Kween," these poems comically and
obscenely portray the history of early European expansion as an orgy of
uncontrollable desire and deviant sexuality. Columbo's voyages and his
first contacts with the King and Queen of Cuba take place by, through,
and for sex, and they re sodomy, masturbation, miscegenation,
scatological rituals, and rape as the modus operandiof colonial
expansion. Eliot continued to write this extensive cycle throughout
his life, and portions of it he shared privately with a homosocially
arranged coterie of male writers, including Conrad Aiken, Clive Bell,
Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, and Ezra Pound.Taken
as a corpus, the poems (untitled by Eliot) allegorize Eliot's concerns
with his nascent reputation as a poet, his anxious desire for publicity,
his exile from the United States, and his uneasy relation to issues of
race, sex, and colonialism. They explode reigning myths about Eliot's
asexuality, and they

<b></b>

demand radical rereadings of the place of sex, race, history, and desire
in Eliot's poetic and critical oeuvre.

<p>
Shockingly different in form, kind, and content from Eliot's canonical
poems, the Columbo and Bolo stanzas, with sing-song, adolescent rhythms
and rhyme schemes that seem more appropriate to schoolboy doggerel
than to the poetry of a major literary re, would hardly have done
Eliot's literary reputation much good on the London literary scene of
the 1910s and early 1920s. Nevertheless, as we will see, Eliot actively
tried to get them published. In what appears to be two of the early
stanzas&#8212;in terms of the New World voyage of discovery that Eliot
charts&#8212;Columbo is preparing to leave Spain under the patronage of
Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, and the following scene takes place:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
One day the king &amp; queen of Spain
<br />
They gave a royal banquet
<br />
Columbo having passed away
<br />
Was brought in on a blanket
<br />
The queen she took an oyster fork
<br />
And pricked Columbo's navel
<br />
Columbo hoisted up his ass
<br />
And shat upon the table.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Columbo and his merry men
<br />
They set sail from Genoa
<br />
Queen Isabella was aboard
<br />
That famous Spanish whore.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The penetrating "prick" of the queen's "oyster fork" is apparently
enough to resurrect Columbo from the dead: prodding him&#8212;indeed,
marking him with the threat of rape&#8212;with her phallic utensil, as
she mixes sex and appetite to awaken him to his scatological act. Columbo
returns the queen's "prick" with a contrary but commensurate response,
marking his immanent departure of discovery with a gesture of anal
excrement. Evidently we are meant to read her "prick" as phallic, since
it repeats a phallic moment just seven lines earlier where Eliot writes
anti-Semitically that when Columbo went to see a doctor in Spain,
"Where doctors are not many / The only doctor in his town / Was a
bastard jew named Benny," who "filled Columbo's prick / With Muriatic
Acid" (<i>IOTMH</i>, 315). Eliot's rendition of the colonial historical
imaginary begins with a mocking critique of its origins, which are now
located in the performance of infantile and anal phantasies involving a
non-verbal exchange between patron and subject, one whose signification
operates as both erotic tribute and offensive rebuke.

<p>
Indeed, anal excrement will be the great, expendable form of currency and
expression in these poems: it is alternately deposited at formal social
occasions, thrown, used as a sexual turn-on, depicted as the goods Columbo
brings back to Europe from the New World, and proposed as the substance
of a meal. Later on, within the social structure Columbo finds in Cuba,
"King Bolo's swarthy bodyguard . . . A wild and hardy set of blacks"
will echo and repeat Columbo's gesture of anal excrement in front of Queen

<b></b>

Isabella: while Bolo is lying "down in the shade / His royal breast
uncovering / They mounted in a banyan tree / And shat upon their
sovereign" (<i>IOTMH</i>,316). Part insult, part sexual exhibitionism
and even sexual flattery, anal excrement is omnipresent in these poems,
and asks us to rethink the relation between colonialism and waste,
pillage and bodily excess.

<p>
In the above stanza, Eliot is also already playing with the queer valences
of "Queen"&#8212;as he will do elsewhere in the Bolo poems&#8212;to
suggest not only a hyperbolically sexual character of colonialism, but
also to propose that it thrives on deviant sexualities. Manly women who
"prick" prompt a shocking admixture of resurrection and excrement. Eliot
is at once homophobic in his rendering and homoerotically fascinated, and,
as will be shown, the homoerotic content of these poems was central to
the impetus for their creation and circulation among an all-male group of
peers. Queen Isabella, Christopher Columbus's Spanish-Catholic patroness
who favored his voyage while others looked more skeptically on his
prospects, is red as both an ambiguously female and potentially queer
"queen," while she is also the radically and misogynistically (though
less dangerous) feminine "whore" who acts as the envoy for Columbus's
early trans-Atlantic voyages. Her support of Columbus allowed him to
become the major Atlantic explorer for Spanish royalty and "discoverer"
of the "New World." Queen Isabella, who lived contemporaneously with the
great British "virgin," Queen Elizabeth&#8212;another major female re
of rule who had to negotiate alternating cultural representations of her
as whore and virgin&#8212;has been sexualized in more than one account,
as it has been difficult for interpreters of colonial history to imagine
a powerful queen without also imagining her sexual availability.

<p>
In terms remarkably similar to those found in Eliot's better-known poems,
the categories of history and sex, and memory and desire, make themselves
felt together and inseparably as Eliot proposes that to write a history
of New World discovery is also, inevitably, to write a sexuality. In
"Gerontion" , he res history both as intensely feminine and
corporeal:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think now
<br />
History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors
<br />
And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,
<br />
Guides us by vanities. Think now
<br />
She gives when our attention is distracted
<br />
And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions
<br />
That the giving famishes the craving.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>IOTMH</i>, 32-38)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Although it has rarely been read as such, this passage refers rather
explicitly to female genitalia as a metaphor for the permutations
of history, and the Columbo and Bolo poems corroborate such an
interpretation. In <i>The Waste Land</i> , "mixing memory and
desire" is claimed initially as April's particular cruelty, but memory
is thereafter unable to operate without always already intimating
desire&#8212;whether for the language of Shakespeare, and the family
romance his words invoke ("I remember / Those are pearls that were his
eyes"), for the memory of Richmond, where "I raised my knees,

<b></b>

/ Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe," or for the homoerotic tribute
to the drowned Phoenician sailor, to cite only three moments in the
poem's complicated network of memory and desire.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Likewise, the Columbo and Bolo poems negotiate the intersections of
 cultural memory and erotic desire to propose, in a more sophomoric
 vein, that colonial discovery was about sexual conquest, and that to
 remember the origins of colonialism we would do well to laugh at its
 physical excesses.

<p>
To date, these Columbo and Bolo poems have received almost no critical
attention and have been largely unexamined since their respective dates of
(still partial) publication in 1988, 1990, and 1996. At present there
is only one essay on the poems, apart from a few published reviews
treating Ricks's 1996 <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> (in which the
bulk of the stanzas first appeared), and the occasional indications in
biographies and critical guides that Eliot wrote some "bawdy" verses
about Christopher Columbus.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 It is difficult to know where to begin with these bawdy verses,
 since they are as offensive as they are fascinating, as dangerous as
 they are subversive. They play recklessly on prohibitions, offering
 a satirical poetics of desire and memory whose comic edge is always
 in danger of collapsing into the outright racism, homophobia, and
 misogyny that they ventriloquize, repeat, and critique. Yet to read
 them without addressing their comic-book humor would be to oversimplify
 them radically, and would be to refuse the playful interruption they
 offer to the still-dominant but all-too-narrow reading of T.S. Eliot
 as a conservative representative of high literary modernism and its
 critical correlative, the New Criticism.

<p>
Given Eliot's desire for their publication, the extended period of their
composition, and the range of issues that they tropologically invoke,
we cannot simply dismiss them as "mere" juvenilia. The Columbo and
Bolo stanzas are not only an occasional literary preoccupation: their
composition spans Eliot's entire adult lifetime and the body of work
they represent is substantial, totaling at least seventy-five stanzas
in all. So far, twenty-nine of these have been published&#8212;including
nearly ten in Valerie Eliot's 1988 <i>The Letters of T.S. Eliot: Volume
One, 1898-1922</i>, seventeen in Christopher Ricks's 1996 <i>Inventions of
the March Hare</i>, two in <i>The Faber Book of Blue Verse</i>&#8212;and
dozens more sit unpublished in archives.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
In his 1998 review of <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i>, Alex Zwerdling
argues that "the cultural dispensation from which Eliot emerged demanded
virtual silence on the subject of erotic life. Though he would free
himself from it in part, the unpublished poems show that his imagination
constantly brooded on the forbidden subject in ways that would have
shocked his original readers".
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Zwerdling also notes that in the sexually explicit sections of the
 draft for "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"&#8212;"Prufrock's
 Pervigilium," which appears in <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> for
 the first time&#8212;one "finds not only 'lonely men in shirtsleeves,
 leaning out of windows,' but 'women, spilling out of corsets,' standing
 in the entries of 'evil houses leaning all together' and 'pointing a
 ribald finger at me in the darkness.'"
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Zwerdling's remarks might equally apply to the more shocking Columbo and
 Bolo verses. In these, Eliot goes much further. Instead of synecdoche
 ("spilling out of corsets" for female body parts) Eliot offers

<b></b>

an exaggerated and explicit bawdiness, in which the poems' res are
capable of extraordinary cartoon-like feats, and exist without fear of
death or repercussions of any kind. Consider these cartoon-like images:
"A bullet came along the road / And up Columbo's asshole;" when he
is "sick-o" he "filled the pump with argyrol / And rammed it up his
prick-o;" Columbo "spun his balls around his head / And cried 'Hooray
for whores;'" and following the dictates of navigation, the crew "turned
[Columbo's] asshole S.S.W." (<i>IOTMH</i>, 318, 319). As we discover
when reading the Columbo and Bolo verses, Eliot was hardly a passive
victim of sexually suggestive finger pointing: he himself shakes quite a
"ribald" finger at his original and later readers in these verses.

<p>
Eliot not only mocks historical and quasi-historical res of the early
colonial era, but he does so while simultaneously parodying poetic form
and expression. As in his other poems, Eliot pushes traditional generic
boundaries, in this case by mixing aspects of several forms of traditional
light bawdy verse, including the limerick and the clerihew, to offer a
peculiarly modernist, self-conscious form of pornotropic doggerel. He
called his Columbo and Bolo poems "ballads," and imagined setting them to
music one day. Jonathan Gill argues that the verses reveal an "affiliation
with songs found in any number of popular anthologies of Negro song,"
and claims that they borrow conventions from minstrelsy song by featuring
"phonetic spelling, improper syntax, and highly charged and malleable
rhythms," as well as a "double tone".
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 As Francis Teague writes of the clerihew, we might also say that this
 verse provides "a cockneyed look at the great"&#8212;of historical
 conquest, in this example. The clerihew "differs from other light
 verse forms by its roughness: while other light verse is polished,
 the clerihew is deliberately clumsy, and might be said to burlesque
 a form such as the limerick."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 In effect, the form thus mirrors the poems' content, burlesquing
 traditional literary genres at the same time that the poems
 parodyreceived narrative histories about the legend of Columbus.

1 Public Desires and Private Circulations: <br />Eliot's Coterie
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Who were Eliot's intended readers? Eliot had been writing the Columbo and
Bolo poems at least since he was an undergraduate at Harvard (1906-1909),
and it is likely that he shared them aloud with several of his male
friends from that time onward.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 The earliest record we have of their circulation appears in July 1914,
 immediately before the beginning of the First World War, when Eliot
 included them in several letters to Conrad Aiken, a slightly younger
 friend with whom he had worked on <i>The Harvard Advocate</i>. At
 the time, Eliot was studying German at a summer-language program in
 Marburg that would soon be cut short by Germany's declaration of war
 against Russia on 1 August, 1914. Eliot, in other words, began sharing
 his parody of early European colonialism with others at precisely
 the moment when Europe was entering the First World War. The Columbo
 and Bolo poems thus gesture backward to relatively distant historical
 "origins" exactly when a new era of European national and international
 politics was unfolding. That is, they look backward while reflecting
 the preoccupations of the new, using a historical rendition to critique
 the continued operations of colonialism within the modernist moment
 whose <i>avant-garde</i> demanded formal and thematic innovation.

<b></b>

<p>
Eliot persisted in writing these verses throughout his lifetime,
and he gradually expanded the circle of friends with whom he shared
them. Although at present we do not have access to the very latest
poems, we know from Aiken that Eliot was still writing them until close
to his death. Aiken wrote a letter to Eliot and his wife Valerie in
December 1964, less than a month before Eliot died on 4 January 1965,
expressing regret that this year they would not have their usual exchange
of Columbo and Bolo poems: "But o dear we shall miss our annual meeting
in New York and the exchange of Bolos and lime rickeys at the River Club
or Vanderbilt."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Astonishingly, the Bolo verses were the ones Eliot most unceasingly
 returned to and produced.

<p>
Their circulation seems to have been initially prompted by conditions
of both literary and personal history&#8212;in part by the arrival of
Wyndham Lewis's first issue of <i>Blast</i> on the London literary scene
in June 1914, and in part by Eliot's growing disillusionment with the
academic establishment of which, in 1914, while still a Ph.D. student in
philosophy at Harvard, he believed he was destined to be a part. Their
circulation thus stems from overlapping public and private desires:
evidence of his wish to participate in the public moment of the appearance
of <i>Blast</i>'s second issue, tokens of a personal desire to parody
and distance himself from the pedantic milieu that he was soon to leave.

<p>
The circulation of the Columbo and Bolo poems begins, importantly, with
mimicry&#8212;a mode they will continue to reflect as they alternate
between parody, satire, and outright repetition of racist codes
and topoi. Deliberately echoing the sort of humor found in Lewis's
new journal, in which Lewis alternately mocks ("Blasts") and praises
("Blesses") public res according to satirical moral judgments of them,
Eliot begins his letter to Aiken with the following heading:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
<div align="center">
BLESS
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; COLUMBO
<br />
BOLO BLUBUNG CUDJO
<br />

<br />
BLAST
<br />
THE BOSUN COUSIN HUGH THE COOK
<br />
PROF. DR. KRAPP
</div>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A jocular letter ensues that pokes fun at academics and includes
one of Eliot's accomplished comic-like pen drawings (<a name="1"
HREF="9.2mcintire_res.html#1"> 1</a>). The drawing shows
Bolo as a rather large, bald man of ambiguous race, smoking a cigar,
decked out with a monocle and a polka-dotted bowtie. Beneath him the
caption reads "VIVA BOLO!!" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 43). Bolo seems rather pleased
with himself, and appears to be ogling something or someone outside the
frame of the drawing. Behind him is a mountain which places him in the
rocky landscape of contemporary Germany. (Eliot depicts this again a week
later in a letter to his American cousin, Eleanor Hinkley [<i>LOTSE</i>,
48]). Bolo is thus curiously <i>distant</i>, temporally speaking, and
<i>present</i> at the same time: he is simultaneously the imaginary King
of Cuba from Columbus's day, and a symbolic, timeless re with

<b></b>

infinitely changeable historical locations&#8212;a gesture that asks,
in another way, that we read Eliot's fascination with Bolo as reflective
of his own contemporaneity.

<p>
Most of those whom Eliot chooses to "Bless" or "Blast" are historical
or stock res that he parodies elsewhere in the Bolo cycle. While
Christopher Columbus is the most explicitly historical re, King Bolo
may also be modeled on a historical re named King Shamba Bolongongo
who died in 1628, "ruler of the Kuba tribes, legendary for the number
of widows and children he left."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Christopher Ricks suggests that Eliot was possibly aware of some early
 comedic ballads by W. S. Gilbert (of later Gilbert and Sullivan fame),
 whose poem, "King Borria Bungalee Boo," depicts a "man-eating African
 swell" with a small tribe of all-male "subjects."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Gilbert's ballads, which are disturbingly racist without showing
 the least evidence that they are aware of being so, recount how King
 Burria's tribesmen wage war against a tribe of Amazon women

<b></b>

ruled by "Queen Loo" in order to satiate their cannibalistic urges. While
the Amazonian women decide that they will try to win over the all-male
tribe peacefully through their coquettish ways, their sexual advances
do not persuade King Burria's men, and eventually the king himself eats
Queen Loo while his tribesmen feast on her subjects. As in Eliot's
Columbo and Bolo poems, appetite and sex are commensurate with each
other, and the two ends of the spectrum of war and peace turn out to
be a choice between two forms of incorporation: cannibalism or sex,
both involved with Eros and Thanatos.

<p>
The other res Eliot chooses to "Bless" or "Blast" are again
either historical or representatives of a type. The redundantly titled
"Prof. Dr. Krapp" is aptly named for the "Krapp" he produces, and is
one of several fictional professors whom Eliot mocks at some length
in the same letter, and then in his 1920s correspondence with Bonamy
Dobr&eacute;e. "Squirty Pansy" invokes the playfulness of slang to praise
a sexually ejaculative homosexual male. (The <i>OED</i> cites 1929 as the
first time "pansy" takes on a queer valence in English, defining it as
"effeminate; homosexual; affected;" Eliot's use of the term precedes
the <i>OED</i>'s example by fourteen years.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>) The fact that Eliot "Bless[es]" "Squirty Pansy" should alert us
again to the homoerotic content of the Bolo poems, and to a recurring
investment Eliot had at this time with the queer. We might also note the
preponderance of the alliterative "B's" and "C's" in Eliot's "Bless"
and "Blast" tribute to Lewis: with the exception of "Squirty Pansy"
all of his res begin with either a "B" or a hard "C" sound. Taking
alliteration to ridiculous limits, Eliot joins in with Lewis's version
of cultural critique and adopts <i>Blast</i>'s idiom in order to express
his own scatological and anti-academic satire of imperialism, one which
is also ambivalent towards institutional religion.

<p>
Although Eliot "Bless[es]" the Chaplain, his attitude to religion in
these stanzas is as vexed as his attitude to colonialism. Sundays in
particular seem to be good days for masturbation and rape in the cycle,
and they represent the only day of the week that is ever named. The
chaplain himself is hardly a re of sexual purity, and he eagerly
participates in the "spirit" of sex aboard the ship by whistling at
King Bolo's Kween and buggering himself while at sea: "K.B.b.b.b.k. /
Was awf'ly sweet and pure / She said 'I don't know what you mean!' /
When the chaplain whistled to her" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 126). Eliot's register
of buffoonery about the religious may strike us as rather surprising,
given his conversion to Anglo-Catholicism in 1927. These poems show
us an altogether different side of Eliot, a re more divided in his
literary and religious convictions than we might now think, especially
in the context of what Ronald Bush has articulated as "the reductive
force of his most recent metamorphosis," whereby critics have insisted
on reading him as a representative of formalism and orthodoxy.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 As Michael Levenson argues about <i>The Waste Land</i>, "it has been
 too tempting for too long to assimilate the poem to the events that
 came later in the decade, even shortly later, to see it as safely
 predicting the dispositions of the mid and late twenties: the poem as
 proto-Anglican, crypto-classical, or neo-monarchist."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Immediately after the imitative tribute to Lewis, Eliot appends a Columbo
and Bolo stanza to his letter:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Now while Columbo and his men
<br />
Were drinking ice cream soda
<br />
In burst King Bolo's big black queen
<br />
That famous old breech l(oader).
<br />
Just then they rang the bell for lunch
<br />
And served up&#8212;Fried Hyenas;
<br />
And Columbo said "Will you take tail?
<br />
Or just a bit of p(enis)?"
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTSE</i>, 42)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The first stanza Eliot sends to Aiken is both disgusting and humorous,
adolescent while it ventriloquizes racist and sexist stereotypes. Columbo
and his all-male crew are evidently enjoying a dessert-like treat when
suddenly "King Bolo's big black queen" "burst" upon the scene. This
is apparently the queen's preferred mode of entrance, and in another
stanza she arrives on board in the same fashion: "King Bolo's big black
kukquheen / Was fresh as ocean breezes. / She burst aboard Columbo's ship
/ With a cry of gentle Jesus" (<i>LOTSE</i>,205). A disruptive element,
the queen is immediately sexualized and propositioned by Columbo, as
he wonders if she might "take" the strange (evidently native) food he
offers. (It is nothing less than parts of a hyena, an animal known for
its uncontrollable laughter, which in its own way emphasizes the hysteria
underlying the encounter between Europeans and natives.) Eliot here
participates in a racist imaginary that res blacks, and especially
black women, as inviting sex and its attendant discourses, at once using
and mocking a phantasmatic perception that had been well in place from
the time of early colonialism.

<p>
Not only have black bodies been red in the white imagination
as signifying an excess of sexuality, but, through their ostensible
uncontrollability, they have also been situated on the border ground
with homosexuality. bell hooks quotes Sander Gilman to propose that "'by
the eighteenth century, the sexuality of the black, male and female,
becomes an icon for deviant sexuality.'"
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 This date seems rather late, and Jonathan Goldberg, for one, has pointed
 out that part of the rhetoric of the very first European explorers
 and colonists involved classifying the native people of color as
 dangerously sexual, even sodomitical. "'They are all sodomites;' so
 reads the dispatch sent from Vera Cruz, July 10, 1519, in the first
 so-called letter of Cort&eacute;z."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Goldberg then argues that "once made, few reports failed to repeat
 the charge [of sodomy]."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Eliot was apparently well aware of these kinds of homophobic anxieties
 about New World discovery, and his Columbo and Bolo verses recall
 these associations only to redeploy them as modernist humor.

<p>
Like so many other modernists on both sides of the Atlantic during
this period&#8212;including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, William Faulkner,
and Ernest Hemingway&#8212;Eliot was fascinated with ventriloquizing
racism. Here Eliot displays the racism of his culture, evidently, taking
pleasure in compulsively reiterating the moral abjection of prejudicial
discourse, while he repeats it with a palpable, self-conscious mockery
that exposes it at its most attenuated and outlandish limits. This is
prohibited language which marks the extremity of what can properly be
spoken. "King Bolo's Big Black Bassturd Kween"&#8212;the most potent
moment of naming in the cycle&#8212;disturbs because of the

<b></b>

element of racial hatred it speaks, while it already troubles that
racism by pointing to its own absurdity, turning the critical glance
back upon itself to disclose more about the speaker than about the
queen. Ventriloquizing as such is a kind of mimicry that takes pleasure
in its model but revolts against it through the modes of mockery and
parody, correcting it while exploiting it.

<p>
This, of course, does not get Eliot "off the hook" of racism. Yet
by troping away from the culturally popular racism of the 1910s and
1920s to critique it while he participates in it, his stance toward
racial difference appears more complicated. While Eliot evokes stock
racist stereotypes that represent the colonies as filled with "savages"
and "cannibals," he also inverts and mocks these stereotypes. In the
extensive anthropological commentary on Bolo and Bolovian customs he
concocts for Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e, Bolo is hardly a "savage." He is the
emblem of all that Eliot deems good about "civilization." Meanwhile,
in the stanza above, "Bolo's big black queen" offers the disruptive
element to the dessert party, but the obscene sexual advance comes from
Columbo's words&#8212;as the representative of European politics and
language&#8212;rather than from her body. Columbo needs no prompting for
his lewdness: he is sexually out of control, and his mission centers
on sex whether he is on board his ship or in the newly discovered
colonies. The white colonial party carries and (quite literally)
disseminates the mark of hyperbolic sexuality, and it is precisely their
sexual ardor that functions as their most potent motivation for mixing
with the native inhabitants. Yet the miscegenation of Columbo and the Big
Black Queen operates less as that worried marker of the meeting and mixing
of races in the last century than it does as a simple, albeit titillating,
historical fact. The stanzas thus offer at least as much judgment on
Columbo as they do on the native queen. That is to say that, if there
is a moral stance to be taken, the obscenity in this instance lies with
Columbo's perception of the queen, and not with the queen herself.

<p>
As Eliot expanded the group of friends to whom he sent the Columbo and
Bolo material, his correspondents responded in turn by affirming the
poems' masturbatory qualities. When Eliot told Wyndham Lewis early in 1915
that he would send him some of his ribald verses, Lewis in turn wrote to
Pound: "He told me he had written a lot of filthy sexual verse, which,
if he sends it, I shall hang in the W.C. He described it as Verlainesque,
damn his shifty little eyes. Well, well."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Pound thought of them this way too: in 1922 Eliot announced he was going
 to send some of his Columbo and Bolo poems to Joyce. Pound retorted,
 "You can forward the Bolo to Joyce if you think it wont unhinge his
 somewhat sabbatarian mind. On the hole he might be saved the shock,
 shaved the sock" [<i>sic</i>] (<i>LOTSE</i>, 505).

<p>
Eliot's willingness to circulate these poems only to male writers,
while simultaneously parodying the queerness of colonial history,
participates in the epistemological pairings of "secrecy/disclosure" and
"public/private" that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has argued are constitutive
of societal structures of gay closeting.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Eliot was both very much in the closet about his queer fascinations,
 and halfway out of the closet because of his willingness to play with
 homoerotic titillation among the members of his coterie. Columbo and
 his men are preoccupied with anal eroticism, and regularly sodomize
 both each other and King Bolo's campily named "Kween." After a graphic
 scene of

<b></b>

masturbation, when Columbo had grown "rooty" from "three weeks at sea,"
Columbo "took his cock in both his hands / And swore it was a beauty"
before pouncing on the cabin boy: "Columbo grasped him by the balls /
And buggered him in the ass-o" (<i>IOTMH</i>,317). In another stanza,
"Columbo slid along the deck / And raped the smoke-room steward."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
Eliot, in fact, seems to have arranged his little coterie much as
coteries had been arranged in literary circles for centuries. As Wendy
Wall writes in her discussion of Renaissance coteries, "the coterie used
the circulation of texts to consolidate the bonds formed among an elite
and primarily male group."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 J.W. Saunders, in turn, argues that the Renaissance coterie functioned
 as:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->. . . a finishing school where members polished each
other's art, which, like the taste for clothes, or the ear for a
compliment, or the aptitude for dancing or fencing or riding, was
very much a matter of doing the right things in the right way, in a
game where every man tried to dazzle and out vie his competitors. More
seriously a group restricted, ideally at least, to those who were equals
or near-equals in social status . . . [they] cooperated in the formulation
of critical principles, a sense of values.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Although Eliot did not explicitly seek criticism from the members of his
coterie for his Columbo and Bolo poems, he certainly sought to "dazzle and
out vie his competitors" with the shocking content of his verses. Indeed,
their circulation participates in and offers a pornotropic extension
of the collaborative effort Eliot made with Pound while crafting <i>The
Waste Land</i>, a collaboration that Wayne Koestenbaum and others have
read as emphatically homoerotic.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Their "dazzle" involves what I want to call <i>epistological</i>
 titillation: the poems evoke the pornographic comic strip to try to
 shock and impress his male peers with the language of obscenity. There
 does not, however, appear to have been a commensurate response from all
 of his male friends, who, apart from Pound and Dobr&eacute;e, did not
 reciprocate <i>epistologically</i> in the game of shock and titillation.

<p>
As I have suggested, Columbo's principal crewmembers are just as "obscene"
as Columbo himself, including the cabin boy, the bosun, and the chaplain
(a version of Charlie Chaplin in an early letter to Aiken, <i>LOTSE,</i>
126). Eliot's rendition of colonial exploration thus imagines a
pronounced sexual affiliation among sailors that extends the tradition
of homoerotic "comradeship" found in sailor fiction. For the most part,
the Cuban natives also share the same propensity to anal and excessive
eroticism as the colonists, and Columbo's crew thus find uncannily queer
mirrors of themselves in the colonies. Offering an inverted version of
Bhabhan mimicry, in which the colonized subject responds "through the
repetition of <i>partial presence</i>" to "the narcissistic demand of
colonial authority," King Bolo and his Queen seem to belonga priori to
the same confraternity of anal and scatological eroticism.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 The stanzas thus level difference by writing the colonial
 encounter as one in which a radical commensurability and sameness of
 desires&#8212;the game of sex&#8212;overrides dissimilarities of race,
 language, custom, history, region, and religion.

<p>
Yet the poems never once offer explicit judgment on their homosexual
practices, and Eliot simply constructs queerness as intrinsic to the
cycle.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 The poems are a version

<b></b>

of Eliot's sexual discovery, charting the evolution of a queer poetics
through an allegory of New World discovery. In only one instance does
the speaker self-reflexively comment on the obscenity of the explorers,
and this happens when the cabin boy Orlandino is accused by the narrator
of "obscene" <i>language</i>:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
A child of upright character
<br />
But his language was obscene-o.
<br />
'Fuck Spiders' was his chief remark
<br />
In accents mild and dulcet.
<br />
They asked him what there was for lunch
<br />
And he simply answered 'Bullshit.'
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>IOTMH</i>,316)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Interestingly, the censorious comment does not cite the violently
sexual or scatological <i>acts</i>, but notes the obscene <i>words</i>
of one of the younger characters. Eliot is establishing a dichotomous
and discontinuous set of values between the imagined narrator of these
verses and the res who inhabit them: the speaker complains that
Orlandino's language is obscene even though the stanzas themselves
contain language much more hyperbolically so, thereby creating a
<i>mise en ab&icirc;me</i> that testifies to the almost endless play of
possible allegories which these stanzas offer. Meanwhile, Orlandino's
<i>character</i> is considered "upright" despite the fact that he is one
of the more overtly queer characters in the poems&#8212;in a stanza Eliot
sent to Aiken in September 1914, "the cabin boy was sav'd alive / and
bugger'd, in the sphincter" (<i>LOTSE</i>,59). This valence continues,
especially if we take into account the unpublished stanzas at Yale,
which are even more expressly homoerotic than those published so far.

<p>
In his first Columbo and Bolo letter to Aiken, cited above, Eliot
also mocks the projects of anthropology, history, and the academic
establishment in general. He glosses his Columbo and Bolo poem to write:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The bracketed portions we owe to the restorations of the editor,
Prof. Dr. Hasenpfeffer (Halle), with the assistance of his two inseparable
friends, Dr. Hans Frigger (the celebrated poet) and Herr Schnitzel
(aus Wien). How much we owe to the hardwon intuition of this truly great
scholar! The editor also justly observes: 'There seems to be a <i>double
entendre</i> about the last two lines, but the fine flavour of the jest
has not survived the centuries.'&#8212;Yet we hope that such genius as
his may penetrate even this enigma. Was it really the custom to drink
ice-cream soda just before lunch? Prof. Dr. Hasenpfeffer insists that
it was. Prof. Dr. Krapp (Jena) believes that the phrase is euphemistic
(<i>LOTSE</i>,42).
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "double-entendre" refers, of course, to homosexuality, and Eliot
mocks the phony earnestness that can attend academic labor. Eliot's
disillusionment with the scholarly life began in full force while he was
in Germany, and his stock German professorial res function as yet
another caricature in this collection of poems. Academia, he suggests,
is a dirty pursuit of the parenthetical, the excised, and the obscure. He
writes a remarkable body of pornotropic poetry, then laughs at us for
considering it.

2 Desiring Publicity: <br />Eliot as the Kween of Golder's Green
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Given the strikingly bawdy character of these poems, it is also remarkable
that Eliot actively tried to get the Bolo poems published. As it turns
out, they are, <i>prima faccia</i>, the first <i>face</i> that Eliot
wanted to show the world. After having participated <i>epistologically</i>
in a teasing mimicry of <i>Blast</i>&#8212;desiring inclusion within
its moment&#8212;Eliot sent several Columbo and Bolo stanzas to Wyndham
Lewis early in 1915 for the second (and, what would be the last) issue
of <i>Blast</i>. Lewis, however, rejected them, along with some of
Eliot's other racy poems, "The Triumph of Bullshit," and "Ballade pour
la grosse Lulu," which did not end up seeing publication until Ricks's
<i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> in 1996. Lewis wrote to Pound to
justify his decision: "Eliot has sent me Bullshit and the Ballad for Big
Louise. They are excellent bits of scholarly ribaldry. I am trying to
print them in <i>Blast</i>, but stick to my naif determination to have no
'words ending in -Uck, -Unt, and -Ugger.'"
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Eliot reacted right away by writing a letter of complaint to Pound in
February 1915:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I have corresponded with Lewis, but his puritanical principles seem to
bar my way to Publicity. I fear that King Bolo and his Big Black Kween
will never burst into print. I understand that Priapism, Narcissism
etc. are not approved of, and even so innocent a rhyme as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . pulled her stockings off
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a frightful cry of 'Hauptbahnhof!!'
<br />
is considered decadent.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTSE</i>,86)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot transforms Lewis's queasiness about offensive language into a
teasing charge that Lewis's "puritanical principles" would keep Eliot
from finding the "Publicity" he desires. Lewis did, however,publish
some of Eliot's other verse ("Preludes" and "Rhapsody of a Windy Night"
[<i>sic</i>]) in <i>Blast</i>.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Did Eliot consider "Preludes" and "Rhapsody" insufficient for the
 "Publicity" he hoped to achieve? Or did he find out after his
 complaining letter to Pound that Lewis would include these two
 poems? Was he hoping that obscenity would do the "publicity-work"
 for him?

<p>
The young Eliot was hoping for a bit of capital "P" "Publicity" from
the Columbo and Bolo poems, and he imagined them as his first "burst"
onto the London literary scene. His desire for publication at this time
was "keen," and he was willing to risk being dangerously flamboyant to
find the publicity he wanted. Importantly, in his complaint to Pound,
Eliot gives an exact echo of the language he uses in the Columbo and
Bolo verses when he describes the queen's mode of presenting herself;
he suggests that his poems cannot "burst" upon the literary scene with
the same ease that Bolo's "big black queen" "burst" onboard or "burst"
upon the party of colonists "drinking ice cream soda." As elsewhere in
his letters, especially to Pound, Eliot proposes that if writing is a
sexual act, then publishing is its ejaculative fulfillment. Indeed, Eliot
seemed to enjoy the valences of "burst[ing]" into print a great deal,
and the term recurs in 1922 when he is about to publish <i>The Waste
Land</i> in the first issue of his new journal, <i>The Criterion</i>. In
this instance the tables are turned, and he gives Lewis a back seat,
writing to Pound: "I think that if the <i>Waste Land</i> [<i>sic</i>]
bursts out in the first number

<b></b>

and you contribute to the second, that Lewis must remain behind the
scenes until the third" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 553).

<p>
After he was rejected by Lewis, Eliot persisted in seeking publication for
the Bolo poems for a number of years. Even as late as May 1921 Eliot was
still hoping that the Bolo poems would find public circulation. Although
he did not know Joyce well, he offers him a sample of the Columbo and
Bolo poems in a letter of May, 1921. He enviously writes to Joyce after
having had a "taste" of the <i>Ulysses</i> manuscript for which he claims
to have "nothing but admiration," particularly for the bawdy sections,
confessing (as did others), "I wish, for my own sake, that I had not
read it" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 455). He compliments Joyce on the news that
"even a limited and very expensive edition is to appear," asking "has it
been properly circularised in England?" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 455). He admits
that he has been having difficulty himself finding the publication and
publicity he desired for his own "limited edition":



<blockquote>

ballad on the life of Christopher Columbus and his friend King Bolo, but

<blockquote>

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>




<blockquote>
<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTS0E</i>, 455)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Eliot thus draws an analogy between <i>Ulysses</i> and the Columbo
and Bolo cycle. He had already asserted a serious admiration for the
scandalous sections of <i>Ulysses</i> in 1919, writing to John Quinn,
friend, New York lawyer and patron of the arts, "I should like to do
everything I can about it over here. The part of <i>Ulysses</i> in
question struck me as almost the finest I have read: I have lived on it
ever since I read it" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 314). The ribaldry of the scandalous,
masturbatory homoerotic sections of <i>Ulysses</i> are not unlike that of
Eliot's verse, and part of Eliot's frustrated admiration for Joyce could
be due to the fact that Eliot met the censor <i>before</i> publication
and "publicity," while Joyce met the censor after both publication and
the immense publicity that is scandal.

<p>
As he will do elsewhere, in Eliot's letter to Joyce he blurs the
distinction between his "epic ballad" and "Bolo's big black bastard
queen:" both it (his poem) and she (the queen) are "so obscene" that
they "shocked the folk of Golder's Green." Eliot thus makes Bolo's
big black queen perform the allegorical work of obscenity; that is,
she functions as a fictional objective correlative for his own desires
for publicity. In his letter to Joyce Eliot draws on the shock-value
of race and sex as markers of disruption in the precious atmosphere of
suburban London and applies them to his unpublishable poetry. In effect,
he constructs a tautologous narrative about his inability to publish:
the disruptive elements of color and sex are too obscene for the "folk
of Golder's Green;" because these elements are in the poems, no one will
publish them; therefore both the poems and he himself are as obscene as
the "big black queen."

<p>
In a letter to Conrad Aiken of 1916, Eliot included two more Columbo and
Bolo stanzas as a gloss on his current situation. Here, as elsewhere,
he explicitly uses the Columbo and Bolo poems to allegorize details of
his own biography:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The news is that I am to be at Highgate School, near town, next term,
that I am starting to rewrite my thesis, that my wife has been very ill,
that I have been taken up with the worries of finance and Vivien's health,
that my friend Jean Verdenal [to whom he dedicated the <i>Prufrock</i>
volume in 1917] has been killed, that nothing has been seen of Armstrong
who is now a captain in Kitchener's army, that compulsion is coming in,
that my putative publisher will probably be conscripted, that we are
very blue about the war, that living is going up, and that

</blockquote>

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Cardinal Bessarian.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTSE</i>, 125)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
King Bolo's queen has by this time moved from Cuba to London, to the
fashionable, Jewish neighborhood of Golder's Green, and she is on display
as a dancer, paired with a powerful Catholic religious representative. But
what work is this queen doing for Eliot? Her status as a foreigner of
color with no proper parentage would mark her as a "bassturd" in the
strictures of British society of the time, while Eliot again implies
that the queen is not female at all, but is in fact a male "queen" or
"fairy" in drag. Reminiscent of the women in "The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock," whose arms are "downed with light brown hair," (Lines 62-63),
Bolo's queen is even more hirsute, lacking subtlety but still warranting
the dialogue between erotic attraction and physical repulsion that we
find in "Prufrock"&#8212;suggesting an androgyny verging on transgenderism
which the queerness of Eliot's cycle would support.

<p>
In the same letter to Aiken, Eliot continues by claiming, "I am
<i>keen</i> about rhymes ending in -een," and he attaches the following
stanza:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
King Bolo's big black bassturd kween
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her taste was kalm and klassic
<br />
And as for anything obscene
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;She said it made her ass sick.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>

<p align="right">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>LOTSE</i>, 125)
<!--_/attribution-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot here takes a linguistic step to incorporate himself into his poems,
playing with sound and meaning by alluding to his feeling of being "keen"
for the "een" sound, and thereby effectively, performatively, enfolding
himself into their rhyme scheme, and into the poems themselves. It is
as if he himself is an extension of the "-een" rhymes in his cycle,
or as if he were just as <i>queer</i> as his verses&#8212;as if he just
might be the "kween of Golder's Green." Invoking sodomitical metaphors
to insist on the queen's distaste for obscenity&#8212;"anything obscene"
"made her ass sick"&#8212;he again proposes that it is not, in fact,
the queen who is obscene, but the cultural dispensation that deems the
fact of her large, queer, blackness obscene, and it is the "folk of
Golder's Green" who are the markers and makers of obscenity.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
The black queen is simultaneously a racist portrayal, a point
of titillation, and a satire on racist, sexist, and homophobic
formulations. She functions as the mark of difference in the middle-class
culture of Golder's Green at a moment when even foreignness

<b></b>

was akin to obscenity, and the Jewish suburb did not necessarily give
shelter to other displaced groups. Eliot himself felt an unwelcome
foreigner in London&#8212;he was classless in British society,
and practically parentless at this time as well, since he had "fled"
family when he left America straining relations with his father. In his
letters, Eliot was preoccupied with "foreignness," and already in 1914
when studying in Germany, wrote to Conrad Aiken, "I think that this will
be a very pleasant exile on the whole,&#8212;though I cannot look upon
a summer in Germany as anything but an exile" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 41). This
attitude changes very little during the first years in England, and
he writes to his cousin Eleanor Hinkley in the fall of 1914, "I don't
think that I should ever feel at home in England, as I do for instance
in France . . . I should always, I think, be aware of a certain sense
of confinement in England, and repression" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 61). In a
letter to Mary Hutchinson of 1919 he writes, "but remember that I am
a <i>metic</i>&#8212;a foreigner, and that I <i>want</i> to understand
you, and all the background and tradition of you" (<i>LOTSE</i>, 318).

<p>
Instead of finding the publicity he desired for them, Eliot shared the
Bolo poems privately over the years, usually as a satiric way to negotiate
his dealings with the public world of publishing and notoriety, and the
very private world of his identity as an &eacute;migr&eacute;. Instead
of the Bolo poems, Eliot's first publications, all in 1915, were "The
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," "The Boston Evening Transcript,"
"Aunt Helen," and "Cousin Nancy" in <i>Poetry</i>, "Preludes" and
"Rhapsody on a Windy Night" in <i>Blast</i>, and "Portrait of a Lady"
in <i>Others</i>. At the beginning of 1915 he was a young struggling
poet, lucky to be befriended by the more established Ezra Pound. At the
end of the year he was on his way to becoming <i>the</i> T. S. Eliot,
the author who would be canonized by the <i>Dial</i> prize in 1922, the
subject of intense critical attention in magazines and reviews of the
1910s and early 1920s, and then the canonical re constructed by the
New Criticism of the late 1920s and 1930s. These became the early basis of
Eliot's reputation, and began to shape the character of English modernism.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
3 Eliot's <i>Parergon</i>
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
How can we negotiate the fact of these poems alongside the body of
Eliot's published material? We might think of the Columbo and Bolo poems
as a pornotropic <i>parergon</i> for Eliot's work. The term is borrowed
from Conrad Aiken's allusion to the Bolo poems in a short essay called
"King Bolo and Others" that he wrote to celebrate the occasion of Eliot's
sixtieth birthday for a volume of tributes collected in 1948. Aiken's
piece actually gives scant attention to the Bolo poems, but refers to them
as a knowing insider, participating in the closeting of Eliot's verses
that had by now been going on through his career. It is unlikely that any
other contributor to the collection, with the exception of Clive Bell,
knew the content of these verses.

<p>
Although he does not elaborate with a sample from the Columbo and Bolo
verses, Aiken does give a rather interesting brief interpretation of the
import of the Bolo poems to Eliot's oeuvre. He reminisces about their
days together at Harvard:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What did we talk about? or what didn't we? It was the first "great"
era of the comic strip, of Krazy Kat, and Mutt and Jeff, and Rube
Goldberg's elaborate lunacies: it was also perhaps the most creative
period of American slang, and in both these departments of invention
he took enormous pleasure. How delighted we were with the word "dinge"
for negro! This rich native creativeness was to be reflected, of course,
in his poetry, notably in Prufrock . . .
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliding the boundaries between the humor of the comic strip and racist
"slang," Aiken brings racism and humor together under the single banner
of undergraduate delight. But where did Aiken get this slang from? Why
were he and Eliot so excited to borrow racist humor and terminology? As
Hortense Spiller proposes, they would not have <i>known</i> many blacks,
but "what they did know was that 'dinge' named a limit, a neologism and,
therefore, an unnamable, beyond representability."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 These poems also offer the mnemonic trace of Eliot's American
 identity. Turning to an allegory of New World discovery precisely at
 the moment he was choosing the Old World over the New himself, these
 poems worry the limits of Eliot's self-representation as a racial other,
 and his genealogical history as an American.

<p>
Aiken continues his tribute by asserting that Eliot's delight in slang
and comic-book characters "gave rise to the series of hilariously naughty
<i>parerga</i> which was devoted spasmodically to that singular and
sterling character known as King Bolo, not to mention King Bolo's Queen,
'that airy fairy hairy&#8212;'un, who led the dance on Golder's Green
with Cardinal Bessarion'" (<i>TSEAS</i>, 22). Quoting from Eliot's 1916
letter, Aiken over thirty years later again effaces race and obscenity
from the equation to portray the "queen" simply as "Bolo's Queen" rather
than his "big black queen." He thus teases his fellow contributors by
offering what could only seem a silly, sophomoric-sounding rhyme without
context&#8212;evacuating accountability and precluding the possibility
that his audience might decipher the meaning of these allusions.

<p>
Aiken's notion that the poems operate as <i>parerga</i> is, though,
a fitting metaphor: the poems are precisely "an extra ornament in art"
(<i>OED</i>) insofar as the <i>parergon</i> is always that which can
surprise us and tell us more about what we deem to be central to the
text (whether literary or otherwise) than the center itself. Derrida
articulates it in this way:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
A parergon comes against, beside, and in addition to the <i>ergon</i>,
the work done [<i>fait</i>], the fact [<i>lefait</i>], the work, but
it does not fall to one side, it touches and cooperates within the
operation, from a certain outside. Neither simply outside nor simply
inside. Like an accessory that one is obliged to welcome on the border,
on board [<i>aubord, &agrave; bord</i>]. It is first of all the on (the)
bo(a)rd(er) [<i>Il est d'abord l'&agrave;-bord</i>].
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot's Columbo and Bolo poems situate themselves for us on the
"border" or the boundary of his other canonical poems, touching them by
illuminating the limits of interpretation; neither entirely "outside
nor simply inside," they "inscribe[] something which comes as an
extra, <i>exterior</i> to the proper field . . . but whose transcendent
exteriority comes to play, abut onto, brush against, rub, press against
the limit itself and intervene in the inside only to the extent that
the inside is lacking."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 The pornotropic poems surprise us, illuminating and foregrounding
 Eliot's obsessions with sexuality,

<b></b>

race, and the corporeal, revealing a complicated sexual imagination. In
his birthday tribute, Aiken insists on the Bolo poems' value as
social and academic critique: "These admirable stanzas, notable at
times for their penetrating social criticisms were to continue for
years as a sort of cynical counterpoint to the study of Sanskrit and
the treatise on epistemology. Their influence on the development of
a Style will no doubt come in due course to the attention of Herr Dr
Krapp of Wien" (<i>TSEAS</i>, 22). Again, Aiken's audience of fellow
contributors&#8212;not to mention his readers&#8212;would have had no
idea what he was talking about: who might "Herr Dr Krapp" be exactly? As
it turns out, he is us: academic scholars who are only now uncovering
these poems to give them critical attention. Eliot writes a bawdy
<i>parergon</i> to his poems, and then laughs at us for considering it,
embracing us into the fold of humor and titillation as its newest objects
of satire.

Ricks chose his title from the provisional one that Eliot had given
his poetry notebook from 1909-1917, even though at a certain point Eliot
scratched through his title with single solid strokes, effectively placing
his title under erasure. <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> was more of
a notebook than a book, and Eliot makes only one other known reference
to it in a letter to Conrad Aiken in 1914 when he jokes, "Do you think
it possible, if I brought out the "Inventions of the March Hare," and
gave a few lectures, at 5 P.M. with wax candles, that I could become a
sentimental Tommy" (T. S. Eliot, <i>The Letters of T. S. Eliot. Volume
One, 1898-1922</i>, ed. Valerie Eliot [New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988],
59. Hereafter referred to as <i>LOTSE</i>). Eliot's comment to Aiken
says much about the degree to which he was able to mock his own poetic
endeavors at this early stage of his career.

<p>
On the Bolo poems see Jonathan Gill, "Protective Coloring: Modernism and
Blackface Minstrelsy in the Bolo Poems", in <i>T.S. Eliot's Orchestra:

Garland, 2000), 65-84. Gill charts evocative similarities between these
stanzas and blackface minstrelsy, arguing that Eliot's poems might
be situated directly in this tradition. The essay is illuminating,
but scarcely takes up the crucial question of Eliot's stance towards
race and racism in these poems, even though his argument concerns the
theatrical performance of blackness.

<p>
As terms that share their provenance in the cultural upheavals of the
first half of the twentieth century, "modernism" and "documentary"
nevertheless appear to belong to distinct art- historical, literary,
and aesthetic domains. As we have come to understand them, they seem
to indicate opposed sets of beliefs about the nature of artistic
communication, to embody different assumptions about the artwork's
public role, and in many cases to represent strongly divergent political
commitments on the part of their practitioners. Modernist artists and
writers, as commonplace has it, attacked the conventions of mimetic
visual and literary representation, laying bare the semiotic, social,
and psychological conventions that allowed traditional artworks to be
seen as verisimilar pictures of reality. Modernists interrogated the
ways in which subjective perception and thought mediated any possible
apprehension of the world, and they sought to account for the decisive
material role that media such as language, paint, and bodily movement
played in articulating the artwork's relation to reality. From this basic
stance of modernist artists, ultimately, derived many of the defining
features of the modernist artwork: its tendency towards difficulty,
fragmentation, and abstraction; its self-reflexivity and heightened
self-consciousness; its prominent display of artistic technique; its
polemical, often mandarin withdrawal from everyday life and culture.

<p>
Documentary, in contrast, seemed to draw its energy and inspiration from
the antithetical realm of the everyday, the popular world upon which
modernist art and writing had demonstratively

<b></b>

turned its back. In reportage, reports, photographs, and films, the
documentary artist attempted to register the teeming multiplicity of
movements of labor, daily routine, and city life. Honesty, accuracy,
and openness to the contingent details of the empirical world were
premium values in the documentary aesthetic, and objectively existing
"reality" its formal touchstone. In pursuing its goal of representing
reality truly, documentary took up the aspirations of nineteenth-century
artists, both realist and naturalist, to reveal the face of the common
life that less rigorous modes of art tended to mask. Documentary,
in sum, is frequently thought to represent the furthest development
of naturalism in the arts, just as modernism, its aesthetic antipode,
is seen as the acme of anti-naturalist impulses.

<p>
This story is familiar to the point of near-banality, and like most
folk wisdom, it has the virtue of being plausible if not precisely
true. Once it is given closer scrutiny, however, several problems nag
this account. First, evidently, the basic terms upon which it rests
are unstable and difficult to define with precision: for example, the
opposition of modernism's "subjectivity" to documentary's "objectivity,"
and of "modernism" itself to the "realism" and/or "naturalism" with which
documentary is aligned. It is pertinent to recall here Roman Jakobson's
terminological scruples concerning the multiple senses of "realism"
and easy to concur with him that "those who speak of artistic realism
continually sin against it."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Yet I want to pursue a somewhat different line of theoretical
 and historical argument than such terminological skepticism. In
 the conceptual frameworks taking shape around both modernism and
 documentary, I wish to suggest, formally innovative experimentalism
 and naturalistic explorations of everyday life were not so much
 opposed as instead <i>complementary</i> moments of a broader modernist
 poetics. Only from this perspective, I argue, do the mixtures of radical
 montage, reportage, state- or commercially-oriented advertising,
 and surrealist defamiliarization in the documentary works of John
 Grierson's filmmaking team and the texts of Mass Observation reveal
 their underlying coherence. Similarly, such a perspective, which implies
 that documentary arose in close relation to the later development of
 modernism in the late 1920s and 1930s, helps explain the significant
 presence of modernist writers, visual artists, and musicians in the
 documentary film movement and the amateur ethnographic organization
 called Mass Observation.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 These movements involved such modernistically oriented writers as
 Charles Madge, David Gascoyne, William Empson, Kathleen Raine,
 Naomi Mitchison, W.H. Auden, and even E.M. Forster; artists,
 photographers, and experimental filmmakers such as Humphrey Jennings,
 Julian Trevelyan, Humphrey Spender, and Len Lye; and musicians such
 as Benjamin Britten. On the part of those modernists not directly
 associated with the institutions of documentary, documentary culture
 was nevertheless followed with intense interest. For example, journals
 such as <i>Close-Up</i>, which involved such writers as H.D., Bryher,
 and Dorothy Richardson, offered readers critical discussions of
 Vertov's and Eisenstein's most recent productions. Similarly, Eugene
 Jolas's Paris-based expatriate journal <i>transition</i> set stills
 from Paul Strand's <i>Nets</i> and L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy's
 <i>English Zoo Architecture</i> alongside the latest installments of
 Joyce's <i>Work in Progress</i>, translations of stories and poems by
 Franz Kafka and Gottfried Benn, and visual works by Joan Mir&ograve;
 and Marcel Duchamp.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
A useful theoretical point of departure for considering the
interconnections of modernism and documentary is the writings of the
communist philosopher and literary critic, Georg Luk&aacute;cs, one of
the most important critics of modernism and a formidable advocate of
classical and socialist realism. In his 1958 study, <i>The Meaning of
Contemporary Realism</i>, Luk&aacute;cs identifies the first "modernistic"
break with realism&#8212;in his view, regrettable&#8212;not with the
manifestly modernist writings of Kafka, Joyce, Benn, and Musil, but
already a generation or two earlier, with the naturalism of Zola. He goes
on to attack critics who glorify modernism, damning them for failing to
distinguish between realism and naturalism. He writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->. . . this distinction depends on the presence or absence
in a work of art of a "hierarchy of significance" in the situations
and characters presented. Compared with this, formal categories are
of secondary importance. That is why it is possible to speak of the
basically <i>naturalistic</i> character of modernist literature . . . the
particular form this principle of naturalistic arbitrariness, this lack
of hierarchic structure, may take is not decisive. We encounter it in
the all-determining "social conditions" of naturalism, in symbolism's
impressionist methods and its cultivation of the exotic, in the
fragmentation of objective reality in futurism and constructivism and
the German <i>NeueSachlichkeit</i>, or, again, in surrealism's stream
of consciousness.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Rather than dismissing Luk&aacute;cs's naturalism-modernism continuum as
a dark night in which all cows are gray or accepting his anti-modernist
evaluative spin, I wish to explore his hypothesis somewhat against the
grain of his intentions and to draw out its implications. Luk&aacute;cs's
pinpointing of the "basically naturalistic character of modernist
literature," I suggest, offers a way to understand modernism and
documentary as complementary and, at the same time, helps reveal
the ambivalence within documentary poetics between "realist" social
representation and "naturalistic-modernistic" erosion of this
representational "hierarchy of significance."

<p>
Luk&aacute;cs's critique hinges on the key role of socially significant
"types" in realism and the displacement of typicality in both naturalism
and modernism, through the hypostatization of the particular and
the detail. He develops this argument by way of commentary on Walter
Benjamin's theory of allegory, which he takes as reflecting modernism's
ideologically conditioned failure to grasp the real as rational, from
the perspective of a substantive totality (represented for Luk&aacute;cs
by official communist Marxism):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In realistic literature each descriptive detail is both <i>individual</i>
and <i>typical</i>. Modern allegory and modernist ideology, however,
deny the <i>typical</i>. By destroying the coherence of the world,
they reduce detail to the level of mere particularity (once again,
the connection between modernism and naturalism is plain). Detail,
in its allegorical transferability, though brought into a direct, if
paradoxical connection with transcendence, becomes an abstract function of
the transcendence to which it points. Modernist literature thus replaces
concrete typicality with abstract particularity.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
A remark by Luk&aacute;cs's heterodox Soviet contemporary, Viktor
Shklovsky, associated with the left modernist groups "Lef" and "New Lef"
in the 1920s, suggests that one

<b></b>

could employ this basic distinction even without endorsing Luk&aacute;cs's
prescriptive demand to suppress modernism and reconstruct realism. Thus,
in a symposium on Soviet documentary in 1927, which included Sergei
Tretiakov, Esther Shub, Osip Brik, and Shklovsky, the formalist literary
critic and screenplay writer appealed to a historical dialectic of
modernist form and naturalistic actuality of content to establish the
tasks of current Soviet film. Rather than such typical oppositions
as fiction and non-fiction or, by extension, realist and modernistic
treatment of the film narrative, Shklovsky emphasized the intensive
engagement with new "raw material" as that which would advance Soviet
film work in both its aesthetic character and its social function:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What Shub is doing and Dziga Vertov is getting ready to do has a huge
number of analogies in literature . . . We should not exaggerate the
fictional side of art. The fact of fiction is established, but art
periodically undergoes a re-emphasis on raw material. And the mistaken
newsreel-makers were right about this and they are right now when they
promote raw material. The priority of material is the result . . . Lef's
task is broader than the problem of the fiction and non-fiction film. Our
problem is the priority of raw material.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Shklovsky thus saw the documentary film in the same broadly modernistic
framework as he viewed literature in his formalist criticism.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Filmic expression, documentary and fictional, he was arguing, needed
 regular freshening through "defamiliarizing" means. These means
 included <i>both</i> new stylistic "devices" and the disturbing force
 of up-to-date, often "low" social contents appropriated directly from
 extra-artistic domains ("raw materials"). Or to put it more abstractly,
 in Shklovsky's theory of literary and filmic innovation, "modernistic"
 and "naturalistic" impulses appear equally valuable and complementary,
 not antithetical.

<p>
In his review of Paul Rotha's book <i>Documentary Film</i> for the 19
February, 1936, issue of <i>The Listener</i>, W. H. Auden specifically
pointed to precisely the problem of the "realistic" typical narratives
and "naturalistic-modernistic" particulars as an unresolved tension
in the documentary form. Indeed, in an almost Luk&aacute;csian fashion
(though terminologically more loose), Auden drew out the contradictions
between two forms of "realism": realism as verisimilitude and realism
as close mimetic reproduction of real things. He begins: "The only
genuine meaning of the word 'documentary' is true-to-life. Any gesture,
any expression, any dialogue or sound effect, any scenery that strikes
the audience as true-to-life is documentary, whether obtained in the
studio or on location."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 He goes on to note, however, that "because of the irreversibility and
 continuous unvaried movement of the film, it is not the best medium
 for factual information . . . The effect of a film is to create a
 powerful emotional attitude towards the material presented" ("DF,"
 355). Finally, he notes, "because of the mass of realistic detail which
 the camera records, no medium has ever been invented which is so well
 suited to portray individual character, and so badly suited to the
 portrayal of types. On the screen you never see <i>a</i> man digging in
 <i>a</i> field, but always Mr. Macgregor digging in a ten acre meadow"
 ("DF," 355).

<p>
Although Auden does not fully spell out the consequences of his critical
caveats to the documentary aesthetic, his implication is clear enough. On
the one hand, insofar

<b></b>

as the term "documentary" lays claim to the verisimilitude of classical
realism, it must give up its adherence to a photographically grounded
naturalism which captures events in real time and on location (since
true-to-life "documentary" representations could just as easily be
made in the studio). Yet insofar as the documentarists insisted on
the precise registration of details, especially photographically and
cinematographically, they verged over into the emotionally intense, often
surreal depiction of the autonomous fragment of reality characteristic of
radical naturalism and modernism alike. Rotha himself, it should be noted,
argued strongly against the tendency of the documentary mode to fragment
into striking details, thus taking on modernistic, aestheticizing features
to the detriment of its social function. Accordingly, he criticized
"Continental Realists" such as Walter Ruttmann and Dziga Vertov for their
"superficial," "pseudo-realist" treatment of the rhythms and movements
of the city, and he rejected conventional visual beauty in favor of a
new aesthetic of factuality and social aim:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Beauty is one of the greatest dangers to documentary. Beauty of
individual shots is not only insufficient but frequently harmful to
the significant expression of content. Beauty of purely natural things. . . is unimportant unless related to purpose and theme. Beauty of
symphonic and rhythmic movement is . . .nothing in itself. What is
important is beauty of idea, fact, and achievement, none of which have
anything to do with the actual filming of individual shots.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet Rotha's polemic, whatever the merits of his position, at the same time
points to the precise sore spot that Auden touched upon. The documentary,
Rotha and Auden imply, is potentially torn between two basic aesthetic
tendencies: a "realist" typicality that allows the documentary to be
"true-to-life" and hence socially functional; and a naturalistic or
modernist particularity of the photographically rendered detail, which
threatens to overrun verisimilitude in favor of the effective emotional
or aesthetic impact of the image.

<p>
One of the most apparent sites in which one can observe this tense
complementarity of modernist and documentary modes is the new prose
poem genre that emerged in the 1930s in the work of writers involved
with the documentary and Mass Observation movements. Broadly speaking,
this prose poem was surrealist in its inspiration, yet this surrealism
was in turn decisively shaped by these writers' idiosyncratic reading of
the documentary aesthetic, particularly their filtering of it through
Marcel Duchamp's use of everyday objects in his "readymades." Kathleen
Raine, in assessing the successes and failures of the Mass Observation
movement, has suggested that it provided a point of convergence between
the rational and the irrational, the objective and the dream-like in a
single fund of images. She went on to single out David Gascoyne, along
with Charles Madge and Humphrey Jennings, as Mass Observation participants
who had realized a poetry based on such a convergence, "in which an
imagery of precise and objective realism, gathered from the daily human
(and therefore especially urban) scene . . . is informed with a content
not only supremely imaginative, but infused with the imagination of the
collective mind of which it is an eloquent, if unconscious, expression."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Raine, no doubt, has in mind particularly the "reports" of Jennings and

<b></b>

Madge and the analogous prose poetry of Gascoyne. There are, however,
significant differences between these three poets' work within the
basic genre of the surrealist prose poem&#8212;differences that relate
closely to how they interpret the conjunction of surrealism, readymade,
and document, which spans their poetic and documentary activities. In what
follows, I will consider in greater detail the work of these three poets
and documentary artists, concluding with a discussion of the analogous
writing of a fourth artist, the filmmaker and animator Len Lye.

<p>
In September of 1937, Humphrey Jennings&#8212;poet, documentary filmmaker,
surrealist painter, and founding member of the fledgling ethnographic
movement Mass Observation&#8212;was charged with the task of writing
up the results of the surveys and reports done by the Mass Observers on
the recent events of Coronation Day, 12 May. Typical of these reports,
in both the scene observed and the style in which it is presented,
was the following, out of London:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Lancaster Gate. 2.20. Kensington Garden shut, full of soldiers, girls
leaning over park railings calling to them, soldiers indicate guards at
gate despairingly. Indians arguing in tube about the necessity of the
Bakerloo extension to Stanmore, one says, "People in suburbs are scarcely
human, they should be kept as far out of London as possible." Every time
train enters tunnel people make animal noises. Others unscrew light-bulbs;
they are all doing the sort of things Undergraduates do when canned,
but they are not Undergraduates, they seem to be aged between about 25
and 35 and they look like clerks, typists, etc. Terrific jam at Oxford
Circus, takes about 15 minutes to get up escalators. Singing coming from
every part of Oxford Street. Fruit barrows, sellers of rosettes and
newpapers, no motors. People camping on the pavement all the way down
Regent Street, four deep from the pavement edge. Young man to girls,
"Hey, have you got to go home tonight?"&#8212;This seems to be the most
frequent question asked, answer always in the negative; apparently even
in moments of great excitement people are still thinking of their homes
as their centres of life.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This report appeared along with hundreds of others in the Mass Observation
edited volume <i>May the Twelfth</i>, published under the prestigious
Faber and Faber imprint. Presented as a slice of life captured in a
moment of intense "actuality," it bristles with paratactic energies and
estranges the banal urban landscape with surreal bundles of isolated
sights, sounds, faces, and voices. About a year before the Coronation
Day events, Jennings had published another report, the first of the
three short paragraphs collected together under the generic title
"Three Reports":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The conditions for this race, the most important of the Classic races
for three-year old fillies, were ideal, for the weather was fine and
cool. About one o'clock the Aurora again appeared over the hills in a
south direction presenting a brilliant mass of light. Once again Captain
Allison made a perfect start, for the field was sent away well for the
first time that they approached the tapes. It was always evident that
the most attenuated light of the

<b></b>

Aurora sensibly dimmed the stars, like a thin veil drawn over them. We
frequently listened for any sound proceeding from this phenomenon,
but never heard any.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the Mass Observation report, however, this text appeared in a
literary magazine, in the "Double Surrealist Number" of the journal
<i>Contemporary Poetry and Prose</i>.

<p>
Both passages lay claim to the genre of "report," which suggests a
correlation between the order of the text and the order of events and a
descriptive fidelity to a real situation witnessed by an observer. The
Mass Observation report, for all its paratactical disjointedness, is a
coherent fragment of urban experience, a temporally and spatially limited,
perspectival view of an extraordinary event. Whatever broader context or
narrative completion might be possible for any individual bit, it will
receive from the organized accumulation of other reports&#8212;from
"more than two hundred observers" in London, Lancashire, Cambridge,
Swansea and elsewhere&#8212;and from the editorial synthesis seeking
to frame the individual reports into a verbal mosaic of collective
experience. In contrast, Jennings's poetic report on the horserace has
little of the telegraphic breakup of narrative and syntax found in the
observer's rapid jottings. Its diction seems contrivedly literary and a
little dated: "It was always evident that the most attenuated light of the
Aurora sensibly dimmed the stars, like a thin veil drawn over them." Yet
the difficulties the text poses us as readers are far greater than the
fractured report of the Coronation Day observer&#8212;basic difficulties
of context and significance, of the very status of the text generically
and ontologically.

<p>
Jennings's prose poem appeared among several other instances in the same
special surrealist number of <i>Contemporary Poetry and Prose</i>. For
example, immediately preceding Jennings's reports were four prose works
of various characters and qualities. First came a page-long excerpt
from Andr&eacute; Breton's and Paul Eluard's collaborative work of
surrealist automatism, "The Pre-Natal Life of Man" (an excerpt from
<i>L'Immacul&eacute;e conception</i>).
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 This text is followed by a surrealist "Story" about a dog, a ghost,
 and lepers by the Breton proteg&eacute;e Gis&egrave;le Prassinos. Then
 appear "An Adventure" written by "A Five-Year-Old Boy" and "The Tea
 Party" by "A Seven-Year-Old Girl." Finally, immediately following
 Jennings's "Three Reports" is a screenplay by the surrealist filmmaker
 Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, "The Giraffe." According to the script, this film
 is to consist of a giraffe cut out of wood in life-sized profile,
 with each spot hiding a lid that can be opened onto things visible
 "behind" the spots.

<p>
By comparison, then, to the Mass Observation report of 12 May which has
been quoted above, Jennings's "Three Reports" shares no common reference
with those prose texts surrounding it and thus obviously forms no larger
unit of narrative meaning with them. Yet there is a common feature binding
these various texts of Breton, Bu&ntilde;uel, Prassinos, Jennings, and the
anonymous children: the <i>generic</i> inclusiveness of the surrealist
prose poem. Drawing inspiration from a heterogeneous set of influences,
ranging from precursors such as Rimbaud, Lautr&eacute;amont, and Roussel
to Freudian dream-texts and flea-market kitsch, this genre can embrace
oneiric narrative, found objects, irrational juxtapositions, satirical
mimicry of outmoded books, dysfunctional machines, and distortions of
textual logic introduced through chance and automatic

<b></b>

practices. Jennings himself appears to have understood this generic
consistency&#8212;despite his prose poems' lack of narrative, thematic,
and referential cohesion&#8212;insofar as he projected a larger collection
ironically suggesting "reportage": the August-September 1936 issue of
<i>Contemporary Poetry and Prose</i> carried an advertisement promising
a book by Jennings entitled <i>Popular Narratives</i>, while in another
announcement in the December 1936 issue it bore the projected title
<i>Reports and Photographs</i>. It was to have appeared in spring of
1937 in their special editions series, but the plan was not realized
before the journal folded with the autumn 1937 number.

<p>
Jennings's "reports" are puzzling so long as we are seeking to make
them "reports of" something and do not see that these are "reports" to
be viewed as objects whose referential or functional aspects have been
rendered ambiguous, though not fully effaced. These texts, as Kathleen
Raine pointed out in her preface to Jennings's posthumous collected poems,
can be seen as akin to Marcel Duchamp's appropriation and reinscription
of readymade domestic objects.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 In this light, Jennings's reports appear less like the rapid jottings
 of a witness on the spot than like pages torn out of old books and
 reframed into "poems in prose"&#8212;that literary genre in which
 Duchamp recognized a detouring of poetry akin to his own deflection
 of painting through a "delay in glass."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>


<h3>

<p>
Jennings's "readymade" report-poems found a resonance with two other
poets, Charles Madge, with whom Jennings would help to found the Mass
Observation venture, and the British surrealist poet David Gascoyne
(also involved in Mass Observation). Madge, like Jennings, was a regular
contributor to <i>Contemporary Poetry and Prose</i> and had presided
over the special feature on surrealism in the December 1933 issue of
Geoffrey Grigson's journal <i>New Verse</i>, to which he contributed
a programmatic essay, "Surrealism for the British." Madge argued that
British artists and writers should not merely imitate a Parisian fashion
that was already a decade old by the time it was being discovered in
Britain; rather they should adapt the lessons of surrealism in light of
the national particularities of the English language, literary tradition,
and daily culture.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 One direction in which Madge took this basic orientation was
 anthropological: the observation of the British en masse, to learn about
 the unknown rituals, magical modes of thought, taboos, and wish-images
 which were rooted in the everyday life of this industrial nation. In
 a letter of 30 January, 1937, to <i>The New Statesman and Nation</i>
 entitled "Anthropology at Home," Charles Madge and Humphrey Jennings,
 together with the anthropologist and ornithologist Tom Harrisson,
 set forth their program to understand the British and their peculiar
 collective rites:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Mass Observation develops out of anthropology, psychology, and the
sciences which study man&#8212;but it plans to work with a mass of
observers . . . The following are a few examples of problems that
will arise:
<br />
<blockquote>
Behavior of people at war memorials.
<br />
Shouts and gestures of motorists.

<b></b>
<br />
The aspidistra cult.
<br />
Anthropology of football pools.
<br />
Bathroom behaviour.
<br />
Beards, armpits, eyebrows.
<br />
Anti-semitism.
<br />
Distribution, diffusion and significance of the dirty joke.
<br />
Funerals and undertakers.
<br />
Female taboos about eating.
<br />
The private lives of midwives.
</blockquote>
<br />
In these examples the anthropological angle is obvious, and the
description is primarily of physical behaviour. Other inquiries involve
mental phenomena which are unconscious or repressed, so that they can only
be traced through mass-fantasy and symbolism as developed and exploited,
for example, in the daily press. The outbreak of parturition-images in
the press last October may have been seasonal, or may have been caused
by some public stimulus: continuous watch on the shifting popular images
can only be kept by a multitude of watchers.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Two things are notable about Madge's and Harrisson's list. First is the
almost Swiftian distance from which the British people are surveyed,
training on the domestic front the detached gaze of the anthropologist
on an exotic people. Second, the features that are seen as providing
privileged points of entry into the British collective character are
an incongruous&#8212;indeed, "surreal"&#8212;heap: a kind of categorial
<i>Merzbau</i> assembled out of the detritus of everyday life, newpaper
fads, kitsch, body culture, leisure, and consumerism.

<p>
Like Jennings, Madge also detoured the activity of documentary finding
and reporting through the literary practice of the prose poem. Jennings
had juxtaposed his found fragments of texts, his secondhand "reports,"
in order to estrange the claim to reality of the document and to release
its aura of outmodedness and oneiric meaning. Jennings's adoption of the
"readymade" model moved it distinctly towards the <i>hermeneutic</i>
concerns of surrealism rather than the cool, derisive mechanization of
Duchamp's "pseudo-machines" (as Jennings called them). David Mellor
suggests that Jennings, akin to his exiled German counterpart Walter
Benjamin, was seeking to find in urban, mass media, and commodity culture
the dream- and wish-hieroglyphics of a collective unconscious.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Jennings had translated Andr&eacute; Breton's "Lighthouse of the
 Bride" essay on Duchamp for the 1936 Surrealist Exhibition in
 London, and in his text "The Iron Horse" for the 1938 exhibition
 "The Impact of Machines" he presents Duchamp's work as an artistic
 <i>counterdiscourse</i> to the machine: "The so-called 'abstract'
 painter identifies himself or the person in his picture with a machine
 . . . Not to be confused with abstract painting is the anti-artistic
 creation of pseudo-machines by Duchamp, Picabia, Ernst, Baargeldt,
 Man Ray."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Jennings goes on to juxtapose a note from Duchamp about the <i>Large
 Glass</i> to a letter written by James Watt in 1769 about the Kinneil
 Engine, concluding with a distinction: "The point of creating
 pseudo-machines was not as an exploitation of machinery but as a
 'profanation' of 'Art' parallel to the engineers' 'profanation' of
 the primitive 'sacred places' of the earth."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Yet the artist-engineer, in this view, retains a residual connection
 with the sacred as well&#8212;like a

<b></b>

modern magician presiding over the final descent of magic into
profane life. In contrast, Madge, who in the inaugural pamphlet of Mass
Observation praised Duchamp for having achieved the leap from modernist
to scientist, seemed especially attracted to the estranging quality
of things presented through the affectless voice of the scientist and
technical specialist.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
Compared to Jennings's "Reports," the prose poems included in Madge's
first collection of poems, <i>The Disappearing Castle</i>, appear
more directly to mimic the reports of biologists, social scientists,
geographers and surveyors, and journalists. In some cases, as with the
"Landscape" series, the poems and their titles together seem to represent
labelled "specimens" of prose, found in prospecting within the discursive
spaces of a specialized discipline.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Thus, for example, in "Landscape IV," the landscape evoked is more
 like a depiction in a geology textbook than an actually observed
 geological formation:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Caverns may be divided into three classes. Some have the form of large
clefts or crevices, like veins not filled with ore. Other caverns are
open to the light at both ends. These are rocks really pierced; natural
galleries which run through a solitary mountain. A third form exhibits a
succession of cavities, placed nearly on the same level, running in the
same direction, and communicating with each other by passages of greater
or less breadth. Their almost perfect horizontality, their gentle and
uniform slope, appears to be the result of a long abode of the waters,
which enlarge by erosion clefts already existing. They act in the economy
of nature as vast reservoirs of water, and of elastic fluids.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In other cases, the title operates like a kind of Duchampian pun,
taking the appropriated prose object through the delay of its remapping
onto another referent, order of categories, and hierarchy of values
(for example, Duchamp's inversion of a urinal into the visual-verbal pun
"Fountain"). In Madge's poem "Division of Labour," for example, the title
has theoretical overtones from Karl Marx and &Eacute;mile Durkheim, as
well as connotations of industrialism and technical organization. Yet in
the poem, the technicity exists solely at the level of discursive style,
rather than in the object portrayed:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The Alpine marmots are said to act in concert in the collection of
materials for the construction of their habitations. Some of them, we are
told, cut the herbage, others collect it into heaps; a third set serve
as waggons to carry it to their holes; while a fourth perform all the
functions of draught horse. The manner of the latter part of the curious
process is this. The animal who is to serve as the waggon lies down on
his back, and extending his four limbs as wide as he can, allows himself
to be loaded with hay; and those who are to be the draught horse trail him
thus loaded by the tail, taking care not to overset him. The task of thus
serving as the vehicle, being the least enviable part of the business,
is taken by every one of the party in turn. "I have often," says Mr
Beauplan, in his <i>Description of the Ukraine</i>, "seen them practise
this, and have had the curiosity to watch them at it for days together."

<p>
Juxtaposing the found prose with its suggestive title, Madge sets in
oscillation the apparently opposed poles of nature and technology,
inviting us to see our own industrial organization as a form of
"metabolism with nature." Industrial workers, implicitly, are

<b></b>

reduced by the industrial system to a level in which they become
comparable to industrious rodents; indeed, the organization of the
rodents seems much more "humane" and equitable than the putatively
human form. Their system is strikingly close to the ideal of communism,
a connotation further reinforced by the contrived name of the cited expert
("Mr. Beauplan," or "beautiful plan") and the location of his scientific
fieldwork in the Ukraine.

<p>
Jennings, as I have noted, emphasizes the auratic quality of the outmoded
found text, while Madge draws satirical and critical resources from
the estranged coolness of technical and journalistic language. David
Gascoyne, in turn, seeks to turn the prose poem into a fantastic,
oneiric object itself, abandoning the Duchampian problematic of the
readymade in favor of surrealist expressiveness. The most striking point
at which this distinction can be seen is precisely in Gascoyne's most
explicit attempt to assimilate the lessons of Jennings's "reports," in
the prose poem sequences entitled "Automatic Album Leaves" and "Three
Verbal Objects." In his introduction to his <i>Collected Poems</i>,
Gascoyne notes that "Three Verbal Objects" were:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->. . . first published in the catalogue to an Exhibition
of Surrealist Objects at the London Gallery in the winter of 1937, by
which time I had moved to a Paris attic and virtually ceased writing in
the surrealist vein. They are posthumously dedicated to Humphrey Jennings,
in acknowledgement of the influence that his "Reports" and other admirable
short texts, first published by Roger Roughton in <i>Contemporary Poetry
andProse</i>, undoubtedly had on me.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Gascoyne's sincere appreciation of Jennings's pieces, however, cannot
obscure the enormous difference in the fundamental modes between
Jennings's anachronistic sounding found prose fragments and the visionary
lyricism of Gascoyne's "verbal objects." For Gascoyne, the "objecthood"
of the verbal passage does not mean that the language has been subjected
to a dissolution of its narrative and referential codes, but rather just
the opposite: their rematerialization as an enduring ritual, mythic,
or cosmic entity. Similarly, whereas Jennings's "reports" suggest
the disturbing role of chance in historical life, the contingency and
partiality of our documentary comprehension of events, Gascoyne envisions
an apocalyptic reversal of meanings, symbolically portrayed through images
in which violent destruction is transred into cosmic signs of rebirth:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
From the tower of a quietly blazing mansion whirled a flock of doves,
and the smell of their half-scorched feathers became confused with the
scent of the countless damp and trampled plants that lay a-rotting on
the terraces. And the sky flung a column of wind like a wide-flung scarf
into the distance, where the earth was turning on its never-ending hinge.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast to Jennings's and Madge's use of found prose to fold aspects
of context back into their poetic texts, Gascoyne's prose-poetry, though
skillful and symbolically dense,

<b></b>

lends itself to a fairly conventional exegesis. The burning mansion
suggests a revolutionary attack on the ruling classes, with the
half-scorched doves being images of the beauty that resided in these
luxurious houses, released through a violence that liberates but
scars them. The rotting plants suggest the moribund nature of these
aristocratic houses, the stagnancy and inability of the wealthy to
sustain any genuine life. And on the horizon of change&#8212;the edge
of the turning world&#8212;the sky seems to lift a banner in approval
and to communicate the demand for revolution worldwide.

<p>
The sequence "Automatic Album Leaves" diverges just as greatly from
the "reports" of Jennings and Madge, even though its title suggests
the second-order representation that characterized their use of found
prose. The modifier "automatic" has particular connotations in the
surrealist vocabulary which suggest the very opposite of the usual sense
of mechanical and habitual. For Andr&eacute; Breton, psychic automatism
was intended to express the spontaneity and secret processes of the
unconscious in a fashion as uncensored and directly transcribed as
possible. Thus, in Gascoyne's poem, the title functions as an inventive
catachresis: the free-ranging "automatism" of the unconscious mind
struggling against the confining limits and "cut-out" character of the
"album leaf." The tensions of this poem, in fact, show Gascoyne at
his best; the diminutiveness and delicacy of the form help tame his
propensity towards bathos, while he is able within these tiny frames to
dance playfully across registers of language and rhetorical modes. For
example, in the fifth "leaf," he animates with charming wit the crumbs
left on a plate or table:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
How historic and full of resonance are these crumbs! With their delightful
bell-shaped dresses and their little heads like daggers they are capable
of performing all kinds of aquatic tricks, such as high-life bicycling and
shoe-blacking, and they are able to peer down at leisure into the great
globe that stands in the garden. That they are energetic and truthful I
can only guess, but that their music is sweeter than parsley basins or
mesmeric influences I am certain. Observe the way they glide out of the
churches, lifting their skirts with lobster-like delicacy, watch how
carefully they transform themselves into Japanese plants and begin to
scrub the floor of the travel bureau! Every moment would be disastrous
if they took no precautions against breathing, but happily for us they
have deeply-ingrained sense of gratitude to the human race. They will
never risk thinking in the ordinary, mediocre and <i>sensible</i> way
that people like ourselves do!
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In the next "leaf," however, he inverts this rhetorical procedure of
imputing animate qualities to objects and now gives animate objectivity
to a normally inanimate abstraction. "Suffering," in the sixth "leaf"
becomes a mythic character, like a dragon or sea monster:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Suffering has abundant hair and lives alone on a cliff. The walls of
its house are round and they move up and down like birds' eggs in a
mirage. Bunches of smoke like umbrellas live nearby, with trembling
fingers like glass keys on each of which some date famous in history
has been written. They shake their rattling wrists and Suffering flies
up the chimney and opens its green chemical head like a work-box.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
We might see in Gascoyne's "leaves" a kind of fantastic children's book,
in which the panels have become miraculously animated, like a magic
lantern show. Yet once again this "automatic" character, imparted to
the verbal or pictorial object, would be precisely the opposite of the
readymade automatism of the "reports"&#8212;akin, as Jennings recognized,
to the petrifying and fragmenting snap of the camera shutter. Gascoyne
pushes surrealist lyricism to a magical point of reversal where the limits
of the printed word are overrun and reading takes on a new physicality
and dynamism. He seeks to invest language with a dream-like animation,
so that, as he recounts in "Phenomena," one might say "the words rose
from the places where they had been printed, hovered in the air at a
distance of about six inches from my face and finally, without having
much more than disturbed my impression of their habitual immobility,
dissolved into the growing darkness."

<p>
In concluding my discussion of the British modernist prose poem and its
ties to the documentary aesthetic of the "report," I briefly want to
discuss the animator, illustrator, documentary filmmaker, and poet Len
Lye. Although Lye was not officially a surrealist nor a Mass Observer,
his ties with both groups were substantial. Moreover, he had directly
collaborated with Humphrey Jennings in Grierson's G.P.O. film unit, where
individually both brought an innovative, poetic impulse to the genre of
the documentary: Jennings in films such as <i>Spare Time</i> and <i>A
Diary for Timothy</i>, Lye in <i>Cameramen at War</i> and a number of
short films. In 1936, the two artists, in fact, worked together on an
advertising film for Shell-Mex and British Petroleum, <i>The Birth of the
Robot</i>, with Lye directing and Jennings producing and providing the
color decor. Lye's poetic output, like that of his fellow filmmaker and
painter Jennings, was small but daring. In two successive issues of the
journal <i>Life and Letters Today</i>, in spring and summer of 1938, Lye
published a prose poem sequence entitled "Song-Time Stuff" that offers an
instructive counterpoint to the writings of Jennings, Madge, and Gascoyne.

<p>
Lye's sequence plays off a free-wheeling meditation on visual aesthetics,
thought, and language against two basic discourse forms: the newspaper
article or column and the popular song. The poem is a succession of short
paragraphs, playfully titled in bold face like a headline or song title,
and the texts waver between essay-like statement and avant-garde prose
on the models of Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, and the James
Joyce of <i>Work in Progress</i> (soon to become <i>Finnegans Wake</i>):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
CHAIR IN YOUR HAIR
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Painting painting where is thy mind sting: there there under the chair:
not <i>under</i> the chair says poppa C&eacute;zanne in the legs of
the chair says poppa C&eacute;zanne: that old chair? Chair in you hair
C&eacute;zanne C&eacute;zanne. A chair in the mind is worth none in the
bush. A chair is a chair so leave it there.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The underlying "argument" of this poetic text is a familiar one: Lye's
own particular version of what Ezra Pound called in his imagist writings,
"direct perception of the

<b></b>

thing" or of William Carlos Williams's slogan "No ideas but in
things." Yet what gives Lye's otherwise rather unoriginal aesthetic
meditation its interest is his self-conscious spinning out of these
thoughts on artistic originality within the "readymade" discursive frames
of the newspaper and song.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
Typographically, the sequence strongly resembles those sections of
newspapers in which tidbits of news, society gossip, or letters appear
beneath a caption. In fact, the journal in which Lye's poem appears,
had an editor's "news in brief" section called "News Reel" that also
alluded typographically to this format. Lye, who published regularly in
<i>Life and Letters Today</i> and later became a director in the March
of Time newsreel series, may well have been playing off this journal's
"news" format, which in turn mimics the typical layout of a daily or
weekend paper.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 This allusion to reportage forms, then, suggests that we should see
 "Song-Time Stuff" as a kind of newspaper page or sequence of newsreels
 taking up various topics from the shifting thoughts of the painter as
 he meditates on his art. Here, for example, the "reporter" portrays
 the triviality of outer incident (a sneeze) interrupting the psychic
 eventfulness of dream:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
EFFERVESCENT NIGHT SNEEZE
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
So reality brazens out conclusions for the mind till sleep is the only
eno for thought. The ebb of thought is the flow of self contacting living
reality in one life time. The more impinge the less the flow. ("STS
I," 78)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As with Joyce's playing of newspaper headlines against subjective
stylization in the "Aeolus" episode of <i>Ulysses</i>, however, Lye's
fictive reportage of an argument for the mind's wordless apprehension
of the primordial real generates tensions and ironies.

<p>
At first glance, the irony would seem to be turned, negatively, against
the discourse of journalism. In the section entitled "A HOOK UP FOR THE
HUMAN LINE UP," for example, Lye directly addresses the socially and
culturally levelling effects of the newspaper:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Take newspaper the far-flung human what's-on: a precise analogy with
another index. After the average truth hook up some sort of general line
up. Not until the last line up will average mind inherit mind as its own
best footprint. Take it now take newspaper take man about uniforms about
station italian delegation man about town or philosophers' hilltop or
pub and bets in the park: within some four walls each has his gall. Take
inquisition lore was evermore man about sex about witches or national
sploor. But now the poor are excited to read: horses and new flesh:
reading is good for the poor. Daily doings reflect personal flesh: flesh
fascinates flesh according to glow with entrail revulsion fascination
fascisti bathroom altar sacrificisation body beautiful personal heartthrob
commune problem relation international. When entrails are spilt the news
fascination arrays them right in the readers lap.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Not unlike Joyce, Lye is presenting a kind of excremental flow of events,
predigested and blended into mental waste by the newspaper. He punningly
apposes the fascination of the newspaper reader with sex and violence
to the more literal, scatological and coprophagic connotations of such
phrases as "Daily doings reflect personal flesh,"

<b></b>

"When entrails are spilt," and "the reader's lap." Lye's newspaper is
taken into the toilet, kept on the lap during the "daily doings," and
disposed of properly: "I'll leave it."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
Yet this rather straightforward satire is complicated by the very
quality that the newspaper embodies and that seems to draw Lye's fire,
its ephemerality and the mobility of its reference. For Lye also admits
that he values precisely change and time. It is, then, to the song-form
that Lye turns, with its ability to adjust itself to and artistically
register the flow of time without being constrained to naturalistic
reportage. Song&#8212;here signified by the fragmentation of words and
syntax into rhythmic sound-patterns&#8212;represents for Lye a form
of thought that is concrete, non-conceptual, yet fundamentally attuned
to time and change. In Lye's sequence, song is given the outer form of
the newspaper article but disrupts it from within. Reportage is delayed
through the web of sound associations and puns, deflected from its mimetic
correspondence to the mundane, and detoured out of the documentation of
"daily doings" onto the pathways of mind and thought.

<p>
This deformative forming of referential language through song turns
reportage into the material hum of time, a "song-time-stuff" as a
de-differentiated medium that is not verse poetry nor music nor painting
nor reportage. Only within this new prose-song medium, Lye suggests,
can any genuine report of the mind be given. But it will not resemble the
language of journalism or even of the more subversive reportage of Mass
Observation and its concern with the rituals and customs of that foreign
folk, the British. It will be a new modernist-documentary hybrid, that
"other report" that Jennings, Madge, and Gascoyne in their own idiom and
in their own approach to the prose poem also sought to deliver&#8212;a
report of the mind in its workings, or at least, as the title of one
of Lye's sections indicates, "AN O. K. ECHO" of its complexities and
perplexities ("STS I," 80).

The Charles Madge papers at the Mass Observation Archive, University
of Sussex, contain a suggestive montage of newspaper articles entitled
"In Honour of La Fontaine" (Charles Madge Papers, 19 / 3). A typed note
points out that "the following observations on the human animal are all
taken from the <i>Observer</i> of 5 August, 1934." The eight clippings
pasted to the two sheets include texts on Hitler, the police in Madrid,
a diplomatic warning by Japan to the Soviet Union, British motor travel,
stinging jellyfish, the importation of cats to combat a plague of mice
in Italy, an attack by storks on vultures in Turkey, and the breeding
habits of land crabs. Although this montage corresponds to no published
prose poem text, and I have not been able to locate source material for
the published report-poems, it is plausible to speculate that "In Honour
of La Fontaine" represents a stage of a projected prose poem in which
the newspaper material was meant to be cited or mimicked and recombined
into a surrealistic melange of natural and historical faces of the
"political animal." I am grateful to Dorothy Sheridan and the staff of
the Mass Observation Archive for making these papers available to me.

One of the twentieth century's most contentious aesthetic controversies
was laid to rest, at least according to contemporary news reports, at
the Metropolitan Museum late in 1936 when Erwin Panofsky lectured on
the topic "The Motion Picture as an Art."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Though the enthusiasm of the New York papers, stirred by this plebeian
 invasion of the precincts of the Met, may have been a bit misplaced,
 Panofsky's lecture is still considered important in establishing serious
 academic study of the movies. A revised version of the lecture, entitled
 "Style and Medium in the Moving Pictures," has been reprinted dozens
 of times, in so many different contexts that it has been called not
 just Panofsky's most popular work but "perhaps the most popular essay
 in modern art history."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 In fact, the essay has been so frequently reprinted that it has lost
 contact not just with its original state as a lecture at the Met but
 also with its first publication, which took place, as it happens, in
 transition, the avant-garde literary magazine edited by Eugene Jolas,
 where the lecture appeared alongside an installment of Joyce's then
 untitled Work in Progress, the first English translation of Kafka's
 Metamorphosis, James Agee's "In Memory of My Father," and illustrations
 by Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Fernand L&eacute;ger, Wassili Kandinsky,
 L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, Piet Mondrian, Henry Moore, and
 Alexander Calder.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
Restoring this groundbreaking essay to its original published context
creates a concatenation at least as interesting as the one that provoked
the New York papers in 1936. For it suggests not just that international
modernism of the kind exemplified by <i>transition</i> might have had
some interest in the movies, in its

<b></b>

own way as unexpected as the idea that the Met might have had such an
interest, but also that the modernist avant-garde might have played a
role in erasing the distinction between this mass medium and advanced art.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Establishing such a relationship, however, inevitably raises a related
 question. If literary modernism, at least in regard to this journal,
 played a significant role in legitimizing the movies as an accepted art
 form, does this suggest that movies played any reciprocal role in the
 aesthetic transformation of modern literature and art? In particular,
 what role might the movies have played in the aesthetic project most
 commonly associated with <i>transition</i>, which was published under
 the banner of "the Revolution of the Word"?
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Would it be possible to apply much more broadly an invented term
 that Jolas applied to one of his own poems, "Logocin&eacute;ma of
 the Frontierman"?
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 In what sense might <i>transition</i> itself, and perhaps even
 the general modernist project behind it, be considered a kind of
 "logocinema," a revolution of the word accomplished quite literally
 by bringing to language the physical dynamism and energy associated
 with film?

<p>
In fact, the publication life of <i>transition</i>, which appeared
regularly from 1927 to 1932 and then sporadically until 1938, coincided
with a dramatic peak in the intellectual prestige of the movies. As
Natasha Staller has shown, film had been a popular diversion and an
aesthetic influence in the French avant-garde from as early as 1904,
and Vachel Lindsay had begun his American campaign on behalf of the
movies in 1915, but what had been something of a lonely effort at that
time quickly became almost a commonplace of the avant-garde in the 1920s.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Film magazines such as <i>Close Up</i>, which advertised itself in
 the September 1927 issue of <i>transition</i> as "The first review to
 approach films from the angles of art, experiment and possibility,"
 appeared all over Europe between 1921, when <i>Cin&eacute;a</i>
 appeared in France, and 1930, when <i>Film Art</i> began publication in
 England. Film societies were founded in most European capitals&#8212;in
 Paris in 1920, in London in 1925, in Amsterdam in 1927&#8212;and
 theaters showing classic and experimental films were established in
 many large cities, including several in the U.S.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Though it may be a little hard to discern any serious reason why Picasso
and Braque might have attended <i>La Petite Fifi</i> in 1913, significant
aesthetic issues were in fact raised by these early films quite apart
from subject matter and film technique.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Before the arrival of sound, watching a movie also required a good deal
 of reading, as inter-titles alternated with filmed action. Sometimes,
 film-makers such as M&eacute;li&egrave;s purposely violated the
 boundaries between the two by making signs or alphanumeric res
 into fanciful characters in the film, but even when nothing so overt
 was done, film constantly placed written language in a new, dynamic
 relation to visual images.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 As P. Adams Sitney insisted some years ago, this "interaction of
 photographic realism with the language of intertitles was to produce in
 artists, and particularly in writers, fascinating and complex attitudes
 toward the cinema."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 In its turn, however, this complex reaction to film fundamentally
 affected modern conceptions of the eternally variable relationship
 between words and images.

<p>
On the one hand, silent film seemed to demonstrate far more thoroughly
than still pictures the narrative power of visual imagery. Thus it was
quite common at this time

<b></b>

to insist that movies depend on a visual lexicon distinct from and in
many ways superior to written language. Boris Eikenbaum's theory of
inner speech, offered in 1927, is just the most substantial and serious
example of an idea offered in a dozen different forms in these years,
one that led to a widespread antagonism toward inter-titles, which were
thought to interfere with the development of a properly visual film art.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 On the other hand, inter-titles seemed to demonstrate anew the forgotten
 visual qualities of writing, which, in its progress across the silent
 movie screen, could become a moving image itself.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Thus Marcel Duchamp produced "films" like <i>An&eacute;mic
 Cin&eacute;ma</i> almost entirely composed of inter-titles, in which
 verbal expressions printed on revolving discs move in exactly the same
 spirals as the graphic images they interrupt. Though there is a great
 deal of purely verbal humor in this film, it nonetheless erases the
 static distinction between filmed images and printed inter-titles,
 and in so doing restores to language a graphic, even a visceral,
 dimension it generally loses as a conveyor of meaning.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
By showing how images might be codified and arranged as if they were
semiotic elements, and by revealing the extent to which written language
is a visual artifact, silent film helped the avant-garde to achieve its
fruitful disruptions of this time-honored opposition, disruptions that,
beginning with the calligrammes of Apollinaire and ending with Duchamp's
<i>Large Glass</i>, seem synonymous with the avant-garde itself.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 For this reason, 1927, the year in which <i>transition</i> began
 publication, represents a crisis in the relation of the avant-garde
 to film, for this is the year in which the inter-titles began
 to disappear. The arrival of sound, which was actually an uneven
 and protracted process that dragged out over several years, has,
 according to David Bordwell, a kind of mythic importance in histories
 of avant-garde film, abruptly halting the development of this new
 visual art form.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 It is certainly the case that sound was resisted by most artists and
 writers who cared about movies.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Generally speaking, this resistance based itself on the belief that
 sound violates the visual autonomy of film, which is, as Antonin Artaud
 declared in <i>transition</i>, "an inorganic language which works on
 our minds by an osmosis and demands no translation into words."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 But it is also possible that just the opposite is true, that the arrival
 of sound removed a basic semiotic tension from film, introducing along
 with spoken dialogue an apparent unity of speech and vision, and that
 the controversies attending it may have as much to do with this loss
 as they do with the technical and dramatic changes that followed.

<p>
In any case, the most active years in the publication life of
<i>transition</i>, 1927-1933, coincided with an extended crisis in the
avant-garde's relation to film. During these years, <i>transition</i>
itself becomes a kind of "logocinema," a hybrid object, not only
multi-lingual but visual as well as verbal. Always an illustrated journal,
<i>transition</i> was, Jolas proudly claimed in 1930, "the first of the
Anglo-Saxon reviews to introduce the art of creative photography."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Though it is difficult to credit such a claim, given the obvious
 precedence ofso many publications, <i>Camera Work</i> not the least
 among them, <i>transition</i> did insist from the very beginning on
 a strong association between photography and the other arts. In 1927,
 Jean George Auriol insisted "for us a photograph is as good as a poem,"
 and Jolas himself emphasized "the importance of cinema in modern art
 and literature" in the same issue.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Beginning with its third issue, <i>transition</i> enjoyed an

<b></b>

especially close relationship with Man Ray, whose experimental films
<i>Emak Bakia</i> and <i>L'&Eacute;toile de Mer</i> are featured in
September, 1927, January, 1928, Summer, 1928, and February, 1929,
and whose photographs and photograms appeared in a number of other
issues. There were multiple appearances as well by L&aacute;szl&oacute;
Moholy-Nagy and Francis Bruguiere and single works by photographers
from Matthew Brady to Tina Modotti, with articles or film stills from
directors such as Eisenstein and Chaplin.

<p>
The original impetus for this involvement must have come from Jolas
himself, whose early poetry provides an instructive example of the shift
of word into moving image, for his first book of poems was entitled
<i>Ink</i> and his second <i>Cinema</i>. The poems in <i>Ink</i> clearly
stem from Jolas' experiences as a newspaper reporter, which he tried to
get into the very materials of the poetry: "I thought in terms of machine
words and tried to make the newspaper rhythm the basis of my inspiration."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 But even poems with titles like "Linotype" seem to look forward to
 another medium. In this poem, the endless, associative unrolling of
 one episode into another is meant to mimic the river of newsprint
 emerging from the linotype machine, but it also begins to suggest the
 more continuously fluid form of the movies: "dynamically the film of
 the world rolls along."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 This tendency for ink to become cinema, for "machine words" to become
 moving images, seems to have been part of Jolas' aesthetic from the very
 beginning. In his autobiography he recounts his rediscovery of English
 as a "new vocabulary" useful "for living in a <i>camera obscura</i>
 world of my own invention."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 This notion, that a new language provides a distanced perspective
 on reality much like that offered by the camera, and vice versa,
 is perhaps the kernel from which the whole "logocinema" begins.

<p>
In his years as editor of <i>transition</i>, Jolas wrote a number
of poems, including "Transcendental Feature Film" from August, 1927,
that further illustrate this tendency for ink to emulate cinema. On the
other hand, however, he frequently used his editorial appearances to
campaign against what he called "the photography of events" or "verbal
photography."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 In the June 1936 issue, an issue that included three film stills in
 a new section devoted entirely to the cinema, Jolas committed his
 journal forthrightly against "the photographic" in literature.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 What may seem a fairly basic contradiction, or at least a serious
 tension, is resolved by the simple fact that for Jolas photography
 was not particularly photographic. As Ren&eacute; Crevel once put it,
 in a little aphorism quoted by Salvador Dal&iacute;, "painting is
 not photography, the painters say. But photography is not photography
 either."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 That is to say, in a journal as seriously under the influence of
 Surrealism as <i>transition</i>, photography is not the most mimetic
 of all art forms but rather the one most intimately acquainted with
 the unconscious. In a single essay, therefore, Jolas can denounce
 "the photographic representation of life" and also declare that cinema
 "can give us possibilities for hallucination that check successfully
 the pedantry of the puritan."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
When <i>transition</i> celebrates photography, then, it celebrates an
art form that, at least in principle, enjoys special access to what
Jolas called "the subconscious world."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 The very automatism that, in some accounts, makes photography the most
 truly mimetic of all the arts, frees the camera eye from conventional
 patterns of human perception, removing, as Man Ray puts it, "inculcated
 modes of presentation, resulting in

<b></b>

apparent artificiality or strangeness."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 For the writers and artists who published in <i>transition</i>
 in these years, photography is most properly an art of the unseen,
 "the enigmatic and the marvellous," as Jolas proclaimed in 1929.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Simply by capturing with machinic perfection every ray of light
 available to the lens, the camera makes it disconcertingly clear
 how much ordinary eyesight depends on involuntary and unconscious
 filters. As Stuart Gilbert put it in a 1937 issue of <i>transition</i>,
 "the art of living is largely an art of elimination and selection;
 we are constantly narrowing down, sometimes deliberately, sometimes
 automatically, the field of our attention, in order to cope with the
 exigencies of daily life."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 The role of photography, therefore, is to restore to consciousness all
 that is filtered out and in so doing to disrupt the invisible routines
 of perception; as Man Ray says "to inflict cruel contradictions on
 the adorers of familiar visions."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps the most complete development of this argument was contributed
by Louis Aragon to a public debate sponsored by the Association of
Revolutionary Writers and Artists in 1936, selections of which were
published in <i>transition</i> in the fall of that year. Aragon argues
that the full potential of the camera as a creative tool was only
realized when movies began to influence the snapshot: "The cinema seizes
millions of fleeting, impermanent aspects of the world around us. It
has taught us more about man in a few years than centuries of painting
have taught: fugitive expressions, attitudes scarcely credible yet real,
charm and hideousness. What revelations concerning our own movements,
for example, do we not owe to the slow-motion picture? What did we
understand of human exertion before the slow-motion picture, what of the
expressions resultant from abominable suffering?" According to Aragon,
technical advances brought to still cameras from the movies and aesthetic
influences from film technique transformed photography in the 1920s,
making it into an entirely new art of physical and psychic revelation:
"it has gone everywhere taking life by surprise: and once again it has
become more revealing and more denunciatory than painting . . . It
arrests moments . . . that no one would have ventured to imagine or
presumed to see." In short, "the photograph teaches us to see&#8212;it
sees what the eye fails to discern."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
The revelation Aragon attributes to the camera, that eyesight itself is
not faithfully mimetic, that it must actively suppress a great deal of
what might otherwise be seen, was widely felt and widely influential at
this time. Probably the most familiar version of this idea to contemporary
criticism is that of Walter Benjamin, who gave the name "optical
unconscious" to the region of sight that "the eye fails to discern."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 The suggestion embedded in Benjamin's term that ordinary eyesight is
 produced and maintained by some kind of psychic effort had aesthetic
 implications far beyond photography itself. Most radically, it tended
 to collapse the distinction between seeing and representation, as James
 Johnson Sweeney suggested in an article, published in <i>transition</i>
 in 1936. For Sweeney, the fact that "we are forced to make our visual
 approach to the world about us selectively" means that seeing is
 itself a process of representation. Going back to Berkeley for support,
 Sweeney maintains that "visible ideas" are but "arbitrary signs" or even
 "ideographs, of which the interpretation cannot escape the subjective."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 For Sweeney's purposes, the most significant implication of this fact

<b></b>

is that it tends to erase the apparent distinction between abstract and
representational art, which become in his analysis nothing more than
two different systems of arbitrary signs. Implied, but not insisted on,
in Sweeney's analysis is the far more radical reduction of the difference
between the visual arts and writing. If, as Sweeney insists, vision itself
is linguistic, as a process of representation based on arbitrary signs,
then writing and visual art confront one another like two different
languages, or perhaps two different methods of inscription.

<p>
This is precisely how photography and film were treated in
<i>transition</i>, as modern methods of inscription, rivals to
writing as much as they were rivals to the arts of the past. Just as
<i>transition</i> purposely juxtaposed French, German, and English, and
drew from this conflict entirely new, synthetic words, it used photography
as a lever against all written language, hoping to draw from this conflict
a renovation so basic it would be alphabetic. In 1927, Jolas demanded:
"We need new words, new abstractions, new hieroglyphics, new symbols,
new myths"; a few years later he put it down as "new symbols and sigils,
new hieroglyphs to express what to many seems the inexpressible."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 What he wanted in short was a new script, or, better yet, an entirely
 new form of representation, one conditioned by the development of
 new media: "The mutation now going on, which is helped dynamically by
 the new technological means such as the cinema, the radio, and other
 mechanical forces, is about to create a linguistic interpenetration
 that will doubtless have its effect on the final morphological process
 of modern languages."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 What Jolas means here is that the new media, simply as vastly powerful
 methods of communication, facilitate the interpenetration of national
 languages, but also that as languages themselves the new media merge
 with the existing national languages to create entirely new forms:
 "The writer has new forms at his disposal, a fusion of forms in
 which all the senses come into their own . . . The development of the
 talking film and radio will doubtless have a revolutionary effect on
 the drama, among other things. And since sound seems to be the basis
 of the hear-play and the cinema-drama, it is safe to say that the
 problem of the new form will be the word."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Trilingual himself, a native of Alsace-Lorraine and New Jersey,
 Jolas saw "the Revolution of the Word" as one result of the clash and
 combination of languages resulting from the vastly increased scope of
 modern migration. Even more basic, however, than the clash of languages
 was the clash of scripts, of representational forms, resulting from the
 development of the new media, not just because the letter is more basic
 than the word, but also because the clash of scripts makes everyday
 life in any modern country constantly translational, as writing meets
 recordings, pictures, and films.

<p>
Among the polylingual forms published in <i>transition</i> were written
works reflecting the influence of photography or film, works such as
Henri Poulaille's "Mad Train," which, according to Jolas, "uses the
dynamics of the screen."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Jolas announced in 1928 that <i>transition</i> would be trying to
 encourage "the form of the scenario," rather than the short story or
 the novel, "because it seems a most elastic combination of all the
 various forms."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 He had already published Elliot Paul's scenario "The Ninety and Nine,"
 which attempts to tell its story entirely through shots of disembodied
 hands, and he was in subsequent issues to include scenarios by Robert
 Desnos, John Herrman,

<b></b>

Antonin Artaud, Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, Philippe Soupault, and
himself, under the nom de plume of Theo Rutra. In a 1936 issue, Jolas
reprinted from Hugo Ball's "Dada Diary" a fragment declaring "the word
and the image are one. Painting and composing poetry belong together" that
might have seemed a motto at this point for the journal itself. The issue
also included work from five photographers, contributions to the debate on
painting and reality by Aragon, Le Corbusier, and Fernand L&eacute;ger,
and ten pages of stills from Paul Strand's movie <i>Redes</i>, shot
in Mexico.

<p>
Some of the best examples of both the possibilities and the limitations
of this effort are to be found in the poetry copiously contributed by
Jolas himself.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 Not only is this poetry generally trilingual, but it is also full of
 verbal promises of a visual text, "flamewriting," as he called it in
 one poem. "Soon the logotype will lightshriek bingbangbing letters in
 scarlet," he proclaims in a poem published in 1933.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 Of course, the very fervor with which the poet proclaims these coming
 transformations, especially since it is combined with no sort of
 typographical experiment, for <i>transition</i> was printed throughout
 its life in a conventional letterpress, raises the question as to
 whether or not poetry can ever do any more than merely promise the sort
 of dynamic logocinema that Jolas has in mind. It is clear that Jolas
 thought of these poems, perhaps even of the whole semantic revolution,
 as depending on a "<i>montage in words</i>" ("WS," 103) frankly based
 on cinematic models. Of "one or two modern film creators" he admired,
 Jolas once observed, "through mechanical means they flash before our
 eyes a series of rhythmitized images which produces illuminations
 without slavish reference points in our sensual lives . . . Poetry,
 using the word as mechanics, may, like the film, produce a metaphoric
 universe which is a sublimation of the physical world."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 The synesthetic portmanteau words on which Jolas' mature poetry depends
 so heavily are certainly indebted to <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, but they
 are also attempts to produce a verbal montage that would mimic the
 juxtapositional syntax of modern film editing. Using words as if they
 were frames of film was perhaps as close as Jolas could get to turning
 poetry into a cinematic art form.

<p>
For this reason, Jolas is frequently forced merely to evoke a cinematic
situation, as at the end of a poem called "Choirprair": "We stand
listening to village-rounds, paradise-animals, gleam and glast of
flickerhymns."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 The gleaming flicker hymns in this poem seem synesthetic movies, but
 since they obviously cannot be seen in this medium, Jolas dramatizes
 the act of watching and listening to them. There is quite a bit of
 this sort of dramatization in Jolas' poetry in <i>transition</i>,
 perhaps the most revealing example of which occurs in number thirteen:
 "transatlantic testament rises towards me from the electric sign-board."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 The poem describes and also hopes to mimic words that are cinematized
 by their movement across the electric sign, which movement also makes
 them transatlantic or multilingual. But what is also important about
 this and other examples of dramatized spectatorship in Jolas' poetry
 is its public character. The electric sign, like the flicker hymns of
 "Choirprair," is perceived outdoors in a collective situation, like
 a movie or an advertisement, unlike the actual poem itself, which is
 read in silence by the solitary subscriber of <i>transition</i>. The
 setting is important because it illustrates one additional way in
 which the new media served as examples for

<b></b>

Jolas' revolutionary project. The new script he imagined would fuse
all known languages together in an "intercontinental synthesis"
and "thus become the truly universal language" ("WS," 98). But its
universality would rely on more than linguistic synthesis. By jumping
the gap between the verbal and the visual, the new language would reach
its audience collectively, as movies and radio do, and thus "bind the
races in a fabulous unity" ("WS," 104). In other words, Jolas imagined
the revolutionized word as a mass medium, "an inter-racial language. . . to express the collective inner vision of mankind" ("WS," 104).

<p>
Overcoming the difference between writing and the visual carries in
this context much the same significance as translating between national
languages. Thus Syd Salt proposes in 1928 that the slogan most associated
with <i>transition</i>, "internationalism in the arts," be exchanged
for one he feels is even broader: "The breaking down of all snobbish
barriers between all arts."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 For many artists and writers at this time, however, photography was
 not so much one of the arts to be integrated with the others as it was
 already the medium within which they had been combined. As a visual
 language, photography seemed to Moholy-Nagy "universally valid."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 Jolas speaks in a 1929 issue of the "supra-earthly imagination"
 expressed by the camera. The "twentieth century word" he celebrates
 in this essay is dynamic, technological, and "suprematic," a language
 created largely out of the new media of the century and therefore
 fit for "the future intercontinental man" ("SO," 14). At this point,
 however, it should be clear that the significance of photography has
 undergone a dramatic shift. What had been considered a particular
 language, valuable precisely because of its disconcerting difference
 from conventional languages, has somehow become universal. The
 particular virtue of this language had formerly been its obliquity,
 its disorienting unfamiliarity, but in these latter passages it seems to
 have become utterly transparent. Photography becomes one of the gesture
 languages Robert McAlmon celebrates in a 1929 article, "an esperanto
 of the subconscious," that makes the underside of conventional daily
 life as ordinary as sunshine.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

<p>
It is little wonder, then, that <i>transition</i> began including special
sections on "Cinema" and on something called "Inter-racial Documents"
at about the same time. Though there were no overt connections drawn
between the frame from <i>Steamboat Willie</i> that appeared in June,
1936, and the Eskimo dance mask in the same issue, it is clear that both
were to be seen as "inter-racial documents," instances of universal form
languages, tokens of the "super-language" that Jolas foresaw emerging
from the "inter-racial synthesis now going on" in North America.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
 "Primitive myths and the modern mythos are fused," as he put it in 1929.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 Both film stills and Eskimo masks are inserted into <i>transition</i>
 without commentary, as if they were equally self-explanatory,
 though the Eskimo dance mask is faced disconcertingly by an article
 on the Fox Indians of Iowa. The very oddity of these juxtapositions
 reveals something, however, about the ambiguous role of the visual in
 <i>transition</i>. On one hand, visual imagery provides a fundamental
 tension within the general category of the linguistic. On the other
 hand, however, pictures are universal, and the difference they
 incorporate into the situation of writing exists only to disappear,
 as the difference represented by the Eskimo mask dissolves

<b></b>

into the difference represented by the Fox Indians of Iowa and then into
an "inter-racial and inter-continental synthesis" so massive nothing can
be foreign to it. One of the reasons <i>transition</i> is itself such an
intriguing document, that it is so revealing an example of the tensions
within aesthetic modernism, is that its editors and contributors are
never forced to decide between these alternatives: photography stands
for everything common sense leaves out and at the same time for a kind
of sense so common it leaves nothing out.

<p>
For Jolas, this contradiction was rather frequently resolved by a very
particular kind of cinematography, by writing that actually moved and in
so doing became universally readable and revolutionary at once. Type made
out of light, especially moving light, appears in many of the visionary
poems Jolas published in <i>transition</i>. In "Walk through Cosmopolis,"
for example, which appeared in 1928, "the sky was garlanded with obscure
designs that brought the sting of a desire." These designs, it seems,
are on the most literal level neon signs, electrified marquees, and
lighted billboards, and they appear to Jolas like gigantic nighttime
movies made out of type: "The revolution of my senses blazed across
your towers . . . There I watched you in the vertigo that made me see
the distorted films of my vision."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 Often in Jolas' poetry, these signs seem themselves to have accomplished
 a revolution of the word, simply by lighting it up and putting it in
 motion: "You brought me the gift of the new century, divine affirmer,
 sirocco of electricity, pulsing of radio, express train, cinema,
 television! . . . Immensely the world lies before me, x-rayed in every
 fibre of its cosmic magic. I am no longer alone, for the electric signs
 paint the nocturnal screens of my visions, and the wireless strangles
 time and space."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 The ability to project language across time and space, to make it
 available for collective consumption, makes electric signs and the
 wireless harbingers for Jolas of entirely new forms of literature
 that would somehow turn the private vision into a public spectacle and
 thus bridge the gap of incomprehension that usually divides different
 languages and different individuals.

<p>
Lit up and put in motion in this way, type acquires the essential
formal characteristics of the movies, at least as they were identified
in <i>transition</i>. According to Panofsky, "the primordial basis of
the enjoyment of moving pictures was . . . sheer delight in the fact
that things seemed to <i>move</i> no matter what things they were."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 Movement itself, especially when added to otherwise stationary
 objects, formed for Panofsky the essence of film as an art, because
 that movement constituted the almost folkloric appeal of film to
 its audience. Thus Panofsky explains the connection between the most
 advanced recording technology and the widest possible popular audience,
 for this delight in movement is in his view so basic a human quality as
 to be universal. Other writers for <i>transition</i> also insisted that
 "mobility" is the essence of film art, and several demanded a literature
 that would mimic that movement: "It has to come, if our art is to have
 any relation to this rhythmic, moving cinematographic age of ours."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 Or, as Jolas put it, "we need the twentieth century word. We need the
 word of movement, the word expressive of the great new forces around us"
 ("SO," 15). Words need to move, to become a literal cinematography,
 because only in this way can they cut against old, accepted literary
 usages and also reach a wide popular audience.

<b></b>

<p>
Jolas' demand for "the word of movement" was answered most literally by
an essay that appeared in <i>transition</i> for June, 1930, along with
scenarios by Artaud, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Soupault, and Jolas himself,
writing as Theo Rutra, and an essay on "The Cinematographic Principle
and Japanese Culture" by Eisenstein. The essay, entitled "The Readies,"
announced a new project by one of the American avant-garde's most elusive
expatriates, Bob Brown.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
 For a good part of his life, Brown was little more than a hack writer,
 turning out jingles, advertisements, news stories, and popular novels,
 one of which, <i>What Happened to Mary</i>, was perhaps the very
 first film novelization, adapted from the very first movie serial,
 issued by Edison in 1912.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 In the latter part of his life, Brown turned to cookbooks like
 <i>The Complete Book of Cheese</i> or <i>Let There Be Beer</i>. In
 between these two stints in the netherworld of popular journalism,
 Brown became one of the more intriguing of the eccentric writers
 filling out the edges of the transatlantic avant-garde. As early as
 1914, he met Marcel Duchamp and contributed a hand-drawn poem called
 "Eyes" to Duchamp's New York magazine <i>The Blind Man</i>. After
 the war, Brown, like so many other American writers, found himself in
 France, where he fit quite naturally into the expatriate group around
 <i>transition</i>. Like Jolas, he thought of constant travel, exposure
 to new languages and customs, as an essential aesthetic influence on
 his work, an influence signified by the title of his best known book
 of conventional poems, <i>Globe-Gliding</i>, which was republished in
 the U.S. in 1931 as <i>Nomadness</i>.

<p>
If Brown is worth remembering, however, it is not because of the poems
printed in <i>Globe-Gliding</i> or anywhere else, but rather for his
attempt to do away with printed poems altogether. One of the original
contributors to <i>transition</i>'s "Revolution of the Word," Brown
attempted to take that campaign in a direction in which <i>transition</i>,
as a mere letterpress publication, could not follow. Brown imagined
what was for him a natural convergence of new media and modern writing,
influenced equally by "the moving electric news and advertising signs
on top of great newspaper buildings," "the possibilities of the movies,"
the writing of Gertrude Stein, and the calligrammes of Apollinaire.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 One of the most significant aspects of Brown's writing on behalf of
 "the Revolution of the Word" is this almost automatic assumption
 that new technological developments in the media should converge with
 experimental writing like that of Stein and Joyce, but for Brown this
 convergence had not progressed far enough, not even in the typographical
 experiments of Apollinaire. Changing type size or position amounts
 to very little in comparison to Brown's desire that the type actually
 move. Giving words their freedom, to adapt Marinetti's famous slogan,
 could only be accomplished by putting "type in motion" ("A," 153).

<p>
There is so much sheer boosterism in Brown's writing, and so much
repetition, that it is easy to miss what is in fact its essential insight,
for Brown realized that printing itself had already been changed by the
new media: "we have advanced from Gutenberg's movable type through the
linotype and monotype to photo-composing."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
 In other words, many of the pages still being read as if they were
 traditional print were in fact photographs, a fact only obscured
 by an outmoded tendency to think of word and image in oppositional
 terms. Many of Apollinaire's calligrammes and virtually all of

<b></b>

Marinetti's <i>parole in libert&agrave;</i> are actually photographs
partially composed of words, since the extreme distortions visited on
text in these works are unthinkable without the techniques of photo
reproduction.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
 Virtually alone at this time, Brown recognized the implications of
 this change, for it meant that in technological terms a significant
 "Revolution of the Word" had already been accomplished by the very
 machine in which Jolas had invested so many of his hopes for the
 future. Recognizing this, Brown also realized that far most drastic
 distortions could be accomplished than those already achieved by
 Apollinaire and Marinetti: "By photographic composition, which is
 rapidly taking the place of antiquated methods, type since 1925 has
 been turned out which is not readable without the aid of a magnifying
 glass" (<i>TR</i>, 32). If type could be manipulated photographically
 in this way, then, Brown reasoned, it could also follow photography
 in its development into movies. Hence the readies.

<p>
As Brown put it in one of several self-advertisements published around
1930: "modern word-conveyers are needed now, reading will have to be
done by machine; microscopic type on a moveable tape running beneath a
slot equipped with a magnifying glass and brought up to life size before
the reader's birdlike eye" (<i>TR</i>, 13). At least one such machine
was actually constructed; from the photograph included in the anthology
<i>Readies for Bob Brown's Machine</i> it appears to have anticipated the
microfilm reader. The promotional rhetoric that Brown supplied, however,
anticipates with uncanny prescience current hoopla around the e-book: "To
continue reading at today's speed I must have a machine . . . A machine
as handy as a portable phonograph, typewriter or radio, compact, minute,
operated by electricity" (<i>TR</i>, 28). The chief difference, however,
is that Brown's electronic book would not try to mimic the conventional
page, but would actually make the type move: "they move in on me, unroll
before my mental eyes, just the same as the endless flow of words ebb and
flow on my inner eye-ball" ("A," 157-58). Thus the readies, which Brown
imagined as a new genre, a sort of modernist movie constructed of type:
"The word 'readies' suggests to me a moving-type spectacle, reading at
the speed-rate of the present day with the aid of a machine, a method
of enjoying literature in a manner as up to date as the lively talkies"
("A," 176-77).

<p>
Brown called for "a literary renaissance through the Readie" ("A," 186),
and he did succeed in filling one anthology of contributions, many of them
from well-known modern writers. Most of these, including Stein, Pound,
and Williams, sent previously published works or squibs like Williams'
"Readie Pome," which didn't even pretend to take the new invention very
seriously. But a few prominent writers, including James T. Farrell and
Kay Boyle, "translated" earlier works for the readie machine, and at
least a few of these seemed to be carried along by Brown's faith that
his was the most promising front in "the Revolution of the Word." In
his analysis, making the type move somehow transformed letters into
pictographs and made reading into a visual activity as immediate and
direct as watching a film. He called it "a new kind of writing direct
to the mind through the eye" ("A," 161), a definition echoed in some
of the Readies themselves, including one contributed by George Kent:
"perhaps the reading machine . . . will be the maxim silencer of words. . . thoughts will go right into the head . . . heart

<b></b>
. . . stomach . . . depending upon the aim . . . without a sound"
(<i>TR</i>, 75). Giving words this kind of immediate relation to
consciousness also meant, of course, transcending the cultural limitations
that hinder particular languages. Inevitably, the readies were said to
"approach closer the hieroglyphic mysteries" ("A," 168) and in so doing to
become a universal method of communication: "conventional word-prejudices
will be automatically overcome" (<i>TR</i>, 39).

<p>
Phrased in such a bald and obvious way, Brown's claim seems painfully
na&iuml;ve, and yet it is simply an extreme formulation of an ambition
that had held great sway over European society since the days of
the earliest photographs and which had come to be a common motive of
modern artists and writers. The very extremity of Brown's claims and the
eccentricity of his machine are valuable in exposing certain inevitable
blind spots in the machine vision of transatlantic modernism. To begin
with, Brown has astonishing faith in the effect of speed to overcome
the conventional nature of alphabetic text. He seems to ignore the
fact that the machines he envies, and on which he intends to model his
reading machine, were based on new technologies of recording, not just of
presentation. Despite Norman Macleod's stated intention in his readie to
"write-with-Kodaks," there was in fact no machine particularly designed to
produce a readie, and Brown apparently had no intention of inventing one.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>

<p>
Without any such innovation, Brown was reduced to pretending that speeding
ordinary text past a magnifying glass would amount to "broadcasting
with no words at all" (<i>TR</i>, 3). This is perhaps what he meant
by his frequent claims that the reading machine would make language
purely optical for the first time in history. The influence of the
movies over the new medium is so strong that it allows Brown to feel
that mimicking the movement of cinema would somehow short-circuit the
conventional meanings of words and letters, allowing other, more genuine
meanings immediate access to the eye. Thus the readies are the purest
and most extreme realization of Jolas' dream of a logocinema. But even
the apparently simplistic claim to operate with no words at all contains
an intriguing complication, for it actually differs quite substantially
from the aims of most avant-garde typography and from the actual effect
of the readies themselves, which tend to make the type disturbingly
apparent. On the static page, most of the readies are in fact quite
difficult to read, and it is very hard to determine what, if anything,
a particular readie is about, so that attention quite naturally focuses
on the words themselves and on the surface effects&#8212;dashes, crosses,
arrows, and other dingbats&#8212;with which the readies are liberally
decorated. This is, of course, exactly the effect that much avant-garde
typographical experiment seeks to achieve, bringing the text itself to
consciousness by making it opaque to ordinary decoding and interpretation.

<p>
In this way Brown's readies come to resemble, at least superficially,
<i>An&eacute;mic Cin&eacute;ma</i>, the virtually contemporaneous
project of Marcel Duchamp, which is a film largely made out of moving
words. Together, Duchamp's film of words and Brown's words made into
film seem to exemplify the way in which the visual arts and literature
converged at this time within the common space opened up by the
movies. But there are also significant differences between the two
projects, for Duchamp turns his words

<b></b>

into moving objects as a way of exposing the materiality, even the gross
sensuality, of what is supposed to be a transparently signifying medium,
while Brown is hoping that movement will finally make his medium as
transparent as it has always longed to be. Perhaps these differences
demonstrate the very different stakes that artists and writers had in
the new media. On the other hand, Brown's readies, even in their static
printed form, end up resembling <i>An&eacute;mic Cin&eacute;ma</i>, as the
devices adopted to suggest movement carry no meaning but become opaque,
unreadable visual forms. Within the very desire for pure transparency,
there is a formal emphasis on the signifier itself that prevents the
mind from gliding effortlessly through it to the referent beyond. This is
not just a simple inconsistency, a failure of practice to match theory,
but rather the expression of a fundamental irony imported into modern
art and literature along with the photographic model, an irony whereby
avant-garde disruption and utopian transparency produce one another.

<p>
At the level of content, there is a similar irony that is even more
obvious and far more disconcerting. Anyone attempting to read the
readies finds that celebration of the medium itself is perhaps the most
common topic, so that many individual contributions, such as Norman
Macleod's "Ready: Revolution" (<i>RFBBM</i>, 53-54) or George Kent's
"Re . . . Readies" (<i>RFBBM</i>, 75), tend to exhort the reader
to discover what should have been implicitly apparent in the very
form of the work. Thus these utopian texts often carry a message of
international amity achieved through perfect communication, which is
entirely appropriate for a medium that was to guarantee that "conventional
word-prejudices will be automatically overcome."

<p>
The next most common subject after the readie revolution itself,
however, is one that casts considerable doubt of a very particular
kind on this utopian promise. Though "word-prejudices" may have been
banished from this new form of literature, other kinds of prejudice
clearly remain. There are in fact quite a few readies like "Jeff," by
James T. Farrell, which is about "Jeff the fat jewboy [who] pimped for
black babies in the black belt."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
 It is one of the peculiarities of the stripped-down telegraphic form of
 the readies that it is very difficult to distinguish authorial comment
 from first-person narration, and it is interesting to speculate that
 one of the things that the form acquires from its photographic model
 is an absence of irony. Thus, to be fair, it is difficult to determine
 exactly how Farrell wants us to take his celebration of the death of
 Jeff, or how Samuel Putnam wants us to take his readie, "Dirty Nigger,"
 though it seems somewhat clearer in this case that we are being given
 a quasi-photographic glimpse into the mind of a bigot. Perhaps this
 is even the case with Laurence Vail's "Pogrom," which intersperses
 blunt imperatives such as "club lowly Loeb" or "pop off Oppenheim"
 with lines of asterixes, dollar signs, and percentage marks.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
 Even this charitable interpretation, however, does not explain why
 a medium that was in and of itself to defeat prejudice should take
 racial hatred and violence as one of its most common subjects. And even
 the most charitable interpretation cannot do much with contributions
 like Nancy Cunard's wretched "Dlink," a wholly stereotypical look at
 a Chinese laundryman, replete with the most ridiculous lambdacisms,
 which actually ends "<i>No</i> ticky <i>no</i> land'y."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
As wholly reprehensible as this contribution is, it does represent some
very significant general inconsistencies in the readies as a collective
project. For the particular stereotype that Cunard relies on here has to
do entirely with pronunciation, with speech, which it would seem could
have no force in a purely optical medium. But, in fact, a great many
of the readies include large sections of speech and many are imagined,
as this one is, entirely as monologues, interior and otherwise. Cunard's
piece is particularly revealing because it shows how closely even these
writers, dedicated apparently to Brown's project of turning language into
film, rely on purely verbal phenomena, and how much these phenomena are
associated with racial and ethnic specificity of the kind the readies
were supposed to overcome. The return of speech in this supposedly visual
medium also marks the return of specific social characteristics to the
visual text that was to be universal. Perhaps the particular returns
in such virulently prejudicial forms precisely because it is denied any
other, more positive expression.

<p>
Yet this return to the specifically racial in what was supposed to be
"inter-racial" is not an aberration or an accident, for Brown actually
suggests elsewhere that race is intrinsic to his innovations. The very
few contemporary critics who have commented on Brown's work usually
rely rather heavily on the metaphor for moving type that Brown borrows
from Stephen Crane's first book of poems, <i>Black Riders and Other
Lines</i>. But even Jerome McGann, who takes the phrase as the title of
his excellent book on the typography of modernist literature, does not
mention that Brown's "black riders" were not just moving lines of type
or symbolic soldiers but also African Americans.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
 Brown was entranced by the contrast of "inky words at full gallop
 across the plains of pure white pages" (<i>TR</i>, 32-33), and he
 often drew on certain racial stereotypes to particularize the contrast:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
commaless-Cossacks-astride-mustang-bronchs- - - - -
<br />
vocabularies-leaning-farout-into-inky-night- - - - -
<br />
picking-up-carefully-placed-phrases-with-flashing- - - -
<br />
Afric-teeth. (<i>TR</i>, 38).
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Words in motion, words under renovation, often appear to Brown quite
literally as black bodies, as in his opening essay for <i>The Readies</i>,
where he says that authentic words show themselves when dropped in alcohol
like "little ivory-toothed nigger boys diving for pennies" (<i>TR</i>,
4). Certainly the most spectacularly literal of such identifications
appears as the colophon to Brown's book <i>1450-1950</i>, a collection
of handwritten visual poems, which identifies itself as having been


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
printed in the year
<br />
Gutenberg 479
<br />

<br />
A LITTLE NEGRO BOY BEING
<br />

<br />
TYPE TO GIVE THE PROPER COLOR
<br />
AND AFTERWARD DESTROYED
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What makes the text visible, that is to say, is race, conceived in the
most prejudicial and stereotypical way possible. Brown's riders are black
because the transformation of type into a visual image seems to involve
a change of race as well, as if mute, purely optical characters would
have to come from the continent Europe always considered to be silent,
without history.

<p>
What Brown confesses here strikes at the heart of his own project and at
the whole program for the visual renovation of literature pursued in the
pages of <i>transition</i>. For he confesses, even proclaims, that the
visual is not the most "automatic," least acculturated of the senses,
but rather the sense to which most prejudicial claims are traditionally
made. The visual is not innocent but rather deeply implicated in the
history and culture of the observer, which is, as Martin Jay maintains,
one of the things that the twentieth century discovered during its long
experience with the camera.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
 In fact, the close identification of ink with race in Brown's books
 suggests that without prejudice there would almost literally be nothing
 to see, as if it were precisely the mote in the eye that gives it
 something to perceive.

<p>
Brown's colophon also expresses a common modernist ambition to transform
particulars into pure form, to make specificities such as race disappear
into the abstractions of a universal sign system. The persistence of
race as a subject in the readies, however, demonstrates how difficult
it is to transmute the actual and incidental into form. Race, in this
sense, is the subject that refuses to be formalized, for the black body
simply cannot be ground up into ink. This is not simply a failure in
Brown's ambitions, however, but a necessary effect of the whole utopian
project to reduce specific verbal languages to a single utopian visual
script. In Brown's project, race exemplifies the inevitable noise,
the static, the pure particularity that is the necessary complement
of modernism's transparently pure forms. The drive toward a purified,
universal language, in other words, did not have the result of banishing
all the extraneous cultural material that had heretofore cluttered and
encumbered international communication. Instead, this project emphasized
recalcitrant, residual subject matter in the very process of trying to
bring it over into form.

<p>
It was, in fact, in playing out this paradox that the modernist
"Revolution of the Word" most closely resembled the new mechanical
arts of photography and film. Hailed from the very beginning as a new,
perfectly transparent means of inscription, as "words of light" in Fox
Talbot's famous phrase, the photograph also disconcertingly recorded
and preserved a welter of accidental detail that seemed not only opaque
but meaningless. Taming this detail was the task of those who hoped to
transform a mechanical recording medium into an art, but, as Benjamin
insisted, "there remains something that goes beyond testimony to the
photographer's art, something that cannot be silenced . . . and will
never consent to be wholly absorbed in 'art.'"
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
 The arrival of film renewed all of photography's original utopian
 promise as a medium that, in showing all, could reach everyone, and at
 the same time dramatically disordered what was on the very threshold
 of becoming, in the hands of Stieglitz and the Photo-Secession, an
 accepted formalist art. At the beginning of the twentieth century,
 then, mechanization repeated the paradoxical process whereby it creates
 entirely new forms of representation,

<b></b>

apparently perfect in their automatism, while also bringing into being
entirely new categories of nonsense, noise produced by mechanized powers
of attention and retention that vastly exceed the human. Emulating film
helped Jolas and Brown to modernize their writing only in this sense,
that it involved them and their "Revolution of the Word" in the typically
modern impasse of pure form and resistant detail.

<blockquote>
<!--_epigraph-->
The sea has a <i>voice</i>, which is very changeable and almost always
audible. It is a voice which sounds like a thousand voices, and much
has been attributed to it: patience, pain, and anger. But what is most
impressive about it is its persistence. The sea never sleeps; by day
and by night it makes itself heard, throughout the years and decades and
centuries. In its impetus and its rage it brings to mind the one entity
which shares these attributes in the same degree: that is, the crowd.

Elias Canetti, <i>Crowds and Power</i>
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>Rivista Illustrata del Popolo d'Italia</i> was the lavish mass
distribution monthly to which subscribers of Italian Fascism's official
daily could turn for commentary on current events, literature, science,
culture and fashion, much like Americans could turn to <i>Life</i>
magazine, Russians could turn to <i>Soviet Life</i>, and the Chinese
to <i>China Reconstructs</i>. Starting sometime in the mid-1920s,
the <i>Rivista</i> underwent a graphic makeover. Among the innovations
introduced was the regular inclusion of large scale foldouts: panoramic
photographs, typically two to six times wider than the standard
page size. Foldouts in and of themselves were not uncommon in period
magazines and, as with contemporary foldouts of <i>Playboy</i> bunnies
or <i>Penthouse</i> pets, they were understood as special features,
graphic highlights detachable for purposes of exhibition in the home and
in the workplace. What first drew my attention to the <i>Rivista</i>'s
foldouts, however, was the object of desire draped across the picture
plane: teeming, seemingly infinite crowds rallying around a visible or
invisible leader, sometimes abstracted into an indistinct ocean of dots,
sometimes swarming with particulars; crowds wedged

<b></b>

into architectural settings representative of the great historical cities
of the Italian peninsula, crammed together to the point of driving out
all voids. The political rally as source of vicarious photo- and/or
pornographic thrill. Such was the graphic principle that would inform
the next fifteen years of the <i>Rivista Illustrata's</i> practice;
years during which wave after wave of innovative artists and graphic
designers laid out its pages: Bruno Munari, Mario Sironi, Fortunato
Depero, Gi&ograve; Ponti, Xanti Schawinsky. The graphic environment
shifted with each successive wave. But not the foldouts. Mass rally
after mass rally after mass rally unfolded in every number, right up to
the collapse of the Fascist regime and the review's demise.

<p>
The obvious reason for this persistence was the foldout's propaganda
value. The <i>Rivista</i> was much more than an Italian <i>Life</i>
magazine. It was a semi-official party organ. It set out to promote the
image of Fascism as a revolutionary movement and of Fascist Italy as a
perpetually mobilized nation. Yet the notion of propaganda raises more
questions than it answers. It tells one next to nothing about the nature
and the variety of the images placed in circulation or about the contours
of the socio-political imaginary which they hoped to tap into and to
shape. Nor does it address the larger question of where and how these
mass photographic panoramas fit into the broader stream of crowd images
that arises in European culture in the wake of the French Revolution,
a topic that has been addressed, though in a far from definitive manner,
by culture critics such as Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin and
art historians such as Wolfgang Kemp.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Last but not least, the invocation of a propagandistic function
 does not help one to understand how and why mass panoramas became
 intertwined with the art of photomontage and, with slight though
 significant variations, circulated not only in inter-war Italy,
 Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and the Soviet Union,
 but also in the postwar period from the Chinese Cultural Revolution
 up through the North Korea of Kim il Sung II.

<p>
So the topic of this essay is that literal specter of the Enlightenment
known as the revolutionary crowd, hovering between reason and
hallucination, between the emancipatory dreams of 1789 and the terror
of 1793, and the mass public's inscription as a graphic element within
modern political art and the new print-centered public sphere. The
process of inscription is not reducible to a single story line. Viewed
from the standpoint of artistic technique, it is the tale of an evolving
repertoire of, first, painterly and, then, photographic practices. Viewed
from an art-historical standpoint, it is the story of a complex of
differentiated but overlapping iconographies of the crowd, of their
place within the history of panoramic modes of representation, and of
their apparent ebb in the present cultural-historical moment. Viewed
from an intellectual-historical standpoint, it is the story of how these
practices and iconographies were influenced by millennium-long habits
of metaphorizing, gendering, and abstracting human crowds, central to
political philosophy at least as early as Aristotle and as late as
Elias Canetti; habits decisively altered by late eighteenth century
theorizations of the sublime. Viewed from a socio-political standpoint,
the story is that of the rise of a politics founded upon principles
of popular sovereignty and of the consequent need for new images and
mythologies of the collectivity as well as models of political action

<b></b>

and agency based upon the literal physical massing of bodies in public
spaces or the performance of symbolic marches and mobilizations in real
space and time.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 A multilayered tale, in short, as difficult to contain within the
 bounds of a single essay as are the oceanic masses enframed within the
 foldouts of the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i>. All this by way of an apology
 for the schematic character of the following narrative, a narrative
 that will lead the reader on a series of suggestive rather than
 exhaustive zigzags through the analytical strata just described. The
 stopping points in the narrative bear the subtitles: "Tides," "Types,"
 "Tiles" and "Spillways<i>." "</i>Tides" concerns the oceanic metaphor
 as applied to crowds. "Types" sketches out the history of what will
 be referred to as "emblematic" crowd images. "Tiles" describes the
 development of "oceanic" mass panoramas with respect to the prior
 emblematic tradition. "Spillways" deals with the transformation of
 "oceanic" fragments back into geometrical emblems within the context
 of modernist photomontage, while reflecting briefly on the possibility
 that rallying multitudes no longer serve as the pillar upon which are
 built contemporary models of political action.

<p>
The phrase <i>la folla oceanica</i> (the oceanic mass) was the label
applied both by viewers and producers to the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i>
foldouts. The phrase is ubiquitous in early twentieth century Italian
political discourse, whether nationalist, socialist, or anarchist. But
nowhere more so than in Fascist oratory where it served to enforce
Fascism's claim that it alone knew how to catalyze and to channel
the mighty and mysterious forces that characterized the <i>era of
crowds</i>. The "era of crowds" was the definition of modernity proposed
in Gustave Le Bon's 1895 classic, <i>Psychologie des foules</i> and
in the works of crowd psychology that influenced it by authors such as
Taine and Tarde, as well as by members of the Italian Positivist school
(Ferri, Lombroso, Sighele, Rossi). Le Bon affirmed: "While all our
ancient beliefs are tottering and disappearing, while the old pillars
of society are giving way one by one, the power of the crowd is the only
force that nothing menaces, and of which the prestige is continually on
the increase."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Premodern multitudes had long been imagined as elemental hordes to be
 shaped and subjugated from on high; modern multitudes were the volatile
 protagonists of a volatile era, leaders themselves as well as breeding
 grounds for new forms of leadership and individualism. Nothing menaced
 their power because of an inherent heterogeneity and instability:
 they were the result of the promiscuous intermingling and physical
 massing of social classes, age groups, races, nationalities, and
 genders along the great boulevards of the industrial metropolis. Their
 prestige was continually on the increase because everything modern was
 potentially at their beck and call: political authority, the state,
 commerce, communications, culture, economic production. Brought into
 being thanks to the loss of conscious personality that was purported to
 occur when human bodies agglomerate, the modern crowd is not reducible
 to the average of the individuals that make it up, but rather sets off
 a chain reaction like those that fascinated Le Bon in his writings on
 atomic particles: "just as in chemistry certain elements,

<b></b>

when brought into contact&#8212;bases and acids, for
example&#8212;combine to form a new body possessing properties quite
different from those of the bodies that have served to form it," so it
is with the crowd.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 His socialist counterpart Ferri shared the same thought:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Collective psychology concerns not the simple mixing of individual
elements, but rather their chemical combination. This means that the
resulting psychic collective is not equal to the sum of its individual
psychic parts (and this is the case both on the plane of feelings and that
of ideas). On the contrary, it is always different, either for the better
or for the worse, in precisely the same manner as a chemical combination
of two or more substances confers upon the final mass a temperature that
is higher or lower than that of the bodies that make it up.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The properties in question are the result of multiple liquids combined in
a single test tube always with an uncertain outcome: a new substance,
an explosion, a surge of energy, accelerated decay, a fizzle, new
fermentations.

<p>
In <i>Psychologie des foules</i> Le Bon rarely assimilates the modern
mob to tides, open seas or ocean storms, but he did not need to. The
association was firmly established in the Western socio-political
imagination long before the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i> foldouts were
routinely imagined as portraits of human oceans and long before Scipio
Sighele probed the criminal crowd as a "perilous sea . . . whose surfaces
are whipped up by every psychological wind."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 This is attested to in a wide array of nineteenth century literary
 sources. Early instances are Wordsworth's perception of London as a
 "perpetual flow / Of trivial objects, melted and reduced / To one
 identity by differences / That have no law, no meaning, and no end
 . . ." and De Quincey's hallucinatory vision of the London cityscape as
 an ocean "paved with innumerable faces, upturned to the heavens: faces,
 imploring, wrathful, despairing, surg[ing]; upwards by the thousands,
 by myriads, by generations, by centuries . . ."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Other accounts are less nightmarish, like "the tumultuous sea of human
 heads" that fills the narrator of Poe's <i>Man of the Crowd</i> with
 "a delicious novelty of emotion" and Baudelaire's seminal writings
 on the industrial metropolis, where modern individualism is made to
 hinge upon a dandy-bather navigating his way through aquatic multitudes.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 The metaphor has become a constant by the end of the nineteenth century,
 shaping everything from Zola and Huysman's evocations of spectral urban
 (Paris) and rural (Lourdes) crowds to Maupassant's &eacute;litist
 reflections in <i>Sur l'Eau</i> on how individual wills blend with the
 common will like "a drop of water is blended with and lost in a river"
 to the promise lodged at the climax of the 1909 Founding Manifesto
 of Futurism that futurists will "sing the multicolored and polyphonic
 tidal waves of revolution in modern capitals . . ."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
The "oceanic crowd" is, in point of fact, far more ancient, traceable at
least as far back as the longstanding conflation in Greco-Roman culture
of <i>turbulence</i>, whether maritime, meteorological, or political,
with the <i>turba</i> which is to say, the mob. The pairing animates
much of ancient political theory as, for example, the characteristic
passage in Cicero's <i>De re publica</i>, where he asserts that "there
is no sea so hard to calm and no fire so hard to check as the vengeance
of the unrestrained mob."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 (Better,

<b></b>

accordingly, to build cities destined for permanence and imperial might,
like Athens and Rome, at a remove from the ocean and its proletarian
tides.)
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 The re recurs in a celebrated simile from the opening book of
 Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And just as, often, when a crowd of people
<br />
Is rocked by a rebellion, and the rabble (<i>ignobilevulgus</i>)
<br />
Rage in their minds, and firebrands and stones
<br />
Fly fast&#8212;for fury finds its weapons&#8212;if,
<br />
By chance, they see a man remarkable
<br />
For righteousness and service, they are silent
<br />
And stand attentively; and he controls
<br />
Their passion by his words and cools their spirits:
<br />
So all the clamor of the sea subsided. . .
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In ancient thought, the man "remarkable for righteousness and service"
(<i>pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum</i>), the queller of
revolutionary tumults and navigator of stormy seas, the <i>gubernator</i>,
is radically unlike, radically "other" to the always feminized rabble. He
is a godlike being like the goddess-born hero of Virgil's epic, <i>pius
Aeneas</i>; a subduer of his passions and the passions of others,
not a fomenter. Le Bon and his Italian counterparts are well aware
that what changes in the era of industry is less the volatility of the
crowd or a newly favorable characterization of this volatility than the
lineage of this superior being. No longer the monarch, the aristocrat,
or the godlike man; no longer the tyrant imagined as the rabble's
monstrous counterpart; he is the man of the crowd: at once immanent
and transcendent, at once an insider and an outsider, at once everyman
and the exceptional individual who provides the masses with a singular
identity, a singular face, a mirror image of a sovereign collectivity that
is now always in motion (in motion, because, in conflict with classical
political theory, motion&#8212;not stasis&#8212;has become the normative
state of healthy collectivities). Fully swept up in the multicolored
and polyphonic waves of modern revolution, he is able to channel
their tidal fury towards higher and nobler ends: national sovereignty,
liberty, empire, progress. An early name of his is Leviathan, as famously
red in the 1651 frontispiece illustrating the Hobbesian principle of
contractual political representation according to which the sovereign is
simultaneously understood as the power that forces individual citizens
into a single body politic and as the expression of their collective will.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 (<a name="1" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#1"> 1</a>) The
 body of citizens that composes Leviathan's body, what Herbert Spencer
 referred to as the <i>macanthrope</i>, is made up of the natural motions
 of individual minds whose interaction gives rise to an ideal collective
 motion signaled by a reciprocal exchange of gazes. The multitude faces
 its own face and vice versa in an act of mirroring that allows for
 no fundamental ontological gap between leader and led. This orderly
 model of the formation of the body politic will provide one of the
 richest veins for mass panoramic representations of the type that I
 will subsequently refer to as the <i>emblematic</i>. The emblematic
 mass so pervades the history of Western group portraiture until the
 modern era that exceptions are usually limited to battlefield scenes
 (Paolo Uccello's <i>Battle of San Romano</i>) or to representations
 of the unruly damned being herded by infernal

<b></b>

taskmasters. What prevails instead are the geometrically arrayed choirs
that surround the Redeemer in vast tableaux of total order like Fra
Angelico's <i>Christ Glorified in the Court of Heaven</i> and Giotto's
Arena Chapel <i>Last Judgment</i>, along with secular avatars. The
emblematic mass is but the tradition bound, dry land counterpart of
the <i>oceanic</i> mass and to set sail on the latter, a more dynamic
cognitive model is required that would allow the sovereign individual
to emerge while being immersed in the mob, to control while being
controlled. The model in question is provided by theorizations of the
sublime.

<p>
Oceanic imagery proliferates in treatises on the sublime no less than it
does in ancient political theory. Already in Longinus, the <i>Iliad</i>
was sublime because of "the flood of moving incidents in quick succession,
the versatile rapidity and actuality, brimful of images drawn from real
life," whereas in the far less sublime <i>Odyssey</i>, it is as if "the
ocean had shrunk into its lair and lay becalmed within its own confines."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 In Addison, Burke and especially Kant, the ocean is the horizontal
 counterpart to the vertical mountainscapes that precipitate in
 the viewer a simultaneous sense of vertigo and of its overcoming,
 of control and loss of control, of thrill and an expanded sense of
 selfhood. In the contemplation of vast, formless, seemingly infinite
 objects in nature, a mental movement is initiated that allows us "to
 see sublimity in the ocean, regarding it, as the poets do, according
 to what the impression upon the eye reveals, as let us say, in its
 calm, a clear mirror of water bounded only by the heavens, or, be it
 disturbed, as threatening to overwhelm and engulf everything."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 The scene's excess with respect to the imagination's ability to
 comprehend the whole renders a plunge into the abyss inevitable:
 "the boundless ocean rising with rebellious force, the high waterfall
 of some mighty river and the like, make our power of resistance of
 trifling moment in comparison

<b></b>

with their might" (<i>COJ</i>, 110). Yet the plunge is productive because
it is controlled: "provided our own position is secure, their aspect
is all the more attractive for its fearfulness . . ." (<i>COJ</i>,
110). Kant's proviso regarding the need for a secure perch as a
precondition for experiencing the sublime will come under increasing
pressure in the course of the nineteenth century, but the key point
here is the convergence between the Ciceronian-Virgilian revolutionary
<i>turba</i> and a new theorization of land- and seascapes.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Nineteenth century culture will turn out large numbers of panoramic
 images of natural landscapes. It will also turn out large numbers of
 calm and disturbed seascapes. Last but not least, it will give rise
 to a new iconography of human oceanscapes within the framework of the
 political sublime.

<p>
As already indicated, the field of modern mass panoramas appears evenly
split between emblematic and oceanic representations. My case study for
the former will be the photographic tableaux of the turn-of-the-century
American evangelical/military photographer Arthur S. Mole; my case study
for the latter will be the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i> foldouts.

<p>
Born in 1889, Mole was a follower of the faith healer John Alexander
Dowie, founder of the Christian Catholic Church, whose fiery brand of
evangelism informed a number of early mass photographic experiments
seemingly extending back to the time of the foundation in 1901 of Zion,
Illinois.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Zion was established as a Christian utopia, combining revivalism
 with millenarianism, industry with piety, proselytizing via the
 media&#8212;the Church's illustrated weekly newspaper, <i>Leaves of
 Healing</i>, was distributed world-wide&#8212;with the elaboration of
 mass spectacles including an annual Passion Play. The city included
 the Zion Lace Factory (brought over from Nottingham, England),
 baking and candy factories, a printing and publishing house (and,
 later, a radio station)&#8212;like everything else in Zion, owned by
 the Church&#8212;and a tabernacle large enough to hold ten thousand
 faithful.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Within the setting of this evangelical community, mass panoramic
 photography assumed a role right from the start to judge by the fact
 that in July 1904 the noted Chicago panoramicist George R. Lawrence
 was hired to document a series of parades, prayer meetings, and
 consecrations.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
Mole's work built upon Lawrence's legacy. His earliest mass photographic
experiments were collective portraits, bearing titles such as "The Cross
and the Crown" and "The Zion Shield" or spelling out Biblical quotations,
staged with members of the congregation during the years immediately
preceding and following the outbreak of World War I.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 It appears that the resulting photographs were published in <i>Leaves
 of Healing</i> and/or sold to the sitters and to outsiders, with
 profits going to the church. Two characteristic examples of Mole's
 work are "The Nine O'Clock Hour of Prayer or the Living Clock" 
 and "The Reverend John Alexander Dowie" . (<a name="2"
 href="9.2schnapp_res.html#2"> 2</a>) The first marks
 the Christian Catholics' practice, inspired in turn by Roman
 Catholic monastic practice, of interrupting the day at dawn and
 dusk&#8212;conventionally designated

<b></b>

as the ninth hour or nones&#8212;with a minute of prayer and
meditation. The clock is "living" thus not only inasmuch as a mechanical
artifact is brought to life by being embodied by the members of the
congregation, but also inasmuch as time is sacralized by the hour of
prayer, transformed into the time well spent that leads to salvation
and eternal life. The second celebrates the 21st anniversary of the
consecration of the Christian Catholic Church's tabernacle and city
(Zion) by means of a "living" portrait that combines human bodies with
stage props.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 In between these pious compositions, Mole turned to military
 photography, working in close collaboration with John D. Thomas, the
 leader of the Zion White Robed Choir, who became his crowd manager
 and producer. Together they turned out dozens of photographs, most
 commissioned by specific battalions and sold to battalion members,
 such as "The Living American Flag" (1917; 10,000 sitters), "The Human
 Statue of Liberty" (1918; 18,000 sitters); "The Living Liberty Bell"
 (1918; 25,000 sitters), "The Living Uncle Sam" (1919; 19,000 sitters),
 "The Human U.S. Shield" (1918; 30,000 sitters), and their famous
 portrait of Woodrow Wilson (1918; 21,000 sitters). (<a name="3"
 href="9.2schnapp_res.html#3"> 3</a>) By the end of the war,
 Mole and Thomas's success was such that they very nearly persuaded
 the American armed services to permit them to cross the Atlantic so
 as to shoot the most massive living portrait ever assembled: a clock
 marking the eleventh hour, portrayed by the <i>entirety</i> of the
 American armed forces stationed in Europe.

<p>
The technique developed by Mole for purposes of these mass compositions
was ingenious and based upon aerial surveying practices. A 70-80
foot tower was rigged up out of two by fours and steadied by means of
cables. Once he was atop the tower, armed with an oversized 11-14-inch
view camera mounted to the tower's flank, Mole would superimpose
a transparency bearing an image over the camera's ground glass
plate&#8212;inverting the drafting process employed with the camera
obscura&#8212;and then proceed to bark out orders via a megaphone to a
ground crew, directed by Thomas, whose job it was to mark out the image
across the landscape. (When the distances

<b></b>

involved were beyond the megaphone's range, a white flag was used for
signaling.) The tableau was to appear undistorted, as if level with the
picture plane, which meant both extreme, anamorphic-type distortions
on the ground and visual torsion between the receding landscape in the
backdrop (usually barracks) and an emblem that always looks as if it were
standing straight up. (In the case of the Wilson portrait, for instance, a
mere hundred soldiers were required for the president's shoulder region as
contrasted with the several thousand who make up the top of his head.) Up
to a week of preparatory work was required to survey the landscape,
trace sitter positions, and make calculations regarding the exact number
of soldiers required and their distribution according to hat and uniform
types. The actual shoot consisted in a literal close-order military drill,
requiring long periods of standing at attention in precise formation.

<p>
Mole's technique may have been novel, but his compositions were
not. Various branches of the armed services and, in particular, members
of veteran groups such as the Grand Army of the Republic, had been
composing living flags, inscriptions, and symbols in athletic stadiums
and on marching grounds at least as early as the final decades of the
nineteenth century. Other photographers, such as Simes and Campbell
and Eugene O. Goldbeck, also found a highly profitable niche market
in battalion portraiture. Nor were such compositions original in the
deeper sense that, like Abraham Bosse's <i>Leviathan</i> frontispiece,
they tap into a millennium of prior images&#8212;political,

<b></b>

metaphysical, theological--fusing the many and the one. This vast image
bank of idealized crowds&#8212;angels, saints, martyrs&#8212;arrayed as
signs encompasses to varying degrees acrostic and pattern poetry from
Porphyry to Rabanus Maurus to George Herbert to actual Renaissance
hieroglyphs; rations of celestial choirs in Last Judgment
scenes; and the Christian chiliastic imaginary with its last signs
and emblems of the faithful becoming one with and within the body of
Christ. A case in point is Dante's <i>Paradise</i> with its kinetic
skywriting(illustrated by Dante's near contemporary, Giovanni di Paolo)
and its succession of symbols formed by the blessed&#8212;circles, cross,
eagle, and ladder&#8212;that lead the way to a face-to-face vision of
God and the Holy Jerusalem. The jump from holy to secular athletes,
martyrs to soldiers, angels to Tiller Girls, formations in heaven to
military parades, political rallies or football halftime shows, is easy
to accomplish. However seemingly distant from the scene of the modern
era of crowds, the same transcendental imaginary continues to shape
secular utopias. Consider the case of someone aesthetically distant
from Mole's "living" clocks: L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, Bauhaus
professor and the author in 1925 both of conventional photojournalistic
oceanic crowd scenes like "Up with the United Front," shot in order
to celebrate a Berlin Factory Workers Association demonstration, as
well as of the "Dream of the Boarding School Girls." (<a name="4"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#4"> 4</a>) The latter photomontage
shows how, in the spirit of Von Laban's eurhythmics and various
other group sports-hygiene-biomechanics movements, the bodies of
dancers and athletes are released from the laws of gravitation and
this release is placed along the path of a group of schoolgirls,
arrayed in a receding H formation (perhaps the initial of their
boarding school). The dreamed-of passage from one geometry, a more
restrictive one associated with the regime of acquiring literacy,
to another, associated with enticing new erotic-machinic geometries,
is not out of line with Arthur Mole's twenty-one thousand soldiers
cast in the image of Woodrow Wilson. Certainly no more so than are El
Lissitzky's 1931 photogram of Lenin and its Fascist twin, the 1934
<i>One Heart Alone</i> referendum poster in which the mob provides
a receding ground for Mussolini's profile. (. <a name="5"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#5">5</a> and <a name="6"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#6">6</a>) (Though there are differences
between Mole's representationalism and Moholy's abstractionism, as well
as between the sheer frontality of Lissitzky's Lenin and the lateral
exchange of gazes staged in <i>One Heart Alone</i>.) The same would go
for Fascist, Communist and liberal-democratic experiments with everything
from mass gymnastic exhibitions to "living writing" to stadium flip-card
shows to the mass dance drills of Busby Berkeley. The Holy Jerusalem may
be located in Leningrad, Rome, Mao's China, Hollywood or Zion, Illinois,
but the formal principle as well as its ideological underpinnings remain
analogous: out of the multitude emerges the face of the leader, the logos,
the hieroglyph, the crux, in what is at once an allegory of collective
transcendence and a trans-cultural form of play.

<p>
To underscore the continuities between pre-modern and modern emblematic
representations of the crowd is not to overlook obvious divergences,
like the increasing interest among post-1789 artists in panoramic modes
of representation; shifts in perspective, medium, and scale; variations
in the semiological status of emblems themselves. My aim, rather, has
been to establish the simultaneous existence of old emblematic practices
with the new oceanic ones, so as to suggest that the one

<b></b>

interpenetrates the other. For all their formal divergences and
differences in use, procedure, and location, for all the seeming (and
illusory) absence of emblematic artifice in oceanic crowd scenes, both
the emblematic and the oceanic are reducible, in the end, to allegories
of crowd control. They serve as dialectical counterparts of one another,
the first emphasizing the moment of transcendence when the one emerges
out of the many; and the second emphasizing the moment of immanence in
which the one taps into the tidal power of the multitudes.

<p>
But if these are images of crowd control, what is the nature and degree of
the control in question? What are the precise techniques by means of which
a head is placed on the otherwise headless mob? And what are the formal,
technological, and ideological variables involved? In the case of the
<i>Rivista Illustrata del Popolo d'Italia</i> foldouts, an adequate answer
requires a look back at the earlier history of panoramas. Understood in
the strictest sense, the word "panorama," of course, refers to 360 degree
representations. The term and device were patented by their inventor,
the Irishman Robert Barker, to promote an "IMPROVEMENT ON PAINTING, Which
relieves that sublime Art from a Restraint it has ever labored under."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 Such relief began its transformation into a mass phenomenon with the
 opening in London on 14 March, 1789, of "Mr. Barker's Interesting and
 Novel View of the City and Castle of Edinburgh, and the Whole Adjacent
 and Surrounding Country." Enormously successful both with elite and
 popular audiences, the show quickly gave rise to imitations. Within
 a few years similar panoramas were touring France, Germany, and the
 United States; within decades they would span the world. Barker's
 original patent meticulously details the various lighting techniques,
 ventilation systems, and pictorial techniques that are required in
 order to make the viewer feel "as if he is really on the very spot."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 The illusion was enforced by restricting the viewer's bodily position
 and movement to the center of the rotunda and screening his view of the
 upper and lower edges. Barker had little to say about the elaboration
 of the circular image, but subsequent documentation shows that it
 was based upon segmentation or "tiling." A camera obscura or similar
 framing device would be positioned at a fixed location and rotated such
 that drawings could be generated one frame at a time. The resulting
 frames would then have to be smoothed together by the artist so as to
 create an illusion of a seamless whole, with adjustments made so as
 to project straight lines from frame to frame along the curved surface
 of the canvas.

<p>
A few points need to be highlighted regarding the panorama's history,
for they carry over directly to panoramic photography. Intended as a
method for emancipating painting&#8212;read "early photography"&#8212;by
way of rendering it an even more sublime art, the panorama set out to
wed an unbounded new sort of sublimity with an unbounded new sort of
realism. Through the combination of the two, the spectator was to find
himself transported directly to "the very spot" of observation, which
usually meant somewhere else, somewhere other, somewhere novel&#8212;like
Edinburgh seen from on high viewed in downtown London, or London
itself viewed from some astounding new angle. The spot in question,
in other words, was precisely the sort of elevated, dislocated perch
that Kant would have demanded for secure experiences of the vertigo,
terror, and excitement that accompany the viewing of seemingly formless,
infinite, and overpowering, natural objects. Early panoramas rose to the
double challenge of infusing what the era understood as hyperrealism with
sensations of thrill and transport through recourse to vertiginous bird's
eye perspectives, whether of cityscapes, as in Joshua Atkinson's 1807 view
of Saint Petersburg and an anonymous 1845 anamorphic view of London, or of
mountainscapes like that of Loch Lomond, Scotland, painted for exhibition
in London by John Knox in 1810. Cityscapes and mountainscapes would long

<b></b>

remain the standard panoramic fare, but they were soon flanked by scenes
of exotic landscapes, fires, explosions, and disasters at sea (as in the
works of the Austrian painter Hubert Sattler, whose "Storm in the North
Sea" was considered the masterpiece of his London 1824 <i>Cosmorama</i>
because, "sublime beyond description," it was "so perfect and true to
nature it almost made one shudder"
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
); as well as by the great land and sea battles of world history:
Aboukir, Ostende, Agincourt, Moscow and, last but hardly least, Waterloo,
as illustrated by Louis Dumoulin's immense turn-of-the-twentieth century
<i>Panorame de la bataille de Waterloo</i>.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Tourism, flight and fright; hallucination; the promise or threat
 of accident; oscillation between a sense of expanded selfhood made
 available through access to an all-encompassing gaze and a sense of
 selfhood endangered because being encircled and engulfed; illusory
 participation in history's most dramatic events; estrangement of the
 familiar: panoramas traded in these pleasures and others, only to
 be overrun by a medium that represented yet another "improvement on
 painting": photography.

<p>
The very fact that panoramas were built up out of segmented frames drawn
up by turning about a fixed axis made the shift over to photography a
natural. Yet there were obstacles. Standard daguerreotype plate formats
remained too small to achieve effects "sublime beyond description." And
there was the question of how to smooth out transitions between frames due
to the distortions introduced by the camera lens, particularly towards
the edges of wide-angle images. The solution lay in the use of oversize
cameras and in a modified tiling or montage procedure.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 One early pioneer was George N. Bernard who produced panoramic surveys
 of battlefields for the Union Army during the American Civil War,
 making use of multiple wet-plate glass negatives, assembled into single
 images in his studio by means of cropping and trimming.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Another innovator, as in so many other domains, was Edward Muybridge. In
 1877 Muybridge carried an enormous custom camera up to the top
 of California Street Hill and shot the second expanded version of
 his famous 360 degree <i>Panorama of San Francisco</i>, composed of
 thirteen panels, each 20.5-by-16-inches in size, adding up to a total
 length of seventeen feet.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Muybridge's practice was to shoot his images with enough overlap so
 that, by means of cropping an inch and a half vertically and two inches
 horizontally, distortions could be limited and the individual panels
 could be bled into one another so as to seem more or less continuous.

<p>
I must confess that when I first became intrigued by the <i>Rivista
Illustrata del Popolo d'Italia</i> foldouts, I assumed that these
painterly and photographic precedents, from Barker to Muybridge, had been
largely superseded by the development and commercial production at the
end of the nineteenth century of swing-lens cameras (like the Al-Vista,
whose lens wheeled around 180 degrees while the film and camera body
were held still) and rotational cameras (like the Cirkut, in which the
entire camera wheeled in one direction, while the film turned in another).
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Devised to feed the public's seemingly unlimited hunger for Alpine
 scenes, city views, battle scenes, and pictures of military assemblies,
 such panoramic images were a favorite for stereopticons and similar
 optical devices. So I red that Fascist era press photographers
 had simply embraced these new tools, shifting the content from sublime
 mountainscapes

<b></b>

to sublime multitudes. This seemed to explain why, like stereopticon
photos, their output was rarely panoramic in the strict 360 degree sense
and why the images themselves were so meticulously turned out that an
untrained eye struggles in vain to locate crop marks or distortions
of the sort that abound in Bernard and Muybridge. Close study of the
actual photographs and a visit to the Luce Archive in Rome revealed
these assumptions to be false. On the contrary, I discovered that there
exists a direct genealogical link between the painted panoramas of the
nineteenth century and the mass panoramic foldouts. Far from representing
just an urban counterpart to rural landscape photography, the latter
are actually works of what is perhaps best labeled "documentarist
photomontage": photomontage deployed in the service of enhancing the
reality effect, which means the thrill effect, that can be achieved by
means of conventional press photography. Just as panoramic painting sought
to relieve the sublime art of painting of certain restraints seemingly
inherent to painting as a medium, so mass panoramic photography seeks to
relieve photojournalism of certain prosaic obligations and sets out to
transport the viewer right to the very event. In the process of doing so,
it deploys a battery of techniques to structure a particular experience of
the event and to characterize the event itself as providing an opportunity
for secular communion. Mass panoramic photographs, in short, are trick
"realist" photographs, tiled and smoothed together just like their
nineteenth century ancestors, but juiced up by means of photomontage
and other forms of visual sleight of hand.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
The earliest of the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i> photographs date from
November, 1926. Some,like the stadium scene of a Fascist rally in
Bologna, hint at their ancestry, bearing the legend: "The photograph
represents only one sector of the Lictorial stadium as is evident
when you consider the stadium's elliptical form" ("La fotografia non
rappresenta che <i>un</i> settore del Littoriale come &egrave; evidente
quando si considera la forma elittica"); an invitation for the spectator
to imagine the image as if it followed the curvature of the stands,
potentially all the way around the entire ellipse. Later images, like a
September 1937 six-panel image of a rally in Sicily, play upon the very
same sense of curvature to intensify the sense of grandeur and boundless
space. (<a name="7" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#7"> 7</a>)
The dictator is thrust out into the picture plane on a prow-like
geometrical podium coursing across a seemingly infinite human ocean
that gives way, in turn, to a literal sea. Nested in the image
is the dictator's double, the cameraman. The man with a camera
is a standard feature of Italian mass panoramas. (<a name="8"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#8"> 8</a>) A literal man of the
crowd, the cameraman's immersion in the mob represents a guarantee
of closeness and susceptibility to its tidal surges. But he is also
always already high on the podium, hovering above. His is a hybrid
perspective merging a god's eye, overhead perspective with the view
from the ground. Which is to say that, like the dictator, the cameraman
must also be understood as a catalyst of revolutionary surges. He does
not simply reproduce tidal flows, but rather <i>produces</i> them just
like the dictator-demiurge who is at once immanent and transcendent with
respect to the masses.

<p>
The productive (as contrasted with the <i>re-</i>productive) work of the
photographer begins with the choice of an elevated orthogonal perspective
like that long before perfected by panorama painters, a case in point
being the June 1930 eight-panel foldout of a mass rally in Milan. (<A
NAME="9" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#9"> 9</a>) Here one
is dealing with a true example of an oceanic-type

<b></b>

image, not only tiled together in the conventional manner,
but also composed like a photo-mosaic, in which the masses appear
everywhere and the leader nowhere. As anyone who has ever visited
Milan's Piazza del Duomo can readily attest, the perspective that it
offers is a highly artificial construction, closer to a Byzantine than
a single-point perspectival scheme. The square has been wedged open,
transformed into a trapezoid, splayed so as to create the illusion of a
vaster architectural setting and, therefore, of a vaster human ocean: an
illusion not of <i>enhanced</i> but of <i>compressed</i> depth inasmuch
as the buildings have been rotated off the central pictorial axis in
the process of expanding the horizon line and the entire backdrop of
the image has been pulled forward toward the surface of the picture
plane. The ultimate effect of the

<b></b>

visual splay is paradoxical in a way that typifies the genre. On the one
hand, it creates a sense of closeness and impending encroachment, as if
the cityscape were opening up to enfold the viewer within the crowd's
surge. On the other, it raises the viewer above and beyond the crowd,
to an elevated perch, perhaps so elevated as to identify the panoramic
camera eye with the gaze of il Duce.

<p>
This precise repertory of perspectival and editing
techniques&#8212;tiling, cropping, cutting, pasting, masking, even
airbrushing&#8212;was refined over the course of the following decade. It
in no way pre-empted recourse to other sorts of sublime crowd imagery,
whether to diagonally angled Soviet-style single frames, emblematic mass
sporting scenes, parading soldiers disappearing into sunbursts<b>,</b>
mass images of specific sub-crowds&#8212;mass accordionists, mass
sportsmen and women, mass regional groups dressed in traditional folk
costumes. But its most characteristic products remain panoramas like the
photo-mosaic of Hitler's May 1938 visit to Naples: a composite image
of the Piazza del Plebiscito fabricated out of at least five separate
photographs. (. <a href="9.2schnapp_res.html#0" name="0">10-14</a>) As revealed by a close inspection of the
component "tiles," what has been

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 262]</b>

edited out of the image are a series of "distractions": gaps in the
crowd, electrical cables rising up to the top of the various lighting
and loudspeaker towers, military groups parading at opposite ends of the
Piazza, a fleet of destroyers shrouded in the mist of the Bay of Naples.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 The square itself has once again been pried open so as to strengthen
 the feeling of density and sprawl, while pulling the horizon line
 forward. Every graphic feature of the image has been manipulated to
 enhance the exclusive focus on the masses, on their energy, their power
 and potential heroism, their sense of expectation. But expectation of
 what? Or to frame the question otherwise, what is it that ensures that
 this particular oceanic mass provides a sublime rather than nightmarish
 viewing experience or that the masses in question will be recognized
 as potential agents of national redemption rather than as a lawless
 destructive horde? The question might well be asked of every one of
 the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i> foldouts. The answer involves not only
 the careful juggling of visual proximity and distance, horizontality

<b></b>

and verticality, played out by means of camera placement and cropping
practices that identify the camera eye itself with or as an external
ordering agent, as a kind of deus ex machina, like the leader himself;
but also two other factors: first, a set of internal "content controls";
second, a set of strategies of contextualization.

<p>
In the case of the first&#8212;i.e. the internal "content"
controls&#8212;the crowds depicted in the <i>Rivista</i> foldouts are
tightly choreographed. Not as tightly choreographed as the Rockettes
or as Mole's Christian Catholic congregations, but spontaneous only in
part. They typically brought together ordinary citizens with elements
from the Fascist youth, after-work, and trade groups, bussed in from
throughout the provinces so as to ensure a full and enthusiastic house. In
their midst circulated preprinted placards and rally coordinators ready
to cheerlead a pre-established repertoire of chants at the appropriate
cue. Also in their midst circulated members of the secret police,
invisible agents of surveillance and control paired with more visible
agents like the Luce cameramen. But the frequent presence of uniformed
members of the Militia, army and National Fascist Party is perhaps more
significant because it calls attention to the intimate connection between
emblematic and oceanic crowd images. In many images, these disciplined
crowds within the crowd, arrayed in the form of rectangles, squares, and
Fascist axe blades, interpenetrate the oceanic mass so as to hint at the
translatability of the one into the other. Perhaps it's just a matter of
time before everyone joins a formation and wears a uniform; perhaps it's
simply a matter of differing degrees of mobilization and ideological
commitment. Whatever the case may be, there is an emblem buried in
every oceanic representation. Sometimes it floats to the surface as in
the case of a September 1938 photo-mosaic from Padua. (<a name="5"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#5"> 15</a>) Sometimes it is buried
so deeply that its contours merge with those of the picture itself.

<p>
In the specific case of Fascist mass panoramas, the emblem in question,
whether a buried hatchet or the visage of il Duce, is characterized
by the fact that the mass choreographies rarely occur on a naked
stage. Architectural settings&#8212;Roman ruins, Renaissance and Baroque
palaces, Risorgimento squares&#8212;remind the viewer that the crowd
portrayed is not the timeless, placeless, faceless socialist crowd
rallying around abstract principles, but rather a <i>national</i> crowd,
shaped by a national sense of place, race and tradition, and rallying
around principles delimited by time and space. These architectures
from the past are brought into the present by means of banners. On the
occasion of the Naples 1938 rally, the banners, flags, towers, indeed,
the mass rally itself, all bespeak of the imminent appearance of two
leaders, planned for nightfall, at which time the Piazza del Plebiscito
was transformed into a Fascist phantasmagoria.

<p>
Earlier allusion was made to "strategies of contextualization" and it is
to these that I now turn inasmuch as they represent perhaps the single
most innovative development vis-&agrave;-vis the panoramic tradition and
the one of greatest potential interest for the history of photomontage
and the documentarist aesthetic of the 1920s and 1930s. The panoramas of
the prior century were meant to be experienced as autonomous artifacts,
hyperreal in their effect but spatially and temporally dislocated from,
and dislocating of, their viewing context. The <i>Rivista Illustrata</i>
foldouts, on the contrary, find themselves increasingly woven into a
thickly layered, "crowded" graphic environment

<b></b>

where crowd imagery interacts with images of the leader, experimental
typography, photomontages, drawings, and cartoons, always in meticulously
assembled sequences. On the one hand, this graphic thickness has a
symbolic purpose: that of casting the image of the masses in the image
of the leader and/or the state and vice versa as if the former, like
Baudelaire's dandy, were "a mirror as vast as the crowd itself."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 (<a name="6" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#6"> 16</a>) By
 means of a sustained visual dialogue, that is, the one is constantly
 presented as the inevitable counterpart of the other. On the other hand,
 the layering introduces a new dimension to panoramic representations,
 removing yet another "restraint" upon their potential sublime
 effect. That dimension is temporality: temporality in the double sense
 of narrative sequence and simultaneity. Much as in period newsreels,
 mass panoramas are increasingly framed as the climax that follows a
 step-by-step process of regional and/or national mobilization; a process
 that by definition involves simultaneous motion from a multiplicity
 of locations towards a single site, the site of the rally: a motion
 charted in photomontages and image sequences that, as if the tiles out
 of which the eventual photo-mosaic will be composed, are often times
 first presented serially, and then combined in a final triumphal vision
 in which all of these images and moments are seamlessly folded into the
 totality that is the mass panorama itself&#8212;a totality presumably
 meant to enfold the viewer in the moment of viewing. In other cases,
 the mass panorama appears earlier or even at the beginning of the
 sequence, as if its graphic hub or source.

<p>
I will now take the reader very quickly through two of the latter
sorts of sequences. The first dates from October, 1932, and crosscuts
the celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the March on Rome with
statistical data in a succession of images that leads from Fascism's
past to its future. The sequence runs:

<p>
1) the celebration of Fascism's Milanese origins and
of its martyrs on 16 October, 1932 (<a name="7"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#7"> 17</a>);

<p>
2) a panoramic representation of Fascism's present in the form of
a mass rally in Rome's Piazza Venezia, under the aegis of Mussolini
(who has been cropped out of the upper middle portion of the picture)
(<a name="8" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#8"> 18</a>);

<p>
3) the growth of the National Fascist Party, as marked
by its 1.7 million members on the march (<a name="9"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#9"> 19</a>);

<p>
4) the formation and growth of the Fascist Militia (Voluntary Militia for
National Security), the mechanism by means of which Mussolini brought
discipline to and regimented the most militant squadrist elements (<A
NAME="0" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#0"> 20</a>);

<b></b>

<p>
5) the nationwide proliferation of Fascist youth groups (Piccole
Italiane, Avanguardisti, Giovani Italiane, Balilla, GUF and ONB)
as a consecration of Fascism's glorious destiny (<a name="1"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#1"> 21</a>);

<p>
6) Fascism's success at bringing the working masses within the fold
of the state through its afterwork organizations and labor unions (<A
NAME="2" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#2"> 22</a>).

<p>
Here the narrative is drawn in conventional fashion. Fascism begins as
a small outlaw movement; its transformation into a mass movement hinges
upon Mussolini, the founder of the Party and of the various prolongations
that discipline outlaw Fascism and build a bridge between the Italian
populace and the Party and Militia, bearing fruit in the form of a fully
Fascistized mass society. In the process it descends from Milan to Rome
and then, from Rome, marches outwards towards the expanding border

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 268]</b>

of a renewed empire. A second sequence, dating from March 1941,
is more daring. It alternates pages filtered through the colors
that make up the Italian flag with crowd scenes and banner
headlines. It begins with a tricolor typographical composition,
cast in the usual romanized Futura typeface and preceded by a
title in block red caps: "IL DUCE'S SPEECH." (<a name="3"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#3"> 23</a>) Then follow:

<p>
1) a full-page black and white image of Mussolini facing the green/black
continuation of the transcript of the speech (<a name="4"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#4"> 24</a>);

<p>
2) two opposing green/black text pages with a vertical seam of an
abstracted mass bearing the tag "Naples," running between them (<A
NAME="5" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#5"> 25</a>);

<p>
3) a full-page red filtered crowd, tagged "Turin," juxtaposed with a
continuation of the same text in alternating green and black typefaces
(<a name="6" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#6"> 26</a>);

<p>
4) a "split-screen" photomontage of mass rallies: civilian rallies in
the lower portion, tagged Milan, Catania, Genoa and Bari; a military
rally in the two-panel panorama that spans the upper portion, tagged Rome
(<a name="7" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#7"> 27</a>);

<p>
5) a black and white full page made up of seven images (one,
tagged Bologna, running the full length of the page; the others
half-page) of mass rallies in various cities, juxtaposed with the
conclusion of the text in the form of a red banner headline reading
"VICTORY, ITALY, PEACE WITH JUSTICE AMONG PEOPLES" (<a name="8"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#8"> 28</a>).

<p>
The image of the masses binds the entire sequence together vertically
or horizontally, fluttering through the pages along with the colors of
the Italian flag and the transcription of a speech given by Mussolini in
Naples calling upon the populace to rise up and triumph against Italy's
enemies. Here the mass panorama is at once everywhere and nowhere. It
res both as an irreducible whole out of which radiate other

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 272]</b>

images of mass mobilization and as an autonomous graphic element that
can be "cited" as the synecdoche of a totality encompassing the dictator
and the nation. An orderly totality because the dictator's commanding
presence is predicated upon the no less commanding presence of the man
with a camera, airbrush, scissors, glue, inks and fonts. The latter shapes
individual frames in which voids have been systematically edited out so as
to evoke a perpetually mobilized nation state, a nation state bursting at
the seams with energy. He then freely weaves these individual frames into
a graphic environment that is saturated with words, statistics, colors
and images of surging revolutionary tides yet geometrically austere. All
this to create the illusion that, under Fascism, sublimity has become
an integral feature of everyday life. But a constructive and controlled
fact of life, reconcilable with the values of hierarchy and discipline.

<p>
Whether freestanding or not, mass panoramas are as much about unleashing
revolutionary tides as they are about stilling and channeling them,
as much about infinite oceans as about the absolute finitude of the
frame, the grid, the geometry of the page, the edit and cut. Politically
disciplined by the leader, the crowd is pictorially disciplined through
photomontage.

<p>
The growing importance of strategies of contextualization bespeaks the
impact of film upon contemporary graphics and photography, which is
to say, of a growing sense that mass panoramicists were still laboring
under too great restraints to their sublime art. The overlap between the
photographic and the cinematic is considerable, but lies beyond the scope
of this essay. So I would like to conclude instead with some reflections
upon the broader impact of the mass panorama within modernist graphic
culture and, then, with an analysis of one post-WWII spillover. What
interests me here is the emergence of and the ubiquity of abstracted
images of the masses as visual quotations: quotations of the very
"oceanic" conventions whose history has been retraced in the Italian
context; quotations that translate the oceanic mass back into abstract
geometrical emblems of a distinctive sort. Photomontage is often viewed
as a formal method rooted in abstractionism, at odds with the aims of
documentarism or reportage. But, as Margarita Tupitsyn has emphasized
in her work on Gustav Klutsis, photomontage also provided artists with
a powerful new instrument of mass persuasion based upon the manipulation
of social realia, from statistics to slogans to photographs, which helps
to explain why its path of development intersects that of the Italian
mass panorama.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Both are arts of imagistic and informational crowding in the name
 of crowd shaping and crowd control; both share the same agitatory
 ambitions, the same impatience with conventional forms of realism;
 the same desire to forge&#8212;whether in the metallurgical or
 counterfeiting sense--anticipatory images of society as it ought to be
 (but is not yet).

<p>
The degree to which, for present purposes, the Italian case may be
considered normative is, of course, an open question. Ideological
frameworks make a difference, though sometimes more of shading than of
substance. I have hinted all along at some

<b></b>

of the distinctively "Fascist" characteristics of the <i>Rivista
Illustrata</i> foldouts. A case history of Soviet mass iconography,
for instance, would have found a comparable panoramic imagination
at work in such images as El Lissitzky's <i>The Current is Switched
On</i>  or Rodchenko and Stepanova's <i>USSR in Construction</i>
photo-tableaux , the former woven into a sequence visually coupling
electrification with collectivization, the latter juxtaposing rallying
workers with textile patterns. But this imagination, in keeping with the
values of Communist internationalism, emphasizes abstract representations
of the crowd and/or the crowd's relation to industrial machinery, while
de-emphasizing place names, architectural settings, and images featuring
regional or historical particulars. It also tends to place such images,
constructed according to the same elevated orthogonal perspective as
their Fascist counterparts, more emphatically in dialogue with the
sorts of heroic ground-up diagonal perspective shots of worker heroes
that abound in the films of Dovchenko and Eisenstein. (Though the
latter left a powerful mark as well in Fascist and liberal-democratic
political art.) Likewise, a case history of American mass photography
would have found overlaps with Italian and Soviet practice (self-evident
in explicitly political works like Arthur Siegel's 1941 photograph "The
Right of Assembly"), but overlaps within a setting where what prevails
instead are compositions like Weegee's Coney Island suite built around a
foreground in which individuals are visible in all their particularity
as members of family or sentimental units. As in the crowd foldouts
featured on the pages of <i>Life</i> magazine, collectivization in North
America is typically associated with leisure activities or individual
self-betterment, less with nation building than with participation in the
secular religion of work rewarded by affluence and fun. Rather than the
loss of individuality in the oceanic multitude, American photomontages
tend to emphasize self-multiplication.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 Case studies of Nazi Germany, Getulio's Brazil, and Maoist China would
 have yielded additional convergences and divergences of a similar
 sort. Yet, for all these differences, what seems particularly striking
 are the continuities: technical/technological/graphic continuities
 and continuities also of a cultural-historical and perhaps even
 anthropological sort.

<p>
Certainly there can be no doubt that Italian industrial groups
knew exactly what it meant to "quote" the oceanic masses when they
placed ads in the <i>Rivista Illustrata</i>. A first example, from
Magneti Marelli, dates from June 1935 and reworks the conventions
that this essay has been analyzing. (. <a name="9"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#9">29</a> and <a name="0"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#0">30</a>) Explictly so because
it pries apart a circular inset and mass panorama from an earlier
photomontage celebrating the founding of the Italian national
radio, inserting under the leader, in the guise of his podium,
a massive amplifier, and between the inset and panorama, a bank of
loudspeakers whose power of amplification is revealed as the force
that binds together leader and mass. In a second advertisement,
published in March 1938 for the Pirelli tire company, the masses
have taken over the circular inset, recast as a wheel riding atop the
prolongation of the capital P in the name Pirelli. (<a name="1"
HREF="9.2schnapp_res.html#1"> 31</a>) Within the wheel and
resting upon them is the diagram of a factory hovering; looming behind
is a military star and a fasces composed of military, industrial,
and civilian vehicles&#8212;trucks, tractors, autos, airplanes, and
motorcycles&#8212;all shod with Pirelli tires. The composition

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 275]</b>

is geometrical but to designate it as such is not to say that it is
contentless, neutral, or purely ornamental, for the star, the fasces,
and the circle of workers re as emblems of a Fascist modernity
defined by national mobilization and accelerated movement. This
suggests that worker circles are ultimately no less emblematic than
are Arthur Mole's living clocks, it is simply that they function
within a context where traditional symbols have lost their value
unless, like the fasces, they have been infused with industrial
content. But what then of images such as Moholy-Nagy's 1930 photomontage
<i>Verantworte!</i> (or "Be Responsible!") in which the masses are
transformed into panoramic decorative stripes? (<a name="2"
href="9.2schnapp_res.html#2"> 32</a>) A recent catalogue
description notes with respect to <i>Verantworte!</i> that "the crowd
scenes suggest demonstrations; the woman's mouth may represent the
importance of speaking out, although it appears oddly glamorous." The
montage is "a call to action, although the cause is not yet identified."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 Far from standing for a desire to speak out, the "oddly glamorous"
 female visage is spliced into the oceanic mass so as to posit a
 fundamental equivalency. Both are volatile objects of modern masculine
 desires; both are to be approached with a mix of anticipation and
 anxiety, i.e. cautiously. Italian advertisements for 78 rpm recordings
 of Mussolini's speeches rehearse a similar graphic convention. The
 leader's word radiates outward from his body at once shaping the
 masses into concentric rings and piercing these very rings along
 a diagonal vector anchored in the doubly ringed title DUCE. Is the
 latter a microphone rising up from his podium or a second upraised
 fist? Or is it the switch by means of which the crowd's electrical
 current is turned on or the lever driving the engines that drive the
 ship of state? Little does it matter. The oceanic mass

<b></b>

seduces and thrills, and in so doing, poses a threat to individuality; but
its blandishments may be at once accepted and overcome through recourse
to geometrical discipline. Moholy's call to action may well be far more
cautionary than the call issued by the Italian state record company to
purchase copies of Mussolini's electrifying speeches, but, cautionary or
not, it remains illegible outside of the framework of the mass panorama.

<p>
The final word (or, rather, visual gesture) will have to go to Andy
Warhol, whose work from the early 1960s both traffics in mass panoramic
imagery and lays bare the latter's central graphic trope. Only a decade
away from what may perhaps rightly be viewed as the beginning of the end
of Le Bon's era of crowds, Warhol found in contemporary mass politics,
particularly as refracted through the rose-tinted lens of Communist
Chinese propaganda, the mirror image of the society of spectacle that he
was already celebrating in his serial images of Hollywood celebrities. So
to his serial portraits of Marilyn he added his own contribution to the
lineage of mass panoramas that the present essay has retraced. Entitled
<i>The Crowd</i>, these pictures tap into the same image bank of throwaway
press photos on which Warhol relied for the "Death in America" series. (<A
NAME="3" href="9.2schnapp_res.html#3"> 33</a>) Like
their car crash counterparts they refer to temporally dislocated events,
current events whose currency is at once obvious and in doubt: "obvious"
because, at first glance they might seem to refer to contemporary mass
protest movements&#8212;1963 was the year of Martin Luther King's March
on Washington; "in doubt" because, strictly speaking, they do not.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 (The ambiguity is telling inasmuch as Warhol's 1963&#8212;1964 "Race
 Riot" series, on the contrary, is based on "fresh" photojournalistic
 sources.)

<b></b>

<p>
<i>The Crowd</i> exists in two versions from 1963. Both appear to have
been elaborated in tandem with the <i>Thirteen Most Wanted Men</i>
panels for the New York State pavilion of the 1964 New York World's Fair
(censored by the pavilion overseers). Both derive from a single UPI source
photo, dated 4 November, 1955, on the back of which Warhol penciled in a
sketch of a woman's face. The photograph bore the legend: "Rome. Saint
Peter and the Crowd: The huge statue of Saint Peter seems to look down
benignly upon the crowd in Saint Peter's Square that gathered to hear
the Pope's blessing on Easter Sunday. It was impossible to estimate the
tremendous throng accurately, but

<b></b>

guesses range from 300,000 to 500,000."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 No trace of Peter or the Pope carries over into the Pop version of
 Mole's Christian Catholic multitudes (though a minute inspection reveals
 recurring clusters of priests and nuns). Rather, the works assume the
 form of large and grainy silk-screen prints of abstracted masses, built
 up, like the star and crash images, out of a single visual block that
 is repeated, shifted right or left, flipped on its head and cropped.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 The resulting scene might well have been oceanic were it not for
 the fact that here the tiles have come apart. The seams are showing
 and are crudely "covered up" by pencil marks. The repetitions are
 rudimentary. The squares have come unhinged (as has the implicit
 photojournalistic pact that links live events to their timely
 representation). The overall texture of the photographic image has
 become clotted as if printed on a sheet of tawdry newsprint. All of
 which makes any potential sense of vastness, power and sublimity seem
 more than a little dated, more than little trumped up.

<p>
<i>The Crowd</i> was crafted as a hundred thousand voices of patience,
pain, and anger echoed through the streets of Washington, with those
of anti-Vietnam war protesters soon to follow. Yet the Pope of Pop
anticipated the coming of an era in which Le Bon's volatile chemistry
would cease to work: an era in which, in national settings where
modernization has run its full course, a model of politics based upon
the physical massing of bodies in public places or the performance of
symbolic marches in real time and space would begin to be superceded by a
politics of gestures that relies upon virtual, indirect, and asynchronous
forms of presence, organization, and participation. The discontinuity
is, of course, a matter of emphasis. All modes of political action,
from negotiation to symbolic actions (including strikes and mass
demonstrations) to acts of collective violence are fated to remain
synchronous. Just as handwriting continued as a key instrument of
communication under the regime of typewriting and just as typewriting now
continues to play a role under the regime of digital writing and printing,
a fundamental simultaneity is to be expected. Where Warhol's intuition,
however, proves indicative is that, just as handwritten documents
look fundamentally <i>different</i> and function in a fundamentally
<i>different</i> way within a setting where machine writing is the
norm, so the once heroic image of the oceanic crowd now flickers live on
television screens under a growing patina of anachronism. (An anachronism
consciously embraced by mass choreographies like the Million Man March
that seek to repeat and, by means of repetition, to appropriate the image
of the civil rights marches of the 1960s.) With their power and prestige
mostly restricted to the domains of entertainment, sports and mediatized
religion, the multicolored and polyphonic tidal waves of revolution in
modern capitals now loom at a certain distance, as if brought back to
life from earlier phases in history, as if material from the now sealed
vault of modernity. The era of crowds is still very much with us. But,
in a deeper sense, perhaps it has passed.

Dowie makes a cameo appearance in the Circe section of James Joyce's
<i>Ulysses</i>, where he inveighs against Bloom: "Fellowchristians and
antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace
to Christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this
stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery
recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This
vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the
Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath
of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for
him." James Joyce, <i>Ulysses</i> (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1969), 463-64.

The city plan was, much like Mole's photographs, symbolic. It radiated
outwards from the site of the tabernacle and its streets bore names

<p>
In early 1920, T. S. Eliot sent his brother Henry a copy of his new book, <i>Ara Vos Prec,</i> just published in a limited edition. These poems, he told his brother, are "intensely serious, . . . among the best I have ever done." But they would not, he feared, be well received, especially by his mother. "I have not sent this to Mother or told her about it. . . . Do you think that 'Sweeney Erect' will shock her?"
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  We do not know what Eliot's mother thought of "Sweeney Erect," but we do know that readers over the years have considered the poems in <i>Ara Vos Prec</i> to be both puzzling and disturbing. Some, perhaps like Eliot's mother, have found them embarrassing; others have agreed with Eliot that they are among his best. But whether or not they are among his best, they are clearly brilliant specimens of modernism in their marriage of experimental form and shocking content.

<p>
The critics who have taken the <i>Ara Vos Prec</i> poems most seriously fall into two categories, emphasizing either impersonal qualities related to form or personal qualities related to content. The former tend to connect these poems to the critical theories Eliot was working through at the same time&#8212;the historical sense, impersonality, tradition&#8212;all elaborated in his 1920 collection, <i>The Sacred Wood</i>. The second strain of criticism, emerging somewhat later, tends to focus on the poems as personal expressions of the poet's alleged prejudices against women and Jews. The older critics are inclined to neglect intersections of art with life, whereas more recent critics often neglect literary elements, such as structural framing, tone, and point of view, that shape meaning.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 



<b></b>

<p>
The interpretation presented in this paper owes something to critics from both camps, but most to William Arrowsmith, whose discussion of the classical backgrounds of the Sweeney poems is superb.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  My thesis is that these poems portray violence and desire as reciprocally and mimetically related and that they emerged largely from the convergence of two powerful elements in Eliot's own life. The first, World War I, was public and impersonal; the other, the poet's marriage in 1915 to Vivienne Haigh-Wood, was private and intensely personal. In the normal course of events, war would be associated with violence and marriage with desire. In wartime London (and Paris and Berlin), however, violence reached into every corner of civilian life, coloring and intensifying all aspects of personal life, including the sexual. In Eliot's case, the result of this convergence can be found in the Sweeney poems, written between 1917 and 1919, during the first few years of his troubled marriage and during or immediately following the war. The war, virtually unnoted in criticism of these poems, is a powerful influence, for it provides the background of violence and desire against which both his personal life and his understanding of culture took shape. Eliot's marriage <i>per se</i> is less important for this essay than the related issue of sexuality and its entanglement in violence. In support of my thesis, I will offer an analysis of "Sweeney Erect," the poem Eliot did not want his mother to see.

<p>
The theoretical backdrop for the following discussion is Ren&eacute; Girard's work on violence and desire. In <i>Deceit, Desire, and the Novel</i>  and several subsequent books, including <i>Violence and the Sacred</i> , Girard maintains that violence originates in mimetic desire. His basic insight is that what makes an object desirable is related less to its inherent value than to the fact that it is considered desirable by someone else. Desire is not spontaneous and original; it is mediated and copied. One tends to desire what others desire, to value what others value. Desire is thus triangular, with invisible lines connecting a subject, an object, and someone else whose desires are imitated. Girard claims that the mediator is a key to understanding violence and culture. He is perceived by the subject not as a mediator, but as a rival, as someone who desires the same object and thus blocks access to it. This perceived interference feeds on itself and leads to violence. The idea that desire is acquisitive is not new, but the idea that it is mimetic is new and helpful in explaining the mechanism of both violence and desire. In <i>Violence and the Sacred,</i> Girard explores the reciprocity involved in violence, showing how it spreads and accelerates toward a crisis, and finally, how it is checked. He argues that individual violence tends to repeat itself unless it is assuaged by collective violence. Girard's overall thesis is perfectly illustrated by war, which always involves mimetic desire, rivalry, enemy brothers, scapegoats, and collective violence.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 

<p>
The point in Girard's theory that is most relevant to my argument regarding the convergence of violence and desire in the Sweeney poems is the claim that sexuality and violence are closely related in all cultures and religions, and further, that in some instances, they are interchangeable. The connections, in fact, are many and for the most part self-evident:  both sexual excitement and violent aggression are based on mimetic desire;  both trigger almost identical biochemical changes;  both involve 
<b></b>
temporary loss or suspension of rational faculties;  both involve shedding of blood;  once triggered, both tend to accelerate toward explosive bursts of energy;  both tend to take on a life of their own apart from the object;  both tend to accept surrogates if the object of desire is inaccessible;  both are highly contagious; and  both can result in injury or death, as in war or childbirth. Violence and sexuality, he concludes, are mimetically related and separated by the thinnest of lines. "The shift from violence to sexuality, then, and from sexuality to violence is easily effected, even by the most 'normal' of individuals, totally lacking in perversion."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  Girard's notion of desire is consistent with the view of sociologists such as William Simon, who argue that sex is never just about sex, but always includes something happening at an angle offstage and often involves violence.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  The offstage (or off-page) drama of acquisitive violence relevant to the Sweeney poems, I suggest, was the bloody struggle centered just across the English Channel, the effects of which dominated London life for many years, beginning in August 1914.

<p>
The association of sexuality and violence, a signature feature of the Sweeney poems, is evident in Eliot's early poetic notebook, both in the bawdy limericks he shared with his male friends and in the striking inscriptions of religious ecstasy and sexual violence.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  His tendency to connect sexuality and violence was cinched by his marriage in June 1915. From the very beginning, he linked sex with the spilling of blood, an association that can be seen in his little-known honeymoon poem, "Ode."

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When the bridegroom smoothed his hair

<br />
There was blood upon the bed.

<br />
Morning was already late.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

 

<p>
Eliot's bride had a problem with abnormal vaginal bleeding, a condition that he did not discover until after their marriage. Their sheets were often bloody, and understandably, he felt directly implicated. Another reason Eliot would have associated sexuality with violence is that in addition to her "female" trouble, his wife was constantly ill with a nervous condition that at times verged on madness. The association of sexuality with violence, and of both with madness, as Girard points out, is not unusual, especially in creative writers. In fact, it is made repeatedly in the work of two of Eliot's favorite writers, Dostoevsky and Baudelaire. Their work is a reminder of how close sexual activity is to violence and to madness, and of how in the minds of many people, one of the thrills of sex is its proximity to violence. Making love is akin to murder, to doing a girl in, as a later incarnation of Eliot's Sweeney puts it.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 

<p>
The two Sweeney poems&#8212;"Sweeney Erect" and "Sweeney Among the Nightingales"&#8212;were written soon after Eliot's marriage, and both betray profound sexual anxiety. But of equal or greater importance is the fact that they were written in the third and fourth years of the Great War. Sexual violence in these poems is inseparable from a much more comprehensive violence, one seldom mentioned in Eliot studies&#8212;that is, the everyday violence of living in wartime London. A close reading of his letters, correlated with current events, indicates that it was not so much blood on the bed as 
<b></b>
blood all around that impressed Eliot from 1915-18. If Girard's thesis is valid, the two cannot be fully separated. Violence in the public and private arenas are in subtle ways reciprocally and mimetically related. In addition, violence has an indelible effect on intellectual and imaginative life, shaping one's understanding of human nature, forcing reflection on the human propensity to wound and destroy, and shaping one's fantasies (particularly sexual ones).

<p>
The beginning of Eliot's residence in Europe coincides exactly with the beginning of the war. He arrived as a student at the University of Marburg in July 1914; on 1 August, Germany declared war on Russia, and on 4 August, England declared war on Germany. Forced to flee from Germany, he spent the fall of 1914 and the spring of 1915 at Oxford. He was deeply disturbed by the unfolding events and desperately worried about friends on the battlefield, including Jean Verdenal, who was ting on the Western Front. In the spring Verdenal was sent to the Dardanelles, where he was killed in May&#8212;"mixed with the mud of Gallipoli."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  In mid-June of 1915, at the end of Oxford's Trinity Term, Eliot moved to London. One week later, after a courtship lasting less than two months, he married Vivienne Haigh-Wood, and thenceforth, he lived in London. The war had been under way for almost a year, and it had already plunged London into deep crisis.

<p>
First, from 1915 until the end of the war, London with her groaning multitudes was under aerial bombardment. Peter Strasser, the commander of the Zeppelin fleets in charge of bombing London, "was bothered by the moral implications of raids" on civilians, but rationalized that there was no such thing as a noncombatant. Because civilians in London provided the food and the machinery to support the troops, they were deemed a necessary target. "It was all part of total war . . . war on entire populations."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  On the night of 2-3 September 1916, one of the most spectacular episodes of the entire air war occurred over London. Over five hundred bombs were dropped in an arc around London, and a German airship was shot down over the city, its flaming wreckage seen by hundreds of thousands of witnesses (<i>GW,</i> 132). At the time, Eliot and Vivienne were on holiday in Bosham, a fishing village near Portsmouth, but two days later, on 5 September, he returned to London alone to work at the British Museum. That evening, he wrote to his cousin Eleanor Hinkley. He did not mention the attack on London, but concluded by saying, "Remember that this and all letters are read by the censors" (<i>L,</i> 147-8). The next evening, he wrote to his mother and brother, again not mentioning the devastation in London, but confiding in the letter to Henry that "the present year has been . . . the most awful nightmare of anxiety that the mind of man could conceive, but at least it is not dull" (<i>L,</i> 151). Some six months later in March 1917, Peter Strasser's Zeppelin was shot down over London, and he was killed. On 21 March, Eliot wrote to his sister, "the war has at least brought <i>variety</i> into our lives," but that "political topics are barred in letters; . . . a great annoyance to me, as I am violently interested in the subject at present. . . ." (<i>L,</i> 165). In July 1917, in a letter to his cousin Eleanor, Eliot did allow one reference to the bombs to enter his letters. He had been working in Lloyd's Bank since March, and he describes his experience:



<b></b>

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I have been living in one of Dostoevsky's novels, you see, not in one of Jane Austen's. If I have not seen the battle field, I have seen other strange things, and I have signed a cheque for two hundred thousand pounds while bombs fell all about me. . . . it all seems like a dream. [<i>L,</i> 189]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
To be a character in a novel by Dostoevsky would be to live in a world of violence, terror, perversity, madness, and anxiety, the world of such works as <i>Crime and Punishment</i> or <i>Notes from Underground.</i>

<p>
A second way that the war impacted Londoners can be seen in their relationships with soldiers who were home on leave. Eliot knew many men who returned to London for rest leaves and often refers to his terrifying conversations with them. His most frequent visitor from the Front was Vivienne's young brother Maurice. In November 1915, Maurice came home for a brief rest, part of it spent with Tom and Vivienne. Tom described the visit in a letter to his mother:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Maurice was home for five days leave this week . . . It seems very strange that a boy of nineteen should have such experiences&#8212;often twelve hours alone in his "dug-out" in the trenches, and at night, when he cannot sleep, occupying himself by shooting rats with a revolver. What he tells about rats and vermin is incredible&#8212;Northern France is swarming, and the rats are as big as cats. His "dug-out," where he sleeps, is underground and gets no sunlight. [<i>L,</i> 121]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Maurice is mentioned repeatedly in the wartime letters, with affection and respect. He was invalided at home for insomnia in August 1916 and spent several days at Bosham boating with Tom and Vivienne. Tom wrote to his cousin Eleanor that Maurice

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
looks nearer twenty-five than twenty. He is thoroughly WORN OUT and from some of the horrors which he once entertained us with, I am not surprised. A boy of nineteen (for he had his twentieth birthday with us) who is quite used to the sight of <i>disjecta membra</i> and has spent nights . . . in shooting rats with a revolver, makes me feel comparatively immature. [<i>L,</i> 147]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
These horrific accounts by soldiers unmasked the rosy picture painted by the generals and politicians. In 1917, Eliot wrote to his father: "I see the war partly through the eyes of men who have been and returned, and who view it, even when convinced of the rightness of the cause . . . as something very sordid and disagreeable, which must be lived through" (<i>L,</i> 183).

<p>
1916 was a bleak year for Europe. In January, Eliot wrote Conrad Aiken with the news that Verdenal had been killed, adding, "we are very blue about the war" (<i>L,</i> 125). In February, one of the most gruesome battles in military history began near Verdun. This battle of attrition lasted the rest of the year, with over a million French and German casualties. On 1 July 1916, the equivalent disaster for England commenced with the Battle of the Somme. Over a million men were killed, with 60,000 British casualties on the first day alone, the worst day in British military history. There were over 5,000 London casualties on that first day.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  A documentary of the Battle of the Somme 
<b></b>
was shown in London. It was the first time civilians had actually seen what was happening, and many ran from the theatre screaming (<i>GW,</i> 187-8). Winter and Baggett claim that even today, Britain has not recovered from the first day of the Battle of the Somme. They argue that 1 July 1916 was the "point at which the illusions of one century gave way to the realism of another" (<i>GW,</i> 195).

<p>
The red horse of war is always followed by the pale horse of death. In 1918, an influenza epidemic swept the world, killing over twenty million people, more than twice as many as were killed in the war (<i>GW,</i> 314). Both Eliot and his wife had influenza for most of 1918, and in July, he wrote to his mother, "We have been living on quietly and trying to escape the 'Spanish influenza,' so called. A good many men&#8212;and women&#8212;have been away from the office with that curious malady" (<i>L,</i> 237). By November and December, both Eliots were gravely ill. The war had been going on for four years, and as Tom had indicated to his brother, they were living in a nightmare (<i>L,</i> 172). When Eliot began work on the Sweeney poems, he was at his lowest point&#8212;physically, psychologically, and spiritually.

<p>
To illustrate the convergence of violence and desire in the poems Eliot wrote during the war, I now turn to a reading of "Sweeney Erect," arguably the most disturbing poem in his 1920 collection. It is not immediately clear what is going on in this poem, but it is clear that violence is in the air. There are jackknives, razors, sickles&#8212;all tools designed for legitimate purposes, but also instruments used in torture and murder. And the verbs&#8212;slitted, gashed, cropped&#8212;point to slaughter, rather than shaving or farming. Moreover, the responses&#8212;shrieking, clawing, clutching one's sides&#8212;are consistent with having been attacked or wounded. The ominous mood is underscored and the tension heightened by ambiguity. Is this poem about sex or is it about murder? To consider this question is to enter the labyrinth of reading, or in Gerontion's phrase, a "wilderness of mirrors."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 

<p>
Structurally, "Sweeney Erect" is complex, a palimpsest of cultural and temporal layers. It consists of two parts, each with its own voice, its own scene and characters, and its own tone. The epigraph and first two quatrains project a desperate and presumably female voice beseeching an artist to create a desolate landscape; the remaining nine quatrains present a presumably male voice narrating the story of a man finishing up his business in a whorehouse. The first part is related primarily to the visual arts and tends to be static, while the second is related to narrative and tends to be dynamic; the first part suggests prehistory, while the second suggests contemporary history. The voice in the first part cries out from within her story, appealing to the reader, while the voice in the second belongs to an observer who stands outside the story and comments on it parenthetically in an aside to the reader.

<p>
A first step in understanding the poem is to decode the action of the second part, that part containing the Sweeney narrative, and beginning in the third quatrain. The curtain opens on Sweeney and a prostitute in bed, their feet and hands protruding from beneath the sheets. The morning light wakes them, and Sweeney begins to emerge, his prehensile arms suggestive of an orangutan's. The association of Sweeney with an ape is a clear signal that he is a caricature, the signature of which is the exaggeration of a physical characteristic such as a crooked nose or a squinting eye in order to make a 
<b></b>
point. In this instance, the exaggerated characteristic is human kinship with the lower animals&#8212;more specifically, with the anthropoid ape closest to humans in the evolutionary scale. To understand even the literal meaning of the poem, one must recognize that the characters are caricatures. Sweeney straddles the human and the subhuman, his spiritual qualities obscured and his lower, material qualities accented.

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
This withered root of knots of hair

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Slitted below and gashed with eyes,

<br />
This oval O cropped out with teeth:
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
These lines describe, among other things, the face the yawning Sweeney will see when he looks in the mirror: hairy, bestial, his mouth a slit, his eyes gashes. The teeth are a reminder that he is not only carnivorous but cannibalistic, associated in this poem with Polyphemus, the Cyclops who eats Odysseus's sailors, and with the Minotaur, who consumes fourteen young Athenians each year. In a reincarnation of Sweeney a decade later, Eliot will underscore the connection between violence and sexuality by merging cannibalism and sexual desire: "Yes I'd eat you!" Sweeney will say to Doris in <i>Sweeney Agonistes.</i>
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  This sort of caricature, incidently, was rampant during the war. Images of the enemy as orangutans appeared not only on recruiting posters, but in cartoons, commercial advertising, popular culture, and even in sermons (<i>GW,</i> 94).

<p>
Sweeney not only looks like an ape; he acts like one. Some of the most shocking lines in the poem describe him getting out of bed:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The sickle motion from the thighs

<p>
Jackknifes upward at the knees

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then straightens out from heel to hip

<br />
Pushing the framework of the bed

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And clawing at the pillow slip.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
A jackknife is a large pocketknife; in the context of a brutish man visiting a prostitute, it becomes a nightmarish phallic image. Still, though the image casts a long shadow over Sweeney's sexual performance and the pain he is capable of inflicting, the word "jackknife" is here used as a verb to describe his motion in getting up. A "jackknife" is a dive in which the diver bends sharply in midair to touch his toes and then briskly straightens out before entering the water. It also refers to a sit-up, in which the diving maneuver is preceded by a sudden contraction of the knees. This is an energetic way to move from a prone to an erect position, but within the range of normal, especially for athletes or adolescents.

<p>
Sweeney is more complex, however, than the caricature would suggest, for he is an ape who stands erect and looks in a mirror and shaves and generalizes about the female temperament. Looking in the mirror, he sees the human face behind the knots of hair, and he prepares to remove the facial hair that is the mark of the beast. As he wipes the suds about his face, his recumbent friend shrieks, and he pauses&#8212;both to 
<b></b>
allow the shriek to subside and to allow the narrator to toss in an aside for the reader&#8212;and then he tests the razor on his leg, at which point the prostitute curves backward and clutches her sides. She is as much a caricature as is Sweeney. Her response to Sweeney's antics is described ambiguously as a shriek, her convulsive behavior as an epileptic fit. Where is the poem's sympathy in this episode; with Sweeney, as some critics assume, or with the prostitute? It is difficult, in fact, to sympathize with either, for any sympathy that might be elicited by the situation is neutralized by the technique. Caricature defeats sympathy; indeed that is one of the main reasons for using it.

<p>
The cause of the shriek (amusement? pain? anger? illness?) is ambiguous, but the result is clear&#8212;it disturbs the other women in the house. In the two quatrains describing their response to the ruckus, Eliot moves from caricature to irony. One might think that women in this profession were beyond blushing, but no, these are "ladies," they have their principles, and they are fearful lest Sweeney's behavior reflect on them. Doris's hysteria, after all, might be misinterpreted by other customers. Mrs. Turner, the madam, agrees that such behavior "does the house no sort of good." Meanwhile, Doris seems to have composed herself and taken a bath; she returns wrapped only in a towel, bringing liquid refreshment.

<p>
The Sweeney narrative assaults the reader with the fact of violence in a context that links it to sexuality. What are the roots of such violence, and how are they related to gender? Important clues are given in three allusions. The first two are to American classics, Emerson's "Self-Reliance" and Poe's "Murders in the Rue Morgue," and the third is to Ovid's <i>Metamorphosis.</i> Altogether, these allusions provide a commentary on violence and human nature in the context of evolution. The Emerson allusion is arguably the most important. Eliot re-read Emerson in 1916 and 1917 for his adult education course, writing to his mother in early 1917 that he was immersed in Emerson (<i>EDA,</i> 41; <i>L,</i> 196). Beginning work on the Sweeney poems at the same time, he found his fellow American's ideas useful as a reference point for commenting on human nature as he was getting to know it in his marriage and in war-ravaged London.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The most explicit use of Emerson appears in "Sweeney Erect."

<p>
Roughly in the middle of the Sweeney plot, the narrator interrupts his story to comment parenthetically on Emerson's philosophy of history. He refers to the American sage by name and loosely quotes from his most famous essay, "Self-Reliance."

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
(The lengthened shadow of a man

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Is history, said Emerson

<br />
Who had not seen the silhouette

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Of Sweeney straddled in the sun.)
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Emerson believed in moral evolution. People, he argued, were not only becoming stronger; they were becoming better. He maintained that individuals could make a difference in their own evolution. If they were slothful, they would slide backward toward the beasts; if they were self-reliant and energetic, they would move upward toward the angels. The quintessential American optimist, Emerson believed that one could make oneself into an exceptional individual, someone who could shape history. 
<b></b>
He defined history, in fact, as little more than the cumulative record of the works of superior individuals:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; . . . A Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so . . . cleave to his genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possibility of man. . . . An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; . . . all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Emerson concludes this famous essay by saying that only the self-reliant individual truly "stands in the erect position."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Eliot's paraphrase condenses but does not misrepresent Emerson's view. "Sweeney Erect" is above all an ironic commentary on Emerson's view of human nature and history. In 1917, three years into a seemingly never-ending war, the belief in man's innate nobility can only be described as touchingly naive. The contrast between Emerson and Eliot can be seen in their respective uses of the adjective "erect" to describe human beings. Emerson's pun points to those qualities that differentiate the human from the subhuman. Being <i>homo erectus,</i> standing in the "erect position," means being spiritually strong, morally straight. Eliot's pun, conversely, points not to what differentiates man from the orangutan, but to what binds him to the apes&#8212;sexual aggression and a propensity towards violence. Similarly, Eliot's poem subverts the great man theory of history. As he endured the nightmare of life in a bombarded city, Eliot came to see history as the lengthened shadow, not of Caesar or Christ, but of Sweeney. "At the bottom of man's heart there is always the beast," he remarked in a 1916 review.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 

<p>
In "Sweeney Erect" the Emersonian understanding of human nature and history is subverted by two allusions that give a more realistic assessment of the roots of violence. The most striking detail in Eliot's poem, the image of an orangutan shaving before a mirror, is taken from Edgar Allan Poe's justly celebrated "Murders in the Rue Morgue." In this story, a French sailor captures an orangutan in the jungles of Borneo, brings it home to Paris, and hides it in his wardrobe. One evening the sailor comes home and discovers that the orangutan has escaped. He finds it standing straight up before the mirror, razor in hand, trying to shave. Seeing the ape holding a dangerous implement, the sailor reaches for the whip. The terrified beast leaps out of the room and enters the apartment of an old woman and her daughter. The women shriek with horror, and the ape grabs the old woman by the hair with such force that he yanks off part of her scalp, after which he decapitates her with the razor and tosses her out the window. He then kills the daughter, stuffs her up a chimney, and runs away.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 

<p>
This story, like many of Poe's supernatural tales, draws on the most primitive memories of the human psyche. He is dealing, of course, with suppressed violence, with the beast concealed in the center of civilization. And he is dealing with the nature of violence&#8212;its explosive power, especially when it has been suppressed; its tendency to accelerate once it has been triggered; its willingness to accept substitutes if it cannot turn on its true object (in this case, its willingness to attack the defenseless women, instead of the sailor armed with the whip); its unwillingness to stop until it has been 
<b></b>
appeased. Poe is also dealing with the connection between violence and mimetic desire (the ape's desires are imitations of the sailor's), and with the role of fear in triggering violence. It is a shocking story, for many reasons, but as Arrowsmith has remarked, what gives the story its effect of moral shock is the single detail that the orangutan is shaving when his murderous rampage is triggered: "The moral element lies in that ambivalent razor, at once an implement of civilizing adornment and of murder" ("PP," 28-9). By forcing our attention on the image of the orangutan shaving, and having the ape pause and then reverse directions, Poe presents a snapshot of man on the very cusp of evolution, teetering between his capacity for violence and his capacity to prepare a face to meet the faces that he meets. The shaving orangutan seems to be attempting to evolve upward, to become human, to become erect in the anthropological sense. When surprised by the sailor, the ape is studying his own face in the mirror; he is, in brief, becoming self-conscious. In this snapshot, the orangutan, like the far more attractive Lord Jim, can be seen as "one of us."

<p>
In "Sweeney Erect," the hero is superimposed on Poe's orangutan. Sweeney too has a razor and an undoubted capacity for violence, but he also has a capacity for restraint. Both like and unlike Poe's orangutan, Sweeney is a <i>homo duplex</i>&#8212;capable of violence and of culture, of spiraling downward or stretching upward. Seeing his own face in the mirror, he becomes not only self-conscious, but conscious of being human. Shaving off his facial hair, he shows a capacity for transcending his bestiality. Using soap, he demonstrates the ability to cleanse himself.

<p>
The allusion to "Murders in the Rue Morgue" is paralleled by a fascinating allusion to Ovid's <i>Metamorphosis.</i> In the third quatrain of "Sweeney Erect," Eliot compares his hero to Polyphemus. The Cyclops is best known, of course, from the <i>Odyssey,</i> but as Arrowsmith has pointed out, that is not Eliot's main referent here ("PP," 36-7). His Polyphemus comes from Ovid's story of Galatea. This tale, known to English students through its use in pastorals such as Marlowe's "Come live with me and be my love," tells of the sea-nymph Galatea, beloved of a shepherd, whom she loves in return, but also beloved of Polyphemus, whom she hates. In the following lines, Galatea tells how "love" has transformed the Cyclops, causing him to look at his reflection in a pool and shave off his facial hair.

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
That savage [Polyphemus], whom the very forest trembles

<br />

</blockquote>

<p>

The issues of self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and self-love present in so many mirror scenes are clearly present here. This Cyclops with razor and mirror is another of Sweeney's avatars, another murderous beast on the cusp of evolution.

<p>
The allusions to Poe and Ovid point to textbook examples of Girard's theory of mimetic desire accelerating toward violence and also to his idea that sexuality and violence are interrelated. In Poe, the violence is horrendous, and the victims are women. This confluence insures that the tapestry before which his narrative develops will have threads connecting sexuality and violence. In the narrative itself, however, the women are accidental victims. The primary object of the ape's rampage is the sailor, but the sailor has a whip, and so the ape discharges his rage on surrogates. The woman are targets of opportunity, chosen because they are physically weak and have no weapons with which to counterattack. In Poe, the orangutan seems to represent a secret sharer, a capacity for murder residual in <i>homo erectus,</i> male and female. The root of violence in Ovid, similarly, appears to be related primarily to mimetic desire and the state of nature. In Ovid, charmingly, and in Eliot, ominously, violence is connected to metamorphosis. In both Ovid and Eliot, the metamorphosis involves the line separating nature from culture, the bestial from the human.

<p>
Eliot's Sweeney is the lengthened shadow of his avatars, especially of Ovid's Polyphemus and Poe's orangutan. At the same time, he is more complicated than either. If Emerson describes <i>homo erectus,</i> and Poe and Ovid present <i>homo duplex,</i> then Eliot creates <i>homo multiplex.</i> His narrative is labyrinthine, with alternative readings jostling for attention. These alternative readings are clearly intentional; indeed the bedrock ambiguity is part of the meaning. The alternatives support the conviction, evident in all layers of the poem, that humans, both as a species and as individuals, are on a pivot point between a downward spiral into violence and an upward step into culture.

<p>
The ambiguities begin with the title itself. The pun on "erect"&#8212;Sweeney's status as human, as <i>homo erectus,</i> and also his sexual erection&#8212;suggests the tension between intellect and instinct that for Eliot is distinctive of the human. The issue is complicated by the fact that instinct is associated not only with brutality, but also with sexuality and the life force. In fact, Sweeney's erection is a visual reminder of well-known statues of Greek fertility res with oversized fully erect phalluses, res at once frightening and life-affirming. Intellect, similarly, is darkly ambiguous. It not only points toward progress, but toward violence. The unprecedented violence of Verdun and the Somme, after all, originated in "Ideas" and was managed by the intellectual elite&#8212;in other words, by politicians and generals.

<p>
The ambiguity of the title is multiplied in the narrative, as will be evident to anyone familiar with the poem's criticism. Lyndall Gordon, for example, suggests quite a different narrative from the one outlined earlier in this essay. While I suggest that the quatrain beginning with "This withered root of knots of hair" describes the face Sweeney must confront in the mirror, Gordon reads this quatrain as a description of the woman in bed with Sweeney. "A prostitute is reduced to a set of slits&#8212;'Slitted below and gashed with eyes'"(<i>IL,</i> 105). I agree that the ambiguous description could apply to the 
<b></b>
prostitute, and even concede that it is suggestive not only of a face but of female genitalia, but I don't agree that the image applies exclusively or primarily to the prostitute. The focus is on Sweeney, which suggests minimally that the description be tested on him first; when so tested, it not only fits, but clearly anticipates his interest in shaving. Ignoring Sweeney here is ignoring the point of view. The more general point is crucial: Eliot routinely uses language that allows (almost forces) a spillover effect; in this case, he describes Sweeney's face in language that cannot help but spill over to the prostitute. The difference in this reading and Gordon's has consequences, for it is her claim that the description refers to the prostitute that enables her to see this quatrain as evidence of "the poet's hatred of women's sexuality" (ibid). The alternative reading&#8212;that the narrator is describing both Sweeney and the woman on the bed&#8212;allows for greater complexity in that it takes into consideration the nature of men and women individually and in relation to each other, both socially and sexually.

<p>
Similarly, what I read as a representation of Sweeney getting up, Gordon reads as a representation of him having sex. "The 'sickle motion of the thighs'&#8212;all there is to sex&#8212;turns into the alarming jerk of an epileptic fit" (ibid). She is not pulling this out of a hat, of course, for the text allows this interpretation by superimposing a jackknife sit-up on both sex and an epileptic fit. But again I would argue that the primary and most literally coherent reading is of a man getting up, with spillover readings suggesting sexual intercourse and epilepsy. If the passage is primarily a description of sex, then the woman is being tortured. If it is a representation of a jackknife sit-up, with clear pointers toward a brutal sexual performance, then the subject changes from what Sweeney <i>is doing</i> to the prostitute to what he <i>is capable of doing,</i> and by extension, to what human beings are capable of doing to each other.

<p>
I would also take issue with Gordon's idea that Sweeney is Eliot's surrogate in any narrow sense. Sweeney is a symbol, an idea, an image of man as he has evolved. Eliot is also a man, and thus it goes without saying that Eliot is Sweeney. But the reader is also Sweeney. "<i>Hypocrite lecteur!&#8212;Mon semblable,&#8212;mon fr&egrave;re</i>!"
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  The poem is not to any appreciable extent self-portraiture or even self-caricature; it is an analysis of violence and human nature that exploits ambiguity to the hilt, choosing language so excessive that it cannot possibly be contained within ordinary boundaries. By building several alternative readings into the text, Eliot relativizes and ironizes all of them, forcing the reader to explore human nature and its capacity for violence.

<p>
One other clearly intentional ambiguity should be noted. The prostitute is referred to as the "epileptic on the bed," leading many critics to conclude that she is an epileptic and that the ruckus on the bed is a postcoital epileptic fit. This is clearly a valid reading, but not the only one to consider. The other prostitutes diagnose the woman's problem as hysteria, and their diagnosis is literally coherent. But why, then, is she called "the epileptic" on the bed? And why do her actions (shrieking, clutching her sides, curving backwards) correspond to those of someone having an epileptic fit? From classical times, the resemblance between a sexual orgasm and an epileptic fit has been noticed and feared, and over centuries and across cultures, orgasm has been referred to in crude jokes as an epileptic fit. The saying&#8212;"Coitus is a slight epileptic 
<b></b>
attack"&#8212;is very old indeed, and has been attributed to both Hippocrates and Democritus.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  Epilepsy was commonly known as "falling sickness," not just because of the fact that epileptics fall down, but because the disease was considered to have been caused by sin. But epilepsy was also known as "the sacred disease," associated since classical times with possession by an unknown god ("PP," 52). In "Sweeney Erect," references to uncontrollable bodily violence, sexual orgasm, sin, and mystical union are clustered in a systematic way. One of many effects is that violence and sexuality are placed at a pivot point between the physical and the spiritual, disease and mysticism, falling and rising, loss of self-consciousness through sexual intercourse and loss of self-consciousness through union with the divine.

<p>
With the Sweeney narrative in mind, one can more easily understand the epigraph and first two stanzas of "Sweeney Erect." They introduce and contextualize the contemporary tale by preparing a symbolic landscape for it. There are two basic allusions here, and both show the effects of violence on women and on the earth. The first allusion deals with Aspatia, a character in <i>The Maid's Tragedy</i> by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher. The second, embedded in the first, deals with Ariadne, who gave Theseus the ball of thread enabling him to escape from the Minotaur.

<p>
The epigraph quotes a few lines from <i>The Maid's Tragedy</i> (II.ii.81-84), a play that Eliot was probably discussing with students and that was included on the syllabus of his extension course in 1918 (<i>EDA,</i> 481). The maid in question is Aspatia, and her tragedy is that she has been abandoned by her lover Armintor. She speaks the lines quoted in Eliot's epigraph to her female servants, who are working on a tapestry showing Ariadne abandoned on the rocky island of Naxos. Aspatia tells her wenches that their tapestry does not do justice to Ariadne's plight. Since Aspatia herself has just been betrayed, she suggests that they start over, using her as a model for the "lost Ariadne" and creating a landscape which shall "tell" of her desolation.




<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
<p>
Doe it againe, by me the lost Aspatia,


<br />. . .

<br />
And thinke I stand upon the sea beach now,

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

. . . and let all about me

<br />

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Aspatia maintains that the appropriate symbol for an abandoned woman is a waste land&#8212;rocky, dry, leafless, and fruitless. In the first two quatrains, Eliot extends Aspatia's lament and augments her instructions for creating such a landscape&#8212;one that will "tell" of Ariadne, standing on the rocky shore, watching her lover sail away.



<b></b>

<p>

<blockquote>

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swell with haste the perjured sails.

</blockquote>

<p>
Ariadne, whose story Eliot takes from Catullus 64 and from Ovid's <i>Heroides</i> 10, was the daughter of King Minos of Crete, best known for building the Labyrinth to house the Minotaur. Each year, he forced the King of Athens to give him as tribute seven young boys and seven young girls. The young Athenians were put in the Labyrinth with the monster, and once in, could not find their way out and were eaten alive. Theseus, Prince of Athens, thought that he could outwit the Minotaur, and so volunteered to be one of the young men to enter the Labyrinth. He would have met the same fate as his predecessors, but that the princess Ariadne had given him a ball of string with which to retrace his steps to the entrance. In gratitude, Theseus promised to marry her, but deserted her upon their reaching the stony island of Naxos. In one version, she hanged herself; in another, she was rescued by Dionysus.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 

<p>
These allusions introduce the gender issue in terms less equivocal than those of the Sweeney narrative. In both the Renaissance play and the Greek myth, there is a genuine "maid's tragedy." In both tales, the male is a villain and without excuse, and the female a victim and entirely innocent. He is the actor, and she the one who suffers. And in both cases, the appropriate symbol for her desolation is a ruined land. In the opening stanzas of "Sweeney Erect," Aspatia speaks from within the text, beseeching the reader to look at her as an example of desolation and to imagine a landscape that will reveal that the feminine has been violated. Her voice is not ironized, and thus, like Ariadne in the myth, she elicits sympathy for herself and scorn for her betrayer. Having prepared this stage, Eliot brings in Sweeney and a prostitute. Simply placing these characters against this backdrop deeply ironizes the poem. The hysterical woman on the bed is a ruined woman, but she is no "wronged Aspatia." In this "maid's tragedy," she and her gentleman caller are birds of a feather, the main difference being that he is capable of greater harm because he is physically stronger. In the allusions, the desolation of the woman is "told" by the desolation of the landscape, and in this poem, the desolation of the land can be told from the condition of the epileptic on the bed. As he will in <i>The Waste Land,</i> Eliot here suggests the closest connection between violence and violation of the feminine. In the modern tragedy, the "maid" is more than a maid and more than a symbol of women; she is the feminine principle twisted by hatred and violence. This can be seen in individual relations by the brutal Sweeney and the defeminized Doris, and on the international level, by the devastation of the earth on the Western Front. It is difficult, in fact, to imagine more vicious assaults on the feminine than those commenced at Verdun in February 1916 and on the Somme on 1 July 1916.


<b></b>
<p>


Eliot structures this poem to create a palimpsest of mostly female characters who face monsters in labyrinthine situations. The women include Ariadne and Aspatia, the prostitute and the "ladies of the house." All of them can be imagined as standing with tangled hair on the shore, all weeping with Ariadne among the "bold anfractuous rocks." "Anfractuous" means tortuous or twisting, and full of unexpected turns. Although it is an odd word to use to describe rocks, it does serve, as Arrowsmith points out, to connect the rocks of Naxos with the Labyrinth of Crete ("PP," 55). Like the young Athenian maidens in the Labyrinth, Ariadne is left to die in the passageways of the desolate island surrounded by snarling seas. The monster who destroys her is not the Minotaur, but the man who brings her there and abandons her. In "Sweeney Erect," the prostitute also faces an insensitive and brutal beast in a house of corridors; she is not, however, simply a victim of rape. Unlike "lost Ariadne" and "wrong'd Aspatia," she is implicated in her desolation. The strange complicity of predator and prey is explored with even greater complexity in "Gerontion," written about a year after "Sweeney Erect." In that poem, history is described as a giant whore, but also as a labyrinth with many cunning corridors. History herself is the ruined maid, the abused and abusing feminine, whose labyrinthine womb supplies men for the labyrinthine tombs of northern France and Gallipoli.

<p>
The powerful representation of the confluence of sexuality and violence in Eliot's poems of 1917-19 should be understood in the context of the Great War and its effect on English and European life. The Sweeney poems in particular suggest the entanglement of sexuality and violence in nature and in culture. These poems present a snapshot of humankind on the thin line between the bestial and the fully human, and suggest the complex but fragile situation of human beings in the modern world. Like his avatars, Sweeney carries a "razor" which can be used for shaving or for murder, for adorning the self or destroying the other. This picture of human nature is inseparable from Eliot's personal attempt to understand his own moment in history&#8212;not in the abstract, but in the bedroom of his flat, in his office at Lloyd's Bank, in shell-shocked London, and as reported from the valley of the Somme. The labyrinth in his work is moral, political, sexual, and finally, it is hermeneutical. To read, Eliot suggests, is to enter the labyrinth; to encounter language is to face the minotaur of interpretation.

Culturalist readings analyzing how social debates and meanings are inscribed in art works and ancillary texts must not&#8212;and need not&#8212;lose formal specificity or overlook the nuanced, pleasurable textiness of texts. The challenge of reading twentieth-century poetry in relation to modernity is to find a method of mediation between what is said <i>in</i> poetry and what is said <i>as</i> poetry, a method that attends to the interdependent mesh of a text's social and aesthetic aspects. Otherwise a poetic text has to be seen reductively as a bizarre choice of message delivery system for ideas&#8212;something inexplicably quirky and rather less effective than writing polemic or "sending a telegram." Paraphrasable meaning is hardly all a reader seeks and authorial claims of what is intended cannot illuminate all a text's territory or its effects.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Hence, one must use a postformalist reading strategy willing to look at the deep formal mechanisms of literary texts with a kind of "New Critical" care, yet linking formal moves to the issues that purist new criticism rejected: social substance, biographical traces, constructions of subjectivity, historical debates, and ideological strata. My position&#8212;shown in a particular way in my recent book on modern poetry&#8212;is that language choices, forms, and the making of poetic artifacts can be read in relation to subjectivity, cultural ideology, and social circumstance, to echo Susan Wolfson.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 I have called this kind of culturalist close reading a social philology.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>


<p>
Further, one specific activist strand of cultural criticism that has contributed to new modernist studies&#8212;that is, gender studies or feminist criticism&#8212;has, as part of its "repoliticization of the aesthetic sphere," insisted on the examination of gendered 
<b></b>
materials in the apparatus of poesis.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 This means not only looking at institutions around poetry (patronage, publication, reception, canonizing trends, coterie groups, poetic careers), but also analyzing cultural conventions and institutionalized topoi inside poetry that have a gendered torque. One part of the apparatus of poesis is the relation of gendered muse to poet. This is a particularly fraught site because it involves cultural convention, biographical materials, literary representation, and their reinvention in any particular situated case. That is, subject positions such as "muse" or "inspired by a muse" appear variously in poetic tradition as res and in real life as biographical choices and activities ideologically and culturally available to people situating themselves inside careers.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Other gendered materials in the apparatus of poesis include the subject positions of poet, poetess, and genius, what is played out in each, and how these interactive postures emerge inside texts and in ancillary situations at historically determinate times. These subject positions are culturally institutionalized and personally, if unevenly, internalized&#8212;as shown in Svetlana Boym's work on the tropes of femininity in "the death of the poetess," which examines her character as a mix of excess and lack, and Barbara Johnson's work on "male [poet's] privilege as the right to play femininity."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 These positions can emerge in texts as recurrent but variable motifs, topoi that are necessarily susceptible to some kind of situational reading because of the mix of social, ideological, and even historical materials condensed in them.

<p>
A glance at one-frame cartoons, whether in <i>The New Yorker</i> or elsewhere, will convince anyone of the ideological persistence of muse motifs (often red in relation to visual artists): at its most banal, this is a beneficent, lovely, noble, and saintly female re who inspires a male artist, yet who may capriciously and inexplicably, or pedagogically, withhold favors causing artistic blockage or further growth. There are also parodic and satiric uses of muse motifs that depend on our sense of the convention. The interplay between passivity and activity, initiator and recipient seems to run counter to gender stereotype, raising the issue that&#8212;in a kind of Dinnersteinian historical psychology&#8212;the muse has her psychological origin in the imprint of the powerful mother on the needy baby.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Considering the muse in his 1994 "Gendering the Muse," Jed Rasula has proposed the re as embodying the hope of surpassing one's own limits, thus acknowledging the creative self as hybrid&#8212;a gender hybrid. He builds a mythopoetic argument that what we call the muse is the site of a poet's own embedded otherness. Poetry takes shape in an "underwriting" or "underwritten" guarantee of "male poetic authority" by a "differently gendered" voice "pre-articulated inside" a poet. But once the "muse" is thus interpreted as a metaphor for an interior projection of power that allows one to hybridize oneself, there is no particular reason for it to manifest any gender narrative. Rasula speculates why it would.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 For male poets, the sense of having another growth inside is a male imitation of the feelings women have if and when they are successfully pregnant, since "that men don't give birth is one of the more thoroughly repressed of cultural traumas."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 This formulation does not straightforwardly transfer to women poets, but it does foreground gender conventions in the apparatus of poesis and might suggest that looking for the "repressed gender traumas" of women would be a place in which to speculate transhistorically about muse res 
<b></b>
for females. Rasula presents the primal scene of poesis not as maternal nourishment, nor sublimated sexual intercourse, nor eroticized chastity, but as imitative pregnancy: a couvade of a semi-autonomous otherness that speaks from the inside.

<p>
This formulation is suggestive, but, even granting some of this synoptic generalization, I want to be a little less archetypal and more situational. Any muse re used in a particular poem or life is still based in specific gender relations that are sustained, remixed, and activated in historical time by individuals seeking to establish their creative agency. Thus I want here to undergeneralize, even myopically, and offer a close reading of a well-known poem in order to discuss a female re as represented by one male writer, reading both his investment in this re and her own qualities.

<p>
Theodor Adorno is one critic to whom it is necessary to turn for an analysis of how social materials emerge in poetic texts. While most critics of poetry have maintained, until quite recently, a resistance to any analyses of poetry's political and ideological representations, Adorno's 1957 essay, "On Lyric Poetry and Society" argues that the subject of a poem (the "I," generally) speaks indirectly about a social meaning or contradiction.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 My thesis, says Adorno, "is that the lyric work is always the subjective expression of a social antagonism" ("OLP," 45). The final pages of "On Lyric Poetry and Society" analyze two poems with strong muse-poet relations, interpreting the epiphanic luminosity and personal yearning in Eduard M&ouml;rike and Stefan George as desires inscribed in reverse for community and utopic change. These, however, are peculiarly unsatisfying analyses. 
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>


<p>
One analysis, of a poem by M&ouml;rike that speaks of a little town and the streets, flowers, blossoms, and breezes found there, suggests "the paradox of lyric poetry in the ascending industrial age" ("OLP," 50). The lyric rises to epiphanic flashes of comfort and pleasure that restore (via a cosy town and a domesticated, accessible nature) a sense of psychic equilibrium and hope to an individual. That poem finishes, in the English translation, "Oh muse, you have touched my heart, / With a breath of love!" ("OLP," 48). The second lyric cited by Adorno is George's twelve line poem about a desirable "object," as they say: "from a moist night / a gleam ignites . . . Now I must / For your eyes and hair / Every day / Live in yearning." These four lines, heard by Adorno as "some of the most irresistible lines in German poetry," are saved in the English translation from their own sweet and normative banality by the imagination of the non-normative love object whom the male poet addresses ("OLP," 53). Male ephebe-mentor relations structure a masculinity and a femininity without women.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>


<p>
For Adorno, lyric language, with its burden of erotic longing for the other, "represents the idea of a free humankind"; erotic yearning is a way of saying political yearning ("OLP," 53). Yearning and love are absolutized, set out as an unquestionable part of the apparatus and mechanism of lyric poetry. The "Oh muse," the "breath of love" in one poem, and the "live in yearning" of the other lead to and provoke social interpretation for Adorno, but they are not seen by him as what needs to be interpreted. Erotic yearning does not have an epidemiology, nor private emotions a history. The poetic conventions re-presented or evoked in "Oh muse," in "breath of love," and "live in yearning" are taken for granted. (Or, as my students sometimes write, taken for 
<b></b>
granite.) What do these words mean? What is muse in any poem? What is love as a specific poem represents it? Has Adorno desocialized these eminently conventional (that is, social) elements of poetry so he can transpose them to what he assumes to be more "social" forms and practices&#8212;those of community and utopia?

<p>
This avoidance is connected with another: the finesse with which Adorno avoids or sidesteps mentioning the situation of love-yearning and muse-relations most generally produced in the lyric poem as a genre: one that uses female res. That is, if the M&ouml;rike poem is about a rush of heightened feeling for the (Wordsworthian) "sense sublime / Of something far more deeply interfused" inside a single individual touched with a muse's blessing, and if the George poem is about male love-yearning for a male adolescent ephebe (a fact that Adorno knows well, as he himself alludes to the Maximin cult), then the issue of the lyric and its construction of female objects, and the issue of poetic muses and the female gender have been distinctly avoided in this analysis (ibid.).

<p>
The gaze on the beloved, the heterosexual object of yearning, the scrutiny of the female re&#8212;the anatomy of Her beauties or intellectual perfections, the yearning for something she represents, the evocation of love and situations of courtship, the inspiration of that re&#8212;all parts of the "foundational cluster" of the lyric, all central to the lyric, are not taken up by Adorno. That is, missing from Adorno's analysis are heterosexual yearning and burning and the construction of semi-mythological muses out of actual females; Petrarchan topoi simple or complicated; poems addressed to women or that construct female res inside the text; poems that help to structure female and male as gender ideas; and the representing or slanting of gender ideas that contribute to poetry as such. Is this an implicit argument that "personal" love, or muse-poet relations, and normative gender materials of poetry have no social meaning unless they are an allegory of community? Such muse/heterosexual love tropes also deserve readings of their social imprint and implications.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>


<p>
Of course, it is possible that such issues are "imprinted in reverse" on the Adorno essay; such an obvious lacuna might be investigated for its evidence. Perhaps the status of women in the world was changing so drastically in the years of these poems, the years from romanticism to modernism, that Adorno could not get a settled social position on these matters from the evidence of poems and hence made no comment. Nonetheless this enormous gap in Adorno's essay shows how crucial it is that culturalist readings of the gendered materials inside the apparatus of poesis be made.

<p>
A reading of Ezra Pound's "Portrait d'une Femme"  is undertaken here because this canonical work models gendered ideology concerning creativity, elaborating that part of the apparatus of poesis called "the muse."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 By tracing the actual addressee of this poem and contrasting her achievements with those that Pound has selected to depict, I wish to show how his "propounded" form of modern maleness and, more loosely, of poetic genius, depend as subject positions on proposing and maintaining a dehistoricized, despecified female re. This critique does not debate his right to write the poem he wants or needs to write, but rather examines of what that need consists, and points to the ways this poem reaffirms conservatizing gender 
<b></b>
narratives through individual necessity and the personal choices of a poet. The poem lets us examine specific functions attributed to femaleness and maleness in the apparatus of poesis.

<p>
<i>Une</i> is unspecific, not <i>La Femme</i>; with no name given, this "femme" is discussed as a limited muse, a semi-adequate inspiration for a functioning artist, someone whom the speaker must treat elegiacally, regretfully, and from a position of farewell. In this "portrait," with its allusions to visual art even in the French of the title and, of course, to both James's novel of passion, entrapment, renunciation, and collections, and to Pound's admiration of James's ethical realism as a model for poetry, Pound proceeds by deeply interested interpretations&#8212;indeed, repressions&#8212;of the historically attested work of a specific creative woman. He represents his female re within the text as virtual lack, inadvertent creativity, and compromised ability. Attention to both poetic parties inside and outside this poem provides an understanding of these gendered "micropolitics of literary culture."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>


<p>
The female of "Portrait d'une Femme" is, in Pound's depiction, a semi-bourgeoise proto-bohemian, having rejected marital loyalty to "one dull man, dulling and uxorious." She is an older salonniere who holds court, but whose materials are so piled up, impacted, "dimmed," and "tarnished" that they seem virtually useless. Yet the re surprises the speaker by what she can give to others, and by her "patience" at collecting or letting stuff pool around her. The muse motif is strongly, if secularly, articulated.

<p>

<blockquote>

. . . now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay.

<br />
You are a person of some interest, one comes to you

<br />
And takes strange gain away. . . .
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Although the metaphors here are Jamesian, the speaker of the poem sits in some judgment of the re being portrayed; there is no particular hint of bachelor impotence in the speaker's voice, but rather a kind of elegant, summary, appreciative condescension. The Jamesian images of paying and double-edged interest and the sense of possession still conclude in "nothing": that "in the whole and all, / Nothing that's quite your own. / Yet this is you." Having the final line be a two-beat hemistich (after a passage of iambic pentameter) dramatizes this inadequacy. Being an unpossessive conduit is a precise description of the "conditions of employment" for a muse re.

<p>
In the enunciation, Pound brings the whole tradition of Shakespearean blank verse&#8212;the articulate packing of the line, the mobile caesura, the personable, meditative tone, the Renaissance diction with its "mandrakes" and "ambergris"&#8212;to bear witness both to this female re's inspiration and to her passivity. The female re is the site at which such bisexually fertile images as "pregnant with mandrakes" (giving birth to phallic materials) and "ambergris" (an excretion of sperm whales used for perfume) can be articulated, and taken as the "gain" of the male speaker. The female object can manifest or exude these goods, but cannot claim or use them. Thus the poem presents the homosocial bonding of Shakespeare and Pound (in the enunciation) over the body of the female re in the enounced, one who inspires genius but cannot herself create.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<b></b>
The diction is highly motivated: the supplement of Shakespearean tonality supports Pound's own genius subject position. By its diction, the poem is taken out of time; it has created a magic world where no modern markers intrude, no technology, no motor horns, no signs of modernity in the language. The only time marker alludes to the re's age. The line "London has swept about you this score years" reduces the re's agency as it notes her long-lasting presence.

<p>
Thoroughly static, and like a stall and trap for ships (the Sargasso Sea), the female re of the enounced is a spot at which a terrific amount of detritus and rich materials passively collect and jumble. The re lacks center and teleological energies; she is only a dump or midden, "naturally" accumulating debris: something indicated in the long, synactically flexible list in the second half of the poem. And yet, while she is taxed for unoriginality, she is (appropriately, in 1912) inventing collage: accumulating fragments, juxtaposing these, resisting representational design, foregrounding the detail, combining the old and new ("strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff"). Thus the speaker describes the re as proposing, semi-consciously, a major strategy of modernist presentation but in a retro "Victorian" bric-&agrave;-brac mode.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 The poem becomes a muted, backhanded tribute. In the strain of the thrice-repeated word "strange," the speaker acknowledges this artistic mode while disparaging its source.

<p>
"Great minds have sought you&#8212;lacking someone else. / You have been second always." These are the most ferocious lines in an otherwise temperate statement, making her into an apparent stopgap in a narrative of inspiration or romance. These issues can be further enlarged when the poem's historical addressee is identified. Florence Farr is the original of the "portrait d'une femme," and the poem is a Poundian redaction of this New Woman of striking cultural force from a generation before his.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 A. Walton Litz calls Farr an embodiment of an Ibsen type of "'transitional' woman," but certainly more than "Shaw's 'lover' and chosen mouthpiece, Yeats's musical muse, [or] Pound's passive sitter for his twentieth-century version of a Jamesean portrait."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Beyond the interest in this historical woman, I am methodologically interested in the tone, mechanisms, and materiality of the poem as artifact and will not import "facts" about the identification of Farr as if they could prove or disprove the poem's force. Indeed, the gap, contradiction, and interplay between the depiction of the female re and Farr's work give the most information to this reading.

<p>
Florence Farr [Emery] (1860-1917) was an actress, a socialist, a theosophist, a feminist, and (in her final years) an educator in Sri Lanka. Farr was friend of and co-author with Olivia Shakespear (Pound's future mother-in-law), friend and inspiration of George Bernard Shaw (his <i>Arms and the Man</i> was written for her), singer for and inspiration of W. B. Yeats, an actress, novelist, and polemicist&#8212;and taken, in her time, as a quintessential New Woman. Farr played the character Rebecca West in the 1891 London premiere of Ibsen's <i>Rosmersholm</i> and, in 1907, published a series of six essays treating Ibsen's heroines as if they were real female types with contemporary problems, doing striking character analyses of their motivations and passions. As she moved into the Yeats orbit from the Shaw orbit&#8212;a serious shift&#8212;Farr produced one Yeats play in 1894, and acted in others in 1899 and 1905.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 She was active with Yeats in 
<b></b>
Golden Dawn occult and mystical performances, and the recipient of his letters from 1895 through 1906.

<p>
While she emphatically "inspired," she also emphatically possessed and deployed considerable artistic and critical agency. Farr was an emergent New Woman with emancipatory flair, one of those "heroines of modernity" in Rita Felski's terms, who gives the lie to implicit claims of many theories of modernity "that women were situated outside processes of history and social change." As such, this poem allows us real purchase on the problem of reading "the modern in relation to gender politics."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 As a woman who played the muse but also mused the play, she situated herself on both sides of the muse-agent compact. Perhaps her passionate inspiring of these men was a useful cover for her active agency. Perhaps, more likely, for females entering modernity such as Farr, artistic agency and erotically-charged inspiring were mixed with free love bravura, giving tremendous professional power and satisfaction in ways that the pure stereotyped form of "muse" wisdom-in-passivity-and-sublimation cannot articulate. In the 1890s, Farr's intellectual or cultural allegiances were in a "debate" between spiritualist, theosophical practices of esoteric "religious" forms and socialist critiques of bourgeois life: that is, she made herself the container of debate between these two rival world views. In biographical terms this debate was enacted between Yeats and Shaw, who each regretted the influence of the other on Farr.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Yet because the theosophical was also very feminist in implication, with its priestesses and goddesses, offering women adepts paths of spiritual power and cultic status, and because the anti-bourgeois socialist asked a number of telling questions about women's status, one might see Farr's position as synthesizing elements concerning female power and critique from these two rival worldviews.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 When Litz summarizes her 1907 <i>New Age</i> articles and publishes her Ibsen character portraits (also from 1907), he argues for her primal embodiment of Ibsen's ideas on women's passionate striving&#8212;sexually, intellectually, socially, in the world, and in the family.

<p>
It is the Yeats aspect of Farr's life&#8212;her sexual, productive, and professional life&#8212;that interested Pound; he met Farr in 1909 at the Poets' Club as he was hoping to enter Yeats's orbit himself.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Farr, a noted performer, had been known for chanting Yeats' poems to an instrument "half-lyre, half-psaltery" (made for her by Arnold Dolmetsch), an activity that the two took very seriously from about 1901 to 1905.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 She wrote music that Yeats was very eager to see included in a 1907 edition of his plays; some of which does appear in "Speaking to the Psaltery," from 1907, an essay that also contains a section by Farr. (<i>L,</i> 491-4). Yeats defended their music-of-poetry practice in letters to both Robert Bridges  and Arthur Symons . Yeats and Farr gave lecture-demonstrations in a number of cities to showcase her "extraordinarily impressive and poetical" method of <i>sprechstimme</i>; in 1907 she toured America giving lectures on music and poetry.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Mark Morrisson has recently commented upon how Farr's artistic elocution helped to focus modernist poetics on "the impersonal performance of the pure voice."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 Farr's book <i>The Music of Speech</i>  solidified her position as an expert in both the theory and practice of the relation of poetry and music; it is notable that this book was dedicated to Yeats and Arnold Dolmetsch. Pound 
<b></b>
was also doing his research on the relation of music and poetry, possibly impelled by, inspired by, or catching up to this Yeats-Farr-Dolmetsch cluster of activity. Pound's essays-in-tribute to Dolmetsch date from 1918, one of which is filled with hearty allusions to belatedness.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Through the years from about 1909 to 1910, Pound seems to have had a sense of rivalry with Farr, an interest in focusing Yeats's attention on himself in an area in which Farr had significant professional expertise.

<p>
While seeming like a romance/muse plot in the poem, the speaker's line to "Farr" as "femme," "Great minds have sought you&#8212;lacking someone else," can be reseen as an articulation of Pound's rivalry with Farr signaling Pound's desire to displace Farr's analysis of the musical performance of poetry with Pound's (the "someone else") in the sight of Yeats, the great mind.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 The speaker of Pound's poem seems to allude to Pound's own desire to catch up with these influential music-and-poetry ideas, the poem itself offering the sub-rosa claim that the Farr-based re (and covertly, her work) had, by 1912, become collective property, belonging to us. This is suggested in the pun propelled by an emphatic, odd line break: "I have seen you sit / Hours" becoming "I have seen you sit[,] / [ours]." This line also alludes to Pound's construction of a homosocial bond between Yeats and himself via Farr, instead of an oedipal Pound looking at the intense couple Farr and Yeats, a couple professionally and at times sexually active. Indeed, the plethora of art-objects in the poem, the wash of furniture and stuff, might be thought of as being precisely <i>not</i> about music, a deflection from the medium in which Pound's actual rivalry with Farr was expressed. On displacing Farr, Pound may have been celebrating some real life satisfaction in this poem: Yeats wrote to Lady Gregory in December 1910 that "this queer creature Ezra Pound, who has become really a great authority on the troubadours, has, I think, got closer to the right sort of music for poetry than Mrs. Emery [Farr]." Although Pound "can't sing" and sounds like a "very bad phonograph," Yeats nonetheless accepts him as a belated, amusing, but sincere collaborator.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 No matter the biographical facts of Farr's agency, originality, and influence on music-poetry thinking, and her spurring of Pound's interest, the poem constructs "femme" as having become inadequate, displaceable.

<p>
At the beginning of his "Treatise on Metre," written in 1934, several decades after Farr's death, Pound has another last word. Pound positions himself as having performed a great service&#8212;a troubadour-like service&#8212;in this music/poetry nexus: "I heard a fair lady sigh, 'I wish someone would write a good treatise on prosody.' As she had been a famous actress of Ibsen, this was not simple dilettantism. . . ."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 This is again, of course, a portrait, by Pound, of the unnamed Farr as female re. In this comment, he honors Farr; yet his honoring has two conflicting dimensions. He mentions her fame and her work (which nonetheless exist far away in the past perfect&#8212;"had been"), but focuses on her "fair lady" needs, whose desirous "sighs" (a metaphor from romance) he is about to satisfy with his knowledge of prosody. The phrase "not <i>simple</i> dilettantism" (emphasis added) raises the damaging specter of <i>complex</i> dilettantism, certainly a possible reading of Farr's life and one reading of all the floating stuff in the poem (as the remains of the dilettante). But Pound's raising the specter of the dilettante at all, rather than the fact of Farr's professional expertise, is reductive, and a 
<b></b>
striking choice in 1934, when the wench, so to speak, is dead. Farr's expertise is thus something that Pound had at once imitated in his criticism and carefully, jealously reduced both in the portrait and twenty-two years after, in his remarks prefacing "Treatise on Metre."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>


<p>
The particular mechanism in Pound's poem has to do with the repositioning of female work. The word "work" appears in the poem as a noun: the female re is not depicted as working, but as someone who sits in the vicinity of "the loom of days" and whose visitors find around her "tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work," an accomplishment without agency, for which she is not visibly responsible. The poem itself is a mechanism that separates Farr from her work (in acting, in writing, in theorizing song and performance), while it claims as collective property anything found, pooled, or caught near this female "Sargasso" re as geographical site; the poem is as if under admiralty law, with the speaker claiming the right of salvage to whatever is washed up. Some form of "possession" of Farr and her work&#8212;parallel to her work with Shaw and then Yeats&#8212;marked a male artist as central in status; Pound's tactic is to take this work and to insist on the passivity of the muse rather than the push-pull activity of male and female cultural workers.

<p>
Pound produces his work (this poem) by the thematic occlusion inside it of the work of the woman (Farr) on whom the poem is based. Farr at fifty-two years in 1912 was still a token of enough importance or suggestiveness so that one might discuss, in the poem, or produce in the poem, her marginalization. This is visible in Pound's allusive word-layering: the speaker of the poem shows ambivalence toward the female re's power in the minor phallicism of the phrase "strange spars of knowledge," from the "bright ships"&#8212;by simultaneously adducing her lack, in the word "sparse," but also acknowledging how the re "spurs" the speaker on. "Spars" may also be a noun meaning the act of sparring, disputing, boxing, or contending with words. This shadow of possible debate or sparring and the eloquence of the re&#8212;or of Farr as model&#8212;is also very suggestive, given her own passionate analyses of female passions, sex and gender struggles, and women's "burning will and striving intellect"&#8212;a Keatsian/Yeatsian phrase she uses to describe the character of Rebecca West in the "Ibsen's Women" series ("FF," 94).

<p>
The poem's mechanisms propose a solution not only to Farr's talents on the music-poetry scene, but to her "problematic" feminist opinions as well. Farr's other 1907-8 articles were full of feminism: the feminism of women active and independent for the (eugenic) good of the race; the pleasures and dangers of sexual expression; and the outrage of the "economic bargain" women must make in marriage ("FF," 88-9). In her essays on Ibsen, the one word that recurs is "passion," and she is exact about what Ibsen came to represent in the way of radical, tragic striving of women whose passions and social spaces did not coincide. Farr speaks of women "bored by marriage," with "dim yearnings for an intellectual comradeship with men"; whose lives are bounded by "Suburbia"; who struggle against "social convention"; and who have a particular resistance to the insincere "general atmosphere of mutual flattery" that characterizes the bourgeois "home as an institution" ("FF," 92, 98). Farr argues for open relationships,
<b></b>
as "social units constantly subject to change," wherein men and women can attain "a more vivid existence" through rejecting the "little stagnant pools" of their mandated ties ("FF," 98). This rejection of stagnation is precisely opposite to that stasis with which, in the "Sargasso" metaphor, Pound taxes Farr.

<p>
The "Sargasso Sea muddle" that gives Pound his image (or that echoes a metaphor already in the poem) also appears in Dorothy Shakespear's comments upon Florence Farr's 1912 novel, <i>The Solemnization of Jacklin: Some Adventures on the Search for Reality.</i> Dorothy Shakespear's comments of July 1912 reiterate Pound's sentiments about Farr, while also repeating his Sargasso Sea image. Engaged to be married to Pound (they were to marry in April 1914), Dorothy is clearly provoked by Farr's essayistic fulminations on marriage and the market value of women.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 In Pound's poem, Farr's principled suspicion of marriage emerges, weakened, as the re's choice to avoid boring middle-class "uxoriousness." But although <i>The Solemnization of Jacklin</i> is more a watered-down Meredithian study of a female's search for experience than an anti-marriage novel, still Farr's work does contain studied passages that offer stiff and radical New Woman critiques of marriage for its "Commercial Aspect," and of women for their degraded complacency in economic slavery&#8212;offering sexual services for money whether outside marriage or inside it. "Why was it, she asked herself, that it was impossible for women to make money as easily as men did; why was it always slavery or marriage for them? . . . She suddenly realised that she belonged to a race of creatures maintained for the pleasure they could give their masters&#8212;their paymasters" is one such heartfelt and bitter chunk, linking prostitution and marriage as parts of the same sex-gender system (<i>SJ,</i> 73). Of these revelations and others, Farr's narrator remarks: "Poor Jacklin [the heroine] woke to this situation in the year 1904, long before the women's movement had any driving power behind it" (<i>SJ,</i> 74). This date is not meant to be comically ironic, although it sounds that way to us; during the years Pound knew her (1909-12), Farr was rather cheered by feminism's driving power for social and political change.

<p>
This novel is dedicated "To the Man Who Shall Be," suggesting that a subject position like New Man should follow upon the New Woman. But the novel also sits in judgment of the reckless female main character for her disparate variety of yearnings&#8212;Fabian, independent, decadent, woman as "the slave of emotion" (<i>SJ,</i> 241). The novel ends with the remarriage of the original couple after various overheated flings and a child from one of those flings sitting with them: "husband and wife looked at each other with eyes full of mutual charity" (<i>SJ,</i> 248). Thus Farr's Ibsenish opinions were rather tempered by a narrative compromise around the marriage plot engineered by the author&#8212;hardly a totally radical solution.

<p>
It is probably irrelevant to discuss Farr's <i>Modern Woman: Her Intentions</i>  at any length because the sheer fact of a fervent, public feminist book stating "This is to be the Woman's Century" only two years before Pound wrote his poem may be all we need to appreciate his work of interpretive erasure in the making of the poem.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Or, at best, we can take the poem as indicating in encoded metaphors his view of Farr's declamations on marriage, prostitution, the vote, economic independence, love, divorce,
<b></b>
and chosen motherhood as pass&eacute;ist trappings, possibly what is referred to as "strange spars of knowledge," "some curious suggestion," and "fact that leads nowhere." At the very least, her book touches topically upon many of the political, social, personal, and moral issues of this central period of feminist struggle. Farr's book is an enthusiastic polemic on many topics, but especially on how the t against the "prisons" that keep women trapped is larger than the vote, and how such struggles will transform social life within modernity (<i>MW,</i> 93).

<p>
Nonetheless, a glance at her introduction alone offers some sense of Farr's particular politics. It is spoken from a patrician, aristocratic, explicitly "white" feminism, and tied to the medieval courtliness of white men, who have had their historical day in the sun as knights and troubadours. They are imagined by her as ting inspired by "their ladies' colours"&#8212;as if all of medieval life were a defense of Western women or done in their name&#8212;a peculiar position at best (<i>MW,</i> 12). "White men have fought in the past [against what it is not said, although to honor women is strongly implied], and it remains for white women to t now, and at last rid their sex all over the world of the ignominy of this false doctrine" (ibid). This "false doctrine" refers to Semitic patriarchal institutions, since the enemy of women's freedom is the "Semites" (Jews and "Mohammedans"&#8212;i.e. Muslims), whose patriarchal control of women was inexplicably reexpressed in Christianity. Farr claims that the world-historical problem at the root of women's oppression is that "the white races adopted the Assyrian Semite's Scriptures" (<i>MW,</i> 8). This snarl of scapegoating, Semiticized representations, patrician racism, and feminism is worth more than the cursory glance I give it here, but her general position is clear. Feminism offers a powerful "alchemy" to ignite the modern world, transmuting its institutions and revaluing its values, but the world doesn't yet much credit this "fire that is to burn it" (<i>MW,</i> 7). If this book is any indication, at age fifty, Farr's outspoken, intellectually wayward fire was rather undimmed.

<p>
Pound's poem shows a fascinated ambivalence toward the creative power and political bite of Farr, both as a New Woman, and as a serious, respected contributor to a Yeats-centered poetry scene, and, before that, to a Shaw and Ibsen-centered theater scene that was generally encoded as "feminist." The real re has been transformed from a critical, powerful, influential, outspoken, and original historical woman into a textual "femme"&#8212;one form of a muse of modernism&#8212;an inadequate, anonymous, and displaceable female re. Hardly static or a dilettante, though a woman of many interests, Florence Farr&#8212;artist, actress, thinker, and performer&#8212;has been rather startlingly recast by Pound. His poem portrays Farr as empty and "second always," instead of a formidable cultural activist, her fervent female striving interpreted as a seaweedy trap or "slow float," and her energetic social criticism a useless backwater.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 All in all, Pound's poem is a mechanism in the service of one kind of male subjectivity&#8212;the active creation of a shallow but provocative female muse for the containment of historical New Woman effervescence and achievement. This is an important move in the relationship of modernism to modernity. By representing a female re in this way, Pound has contained, grounded, or stalled consideration of the impact-laden presence and agency of the "real person" on whom the poem was based, making the re an 
<b></b>
Old Woman with useful muse properties, an exemplum of old stuff that still somehow inspires. Poetic representation masters this female re, using poetic institutions like "muse" in order to deflect attention away from the historical achievements of Farr, the hidden subject.

<p>
What else could be at stake here? To answer, I must assume that the "over-elaborate post-Browning "'Imagiste' affair"&#8212;a poem that Pound sent to Harriet Monroe in August 1912&#8212;is this same "Portrait d'une Femme."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 If this phrase does describe "Portrait d'une Femme," it marks a curious conflicting transition in his poetry&#8212;for how could something be at once "over-elaborate" and "Imagiste'" given those "few rules" of imagism, a movement invented circa December 1912 and elaborated in those well-known dicta early in 1913? "Portrait d'une Femme" is arguably the precise opposite of imagist work: it is an <i>indirect</i> treatment of "the thing," saturated with adjective and repetition far beyond condensed efficiencies of "the presentation," and composed not in forward-looking, musical free verse, but using a pentameter "metronome."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 Given this symptomatic conflict between statement and poem, what else is at stake? The pressure from futurist polemicist Filippo Marinetti.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 His work was available in London from 1910, when he presented his ideas at the Lyceum Club and in 1912, when a March lecture on futurism was given the same day that Pound delivered his second lecture on the troubadours, concerning Arnault Daniel.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 In a "careerist" reading, Litz and Lawrence Rainey propose that the enormous 1912 success of Marinetti's avant-garde proposals and affronts, in contrast to Pound's work in "literary culture" as "a restricted aristocracy of sensibility," directly motivated imagism's invention.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 To make his cultural mark, they argue, Pound felt he had to construct some distinctive, audacious product, and not simply that which embodied and represented the cultural heritage of the past. The poem expresses this debate.

<p>
The "femme" is surrounded in her pool of debris with all the cultural materials that kept Pound from being perfectly modern in the audacious Marinetti sense: a lack of an "aggressive character," an attachment to beauty, a "pensive immobility," and stasis (rather than "speed"). A whole past of beautiful but waterlogged cultural goods swirls around this re&#8212;goods by which Pound was insistently and overwhelmingly tempted, but that were ultimately cast away in millennial futurist provocations: "we will destroy the museums, libraries. . . . will t moralism, feminism . . ."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 To rid himself of the "museum"-quality goods that make culture soggy, Pound attributes them to the "femme," finds them damaged although tempting, and then wards them off in the "No!" and "Nothing." To possess these materials is to be swamped by culture as it was, to be able to have nothing that's "quite your own." The double move of identification with the materials and rejection of them is contradictory, of course; this contradiction is a coiled spring giving the poem power. No matter that Farr's own personal culture (as a real individual) may have been as modern (in her feminism) as it was retro (in her medievalism). This was exactly the kind of synthesis Pound used to desire, but now had to reject in order to position himself as adequately, truly modern from not quite modern enough.



<b></b>

<p>
Thus the poem is described proleptically as "post-Browning" although it is not at all beyond Browning&#8212;it is Browningesque, imitated after Browning, and "post-" only in that sense. The poem is described as "Imagiste" although it is not imagiste at all; it is rather rhetorically "over-elaborate." Hence this lack of fit between his description and his poem is itself precise evidence of the tension between Pound's "Victorian modernism" and his desires for a diction-cleansing, culture-purging rupture in some emphatic mode.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 The inaccurate description both exposes his inadequate modernism and is an act of dislodging to rectify that inadequacy. To acknowledge the old muse, to establish his career power, to scapegoat her materials even as he is tempted, to cast her off in the last lines as unoriginal&#8212;these are vital accomplishments.

<p>
Furthermore, if it is possible&#8212;and it is not unlikely&#8212;that in hearing Marinetti's ideas, Pound might have caught wind of the "disprezzo della donna," this program might have focused his attitude toward his "femme." The part of Marinetti's program called "scorn for woman" is an "ideological double helix," in Janet Lyon's words (<i>M,</i> 101). If Marinetti meant "scorn" for the bourgeois, romantic ideology of Womanhood with all the conservative, madonna-esque or feminine manipulations that implies, his phrase could betoken feminist critique of the gender system. If he meant scorn for women as actual people standing in the way of the sleek automotive purgations by violence that his manifesto enacted, or scorn for the effeminate in men, then such scorn had ideological implications in the building of muscular modernist claims by strategic attacks on specific women, on women's activism, and on transgressive gender ideas. This poem, arguably registering Marinetti's interventions, although hardly as slashing, over-stated, or absolute as Marinetti's claims, could be described as Pound's soft-core scorn. In "Portrait d'une Femme," Pound makes the past (his past) pass&eacute;iste by putting it into a female site of entrapment, revealing the enormous temptation of this site, and finally by rejecting that past.

<p>
Pound's particular modernism, soon to be under war pressure, as well as being already under New Woman pressure and pressure from alternative, transgressive sexualities, is gradually coming to be parallel with non-effeminate maleness. Despite the enormous contemporaneous critical thinking on this issue, one kind of masculine sensibility&#8212;"the real sperm of them"&#8212;triumphs within his thinking. Propounding this maleness is part of Pound's notable achievement during this period; it is probably one of his most culturally influential acts within the reception of modernism as well as its production.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 One part of Pound's constructed maleness is sustained, though not without unevenness, by various short and long-term strategies working against the acknowledgment of women as coequal and co-temporal producers of artistic and critical works; yet he evinces a good deal of conflict in relation to any specific woman. As we have seen at length, in this poem the trace of the female re as coequal and co-temporal is reduced, which is rather startling when the nature and opinions of the "real woman," Florence Farr, are considered.

<p>
The poem is the mechanism for the imaginative, and possibly real, consolidation of a male poetic subjectivity as modern by the mellow, "reluctant" disparaging of a female cultural producer, whom Pound perceives as a rival and as a backwater, in two 
<b></b>
different, conflicting narratives involved with fellow male artists: the "Yeats" (and "Shaw") narrative, and the "Marinetti" narrative. Making a historical woman coequal into a poetic muse thins her, controls her agency and impact, evokes the past of poetry as an institution around her, voids her critical Ibsen-inspired interventions into issues of gender, avoids her accomplishments as a performer and musician, and reduces her own modernity to a retro backwater. Indeed, as a cultural institution of poetry used by a modernist, the muse is a mechanism that takes a modern subject&#8212;a New Woman&#8212;and changes her into an encumbered, static, non-modern subject. The poem moves Farr backward, setting her "scores" of years behind her own historical time and achievements, creating female belatedness from a woman pioneer in order to consolidate a male pioneer from a man's sense of his own belatedness. The resistance to acknowledging females as modern subjects (a denial of historicity noted by Rita Felski) may be said to begin in Anglo-American modernism with poems such as this one.

<p>
Pound wittily and carefully uses the poetic conventions of the lyric&#8212;the muse re inside the apparatus of poesis&#8212;to construct a passive retro muse, a female re from an active, provocative influence in historical time. Pound uses poetic convention to protect himself from historical shifts around gender. One can see that his poetic career is forged from intricate cross-and intra-gendered power interactions that include among them friendship, mentoring, misogyny, sex-radical thinking, male potency, sexual hopes and fantasies, and male panic, all of which play against and are inflected by poetic subject positions such as muse. The ultimate purpose of a feminist and historical examination of poetic texts is to change the terms and understandings of poetry definitively, placing issues of gender, the apparatus of poesis, and power-oriented production and reception centrally in play. Asking gendered questions of the ideologies and social situations of poetry as a mode of practice constitutes an opening into the deepest apparatus of poesis.

One can hardly avoid seeing this poem as similar to T. S. Eliot's "Portrait of a Lady," which expresses the speaker's desire to separate from a maternal and genteel re of entrapment and apparently amateur status. However, it is unlikely that Pound knew of this Eliot poem when he wrote his; in 1912 the Eliot poem existed only in manuscript. The two poets did not meet until 1914. Marianne Moore's 1917 "Monkeys"&#8212;with its puma or lynx speaking bitterly about animal-human power relations (possibly a gender allegory), and its ending about the sea's shocking deposits of debris&#8212;seems to be an oblique commentary upon Pound's "Portrait d'une Femme."

Cullingford argues that while patriarchal religion had one male deity, a male priesthood, gender inequality, and asexual or relatively powerless female cult objects like the Virgin Mary, occult religions offered female deities, female adepts, and priestesses high status, and a sense of gender equality with a potentially sexualized and power-laden aura; thus, "the attraction of occult societies for rebellious women is obvious" .

Or, conversely, Pound, the great mind, sought her, lacking someone else (Yeats). In either case she is "second always." It is also possible to "translate" this line in a way suggested by Richard Ellmann: Yeats had an affair with Farr, because Maud Gonne (the "someone else") was not available.

Pound also notes, on the same page, that Yeats can't sing: "he would certainly be incapable of whistling a simple melody in tune. Nevertheless before writing a lyric he is apt to 'get a chune in his head.' He is very sensitive to a limited gamut of rhythms."

<p>
<a name="FOOT32" href="#REF32">32</a>.
Similarly, a provoking split in memories of Farr between her pre-Raphaelite look and her professional activities as capable performer and organizer is articulated in Yeats's final summary, which places Farr in a particular psycho-spiritual grouping in <i>A Vision</i> : "A certain actress [Farr] is typical [of Phase 19], for she surrounds herself with drawings by Burne-Jones in his latest period, and reveres them as they were holy pictures, while her manners are boisterous, dominating, and egotistical. They are faces of silent women, and she is not silent for a moment . . ." W. B. Yeats, <i>A Vision</i> (1938; New York: Macmillan, 1961), 150. The New Woman subjectivity is disparaged in these remarks and viewed as a deception. The consensus is: better silent pre-Raphaelite women than demanding modern ones who have opinions and claims. In the case of Yeats, this judgment is the more striking given Cassandra Laity's argument in her unpublished dissertation that Yeats was indebted to the New Woman in general, and to Farr in particular, in his changed depictions of warrior queens in his drama: decisive, masculine, female res of agency and force.

Fifield, 1912); hereafter abbreviated <i>SJ.</i> Dorothy wrote to Ezra, "Just read a new book by 'Florence Farr.' Such a Sargasso Sea muddle.

Long after this polemical analysis had been written, I found the following in a fascinating study by Kumari Jayawardena, who sketches incisive analytic pictures of European, mainly British, women who contributed in a variety of ways to South Asian life, whether as reformers, educators, or spiritual seekers. She observes that "while Pound is somewhat dismissive of Florence Farr for her dilettantism, not surprisingly, he fails to note or value her feminism, her challenge to patriarchal attitudes and her approach to education." Jayawardena's chapter is mainly devoted to Farr's end-of-career commitment to education for Hindu girls in Sri Lanka; Farr served as principal of a Ramanathan College in Jaffna for several years until just before her death in 1917, a role that became increasingly unsatisfying as her guru turned out to have rather retrograde ideas about the education of girls into wives and mothers. Jayawardena depicts Farr as "misrepresented" by the various men in her life, and uses <i>Modern Woman</i> briefly to trace Farr's feminist politics, although the book's racial politics are not mentioned.

<p>
The poet H.D.'s film-related work of the late-1920s and early-1930s constitutes an important chapter in the history of female modernist theorizing about vision. Through her essays for the film journal <i>Close Up</i> (which she helped to found and edit), her participation in the POOL group's production of several silent films, and her autobiographically-inflected fiction of the period, H.D. participated in and helped to modify a number of discourses within modernist visual culture.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>


<p>
Looking at the body of work H.D. produced during this period for what it might tell us about the nature of modernist visuality, I am struck by a recurring image: that of a woman (H.D. herself or her fictional protagonists) fixedly staring. 
<a name="1" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#1">re 1</a>, from the 1930 film <i>Borderline,</i> suggests the level of intensity that H.D. as an actor and Kenneth Macpherson as her director invested in her stare: the image, a close-up of H.D. looking directly and intently into the camera, remains on screen for ten seconds. Other examples of the sustained, fixed stare abound in the film as well as in H.D.'s prose. In her 1926 story "Hipparchia," published the year before the founding of <i>Close Up,</i> the primary character is repeatedly characterized as "staring, wide-eyed," gazing fixedly, regarding, considering, contemplating, and not only looking but looking <i>and</i> looking. A paragraph describing Hipparchia's visual experience certainly suggests a cinema spectator fascinated and immobilized by patterns of light on a screen: "Her eyes, wide open, stared now upon the squares of neat ceiling . . . Her eyes saw light break across the ceiling, an angle of clear light. . . . She came back (staring, wide-eyed) to the 
<b></b>
ceiling across which the outer light had wandered."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 A well-known example of H.D.'s rapt, entranced gaze appears in her 1944 description of a hallucinatory vision she experienced in 1920: "I do not budge an inch or break the sustained crystal-gazing stare at the wall before me. . . . my own head is splitting with the ache of concentration. I know that if I let go, lessen the intensity of my stare and shut my eyes or even blink my eyes, the pictures will fade out."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>


<p>
What is H.D.'s stare, and why is it such a recurring feature of her representations and self-representations? What is the possible connection of her relentlessly fixed stare to the visual culture(s) of modernism? How and why is her film-related work so invested in an aesthetic of stasis? How was H.D.'s "involve[ment] with pictures" linked to the dynamics of her domestic m&eacute;nage in the late-1920s and early-1930s, which consisted of herself, her longtime female companion Bryher, and Macpherson (her bisexual male lover and Bryher's husband) and which formed the basis of the POOL film production company and the <i>Close Up</i> editorial board?
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 I suggest that investigating H.D.'s stare may tell us something about the contradictions and coexistences at the heart of modernist visuality and, more particularly, about the role of lesbian desire in the model of spectatorship emerging in her work.

<p>
H.D.'s abiding interest in stasis and fixity in visual experience runs counter to a significant discussion among her contemporaries about modern subjectivity and vision: that of the concept of "distraction" and its relation to mass cultural expressive forms, particularly the cinema. The nature of "distraction" was being extensively explored 
<b></b>
in the film criticism of Weimar Germany, where H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson spent time participating in Berlin's burgeoning film culture, seeing new films unavailable in England or Switzerland, and meeting directors like G. W. Pabst.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Many of H.D.'s German contemporaries, most notably Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin, theorized distraction as a peculiarly modern mass psychological state that developed in response to the fractures, shocks, and discontinuities of urban culture. These theorists presented "distraction" as a marked contrast to an older and allegedly outmoded model of attention: that of "contemplation" or "concentration." Concentration and contemplation were often associated in critical writing of this period with classical models of the Cartesian subject: coherent, stable, and occupying a relatively fixed position in relation to the visual object. The distracted subject, on the other hand, suggested a newly fragmented and destabilized model of subjectivity appropriate to the alienated conditions of modernity.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>


<p>
During the period that saw the establishment of the classical narrative film and large "picture palaces" in European capitals, which frequently interspersed film screenings with live vaudeville acts, the states of "distraction" and "contemplation" were often marked by class affiliation. The distracted spectator was generally associated with popular mass-cultural forms and with the urban working class, while the contemplative observer tended to be associated with the bourgeois subject engaged in a sustained relationship with the more traditional visual arts such as painting and sculpture.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 One tension that informs H.D.'s writing for <i>Close Up</i> is that between embracing a popular art form generally associated with "cheap circuses, crowds, . . . illiteracy . . . and . . . a sudden collapse of jerry-built scaffolding" and the desire to construct a more hermetic film culture associated with an exclusive community of avant-garde practitioners and audience members whom she identified as "picture adept[s]."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 H.D. attempted to resolve this tension by invoking a rapt, undistracted gaze in relation to this new and distracting art form.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 The "picture adept" who was the subject of this contemplative gaze was a contradictory creature, one invested in an aesthetic of cinematic stasis modeled on classical statuary but also sensitive to a set of peculiar filmic "vibrations." As I will explore later in the essay, perhaps the most adept of the "picture adepts" emerging as the ideal film audience in H.D.'s work was the lesbian spectator.

<p>
H.D. clearly articulates her aesthetic of cinematic stasis in the 1927 <i>Close Up</i> essay "Cinema and the Classics II: Restraint." In it, H.D. asserts that the primary visual model for a successful cinematic representation is classical Greek statuary ("a pre-fifth or fifth century piece of sculpture") and involves a focus on a single image or gesture, often stripped down to a synecdochic fragment.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 She claims that "[t]he pure classic does not depend for effect . . . on a whole, part has always been important, chiselling and cutting, shaping and revising. A laurel grove rises in one branch set against a plain room wall. . . . perhaps some little unexpected effect of a bare arm lifted might bring back . . . all of antiquity " ("CCR," 111, 114). H.D.'s stage directions for her translation of Euripedes's <i>Ion,</i> published in 1937 but composed in the late teens and the early 1930s, indicate a similar kind of attachment to stasis in dramatic performance: "Gesture may be simple, direct copy of marble arm and bared limb of pentellic frieze. . . . 
<b></b>
He may stand, in hieratic posture, scarcely moving, uttering frigid syllables like a marble statue."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>


<p>
H.D.'s focus on the single gesture and the static, statue-like image arises not only from her early training in imagism and a Paterian aesthetics that placed a high value on artistic "restraint" and the hieratic qualities of Greek statuary, but it also reflects two important developments in the theory and practice of European silent film.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 The first was the Weimar melodrama, which according to Patrice Petro, frequently employed fixed tableaux and "studied compositions at moments of narrative crises" that tended to break "with narrative suspense in favor of an attention to composition and atmosphere."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 The second development, emerging in French film criticism in the years immediately following World War I, shifted the focus from the action or narrative line of a film to the disruptive power of the single cinematic image, which French writers termed <i>photog&eacute;nie.</i>
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 The "photogenic" moment was one in which the single image, though part of a narrative trajectory, entered the foreground of spectatorial attention and, at the same time, gestured toward an enduring, Platonic "reality" beyond the surface image. For film critics such as Emile Vuillermoz writing in the late teens, the photogenic power of the single cinematic image was a remarkably static one: the cinema "cuts out of space and fixes in time inimitable images; [it] seizes in flight and immortalizes the fleeting moment when nature possesses genius" (qtd. in <i>FF,</i> 108). Moreover, for French theorists of <i>photog&eacute;nie,</i> this fixity extended beyond the cinematic image to include the spectator: in the photogenic conception of film, "the camera functioned as a mediator between the spectator and a certain reality or 'world' and as an instrument of revelation. . . . it positioned the spectator before that mediated reality . . . in a state of rapt attention or absorption" (<i>FF,</i> 107). The notion of film as an "instrument of revelation" is one that H.D. certainly supported; she often wrote of the cinema's ability to convey "something behind something," suggesting an unchanging Platonic essence beneath or beyond the surface of the cinematic image.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 This conception of film as a static, revelatory medium is very similar to Walter Pater's assumptions about the nature of Greek statues, which as Eileen Gregory has shown, were influential in the development of H.D.'s poetics. For Pater, classical statues "do not so much exemplify sublimity and nobility of form as they convey revelations of the invisible and eternal" (<i>HH,</i> 41).

<p>
Just as the concept of <i>photog&eacute;nie</i> establishes a defamiliarizing stasis in both image and spectator, H.D.'s valorization of the single, statue-like image within the film also constructs a fixed spectatorial gaze. When H.D. describes her experience of what she perceives as an excess of movement on the screen, her anxiety about its effect on the coherence of the seeing subject is clear: "Ben Hur drove his chariot with decorum and with fervour but . . . when I would begin to criticize I am lost myself in a tangle of exciting detail, am myself so startled and amazed by certain swiftness, certain effects of inevitable precise mass movement . . . that I lose my own clue, become sated and lost and tired" ("CCR," 111). In contrast to the "tangle of exciting detail" in the more dynamic film image that causes the spectator to get "lost," H.D.'s aesthetic agenda for the cinema involves, as she says, the search for the "one gesture (not too frigid and not 
<b></b>
too stagily static)" (ibid.). Her ideal film should, however, be "frigid" and "stagily static" enough to ensure the stability of the spectator's subjectivity:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The true classic is not a thing of built up walls . . . and pasteboard perspective. Streets and by-ways should be on one plane, we should be somewhere, not all over the place. We should be <i>somewhere</i> with our minds, lines should radiate as toward a centre not out and away from the central point of interest. . . . We should <i>be</i> somewhere, our getting on somewhere else will come in due course. ["CCR," 110-11]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
H.D.'s repeated, emphatic plea that "we should be somewhere" suggests an anxiety about visual excess&#8212;not only an excess of movement or objects within the visual field, but also an excess of motion in the spectator's visual attention, generated by an overly-complex set. H.D.'s aesthetic of viewing here seeks to fix the eye's wandering glances within a static, pared-down visual field.

<p>
H.D.'s search for a simplified visual field reflects a development in late-nineteenth-century psychology that defined <i>attention</i> as the ability and need to isolate some aspects of the perceptual field and to exclude others in order to organize sensory input and to ensure the stability of subjectivity. Jonathan Crary suggests that this concept of attention is central to the very notion of individual subjectivity in Western modernity, which "has demanded that individuals define and shape themselves in terms of a capacity for 'paying attention,' that is for disengagement from a broader field of attraction . . . for the sake of isolating or focusing on a reduced number of stimuli."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Similarly, in her fiction, H.D. defines art in terms of a delimiting focus: "The things are there all the time, but art [is] . . . a focus, a sense of proportion like turning the little wheel of an opera glass, getting a great mass of inchoate colour and form into focus, focussing on one small aspect of life though really it is only a tiny circle, a tiny circle."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>


<p>
The same contemplative, concentrated, focused attention that H.D. invokes to suggest the possibility of a stable, undistracted relationship to the usually distracting cinematic image was itself understood during the early-twentieth century as closely related to the <i>breakdown</i> of stable vision, subjectivity, and identity. In a 1927 <i>Close Up</i> editorial, Kenneth Macpherson describes an entranced state of excessive visual fixation that he claims is the lamentable result of viewing inferior (most likely popular) films: "when the film is not good enough to keep the brain working, the public sinks into a kind of hypnotic daze. The screen, with its changing forms becomes something in the nature of a crystal, and the public in the nature of a crystal gazer. Mind in some way neatly obliterates itself."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 The state that Macpherson describes, one in which the absorbed, rapt gaze contributes to an obliteration or destabilizing of vision and subjectivity, resonates with Crary's notion of "suspension" as a salient quality of modern attention. Crary, drawing on the work of late-nineteenth-century psychologists, defines attentive suspension as "a looking or listening so rapt that it is an exemption from ordinary conditions, that it becomes a suspended temporality, a hovering out of time" (<i>SP,</i> 9). This is a state that blurs the distinction between concentration and the far more unpredictable and unmanageable states of reverie, trance, or dissociation. This fixated attention, verging on more trance-like states, involves both an intensification of 
<b></b>
perception and, <i>as a result</i> of this intensification, "a cancellation or an interruption . . . a disturbance, even a negation of perception itself" (<i>SP,</i> 10). Others during the first half of the twentieth century commented on this phenomenon, in which the intense stare actually limits and even disables perception. For example, Aldous Huxley noted that if through dependence on "artificial lenses or bad habits," the gaze grows too fixed and the eye loses its mobility, and thereby its ability to scan objects, "the sensory apparatus undergoes distortion and vision degenerates. . . . In his greedy anxiety to achieve his end, which is to the greatest possible amount of good seeing in the shortest possible time, the starer neglects the only means whereby this can be achieved."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>


<p>
The "crystal-gazer" with "bad habits" whose fixed stare borders on trance or cognitive dissociation makes frequent appearances in H.D.'s prose fiction of the 1920s. One example, from the novel <i>Asphodel,</i> demonstrates the kind of suspended attention that Crary describes: "Hermione stared at the wall. . . . Her eyes seemed to see nothing. Were open, staring like glass eyes, saw nothing, grey glass eyes, but her eyelids seemed pricked with luminous light, seemed to burn, to glow with some light within&#8212;<i>eyes and they see not</i>&#8212;her glass grey eyes didn't see anything, would never see anything" (<i>A,</i> 201).

<p>
In the fictional work that features this kind of hallucinatory suspended attention, the cause of this perceptual state is often related to a variety of lesbian desires and encounters. <i>(HER)mione, Asphodel,</i> and "Hipparchia" all represent lesbian relationships resembling those in H.D.'s own life (primarily her early relationship with Frances Gregg and her later relationship with Bryher). The texts describe these relationships not only in terms of vision, but also in terms of intense, rapt staring and shared hallucination and trance&#8212;states very similar to the suspended attention that marks Macpherson's "crystal-gazing" moviegoer. For example, in <i>Asphodel,</i> Hermione travels to France with her female lover, Fayne Rabb, and visits Rouen, the city where Joan of Arc was tried and executed. Hermione describes Joan in terms that echo late-nineteenth-century sexologists' definitions of the sexual invert&#8212;"a girl who was a boy"&#8212;and closely associates Joan's religious visions with Hermione's and Fayne's habit of "seeing things . . . having 'visions,' seeing things like she did and like Fayne Rabb."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 In fictional episodes that parallel H.D.'s first meeting with Bryher, the Bryher-like characters are repeatedly represented as intense starers equipped with "eyes that looked and looked" (<i>A,</i> 178; "H," 92, 94). Her protagonists respond not only by participating in a mutual, mirroring gaze ("staring back into eyes that stared and stared" [<i>A,</i> 175]; "regarding a pair of beryl eyes that looked and looked" ["H," 92]) but also by hallucination: "Don't let me get hysterical for she makes me see things" (<i>A,</i> 175, 180). I wish to suggest that it is precisely this kind of contradictory, suspended attention&#8212;rapt, fixated, and absorbed as well as destabilized and ungrounded&#8212;that emerges as a model for spectatorial subjectivity in H.D.'s film work, and it is one that is repeatedly associated with the literally entrancing effects of lesbian desire throughout H.D.'s oeuvre.

<p>
In her film writing, H.D. observes, admires, and attempts to represent and elicit such a state of entranced, suspended attention in her description of the photogenic, static aspects of Alexandra Khokhlova's performance in Lev Kuleshov's 1926 film <i>By the Law.</i> She writes:



<b></b>
<p>


<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The gestures of this woman are angular, bird-like, claw-like, skeleton-like and hideous. . . . Her gestures are magnificent. If this is Russian, then I am Russian. . . . this woman is a sort of bleak young sorceress, vibrant, febrile, neurotic . . . almost cataleptic. She has one authentic mad scene: her mind breaks after hours of watching the prisoner with the gun placed edge-wise like some iron bar-across numbed and frozen knees. . . . Her mind is on the raw edge of breaking. . . . Her mind, her soul, her body, her spirit, her being, all vibrate . . . almost audibly.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
As with the single images and pared-down stage sets that H.D. posits as the cinematic ideal, her admiration of this film is based on Khokhlova's static, "numbed and frozen" qualities&#8212;a stasis that borders, as she says, on catalepsis, and yet is also characterized by intense "vibration." As suggested in <a name="2" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#2">res 2</a> and <a name="3" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#3">3</a>, Khokhlova conveys this psychological condition through eyeball-exposing, rapt staring&#8212;images of which, like the image of H.D. staring into the camera in <i>Borderline,</i> remain on the screen for at least ten seconds. I would suggest that H.D. is not only admiring an actress' ability to represent the seemingly contradictory state of vibrant catalepsis; her film-related work also posits a model of spectatorial response that encompasses both qualities. H.D. offers herself as a model of just such a spectator when she explicitly identifies with Khokhlova's image ("if this is Russian, then I am Russian") and announces that "I, personally, am attuned to certain vibration" emanating from the screen, which, she claims, Kuleshov "uses . . . almost as a psychic medium" ("E," 127).

<p>
H.D.'s identification with Khokhlova's simultaneously vibrant and cataleptic screen image might be read not only as a model for spectatorial response, but even more specifically as a set of directions for viewing her <i>own</i> screen image. When H.D. saw <i>By the Law</i> in 1928, she had already appeared in <i>Wing Beat</i> and would act in two more POOL films <i>(Foothills</i> and <i>Borderline</i>) within the next two years. Images of H.D. in <i>Borderline</i> (<a name="1" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#1">. 1</a>, <a name="4" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#4">4</a>, <a name="5" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#5">5</a>, and <a name="6" href="9.3gallagher_res.html#6">6</a>) might easily be described with the same language she uses to describe Khokhlova: "angular, bird-like, claw-like, skeleton-like and hideous"; "vibrant, febrile, neurotic"; "almost cataleptic"; demonstrating "an agony of neurotic almost epileptic strength"; "a great locust, all legs, hardly any flesh" ("E," 128, 129).

<p>
H.D.'s focus on both the simultaneously static and vibrant aspects of Khokhlova's screen image also bears a striking resemblance to the language of a full-page advertisement in <i>Close Up</i> for the POOL group's 1927 film <i>Wing Beat</i>: "Telepathy and attraction, the reaching out, the very edge of dimensions in dimensions, the chemistry of actual attraction, of <i>will</i> shivering and quivering on a frail, too-high, too inaccessible brink. WING BEAT shakes and trembles from its first moment. . . . Of minds and spirits, not of persons."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Like H.D.'s description of Khokhlova, the rhapsodic language of the ad emphasizes both stasis and vibration. There is a dearth of active verbs and complete sentences, which are replaced mostly by a series of apposite nouns or noun phrases and gerunds. The verbs that <i>are</i> here (shivering, quivering, shakes, trembles) signal the most minute of movements, almost not movement at all, but rather something in between stasis and movement, perceived haptically or psychically, rather than visually.

<p>
H.D. uses a similar vocabulary of stasis and vibration in an unpublished essay on the film <i>Wing Beat:</i>

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
So the world beats and pulses in this modest four reel film. . . . But it is a world of reality, of a simple setting, a lyric setting and to all intents and purposes, no action. The action . . . is the action of subtle "stills," an action of thought etched in fine distinguished line on the fine distinguished features of Mr. Macpherson and of H.D., the writer, poet-critic who has taken part in the film. . . . This is the world lived by the nervous, post-war thinker, artist, intellectual; nerve-wrought, hysterical . . . but vibrant, pulsing with life and with rarefied emotion.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
In H.D.'s description of her own screen image, the only "action" is that of emotionally rarefied "stills," reminiscent of the significance-laden fixed tableaux of expressionist film melodramas. These nerve-wrought, hysterical, vibrant, pulsing "stills" also recall the nervous condition found in Walter Pater's description of the daughters of Herodias, oracular priestesses who, according to Eileen Gregory, served H.D. as models for the "visionary female artist": "Nervous, electric, faint always with some inexplicable faintness, these people seem to be subject to exceptional conditions, to feel powers at work in the common air unfelt by others" (qtd. in <i>HH,</i> 81).

<p>
The "film still" that constitutes the focus of female spectatorial identification here also makes an appearance in later feminist film theory's depiction of the gendered dichotomy of stasis and movement that adheres to the classical narrative film. Teresa DeLauretis describes this dichotomy when she claims that, "the female spectator is 
<b></b>
classically split between" on the one hand, identification with "the image on the screen, perceived as spatially static, fixed," and feminine, and on the other hand, "identification with the camera, apprehended as temporal, active," and masculine.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 H.D.'s description of the experience of working under Macpherson's direction in the making of <i>Borderline</i> clearly reflects this dichotomy, as Macpherson appears engaged in frantic directorial activity, arranging and posing his rather lumpish actors, including H.D. herself:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
He directs an elaborate series of overhead and side and ground lights, he writes a script which he meticulously illustrates with a series of some 1,000 pen sketches, he chooses his troop of players, he poses them, he all but acts for them, he directs from behind the camera while all the time he himself is concerned with the elaborate one-man mechanism of various stops, different focuses, indeterminate "pans" up and down, and the very tricky job of the sheer turning.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
It is clear that H.D.'s position as a film spectator and critic is heavily influenced by her experience as a film actor and by her (idealized) perceptions of her own screen image. It is tempting to read her act of looking at the vibrant/cataleptic woman on the screen as a form of extended, contemplative self-regard. The image of her looking at her own and other female images looking back at her via the camera would seem the apotheosis of Mary Ann Doane's description of the female spectator of classical Hollywood film, for whom "there is a certain overpresence of the image&#8212;she <i>is</i> the image" and whose "desire can be described only in terms of a kind of narcissism."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Understood in this way, H.D.'s rapt, absorbed gaze is at its most intensely absorbed when she is looking at her own screen image looking back at herself.

<p>
Such a narcissistic model of female spectatorship might present particular anxiety for a lesbian spectator, particularly one who, like H.D., was familiar with the work of sexologists like her and Bryher's friend Havelock Ellis, an early proponent of the association of the myth of Narcissus with autoeroticism and homosexuality.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 As Carolyn Allen has observed, the discourses of modern sexology "pathologize[d] the same-sex erotic dynamic as extreme self-enclosure under the rubric of narcissism." H.D.'s film-related writing evidences a dismayed awareness of the pejorative aspects of the "narcissist" construction of lesbian erotics, but it also offers a potentially redemptive revision of "narcissism" for a lesbian aesthetics of cinematic relations.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>


<p>
H.D.'s descriptions of her own domestic and sexual m&eacute;nage with Bryher and Macpherson, particularly her relationship to Bryher within the m&eacute;nage, evidence her concerns about the potentially stultifying, petrifying effects of both cinematic spectatorship and lesbian erotics.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 In a 1928 letter, she described her relationship with Bryher and Macpherson as "very static and 'classic,'" exactly the terms she uses to describe her ideal film aesthetic.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 However, this "static and classic" relation, especially with Bryher, is also marked by unease, visible in a set of metaphors describing the lesbian body as a machine, in particular a photographic machine. In the 1928 story "Narthex," which offers a fictional account of a trip H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson took to Venice around the time of Bryher's and Macpherson's marriage, H.D.'s protagonist
<b></b>
and fictional alter ego Raymonde describes her female lover Gareth as a "steel blue recorder" and complains to her male lover Daniel that "'Gareth is purely mechanical in all her reaction. . . . she sees me rather than perceives me. . . . She watches me . . . watching. She doesn't want to watch me absorbing. She wants to watch me watching.'"
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Gareth in this formulation <i>is</i> a film camera, engaged in a mechanical "seeing" rather than a more engaged "perceiving." Moreover, Raymonde suggests that Gareth's desire seeks to elicit a similar kind of mechanical vision&#8212;"watching" rather than "absorbing"&#8212;in Raymonde, portraying the two women as a pair of film cameras, mutually engaged in mechanical, inhuman vision.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>


<p>
In the pamphlet she wrote to accompany <i>Borderline,</i> H.D. also refers to Macpherson as a "machine man" whose body is coextensive with the camera he uses to shoot the film in which she and Bryher appear: "Kenneth Macpherson, at work, is a hard-boiled mechanic, as if he himself were all camera."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 However, this conflation of machine and male lover/film director appears as a productive hybridization of body and machine and seems to generate none of the dyslogistic associations of the mechanized Gareth, who is several times called a "robot" in H.D.'s 1928 fiction <i>The Usual Star.</i>
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 The concern about mechanistic vision, associated here particularly with lesbian relations, reflects an anxiety that, according to Louis Commoli, accompanied the rise of photography: "the human eye loses its immemorial privilege; the mechanical eye of the photographic machine now sees <i>in its place,</i> and in certain aspects with more sureness. The photograph stands as the triumph and grave of the eye."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 The image of the lesbian couple as a matched pair of film cameras suggests a completely mechanized narcissistic gaze, one in which the lesbian body itself serves as the "triumph and grave of the eye."

<p>
H.D.'s linking of the lesbian body to the narcissistic machinery of the camera and robot echoes her ambivalence about the rise of sound in cinema. Puzzling over her disappointment in a sound film starring the Spanish singer Raquel Meller, she claimed that "[t]he screen image, a mask, a sort of doll or marionette was somehow mechanized and robbed of the thing behind the thing that has grown to matter so much to the picture adept. A doll . . . became a sort of robot" ("CCM,"115). Although she is dealing here with a set of metaphors for the screen image quite different from classical statuary, the doll, like the marble statue, still retains a potentially revelatory quality, capable of granting to the "picture adept" access to "the thing behind the thing," the Platonic <i>eidos</i> lingering behind the <i>photog&eacute;nie</i> of the silent film image. The singing "robot," however, seems to close off this access, reducing the cinematic experience to a mere surface image. No depth, no absorption, no perception: only a superficial engagement with the readily reproducible mechanical entity and mechanically-generated image. Returning to Raymonde's complaint that "[s]he wants to watch me watching" as a dystopic mechanization of the dynamic of female lovers "staring back into eyes that stared and stared," we can read in H.D.'s work an anxiety about the specter of lesbian erotics as an endless mechanical <i>mise en ab&icirc;me,</i> reminiscent of the female spectator locked in a "narcissistic" engagement with the female screen image looking back at her.



<b></b>

<p>
H.D. reported with pleasure her engagement with film technology; she noted in her response to a 1929 <i>Little Review</i> questionnaire, "I myself have learned to use the small projector" and "can do a little work on the small camera."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 However, there lingers in her work a profound apprehension about the mechanical aspects of cinema&#8212;not only its "appliances" and "intricate machinery," but the mechanical generation and reproducibility of its images ("CCM,"114). This apprehension is linked in her writing to the pejorative sexological claims of narcissism that tend to gather around the lesbian body. H.D.'s emphasis on contemplative, even worshipful absorption in the film image, her suspicion of the cinematic "robot," and her valorization of the photogenic film image's ability to offer the "picture adept" access to the hermetic "thing behind the thing," participated in what Walter Benjamin perceived as a mistaken effort of film critics in the late 1920s to establish the "ritual" or "cult value" of the cinematic image, despite the fact that the mechanically-reproduced film image was detached from the "aura" of the "authentic," mechanically-unreproducible art work.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>


<p>
However, H.D.'s attempt to establish the cult value of the film image involved another agenda as well: rescuing lesbian desire from the damaging associations of narcissism, troped here not so much as self-reflection but rather as mechanical reproducibility. One method by which H.D. attempts to address and resolve her apprehension about the "robotic" aspects of lesbian desire involves her vibrant-cataleptic mode of film performance and reception. This method is closely connected to her recurrent valorization of the classical statue as the model not only for the cinematic image but for lesbian erotics. By describing lesbian desire in terms not only of the petrifying, narcissistic vision-machine or robot but rather in terms of the simultaneously static and vibrant classical statuary which forms the basis for her cinema aesthetic, she attempts to represent what Allen has described as a sexual "relation of identity layered with res of alterity," an erotics based on a shifting balance of identity and difference.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>


<p>
This kind of erotics is evidenced in the novel <i>(HER)mione,</i> composed in the late 1920s, when the protagonist Hermione (or Her), envisioning herself as a statue, conflates her own name both with the feminine object pronoun and her female lover: "Keep a marble self for a marble self, Her for Her, Her for Fayne exactly."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Several readers have observed that H.D. often associates classical statuary with lesbian sexuality, particularly lesbian sexuality understood as <i>both</i> homoerotic and autoerotic.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 The lesbian statuary that emerges here is not purely static, but also the animated, vibrant statuary of H.D.'s "restrained" cinematic ideal. An erotic encounter between Hermione and Fayne is described in terms of a cinematic experience, complete with curtains parting to reveal a screen close-up: "Her bent forward, face bent toward Her. A face bends toward me and a curtain opens. There is swish and swirl as of heavy parting curtains. . . . Curtains part as I look into the eyes of Fayne Rabb. 'And I&#8212;I'll make you breathe, my breathless statue.' 'Statue? You&#8212;<i>you</i> are the statue.'"
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>


<p>
With its heavy-breathing (or at least the promise of heavy-breathing) sexual rapport between the closely-identified female spectator and the female image, both of whom are characterized as "statues" animated by their cinematic/sexual encounter, this passage 
<b></b>
suggests the sort of "picture adept" H.D. is attempting to model in her film writing. The female spectator thereby engages autoerotically <i>and</i> homoerotically with a female screen image that is both self and other, static and animated, or, like Khokhlova's and H.D.'s own screen image, cataleptic and vibrant. H.D.'s simultaneously contemplative and distracted or "suspended" stare at the female screen image that is both self and other anticipates Roland Barthes's claim that "Photography is the advent of myself as other" and indicates her contribution to modernist women's theorizing of lesbian desire in the age of mechanical reproduction.

"I take it in retrospect that my tendency to action had effects," Ezra Pound asserted in his radio broadcast on the vorticist journal <i>BLAST,</i> "and that the vast majority of the small minority into contact with which I came, was uneasy, disturbed, horrified in fact: for that sign of action was also some sort of a harbinger."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 His repeated reference to action, and to the effects of an active presence in literary language, was anything but incidental. The avant-garde satires that he had published in June 1914 were indeed a harbinger of increasingly polemical poems, and his Hell Cantos (numbers 14 and 15), drafted in the spring and summer of 1922, inaugurated an extreme style of poetic invective in which words were crafted as weapons and images designed to wound. Taken together in their own historical moment, the Hell Cantos represent the highest stage of development in Pound's discursive battle with modernity's monopolists following his retreat 
<b></b>
from London in January 1921.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 As he refined his efforts to express his "<i>impersonal</i> indignation" at those forces that had effectively exiled him&#8212;and that he felt were obstructing, obfuscating, and obscuring what was best in postwar culture and society&#8212;the polemical poetic that had begun its evolution with <i>BLAST</i> ultimately came to test the limits of aesthetic representation.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 These poems, through their almost visual and certainly visceral effects, are the first to conform fully to the etymology of polemic's Greek root, <i>polemos,</i> as "war." And yet Pound did not wage war (only) on the now-familiar political and economic targets, nor had his mode of assault yet been marred by fascistic or anti-Semitic rhetoric. Rather, he directed his counterstrike against

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
those who had lied for hire;

<br />
the perverts, the perverters of language,

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the perverts, who have set money lust

<br />
Before the pleasures of the senses. . . .
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<p>
My analysis of Pound's polemic tracks a proliferation of modes of linguistic assault and means of attributing enemies that begins with <i>BLAST</i> and culminates in <i>A Draft of XVI. Cantos toward a Poem of Some Length</i> (and that later devolves into the diatribes of <i>Jefferson and/or Mussolini</i> and the incendiary broadcasts from Radio Rome). By paying particular attention first to the ways in which verbal invective works, and then to the process by which enemies were singled out for various kinds of assaults, we can discover much about the trajectory of Pound's career in London, Paris, and Rapallo. That is to say, while an attraction to polemic need not lead indelibly to racial intolerance, economic determinism, or political extremism, in this case it demonstrably encouraged the last at the very least.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 It also contributed to some less predictable developments. Some of the surprises that attend Pound's sense of what constitutes an "enemy" bear on received versions of literary and cultural histories alike. The isolation of G. K. Chesterton as the model for the unserious artist was the first of a series of oppositions to persons, institutions, and ideals by which Pound defined himself throughout his life. Chesterton was Pound's first public enemy in the field of cultural production. His eventual replacement in that role by T. S. Eliot&#8212;in the guise of "Possum Episcopus"&#8212;recommends a closer look at perhaps the most celebrated collaboration between two poets in the twentieth century, that involving the editing and marketing of <i>The Waste Land.</i> The uncelebrated Hell Cantos, in which <i>The Waste Land</i> is parodied and Eliot appears not once but twice, are therefore a singularly important resource for the discovery of what those oppositions were and what they were not. The evolution of these oppositions parallels and informs Pound's program for poetry during the crucial period of 1914-22, and it is, by implication, a vital part of the story of high modernism.

<p>
As a literary form, polemic sometimes resembles the satirical and sometimes the obscene, but it is different from both and more potent than either. These differences can, however, at times, be subtle. For example, a relatively fluid continuum does exist between Pound's sense of his own avant-garde "satire," which may be defined as both a spirit and an art, and his purer polemic, which intensifies satire's oppositional spirit 
<b></b>
even as it breaks with a number of the formal characteristics of its art. Indeed, Pound himself continued to refer to all of his oppositional poetry as satiric long after his poems quit conforming to any conventional generic or historical understanding of postclassical satire.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 In the so-called satirical poems published in <i>BLAST,</i> he was already straining against the limits of those written in the vein of the great eighteenth-century British satirists. He acknowledged that the modern impulse toward concreteness, specificity, and direct presentation was at odds with this British tradition, claiming "that Hubridas, Pope, even Crabbe all take us to a dated world, to a past state of England."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 He further realized that the "unexpectedness of even a very good joke is bound to wear off on the fifth or sixth reading," and concluded that satiric wit "wears off in just the measure that it is 'abstract,' general statement or comment, and not particular presentation" (<i>ABCR,</i> 165). His disparagement of the inefficacy and transience of generality prevented the majority of his own satires (with a few notable exceptions, such as "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley" and "Homage to Sextus Propertius") from being truly satirical.

<p>
The <i>BLAST</i> poems, Pound felt, compensated for the shortcomings of traditional English-language satire by being as affective and enduring as they were precise. To this end, he contended that with them it had become a crucial "part of his position . . . that one should name names in satire."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 But Pound resolutely denied that those indictments conveyed any animosity. His later tendency to express <i>impersonal</i> indignation as personal animosity was limited not only in the 1910s but also through the 1920s (and even the better part of the 1930s) precisely because he still knew then what he seemed later to forget: "contempt may not be a very formidable weapon" (<i>L,</i> 116). The desire to hurt&#8212;to conduct a directed assault with malice aforethought, using language as a weapon&#8212;is the defining characteristic of polemic, and also what bars the polemicist from asserting the satirist's license of social improvement or ethical instruction.

<p>
In modernity, the primary difference between obscenity and polemic is that while the latter may at times appear to be obscene in the broadest sense of that word, it is never lascivious. Polemical texts are in this way fundamentally different from those such as D. H. Lawrence's novel <i>The Rainbow</i> , Wyndham Lewis's short story "Cantleman's Spring Mate" (published in the October 1917 issue of the <i>Little Review</i>), or the "Nausicaa" section of James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> (serialized in the September 1920 issue of the same journal), all of which were suppressed as sexually subversive material. At a time when obscenity presented a real and present occasion for censorship, Pound recognized the necessity of making a distinction between the obscene and the polemical. He made this distinction himself as part of a (failed) attempt to persuade his publisher to include a number of the "harsh" poems from <i>BLAST</i> in <i>Lustra</i> , arguing that those poems were "written in the speech of the best English classics," whereas Lawrence's recently banned novel had "depended for its sale precisely on its sexual overloading."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>


<p>
Based in part on this distinction between violent representations and sexual ones (which loses some of its distinctiveness toward the end of the twentieth century), the polemical, like but unlike the obscene, can be understood as that which cannot be 
<b></b>
publicized without risk. Any attempt to identify and assault an enemy leaves the artist and publisher vulnerable to harm in return, either by that enemy or by the criminal justice system. The risks that attend such an attack help to explain why, in regard to what he referred to as poetry's "premeditated thrust," Pound took care to explain to the University of Pennsylvania's Felix E. Schelling, "I don't think one ought to hurt <i>unless one means to</i>" (<i>L,</i> 179; emphasis added). Moreover, in reference to his own thrusts, he conceded to his former teacher a notion of using poems as "shock troops," asserting that "[t]here are things I quite definitely want to destroy, and which I think will have to [be] annihilated before civilization can exist, i.e. anything I can dignify with the title civilization. . . " (<i>L,</i> 181). Even for a controversial poet frequently accused of being everything from a cynic to a crank, this is an unconventional way to think about civilization.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>


<p>
As weapons, or as shock troops, Pound's polemics depend upon the capacity for <i>objective predication</i> in poetic language. This type of predication, in the polemical context, describes the process by which words and images act upon a reader through the activation of language and attribution of enemies. It does so through a "transference of power," based on highly charged diction and imagery, that "appeal[s] to emotions with . . . direct impression, flashing through regions where the intellect can only grope."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 For Pound, this process offered the modern poet who could master it an opportunity to write beyond the "painted adjectives" that had "imped[ed] the shock and stroke" of Victorian and Edwardian poetry; in this style, publication became a form of public action.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>


<p>
Polemic transmits the most extreme emotions and associations in the most visceral fashion available to an artist. This active force of language, though rarely denied outright, has proved notoriously difficult for scholars to define.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Poets occasionally do better. Much of Pound's early critical prose (c. 1911-3) evinces his desire, often couched in medical, mechanical, or mathematical terms, to understand how the power of objective predication can affect a reader both intellectually and emotionally. For example, in February 1912, ten years before he finished editing Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i> and began drafting his own Hell Cantos, Pound hypothesized that the poetry of "the next decade or so . . . will be harder" and that "its force will lie in its truth" ("P," 12). He began to extend these speculations to include the sociopolitical and even material force of representational language at the end of that decade. Herbert Schneidau has determined that Pound's goal was to "register an image of a thing so active and alive that '[a reader] cannot distinguish between the thing and its image'"; this is nothing less, he claims, than a call "for a poetry of transubstantiation, for the real presence in the symbolic medium."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 The poet's own theory of such a real presence began to coalesce in its most familiar form soon after he was entrusted with the late Ernest Fenollosa's notebooks in 1913. These notebooks facilitated his development of an "alive and plastic" (sometimes esemplastic) style that "corresponds to [the] universal form of action in nature" and therefore "brings language close to <i>things</i>" (<i>CWC,</i> 17, 13). In this sense, Pound's Fenollosan inheritance provides a foundation for the further analysis of objective predication, or the incorporation of real, active, living elements, in his poems.



<b></b>

<p>

In accord with his increasingly polemical poetics, Pound characterized his new vorticist movement&#8212;in contradistinction to both imagism and futurism&#8212;as "an intensive art," by which he meant an art of "<i>dynamic</i>" expressions rather than merely "emphatic" ones that are "yelled louder."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Moreover, he proclaimed that this kind of representational language possesses a degree of "abnormal vigour" foreign to other genres: "Poetry=Emotional synthesis."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Pierre Bourdieu proves himself well attuned to this special power of poetry which, he asserts, "manifests to the highest degree, when it is successful, the effect which consists in awakening experiences."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Perhaps an unexpected ally, the sociologist of language confirms that the poetic, as the most refined and condensed language act, is properly understood as the "limiting case" of all such acts precisely because it "aim[s] to transmit emotions."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 And in this, at least, Pound and Bourdieu clearly agree: while it may not be the most persuasive art, poetry is, or can be, the most painful.

The Enemy : G. K. Chesterton
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
To consolidate his intellectual, aesthetic, and cultural positions, Pound needed to find or create an enemy, a personal and professional opposite against whom he could publicly define himself. From a field of candidates that included "fakes like Shaw, stew like Wells, [and] nickle cash-register Bennett," he concluded that Edwardian belletrist Gilbert Keith Chesterton had distinguished himself as the man for whom objective, enduring, precise language seemed to mean the least (<i>L,</i> 296). No longer highly regarded in the academy today, Chesterton had, by the time Pound arrived in London, already attained substantial fame and even a little wealth as a man of letters who had revised Oscar Wilde's dictum, "Anything worth doing is worth doing well," to "Anything worth doing is worth doing badly." Only eleven years Pound's senior, he was building a reputation on the qualities of paradox and abstraction, "degrading the values" of serious literature.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 As troubling as this was to the younger poet, however, his reaction against Chesterton was not a personal one. He was, he claimed, reacting instead against an example of a <i>kind</i> of artist that "creates a milieu in which art is impossible," and even admitted that his reaction may have been "heightened by a feeling that I should probably like G.K.C. personally if I ever met him" (<i>L,</i> 117). From the beginning, Pound viewed the re of the enemy not as a personal foe but as a public rival. This will be important to remember as his concept of the enemy develops.

<p>
While Chesterton's extraliterary commitments were closer to Pound's than the latter could appreciate, at least in his youth, even the most enthusiastic Chestertonians long ago came to terms with the reality that Chesterton's "was a life in Fleet Street as well as a life of the mind."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Chesterton was, by profession, a journalist. Biographer and advocate Maisie Ward acknowledges that the "serious attacks" launched by Chesterton and his journalistic colleagues at the <i>New Witness</i> (a journal then edited by Gilbert's younger brother, Cecil, and later rechristened <i>G. K.'s Weekly</i>) were undermined by their use of "humour[,] sometimes degenerating into wild fooling, [which] damned them in the eyes of many."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Pound's objection reiterates this biographical 
<b></b>
observation as cultural critique: "the <i>never</i> taking a hedge straight" but instead "dodging behind clumsy fun and paradox" is, he claimed, "slop" (<i>L,</i> 116). Worse still, from Pound's perspective, Chesterton and the staff of the <i>New Witness</i> did not restrict themselves to the pages of a single journal. As Chesterton observed of himself, his brother, and Hilaire Belloc in the pages of A. R. Orage's <i>The New Age</i> (a favorite venue of Pound's), "We can't write in every paper at once," adding, presumably earnestly, "We do our best."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 This attitude prompted Pound, in his first Hell Canto, to damn Chesterton as the leader of London's "press gang" (14/61)&#8212;as opposed to its more traditionally literary poetry "gangs" that he himself had labored to join prior to forming the avant-garde vorticist gang with Wyndham Lewis.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>


<p>
Pound contrasts the artist's and journalist's relationships to the <i>&#156;grum vulgus</i> (sick crowd) in "The Serious Artist" . There he notes, entirely critically, that "the public so dear to the journalistic heart" is "far more concerned with the shareholders of the Marconi company" than with "the abstract mathematicians who worked out the determinants that Marconi made use of in his computations for the wireless telegraph."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 When the essay was published this was a transparent reference to a scandal popularly known as "Ministers Gambling in Marconis." The scandal, which had been covered (or instigated) by the <i>New Witness,</i> resulted in the implicated ministers bringing a well-publicized and successful libel suit against the Chestertons and assorted other New Witnesses.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 And yet the significance of the occasion, for Pound, had less to do with the scandal or the trial than with the "immoral" readiness to pander to a sick crowd, a misdeed for which he claimed an artist "should be punished or despised in proportion to the seriousness of his offense" ("SA," 43, 44). Chesteron's willingness to pander in this fashion fixed him in Pound's mind as not only a member of "the mob, the multitude" but also as "a symbol for the mob's hatred of all art that aspires above mediocrity" (<i>L,</i> 116). It rendered him as a type, as the original unserious artist. Although the serious artist was not yet prepared to name the public enemy publicly, an informed contemporary reader would easily have picked this up.

<p>
Pound published his first overt assault upon a public enemy the following year in the first issue of <i>BLAST</i>. There he invoked Chesterton, by name, in a two-line poem written in the epigrammatic style of the better known "In a Station of the Metro." Unlike those nameless, faceless apparitions on that wet, black bough, however, the subject of "The New Cake of Soap" is exposed explicitly:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Lo, how it gleams and glistens in the sun
<br />
Like the cheek of a Chesterton.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>



<p>
Pound associates this type of "<i>hokku</i>-like" "one-image poem" with vorticism and identifies it as a new form in the West that "record[s]," better than any previous form had, "the precise instant when a thing outward and objective transforms itself, or darts into a thing inward and subjective" ("V," 89). In the instant of transformation, the enemy attains a new degree of referential specificity without losing his status as a type as the use of the indefinite article, "<i>a</i> Chesterton," renders his (objective) proper name into 
<b></b>
a (subjective) term of derogation. The transformation also compels consideration on the reader's part, not only of the relationship between the individual and the type, but also of which "cheek" is gleaming and glistening, how that image of exposure works, and what work it can perform.

<p>
While it may perhaps appear to have been dashed off in an idle moment, "The New Cake of Soap" was, to Pound, a far more serious undertaking than that appearance would suggest. Neither among Pound's greatest poems nor an independently stable foundation for a poetics, it is nevertheless a fine example of a number of theories put forth in such crucial essays as "The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Art," "A Few Don'ts," "The Serious Artist," and "Vorticism." Moreover, Pound himself referred to the poem as "a sharp thrust" that aspired to kill (his term) "the multitude of [Chesterton's] mumblings"&#8212;or more realistically, as "even that won't do it," to purge his own soul (<i>L,</i> 116). Not only did he contend that his polemical assault on Chesterton had in fact purged his soul, but he also reported, several years later, that it had performed on its broader readership "a work of purgation of minds, meritorious as the physical products of Beecham" (<i>L,</i> 181-2). He ultimately felt, as I will demonstrate, that this first attempt at publication as public action marked the beginning of a shift in his own poetics.

<p>
Pound's faith in the condensed precision of "The New Cake of Soap" led him to make a series of appeals on its behalf that could easily seem as far out of scale as of character. The significance he ascribed to that little poem can be gauged best by his frenetic efforts to have it reprinted in the trade edition of <i>Lustra</i> .
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 "It is nonsense," he told Elkin Mathews, his reluctant publisher, "to imagine that there can be trouble over poems which have already appeared not only in England but in America which . . . is supposedly much more silly and prudish and uninformed," and justified his style by asserting, "I do not write as that pandar to public imbecilities Mr. Chesterton. . ." (<i>P/J,</i> 278). Mathews was not moved. Only after Pound had come to realize that the poem could reappear in an unexpurgated second run of 200 copies did he finally claim, too late to be convincing, that he did not "want to be hysterical over two lines."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>


<p>
Acerbic or visionary, the structural condensation of the one-image poem demands nothing more than tension, and the title "The New Cake of Soap" is no less relevant to its poem than the title "In a Station of the Metro" is to its. A complex noun form, however, stands in a different relation to the poem than does a prepositional phrase, which is more likely to situate a reader in a comparatively straightforward manner. As to the less straightforward relation of a Chesterton to a new cake of soap, Pound provides a clue in a statement about poetic diction: "Consider," he asks readers of "A Few Don'ts," "the way of the scientists rather than the way of an advertising agent for a new soap" . The essay makes explicit the distinction between the precision and concreteness of science and the ambiguity and descriptiveness of advertisement copy. This descriptiveness often requires a degree of ingenuity in order to emphasize trivial differences between nearly indistinguishable products, like a new soap and an old one. But the ingenuity it requires is not that of the serious artist.



<b></b>

<p>

That Pound should have drawn an important cultural distinction in these terms is less unlikely than it may seem, as soap advertisements had become remarkably common in both England and America even before the turn of the twentieth century. Relevant examples include the 500-page almanac first distributed by Lever Brothers to users of "Sunlight Soap" in 1896 and the series of Procter &amp; Gamble booklets, even more applicable to "The New Cake of Soap," entitled "What a Cake of Soap Will Do."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Directly distributed by retailers to consumers, the latter faux-art booklets juxtaposed poems and line drawings to call attention to what the company identified as the most pressing issues of the day. The panegyric squibs that filled these booklets&#8212;all earnestly dedicated to the powers of the "Cake of Soap," all in thuddingly regular iambic tetrameter couplets&#8212;worked to numb the mind so that they might then instruct (or cleanse) it. Almost as committed to pedagogy as he was to poetry, Pound would surely have found the proselytizing thrust of these slight yet massive advertisements especially egregious. Consider, for example, the conversion narrative "Reclaimed," an anonymous advertisement-poem that applauds the civilizing effects a cake of soap can have on Native Americans (from the indigenous point of view, no less):

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We once were factious, fierce and wild,

<br />
To peaceful arts unreconciled;

<br />
Our blankets smeared with grease and stains

<br />
From buffalo meat and settlers' veins.

<br />
Through summer's dust and heat content,

<br />
From moon to moon unwashed we went;

<br />
But Ivory Soap came like a ray

<br />
Of light across our darkened way.

<br />
And now we're civil, kind and good

<br />
And keep the laws as people should.

<br />
We wear our linen, lawn and lace,

<br />
As well as folks with paler face.

<br />
And now I take, where'er we go,

<br />
This cake of Ivory Soap to show

<br />
What civilized my squaw and me

<br />
And made us fair and clean to see. [<a name="1" href="9.3hofer_res.html#1"> 1</a>]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Then consider it in relation to the opening of Chesterton's similarly unsubtle "The New Freethinker," which describes the growth of "Grubby," an already "civilized" protagonist who refuses a rather different sort of conversion:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
John Grubby, who was short and stout

<br />
And troubled with religious doubt,

<br />
Refused about the age of three

<br />
To sit upon the curate's knee;

<br />
(For so the eternal strife must rage

<br />
Between the spirit of the age

<br />
And Dogma, which, as is well known,

<blockquote>

<p>
To justify Pound's ambition, the single couplet of "The New Cake of Soap" should prove equally superior to the verse industrial product and to the verse of its Edwardian representative. Not only are the interminable couplets of "Reclaimed" and "The New Freethinker" metrically indistinguishable from one poem to the other, but there can be little doubt that both of these sprawling poems lack the pithy dynamic intensity that Pound privileged in vorticism. Hugh Kenner's critical assessment of Chesterton's poetry in 
<b></b>
the otherwise favorable <i>Paradox in Chesterton</i>  is that "Chesterton never achieves a great poem because his poems are compilations of statements not intensely felt but only intensely meant."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 And although Chesterton's poem may at least claim the advantage of his notorious wit&#8212;it is, after all, funny, in its way&#8212;it exhibits a kind of humor that leaves little trace on the reader after the reading has ended. Or if the poem does make a sensible impact, then that impact would be closer to the numbing tendency of the soap-advertisement poem than to the stimulating one of Pound's avant-garde polemic.

<p>
Rather than numbing the faculties in preparation for instruction or conversion, the rhythm and rhyme of Pound's poem aspire to induce an emotional correlation with its sense. Toward this end, the combination of the dactyl "of the sun" and the anapest "Chesterton" not only generates a barely perceptible off-rhyme, but the act of binding the two together in a couplet results in an awkward rhyme that is neither quite masculine nor quite feminine. Most who read the poem aloud will, in an effort to achieve the regularity anticipated of the couplet form, distort not the prepositional phrase in the first line (where only the object, sun, receives a stress), but rather the proper name in the second (by stressing the otherwise unstressed syllable "ton"). This forces "Chesterton" into an unfamiliar, masculine, dactylic shape. The design of the poem thus ensures that its recitation will either subtly invert the gender of the otherwise masculine rhyme by conforming to a conventional pronunciation of the well-known name or else deform the name itself. In both cases, Chesterton comes out badly. Moreover, all the other words in the poem that bear significant weight of meaning&#8212;"gleams," "glistens," "sun," and "cheek"&#8212;are derived from Old English and have rich Germanic roots that throw into relief a state of British arts and letters so diminished that it can be represented adequately by a Chesterton. When a self-proclaimed avant-gardiste begins a self-consciously modern poem with a dated, superfluous, and clich&eacute;d interjection ("Lo"), that choice directs attention to the nineteenth-century origins of the poem's two alliterative predicates ("glistens" and "gleams") by which it works upon its two alliterative nominatives ("cheek" and "Chesterton"). Finally, the colloquial definition of "cheek" as "impudence or insolence" also originated in the nineteenth century, "a rather sentimentalistic, mannerish sort of a period"&#8212;just as, the poem implies, did Chesterton himself.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>


<p>
The barely perceptible difference between an object that gleams and another that glistens further illuminates objective predication as the polemical activation of language. For in this poem's single predicate-driven image, the "it" that is in apposition to both the cake of soap and Chesterton "gleams" with "emitted or reflected light" and "glistens" with "a fitful twinkling light." Pound's choice of two verbs&#8212;one semi-transitive, the other intransitive, both with nominal and adjectival forms&#8212;that refer to qualities of shining has implications that reflect back to "The Chinese Written Character." In that essay Fenollosa contrasts the Chinese ideograph "<i>ming</i> or <i>mei</i>" (the sign of the sun together with the sign of the moon), which productively "serves as verb, noun, adjective," with the roughly equivalent intransitive verb "to shine," which leads, he claims, to thinking that is "extremely abstract, too intangible for use" (<i>CWC,</i> 17, 18). 
<b></b>
By this contrast he wishes to demonstrate that the ideograph, unlike the verb in the infinitive, permits "no possible confusion of the real meaning, though a stupid scholar may spend a week trying to decide what 'part of speech' he should use in translating a very simple and direct thought from Chinese to English" (<i>CWC,</i> 18). Pound's addition of a rare footnote that corrects this usage and analysis with reference to the German language (and the tradition of Germanic philology) renders Fenollosa's example increasingly suggestive for his own meditation on shining in "The New Cake of Soap." "A good writer would use 'shine' (i.e. to shine), 'shining,' and 'the shine' or 'sheen,' possibly thinking of the German <i>'sch&ouml;ne'</i> and <i>'Sch&ouml;nheit,'</i>" he respectfully suggests, "but this does not invalidate Professor Fenollosa's contention" (ibid.).

<p>
The choices that Pound describes for a "good writer" are remarkably similar to those that determine the diction of a serious artist's poem. They also help to elucidate the essay's larger contention that he had gone out of his way to respect, which is that separate parts of speech cannot exist in the world without relation to each other and therefore are not conducive to the transference of force in representational language. Since in this schema all parts of speech <i>do something,</i> and since each word is defined and determined by what it <i>does,</i> Fenollosa posits that "we attain for a moment the inner heat of thought, a heat which melts down the parts of speech to recast them at will" at just that transformative moment "when the difficulty of placing some odd term arises" (<i>CWC,</i> 17). The juxtaposition of "gleams" and "glistens" causes Chesterton's "cheek"&#8212;which is itself an odd term, difficult to place&#8212;to shift rapidly among its various meanings, suggesting in turn "the chops," "the buttocks," and also the sense of "impudence or insolence" that I have already noted. Thus the central analogy in this vorticist poem ("like the cheek") functions not, in the terms of "A Few Don'ts," as bad ornament or an indirect treatment of a thing, but instead generates, in the terms of "The Serious Artist," the perception of "a swiftness, almost a violence, and certainly a vividness" ("SA," 52).

<p>
The poem's most innovative accomplishment, its memorable and enduring image of "a Chesterton," superimposes on the reader's consciousness the multiple "cheeks" of its subject's face, buttocks, and style (no doubt a particularly effective strategy in reference to a litterateur of such storied girth). All three meanings combine in the poem to represent a greasy flaccidity that characterizes not only Chesterton's corpulence but also his accumulated literary output. Approached with an appreciation of the nuances of philology and a rudimentary knowledge of the soap-making process&#8212;a process that should throw onto a reader's visual imagination an image of rendered fat&#8212;the logic of Pound's poem renders both of Chesterton's corpora, that of his body and that of his language, as corpses. When Fenollosa exclaims, "Fancy picking up a man and telling him that he is a noun, a dead thing rather than a bundle of functions!" he captures exactly what Pound fancies himself doing in "The New Cake of Soap," which effects a reverse transubstantiation of a living name into a dead thing, a bundle of functions, or an epithet (<i>CWC,</i> 16).

<p>
While Pound practices this type of sophisticated and vulgar condensation first in "The New Cake of Soap," he later employs variants of it to good&#8212;more accurately, to 
<b></b>
ill&#8212;effect in more fully elaborated polemics, most notably in the Hell Cantos and the Purgatorio Canto (number 16). The first Hell Canto, for example, opens with a comparatively lengthy depiction of the politicians Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson,

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
. . . their wrists bound to

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their ankles,

<br />
Standing bare bum,

<br />
Faces smeared on their rumps,

<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wide eye on flat buttock,

<br />
Bush hanging for beard,

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing the multitudes through their arse holes. . . .

<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[14/61]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<p>
The second Hell Canto summons a similar flatulent image, one that confounds the very possibility of meaningful verbal discourse, in the form of

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
endless rain from the arse-hairs,

<br />
as the earth moves, the centre

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passes over all parts in succession,

<br />
a continual bum-belch

<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distributing its productions.

<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[15/65]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The Hell Cantos combat precisely this kind of Chestertonian unchecked distribution on a larger scale, just as they combat its obverse in the form of "monopolists, obstructors of knowledge / obstructors of distribution" (14/63). As with Chesterton's "cheek," the image in the first poem compels a reader to see "faces" alternately as themselves and as "faeces," and the one in the second registers the "belch" of the "bum" unmistakable as both an eructation and a flatus. In each instance a marker of identity (a name, a face, a voice) is transformed into a general debasement of it.

<p>
The related Purgatorio Canto works slightly differently. In it the predicative effect attains a degree of temporal contingency, which Fenollosa might have justified through his observations that the "transferences of force from agent to object . . . occupy time" and that the "reproduction of them in imagination requires the same temporal order" (<i>CWC,</i> 7). Here the phonetic resources of poetic language are developed to make <i>angel</i> more closely mimic <i>anus</i> in a description putatively offered by "the old admiral," Algernon Percy, of the face of the poet, George Gordon, Lord Byron:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Byron

<br />
Dead drunk, with the face of an A y n. . . . . . . .

<br />
He pulled it out long, like that:

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the face of an a y n . . . . . . . . gel

<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[16/71]
<b></b>

</blockquote>






<p>

Yet all of these variously charged images&#8212;which I will define here as "multistable" poetic images&#8212;ultimately use the resources of representational language to bring together surprisingly (sometimes shockingly) disparate forms.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 The result is essentially the same for the one-image poem as it is for the above examples from the cantos: in each instance one aspect of the image can be perceived before its referentiality shifts within its given frame. Sometimes in rapid succession, sometimes over a longer span, the various aspects of these multistable images are never quite available to the reader simultaneously.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>


<p>
The ideal polemically-charged multistable poetic image, not yet achieved, would keep both readings active in a perpetual state of transformation. The function of the name/epithet is privileged in the vorticist one-image poem, however, because it comes so relatively close to allowing a reader to perceive two states (the objective and the subjective) in what Pound called the "precise instant" of transformation, what Fenollosa called the "moment [of] the inner heat of thought." Thus a poem like "The New Cake of Soap" conducts its assault not through its "obscenity" but rather through its combination of precise attribution and dynamic predication. It therefore constitutes the poet's first attempt to throw symbolic objects onto his readers' visual imaginations with real force.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The hurt he meant to do was neither incidental nor immaterial.

Recoverable Identities and Palimpsestic Blanks

<p>
"Satire, my dear Homer; SATIRE!!! Wotcher mean by satire?!?" was Pound's incredulous reply to his father's praise of his polemical cantos as a masterful example of the satirist's art.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 Whatever he might have believed about "The New Cake of Soap," he knew that the violent imagery, diction, and tone of poems like the Hell Cantos were by no means defensible as what he had previously called "clean cut satire" (<i>P/J,</i> 282). In 1914 he had been no more prepared to make the horrors appear horrible than he was certain how best to address public enemies publicly; by 1922, however, he had made significant progress on both fronts. This is when he demands to know, "If the poets don't make certain horrors appear horrible who will?" and answers that hypothetical question with real conviction: "Humanity is malleable mud, and the arts set the moulds it is later cast into. Until the cells of humanity recognize certain things as excrement, they will stay in [the] human colon and poison it" (<i>L,</i> 181). His "Paris Letter" for May stakes out a new defense for this new poetic:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The <i>mot juste</i> is of public utility. I can't help it. I am not offering this fact as a sop to aesthetes who want all authors to be fundamentally useless. We are governed by words, the laws are graven in words, and literature is the sole means of keeping these words living and accurate. The specimen of fungus given in my February letter [the text of Section 211 of the U.S. Penal Code] shows what happens to language when it gets into the hands of illiterate specialists.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
<b></b>

</blockquote>








<p>
This statement finally expresses how the practical value of poetic language corresponds to the polemical ideal of intense, dynamic, living words. But living words, when they aim to kill, engender a fresh set of problems for the poet and critic, and those problems most notably pertain to the attribution of proper names.

<p>
Although it stems from numerous cultures and historical periods, Pound's thinking about attribution in <i>The Cantos</i> coheres around his appreciation of ancient China. As the Confucius Canto (number 13) demonstrates, the <i>Analects</i> provided him with an understanding of Ch&ecirc;ng Ming, the principle of the rectification of names; this Eastern concept of right naming, along with the Western concept of the <i>mot juste,</i> combined to shape the aesthetic and political dimensions of his mature art.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Yet that canto also demonstrates that he felt no less strongly about deferring pronouncements when names are not yet known. This, too, is imperative in right naming. He thus quotes approvingly Confucius's nostalgic reminiscence in the <i>Analects</i> of "A day when the historians left blanks in their writings, / I mean for things they didn't know" (13/60). An analysis of the elisions of names in Pound's Hell requires attention to the concept of Ch&ecirc;ng Ming, the ultimate expression of fidelity to language, which is the missing quality that identifies all Betrayers, Perverters, and Liars as such. As Pound identifies the unserious artist as one who "falsifies his report" "out of deliberate will to lie, . . . out of carelessness, out of laziness, out of cowardice, out of any sort of negligence whatsoever," Carroll Terrell's <i>A Companion to the Cantos of Ezra Pound</i> glosses the Hell Cantos' phrase "betrayers of language" as representing "the falisfiers, who include impersonators and liars," adding, "To use words sloppily or carelessly (the opposite of Ch&ecirc;ng Ming) is bad enough but, in Pound's ethics, to betray the word with malice aforethought is one of the ultimate sins."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>


<p>
The question, then, is whether Pound's own reluctance to spell out the names of those he condemns in the Hell Cantos ultimately constitutes a violation of the principle of the rectification of names. And it might, perhaps, if the cantos did not also demonstrate that the serious artist's true obligation, beyond keeping fitting names in circulation, entails keeping corrupted names out of it. This realization compelled him to reconsider his position on naming, and resulted in his abrupt adoption of an elided&#8212;but recoverable&#8212;form of identity for the Hell Cantos, thus marking a major change from his avant-garde satires as well as his later diatribes. By choosing to forgo the kind of explicit attribution he had championed in "The New Cake of Soap" in favor of imperfectly elided proper names, he voluntarily introduced a series of palimpsestic blanks into poems that depend on a reader's simultaneous sense that <i>both</i> specific individuals <i>and</i> abstract types are being condemned. According to Pound, only the poet, the professional practitioner of the living language, possesses knowledge and power sufficient to adjudicate in such cases. Indeed, for much of the 1920s and 1930s he considered himself just such a judge of the living and the dead, characterizing himself as "the last living Rhadmanthus . . . who calls down the mighty from their seats (and then watches 'em clinging to the tacks in the upholstery)".
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>


<p>
To justify his concession of proper names in the Hell Cantos as a poetic strategy, Pound claimed that his "point" was "that not even the first but only last letters of their 
<b></b>
names had resisted corruption" (<i>L,</i> 293). He goes on to say that Bill Bird, whose Three Mountains Press published the deluxe first edition of <i>A Draft of XVI. Cantos,</i> had "entertained that I had forgotten which rotters were there" but nevertheless "tried to get the number of . . . . . . . [ellipses] correct in each case."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 While it is true that very little that is personal remains in these poems, the poet does indict specific persons. The first edition's accurate retention of the number of characters and the last letter of each name, combined with the contextual clues that are provided in the poems, renders virtually all the individuals in the Hell Cantos identifiable as individuals. Over the years, however, Pound consistently and resolutely discouraged their identification (he told the correspondent above, for example, "Person looking for gibberish welcome to find it"). Although he was willing to supply names for the pseudonyms used to refer to those condemned to Purgatory in Canto 16, he uncharacteristically refused ever to disclose the names of the damned. Guy Davenport noted that when "asked in 1959 to supply the[se] suppressed names," Pound offered his standard reply that "the names are so infamous that they ought not to be preserved," then added, suggestively, "the young ought to try to verify [their] guesses as to the INDIVIDUALS most deserving the loathing of all clean men."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>


<p>
Pound was well aware that even if he was not accused of libel by any of the res he indicts in the Hell Cantos, his judgments would nevertheless be deemed "obscene" under Section 211 of the U.S. Penal Code, which meant that the poems could neither be copyrighted in America nor travel through the U.S. mail. He had for years (no fewer than seven) been acutely aware of how issues of censorship and libel affected what could be published and where, and his decision to replace every character but the final one or two in each name with an ellipsis may have been motivated in part by the possibility of repercussions from civil suits. Yet this instrumental account&#8212;that Pound feared legal retribution&#8212;is the only one critics have supplied, and while it plausibly explains the anonymity of the poems, it fails to attend to the concomitant development of a form of recoverable identity.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 This divergence in Pound's mode of attribution, entirely new to the Hell Cantos, needs a fuller explanation.

<p>

The Enemy : T. S. Eliot
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The best-known criticism of the Hell Cantos, delivered by T. S. Eliot in his Page-Barbour lectures at the University of Virginia and published the next year as <i>After Strange Gods: A Primer on Modern Heresy</i> , neglects political and legal issues and attempts to circumvent the identification of the damned altogether.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 He offered instead a taxonomy of the genus <i>damned</i>, and he did so even as Faber (Eliot's own publishing house) was preparing to release an inexpensive trade edition of <i>A Draft of XXX Cantos</i>  that would contain the first widely- circulated, transatlantic printing of the Hell Cantos (<i>PE,</i> 414). Eliot declared publicly that "Mr. Pound's Hell, for all its horrors . . . is a Hell for the <i>other people,</i> the people we read about in the newspapers, not for oneself and one's friends"; he suggested privately that Pound could rectify
<b></b>
the problem by putting him in it.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 These critical comments point to the cantos' most compelling irony, as he must surely have known: not only do the poems represent Mr. Pound's all-too-personal Hell, but it had been defined, in large part, by the monumental success of his friend, his rival, his enemy, Mr. Eliot.

<p>
Eliot's "one considerable objection" to the Hell Cantos in <i>After Strange Gods</i> addresses a perceived lack of specificity, signaling an inability or unwillingness to see both individuals and types in a single image. He said, "the variety of types&#8212;for these are types and not individuals&#8212;may be a little confusing." This Hell "consists," he posited, pausing to note parenthetically "(I may have overlooked one or two species)"

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
of politicians, profiteers, financiers, newspaper proprietors and their hired men, <i>agents provocateurs,</i> Calvin, St. Clement of Alexandria, the English, vice-crusaders, liars, the stupid, pedants, preachers, those who do not believe in Social Credit, bishops, lady golfers, Fabians, conservatives and imperialists; and all "those who have set money-lust before the pleasures of the senses." [<i>ASG,</i> 42-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot, as usual, did not overlook much. With the exception of its circle of "lady golfers," Pound populated his Hell exclusively with upper- and middle-class white men. Only one of these, the American journalist Walter Lippmann, a former member of the editorial board of the <i>Dial,</i> currently affiliated with the <i>New Republic,</i> is Jewish.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 In the poem, Lippmann is described without special prejudice as "a multiple . . . . . . nn" who "breeds by scission" (15/65). The only species Eliot had "overlooked" was that of prestigious Anglo-Catholic litterateurs, which consists of the two res most likely to read the poems and recognize themselves in them: Chesterton and himself.

<p>
At some point between the idea and the reality of <i>The Waste Land,</i> Eliot had come to embody Pound's concept of the enemy as expressed in the Hell Cantos. In "Betrayal by Clergy" Pound gives the distinct but misleading impression that he had derived this model of enmity from Julien Benda's <i>La Trahison des Clercs</i> .
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
In terms of the twinned polemical impulses of predication and attribution, however, Carl Schmitt's <i>Concept of the Political</i>  comes much closer to the tenor of thought Pound had otherwise ascribed to Benda. While it is difficult to gauge Pound's familiarity with the work of the rising legal theorist of the Third Reich, it is less so to understand how Schmitt's "transformation of the foe concept in favor of the public enemy notion" underwrites Pound's polemical project as well.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
 Recall, for example, that until the mid- to late-1930s Pound consistently referred to his polemical poems as expressing an "<i>impersonal</i> indignation." Schmitt also declared that while "feelings of personal hatred" have no place in the friend-enemy distinction that defines the political, "[e]very religious, moral, economic, ethical, or other antithesis transforms into a political one if it is sufficiently strong. . . ."
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 An adaptation of this concept helps to explain how Eliot could remain Pound's collaborator and friend in one sense, and become a rival and enemy in another.

<p>
As a by-product of editing and promoting Eliot's innovative masterpiece, Pound felt he ran the risk of invalidating his own.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 Upon the completion of a fully-edited 
<b></b>
manuscript draft of <i>The Waste Land</i> he wrote, "Complimenti, you bitch. I am wracked by the seven jealousies" (<i>L,</i> 169). Read literally&#8212;as they should be&#8212;these are telling lines. They also resonate with the emphasis that Friedrich Nietzsche (an important precursor for Schmitt, and arguably for Pound as well) ascribes to the importance of equality before the enemy. He asserts, "I only attack . . . when every personal quarrel is excluded, when any background of bad experiences is lacking. On the contrary, attack is in my case a proof of good will, sometimes even of gratitude."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 In this context, the friend-enemy distinction can elucidate not only Pound's rationale for declaring Chesterton a public enemy in the field of cultural production in 1914 but also for his replacement of Chesterton with the more powerful, more similar, and thus more dangerous Eliot in 1922. That is to say, Chesterton, Pound's opposite, is demoted in the Hell Cantos from the lowest artistic position to the highest journalistic one. He remains a public enemy, but of an entirely different kind. Conversely, Eliot, the serious artist's "monstrous" double, is promoted to the position of the true enemy.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>


<p>
Eliot's presence arises in Canto 14 soon after Chesterton's fades. He is initially only intimated in a parody of the lines from <i>The Waste Land,</i> close to the end of "The Burial of the Dead," that describe postwar London as an

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Unreal city

<br />
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,

<br />
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,

<br />
I had not thought death had undone so many.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Pound's editorial work on this groundbreaking poem has been well documented, as have his efforts to secure sufficiently attractive terms to ensure its American publication in the <i>Dial.</i>
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 It is in the light of those efforts that one should read his lines:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />

<br />

<br />
the invisible, many English,

<br />
the place lacking in interest,

<br />
last squalor, utter decrepitude. . . .

<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[14/62]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
For in that light they parody Eliot's flower of high modernism almost as plainly as the first line of the next canto Pound wrote parodies the well-known line near the end of the final section of <i>The Waste Land,</i> "These fragments I have shored against my ruins."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
 Indeed, prior to publishing the Malatesta sequence in his <i>Criterion,</i> Eliot told Pound that he "object[ed] strongly on tactical grounds" to the reference made by the line, "These fragments you have shelved (shored)."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 He explained that "[p]eople are inclined to think that we write our verses in collaboration as it is, or else that you write 
<b></b>
mine &amp; I write yours," and suggesting that, "With your permission[,] we will begin with line 2."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>


<p>
Nevertheless, Eliot did consider publishing the Hell Cantos in the inaugural issue of his own as-yet unnamed literary review, scheduled to come out in October 1922. "If the <i>Dial</i> refuses please let me inspect," Eliot wrote Pound in late July.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
 Had he accepted the Hell Cantos for the journal that became the <i>Criterion</i>&#8212;or had they been accepted by the editors of the <i>Dial</i>&#8212;they would likely have been printed, provocatively enough, alongside either the first American or British printing of <i>The Waste Land,</i> respectively.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
 Eliot goes on to explain that the poems' publication in his journal would, unwisely in his estimation, "make the paper too conspicuous at first, if the rape of the bishop is an integral part. I have decided not to put any manifestoe in the 1st number, but [to] adopt a protective colour for a time until suspicion is lulled. What do you think of 'The Possum' for a title?"
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Although the bishop, ". . . . . . Episcopus," is portrayed in Canto 15

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->

</blockquote>

<p>
and has a somewhat ominous "circle of lady golfers about him," nothing seems to have been done to him in the published version of either of the poems or in any of their extant manuscript versions. Furthermore, the final lines of Canto 14, in which ". . . . . m Episcopus" is found "waving a condom full of black beetles," also appear to depict an action (and a condom) that is his own (14/62). Yet Eliot's teasing comment about adopting a protective color and question about the title for the journal demonstrate his awareness that he was, in fact, that bishop. This letter establishes that the lines parodying <i>The Waste Land</i> in Canto 14 are not the ones that most directly invoke the "Possum" in Hell, for this is how Pound had recently begun to refer to Eliot for his ability to "appear dead while . . . still alive."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>


<p>
"Possum Episcopus"; Bishop Eliot: Pound's bestowal of the title "Episcopus" refers to Eliot's ever-intensifying commitment to the Anglican Church, a proclivity that had long troubled him and resulted finally, perhaps unsurprisingly, in the publication of the very "primer on modern heresy" in which he reproves&#8212;and dismisses&#8212;the Hell Cantos.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
 While Eliot would have had no trouble recognizing himself in this tautonym, the setting of "chewed cigar-butts, without dignity, without tragedy," made familiar by such Eliotic notables as Bleistein and Burbank, renders the identification easier to make for the rest of Pound's readers (14/63).
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
 The verbatim repetition of the phrase "condom full of black beetles" not only draws special attention to the significance of the image (at the time black beetles could be seen to connote both homosexuality and the clergy), but also renders Eliot the only re who features in <i>both</i> of the Hell Cantos.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
 A concomitant meaning behind this insistence on the bishop's condom and 
<b></b>
the black beetles that fill it involves the ratio between the growth of Eliot's literary reputation and of his reluctance to publish his controversial early poems that Pound loved (particularly the "The Triumph of Bullshit" and the Columbo and Bolo verses).
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
 Pound may well have aligned the prophylaxis of such reluctance with Section 211, which made it possible to conflate poetic "works . . . in law's eye with the inventions of the late Dr. Condom," as Pound never tired of observing.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
 Like the unjust and unclear law, Eliot's unwillingness to disseminate his own polemical poems deprived postwar poetry of the more literally conceived "black beetles" necessary for the maintenance of arable literary and intellectual "soil," which Pound currently saw as "a decrepitude, the ooze full of morsels, / lost contours, erosions" (14/62).
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
 And while those "morsels" are fairly far removed from any fragments shored against cultural ruin, Pound's use of "ooze" here resonates with the parenthetical observation in his congratulatory letter to Eliot that <i>The Waste Land,</i> "to your horror probably, reads aloud very well. Mouthing out his OOOOOOze" (<i>L,</i> 169).

The Process of Elision and the Multistable Image
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
A proper theoretical account of polemical predication and attribution must take seriously Pound's claim about the voluntary elision of proper names. As with any conventional consensus, we owe skepticism to the idea that Pound censored himself merely for fear of legal reprisal. After all, Eliot gave assurance that he would permit an overt reference to himself in the Hell Cantos, but if Pound had acted on that assurance it would certainly have changed the force of the reference. In this sense, a final model by which we can analyze the process of reading these poems with&#8212;or without&#8212;a knowledge of the proper names of the damned is recommended by Michel Foucault's consideration, in the first chapter of <i>The Order of Things</i> , of the anonymous res represented in Diego Vel&aacute;zquez's <i>Las Meninas.</i> "Perhaps it would be better, once and for all," he suggests, "to determine the identities of all the res presented or indicated here, so as to avoid embroiling ourselves forever in those vague, rather abstract designations, so constantly prone to misunderstanding."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
 He acknowledges&#8212;as Pound had consistently done since his <i>BLAST</i> period&#8212;that proper names, generally speaking, "form useful landmarks and avoid ambiguous designations" (<i>OT,</i> 9). But he concludes, after careful consideration, that "if one wishes to keep the relation of language to vision open . . . then one must erase those proper names and preserve the infinity of the task" (<i>OT,</i> 10). Like Pound, Foucault ultimately opts for a strategic anonymity. The reasons why are illuminating.

<p>
As we have seen, the form of recoverable identity that structures Pound's multistable images of the damned, once their proper names have been registered as palimpsestic blanks, allows each public enemy to exist as both an individual and a type. The simultaneous perception of the two categories in a single image actualizes the polemical multistable image that Pound had begun developing in "The New Cake of Soap." Here, however, there is no need for a trope such as "like the cheek." The proper name itself, through its "natural" process of corruption, has itself been denatured to serve as 
<b></b>
a trope. In this way, it can perfectly merge the objective and the subjective in a single stroke even as it maintains sufficient distinctiveness for separate identification. This model of representation shows attribution to be a component of objective predication rather than its necessary (but never sufficient) condition, as it had been in Pound's nascent conception of avant-garde satire.

<p>
As Pound knew well from his <i>BLAST</i> days, the shock of charged language is transient and the effect of satiric wit fades all too quickly. Famously and rightly, Herbert Marcuse attributed these conditions of reception to what he termed culture's affirmative character. On his model, although individual texts may (and often do) criticize society and its members in a wide range of different ways, the reader's anticipation of a deferred social harmony&#8212;a neat conclusion or happy ending&#8212;inevitably "risks . . . affirming precisely what is criticized by the contents of the work."
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
 Yet while it is true that "even the most critical work inevitably exhibits a dialectical unity of affirmation and negation," it is no less true that this impulse toward recuperation and synthesis is a result of the development of bourgeois reading practices and not of the forms of the art itself.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>


<p>
The circumvention of culture's affirmative character requires the polemicist to devise a means by which assaultive poems can suspend the affirmatory impulse to wrest meaning from their forms and, in this fashion, remain grounded in the reader's consciousness. Pound's intense, dynamic, living language seeks to alter reading practices by addressing readers in a fresh way. It seeks to prevent the otherwise inevitable "consumption" of the poems' violence through "the enigmatic [i.e., palimpsestic and multistable] quality of the forms, their resistance to the attempt to wrest meaning from them."
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
 Both at the time of composition and in years to follow, Pound prized this quality of aggressive and revelatory predication in his polemic. "A revelation is always didactic," he claimed upon the Hell Cantos' completion. "Only the aesthetes since 1880 have pretended the contrary, and they aren't a very steady lot" (<i>L,</i> 180). Moreover, his inclusion of Canto 14 in the selected cantos made this didactic revelation accessible to readers (particularly students and other young readers) who were, or are, unlikely to grapple with the long poem in its entirety. This demonstrates a pessimistic and accurate conviction in the aspect of historical recurrence in his first rigorously contemporary cantos, precisely as he had explained it to Davenport when he said that "the young ought to try to verify [their] guesses as to the INDIVIDUALS most deserving the loathing of all clean men." Those individuals, as types, have changed little over the past eighty years. The infernal signs are clearly posted: "here the placard EIKWN THS [image of the earth] / and here: THE PERSONNEL CHANGES" (14/62).

<p>
Over the course of several years' archival work I discovered the identities of all the formerly unidentified res in Canto 14 and most of those in Canto 15. During that time, however, I also discovered that Pound's uncharacteristic evasiveness about his palimpsestic blanks had been, in many ways, motivated by a legitimate poetic concern: the Hell Cantos are less about the names of the damned than about the images generated by the elision of those names. The proper names had to be recoverable for the polemically multistable images to be effective, and yet the process of recovering them 
<b></b>
very nearly persuaded me, finally, not to list them. It certainly convinced me that if one wishes to experience a didactic revelation, it may be best&#8212;even necessary&#8212;to wrest it for oneself. This is the only way to keep the relation of verbal to visual representation open, in Foucault's terms, and to obviate culture's otherwise affirmative character, in Marcuse's. In Pound's and Fenollosa's terms, it sustains the moment of transformation and allows for the simultaneous (and perhaps suprahistorical) perception of the objective and the subjective. Yet the missing identities have an independent historical significance as well, one that ultimately justifies their specification despite any poetic or theoretical arguments to the contrary.

<p>
Proceeding sequentially through the two poems, I will conclude with an annotated digest of the denizens of Pound's Hell.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
 Canto 14 opens with the politicians Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson (the former British Prime Minister and American President are identified in Terrell's <i>Companion,</i> as is Winston Churchill in Canto 15). "With them" are Lord Balfour and Lord Lee of Fareham. Balfour has "a scrupulously clean table-napkin / Tucked under his penis." Pound takes this memorable image, which recurs in Canto 46, from an unprinted satirical sketch by Max Beerbohm that he found in the offices of Orage's <i>New Age.</i> Lee of Fareham, "Who disliked colloquial language," is posed "Stiff starched, but soiled, [with] collars / circumscribing his legs." The poet damned him for his conduct at and after the Washington Conference for the Limitation of Armament, which concluded on 9 February 1922, at which he was, after Balfour, the highest-ranking British delegate. The Greek arms merchant Sir Basil Zaharoff, also known as Zenos Mevetsky in Cantos 18 and 38, is Pound's representative war profiteer, whom "the financiers [are] lashing . . . with steel wires." The <i>Companion</i> also suggests this identification, which is, in fact, correct. The chief "betrayer" of language and representative of "the press gang" is, as we have seen, Chesterton, who had been Pound's chosen model for the unserious artist and pandering journalist since 1913. Pope Benedict XV, the Sovereign Pontiff during World War I, is the religious re "frigging a tin penny whistle," and the bishop found among the "chewed cigar-butts," "waving a condom full of black beetles," is, of course, Eliot&#8212;here called Possum Episcopus.

<p>
The beginning of Canto 15 has proved more resistant. I have yet to recover the identities of the first and third res, although the third elided word (comprised of eight ellipses ending in "sis") may well be an additional title for the second re, who is Eliot as Possum Episcopus. And while the pair of "cowardly inciters to violence"&#8212;almost certainly politicians&#8212;who are "eaten by weevils" also remain to be discovered, Churchill has been identified in the next line by the <i>Companion.</i> Then we are confronted by the "the news owners," Cyrus H. K. Curtis and Lord Northcliffe. Curtis, here dubbed "the anonymous," was briefly a neighbor of the Pounds' on Fernbrook Avenue in Wyncote, Pa. and later owned both <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and <i>The Ladies' Home Journal,</i> the first two periodicals marketed to their respective audiences to attain a circulation of one million copies. Unlike Curtis, Northcliffe, the recently deceased magnate of British newspaper publishing, was anything but anonymous; he is described here as "broken" with "his head shot like a cannon-ball toward the glass gate." 
<b></b>
Finally, a depiction of "boredom born out of boredom" red as (and in) proliferating "copies of the <i>New Republic</i>"&#8212;an influential American journal despised by the poet&#8212;follows these two "newspaper proprietors." Alongside the <i>New Republic</i> is one of its regular contributors, and the only Jew in Pound's Hell, the public intellectual and political theorist Walter Lippmann.

<p>
Filling in the Hell Canto's palimpsestic blanks&#8212;especially when the elided names are those of minor or unexpected res&#8212;offers a new and revised sense of Pound's aesthetic, intellectual, social, and political concerns at a crucial moment of high modernism. Moreover, since the poems' veil of anonymity provided the freedom to condemn virtually any enemy with impunity, the recovery of the names of those enemies ultimately deemed worthy of damnation leaves no cause to suspect any disingenuousness in the process of their selection. For that reason, the recovered identities scrupulously reflect Pound's proclivities and prejudices in early 1922. And while I have focused primarily on aesthetic implications, the decision to indict no economists and only one Jew attests that this period predates Pound's most virulent feelings of anti-Semitism, his deepest convictions regarding economic determinism, and his systemic association of political corruption with usury.

His peculiar sense of his own mildness gains relevance only in relation to the vehemence to come: the preference for polemical "dynamite" he expressed regarding the Hell Cantos eventually led to his full-blown appreciation of "verbal nitroglycerin" while writing <i>Jefferson and/or Mussolini</i> (London: Stanley Nott, 1935) in February 1933.

Compare the poetic multistable image in "The New Cake of Soap" with Mitchell's analysis of the visually multistable Duck-Rabbit, which similarly accommodates two contrary readings, but only allows the reader access to one or the other at any given moment: "When I see the duck, my mind's eye interprets the Duck-Rabbit as a duck; when I see a rabbit, my mind's eye interprets it as a rabbit" (50, 51).

<i>L,</i> 274. Pound's juridical sensibility here recalls his contemporaneous agreement with Shelley's contention, "All values come from our [that is, poets'] judicial sentences" (<i>L,</i> 181). If the poet is to serve in any meaningful sense as a cultural judge, then his sentences, like those of a legal judge, must be both potent and final. This is the object of Pound's polemic. See Robert M. Cover, "Violence and the Word," in <i>Narrative, Violence, and the Law: The Essays of Robert Cover,</i> ed.

The page proofs of <i>A Draft of XVI. Cantos</i> corroborate Pound's testimony to Bird's editorial care: on them the correct number of ellipses has been written in pencil under each elided name. This attention to detail, however, diminished each time the poems were re-typeset. For example, although <i>A Draft of XXX Cantos</i> accurately retained nine ellipses for Chesterton, the ubiquitous New Directions edition has had, in each of its thirteen printings, only six.

Sherry observes, after Bush, that an "expanded sense of speaking decorum . . . is one of the practical lessons that Pound learned from Eliot's poem," adding that the "hubbub of talk" that fills Eliot's wasteland is not formally unlike the "pandemonium of voices" that fills Pound's Hell. <i>Radical Modernism,</i> 143, 150.

Whether or not Pound ever <i>formally</i> submitted the Hell Cantos to the <i>Dial,</i> they were almost certainly the "two lemons which he recommend[ed] very highly" to James Sibley Watson, Jr., co-owner of the journal (with Scofield Thayer), while acting as broker for <i>The Waste Land</i> on 29 July 1922. <i>Pound, Thayer, Watson, and</i> The Dial<i>: A Story in Letters,</i> ed.

<p>
Globalization is bound to change the field of cultural and literary studies, and it poses a serious challenge to modernist studies. More significantly, it also represents a major challenge to various traditional and current notions of culture itself. But so far, processes of globalization as distinct from historically comparable, earlier phenomena such as internationalization or empire building and colonization have been studied primarily in terms of economics (financial markets, trade, transnational corporations); information technology (television, computers, the internet); and politics (the waning of the nation state, civil society, the rise of NGOs). The cultural dimensions of globalization and its history remain poorly understood, often for the simple reason that "real" or "authentic" culture&#8212;especially if framed in an anthropological or post-Herderian context&#8212;is seen as that which is subjectively shared by a given community and therefore local. Only economic processes and technological change are perceived as universal and global. This global/local binary, however, is as homogenizing as the alleged cultural homogenization of the global it opposes.

<p>
How does the concern with  fit into this debate? Most modernist research in the U.S. academy is still largely bound by the local. It remains predominantly tied to the traditional North Atlantic canon and its disciplinary codification in national or regional departments of language, literature, and culture. The canon has indeed been expanded in recent 
<b></b>
years by the inclusion of phenomena such as the Harlem Renaissance or Caribbean modernism; but processes of translation and transnational migrations and their effects remain insufficiently studied outside of local specializations. We lack a workable model of comparative studies that goes beyond traditional approaches and that still takes national cultures as the units to be compared. Tim Mitchell has argued that modernity has always presented itself as a stage of history and as a stage for historiography in relation to the temporally and geographically non-modern.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Modernist research has long focused on the former, but neglected the latter: the modernity of the geographically "non-modern."

<p>
Clearly, globalization provides the horizon for the work of comparative modernisms today. But how can the transition be made from the often bland considerations of the global in much of the literature&#8212;where the global appears either as threatening specter or as beneficial invisible hand&#8212;to the study of cultural genealogies of language, medium, and image as they undergo transformations under the pressures of the global?

<p>
In this essay, I revert to a model of literary and cultural studies that, for rather parochial reasons, has been prematurely put to rest by U.S. postmodernism: the model of high and low art or elite and mass culture. High/low should here be seen as a cipher for a much more complex set of relations that always involve palimpsests of times and spaces that are anything but binary. I suggest that this model, once freed from earlier parochialisms stemming from its embeddedness in U.S./European constellations, may well serve as a template through which to look comparatively at phenomena of cultural globalization&#8212;including that earlier phase of non-European modernisms in Asia, Latin America, or Africa. For too long, such non-Western modernisms have either been ignored as epistemologically impossible&#8212;since only the West was considered advanced enough to generate authentic modernism&#8212;or dismissed as lamentable mimicry and contamination of a more genuine local culture. Such "studied ignorance," as Gayatri Spivak once called it, is no longer acceptable.

<p>
However, the high/low problematic also extends to the realm of tradition and its activation in the present, taking very different forms at different historical times and often inflected by radically different politics. This becomes clear when you consider, for example, the political role played today by classical Brahmin epics in India, epics written in Sanskrit ages ago but endlessly displayed on television and circulated in many languages in oral culture today; the renewed struggle in China over what in Mao's times was relegated to the margin as feudal culture; and, also in China, the turn to traditional popular culture as a defense against the influx of Western mass culture&#8212;a debate heavily invested with politics; or for that matter the complex mix of Spanish and Portuguese baroque culture within indigenous Indian, African, and other European immigrant traditions in certain countries of Latin America. The permeability of the borders between high and low beginning in the period following high modernism cannot be limited to the West (although this is one of the favorite tropes in the Northern debates that some twenty years ago made us read the Latin American boom novel as a kind of postmodernism avant la lettre).
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Indeed, a strong and stable literary high 
<b></b>
culture cannot be assumed to have existed everywhere on the model of European nation states such as France, England, or Germany. Such different pasts will inevitably shape the ways a specific culture will negotiate the impact of globalization and its attendant spread of media, communication technologies, and consumerism. In many parts of the world, the legacies of imported <i>and</i> indigenous modernisms are very much part of such negotiations. Even while media and consumerism may spread everywhere in the world&#8212;although with different intensities and widely divergent access&#8212;the imaginaries they produce are far from homogeneous.

<p>
As comparatists, however, we do have a problem. At a time when literary studies is asked to cover ever more territory both geographically and historically (thus overloading any individual critic's circuits), the discipline is in danger of losing its coherence as a field of investigation, of becoming bogged down in ever more local case studies, or of becoming superficial in its negligence to maintain a methodological and theoretical project. The U.S. model of cultural studies in particular can not adequately face the new challenges. Among its critical limitations are a reductive focus on thematics and cultural ethnographies; a privileging of consumption over production; a lack of historical depth; and an abandonment of aesthetic and formal issues coupled with its unquestioned privileging of popular and mass culture.

<p>
The recurrent call for a return to the facts or to traditional philology is certainly no solution. However, the increasing demand for a return to disciplinarity may be more promising, depending crucially on how "return" is defined. If it is meant to annul the changes in the humanities brought about by "theory" and the "cultural turn," it would simply be a regression. But if the return to disciplinarity was meant to counter the premature anti-disciplinarity of so much cultural studies by merging recent theory with traditional critical practices of the disciplines, it could play a salutary role. For if globalization requires one single thing from the cultural critic, it would be a model for comparative study across borders, languages, and cultures that might help nurture a new sense of connectedness in difference, perhaps even a new kind of cosmopolitanism. A major task, then, is to create a set of conceptual parameters for such comparisons that would lend coherence to a field of study in danger of becoming either too amorphous or remaining simply parochial. My tentative reflections in this essay, therefore, are meant to move us into that crucial cultural space between the local, the national, and the global. And here it may be important for humanists and literary scholars to draw on the recent attempts to revitalize social science area studies that are themselves searching for new transnational and transregional paradigms.

<p>
The demand for an alternative model of comparison that would transcend an older, European-style comparative literature paradigm may be new, but not all tools need to be invented from scratch.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Ultimately, the issue of globalization remains very much tied up with the rich debate about modernity and aesthetic modernism and their respective historical trajectories. For the political and cultural developments of the 1990s have not been kind to the postmodernists' confident prediction that modernity was at an end, let alone the even more triumphalist claim that history had ended.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Further, the equation of modernity and even modernism with fascism, totalitarianism, and genocide
<b></b>
has been similarly ineffectual. Modernity is now (and has been for some time) everywhere, and the discourse of postmodernity seems only an episode (if a significant one) within a certain transformation of Western modernity itself. The issue facing critics, therefore, is no longer modernity vs. postmodernity (although this inevitably reductive binary still underlies much of the currently popular anti-modernity thinking that issues from a narrowly understood postcolonial approach).
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The issue is rather what Arjun Appadurai has identified as modernity-at-large, and what others have described as alternative modernities. As Dilip Gaonkar wrote in a recent special issue of <i>Public Culture</i> on alternative modernities, modernity

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
has arrived not suddenly but slowly, bit by bit, over the <i>longue dur&eacute;e</i>&#8212;awakened by contact; transported through commerce; administered by empires, bearing colonial inscriptions; propelled by nationalism; and now increasingly steered by global media, migration, and capital.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
Indeed, the critical focus on alternative modernities with their rich histories and local contingencies now seems to offer a better way to understand the here, there, and now than either the notion of postmodernism in Asia and Latin America, or current globalization theories in the social sciences that uncannily resemble Cold War, U.S. generated modernization theory. Even if the West remains a major powerbroker and "clearinghouse" of world-wide modernities, as Dilip Gaonkar puts it, it does not offer the only model of cultural development (as both cyber-utopians and the dystopian McDonaldization theorists seem to believe). Nor does the West possess the only model of political development toward civil society and human rights. The standard tale of the two modernities in which aesthetic modernism and avant-gardism in Europe are cast as adversary cultures directed against bourgeois society now appears very place- and time-specific. We need only consider "Shanghai modern" in the 1920s as the space of emergence of Chinese communism, or the explosion of modernism in Brazil in the 1920s and 1930s and its instrumentalization for a national proto-fascist project to know that the oppositional European model between social and economic modernity and aesthetic modernism does not translate seamlessly into other contexts. Indeed, it no longer applies today as an interpretive model for European culture itself, and it was never an apt model for colonial or communist societies in which cultural and political modernization was shaped by very different constellations. Such historical and geopolitical differences are at stake with the notion of "modernity at large" that avoids the trap of homogenization claims as strongly as it rejects the illusion of a happy plurality of modernities&#8212;a kind of theoretical Benetton effect.

<p>
The same need to argue in place- and time-specific ways applies to the relationship between high art and mass culture that accompanied the trajectory of Western modernity from romanticism to postmodernism and that is intimately connected to the idea of modernism as adversary culture. Much valuable recent work on the editing, marketing, and dissemination of modernism has misconstrued my earlier definition of the Great Divide as a static binary of high modernism vs. the market. My argument was 
<b></b>
rather that there had been, since the mid-nineteenth century in Europe, a powerful imaginary insisting on the divide while time and again violating that categorical separation in practice.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 After all, the insight that all cultural products are subject to the market was already advanced by Theodor Adorno, key theorist of the divide, in the late 1930s.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Thus the recent, detailed documentation of the high modernists' involvement with the marketing of their works, their bickering with publishers, and engagement with small journal enterprises&#8212;even with fashion magazines&#8212;will not do away with the issue of the divide as a central conceptual trope and energizing norm of the post-World War II period that took hold in the context of Cold War cultural politics and the explosive acceleration of consumerism and television culture. It was that post-war version of the divide that was primarily at issue in the postmodernist debate of the 1970s and early 1980s, not what certain modernist authors and artists did or did not do at an earlier time. Finally, there was another dimension to the debate in the early 1980s. The critique of the divide in postmodernist discourse allowed the historical avant-garde to emerge retrospectively as an alternative to high modernism and legitimated a variety of neo-avant-garde enterprises of the 1960s and 1970s.

<p>
All of that is history. The modernism vs. mass culture problematic once central to the emergence of postmodernism and its project to break down the walls between high and low has since vanished from our screens. But it may have vanished for not entirely good reasons. To recall it now in more than just an archival way will require that the argument be freed from its limiting postmodernist connotations so that the high/low relation may be deployed in a geopolitically expanded frame.

<p>
I suggest that the model of high vs. low can be productively rethought and related to cultural developments in "peripheral," postcolonial, or post-communist societies. The high/low relationship has taken very different shapes and forms outside of the Northern Transatlantic which may enable comparative analyses of cultural globalization today as well as a new understanding of earlier and alternative roads taken within modernity. For example, it captures aspects of cultural hierarchies and social class, race, and religion; gender relations and codifications of sexuality; colonial cultural transfers; the relation between cultural tradition and modernity; the role of memory and the past in the contemporary world; and the relation of print media to visual mass media. In other words, the discourse about alternative modernities in India or in Latin America can be expanded profitably to include the assessment of alternative developments in the relations and crosscurrents between indigenous popular culture, minority cultures, high culture (both traditional and modern), and mass mediated culture. Historically alternative modernities have existed all along and their trajectories continue into the age of globalization.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>


<p>
Further, the reinscription of a complex and multi-layered high/low problematic into our discussions of cultural modernity in transnational contexts and across borders could counteract the widespread notion of cultural unity ascribed indiscriminately by such writers as Alan Bloom, Benjamin Barber, and Samuel Huntington to the culture of the East or the West, Islam or Christianity, the U.S. or Latin America. It could thus counter the bad heritage from cultural anthropology and a Spenglerian, American 
<b></b>
style Kulturkritik. The high/low dynamic might problematize the all too evident need to create an inside/outside myth maintaining a <i>Feindbild</i> (enemy image), an absolute other, that can be read itself as a heritage of the Cold War in current theories about clashing civilizations. Moreover, it could also oppose and complicate the equally limited argument that only local culture (or culture <i>as</i> local) is "good," authentic, and resistant, whereas global cultural forms should be condemned as manifestations of cultural imperialism&#8212;a frequent stand-in for Americanization. Every culture, after all, has its hierarchies and social stratifications, and these differ greatly according to local circumstances and histories. Unpacking such temporal and spatial differentiations might be a good way to arrive at new kinds of comparisons that will surpass the clich&eacute;s of colonial vs. postcolonial, modern vs. postmodern, Western vs. Eastern, center vs. periphery, global vs. local, the West vs. the rest. To de-Westernize notions such as modernity and modernism will require much more theoretically informed descriptive work about modernisms world-wide, including their interaction or non-interaction with Western modernisms; their relationship to different forms of colonialism (different in Latin America from South Asia and again from Africa); and their codings of the role of art and culture in relation to state and nationhood. It may well turn out that despite our best intentions, such de-Westernization of  will always remain limited or seem less pertinent than it does now.

<p>
However, for me, there is yet another significant reason to rethink the high/low relationship today. For it also points us back to the leftist modernism debates of the 1930s (those of Brecht, Luk&aacute;cs, Bloch, Benjamin, Adorno) and their never abandoned concern with issues of aesthetic value and aesthetic perception in relation to politics, history, and experience.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Revisiting the high/low problematic in a transnational context might then enable us to reinscribe the issue of aesthetic value and form into the contemporary debate, prompting us to rethink the historically altered relationship between the aesthetic and the political for our age in ways surpassing both the debates of the 1930s and the postmodernist and postcolonial debates of the 1980s and 1990s.

<p>
Indeed, in view of the fact that an aesthetic dimension shapes not just the high arts but also the products of consumer culture via design, advertising, and the mobilization of affect and desire, it is simply retrograde to claim that any concern with aesthetic form is inherently elitist. Moreover, those earlier debates were primarily organized around a linear temporal axis (modernism vs. realism, postmodernism vs. modernism) and focused on media of high culture such as literature and painting. The condition of globality, however, requires considering the strong geographic and spatial dimension as well as recognizing its different intertwinings and aesthetic effects. We might want to explore further what Arjun Appadurai has usefully described as the "production of locality" and locality-as-producing as a key ingredient of modernities-at-large.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Central to such a discussion might be the analysis of city cultures and the aesthetic perceptions and social uses of space they produce. Indeed spatial metaphoricity of the high/low distinction itself might be linked quite pragmatically to the different urban spaces of cultural production and consumption such as the street, the neighborhood, the museum, the concert hall and the opera house, the tourist site and the shopping mall. 
<b></b>
Reconsidering the high/low dynamic would reintroduce the issue of aesthetics and form that cultural studies in the U.S. (as opposed to cultural studies in Brazil or Argentina) has all but abandoned in its move against the alleged elitism of aesthetics. The politically legitimate attack on an earlier social-cultural elitism embodied in the re of the aesthetic connoisseur does not take into account the fact that today aesthetic "value" and the complexities of representation in cultural production can easily be uncoupled from the socially coded elitism associated with Bourdieu's "distinction." An apprehension of the aesthetic dimension of all image, music, and language production remains crucial to a better understanding of how cultural markets function under conditions of globalization.

Cultural studies in its current conration does not provide a good model for understanding globalizing cultures. From the vantage point of a U.S.-style cultural studies, it is easy to claim that the high-low debate has outlived its purpose. Following the events of 1989-90, postmodernism as a concept, like the concern over high and low culture, was swallowed up by an emerging new set of social, political, and economic conrations. The vast expansion of cultural markets, a new museum and gallery culture, and the electronic media have made evident the extent to which the postmodern high/low debate was still predicated on the stability of literacy and print as dominant medium, on the notion of architecture as building style, on the visual arts as high marker of culture, and on the nation state as guarantor of high culture in Western&#8212;especially North Atlantic&#8212;societies.

<p>
To revive <i>this</i> debate today would be futile. In the U.S. context&#8212;market triumphalism, lifestyle revolution, the victorious march of pop cultural studies through the institutions&#8212;low has won the battle and high has been relegated to the margins, the American culture wars notwithstanding. However, it has been a Pyrrhic victory, marred by continuing ressentiment toward the vanquished realm of high culture. A significant part of the left academia still decries high culture as elitist and Eurocentric, denounces aesthetics as totalitarian, and refuses a debate about cultural value. By contrast, the right ossifies traditional culture before modernism while rejecting contemporary high culture in much of the arts as well as in the literary and theoretical fields. The outcome has thus not been the creative merger of high and low, as it once was imagined by some in the postmodernist debate of the 1970s and early 1980s&#8212;a new democratic culture that would couple aesthetic complexity with mass appeal, abolish hierarchies of taste and class, and usher us into a new age of cultural pleasure beyond either the entropies and minimalisms of late modernism or the numbing hegemony of Cold War mass culture. If there ever was a postmodern utopianism, this would have been it. But, as always with utopias, we have had to settle for much less.

<p>
Today, as we all know, the binary in its emphatic sense has been abolished by a new logic of cultural circulation brought about by media technologies, new patterns of marketing and consumption, and their radical effects both on cultural tradition and on 
<b></b>
the structures of fashion and entertainment. Adorno had intimated these developments in the late 1930s. There are also, however, social changes that no longer give even minimal support to a politically and socially relevant notion of high culture. The high turnover velocity of low culture has by now engulfed even the production of traditionally low-velocity high culture. Once solid cultural traditions (high) are set into motion by the rapid turn-over of museum blockbusters, museal asset management &agrave; la Guggenheim with its spectacular building projects; theater spectacles that become media shows; ancient epics that are turned into TV series and comic books; and festivals of classical music based on the star system, in which the global mobility of international actors, directors, orchestras, and art works matches that of global capital flows.

<p>
None of this is to claim that the distinction between high art and mass culture no longer exists, either in Western societies or elsewhere, as some might argue, for it very much does. Differences will always remain in quality, ambition, and complexity between cultural products, in demands on the attentiveness and knowledge of the consumer, and in diversely stratified audiences. But what used to be a vertical divide has become in the last few decades a horizontal borderland of exchanges and pillagings, of transnational travels back and forth, and all kinds of hybrid interventions. Complexity does not reside only on one side of the old binary.

<p>
Another aspect sets us apart from, for example, the situation in the 1980s. The largely national bases of both high and low cultures are fraying as a result of the cultural flows accompanying waves of migration and diasporas <i>and</i> as a result of the increasing number of corporate mergers in the culture industries across national borders. For those reasons alone, the high/low divide can no longer provide the field of battle for an alternative social or political imagination as it did in the twentieth century, first in the interwar years in Europe, and then again in the 1960s in Europe and the U.S. To see low as a threat to social and cultural cohesion is a conservative phantasm deployed for political maneuvering in the never-ending t of U.S. conservatives against the effects of the 1960s on secular culture and changing lifestyles. But this phantasm, of course, feeds the mirror phantasm of the rebel consumer and a left American populism.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>


<p>
How to get out of this dead-end? In a very preliminary way, I would suggest the following:

<p>
1. We abandon the high/low distinction in its traditional ration that opposes serious literature and art to the mass media, and replace this hierarchical or vertical value relation by a lateral or horizontal conration. This would de-dramatize the notion of high and acknowledge that high is as much subject to market pressures as low (and perhaps because of that in need of some support and protection). We no longer face a hegemonic culture industry and its autonomous high other (as suggested in the writings of Adorno or Clement Greenberg), but a quantitatively and qualitatively differentiated mass <i>and</i> niche marketing for all kinds of cultural consumption.

<p>
2. We should raise the issue of medium (oral/aural, written, visual) in all its historical, technical, and theoretical complexity rather than continue to rely on the traditional binary notion of media culture as low and its high literary other in traditional 
<b></b>
modernist fashion. For example, in a country such as Brazil where culture is shaped more by musical and visual traditions of the popular realm than by what Angel Rama has called the lettered city, such a focus on mediality would be more pertinent than the high/low distinction itself.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>


<p>
3. We should reintroduce issues of aesthetic quality and form into our analysis of any and all cultural practices and products. Here the question of criteria is obviously key: rather than privilege the radically new in avant-garde fashion, we may want to focus on the complexity of repetition, rewriting, and bricolage. The emphasis might then be on suggestive intertextuality, creative mimicry, the power of a text to question ingrained habits through visual or narrative strategies, the ability to transform media usage, and so forth. This suggestion argues for a modernism in the Brechtian sense, but it is a modernism with a difference.

<p>
4. We should abandon the notion that a successful attack on elite culture can play a major role in a political and social transformation. This was the signature of the avant-garde and still lingers in certain academic-populist outposts. Instead we should pay close attention to the ways in which cultural practices and products are linked to the discourses of the political and the social in specific local and national constellations. Here, for example, the issue of how major exhibits, museums, and cultural mega-events are funded and whether or not funding determines content yields a more fruitful field for investigation than the focus on the purity of high vs. the contamination of low. At the same time, we need to acknowledge that culture is no longer organized according to habitus and distinction as described by Pierre Bourdieu. When everything becomes available (although not always accessible) to the consumer's choice, it becomes that much harder to find a place for effective political critique.

<p>
5. In all of this, comparatists can draw on a combination of a non-reductive cultural studies with the disciplines of cultural history (including a sociological and economic dimension), the new anthropology, and the traditions of literary and artistic criticism. Key will be a sustained focus on the operations and functioning of public cultures and the changing role of critique within them. Here, it seems to me, we need to draw on the debates about civil society, imagined communities, gender, subalternity, and the emerging debate about transnational urban imaginaries.

<p>
If we succeed in making our reading skills available to those other projects, we will have expanded the field of literary criticism without abandoning what we do best.

Thinking back to the high/low problematic today points to the distance we have traveled since the heady days of postmodernism and the emergence of new forms of cultural studies. But it also reveals the underlying American parochialism of the postmodernism craze. Postmodernism thought itself global, but was perhaps nothing more than the belated attempt to create a U.S. International against the model of the European International Style of high modernism belonging to the interwar period (1918-39). And yet, the postmodern decades in the U.S. from the 1960s to the 1980s 
<b></b>
generated a new relationship between high culture and mass media culture that resonates, however differently, in other cultures of the world. However, the simple reversal of the old high/low hierarchy advanced by U.S. cultural studies is not the solution. It may even be perceived as a betrayal of the original promises of the postmodern itself.

<p>
In a global context, therefore, the question about the relationship between high culture (both traditional and modern), indigenous and national popular culture, minority or subaltern cultures, and transnational mass media culture may still provide an impetus for a new kind of comparative work. This new comparative study would draw our attention to the very different forms such constellations take, for example, in India or China as compared with different countries in Latin America or Eastern Europe. A number of interesting theoretical questions emerge in this context. We may ask whether and how postcolonial theory applies unproblematically to Latin American countries whose colonial and postcolonial history is fundamentally different from that of India or African countries.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 We may also ask whether or not the notion of the subaltern can be transferred unproblematically from one geographic context to another, and whether notions of hybridity and diaspora&#8212;the latest master-signifiers&#8212;are sufficiently rigorous to describe the complex racial, ethnic, and linguistic mixings in different parts of the world.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 Attuned to the vicissitudes of traveling theory, we must guard against the facile translation of critical vocabularies from one intellectual and geopolitical context into another.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 And we must always secure deeper historical knowledge in order not to capitulate to the market and to the obliviousness of the present.

<p>
Clearly, the role of high culture today varies greatly from country to country, and in each case it is deeply embedded in local and national traditions, the different roles of state and private sectors in cultural politics, systems of national education, the strength or weakness of cultural institutions, and so forth. Yet some sectors of high culture, such as opera, classical European music, or contemporary art and Western architecture, have become transnational in organization and dissemination, as opposed to the theater or literature, which remain bound by language and thus more limited in reaching broad transnational audiences. Simultaneously, high culture itself has become ever more commercialized and spectacularized, much more so than even an Adorno could have imagined in the mid-twentieth century. The problem remains that some, both on the left and the right, still want to force us to choose between high and low, or, as Susan Sontag put it in the 1960s, between Dostoevski and The Doors. This choice, then and now, is to be rejected. Of course, postmodern practices in literature and the arts have rejected it all along, producing all kinds of fascinating hybridizations of high and low that seemed to open up new horizons for aesthetic experimentation. But today the celebration of a postmodern hybridity of high and low may itself have lost its once critical edge. Cultural production today not only crosses the borders between high and low, but has also become transnational in major new ways, especially in the music industry, but also in certain sectors of film and television (e.g., Indian cinema in Africa, the export of Brazilian telenovelas).
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Hybridization of whatever kind now happens increasingly under the sign of the market. But markets, even elite niche markets, as Nestor Canclini has pointed out in his recent book <i>La globalizaci&oacute;n imaginada,</i> 
<b></b>
tend to domesticate and equalize the rough and innovative edges of cultural production.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 They will go for the successful formula rather than encouraging the not-yet-known, experimentation, and unusual modes of aesthetic expression. The danger is that by now most of high culture is as much subject to market forces as mass mediated products. Big mergers in the publishing industry shrink the breathing space for ambitious writing. Literature itself, as we once knew it, becomes ever more an untimely enterprise. But this may also be literature's opportunity. For we need a space of writing to explore issues of aesthetic complexity, formal experimentation, the vicissitudes of representation, and radical political content. We need to ask whether or not the market can secure new traditions, new forms of transnational communications and connectivities. Finally, however, we would abandon our role as critical intellectuals if we were to exclude prematurely from such considerations the question of the complex imbrication of aesthetic value and political effect, a question fundamentally posed by the traditions of high culture that needs to be rescued for contemporary analyses of all culture under the spell of globalization.

See especially the introduction to Huyssen, <i>After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism</i> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986). I should add that the term the Great Divide not only referred to the imaginary divide between mass culture and modernism, but also to that other divide so central to the debates at the time, namely that between modernism and postmodernism. A main argument of the book was that both divides were generated by very specific political and aesthetic constellations and were always belied by the complexities of real relations in artistic practices.

The term "alternative modernity" may appear problematic to some. So let me say that it is not meant to suggest that there is one real and authentic modernity which, in its spreading across the world, created those alternative modernities in Latin America or in Asia. At the same time, our attempts to de-Westernize or to de-Europeanize the concept of modernity may ultimately run up against a real limit set by the genealogy of the concept itself. This tension is to be acknowledged rather than defused.

<p>
By now, there is a vast literature on "alternative modernities." Apart from the still challenging earlier work by Arjun Appadurai in <i>Modernity at Large</i> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1996), see for instance the special issue on multiple modernities, <i>Daedalus</i> 129, no. 1 , especially the essays by Stanley J.

Race and Masculinity

<p>
In 1913, young Wallace Stevens confessed to his wife Elsie, "[M]y habits are positively lady-like." This epistolary admission launches Frank Lentricchia's <i>Ariel and the Police,</i> a study of continuing importance to gender readings of the poet.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Lentricchia cites the remark to indicate Stevens's discomfort with Gilded Age precepts, inculcated by his father's admonitions, about masculinity and the "effeminacy" of writing verse. By rooting the poet's career in a classic family drama framed by a period's gender ideologies, the critic re-masculinizes his subject and ascribes him to the role of anti-patriarchal poet, "the potential subverter of his official role as a young American male."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 Yet because Lentricchia relegates Stevens's gender struggle to its documentation in private letters and expression in confessional lyric, the poet's "subversion" is limited to a fixed set of psychological strategies that restructure his <i>individual</i> relationship to gender identities as they are formed in familial oedipal dramas.

<p>
<i>Ariel and the Police</i> secures Stevens's place as an archetypal modernist, a solitary poet who re-creates history and society in his own image and on the page, even if his yawp is lacking some of the requisite barbarism. Any depiction of his gender trouble as private psychologism, however, risks minimizing the public function that Stevens himself ascribes to poetry. Although nested away in private notebooks, the <i>Adagia</i> (1934-c.1940) constitute his earliest attempts to formulate an explicit statement of this function, later finding their way into many of his public speeches and programmatic poems. In his notebooks, Stevens distances 
<b></b>
his work from lyric's supposed confessionalism when he states that "Poetry is not personal." (This insight is later repeated with a slight variation, "Poetry is not a personal matter").
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Its publicity stems from its propositional qualities, its embodiment of "the statement of a relation between a man and the world" (<i>OP,</i> 197). Another adage adds, "The real is only the base. But it is the base" of the poem's relational statement (<i>OP,</i> 187). Through an important simile, Stevens compares the relation between the poet and the actual world to heterosexual eroticism: "A poet looks at the world somewhat as a man looks at a woman" (<i>OP,</i> 192). A gender reading of Stevens can begin by combining these choice <i>Adagia</i> into one proposition: Poetry is a public discourse derived from the poet's imaginative reconstruction of and erotic engagement with a "real," or social, "base." Because they are imaginative, poems never exist apart from elements of privacy and psychology; yet Stevens intuits that poetry's social effectiveness depends upon its ability to create correlations between private interests and the desires of large communities.

<p>
Stevens's minor qualification that poets only engage the world in a "somewhat" erotic manner lays bare how poetry's progressive public function is capable of reproducing some social asymmetries. Although he argues throughout his career that the imagination introduces change, Stevens's simile precludes any reimagining of gender binaries or epistemological structures that privilege masculine subjects as the entitled beneficiaries of a heteroerotic gaze. Consequently, I would advise a cautious approach to reading Stevens's redefinition of gender. Rather than reading him as an anti-patriarchal or subversive poet, it would be more accurate to characterize his work as arguing only for a <i>selective</i> revision of gender roles. That selection hinges on an identification of private desire&#8212;his private oedipal struggles against the Father and his resultant anxieties about the "effeminacy" of writing&#8212;with a larger community's interests. And time and again, Stevens defines that community along racial lines; in the early part of his career, his virile poet speaks only to white North America, to which he appeals to revise its precepts of masculine identity.

<p>
He does not mention race and gender together in any one essay, but the literary and social significances he separately ascribes to each suggest that they may be interrelated in his poetry. For example, in response to the 1938 questionnaire from <i>Twentieth Century Verse,</i> Stevens claims that "[t]he relationship between Americans is at least approximately racial, and does not pretend to be anything else . . . In short, there exists a clear sense of what is American" (<i>OP,</i> 308). Five years later in his essay "The re of the Youth as Virile Poet" , he would conclude that poetry's historical force was determined by its masculine qualities. "The centuries have a way of being male. Without pretending to say whether they get this character from their good heroes or their bad ones, it is certain that they get it, in part, from their philosophers and poets."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Stevens's ideal virile poet is conscious of "his obligation" to "the larger society"; he "must be the master of our lives" and is responsible for re-visioning society ("FY," 66). Race and gender are complementary terms that mediate poetry's imaginative negotiations of social narratives. Stevens's own desire and individual worldview could be thought to link the two as analogous functions, but even that mediating desire
<b></b>
is as discursively structured as his poetry's topical "base" of social referents.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 In the "Virile Poet" essay and in the <i>Adagia</i>, Stevens never contends that poetry challenges existent ideologies (as in Lentricchia's reading); instead, a "virile" poetic ensures that "invisible" and perhaps unconscious currents of thought become "visible," concrete, and stabilized social realities.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Given his and the period's cultural logics, his proof of white poetic masculinity's potency depends on poetry's ability to manage racial differences so as to intercede in debates about national identity.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>


<p>
A heightened consciousness of African American presences pervades Stevens's writings, and he often misconstrues racial subjects as unsettling the desired fixity of the poet's stance in relation to the world. When he introduces race, the poet's position is no longer just "somewhat" erotic; his narrators' perspectives become <i>overdetermined</i> by what his contemporaries would interpret as perverse forms of sexual desire, ranging from miscegenation to voyeurism to homosexuality. I do not read this perversion as a simplistic return of the racialized repressed, or as evidence that Stevens unsuccessfully suppresses African American culture or his desire to possess it, in either an appropriative or a sexual sense. In fact, he usually openly and directly addresses race. If it is inaccurate to read the erotic disruption that coincides with racial res as a symptom of a conflation of sexual and racial anxieties, it is best to read it as an indicator of social hierarchies, a glitch in Stevens's poetic that reveals his ideal of progressive poetic potency and actually necessitates a preservation of some social asymmetries. Discomforted, Stevens's narrators attempt to turn readers' attention away from African American res in order to dampen the visibility of their desire, not for racialized sexual objects, but for a controlling virility that reproduces some of the masculine qualities that Stevens hopes to change. Eroticism is the "tell" that reveals that the poet is <i>managing</i> social factors, even though he cannot let on that he is doing so for fear of making art collusive with a Fordist business ethos and of revealing that the supposedly democratic poet cannot simultaneously be egalitarian and virile.

<p>
An early depiction of the management of race occurs in "The Silver Plough-Boy"  (<i>OP,</i> 17). Only the title makes it clear that the poem presents a tableau of labor. The first line inscribes the eponymous worker in a racialized picaresque episode; he is a "black re" who "dances in a black field." As a "re" (rather than the titular "boy"), the worker is reified, an effect pronominally concretized in the lines that follow: "<i>It</i> seizes a sheet," "<i>It</i> wraps the sheet around <i>its</i> body," and "<i>It</i> dances down a furrow" (emphasis added). Rachel Blau DuPlessis reads the plough-boy as an "impish" muse who enables Stevens to recast "certain political tragedies [i.e., lynching and the KKK] policing African American life into blurry mythoi outside of time or space" because the sheet erases the black male body.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 I would venture one step further and suggest that the pronoun "it" neuters the plough-boy and preemptively defuses any eroticism. If the sheet should fall, his black body would no longer blend into the background of the "black field" since the impending arrival of the dawn's "early light" will illuminate him. By beginning three consecutive lines with the word "it," Stevens's narrator trains his reader to see this laborer as a dehumanized and de-eroticized object artfully rendered.



<b></b>

<p>

Yet, ambivalences surface. Although the sheet prophylactically hides the laborer's body, it also paradoxically imports an erotic valence. Only its silver color distinguishes the body from the pre-matinal background. In a sense, the covering makes the reader more aware of the laboring body, even if that body's maleness and race are erased by the impromptu costume's formlessness. The very banality of the object also generates sexual associations. The location from where the plough-boy "seizes" this ordinary sheet, "spread" outside by "some washer-woman," is of no small significance. "It seizes a sheet, from the ground, from the bush[.]" The second prepositional phrase ever so slightly adjusts and raises the first index, so that the sheet is taken from some location not on ground level. The word "bush" connotes an inviting female sexuality, especially when combined with the verb "spread." These associations multiply rather than contain the poem's perverse possibilities. Is this black boy in a sort of drag, wrapped in bedsheets once spread over a female anatomy? Or is the sheet a fetish? What is the race of the person to whom these sheets belong? There is a class difference between the black plough-boy and the sheet's presumed owner, since it is spread by another worker, "some washer-woman"; these differences might invite the reader to imagine an interracial sexual encounter. And should the sheet fall before a male reader's gaze (or the male poet's or a male narrator's), then he, conditioned by the poem's erotic elements, will see the boy's revealed body as a homoerotic object. A banal sheet expands multiform "perversions"&#8212;homoeroticism, transvestism, fetishism, miscegenation&#8212;that the narrator can neither anticipate nor eliminate.

<p>
The image of the plough-boy's linen-wound body eerily echoes W. E. B. DuBois's description of the color line as a Veil of double consciousness in <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i> . Contrary to DuBois's expectations, though, Stevens's poem indicates that it is possible for the Veil hiding the black subject to fall away in the white imagination. The narrator's prophylactic descriptions indicate a desire to restore the Veil, to direct the reader's attention away from the plough-boy's revealed body in order to make it clear the narrator evinces a manly control. When the sheet does fall, the narrator fixes the reader's attention on the Veil. "How softly the sheet falls to the ground!" Although the boy loses all agency ("the sheet falls") and his body disappears, there are still lingering erotic traces in the line's uncharacteristically Whitmanesque length, replete with a repetition of three separate and breathy exclamations. Voice the run-on line aloud, and hear the narrator's aspirated panting: "How soon," "How soon," "How softly."

<p>
When presented alone, African American res risk unfixing the virility by which Stevens measures a poet's historical force. A narrator who is reduced to panting does not provide an exemplary virile management of the racial subject for white consumption. In order to find some subject who can better model the possibilities for redefining gender by better controlling race issues, Stevens often turns outside the racialized turbulence of immediate domestic scenes to res of Hispanic&#8212;most specifically, Cuban&#8212;masculinity. When present in Stevensian texts that evoke blackness, Cuban res do the cultural work of binding the erotic excesses of racial difference.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Hispanic males function as North Americans' off-white brothers who can be invited into the national community and so prove that the boundaries defining "white masculinity" are somewhat malleable, even if texts exhibit adverse reactions to African American presences.



<b></b>

<p>

The earliest instance of Stevens's juxtaposition of African American and Hispanic tropes to negotiate masculinity occurs in a 1912 letter to Elsie, which tells of a circuitous walk from the Bronx's Van Cortlandt Park to Greenwich, Connecticut, and back to Manhattan (<i>LWS,</i> 177). The complexities of this private letter find resonances with his public poetry, so it is worthwhile to give this document some extended consideration. Stevens describes his marathon-length walk as a miniaturized gothic odyssey. "Walking through the dark, to a strange place, with that mystical lantern in the trees, I could hear the early bells, calling for vesper-services." The scene becomes more unsettling with the unexpected appearance of "two creeking stages full of negroes, returning from a pic-nic, with their arms etc. all intertwined." The strangers' unexpected arrival elicits an exaggerated sense of Stevens's seduction by, and even metamorphosis because of, their presence. "I flitted along-side unseen, for a long time, like a moth . . . I had my shirt turned back and my chemisette flung back, precisely like that corsair of hearts, le grand Byron, and I breathed!" By describing his metamorphosis through the image of a moth rather than the more conventional butterfly, Stevens emphasizes the significance of the <i>lure</i>, the raced subjects' erotic yet deadly flame. Drawn toward them, his body is set free (he "breathed!"), but such freedom can be fatal. The effeminate and accessorizing laciness of his imagined Byronic costume's loosened "chemisette" draws a close association between Stevens and the moth's textured wing; both are doomed because of their loss of will and their attractions to irresistable lures.

<p>
Prolonged erotic stimulation interrupts his epic walk and disrupts gender conventions, but Stevens confesses the need to hide his "exhilaration" upon returning to "town, and its sorrows, and civilities" so as to blend in "as neatly as anyone" and not alienate himself. He "put[s] a noose around [his] neck," a metaphor that evokes a more conventionally masculine accessory, a tie. Although it gestures toward an image of an urbane and comported businessman, this "noose" still recalls rather than eliminates race, enacting a symbolic self-lynching that exorcises the libidinal effects of his encounter with cultural difference. In order to become a better Manhattanite, Stevens assumes another masculine role. "In New York, I bought a piece of meat (wow-ow-oo-oo-ruh-r-r-r!) and a Belinda perfecto and limped down the Avenue, looking like a Spanish gentleman, and blowing great rings of smoke, lighted home&#8212;still by that heavenly flame." A return to an acceptable, "civilized" masculinity is made possible with the guise of "a Spanish gentleman." The letter's absurdity and eeriness is amplified by his confession that he "bought a piece of meat" and a Cuban cigar, phallic accessories that complete his masculine costume. His comic yet disturbing growl reveals that the erotic effects have not subsided even long after he returns home and composes the letter. The chemisette marks the erotic allure of the "stages full of negroes," a sign of the encounter's feminizing eroticism and of how the racialized presence obviates all recognizable gender limits. The Spanish costume's phallic props are more recognizably masculine, but Stevens's performance fails to pass because a symptomatic growl signifies a persistent and uncontainable eroticism, something about gender that still lies beyond his performative control.

<p>
Over the course of his career, he refines the 1912 mask of the "Spanish gentleman" and shifts his Hispanic res from Iberian to more identifiably Latin American representations.
<b></b>
Latin American and Caribbean res recur in Stevens's poetic oeuvre, and their functions shift from poem to poem and from period to period during his career.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 In <i>Harmonium</i> (1923, revised 1931) and <i>Ideas of Order</i> , he specifically deploys that Hispanic culture with which he was most "familiar"&#8212;the Cuban&#8212;to shore up a sense of poetic virility.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 This southward turn, though, introduces new complications that exacerbate rather than mitigate the social asymmetries underlying his gender project. As Louis Zukofsky once remarked, even the most imaginative of Stevens's poems "somehow suffered the history of the Americas."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 By and large, Stevens is open to the possibility that Cuban cultural differences need not be interpreted as power hierarchies. The "base" for his imagining, however, is founded upon North American ideologies and practices of imperialism. Despite his best intentions, his work is limited by the material realities of economic and cultural imperialism; his narrators often exhibit a need to manage <i>lo cubano</i> (Cubanness) in order to ensure that it does not produce unbecoming destabilizations of white masculinity resembling those effected by black res. Eroticisms and perversions still surface as symptoms of the impotence of Stevens's virile poet and of his inability to allay very real social asymmetries.

Cuba, the Platt Amendment, and the Historical Basis for National Poetic Virility 
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Stevens's frequent recreational and working vacations to Key West did establish an early attraction to nearby Cuba, an interest augmented by his two visits to the island nation in 1923 and then renewed by his correspondence with essayist, translator, and editor Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez Feo in 1944. His private fascination, however, provides insufficient explanation for why Cuba is culturally important to his pursuit of the virile American poet. In fact, we can get a better sense of Stevens's "private" fascination if we situate it in a "public" socio-historical context that structures his desire. Cuba itself was an object of the United States' imperial desire long before <i>Harmonium</i>'s publication. Throughout the nineteenth century, the U.S. was not at ease with Spain's strong colonial presence on the Caribbean island since Cuba's close proximity posed a security threat and the colonial government prohibited the expansion of North American foreign markets. Since the start of the Ten Years' War in 1868, Congress openly debated whether it was in the best interest of the U.S. to annex Cuba or to help it win its sovereignty. The debate would not be resolved until the Spanish-American War of 1898, in which President William McKinley spearheaded the anticolonial war effort to quell nationalist activity that threatened to prevent the U.S. from ever developing market interests in Cuba.

<p>
After the war's conclusion, the United States sought to protect its political and economic investments in the Cuban Republic by appending the Platt Amendment to the new nation's 1901 constitution. Historian Louis A. P&eacute;rez, Jr., notes that the Platt Amendment embodied an "adequate if imperfect substitute for annexation" because "it served to transform the substance of Cuban sovereignty into an extension of the U.S. national system."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Politically, the legislation rendered the island vulnerable to military intervention 
<b></b>
and intercessions in the development of foreign policy. Economically, it promoted an early form of neoliberal expansion and lay the groundwork for the Reciprocity Treaty of 1903, which "accelerated the integration of the Cuban economy into the North American system" by eliminating tariffs and flooding the Cuban market with U.S. capital and goods (<i>C,</i> 122). Land speculation increased, followed by what P&eacute;rez calls "the onset of large-scale colonization schemes" that resulted in the establishment of "agricultural colonies"(<i>C,</i> 123, 124). North Americans' economic and cultural presence produced what the historian elsewhere refers to as "ambivalence and antagonism" concerning "the means by which Cubans experienced cultural authenticity." He elaborates, "So thoroughly had North American forms penetrated the structural order of daily life that it was often almost impossible to make a sharp distinction between what was properly 'Cuban' and what was 'North American.'"
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>


<p>
Although P&eacute;rez focuses almost exclusively on how the North American presence affected Cuban national culture and identity, his documentation of nineteenth-century annexation debates and early-twentieth-century expansionist activity provides a correlative sense of how the Caribbean nation impacted the North American cultural imaginary. In both countries, contentions over the Platt Amendment gave rise to accusations of U.S. imperialism, resulting in the growth of a confused public discourse about the nature of imperialism. In order to get a brief impression of this open discourse during Stevens's early period, we need only turn to a 1928 publication by political scientist Leland Hamilton Jenks.

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
It is my firm belief that these facts [about the nature of Cuba's relationship to the U.S.] are not well understood in the United States . . . I have myself encountered an American Master of Arts who thought Cuba was a territory, an infantry sergeant who thought the island was in 1926 occupied by American troops, a Washington official who thought that Havana was a seaport of the United States. The relations between Cuba and the United States have been such, or have been so construed, that it is a widespread popular belief that Cuba is part of an incipient American Empire.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
When trying to clear up the public's confusion, Jenks refuses to characterize Cuban-U.S. relations as imperialist largely because he feels that "Cuba's story is only incidentally a matter of politics. It is fundamentally a matter of economics."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 It is fallacious, however, to distinguish between political and economic modes of imperialism, and U.S. policies at the turn of the century evince a desire to protect <i>both</i> its political and economic vested interests. Each of Jenks's supposedly misguided interviewees actually grasps different aspects of the North American presence in Cuba, a presence that the Platt Amendment rendered what might be called <i>ambivalently imperialist</i> until its 1934 repeal by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. During the first three decades of Cuba's independence, the United States repeatedly reinterpreted this "organic document," as P&eacute;rez calls it, in order to justify military interventions that aided successive Cuban regimes' defense against nationalist, anti-imperialist insurgences that would threaten North American market and political influences; yet the rhetoric of the document and of political pundits supported the spirit of anticolonialism and Cuban independence.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>




<b></b>


<p>
For the duration of the Platt Amendment, public discourses revised U.S. borders, which oscillated between inclusion and exclusion of Cuba. The document's general intent was to establish a Cuban protectorate, and two of its articles especially contributed to the indeterminacy of what we now, in this age of NAFTA, presume to be firmly established (and heavily defended) national boundaries. The anticipated migration of residents and consumer goods between Florida and Cuba rendered boundaries so permeable that the legislators who drafted the amendment saw fit to mandate the improvement of Cuban cities' sanitation systems in Article V, "thereby assuring protection to the people and commerce of Cuba, as well as to the commerce of the southern ports of the United States and of the people residing therein." Article VI designates the Isle of Pines, located off the Cuban mainland's southwest shore, as a nationless limbo. The isle "shall be omitted from the proposed constitutional boundaries of Cuba, the title thereto being left to further adjustment by treaty." This article left the determination of the Caribbean republic's boundaries contingent on the unpredictable needs of its North American "protector." It was only after the Isle of Pines' harbors were discovered to be too shallow for a naval base that Congress ratified the Hay-Quesada Treaty in 1925 and remanded proprietorship to Cuba.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>


<p>
The Platt Amendment's legislation of mutable borders continued to have felt effects on both nations long after its repeal. Novelist and cultural philosopher Waldo Frank remarks that F. D. R.'s repeal was only a symbolic though "well-intentioned" gesture because "the dependence of Cuba on the United States was by then a structural fact which only a blow against the structure itself could shatter."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 That blow would not come until the Cuban Revolution of 1959, four years after Stevens's death. The clear infrastructural, political, and cultural boundaries existing between the two nations today are products of that fateful break. Cultural differences now are so sharply defined that they make it difficult to recall or even to imagine the extent to which these two countries' geopolitical boundaries were once subject to flux. For the entirety of his life, however, Stevens knew Cuba only as a space that simultaneously existed <i>both</i> as a part of and apart from a North American cultural identity.

<p>
As Jenks's study exemplifies, there was enough indeterminate discussion about the ambivalent status of Cuba's relationship to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s for writers and other cultural producers to trope the island in order to address seemingly unconnected domestic issues. To do so, writers needed to resolve for themselves what Cuba "was." For Stevens, the island nation was both inside and outside his imagined North American community. In order to contain any possibly disruptive eroticism, Stevens imagines Cuba as an exotic space of ontological difference outside U.S. borders; set apart, his narrators effectively manage the difference originating in this space. In order for Cuba to retain any utility for his domestic project, though, it is more common for Stevens to play with the idea that Florida might serve as a metonym evoking the long-debated possibility of Cuba's annexation. Because the Platt Amendment rendered national boundaries fluid and permeable, the archipelago of the Florida Keys is easily imagined as forming a "borderlands" that blurs national limits and extends North American cultural spaces into Cuban territories. A foreignness, then, can 
<b></b>
be found on domestic soil. Stevens plays with the ambivalences opened in definitions of national integrity, determining when and how it would be "safe" for him to evoke Cuban cultural difference when constructing the re of a more virile (North) American (white) poet, with a minimum of reference to political asymmetries.

<p>
Before I discuss Stevens's Floridean borderlands, I will close this section with one example of his poetic containment and distancing of Cuban culture. In his poem "The Revolutionists Stop for Orangeade" (c.1930), Stevens dehistoricizes Cuba, erasing evidence of the material conditions of neoliberal expansion and Cuban nationalists' insurrection, in order to render the island nation a more plastic poetic resource.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Ironically, this puts him at odds with his own imperative that poetry register social reality (albeit a reality filtered through the imagination). His struggle to trope <i>lo cubano</i> produces an ambivalent synthesis that can recognize the social realities of imperialism only by comically refashioning them so that this foreign space might become a "harmless" site in which he stages his poetic imaginary.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Because his poem has been included in the <i>Collected Poems</i>' version of <i>Harmonium,</i> the chronology of its composition may be misleading. Joan Richardson includes "Revolutionists" among those poems written around 1930 for inclusion in the second Knopf edition of <i>Harmonium</i> , seven years after the first edition's 1923 publication.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 The poem's chronology is significant in that it underscores how Stevens imaginatively revises events of his social "base" to demonstrate his poetic virility.

<p>
Who are the original historical "revolutionists" to whom the title refers? Determining their identity necessitates reading the poem through the narrator's polyglot speech. Spanish words enter his lexicon&#8212;"capit&aacute;n," "profundo," "pomposo"&#8212;all of which are homophonic calques of English words (captain, profound, pompous). Anomalous words&#8212; "bellissimo" and "geloso"&#8212;that are not from the foreign idiom also appear. The Spanish equivalent for the superlative "most beautiful" would be "bell&iacute;smo," not "bellissimo." Stevens seems to confuse an Italian cognate with a Spanish one; after all, he was very frank about not having much knowledge of Spanish.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 "Geloso" is also an Italian term (the Spanish is "celoso"). If one were to pronounce "geloso" not as a native speaker (x&eacute;!lo!so) but as an English speaker (g&eacute;l!ous!o), then it would "sound" like a homophonic "translation" of "jealous." Stevens's neologistic homophone indicates a forcible introduction of Spanish (or Spanglish) despite his lack of familiarity with the language, the adoption of which indicates that the revolutionaries are either from the populist Mexican Revolution (1910-17) or one of Cuba's many nationalist resurrections. The latter is more likely given the time of the poem's composition. After his 1925 election, the administration of Cuban president Gerardo Machado faced much opposition because he amended the constitution to extend his presidential term, conducted antilabor movement campaigns, imprisoned political opponents, and ignored high unemployment produced by the global depression of 1929 and the subsequent inflation of U.S. tariffs on Cuban exports. Insurgences included an aborted revolution in 1931&#8212;the year when Stevens's poem appeared in the revised version of <i>Harmonium</i>. The Cuban political crisis would have been very much on the minds of Stevens and his readers.



<b></b>

<p>
Encrypted in the poem's title lies a reactionary headline&#8212;"Revolutions Stop Foreign Aid." The pun of the title registers how interventionist policies often were presented as "foreign aid" intended to help a newly liberated nation maintain its supposed sovereignty. The ludicrous situation of revolutionists stopping for orangeade introduces the reader to a site of leisure in which Stevens's narrator functions as a mask through which the poet can play with a foreign tongue. But there is a gravity, what the narrator calls "pith," in such linguistic play. His parodic interpretation of the Spanish idiom is a substitute for the revolutionary role that defines the narrator and his peers. By questioning the captain's demand that the soldiers "sing standing in the sun," the narrator postpones and intervenes in the battle. As an alternative activity, he suggests a "song of serpent-kin" sung in a costume of "clownish boots," "breeches," a "Coat half-flare and half galloon," and a "helmet." The coat is to be only "half galloon" (half trimmed by lace or metallic embroidery) and "half-flare[d]." Its incompleteness suggests an impoverished version of an outmoded, seventeenth-century Spanish colonial fashion. The helmet is to be worn "without reason, / Tufted, tilted, twirled, and twisted," a dandyesque accessory, complete with the extravagant nonchalance of "a feather by your eye." By introducing a vaudevillian lapse into a leisurely yet "pithy" play with recognizable signs of Spanish conquistador culture, the narrator interrupts the revolution that historically could have unseated Machado. When a revolution would succeed in 1933, the Cuban Republic's sovereignty would be disabled, resulting in a North American intervention that would usher in the proliferation of goods and influences in political and economic markets. The anachronistic choice of costume itself is significant since it suggests the narrator's neocolonial identification yet interrupts an anticolonial and anti-imperial epic political moment "in the sun" and even prevents the eventual development of a North American neocolonialism.

<p>
We cannot read "Revolutionists" as either an endorsement or protest of any international politics. Stevens maintains an ambivalent political stance because his primary objective in this poem is to produce an imaginary space that revisions embodied masculinity in a domestic space. It is strange that the narrator of "Revolutionists" first suggests "the breeches of a mask" for the parodic costume. Covering, costuming, and masking the body's nether-regions forcibly circumscribes the male subject's eroticism. Whereas the body would be put on well-lit display in all its corporeality ("Hairy-backed and hump-armed, / Flat-ribbed and big-bagged") if the captain's command were to be carried out, the narrator imagines hiding a borderline grotesque male physique under a costume's shabby finery and outdated extravagance. It may be dandyesque, but the performance also includes "singing in a voice / Rougher than a grinding shale," a hypermasculine vocality that counteracts any effeminate associations with a failed colonial enterprise. Vaudeville itself is a <i>North American</i> cultural form popularized abroad during this time in such Havana cabarets as the Tropicana, which catered to North American and European tourists. The revolutionist's suggested vaudeville refashions colonialism and imperialism so that it loses political significance and better suits the aesthetic interests of a North American masculine subject whose sense of gender identity could be compromised if the anatomical "base" of virility&#8212;the male body itself&#8212;is laid bare for all to see.



<b></b>

<p>

Most probably, the nullification of the historical potential of Cuban insurgence is an imperialist effect, not an intent, of Stevens's poem. His primary interest lies in shoring up North American poetic masculinity. The unruliness of the revolutionist's body has less to do with international politics than it does with gender constructs. The narrator's conquistador mask functions in a similar way to the sheet of "The Silver Plough-Boy": both try to erase the observed male re's physicality, yet end up calling attention to it. In "Revolutionists," the narrator's reference to "serpent-kin" evokes an Edenic stage, a mythological space antedating historical and political time. The narrator is not only Adamic because he tries to control his surroundings through a poetic naming but also because he is subject to temptation and the awakening of desire. The song he desires to hear will be delivered by vocalists who wrap their "Tongues around the fruit," an alimentary and sexually suggestive image that continues the Edenic conceit and reminds us that the song's sheer staginess would put his and other males' bodies front-and-center. The narrator keeps emphasizing the details of the gaudy costume in an attempt to shift attention away from the performing bodies and toward the exotic and paradisal production of a Cuban romance.

<p>
Evidently, Stevens is struggling to move beyond things as they are. In order to make this performance of <i>lo cubano</i> a successful tool for revising North American masculinity, the revolutionist's charming and harmless comic relief must minimize any real political threat to the prevailing social order, whether that order be under the auspices of Machado or an intervening North American protectorate. Instead of political threats and crises, "Revolutionists" performs cultural difference in a romanticized way that allows the reader to imagine new possibilities for masculinity. But the poem's surface play with language and its performative gender roles are themselves enabled by an ambivalent dependence on an imperialist "base." In some ways, the poem's ideological composition is not unlike a legislative structure like the Platt Amendment, which disavows imperialist asymmetries even while enacting them. To insist on the "breeches of a mask," to disguise a cultural rift (breach) under fantastic costuming (breeches), Stevens puts himself at odds with his own imperative that we measure the poet's virility by the historical force of his work. His revolutionist's strategy of aestheticizing the battle at hand is escapist, rather than epic, and it produces an unsatisfactory and counterintuitive Edenic mythos. The dramatic assemblage of the poem suggests that Stevens needs to lay bare the mechanics and material conditions of history, but the suggested performance is caught between an incompleteness that would produce a Brechtian alienation effect and an unwitting revelation of the poet's own motivating anxieties. In later poems, Stevens reduces his mythologizing tendencies by producing Cuban interlocutors transplanted from the Caribbean's political turbulence into the securely domestic yet topographically "foreign" space of the Floridean borderlands. In that topography, his white and Hispanic interlocutors form a community that embodies a spectrum of whiteness and renders new "American" masculinities imaginable.

Stevens's Florida Poems and the Borderlands of American Modernism 
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Rethinking the relationship between American modernisms and imperialism demands a reconsideration of the "borderlands" and other key critical concepts from border theory and postcolonial studies. In her theory of subaltern resistance in the Southwest, Gloria Anzald&uacute;a defines a borderland as "a vague and undetermined place created by the emotional residue of an unnatural boundary. It is in a constant state of transition. The prohibited and forbidden are its inhabitants."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 The indeterminism of this space is embodied by the mestiza, an interracial female re whose "plural personality" allows her to adapt to her changing environment "by developing a tolerance for contradictions, a tolerance for ambiguity," and by "learn[ing] to juggle cultures."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Whereas feminist, queer, and Chicano/a studies have found Anzald&uacute;a's borderlands theory invaluable because it posits a site and mode of cultural resistance, modernist studies can equally benefit from her observation that these are forcibly produced cultural and geographical territories that owe their existence to material and discursive histories of expansionism and neoliberalism.

<p>
Jos&eacute; David Sald&iacute;var refers to the borderlands as a "<i>transfrontera</i> contact zone," a "social space of subaltern encounters, the Janus-faced border line in which peoples geopolitically forced to separate themselves now negotiate with one another and manufacture new relations, hybrid cultures, and multiple-voiced aesthetics."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Sald&iacute;var stresses that hybridity and cultural negotiations are rooted in "the <i>uneven</i> power relations between national entities" (<i>BM,</i> 14; emphasis added). In his analysis of the writings of the nineteenth-century re Captain John Gregory Bourke, he suggests that North American ethnographic discourses have historically reinforced cultural asymmetries through an "objectification of everything alien and weird and exotic about the contact group"(<i>BM,</i> 166). Most frequently, Sald&iacute;var argues, that reification is accomplished through Africanist tropes which, thanks to ethnographic anthropology and colonialist expedition, are culturally legible as representational modes grounded in power hierarchies. Bourke Africanizes the borderlands' indigenous population and topography, and so projects his primacy as observer and generates a decontextualization of both "the African jungle and the <i>frontera</i> of Nuestra Am&eacute;rica [that] all but effaces the local inhabitants of both continents"(<i>BM,</i> 167). Well into the era of literary modernism, poets as diverse as Stevens, Hart Crane, Elizabeth Bishop, and Charles Olson negotiate the strategies and asymmetries of representing cultural differences in the Americas via Africanist tropes.

<p>
Stevens presents a peculiar case because his "fabliau of Florida" exoticizes the southern borderlands in order to render tropicality more familiar to white North American audiences. During his first visit to Miami in 1916, Stevens wrote to his wife that he thought Florida was foundationally strange and alien, but one could quickly adapt to the terrain's apparent tropical differences. "You soon grow accustomed to the palms. The soil is utterly different from ours" (<i>LWS,</i> 192). Two days later he would feel comfortable enough to conclude that "Florida is not really amazing in itself but in what it becomes under cultivation," and adds that "the ordinary jungle is not impressive" (ibid<i>.</i>). Unlike the Africanist primitivism of "The Greenest Continent" (<i>Owl's Clover,</i> 1936), 
<b></b>
Stevens's Floridean "jungle" does not resemble "spangling greens," nor is it populated by "fallen forest-men / Forever hunting or hunted" in "the jungle shine"; indeed, Florida is curiously depopulated (<i>OP,</i> 86). Without an indigenous or a racialized population, Stevens can turn it into a screen upon which he can poetically project his own desires. It is a tabula rasa which he imagines to be set apart from the rest of the South and free of the unnerving racial encounters that Stevens experiences during his travels elsewhere.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 As such, Stevens can "cultivate" Florida and enlist it as a space where he might address the gender dimensions of his national project, a space where he can prove that the virility of his ideal modernist poet is unimpeded by the specters of race.

<p>
But race is not wholly erased; instead, the space of Florida itself assumes traces of racial overdetermination due to Stevens's persistent use of primitivist tropes. For instance, the narrator of "Fabliau of Florida" (c.1919) tries to sublimate race by urging a "Barque of phosphor" harbored at "the palmy beach," "Fill your black hull / With white moonlight" (<i>CP,</i> 23). He orders the ship's platonic transformation to "Move outward into heaven," to ascend from sea to sky, from reality to image. As it moves from a tableau to a fabliau, the ship leaves behind the scene's "black" social foundations. In its wake, "Sultry moon-monsters / Are dissolving," an observation that poetically associates actual climate conditions with an eroticized fairy-tale monstrosity. In these two short lines, Stevens strongly invokes <i>The Tempest,</i> a romance of art's confrontation with colonialism, slavery, and resistance. His "moon-monsters" allude to Shakespeare's Caliban, the "mooncalf" of African descent (his mother, Sycorax, was exiled from Algiers), enslaved by Prospero for his attempted rape of Miranda. Because the "Sultry moon-monsters / Are dissolving," the narrator seems to have achieved a mastery of Prospero's art. Unlike the magus whose artful masque dissolves when he suddenly remembers Caliban's revolution (Act IV Scene 1), Stevens's narrator claims an art strong enough to dissolve the reminders of the social conditions' racial strife before it has a chance to interrupt the poem's aesthetic magic. Yet the apparent ease with which the poem seems to transcend the realities and romances of race is belied by the simple fact that the image is actually an illusion that will need to be repeated. "There will never be an end / To this droning of the surf." Florida's realities persist and supply an inevitable and inarticulate "droning" that will always have to be artfully sublimated. There is no reason to read blackness in the "droning of the surf," but the Floridean space becomes racialized by the same art and literary allusions used by Stevens to wipe it clean of signs of social strife.

<p>
Elsewhere, Stevens minimizes primitivism's racialized traces by relying less on romance and forcible literary transformation and instead realistically incorporating the cross-cultural elements of this borderlands. In a sense, the poet tries to let the borderlands speak for itself. In the apostrophic ode, "O Florida, Venereal Soil" (c.1922), Stevens attempts to salvage a catalog of "A few things for themselves," which will allow the borderlands to attest to his poetic virility without his need to resort to primitivist metaphor and its instantiation of racial asymmetries (<i>CP,</i> 47-8). The narrator prods Florida to speak of flora and fauna drawn from a variety of American spaces, ranging from a New England meadow to the Southwestern desert to the Florida Keys: "Convolvulus 
<b></b>
and coral, / Buzzards and live-moss, / Tiestas from the keys." Collected in the borderlands, these nouns are no longer mere natural markers of regional American identities; their juxtaposition accentuates how they could insinuate death and sexuality. "Vulva" is encrypted in "convolvulus" (herbs from the morning glory family), and the enigmatic "tiestas" misappropriates Spanish (<i>tiestos</i> are earthenware flowerpots) and encrypts the male genitals ("testes"). Gender and cultural differences are legible on the very surface of the words depicting North America's topographical heterogeneity, but their bricolage on Florida's "venereal soil" only subtly inflects them with undesired qualities. We hear erotic murmurs of the gender concerns underlying Stevens's poetic, but nothing is particularly indicative of his perpetuation of gendered power structures.

<p>
It would be fallacious to rely on the feminine personification of the landscape as an argument for the poem's apparent gender asymmetries. After all, Florida resists and refuses to give the narrator the sort of confession of her "nature" that he solicits. <i>Her</i> list of "A few things for themselves" details ethnic and racial populations, the "dreadful sundry of this world." Her answer exposes the narrator as desiring natural history so that his poem might avoid the perils of demographic documentation and undesirable social hierarchies. She tells him of,



<blockquote>

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the huddled masses who pass through Ellis Island, Florida's "dreadful sundry" are foreign presences that surface from within an American milieu. Personified as a "Virgin of boorish births," the borderlands nurtures a diverse ethnic brood that ranges from archetypes (The Cuban) to named individuals (Polodowsky). The African American "undertaker" is the most storied re. Handling dead bodies and fishes to "kill" a time measured in "corpses," his ominous and racialized presence produces a fatal distraction. Indeed, the ineluctable caesura visually manifest in the ellipse almost brings the poem to a premature end by forcing the amorous narrator into a preternatural pause. If the borderlands speaks for itself, it risks producing a distinctly American narrative of ethnic and racial diversity, but its "boorish" (swine-like, crude, insensitive) cultural production risks generating an undesirable, absolute foreignness proximate to aesthetic death.

<p>
Stevens's narrator rails against Florida, charging her with full responsibility for the racialized catalog. "Lasciviously as the wind, / You come tormenting, / Insatiable." His accusations confuse eroticism for the <i>cause</i> of the appearance of disidentificatory racialism when eroticism actually is an <i>effect</i> of the poet's decision to cultivate Florida as an erotic space, to project a venereal persona upon the borderlands' landscape. Stevens's invocation of William Carlos Williams indicates that even the lyric modernist desires an objectivist ideal for poetry, to become a "scholar of darkness" removed from a domestic racial scene and able to reflect upon it at a comfortable distance in tranquility. Spaces cannot 
<b></b>
speak for themselves if the poet is to fulfill his virile role as a forger of national identity. The disappointed narrator assumes an authoritative voice in the last stanza to control this "Donna, donna, dark." "Conceal yourself or disclose / Fewest things to the lover." In the end, neither option&#8212;to clothe her racialized "dark" self or to restrict what she discloses&#8212;is on the table. Florida is only allowed to "disclose" one thing: "A hand that bears a thick-leaved fruit, / A pungent bloom against your shade." An incredible masturbatory image, this onanistic phallus, under the direct control of the poetic hand, shields the narrator from and is wielded "against" the "shade" of Florida's proximity to American racial realities.

<p>
The borderlands do not provide a reliable resource that will corroborate one's poetic virility like a good "lover" because it nurtures unpredictable cultural differences with which a white audience may not be able to identify. Even if difference is born in a domestic American space, Stevens's target audience is not reflected in its archetypes ("The Cuban," "The Mexican women") or in its meaningless names lacking biographies ("Polodowsky"); the narrative of the only re possessing a semblance of a story ("the negro undertaker") is so moribund that it actually encourages the audience's disidentification. In order to make Florida useful, Stevens decides to align its tropical elements more closely with a Hispanic presence. These ethnically different actors can speak on Florida's behalf, preemptively disabling any erotic eruptions that make it evident that the poet has lost control of his subject as so happens when his actors are African American. Just as the boundaries between the two nations existed in a state of relative flux for three decades because of the Platt Amendment, cultural differences between <i>lo norteamericano</i> and <i>lo cubano</i> are permeable rather than absolute in Stevens's poetry during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The borderlands becomes a more familiar space, whose occupants provide res with whom Stevens's target readers can relate and with whom they might even be able to identify themselves. He moves away from primitivist representational strategies toward a <i>populating</i> strategy, which places Hispanic res on the same poetic stage as his white narrators.

<p>
Often his narrators urge Hispanic res to speak, an ability which would distinguish them from most of his African American res. Simple conversation promises to open possibilities for a truly intersubjective exchange that could have positive consequences for expanding definitions of American masculinity. In his early experiments with such staged dialogues, the poet relies upon indeterminate markers of racial difference that reproduce power structures and ultimately prevent Caribbean subjects who are still linked to a primitivist Floridean topography from speaking for themselves. One early example of such frustrated communication occurs in <i>Harmonium</i>'s "Two res in Dense Violet Night"  (<i>CP,</i> 85-6). The poem's speaker encourages the other, "Be the voice of night and Florida in my ear. / Use dusky words and dusky images. / Darken your speech." The racial implications of such "dusky words" are apparent, and they signal Stevens's consciousness that his social project might benefit from an appropriation of racial dialect that transgressively incorporates cultural difference and demonstrates the author's sovereign control over his materials.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Yet, he retracts the request right after he makes it.

<b></b>
<p>
Instead, the narrator opts to imagine an intercourse that refines his interlocutor's actual speech, and he "Conceiv[es] words" and speaks "perfectly" on the other's behalf, "in [his] thoughts." Using only the barest of resources, including the seascape's "<i>droning</i> sibilants" (emphasis added) (reminiscent of "the drone of the surf" in "Fabliau of Florida"), he is able to imagine a "serenade." The speaker even puts words into his companion's mouth: "<i>Say,</i> puerile, that the buzzards crouch on the ridge-pole," "<i>Say</i> that the palms are clear in a total blue" (emphasis added). Lacking sense ("the palms . . . / Are clear and are obscure") and erasing traces of the actual setting's sibilants (aspirated "s" sounds only occur in "say" and "obscure"), the narrator models a form of speech that evinces his power and command of language but fails to communicate any message. The reader may perceive a virile poetic potency, but how does such prosperous artfulness affect American social structures?

<p>
Set in that part of the South where Stevens rarely takes notice of African Americans, it is plausible that "Two res" wants to introduce a different sort of "native" speech&#8212;an hispanicized speech of the borderlands. However, the mere suggestion that such a Caribbean speech is "darken[ed]" disrupts the possibility of establishing Florida as a stable site from which Stevens might produce a poetic virility, to say what he and his narrator want said. Metaphorically rendered as an exercise in "<i>Conceiving</i> words, // As the night <i>conceives</i> the sea-sounds in silence" (emphasis added) the solicited process of shared poetic production is overdetermined by an insistence that this joint effort be reproductive, a <i>conception</i> rather than a <i>conceptualization</i>. Although we have no positive affirmation of the silent re's gender, the word "puerile" could be read as an appositive that bears Latinate traces of "boy" (<i>puer</i>). By forcibly maintaining the respondent's silence, the narrator wards off unnatural verbal intercourse, a consequence that would be as unseemly as taking the boy's "moist hand." His solicitation of "darken[ed]" speech is nothing less than a proposition, a language-game proposed in lieu of an averted intimacy between two res. If this is a scene intended to confirm poetic virility, it falls rather short of its goal. It is culturally comprehensible as "virile" only because the narrator wards off another male's possible sexual advances. This spurning does not truly straighten the narrator, though, since he continues to play flirtatious games that barely sublimate their meeting's erotic excesses. After all, he does ask his companion to whisper his racialized speech "in my ear"!

<p>
In his later writing, Stevens attempts to refine the failed dialogic model of "Two res" through explicitly Hispanic characters. If the interlocutors are visible, unobscured by any "dense violet night," the social significances of their interactions might be more legible and less subject to scurrilous interpretation. Consequently, they would provide more suitable testimony to the poet's virility. <i>Ideas of Order</i> is the apogee of Stevens's integration of Caribbean topoi into his poetry. No longer a disguise or a mask (as in "Revolutionists") or an archetype ("The Cuban" of "O Florida, Venereal Soil") or an implied presence (as in "Two res"), <i>lo cubano</i> is embodied as a distinct character who is addressed, engaged, and (most importantly) named. Preserving the integrity of Cuban individuals is tantamount to inviting them into a democratic exchange between familiars. In these poems, poetic virility is achieved by nurturing a 
<b></b>
cultural pluralism that reaches across the republics' boundaries to invite cross-cultural identifications, rather than insisting upon an overly controlling homogenization of American culture.

<p>
In "Academic Discourse at Havana" (c.1933), Stevens constructs intimate and personalized characterizations of Cuban individuals that facilitate a white reader's identification with a more expansive American community (<i>CP,</i> 142-5).  For instance, when he writes that "Grandmother and her basketful of pears / Must be the crux of our compendia," he suggests a kinship between the narrator and this woman simply by calling her "Grandmother." Due to the narrator's familiar and familial address, she is no longer apart from North American communities but connected to them via the transcultural poetic liason of the narrator. If the poet is able to preserve cultural difference without eradicating cross-identification, there is social legitimacy and virility to be found in poetic enterprise. The historical potency of the poet is guaranteed because he opens up vistas for reimagining national identity rather than constructing enclosures and exclusions that delimit identities and create rifts between factions of the national community. Surrendering some control, giving the individual reader's imagination more room for free play, reflects positively upon Stevens's primary concern for expanding the poet's culturally legible masculinity. In "Academic Discourse," the poet's speech really can stir his audience. "But let the poet on his balcony / Speak and the sleepers in their sleep shall move."

<p>
"The Idea of Order at Key West" (c.1935) moves the cross-cultural vignettes of "Academic Discourse at Havana" off the Cuban isle and into the Floridean borderlands (<i>CP,</i> 128-30). The narrator twice calls by name the Hispanic re with whom he shares his reflections on an anonymous singing woman. First, he is directly addressed as "Ramon Fernandez," a significant announcement of his ethnicity.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 When he is named a second time, he is simply called "pale Ramon." The modifier "pale" is superfluous in the poem's context of a casual conversation, but it does mark a difference in Ramon's and the narrator's complexions and indicates the interlocutor's <i>criollo</i> rather than possibly African descent. Ramon doubles for Stevens's own audience, the re with whom readers might identify and thereby implicitly expand the possibilities of North American readership. Stevens feels so secure in his narrator's distance from racial disturbances that the conversation is presented as a reflection upon a past event ("She sang beyond the genius of the sea"). If the poet felt that ethnic difference threatened the stability of his narrator's lyric position or his audience's ability to identify with Ramon, Stevens could have written about the spectacle as staged in the present. Two heterosexual men enraptured by, or perhaps struggling over, a common female object would defuse possible homoerotic readings inspired by perceived erotic excesses in a racially overdetermined relationship.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Coexisting without any need for the narrator to assert masculine superiority, the two res of "The Idea of Order at Key West" establish a vignette in which the borderlands is for once devoid of erotic symptoms of racial strife and social disorder.

<p>
The singing woman supplies reinforcing proof that it is possible to transform "venereal" Florida into a neutral American site. Because of her skill, her song and the waves 
<b></b>
remain independent entities, and the landscape is not touched by nor does it adversely affect aesthetic composition. "The water never formed to mind or voice, / Like a body wholly body, fluttering / Its empty sleeves." The songstress's identity as artist is not imperiled by the site at which she sings. "[S]he was the maker of the song she sang," and "The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea / Was merely a place by which she walked to sing." The spatially denotative prepositional phrases in the poem (the "at Key West" of the title; the "place by which she walked" above) do not bear any additional significances. Compositional sites are merely the locations of cultural production; as such, Stevens seems to have hit upon a depiction of the borderlands from which he might construct a virile poetic without stirring up destabilizing racial hierarchies or using primitivist tropes.

<p>
By describing the formless sea as "Like a body wholly body," the narrator acknowledges the fecund materiality of nature; yet he manages to negate its influence on the woman's song by using a simile that reduces the sea to an object that merely resembles a body. Because the sea waves its "empty sleeves," its materiality is erased and eroticism is inoculated. Stevens produces a sound stage of the borderlands where he can enact his gender drama in "Theatrical distances." Performed in this space, the woman's song is "more" than "the dark voice of the sea / That rose, or even colored by many waves." Descriptions of the setting as "dark" and "colored" register a racial presence, but the doubled sense of the verb "rose" suggests that the chanteuse widens the spectrum so that "color" moves beyond racial and toward aesthetic significances. Her ability to separate herself from a racialized and embodied borderlands is visually reinforced by an amazing linear disjunction:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
[. . .] But it was more than that,


<br />
More even than her voice, and ours, among

<br />
The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,

<br />
Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped

<br />
On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres

<br />
Of sky and sea.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was her voice that made

<br />
The sky acutest at its vanishing.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The geography's "dark voice" and its "meaningless plungings of water and the wind" evoke a sexual thrusting, but this sonic and copulative "plunging" is just "meaningless" murmuring that contrasts with the woman's articulate song, "uttered word by word." Since she has managed to keep her song distinct from and more audible than the soundscape ("it was she and not the sea we heard"), Florida is just a scenic backdrop of "bronze shadows," another indication of how her performance moves beyond racial toward aesthetic coloration. The two sources of sound are visually set apart by the fissuring of the line, where Stevens dramatically separates the background noise "Of sky and / sea" from "her voice." There is no danger, neither aurally nor visually, that race and aesthetics might mix: "The song and water were not medleyed sound."

<p>
The woman's song has a generative power not unlike the potent power of Stevens's idealized virile poet. She is "the single artificer of the world / <i>In</i> which she sang" (emphasis added), <b></b> and her act of aesthetic production creates her own space. Although her song is a theatrical production like the mythopoetic performance proposed in "Revolutionists," her song does not detract attention away from political events; instead, she masters her actual surroundings and endows "whatever self" the sea once had with a new identity, "the self / That was her song, for she was the maker." Furthermore, her song demonstrates an historical force because it continues to affect the narrator's and Ramon's imaginations. But her positive example raises more questions than it answers: Why is the most potent and "virile" of Stevens's early poet-res a woman? And why is it necessary for "pale Ramon" to be present at all if Stevens wants his narrator only to bear witness to the potency of her song?

<p>
The complexities of this meditation on the borderlands as a space of virile poetic production hinge on the poem's mediated nature, how the text itself intervenes in the reader's perception of the phenomenological event described by the narrator. Such graphic indicators as the fractured line that syntactically and graphically segregates "her voice" from the "sky and sea" draw the reader's attention to the degree to which Stevens manages his poetic material. As the narrator remarks, "it was more than that, / More even than her voice, and ours, among / The meaningless plungings of water and the wind" that lends her song its historical force. The poet is the external force who arranges the poem's telling; Stevens himself is the "more than that" who endows his materials force and supercedes the re of the singing woman as "the maker of the song she sang." Not unlike the mythic Orpheus, her song exists only in a second- or third-hand narration of its effects.

<p>
The presence of "pale Ramon" is necessary because he provides an audience who can corroborate the narrator's version of events and who can confirm that the borderlands may provide a transcultural aesthetic space unaffected by destabilizing racial associations. The two onlookers share the knowledge that the woman sings out of necessity. "As we beheld her striding there alone, / Knew that there never was world for her / Except the one she sang and, singing, made." Her example is the allegory through which Stevens conveys his message that aesthetic composition begins with an estrangement from the world. But the poem's mediation refocuses the reader's attention not on the singer or her song but on its reception and its effects, namely the secure homosocial alliance that redefines the nature of American community. During their reverie, Ramon and the narrator presumably share and communicate an empowering knowledge that art can facilitate the recomposition of the social order, and their commiseration concretizes the "reality" of this new order for the reader.

<p>
The mediated presentation of "The Idea of Order at Key West," however, contradicts its utopic message and exacerbates the social hierarchies upon which the poem rests. The poem itself is eerily prescient of one of the <i>Adagia</i>: "A poet looks at the world somewhat as a man looks at a woman." The lyric's series of mediations (a text that imagines a small community of men who imagine looking at a woman, who herself is capable of assuming her own powerfully imaginative stance in relation to the world) prevents any facile comparison of erotic or even of gender dynamics; however, the poem and the adage do share a reliance upon general asymmetries in intersubjective 
<b></b>
structures of experience. If the songstress's power is truly effective, the aesthetic space she creates should support a new homosocial community among equals. The narrator implores his companion to corroborate his story and to explain how material objects continue the work of the song. After the song ended, why did they believe "the glassy lights" of banal fishing vessels "Mastered the night and portioned out the sea, / Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles"? How did the solitary woman's song enchant the actual American borderlands and allow it to redefine its own limits and to transform signs of an incendiary eroticism into markers of civility? How might they continue to benefit from "the maker's rage to order," a power of language that enables the reimagination "of ourselves and of our origins"? Stevens's speaker pleads, "Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know." But Ramon remains silent.

<p>
This unbroken silence attests to Stevens's ambivalence about the borderlands, an ambivalence rooted in a nation's uncertainty about whether a Hispanic culture might be invited into North America's national community without further disrupting the sense of the nation's identity and historical force. Dialogue might indicate cultural differences. In a text that compares the borderlands to a theatrical stage, one cannot help but wonder, how would Ramon sound? Would he speak with dangerously "dusky words," as in "Two res"? Or, would he truly be able to elaborate cultural commonalities that cross divides of difference through the fantasy of "ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds"? Although this community consists only of two people (three, at the most, if we distinguish between Stevens and the narrator), it constitutes a microcosmic institution, an <i>idea of order</i>, articulated through the intimate discourse of two males who share some common ground. But Ramon's silence speaks volumes, indicating an uncertainty on the part of the poetic arranger, Stevens, as to whether the two diverse res can ever belong to the same community.

<p>
Through the period including <i>Ideas of Order,</i> Stevens introduces Cuban and Hispanic subjects to demonstrate that a national literature he believed to be defined in part by racial tensions could expand and cross cultural lines without referencing a racial distress that would disturb the poet's "virile," or historical, force. Capitalizing on the historical and discursive structures that blurred the borders between Cuba and the United States, he creates a borderlands space in order to find some community in his Americas which might help him successfully affect social identities. Certainly he tries time and again, in a number of different ways, to make the Hispanic an effective apparatus, even an effective companion, in these endeavors. But Stevens's poetry evinces an uncertainty as to whether the racial, cultural, and even topographical likenesses between North Americans and Cubans were sufficient to forge a new sense of American poetic masculinity. Even "The Idea of Order at Key West," which comes closest to containing racial difference, cannot shake its dependence on a forcibly expansionist production of the borderlands. In 1926, in the shadow of the land boom and almost ten years before he wrote "The Idea of Order at Key West," Stevens was already bemoaning Florida's loss of innocence. Then he felt that the "colonial period of five or ten years ago" was threatened, and he hoped that it might "re-emerge" so it would "be possible to be at one's ease again" (<i>LWS,</i> 247). A similar colonialist nostalgia inflects 
<b></b>
Stevens's later desire to give Ramon personality and voice. Hispanic masculinity still remains racially other (Ramon, after all, is only "pale," not "white"), and Cuba's political and economic infrastructures remain under the sway of U.S. cultural imperialism. Consequently, the very differences that Stevens may have found useful stand in the way of his ability to reimagine a new national community grounded upon an equitable and dialogic relationship between men across a cultural divide. Stevens's desire is structured and problematized by the ambivalences of the historical moment, and so he silences the Hispanic voice before it can interrupt his narrator's reverie with the "dusky words" for which he longed but was afraid to hear.

In <i>Genders, Races, and Religious Cultures in Modern American Poetry, 1908-1934</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001), Rachel Blau DuPlessis notes that "Stevens created his own Negro Renaissance&#8212;a pretend world peopled by colored res enacting muse-like dramas" . DuPlessis reads the general primitivism of these dramas as the poet's nullifying response to the New Negro movement's promise of social redemption; he composes "a new nation" that reverses the Great Migration and returns black Americans to the rural South from the urban North . For her complete reading, see pages 118-23. For an extended treatment, see DuPlessis, "'Darken Your Speech': Racialized Cultural Work of Modernist Poets," in <i>Reading Race in American Poetry: "An Area of Act,"</i> ed.

For a similar discussion of the conservatism underlying Stevens's "destructive character," see Andrew Lakritz's <i>Modernism and the Other in Stevens, Frost, and Moore</i> (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1996). Lakritz argues that Stevens illustrates how the "allotrope" (the writing of the other) produces "rhetorical strategies of dislocation and displacement&#8212;so that the normative stories we tell about our culture might be disrupted and liquidated" . His attempts to generate a new social order still rely upon a language that is embedded in the stereotypical myths of the "old" world. Any revolutionary or creative aim, then, depends upon some conservative rhetorical stance.

Historian Gail Bederman explains that discourses constructing white masculinity in the early-twentieth century revolved around the murderously violent control that white males exhibited over black men who were thought to be "uncivilized, unmanly rapists, unable to control their sexual desires." <i>Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880-1997</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995), 46. I am prone to read any signs of erotic anxiety in Stevens's poetry as an <i>effect rather than a cause</i> for the text at hand; his primary anxiety concerns a racialized struggle over defining "American" poetic virility. When eroticism erupts, it is an index, not an explanation, for a loss of control and a destabilization of presumedly secure power asymmetries.

On the surface, Stevens's troping of racial and ethnic differences seems culturally imperialist. According to Edward Said, "the formation of cultural identities [ought to be] understood not as essentializations (although part of their enduring appeal is that they seem and are considered to be essentializations) but as contrapuntal ensembles, for it is the case that no identity can ever exist by itself and without some array of opposites, negatives, oppositions: Greeks always require barbarians, and Europeans Africans, Orientals, etc." <i>Culture and Imperialism</i> (New York: Vintage, 1993), 52. Upon closer examination, though, Stevens problematizes Said's concept of the "contrapuntal" because he depicts a fraternity and a continuum of racial likeness between North American and Latin American res.

<p>

Explicit Hispanic elements can be found in "The Comedian as the Letter C" (and its earlier version, "From the Journal of Crispin"), "O Florida, Venereal Soil," "The Cuban Doctor," "The Idea of Order at Key West," "Academic Discourse at Havana," "The Woman Who Blamed Life on a Spaniard," "Arrival at the Waldorf," "Mrs. Alfred Uruguay," "The Search for Sound Free from Motion," "The Pure Good of Theory," "A Word with Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez-Feo," "Description without Place," "Attempt to Discover Life," "The Pastor Caballero," "The Novel," and the one-act play "Carlos among the Candles." Less obvious examples include "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction," "Infernale," "Architecture," "The Load of Sugar Cane," "A Duck for Dinner" (<i>Owl's Clover</i>), and the Florida poems.

<p>
<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
I read Stevens's treatment of the Hispanic after <i>Ideas of Order</i> as distinct from his earlier work. During his correspondence with the Cuban editor Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez Feo (1944-55), Stevens sees Cuba as no longer populated only by res who corroborate his "supreme fiction" of masculinity but by an <i>audience of other artists.</i> He subscribed to the vanguardist magazine <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> through Rodr&iacute;guez Feo, and the Cuban editor published several translations of his poetry. How <i>lo cubano</i> interfaced with sexual and gender identities in this later exchange is problematized by Rodr&iacute;guez Feo's homosexuality, which Stevens may or may not have intuited. The North American's poetic did provide a model for Jos&eacute; Lezama Lima and other members of the <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> vanguard who sought to "virilize" gay Cuban masculinity. For a full discussion of Stevens's middle period, Cuba, and masculine sexual identities, see Eric Keenaghan, "Wallace Stevens's Influence on the Construction of Gay Masculinity by the Cuban <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> Group," <i>The Wallace Stevens Journal</i> 24, no. 2 : 187-207.

As late as 1945, Stevens would treat Cuba as a foreign space related to but not wholly part of the United States. When commenting on <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> in 1945, he wrote Rodr&iacute;guez Feo that "<i>for the reader of the exterior,</i> what is of particular interest [in the journal] is the Cubans themselves." <i>Secretaries of the Moon: The Letters of Wallace Stevens and Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez-Feo,</i> ed. Beverly Coyle and Alan Filreis (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1986), 35; emphasis added. When he exteriorizes Cuba, he tends to dehistoricize its culture. For instance, he notes that "Mariano [Rodr&iacute;guez]'s happy little drawings" in <i>Or&iacute;genes</i> "touch" him. "Nothing quite so <i>unconcerned</i> has come my way for a long time. Man's fever is not present here" . His patronizing attitude dissociates the island from the global crisis ("fever") of World War I. Artistically, culturally, and politically, his idea of Cuba is a safe space to which one may turn to escape the present. This quasi-primitivist imperialism is tempered with a desire to see Rodr&iacute;guez Feo and the <i>or&iacute;genistas</i> abandon cosmopolitanism and develop an art that visibly marks their cultural differences from Euro-American modernisms.

Stevens never learned Spanish. In 1945 he wrote Rodr&iacute;guez Feo that he "wish[ed] with all the excitement of a real wish that [he] knew Spanish much better" so that he might be able to appropriate a certain "freshness" from Latin American cultures. "One grows tired of the familiar res and to be able to find a fresh mind in a Mexican critic [like Alfonso Reyes, whom Rodr&iacute;guez Feo had mentioned in a previous letter], or in the many writers in South America, and elsewhere in the Spanish-speaking countries, for which one would feel an instinctive respect would be a real excitement. It is, however, much too late for me to attempt to become really familiar with another language." <i>Secretaries of the Moon,</i> 40. His lack of knowledge, however, does not stop him from ordering Reyes's books, acquiring them as he had many foreign objets d'art. "True, I shall not be able to read them, but I shall get something out of them" . Despite his intentions, Stevens does not wholly escape the asymmetries of imperialism, since he culls Spanish-language texts for raw material that he can use to produce a "fresh" polyglot text in a hispanicized American English.

A sense of how Stevens associated Southern social decline with racial strife is clear in a 1930 letter he wrote to James A. Powers upon returning to Connecticut from Jackson, Mississippi. "I thought the town delightful&#8212;<i>so surprisingly neat and so unexpectedly full of vigor.</i> What a pity that <i>those people</i> don't have the knack of putting themselves across and of throwing the light of the truth on themselves! <i>A few demagogues ruin the reputation of an entire race</i>" (<i>LWS,</i> 259; emphasis added). His surprise at the "vigor" discovered in Jackson attests to his inescapable precepts about black subjects and what he felt to be their contribution to (or responsibility for) the decline of Southern culture. Stevens excises African American populations from most of his Florida poems in order to ensure a sense of stability for his own imaginatively ordered worlds.

In <i>The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language and Twentieth-Century Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), Michael North argues that such "dusky words" and "dusky images" in white American modernisms "advance racial and linguistic diversity as a wedge in [modernists'] campaign against English and New Englandish domination" by contesting those movements that sought to standardize American English . But these writers resort to "the racial alien" who functions as "a cipher" ("natural, primitive, life-affirming, and impatient of restraint") in order to disrupt culturally homogenous representations . For North, the discomforting paradox of "reproduc[ing]" "racial hatred" through the cipher is an <i>effect</i> of a poetic that attempts "racial cross-identification" . I believe, however, that we should credit Stevens and other modernists with some consciousness of the problems of the cipher and the re's reduction of the subject to ideological and stereotypical narratives that make him or her an "it" that is readily <i>legible,</i> totally comprehended upon sight. The poetic deployment of such ciphers would not be <i>useful</i> if modernists were not somewhat conscious of their implicit contradictions.

Ram&oacute;n Fernandez was an actual historical personality, a Mexican-born critic who contributed to the <i>Nouvelle revue fran&ccedil;aise</i>, the <i>Partisan Review,</i> and the <i>Criterion.</i> James Longenbach suggests that Stevens uses the politically outspoken critic's name to assert his own "interest in the ambiguity of ideas." <i>Wallace Stevens: The Plain Sense of Things</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 161. Despite the fact that "most of Stevens's readers will know that Fernandez was a critic familiar to Stevens" , I am seizing upon the very ambiguity of the <i>idea</i> of the <i>hispanidad</i> of Fernandez's name, his Latin American <i>personality</i> (Fernandez had dual citizenship in both Mexico and France), and his poetic transposition from Europe to Florida. In the borderlands, the actual Fernandez is a cross-cultural, Hispanic trope whose connections to French literature and culture only concretize the transnational continuities and cultural bridges connecting North American and Latino/Caribbean cultures.

I forgo the complexities that would arise if I were to read the poem in light of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's homosocial triangle, put forth in <i>Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985), esp. 21-27. A better example of homosociality can be found in "New England Verses," in which Stevens immediately moves from the direct address of the "Dark cynic" in "The Male Nude" section to the objectified representation of Ballatta in the subsequent section, "The Female Nude" (<i>CP,</i> 104-6).

<p>
What difference does it make to the way we read <i>Ulysses</i> that Leopold Bloom is a Jew, or rather, that he is thought by most of Dublin to be a Jew? In the past decade, research into the question of <i>Ulysses</i> and Jewishness has been largely dominated by two main approaches, one concerned with content, and the other with form. Content-oriented critics such as Neil Davison focus on the <i>representation</i> of Bloom as a "Jew," and tend to ignore the formal and stylistic innovations of <i>Ulysses,</i> treating them as distractions in an essentially "realist" novel.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 The form-oriented critics examine Joycean textuality itself for signs of Jewishness&#8212;say, through analogies to the Talmud (Ira Nadel), or to Levinas's philosophy (Steven Connor)&#8212;in a way that tends to bracket the question of the specific function and representation of Bloom, as well as to promote a disturbingly fetishized notion of Jewishness.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 What I want to propose here is a way to synthesize the premise that thinking about Jewishness in <i>Ulysses</i> means thinking about Bloom, with the insight that this thinking needs at the same time to account for the peculiar formal innovations that give <i>Ulysses</i> its place in literary history. I should also point out that other critics, most notably Bryan Cheyette and Marilyn Reizbaum, have acknowledged and addressed the self-consciousness with which Joyce invokes the notion of "Jewishness," however their accounts lack a consideration of the <i>particular</i> literary techniques and styles that distinguish <i>Ulysses</i>: this essay attempts to remedy this omission in critical discussions of Joyce.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>




<b></b>

<p>
In what follows I propose that the way to achieve this synthesis is by thinking less about the <i>identity</i> of either Bloom or the text and more about structural similarities in the way both Bloom and the work <i>Ulysses</i> are perceived by others. In particular, I want to draw attention to a certain conceptual homology between the anti-Semitic notion of "the Jew" and aspects of <i>Ulysses</i>' form, insofar as both might be seen to represent the abstract realm of social relations under industrial capitalism.

<p>
The account of modern anti-Semitism that I find most productive in this context is that put forward by the social theorist Moishe Postone. In "Anti-Semitism and National Socialism," Postone focuses on romantic anticapitalism's confusion of the appearance of capitalist relations for their "essence." Capitalist social relations <i>appear</i>

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
antinomically, as the opposition of the abstract and concrete. Because . . . both sides of the antinomy are objectified, each appears to be quasi-natural. The abstract dimension appears in the form of abstract, universal, "objective," natural laws; the concrete dimension appears as pure "thingly" nature.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Romantic anticapitalism, however, hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of the antinomy. As Postone asserts, romantic anticapitalism does not understand "That concrete labor itself incorporates and is materially formed by capitalist social relations [the abstract dimension]" ("ANS," 309).

<p>
According to Postone, modern anti-Semitism takes this romantic anticapitalist model a step further and sees the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations (for the romantic anticapitalist, capitalism as such) personified in the Jews. Central to the story Postone tells is the observation that

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the specific characteristics of the power attributed to the Jews by modern anti-Semitism&#8212;abstractness, intangibility, universality, mobility . . . are all characteristics of the [abstract] value dimension of the social forms analyzed by Marx. Moreover, this dimension, like the supposed power of the Jews, does not appear as such, but always in the form of a material carrier, the commodity. ["ANS," 308]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
In other words, "the Jew" as imagined by modern anti-Semitism solves the problem of finding a concrete embodiment, or, more precisely, a <i>personification,</i> for powerful social and economic forces that otherwise lack a material manifestation. The Jew serves to personify processes within finance capital that have no concrete manifestation, that are quite literally <i>unrepresentable.</i> Thus we might infer that the problem that anti-Semitism solves is a problem of representation, and that anti-Semitism must therefore possess an intrinsically aesthetic dimension. An aesthetic dimension, and a specific kind of aesthetic at that: the Jew gives a <i>human</i> shape to the abstract circuits and cycles of finance capital. Yet precisely because of this contradictory representational and representative burden&#8212;concretizing the abstract, giving a "thingly," "organic" form to that which has none&#8212;"the Jew" is also always on the verge of being dehumanized.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>


<p>
Postone's account of the modern anti-Semitic image of "the Jew" resonates strikingly with contemporary Marxist accounts of <i>Ulysses</i>' form in which the text's proliferation
<b></b>
of styles is also explained in terms of the abstraction of modern life. Think of the links Fredric Jameson draws between the internal differentiation of <i>Ulysses</i>&#8212;the "autonomization" of "individual chapters and sub-episodes"&#8212;and the Taylorization of the labor process, or of Terry Eagleton's claim that in <i>Ulysses,</i> "[W]hat is turned disruptively against bourgeois <i>culture</i> is in a sense bourgeois <i>economy</i>: the leveling, equalizing, indifferent operations of the commodity form itself, which respects no unique identity, transgresses all frontiers, melts solidity into air, and profanes the holy."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Both Jameson and Eagleton read <i>Ulysses</i> in terms of quasi-Benjaminian <i>correspondences,</i> an inevitable step in trying to explain how the text&#8212;like "the Jew" for the anti-Semite&#8212;might embody otherwise unrepresentable social processes.

<p>
Eagleton goes even further, emphasizing the interdependence of modernism's exilic "estrangement . . . [from] clapped-out national lineages" with "an expression of the rootless conditions of an international monopoly capitalism, whose abstractly universalist forms are mimed by modernism's own progressively abstract techniques."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Estranged from national lineages, rootless, and abstractly universalist? How many writers have described "the Jew" in just this language? Of course, Eagleton is talking about modernism and <i>capitalism</i>. Yet the rhetorical and conceptual convergence between Eagleton's description of "international monopoly capitalism" and modern anti-Semitic discourse remains striking, and not a little disturbing: although "capitalism" is arguably (part of) the correct name for that which is misrecognized by the anti-Semitic fantasy of "the Jew," one also wonders whether the uncanny substitutability of the one term for the other in those lines betrays precisely the scapegoating, binary structure of thought that is inextricable from much of the violence that so distinguished the twentieth century and seems set to persist in our own. My point here, however, is not to disqualify the Marxist accounts of <i>Ulysses</i> and modernism, but to underline the importance of refusing the temptation to <i>anthropomorphize</i> capitalism: it is precisely because Eagleton succumbs to this temptation&#8212;international, monopoly capitalism as an exilic and rootless nomad&#8212;that his rhetoric begins to assume its uncanny likeness to just the discourse to which it can otherwise serve as antidote.

<p>
Eagleton's missteps aside, his and Jameson's accounts suggest that the form of <i>Ulysses</i> emerges from, reflects, and reproduces within literature the same economic processes to which Postone traces the anxieties and projections of the anti-Semite. But whereas <i>Ulysses</i>' response to an increasingly abstract world is to mime and imitate it, and thereby to strip literature of its anthropocentric "illusions," the anti-Semite's response is to reassert the claims of anthropocentric representation, to insist on an answer to the question "<i>Who</i> is doing this?" and to find the Jew behind the curtain, pulling the strings.

<p>
What I've sketched out allows us to think of <i>Ulysses</i> and modern anti-Semitism as sharing more than an historical determinant, namely, an historically specific representational "problematic": how to represent or explain the apparently unrepresentable, increasingly abstract processes of the modern, and modernizing world? This shared problematic&#8212;one to which Joyce and the anti-Semite of course find very different solutions&#8212;in turn raises the possibility that the various notions of "the Jew" that circulate in <i>Ulysses</i> could be read as having a significant relationship to the form of the text. 
<b></b>
To explore this possibility we need, however, to turn our attention toward the issue of how and why Bloom is constructed as a "Jew," and to put ourselves on the lookout for signs of a self-conscious connection within the text itself between the anti-Semitic notion of the Jew as personified abstraction and the way the text itself exploits linguistic abstractions.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>


<p>
It seems to me that these elements converge in "Cyclops," a chapter of <i>Ulysses</i> in which, as we know, Bloom is violently confronted, and makes a stand&#8212;albeit one he later renounces&#8212;<i>as</i> a Jew, but also a chapter in which we see a peculiar reflection on the shape of <i>Ulysses.</i> "Cyclops" also has a special status in the compositional history of the text; for if, until shortly after the end of World War I, Joyce had been writing <i>Ulysses</i> in what he called the novel's "initial style," a style marked by stream of consciousness, dialogue, and intermittent third-person narration, it was with the writing of "Cyclops" in mid-June of 1919 that he abandoned this style and, as Michael Groden tells us, began to write a "second" <i>Ulysses,</i> one "in which a succession of parody styles . . . began to take over."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 "Cyclops" therefore represents Joyce's "first total break" with his initial style (<i>UP,</i> 125). I shall return to the implications of this break at the end of this essay; for now, let me focus on one of the central narratological features of this chapter: the anomalous narrative voice known to critics as "the Nameless One" that runs through the chapter.

<p>
I am not alone in seeing the Nameless One as something of an anomaly within <i>Ulysses.</i> For years Joyce scholars have rightly tried to give an account of the relationship between the Nameless One's singular voice and his patently dubious political and social views. The standard explanation is, of course, that his one voice, his monologue, reflects his one-eyed, cyclopean view, which, unlike the polyphonic novel in which he appears, intolerantly excludes other perspectives and voices. There are a number of problems with this account of "Cyclops." Suffice it to say here that what distinguishes the Nameless One <i>cannot</i> be that he is monologic&#8212;a "one-eyed" single voice as opposed to the polyphony of <i>Ulysses</i>&#8212;if only because Bloom, Molly, and Stephen are all, in their own ways, also monological.

<p>
Yet the Nameless One's voice can indeed be read as a narrative anomaly within <i>Ulysses</i>; in fact, I want to suggest that this voice be read as an embodiment and representation of everything that the rest of the novel&#8212;in formal terms&#8212;is not. Elsewhere I have argued that the central distinguishing feature of this voice within the novel is its use of <i>direct address</i>; I consequently propose that this voice be read in conjunction with Louis Althusser's theory of ideological interpellation, in which, as is well known, a certain kind of direct address is also crucial.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 In Althusser's theory, however, the addressee is interpellated through a call to recognize him or herself as prima facie guilty, while the addressee of the Nameless One's narration is <i>reassured</i> to the extent that he recognizes himself in the narrator's voice and prejudices. Addressed as guilty in the Nameless One's discourse is not the implied addressee, but a putatively trangressive other&#8212;Leopold Bloom. Most pertinent to what follows, I argue that the Nameless One's attacks on Bloom (which occupy much of his narration) presuppose a literary and linguistic normativity that the narrator himself exemplifies and calls upon the addressee to identify with, a normativity from which Bloom is seen to deviate. <b></b>

<p>
The notion of a "narrative anomaly" is, however, just the first piece of the puzzle. In what follows I explore why Joyce presents that normativizing other as <i>anti-Semitic.</i> Why should the target of the Nameless One's hostile self-differentiation be a Jew rather than, say, a colonizing Englishman? And, of course, the Nameless One is not the only one performing an act of self-differentiation in "Cyclops": if the Nameless One represents the <i>narrative</i> "other" of <i>Ulysses,</i> and the Nameless One's "other" is Jewish, what does that tell us about the relationship between the anti-Semitic Nameless One's perception of Bloom as a Jew and the form of <i>Ulysses</i> itself? These questions are best approached by a closer examination of what the Nameless One has to say about how Jews&#8212;especially Bloom&#8212;speak.

<p>
From the outset of the novel, <i>Ulysses</i> acknowledges just the kind of anti-Semitic personification that Postone diagnoses. In "Telemachus," Haines, Mulligan's visiting chum from Oxford, tries to reach out to Stephen in the language of shared nationalism and anti-Semitism: "Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines' voice said, and I feel as one. I don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Garret Deasy, headmaster of Clongowes school and advocate of zero-sum economics (he warns Stephen against the perils of going into debt), offers a still more striking illustration of how anxieties about the nation-state and economics are intertwined in anti-Semitism:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
England is in the hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's vital strength . . . As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. [<i>U,</i> 33]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
In such passages the Jew clearly serves to tie together (or, as Slavoj Zizek puts it, to "quilt") the anxieties about economic and territorial integrity that finance capital arouses; Deasy's diatribe shows especially clearly the slide from economic to organic-biological thinking that is representative of anti-Semitic personification.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>


<p>
The Nameless One and his companions in Barney Kiernan's have a lot to say and repeat about Bloom, most of it familiar to anyone acquainted with both traditional and modern anti-Semitic notions about the body and behavior of "the Jew." Bloom is rumored to be a menstruating "mixed middling," a notion that combines medieval notions about the bodies of male Jews with the theory of the femininity of the Jewish male proposed by Otto Weininger in his 1903 <i>Sex and Character</i>, a book that was all the rage in fin-de-si&egrave;cle Europe, and whose influence on Joyce is still being explored.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Bloom's refusal to drink or treat others to drinks despite the fact that he is rumored to be carrying vast winnings from his bet on "Throwaway" resonates with stereotypical anti-Semitic notions of Jewish stinginess, secretiveness, and diffidence toward local forms of community. It is worth noting here that in earlier drafts of "Cyclops," the rumor was that Bloom had won big in the Hungarian lottery (<i>UP,</i> 132). What remains consistent throughout the different versions of "Cyclops" is the fantasy of Bloom's hidden, hoarded money. Even the rumor&#8212;"John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the idea for Sinn Fein to Griffith"&#8212;is congruent with notions of "the Jew" as a hidden, 
<b></b>
conspiratorial political power: that Bloom would be seen as both a capitalist-type money bags and an anti-imperialist revolutionary conforms all too well to the fantasy world of modern European anti-Semitism described by Postone, which imagines "the Jew" as the "hidden force" behind such "apparent" opposites as capitalism and socialism (<i>U,</i> 335).

<p>
In these respects Bloom is perceived, or <i>mis</i>perceived, to personify the Jew in a manner congruent with modern European anti-Semitism. But it is Bloom's language, the way he talks and what he talks about, that the Nameless One most obsessively and antagonistically dwells upon. I have indicated that the Nameless One marks his own speech as normal and proper and Bloom's (among others) as deviant and improper. Admittedly, there is something counterintuitive about the claim that the Nameless One, whose monologue is, after all, a morass of malapropisms, should be concerned about "proper speech." In the "Cyclops" chapter, however, Joyce's irony frequently works through an implicit tu quoque; the Nameless One's claims about others often reflect equally upon himself. Furthermore, it is not even clear that the Nameless One's malapropisms provide such implicit criticism. His linguistic missteps seem deliberate and willful rather than, as Emer Nolan suggests, signs of a faulty education.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Complaining of Bloom, the Nameless One says,

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: <i>Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw.</i> Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady. [<i>U,</i> 316]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
You can't declare the truth of something to your "aunt" and to your "antimacassar" in the same breath without showing that you know perfectly well which one, in standard English, is your relative and which one protects your furniture.

<p>
The Nameless One's language bears, rather, a family resemblance to cockney rhyming slang: a product of working- and lower-middle-class culture, playfully resistant to the standardization of national languages that Benedict Anderson has shown was crucial to the formation of nation-states.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 Yet it is still a language with its own codes and conventions, mastery of which means identity and inclusion, incompetence in which means exclusion&#8212;exclusion, most significantly, for the stranger, immigrant, or outsider. This very alliance between shared identity and idiomatic speech might lead us to imagine&#8212;following a Zizek-inspired logic&#8212;that what gets abjected from the social body is too <i>strict</i> a conformity to the official laws and standards of the language, that precisely too strict an adherence to the law is felt as a transgression of the boundaries of what we might call "properly improper" or incorrect behavior and taste.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Especially for those nations that stake their singularity on defiance of (English) rigidity&#8212;alongside Ireland and Scotland, the United States and Australia come immediately to mind&#8212;a good part of national identity might reside in the skilled and proper rupture of English linguistic and other proprieties. Something of this "improper propriety" seems to make itself felt in the Nameless One's objections to Bloom's pedantic and playless diction.



<b></b>
<p>

To see what is at stake in the Nameless One's attacks on Bloom's speech, it might help to see what is not. Most of the deviations from "proper speech" that the Nameless One draws attention to are Bloom's, but the first is attributed to the creditor whose debt the Nameless One is supposed to collect, Moses Herzog:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Jesus I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. <i>He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys</i>? [<i>U,</i> 292]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This rendering of Herzog's speech amounts to an English-language version of what was in the German-speaking world called <i>mauscheln,</i> a derogatory term used to characterize the Jew's manner of speaking German.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 It was thought that because of their prior linguistic "contamination" by Hebrew and Yiddish, Jews were constitutionally incapable of speaking German properly, and mastering either grammar or pronunciation. Similarly, the Nameless One's imitation of Moses Herzog's language directly translates Yiddish into English through the imitation of reflexive verbs ("he eat me my") and the use of plurals where standard (and even nonstandard) English permits only the singular: the "teas," "sugars," and "moneys."

<p>
In her recent account of <i>Ulysses</i>' "poetics of Jewishness," Marilyn Reizbaum asserts the centrality of the concept of <i>mauscheln</i> to the representation of Bloom as a self-hating Jew.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 But as Bloom's memories and "Circe's" burlesque demonstrate, Herzog's <i>mauscheln</i> is the language of <i>Rudolph</i> Virag/Bloom, Leopold's father: the immigrant, unassimilated and unmodern, even anachronistic, for whom English remains a foreign language. <i>Mauscheln</i> is not the language of Leopold Bloom, who patiently explains to his wife the meaning of "metempsychosis" and is amused by the stylistic awkwardness of his secret penpal, Martha. The language of <i>Ulysses</i> may be hybrid and may seem like a kind of translated English, but nothing is added to our understanding of <i>Ulysses</i> by describing it as akin to a language that plays such a marginal role in the text itself and from which Bloom is so clearly distinguished.

<p>
Yet the Nameless One clearly locates something "foreign" in Bloom's language; nothing about Bloom disturbs him more. Some representative examples:

And there is, of course, that moment in the midst of the Nameless One's account of a discussion of "Irish sports" that inspired my title:

</blockquote>


<p>
Leopold Bloom doesn't talk like Moses Herzog; he doesn't <i>mauscheln.</i> Nor does the Nameless One think otherwise; the Nameless One's irritation with how Bloom talks is not a question of Bloom's lack of assimilation or a ghetto-like archaism. Yet the Nameless One's incessant harping about how Bloom speaks and what he says still, I want to argue, has to be seen as of a piece with his anti-Semitism.

<p>
The first thing to note here is that the features ordinarily ascribed by modern European anti-Semitism to the <i>person</i> of "the Jew" are recapitulated here in the qualities of the <i>language</i> ascribed to Bloom: abstract, dilatory, detached from concrete particulars. The tension Postone describes between the visible, concrete, "thingly" appearance of the commodity and that which seems in excess of and parasitic upon it reappears in the Nameless One's remarks about Bloom's verbal and verbose defiance of common sense: Bloom can't let a straw be just a straw, a thing in itself about which there is nothing to say&#8212;there has to be something behind it. Second, when we recall that the Nameless One himself appears to embody a kind of antitype of Joycean narrative protocols, we might well suspect that when Joyce makes discursive style central to the Nameless One's criticism of Bloom, Joyce thereby also introduces a certain self-consciousness about <i>literary</i> language to the tension between the Nameless One and Bloom. Let me elaborate on these claims in turn.

<p>
Certain characteristics of Bloom's speech mark him as a stranger, and it is clear that he either doesn't understand (as Fritz Senn argues) or doesn't want to play by (as Wolfgang Hidesheimer suggests) the rules of the language game that regulate discourse in Barney Kiernan's pub.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Bloom seems to function as a harbinger of modernity, for what he introduces to the conversation is what modernity also brings: the sense of the conventionality and <i>contingency</i> of traditional ties that were once seen to be natural. The Princeton astrophysicist J. Richard Gott III has parsed the Copernican revolution (and thereby, arguably, modernity itself) with the phrase "your location is not special"
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 and when Bloom asks about corporal punishment, "Wouldn't it be the same here. . . . ?" it seems less important to worry about what this says about his political credentials than to recognize that what irritates the others about Bloom's question is that it does not take the uniqueness of the Irish situation as a given, as something that, like a straw picked up from the floor, <i>goes without saying.</i> If we follow Georg Simmel's reflections in his essay "The Stranger" on the effects of Jewish immigration and assimilation in Western Europe, the same unsettling destabilization of location that Gott describes as an effect of the Copernican revolution, what we might call a "modernity effect," is also brought about in the life of organic communities by the appearance of the stranger.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 In sharing his scientific preoccupations in Kiernan's pub, Bloom's discourse therefore yokes together the modernity effects of science and the stranger.



<b></b>

<p>
There is, however, also a kind of distortive violence in the Nameless One's representation of Bloom's speech. Bloom may challenge received wisdom&#8212;as he does, say, on the virtues of strenuous exercise or the British use of corporal punishment&#8212;but contrary to the Nameless One's account, he does not contravene natural laws&#8212;telling you that living is dying or that ducks can be milked&#8212;and there is little evidence throughout most of <i>Ulysses</i> that Bloom is anything like as verbose as the Nameless One makes him out to be. In fact, in the rest of <i>Ulysses</i> Bloom is often rather reticent and awkward, especially in comparison to garrulous types like Simon Dedalus (whose imitation of Larry O'Rourke provides a stark contrast to Bloom's own exchange of banalities with him), eloquent storytellers like Martin Cunningham (who rescues Bloom's bumbled attempt to tell his "awfully good" story about Reuben J. Dodd), and confident, if clich&eacute;d, speechifiers like the Citizen. "Cyclops" represents a rare moment where Bloom aggressively asserts himself verbally: no wonder he boasts about it afterwards.

<p>
In his suggestive essay "Bloom Among the Orators," Fritz Senn claims that the Nameless One objects to Bloom's unadorned accounts of things, "Where everybody is expected to wield tropes divertingly, for the fun of it, Bloom remains, even in his most rhetorical moments, factual (whether he gets the facts right or not), sincere and truthful, devoid of Odyssean trickery."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 According to Senn, Bloom is not interested in imaginative embellishment for the sake of entertainment, which is why the Nameless One interrupts him with his own versions. But this is exactly the opposite of what the Nameless One says he objects to in Bloom: not an obsession with the facts, but an obsession with explanations that undermine one's sense of what the facts are; not sincerity, but manipulation:

<p>

<blockquote>

&#8212;But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere? I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?
<br />
&#8212;Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living. [<i>U,</i> 139]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
The gap between what Bloom says and what the Nameless One re-presents him as saying is symptomatic of the distortions of anti-Semitism, of what we might call the difference between Jewish people and the re of "the Jew." Both the gap itself and the fact that the Nameless One continually cuts Bloom off (in this respect the above example is atypical) point also to the way that anti-Semitism in <i>Ulysses</i>&#8212;and in general&#8212;is deeply bound up with problems of representation.

<p>
These distortions strike me as significant, as indicating the step beyond a mere conflict of discourses toward rendering the difference of others as "abnormal," "unnatural," and, at its all too real limit, "unhuman." Such distortions are, of course, of a piece with the distorting worldview of anti-Semitism, which turns a Jewish person into "the Jew." The Nameless One's most extreme claims about Bloom are false in the most insidious ways, and yet still possess a kind of intuitive plausibility. If we haven't seen Bloom lecture for hours on "phenomena," we have seen that he is preoccupied with popular scientific knowledge, and it is true that certain concepts and objects can trigger from him a stream of unfiltered information related to the concept or object in 
<b></b>
question.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 What the Nameless One describes himself as objecting to conforms not to how Bloom really talks but to how we have seen him <i>think</i>&#8212;how we have seen Joyce write him&#8212;in what Joyce called the "initial style" of the previous chapters. Andr&eacute; Topia's description of "Bloomian discourse" captures the essential features of this style:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The clear designation of the theme . . . plays [in "Lotus Eaters"] the role of a kind of title, a chapter-head which automatically summons, elicits, and reels off the whole series of generic expressions which fit it and belong to its "compartment." Rather than a space of reverie we are dealing with a linguistic, a rhetorical, an encyclopedic space. Rather than playing out the unbroken continuum of a description, the text scatters indices each of which corresponds to a subclass, a subgroup of a dictionary grouping, a vast repertory of clich&eacute;s on the "Far East."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
The third-person, past tense, narrative voice that designates the theme is known conventionally as the "narrative norm."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 The Nameless One's "Look at, Bloom, do you see that straw, that's a straw!" parallels the narrative norm's description of the phenomena that catch Bloom's attention, and to which he responds not with a steady hour's dilation on each, but always with enough associated thoughts for Joyce to fill a paragraph until the next stimulus appears.

<p>
What's at stake here is the specific kind of narration that <i>Ulysses</i> presents; the text itself implicitly asks us to read the Nameless One's critique of Bloom in terms of its own procedures. In other words, the Nameless One appears not just as a narrative anomaly, but as a narrative other, a narrating consciousness that is not only hostile toward how Bloom speaks, but that, by extension, also appears to be staging a hostile account of the first half of <i>Ulysses.</i>

<p>
Here, in other words, we begin to see how the tension between the Nameless One and Bloom is also marked by a certain self-consciousness about antagonisms concerning <i>literary</i> language. This tension only becomes more pronounced as the chapter continues. What replaces the initial style and keeps interrupting the Nameless One's own narration is an even more extreme form of what the Nameless One says he cannot tolerate: the numerous parodic interpolations, in which discourse proliferates in a manner that confounds conventional literary narrative and linguistic common sense alike. As soon as the Nameless One has declared to his antimacassar that Bloom could talk about a straw for an hour his own narration is interrupted by an interpolation:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of <i>Brian O'Ciarnain's</i> in <i>Sraid na Bretaine Bheag,</i> under the auspices of <i>Sluagh na h-Eireann,</i> on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. [<i>U,</i> 316-7]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
No sooner is Bloom accused of excessive dilation than the text immediately proceeds through this "interpolation" itself to expand upon the discussion that the Nameless One has just skimmed over. The various interpolated discourses in "Cyclops" do precisely what the narrator sees Bloom as doing: producing endless (or at any rate excessive) 
<b></b>
streams of discourse upon meaningless bits and pieces plucked, like the straw, apparently at random from the environs and events of Barney Kiernan's pub. The interpolation makes the analogy unmistakable. The text aligns the Nameless One's claims about Bloom's abstract loquacity with the proliferation of pastiches that dominate <i>Ulysses</i>' second half.

<p>
Clearly, the interpolation undermines the opposition that operates within the Nameless One's own discourse, not to mention those that he recounts, and suggests that the romanticized myth of origins is not that different from, and is even a by-product of, the increasingly abstract and standardized modernity from which the nationalist wishes to distinguish himself and his country. The discourse of nationalism and "Gaelic sports" is implicated in the world and logic that the Nameless One identifies with Bloom; thus the very language of the concrete, local, organic, and heroic is shown to be abstract, mobile, and subjectless.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>


<p>
It also seems to me that Joyce is suggesting a connection between the sources and kinds of hostility Bloom encounters and the sources and kinds of hostility his own work initially encountered. The Nameless One's reactions to Bloom can also be read as Joyce's representation of how his own work might appear <i>through the eyes</i> of a re whose narrative voice embodies everything that his own work is not. The structural connections between the Nameless One's account of Bloom's language and the actual structure of <i>Ulysses</i>' language suggest that ostracism of a stranger perceived as a Jew and resistance to modernist innovations in literary presentation emerge from the same anxieties about representation and abstraction, and likely also from the same desire, diagnosed by Postone, to see in appearances a reflection of real relations.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>


<p>
If the Nameless One's criticisms work to identify Bloom's language with the abstract discourse of modernity, the interpolated texts deconstruct this very identification. They do so, firstly, by showing that the Nameless One's own discourse, and that of his drinking buddies, is equally implicated in the abstractions of modernity, although these res themselves fail to recognize it. Secondly, the distortions to which the Nameless One subjects Bloom's language point to how much he <i>displaces</i> onto Bloom: what the Nameless One attributes to Bloom&#8212;like what the anti-Semite attributes to "the Jew"&#8212;are actually the features of what Postone calls the "abstract value dimension of social forms." In the Nameless One's case these features also strikingly resemble a number of the techniques of <i>Ulysses</i> itself. The interpolated text on "ancient Gaelic sports" is representative of the moment in which Joyce himself abandons personification.

<p>
Franco Moretti's account of the difference between the initial and the later style in <i>Ulysses</i> is helpful in this context:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Bloom reactivates discourses formed around him . . . and then [in the second half of the book] Joyce reactivates those reactivated discourses, without any longer passing through Bloom's mind. He reactivates them, in other words, without motivating them any longer. Like Pound with <i>The Waste Land</i> [Moretti refers here to Pound's rigorous editing of Eliot's first draft], <i>Joyce eliminates the bodies and keeps the voices</i>: he erases the original motivation, and allows the new technique to take off freely. [emphasis added]
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
This moment of transition is entwined with the question of anti-Semitism. In "Cyclops" Joyce simultaneously abandons the use of Bloom's body to focalize the discourses and phenomena of modern life, connecting the way that the Nameless One constructs Bloom as linguistically "Jewish" with his novel's own distinctive features, particularly its abstraction, its context-ignoring rationality, and its "improper" verbal excesses; these <i>disembodied</i> discourses deliberately mimic the rhetorical features that the Nameless One attributes to Bloom. <i>Ulysses</i> is not, <i>pace</i> critics like Ira Nadel, a "Jewish" text, but it does draw attention to itself as a text that manifests and exploits the properties that the anti-Semite sees personified in "the Jew."

<p>
None of this is to deny that Bloom does, at least in the early chapters written in the "initial style," seem to embody certain key experiences of modernity in forms conventionally linked for various reasons&#8212;some value-neutral, some insidious&#8212;to the experience of modern European Jewry: his mobility, his rationality, his alienation, his preoccupation with commerce and consumption. But in "Cyclops" this kind of embodiment is called into question. Joyce's critique of anti-Semitic fantasies about "the Jew" can be seen as vital to the way we understand <i>Ulysses</i>' break with the language of the individual, with voice, and with anthropocentric representation. "Cyclops," the site of this break, marks the point at which Joyce emphatically abandons the <i>personification</i> of modern life in favor of an artistic exploration of modernity that <i>imitates</i> its abstraction, intangibility, and excess; modernity is represented linguistically and analogically, rather than through a particular kind of person. In the "Cyclops" chapter&#8212;and beyond it&#8212;Joyce displays the creative potential to be found in undoing anti-Semitic fantasies rather than, as so many of his contemporaries did, indulging such fantasies as a means to poetic inspiration. Joyce's recognition of the impossibility of representing all that is abstract, intangible, and excessive in the modern world becomes the point of departure for radical artistic innovations that challenge the constructions of "the Jew" prevailing both in the works of other modernists and in the period's broader discourses of nation and race. <i>Ulysses</i>' most singular formal features can, therefore, be read as a form of critical and complex reflection on early-twentieth-century European anti-Semitism, and thus as an index of the degree of the novel's engagement with one of the definitive elements of the historical period Eric Hobsbawm has called "the Age of Catastrophe."

The particular parody that I have focused on is full of similar reflexive ironies. The Gaelic <i>Sraid na Bretaine Bheag</i> translates into "Little Britain Street." The critic W. J. McCormack has suggested that the Citizen's speeches rely on English clich&eacute;s, while Bloom's account of the postmortem erection, "It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the . . . " exploits a feature of Gaelic known as <i>na cura cainte</i> (runs [or throws] of speech) which are "lengthy phrases which have an established and recognized existence <i>as units</i>" and which are integral to the fluent speaking of Irish. See W. J. McCormack, "James Joyce, Clich&eacute;, and the Irish language," in <i>James Joyce:</i> T<i>he Augmented Ninth,</i> ed. Bernard Benstock (Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1988), 330, 327. On the other hand, Emer Nolan insists that the interpolations, in their very verbal excess, are actually better renderings of Gaelic style than the translations upon which they are based. Yet even Nolan identifies the interpolations as manifestations of "the endlessly levelling discourse of the modern," and fails to show convincingly that the interpolations undermine Gaelic myth any less than they "subvert the language of the modern from the inside." See <i>James Joyce and Nationalism,</i> 107. Bloom too is on occasion the object of these interpolated parodies. Yet what matters is not how Bloom actually talks and whether the parodies are like that too, but that the parodies are like the kind of language that the Nameless One projects onto him. Even when the interpolations parody Bloom's traits, the text is still doing what the Nameless One says that Bloom does.

Was this an anticipatory representation of possible criticism? Although <i>Ulysses</i> as a finished text appeared on Joyce's birthday in 1922, chapters in progress had appeared in the <i>Little Review</i> as early as June 1918. David Trotter sees this date, which marks the publication of the first version of "Calypso" and thus also the point at which it became clear that <i>Ulysses</i> would be radically different from <i>Dubliners</i> and <i>Portrait,</i> as the birthdate of literary modernism. "The Modernist Novel," in <i>The Cambridge Companion to Modernism</i>, ed. Michael Levenson (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 83. Serial publication also gave Joyce four years to hear what people made of the initial style and, in his responding to them, to initiate a second break from literary convention without leaving time for people to get used to the first one. His role in subsequent interpretive endeavors, most notably Stuart Gilbert's book, is well-known. Similarly, while <i>Finnegans Wake</i> was still <i>Work in Progress,</i> Joyce saw fit to "commission" his followers to publish <i>Our Exagmination Round his Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress,</i> which includes "A Litter" to "Germ's Choice" signed by "Vladimir Dixon," but thought to be by Joyce himself. As these examples demonstrate, Joyce was no stranger to the principle of the post-publication, preemptive strike. Freedman's exploration of the ambivalent identification of Anglo-American writers (including Henry James and T. S. Eliot) with the Jew as "an odd double for the artist or the intellectual" has a certain similarity to my argument, but again Freedman's emphasis is on the social status of the writer, rather than on the formal properties of the text.

<p>
The foremost example of a contemporary American avant-garde
poetry&#8212;at least as far as American academics seem to be
concerned&#8212;is the body of writing that, since the brief run of
the journal <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
has come to be identified with that name. Aside from its prominence as
an object of academic attention&#8212;or perhaps in part because of
it&#8212;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writing has been particularly marked by its
practitioners' efforts to construct a genealogy for their aesthetic
principles. This effort has meant dislodging from their comparatively
marginalized positions in literary history a number of key modernist
res&#8212;Louis Zukofsky, Laura (Riding) Jackson, George Oppen,
and Mina Loy, to name a few&#8212;and redefining those res as
postmodernists <i>avant la lettre</i>. The re who looms largest by far
in this reordering of the pantheon is Gertrude Stein. And the particular
spirit of innovation she has come to represent in this postmodernist
poetic tradition is likewise attributable in part to the cross-pollination
among poets and academics associated with L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writing:
a commitment to linguistic indeterminacy as an aesthetic value and
principle of composition.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
Take, for example, the lines "So great so great Emily. / Sew grate sew
grate Emily" or "A go to green and a letter spoke a go to green or praise
or / Worships worships worships" from Stein's 1913 poem "Sacred Emily,"
where her famous line "Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" first appears.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 In lines like these meaning becomes indeterminate, the postmodernist
 argument runs, because we can't make out whether a word like "go"
 is being used as a noun or an infinitive or an imperative verb, or
 because we

<b></b>

are confronted with the fact that the same sounds, like the instances
of "so grat," can refer to different words with completely
different meanings. For readers in search of Stein's postmodernism,
ambiguities like these appear to be underscored by Stein's own remarks
about the literary aims of her ruptured syntax, interchanged parts
of speech, and homophonic puns. When, for instance, in her lecture
"Poetry and Grammar"  she extols the virtues of verbs, pronouns,
and articles, she simultaneously repudiates nouns, insisting that
the former are "varied and lively," able to "make mistakes" and "be
mistaken," while the latter, being merely "the name of anything" do
"not go on doing anything . . . and so why write in nouns."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Not surprisingly, Stein's criteria for hierarchizing the parts
 of speech&#8212;the degree to which those elements can yield
 variations and "mistakes"&#8212;have appeared to readers familiar
 with poststructuralist theory to constitute irrefutable evidence of
 her prescient commitment to linguistic indeterminacy in particular
 and the values of postmodernism in general.

<p>
The proper name, with its long philosophical standing as the one category
of sign that, as Stein puts it, "never can make mistakes can never be
mistaken" has been understood as the sign whose structure of meaning is
the very paradigm of determinacy ("PG," 315). In deconstructive accounts
of language (most prominently in the work of Jacques Derrida) however,
proper names become the very paradigm of indeterminacy. Indeed, according
to the Derridean theory of language that underwrites the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
movement's aesthetic, not only is the name intrinsically indeterminate,
but insofar as it is imagined to represent the underlying structure of
all meaning, it is also what defines the indeterminacy of the entire
linguistic system. Stein's own account of names, which is most thoroughly
elaborated in "Poetry and Grammar" and in her counterfactual history
<i>Four in America</i> , does correspond to the Derridean one to the
extent that the name becomes a paradigm for what all words do. Stein's
theory, however, holds the name to be rigidly determinate. Moreover,
far from renouncing the name's traditional poetics of determinacy in
favor of a more modern (or postmodern, as L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E affiliates
would have it) poetics of indeterminacy, Stein's modernism is absolutely
devoted to the name and the determinacy it entails.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
For Stein, writing poetry at all necessitates recognizing its essential
features, which for her means recognizing that poetry is "a vocabulary
entirely based on the noun" ("PG," 327). And insofar as "a noun is a name
of anything by definition," poetry's most essential feature proves to
be its naming function (ibid.). Modernizing poetry, in turn, becomes a
matter not of rejecting this naming function, but of exaggerating it and
abstracting it into a formal principle of composition: "Was there not a
way," Stein asks, "of naming things that would not invent names, but mean
names without naming them" ("PG," 330). Contrary to the deepest desires
of her postmodern audience, however, what is required for Stein's poetry
to "mean names without naming them" is a logical formalism irrevocably
at odds with both the phenomenological commitments of poststructuralist
linguistics and the materialist commitments of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry.

<p>
What if George Washington had been a novelist instead of a general? In
asking hypothetical questions of this kind&#8212;"what if so-and-so
had done things differently" or "what if such-and-such had happened
differently"&#8212;we are usually interested in whether, if certain
causal events had been different, history would still be the same. A
familiar example of this type of hypothetical inquiry&#8212;versions of
which can also be found in almost any science fiction story about time
travel&#8212;are the "Peabody's Improbable History" segments from the
1960s <i>Bullwinkle Show.</i> In these episodes the genius dog Mr. Peabody
and his hyper-enthusiastic sidekick Sherman use their "Wayback Machine"
to travel back in time and encourage important historical res to
fulfill their destinies. The premise of these "improbable histories"
is rigidly deterministic; Mr. Peabody's "Wayback" adventures are always
urgent precisely to the extent that subsequent history will depend
on a re like George Washington completing some causally decisive
act. Were there a "Peabody's Improbable History" about what would happen
if George Washington were a novelist, Peabody and Sherman would no doubt
disabuse Washington of his literary aspirations. The deterministic logic
of their effort would operate under the assumption that were Washington
to have been penning a romance instead of, say, crossing the Delaware
on Christmas night in 1776, he never would have gone on to become "the
father of his country" or the "first president of the United States,"
for America itself would have failed to materialize as a nation.

<p>
When Gertrude Stein addresses this question, however&#8212;that
is, the question of what would happen if George Washington were a
novelist&#8212;she is less interested in whether history would still
be the same than in whether Washington himself would be the same. In
other words, for Stein the hypothetical possibility of Washington's
doing something different&#8212;writing novels instead of crossing the
Delaware&#8212;raises the question of what changes in his identity,
if any, that difference would bring. Both the standard interest in
whether history would be the same and Stein's specific interest in
Washington's identity derive from the idea that actions are highly
determinate. According to the Peabody worldview, American history in
general and George Washington's identity in particular would both be
decided by Washington's military actions, so that his doing anything
differently would change everything completely. Stein, on the other
hand, far from believing that there would be a discrepancy in either
American history or Washington's identity, obliterates the very idea
of a discrepancy by suggesting that it could never exist to begin
with. According to her there could never be a discrepancy for the simple
reason that Washington, whether novelist or general, could never do
different things.

<p>
In Stein's <i>Four in America</i> (composed 1931-34), George Washington
appears as the fourth of her four. Like Washington, the other
three&#8212;Ulysses S. Grant, Wilbur Wright, and Henry James&#8212;are
American cultural icons. Stein makes the same basic argument for each:
that they could not have been different from what they were. Each argument
develops out of a hypothetical question: "If Ulysses S. Grant had been
a religious leader who was to become a saint what would he have done. If
the Wright

<b></b>

brothers had been artists that is painters what would they have done. If
Henry James had been a general what would he have had to do. If George
Washington had been a writer that is a novelist what would he do."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 In the case of Washington, Stein shows how all the things that the
 general and statesman did&#8212;that is, all the things that make
 him the Washington we identify with that name&#8212;also characterize
 Washington the novelist. Being a novelist does not preclude Washington
 from being "the first president of the United States of America" or "the
 father of his country"; rather, these identifying characteristics are
 part of who he is as a novelist: "I can say what I have to say. George
 Washington did not write a play. He wrote at a novel every day. He who
 was the father of his country" (<i>FA,</i> 168). And thus it isn't that
 Washington remains the same despite doing different things; rather,
 he remains the same because as a novelist he does the same things he
 would have done as a general.

<p>
Stein reverses the formula with Henry James, making him a general instead
of a novelist. The result is the same, however, if not more exaggerated,
for James's acts as a general are not only coextensive with his acts as
a novelist but identical to them, such that what he does as a general can
only be described in terms of what kind of writing he does: "Remember that
there are two ways of writing and Henry James being a general has selected
both, any general has selected both otherwise he is not a general and
Henry James is a general and he has selected both" (<i>FA,</i> 138). That
George Washington and Henry James appear to be the same whether they are
novelists or generals implies that they could not have been different from
what they were, and Stein makes this point explicitly in the chapter on
Wilbur Wright, where she asks what would happen if he had been a painter
instead of an aviator: "If Wilbur Wright had been a painter, just like
there are painters American painters would he have been different from
what he was. Not at all" (<i>FA,</i> 86). Thus Stein produces in the
answers to her hypothetical questions a different kind of determinism
than we get in the standard answer to "what would have happened if." On
the model of "Peabody's Improbable History," we locate the determinism
in particular acts, such as building the Kitty Hawk or surprising the
British troops on Christmas, in such a way that the acts bear a causal
charge in relation to history and identity. For Stein, however, those
same acts are not so much determining as themselves determined. In other
words, she pushes the determinism even farther back, so that it's not
a question of what you do determining both history and who you are, but
rather a question of something else altogether determining what you do.

<p>
Indeed, the only way for there to be no discrepancy between a Washington
who writes novels and a Washington who leads armies is if the mere
fact of being Washington determines that you will write novels and
lead armies. But what is the mere fact of being Washington? What is it
about being Washington that determines the actions that Washington will
perform? From the very beginning of <i>Four in America,</i> the answer
is "George Washington," that is, the proper name itself, for as Stein
puts it, names "denote character and career" (<i>FA,</i> 3). In these
terms, it looks as though Stein is stating a rather extreme form of
what would otherwise be a perfectly plausible explanation for the lack
of discrepancy between the two Washingtons: that even in a hypothetical
world where George Washington had chosen a career as a novelist, the name

<b></b>

would still refer to the same man who was a general in the actual
world. But Stein goes on to argue that all people named George, not just
the hypothetical novelist and actual general George Washington, will be
alike in some basic way, suggesting that far beyond denoting character
and career, names determine them: "I have known a quantity of Georges,
a quantity of Georges. Are they alike. Yes I think so. I may even say I
know so. Have they the same character and career. Certainly certainly"
(<i>FA,</i> 5). And just as all Georges will have the same character
and career, so for Stein will all people named Paul and all people named
Helen and all people named Marguerite and so forth, in such a way that
the likeness of all those bearing the same name becomes the sign of
their having been wholly determined by that name.

<p>
In Stein's catalogue of name-destinies, Paul is among those that fare
the worst:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I have known a great many Pauls. One of them I have even tried to change
the name, unsuccessfully. I know just what Pauls are like even though
they differ. What are they like. They are alike that insofar as it is
possible, nobody, that is not any woman ever really loves them. Now
just think of that and think how true it is. None of them not one of
them have been really loved by any woman. They have been married and
sometimes not married, and anything can be true of them, but they have
never, dear me never, been ever loved by any woman. That is what no Paul
can say. [<i>FA,</i> 5]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
For all Pauls to be destined not to be loved by any woman, it would
seem that the power Stein has invested in the name would have to go
well beyond the function of mere reference. After all, if the name were
strictly a matter of reference, there would be no reason that a lovelorn
Paul couldn't simply switch to some other name, one better suited to bring
him the love he is missing. But when Stein says that the effort to change
the name of one such Paul failed, she suggests that something about his
having been named Paul makes him intrinsically a Paul-type person even
if people no longer refer to him that way. Of course in this light,
the idea that names determine character and career, becomes entirely
implausible, not merely because it would take but one Paul being loved
by a woman to disable the whole claim, but because it is unreasonable
to imagine that a name could ever possess such power.

<p>
However, it turns out that while Stein is positively committed to
a determinism of names, she is not committed to the impossibility
of changing one's name. Indeed, her argument for name determinism is
articulated most explicitly in a chapter of <i>Four in America</i> that
is all about someone who successfully changes his name and, in doing so,
also manages to change his character and career: Ulysses S. Grant. Given
the hypothetical question that frames Stein's discussion of him&#8212;"if
Ulysses S. Grant had been a religious leader who was to become a saint
what would he have done"&#8212;we might assume that his story must follow
the same rule that appears to govern the others, and that Grant the
religious leader will turn out to be identical to Grant the general. But
instead, Grant the religious leader proves to be a completely different
man from Grant the general, and this discrepancy results from Grant's
decision to change his name from Hiram Ulysses to Ulysses Simpson. The
focus of the Grant chapter thus differs from the others in <i>Four in
America</i> insofar as Stein's interest is less in whether Grant

<b></b>

would be the same man if he were a religious leader instead of a general,
than in whether he would be the same if he had kept the same name. In
one respect, the answer is no, to the extent that Stein's reasoning will
never allow Grant to become the general we identify with that name if
he remains Hiram Ulysses. Hiram Ulysses, she argues, is destined to be
a religious leader: "If he had remained Hiram Ulysses Grant would it,
in the meantime, have had something to do with what he would do if he
were a religious leader or saint. I mean by this, if he had been Hiram
Ulysses Grant would he have been a religious leader or saint, would he
have had to be. I cannot doubt it" (<i>FA,</i> 3). Since Hiram Ulysses
will have had to be a religious leader or saint, by extension, then,
it appears that once Grant has changed his name to Ulysses Simpson,
he will have had to become a general.

<p>
If it is the name that denotes character and career, then two different
names will denote two completely different characters and careers, which
for Stein means that Grant's name change yields two completely different
Grants: "You begin to see just by their name that Hiram Ulysses Grant
and Ulysses Simpson Grant are not the same. This is the power of a name
and a name is in war and a name is in religion. It is not the same
name, and the name is not the same" (<i>FA,</i> 18). But this very
discrepancy&#8212;the difference between religious leader Grant and
general Grant, which looks on the surface exactly like the discrepancy
that the chapters on Washington, James, and Wright seek to erase&#8212;is
also what ensures that both Hiram Ulysses and Ulysses Simpson, like
Washington, James, and Wright, could not have been different from what
they were. In this respect the answer to the question of whether Grant
would be the same if he had kept the same name is yes: Hiram Ulysses Grant
could not have been different from the religious leader he was destined
to be, and likewise Ulysses Simpson could not have been different from
the general he was to be. The discrepancy that does emerge, therefore,
is not an effect of there being one man with two different names, but
rather of there being two different names, and hence, two different men.

<p>
If all Georges and all Pauls look roughly alike in their character
and career, then Stein would seem to be making the argument by analogy
that all Ulysses will look roughly like generals, and all Hirams, like
religious leaders or saints. Or to reformulate this using Stein's terms,
the name Ulysses denotes being a general, and the name Hiram denotes
being a religious leader or saint. But if Stein's account of Grant
adheres to the same logic that governs her accounts of Washington,
James, and Wright&#8212;and I am arguing that it does&#8212;that logic
would necessitate the possibility of both a Hiram who was a general and a
Ulysses who was a saint. That is because Stein's understanding of career
is abstract&#8212;closer to the sense of a trajectory or directional
movement, like the career of a planet, than the particular sense of a
vocation, like the military or the ministry. Two different careers in
the vocational sense&#8212;general and religious leader&#8212;can thus
be the same career in the abstract. For Stein, therefore, even if Hiram
Ulysses were to be a general, he would still be the same person and
do the same things he would do if he were a religious leader or saint,
and likewise with Ulysses Simpson. The point is that by virtue of their
different names, Hiram and Ulysses would be two different generals and
two different religious leaders or saints.

<b></b>

<p>
By this logic, however, when Stein says that Hiram Ulysses Grant "would
have had to be" a religious leader, the statement can only make sense
if we understand the determinism it invokes to be dictated by something
other than causality. To return to Washington, it can't be the case
that George Washington must become a general because of his name, or,
for that matter, that he must become a novelist, if only because by
virtue of his name, Washington possesses the same character and career
no matter which vocation he chooses. Similarly with Grant, the name Hiram
can't exactly cause him to be a religious leader in any predictive sense,
and neither can the name Ulysses cause him to be a general, but the name
can mean that Hiram possesses a Hiram-type character and career whether
he is a religious leader or general, and that Ulysses likewise possesses
a Ulysses-type character and career. The name, in short, doesn't cause
a given character and career; having that character and career are,
for Stein, what it means to bear that name.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
A Greek by Any Other Name
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
To read Stein's claim that names denote character and career as
an expression of causality, then, is to miss the force of the term
"denote." To denote, after all, is not to <i>cause</i> but to <i>mean</i>,
and to mean in a certain way. In this respect, once naming becomes
a matter of signification rather than causation, what I have been
calling Stein's name determinism must be understood more properly as
name determinacy. But what exactly is it that names do when they mean
in the determinate way Stein proposes? My commitment to answering
this question arises in part because Stein's idea of what names do,
along with the highly specific kind of determinacy that it involves,
is key to understanding her poetics. Equally important, however, is the
bearing Stein's theory of names has on arguments that seek to align her
work with a postmodern "poetics of indeterminacy." As I suggested in the
opening section, Stein's theory of names and the poetics it entails are
antithetical to the very possibility of linguistic indeterminacy.

<p>
Nevertheless it is easy to see, just taking the example of Grant from
<i>Four in America,</i> how at least one form of indeterminacy can emerge
with respect to proper names. Stein begins the chapter on Grant with the
claim that "names have a way of being attached to those that bear them"
(<i>FA,</i> 3). On the one hand, this claim encapsulates one version of
the determinacy Stein asserts throughout the book; certainly in the case
of Paul, who couldn't change his name, the name is about as attached to
its bearer as it can get. Moreover, in being so attached, the name also
invests Paul with all the character and career that it denotes, and the
case is essentially the same with Washington, James, and Wright, each of
whom, by virtue of his respective name, winds up with the same character
and career even when his career differs from the one we ordinarily
associate with the name. Grant's name, on the other hand, seems to be
marked precisely by its ability to be detached from its bearer. Unlike
Paul, Hiram Ulysses can change his name. It appears that as long as Hiram
can change his name, he can, in effect, have any character and career,
which suggests not only that Hiram can be anyone, but that anyone can
be anyone, a sure sign of indeterminacy if ever there was one.

<b></b>

But in Stein's account, anyone cannot be anyone, for the simple reason
that a particular name, far from denoting any character and career,
can only denote the character and career of its bearer. Thus Grant's
name change does not in the end detach the name from its bearer; rather
it introduces a new name attached to entirely different bearer. Stein's
claim, then, stands firm: names truly do have a way of being attached
to those that bear them. But what is the nature of this attachment? What
exactly is it that names do?

<p>
There's an old academic joke that the <i>Odyssey</i> wasn't
written by Homer, but by another Greek of the same name. Part of
the joke, of course, is that it doesn't really matter who wrote the
<i>Odyssey</i>&#8212;meaning who Homer was&#8212;because we understand
the poem in principle to have been written by the man we know by that
name. Thus, while we might discover that the name Homer refers to some
other man than we had thought, the discovery would make no difference to
our understanding that Homer wrote the poem in question. In this respect,
Homer&#8212;like all four of Stein's <i>Four in America</i>&#8212;cannot
be different from what he was. The difference is that in Stein's book,
being called "George Washington" will be sufficient to identify the
bearer of the name as the father of his country even if he is a novelist
instead of a general, whereas the joke implies that other things besides
bearing the name "Homer" are required for someone to count as the author
of the <i>Odyssey,</i> requirements that apparently include being Greek
and having written the <i>Odyssey.</i> In this case, the tautology is
what provides the humor of the joke, such as it is. The humor revolves
around identifying the reference for the name "Homer," and one of the
criteria for identifying the reference is that in order to have written
the <i>Odyssey</i> you need to have written the <i>Odyssey.</i> But the
intrinsic claim of the joke&#8212;that to qualify as the bearer of the
name Homer you need to satisfy a set of descriptive criteria&#8212;is
not tautological, and it entails an important way of thinking about what
names do, albeit the wrong one from Stein's perspective.

<p>
That Grant, Wright, James, and Washington, and, for that matter, Homer,
"could not have been different from what they were" by virtue of their
names already suggests one of the customary functions of proper names:
the name is a convenient way of referring to the same person or thing
at different times and in different situations. Indeed, both Stein's
explicit claim that "names have a way of being attached to those that bear
them" and her implicit claim that bearing a particular name <i>means</i>
being a particular kind of person and thus being the same at different
moments, can be understood to assign the proper name precisely this
referential function. Moreover, once we define the name by the identity
of its referent, then Stein's other claim about names, that they
"denote character and career," follows directly, at least inasmuch as
"character and career" constitute the descriptive criteria by which we
ascertain that we are referring to the same object each time we use a
given name. To illustrate this in terms of the Homer joke, aspects of
Homer's character and career&#8212;"being Greek" and "having written
the <i>Odyssey</i>"&#8212;function as the identity criteria by which we
determine whether or not a particular person qualifies as the bearer or
referent of the name Homer.

<p>
Stein herself seems to endow character and career with a similar capacity
vis-&agrave;-vis Grant when she explains why Hiram Ulysses could not
have done certain things that make up the biography of Ulysses Simpson:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Hiram Ulysses Grant would never have visited the Duke of Wellington he
would never have had his daughter married to a European. Not he. And
why not he. Because he was a tall thin man and he was drunk a little
always often and standing and he was leading in religion in American
religion, and he was not one any Duke of Wellington would have been
writing to visit him because the Duke of Wellington would not have heard
of him. [<i>FA</i>, 75]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Obviously the point of this passage is that marrying one's daughter off
to a European and visiting the Duke of Wellington are constituents of
a character and career that Hiram Ulysses Grant couldn't have had. And
from this point it would seem easy to surmise that these constituents
of character and career serve the same function in relation to the name
Ulysses Simpson as "being Greek" and "having written the <i>Odyssey</i>"
serve in relation to the name Homer. They are what will identify
someone as the bearer of the name Ulysses Simpson, while another set of
descriptive criteria will identify someone as Hiram Ulysses.

<p>
Thus, in the case of the Homer joke, we could say that the name Homer
<i>means</i> the man who wrote the <i>Odyssey,</i> and that would be one
version of how we might understand the claim that names denote character
and career. But I want to argue that in <i>Four in America,</i> Stein
doesn't think that the name Ulysses S. Grant means the man who visited
the Duke of Wellington, or that George Washington means the man who was
the father of his country <i>in the same way</i> that we could mean by
Homer the man who wrote the <i>Odyssey.</i> There are two important
reasons why, despite many superficial similarities, what Stein says
names do can never correspond to what they do in the Homer joke, can
never satisfy what I call the "identity-criteria" account of names.

<p>
First of all, the Homer joke implies that different names can be used
to refer to the same thing. True, we may identify a man as Homer
only if he fits a particular description&#8212;the Greek who wrote
the <i>Odyssey</i>&#8212;but since what identifies the man is that
description and not, ultimately, the name itself, the very logic of
identity criteria dictates that the same characteristics may attach to a
different name. This possibility arises in the setup to the Homer joke,
where the proposition that the <i>Odyssey</i> wasn't written by Homer
immediately raises the expectation that the punch line will involve a
different name. Even if the name were to change, however, the identity
criteria would necessarily designate the same referent. The whole
point of Grant's name change, by contrast, is precisely that the same
referent cannot bear two different names; as I have already explained,
with each new name comes a new and different bearer. Thus, the fact that
the names Hiram Ulysses and Ulysses Simpson correspond to what look like
two different sets of identifying descriptions is <i>necessary</i> in
Stein's account, whereas such a discrepancy would be purely contingent in
the identity-criteria account. The second reason Stein's account cannot
accommodate the idea of identity criteria comes back to the issue of
determinacy. If we play by Stein's rules we won't want to call whoever
married his daughter off to a European and visited the Duke of Wellington
at some particular moment in history "Ulysses S. Grant"; rather, only
someone we call Ulysses S. Grant will have been able do those things.

<p>
For Stein, in other words, character and career, instead of existing in
some more or less direct <i>relation</i> to the name, are <i>entailed</i>
by the inherent formal features of the

<b></b>

name. More accurately, the character and career that a name denotes are a
necessary (i.e., noncontingent) effect produced by this formal function
of reference. To say that Stein thinks of a name as embodying reference
as a formal function, rather than simply as pointing to particular
qualities or objects, might on the surface look like a distinction
without a difference, but the difference becomes clear when we view
Stein's account of names within the standard terms of contemporary
philosophical debates over what names do.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Sense or Reference?
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The central question in those debates is whether or not names carry
a connotative sense above and beyond their specific referent, and
what logical consequences the answer to that question holds for the
truth-values of propositions. The mathematical philosopher Gottlob Frege
makes one of the strongest arguments in favor of names having sense in
his "Sense and Reference" .
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 According to Frege, the only way that identity statements involving two
 names for the same thing can be informative rather than merely trivial
 is if each of the names has a different sense. The famous example of
 this is the identity statement "Phosphorus is Hesperus," where both
 names refer to the same object&#8212;the planet Venus&#8212;but each
 has a slightly different sense, "Phosphorus" meaning "the morning star"
 and "Hesperus," "the evening star." Of course the point of remarking
 on the difference in sense between these two names is to emphasize
 not the difference itself, but rather the fact of there being any
 sense at all. Moreover, for Frege, "sense" is not just a discovery
 about how names work, it is to be understood as <i>integral</i> to how
 they work; if it weren't, a statement like "Phosphorus is Hesperus"
 would be equivalent to the statement "that planet is that planet." In
 other words, if sense were not integral to the name, we could simply
 substitute the referent for the name and suffer no loss of meaning,
 but in the statement "that planet is that planet" the information
 contained in the original identity-claim, "Phosphorus is Hesperus,"
 has evaporated, leaving a mere truism.

<p>
The force of Frege's discussion is to establish sense as essential to the
way names work. But once he has shifted our emphasis from reference to
sense in this way, what then is the function of reference with respect
to names? In the following passage, Frege describes a situation that,
although presented as atypical, suggests the degree to which reference
is understood by him to be a nonessential feature of names:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Combinations of symbols can occur that stand for something but have
(at least so far) no reference, e.g., divergent infinite series. This
can be avoided . . . by means of the special stipulation that divergent
infinite series shall stand for the number 0. A logically perfect
language (<i>Begriffsschrift</i>) should satisfy the conditions, that
every expression grammatically well constructed shall in fact designate
an object, and that no new sign shall be introduced as a proper name
without being secured a reference. [<i>GF,</i> 70]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The problem here, according to Frege, is that certain symbols, that is,
things that "stand for" other things (a species of names if ever there
was one), do so without

<b></b>

having any referent, which suggests that a name can have a sense
which does not determine a referent, a condition in which all sorts of
ambiguities may arise. This happens all the time in ordinary language,
but one doesn't want it to happen in a "logically perfect" language,
and so, according to Frege, to avoid "logical mistakes arising from
the ambiguity of [such] expressions," it is necessary to secure them a
reference by "stipulating" it (<i>GF,</i> 70). The fact that a reference
can be stipulated would seem to suggest that it is a purely contingent
property of names in Frege's account. But as I will show, the stipulation
that Frege proposes for securing the reference of names in a logically
perfect language is merely a practical requirement to avoid ambiguity. A
similar principle of stipulated reference, once formalized, becomes
for Stein the essential function of names. In her work this formalized
referentiality not only makes any ambiguity or indeterminacy of sense
impossible, it also&#8212;and this is in stark contrast to what it does
for Frege&#8212;makes reference integral to the name. Reference becomes
a defining feature of what the name <i>is</i> as opposed to a description
of what it <i>does</i>. It is as if Stein were imagining Frege's idea of
a symbol "standing for" something as a purely referential function, but
one that did not involve any necessary relation to a referent&#8212;as
if one could have reference without referents.

<p>
Thus "names have a way of being attached to those that bear them,"
I am arguing, is simply a way of articulating a state of denotation in
which the concept of the bearer (the referent) becomes a <i>formal</i>
property of the name itself (as the function of reference). And insofar
as I am claiming that this is just another way of saying that reference
(the designation of a bearer) is intrinsic to the name, then Stein's
account of what names do would seem to counter Frege's by suggesting
that names have only reference. Among Stein's contemporaries, Bertrand
Russell is the exemplary proponent of this view in the context of the
philosophical debate over what names do. Pointing to the identifying
properties of "sense" as the essential explanation for why names can
only refer, Russell argues that what Frege calls the "sense" of a name
is basically a description that comes into play only when we fail to use
a name "properly." According to Russell, if I were to say, for example,
that Hiram Ulysses Grant changed his name and became Ulysses Simpson
Grant, and you didn't know who Grant was, I would have to supplement my
use of the name with descriptive criteria to help identify the reference.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 "He was a general who won decisive battles in the Civil War,"
 I might say, or "he became the eighteenth president of the United
 States." What such recourse to description means to Russell is that
 we are really using <i>proper</i> names only when we refer to things
 either that are present before us or with which we have had direct
 experience beforehand; only in the absence of such "acquaintance,"
 to use Russell's term, do we employ descriptions.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
In this respect, a statement about Grant is in fact a bad example,
since Russell argues that with someone like Grant we couldn't have the
kind of acquaintance required to make our use of that word count as
an instance of naming. For Russell, "Grant" would belong instead to a
certain category of names that are not names at all, strictly speaking,
but rather descriptions in disguise:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
You remember when Adam named the beasts, they came before him one by
one, and he became acquainted with them and named them. We are not
acquainted with Socrates, and therefore cannot name him. When we use
the word 'Socrates', we are really using a description. Our thought
may be rendered by some such phrase as, 'The Master of Plato', or 'The
Philosopher who drank the hemlock', or 'The person whom logicians assert
to be mortal', but we certainly do not use the name as a name in the
proper sense of the word.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
From this perspective, the descriptive function of a name like "Socrates"
or "Grant" looks exactly like Frege's evidence for names having
sense. Russell himself seems to support Frege's view when he claims
that the vast majority of what we ordinarily think of as proper names
are "really descriptions" (<i>ML,</i> 156). Indeed, so many names turn
out to be "really descriptions" that finally Russell is left with only
two that count as truly proper names. The demonstrative pronoun "this"
and the personal pronoun "I" are the only terms capable, he suggests, of
"stand[ing] for a particular with which one is acquainted at the moment"
(<i>ML,</i> 162). The key difference between Russell and Frege lies in the
relation between experience and the referential function of the name. For
Frege, experience is eliminated from the reference of the name because,
as in the case of the referentless names of mathematics, there need be
no actual referent. For Russell, meanwhile, there can be no referential
function <i>without</i> an actual referent, i.e., an object of experience.

<p>
Thus, even though Russell's account of names looks strikingly like
Frege's insofar as most names turn out to be "truncated descriptions,"
his decision to limit proper names to only those that refer to things a
speaker has actually experienced makes a profound difference with respect
to the functions available for names in logical language (<i>PL,</i>
110). Whereas for Frege a name can occur in a "perfectly logical language"
as long as it is secured by a reference, for Russell a perfectly logical
language will never contain any names precisely because the proper name,
strictly defined, can only ever refer. Of course, to the extent that
Russell's proper names must of necessity refer to objects of acquaintance,
the Fregean idea of a referentless name that could be provided with a
stipulated reference becomes for Russell a logical impossibility.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Yet, that is the very kind of name that could work in a logical
 language, because it is the kind of name whose reference could be
 general rather than particular: "You can see why it is that in the
 logical language set forth in <i>Principia Mathematica</i> there are
 not any names, because there we are not interested in particular
 particulars, but only in general particulars" (<i>PL,</i> 63). As
 Frege's example of the name for a divergent infinite series suggests,
 stipulating a reference for something that cannot be an object
 of acquaintance makes it possible for the reference to designate a
 principle&#8212;what Russell would call a "general particular"&#8212;as
 opposed to a "particular particular."

<p>
For Russell and Frege alike, a logically perfect language requires an
absolute adherence to principle, its representations never subject to
the vicissitudes of experience. This commitment to pure abstraction is
what leads Frege, on the one hand, to imagine a name that can "stand for"
something without having an actual referent, and Russell, on the other,
to insist that because names can only have actual referents, they can
never be part of a logically perfect language. The whole force of logic
is gathered,

<b></b>

in other words, around the task of eliminating ambiguity and indeterminacy
by way of eliminating experience from the objects of representation. Frege
locates the origin of ambiguity in the sense of names rather than in
their reference, insofar as the point of stipulating reference is to
alleviate the problem of "logical mistakes arising from the ambiguity of
expressions" (reference is designated, while sense is expressed). Russell
also invokes sense&#8212;for which he uses the term "description"&#8212;as
the source of ambiguity: "the description required to express [a] thought
will vary for different people, or for the same person at different
times" (<i>ML,</i> 156). Meanwhile reference becomes for both Russell
and Frege an anchor amidst the transitory currents of sense: "The only
thing constant (so long as the name is rightly used) is the object to
which the name applies" (<i>ML,</i> 156). Of course, according to Russell
the name is most often <i>not</i> "rightly used," so that its reference
becomes indeterminate (who is Socrates? who is Grant?) and requires for
its determination the descriptive identity-criteria that Frege calls
"sense." Consequently, despite his insistence that reference&#8212;as
opposed to sense&#8212;is the defining property of a name, Russell is
finally as committed to the necessity of identity-criteria as Frege.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
As different as these accounts are, both Russell and Frege cling to the
idea that the referent, if not fixed by stipulation or ostension, becomes
indeterminate and requires the set of descriptive identity-criteria to
resolve the indeterminacy. But as long as reference is a function of
identity, no proper name can ever be truly secure in its reference;
we might always misdirect the reference. Moreover, if the proper
name traditionally represents the most determinate relation there can
be between a sign and its referent, and if the name is nevertheless
essentially indeterminate, then all language will come to look as though
it conforms to something like a basic law of indeterminacy.

<p>
That law of indeterminacy is the starting point for the critical
approaches to Stein that view her texts as experiments in a kind of
prescient postmodernism. Deriving their methodological authority from
post-Saussurian linguistics and deconstruction, such approaches
customarily argue for indeterminacy as a means of displacing
various idealized forms of representation, including that of a rigid
correspondence between sign and referent. For Jacques Derrida, the fantasy
that indeterminacy serves to displace is precisely that of the proper
name. The "Roundtable on Translation" in <i>The Ear of the Other</i>
 begins with the proposition that the proper name is a special
case in language because of its untranslatability: "Any signified whose
signifier cannot vary nor let itself be translated into another signifier
without a loss of meaning points to a proper-name effect."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Of course, the correspondence between signifier and signified is not the
 same as the correspondence between sign and referent, for the former
 is productive of sense, while the latter is, obviously, a matter of
 reference. But for Derrida, the one slips easily into the other, and
 this slippage is necessary to produce the linguistic indeterminacy to
 which he is committed. In any case, Derrida imagines the proper name to
 be characterized by an "absolute command" of signifier over signified,
 and in order to construct what that command would look like in its
 purest form, he hypothesizes an idealized, "absolutely secret first
 name which functions all the time without our knowing it" and which
 "has nothing to do with my public proper name or with what anyone may
 know about me" (<i>EO,</i> 106).

<b></b>

<p>
Initially in Derrida's account, the function of this hypothetical secret
name is strictly to address: without any conscious identification on
the part of the speaker, the name, once uttered, simply "calls" to
the bearer. Derrida gives as an example of how such a name would work
a "moment" in the "conclusion of [psycho]analysis" when the analyst
would find him or herself "addressing the patient using his or her most
proper name, possibly the most secret," that is, "when the analyst would
say to the patient 'you' in such a way that there would be no possible
misunderstanding on the subject of this 'you'" (<i>EO,</i> 107). The point
of making the purest proper name secret, of withholding it in principle
from any form of knowledge, is to remove the name from the realm of
experience, and hence, from any of the vicissitudes of experience that
might detach the name from its proper bearer. The problem is that as
soon as the name is uttered, which according to Derrida it must be if
it is to fulfill its function of "calling" to its bearer, it enters a
"system of relations" where "pure address is impossible": "I can never
be sure when someone says to me&#8212;or to you&#8212;says to me 'you,
you,' that it might not just be any old 'you'" (ibid.). The fact that
even the secret name is subject to such uncertainty means for Derrida
that uncertainty is essential to all linguistic signs:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I can never be sure that the secret address might not be diverted, like
any message or letter, so that it does not arrive at its destination. This
is inscribed in the most general structure of the mark. The proper name
is a mark: something like confusion can occur at any time because the
proper name bears confusion within itself. [ibid.]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In making the extreme instance of the proper name secret, Derrida
appears to be doing something akin to what Frege does when he proposes
the stipulation of reference. Like Derrida's effort to imagine a secret
name, Frege's effort to imagine a purely logical reference protects the
name from the ambiguities and indeterminacies of experience. The force of
Derrida's deconstruction of the name, however, is to show that reference
can never be an ontological property of the name (as it is for Stein);
rather, reference becomes an epistemological effect that can only be
produced by an act of linguistic exchange. The name, in other words, does
not <i>first</i> have its reference and <i>then</i> enter circulation;
it has its reference only by way of entering circulation. Consequently
it is subject to all the vicissitudes of experience that make any mark
signify differently in different contexts. In short, this means that any
proper name can become a common noun. And the extent to which the proper
name can, as Derrida says, "drift off course toward a system of relations
where it functions as a common name or mark," is proof for him that all
signs, including proper names, are always already adrift (<i>OE,</i> 108).

<p>
The consequence of seeing all proper names as common nouns <i>in
potentia</i> is that the proper name is never really proper at all. In
this respect, Derrida's argument is essentially Frege's in a much
stronger form. If for Frege the fact that all names have sense as well
as reference means that there is in the final analysis no substantial
difference between a word like Phosphorus and a phrase like "the morning
star," for Derrida the fact that a name and a common noun can be the
same means that there can be no

<b></b>

reference without sense. And for Derrida it is the inseparability of
reference from sense that makes all signs indeterminate. Obviously the
problem of differentiating sense from reference lies at the heart of all
three of the philosophical accounts of names I have been discussing. It
is what drives Russell's effort to distinguish the pronouns "this" and
"I" from all other names; Frege's insistence that a logical language
must stipulate reference; and Derrida's hypothesis of the secret
name. In all three accounts, the attempt to separate reference from sense
deconstructs because the name and its bearer are imagined to be striving
(and inevitably failing) to remain the same as they migrate from context
to context.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
The Grammar of the Rose
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In "Poetry and Grammar" Stein's view of the name looks much like
Derrida's. She seems to be making the argument that the common name,
or noun, is merely a diminished proper name, an attenuation of the
immediacy of reference:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Now actual given names of people are more lively than nouns which are
the name of anything and I suppose this is because after all the name
is only given to that person when they are born, there is at least the
element of choice even the element of change and anybody can be pretty
well able to do what they like, they may be born Walter and become Hub,
in such a way they are not like a noun. A noun has been the name of
something for such a very long time. ["PG," 214]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Stein seems divided on the question of how proper names relate to
their common counterparts. On the one hand, the name appears utterly
distinct from the common noun: it can be changed in ways that the noun
cannot. But on the other hand, it looks as though all nouns begin as
proper names, and only become less "lively" (and thereby more common)
after they have been used "for such a very long time" that they are
no longer possessed of the "element[s] of choice [and] change" they
presumably had when they were first used. The notion of a baptismal
advent of the name&#8212;whether it be a proper name or a common
noun&#8212;is precisely the fantasy that Derrida aims to deconstruct by
showing that no such privileged origin exists for the name, much less
for the common noun. But while Derrida rejects the idea of there being an
initial inception of the name, he is nevertheless committed to the idea
that the name subsists through a history of use, that even though its
meanings change from one context to the next, the name itself remains
the same, gaining ever more distance from a retroactively idealized
(and impossible) reference.

<p>
But for Stein the liveliness proper names have upon being given
at birth or being chosen to replace other names functions not as
a way of fetishizing an originary reference that is subsequently
lost, but rather as a way of negating the very possibility of such a
loss. Redefining reference this way, Stein gains precisely the opposite
of what the originary-reference fetishist is forced to lament. If the
originary-reference fetishist is sad because all proper names wind up
as common nouns, Stein is happy because all

<b></b>

common nouns can be made, through her own poetic invention, to work
like proper names. The gain, in other words, is a means of alleviating
the deadness that accrues to common nouns through use. But even if
one wanted to imagine that Stein had solved this particular problem of
names, a larger question remains: why does Stein care about names in
the first place?

<p>
She gives her answer implicitly throughout "Poetry and Grammar," in which
she emphasizes repeatedly that names are the stuff poems are made of:
"now and always poetry is created by naming names the names of something
the names of somebody the names of anything" ("PG," 234). If we accept
Stein's notion that poetry has traditionally been a means of expressing
one's love of an object, and if what one most often does in expressing
love for a thing is to call out its name, poetry can be understood,
Stein contends, as "a state of knowing and feeling a name" ("PG,"
233). "You can love a name," she explains, "and if you love a name
then saying that name any number of times only makes you love it more,
more violently more persistently more tormentedly. Anybody knows how
anybody calls out the name of anybody one loves. And so that is poetry
really loving the name of anything. . . . Yes any of you can know that"
("PG," 232). But names apparently become a great deal less lovable as
they get used for other than purely baptismal or incantatory purposes,
when they come to have sense as well as reference. In short, names become
less lovable when they become nouns: "Nouns are the name of anything and
anything is named, that is what Adam and Eve did and if you like it is
what anybody does, but do they go on just using the name until perhaps
they do not know what the name is or if they do know what the name is
they do not care about what the name is" ("PG," 229).

<p>
For Stein, loss of interest in what the name is threatens poetry with a
similar loss of interest. This leads her to question the viability of the
noun as the basis of poetry: "Things once named the name does not go on
doing anything to them, and so why write in nouns" ("PG," 210). But given
that what Stein laments is a loss of interest in the name, she clearly
retains a commitment to poetry being all about loving the name. What
remains for her, then, is to imagine a way of keeping names in poetry
without their falling prey to use: "Now that was a thing that I too felt
in me the need of making [anything] be a thing that could be named without
using its name. After all one had known its name anything's name for so
long, and so that name was not new but the thing being alive was always
new" ("PG," 330). We're already familiar with the idea of the thing named
being new from Stein's account of Grant. Grant becomes new each time he
gets a new name, to be sure, but Stein suggests an even deeper and more
perpetual newness that is purely a function of Grant's being alive. That
the name, in contrast to the life, is <i>not</i> new implies that through
each successive use the name remains the same, and in this respect the
problem of revitalizing poetry becomes a matter of revitalizing the name,
of finding a way for the name to be new each time it occurs.

<p>
Stein looks to pronouns in particular for the model of such a renewable
commodity. Pronouns "are of course not really the name of anything. They
represent someone but they are not it or his name. In not being his
or its or her name they already have a greater possibility of being
something than if they were as a noun the name of anything"

<b></b>

("PG," 316). Here it looks as though Stein is eschewing the name
completely, contradicting what I have been arguing thus far. But a closer
look at what pronouns do will show that while they certainly are not
names in the sense that Stein intends when she speaks of names being
used, they nevertheless have everything to do with the kind of naming
that she valorizes in both her account of Grant's name change and her
account of poetry as the love of names.

<p>
If we think about Russell's choice of the pronoun "this" as one of two
truly proper names, we can easily imagine that Stein values in the pronoun
the function that Russell values: its capacity for pointing to an object
that is present. Certainly the function of any pronoun is referential in
this sense, even when its referent is simply another word. But if we thus
construct the referential function as a relation between the pronoun and
its referent, so that the pronoun is what we use when a thing is present
and we want to point at it, it's hard to see how the pronoun could ever
be understood as something in and of itself, as Stein wishes. It is,
at best, a medium for viewing the object. Moreover, if we plug this
deictic function back into Stein's account of what names do in poetry,
we are right back where we started: with an originary production of a name
that grows deader and deader each time we use it, much as a pronoun loses
meaning if we repeat it too many times without restoring its referent.

<p>
But if we think of the pronoun, like the mathematical variable <i>x</i>,
as essentially defined by its referential function, the pronoun no
longer seems to suffer such a diminished fate. After all, if we square
an <i>x</i> in one mathematical expression, and then times it by two in
another, and then gave it a minus sign in another, we would hardly be
inclined to regret that the <i>x</i> had somehow grown less lively or
meaningful over the course of our different uses of it, and we certainly
wouldn't say that its meaning had thereby become indeterminate. The
reason that the <i>x</i> can never suffer a loss of meaning or be
indeterminate is because in any given context, the value of <i>x</i>
will always <i>in principle</i> be a matter of reference. We can see
now why Frege would propose stipulation as a solution to the problem of
ambiguity in expressions, for as soon as reference becomes a matter of
stipulation, any possibility of ambiguity falls away. But Stein goes even
further than Frege: by her logic, the particular reference of a variable
at any given moment is less a matter of stipulation, than a matter of the
variable itself being essentially identical to its referential function.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Reference, in other words, is an intrinsic feature of the variable
 insofar as it constitutes the condition of possibility that allows the
 variable to stand in for any particular referent. In this sense what
 the variable (and likewise the name) denotes is something like its own
 rule of operation, much as we might say that the pieces in a chess game
 denote their own rules of movement. But while we conventionally think
 of the value of <i>x</i> as stipulated at the outset of a mathematical
 operation and then as remaining the same throughout that operation,
 for Stein no matter how often <i>x</i> might appear, each successive
 use would have to be understood as presenting both a new <i>x</i> and a
 new value, even as <i>x</i>'s capacity for reference remained unchanged.

<p>
If we think about the pronoun operating according to the logic of the
variable, and then apply this model of reference to the function of names,
it is easy to see how Stein

<b></b>

would insist that Hiram Grant and Ulysses Grant are two completely
different men. It is less easy, however, to see why George Washington the
novelist would not be different from George Washington the general. In
effect, they <i>are</i> different by the logic of reference, inasmuch as
each occurrence of the name George Washington is a new instantiation of
the reference the name entails. Yet this logic of reference also entails
that Washington can never be different from what he was. There is no
contradiction here: in each separate, successive moment of being named,
Washington can only be Washington. By imagining names to possess the
variability of pronouns, where any name becomes a wholly different term
with each new use, Stein produces an unassailable distinction between
sense and reference, so that even a common noun can retain the purity
of the reference it embodies in any given moment of its use.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Thus, to return to Derrida for a moment: what constitutes from his
 perspective the phenomenological inseparability of sense and reference,
 and the consequent impurity of all reference, becomes from Stein's
 perspective a mere conflation arising from the failure to recognize that
 reference is what names are, not merely what they do. Moreover, only if
 the name is understood to be the same over the course of different uses,
 that is, only if it is understood as an object of continuous experience,
 can it be subject to the indeterminacies that Derrida proposes, and
 only then can the name be understood to revert to a common noun.

<p>
For Stein there is no question of the name reverting over time to
the status of a common noun; the common noun instead acquires the
logical function of the proper name each time it appears. Nowhere is
her commitment to this understanding of the proper name more evident
than in the famous line "Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose." The line
appears to depict something very like the Derridean transformation of the
referential proper name into the descriptive common noun. It begins, after
all, with a name&#8212;the capitalized, article-free "Rose"&#8212;and
predicates a description on it: <i>what</i> is Rose? Rose is <i>a</i>
rose. But when Stein claims that "in that line the rose is red for the
first time in English poetry for a hundred years," she is emphasizing
not the attenuation of the proper name into its common noun sense, but
rather a perpetual renewal of reference, rendering each instance of the
noun, in effect, a proper name.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 Like the stipulative variable, this "rose" has no memory. The reference
 is concentrated within each instance of the word, rendering it an
 autonomous, self-same entity. And once made an entity in this way,
 the word can finally become the proper object of the poet's love:
 "When I said A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose," Stein writes,
 "[a]nd then later made that into a ring I made poetry and what did I
 do I caressed completely caressed and addressed a noun" (<i>L,</i> 231).


<h3>

Linguistic Indeterminacy: 
<br />
A Dog's View
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The repudiation of nouns in "Poetry and Grammar" occurs initially
as a way of rejecting a poetic tradition that Stein imagines has
deadened literature by wearing nouns out. But even as her own project
of modernizing poetry depends on identifying nouns as depleted names,
her realization of that project depends not on rejecting

<b></b>

names for their tendency to wither into nouns, but rather on revitalizing
nouns by making them work like names&#8212;by making them "mean names
without naming them." I have been arguing that the way names have of
"being attached to those that bear them" involves a certain immediacy
of reference that goes along with imagining the rose to be "red for the
first time in English poetry for a hundred years." But if that immediacy
of reference is also what makes it possible to imagine caressing the
rose as a matter of caressing the <i>noun</i>, that is, the <i>name</i>
of the rose, then one might easily argue that what it means for the name
of the rose to be so palpably physicalized is for the word itself to be
valued as a strictly <i>material</i> object.

<p>
Not surprisingly, therefore, the single most prevalent gesture in
the growing body of recent criticism emphasizing Stein's linguistic
concerns is an insistence on the material features of words in her
texts&#8212;particularly their sound, substance, and shape. Thus,
in an early issue of <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i> that documents a series
of poets' responses to Stein's <i>Tender Buttons,</i> Jackson Mac Low
pays particular attention to his own physical experience of her words:
"I go from word to word, seeing the shapes of the printed words, hearing
the sounds inwardly, noting rhymes, assonances, alliterations."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 MacLow's response is typical not only of the specific readings of
 Stein in that volume, but of the materialism that the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
 movement has come to represent more generally.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>

<p>
Ron Silliman's version of that materialism, for example, laments "the
disappearance of the word that lies at the heart of the invention of
the illusion of realism and the breakdown of gestural poetic form."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 For Silliman, this loss can be remedied by the disjunctive
 compositional practices&#8212;what he terms in a later essay "the
 new sentence"&#8212;of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets, with Stein as a
 privileged predecessor. Silliman argues that "transparent realism"
 causes the word's purest materiality&#8212;its sound and shape&#8212;to
 disappear, for by "gestural poetic form" he apparently has in mind
 something akin to rhyme, rhythm, and measure: "It is precisely the
 expressive integrity of the gestural use of language which constitutes
 the meaning of the 'nonsense' syllables in tribal poetries; its
 persistence in such characteristics of Skelton's poetry as its rhyme
 is that of a trace" (<i>NS,</i> 11). But Silliman's commitment to
 "gestural poetic form" is not, as his comments might suggest, an
 effort to celebrate meaninglessness; rather, he imagines that the
 pure sound and shape of syllables can "constitute meaning." Moreover,
 meaning so constituted has as its overriding characteristic the
 familiar tinge of indeterminacy. In arguing for an analogy among
 three different forms of linguistic combination&#8212;the ways that
 syllables and phonemes "integrate" into words and phrases, words and
 phrases integrate into sentences, and sentences integrate into larger
 units of composition&#8212;Silliman insists on both a finite degree
 of commensurability among the materials of language and an infinite
 (and hence, indeterminate) range of possibilities for understanding
 them. He cites Tzvetan Todorov to make this point:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
While in speech the integration of units does not go beyond the
sentence, in literature sentences are integrated again as part of larger
articulations [e.g., the paragraph], and the latter in their turn into
units of greater dimension, and so on until we have the entire

<b></b>

work. . . . On the other hand the interpretations of each unit are
innumerable, for their comprehension depends on the system in which it
will be included. [<i>NS,</i> 74]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But why should an insistence on the irreducible materiality of language
go along with an insistence on its indeterminacy (or, in Todorov's
formulation, the innumerability of its interpretations)?

<p>
It is easy to see why, once recognizing the materiality of language
becomes a way of recognizing language as an <i>object</i>. And for
Silliman's fellow L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E theorist Charles Bernstein, linguistic
materiality translates quite precisely into linguistic objecthood, a
pure physicality that, like Silliman's "gesture," constantly threatens
to disappear:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The visibility of words
<br />
as a precondition of reading
<br />
necessitates that words obtrude impermeably into
<br />
the world&#8212;this
<br />
impermeability makes a reader's absorption
<br />
in words possible. The <i>thickness</i>
<br />
of words ensures that whatever
<br />
of their physicality is erased, or engulfed, in
<br />
the process of semantic projection,
<br />
a residue
<br />
tenaciously in-
<br />
heres that will not be sublimated
<br />
away.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "thickness" of words refers quite literally to their dimensions
on the page as physical piles of ink&#8212;in other words, to their
status as marks. "The 'mark'," Bernstein writes, "is the visible sign of
writing. / But reading, insofar as it consumes &amp; / absorbs the mark,
erases it&#8212;the words disappear / (the transparency effect) &amp;
are replaced by / that which they depict, their "meaning" ("AA," 64). The
pathos of loss that Bernstein attaches to the mark is to be remedied,
he argues, by "anti-absorptive" poetic practices that foreground the
material features of words.

<p>
For Bernstein, as for Silliman, the privileged example of such
antiabsorptive poetics is the chant or incantation, whose syllabic units
are defined as such by their lack of semantic meaning.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Moreover, Bernstein (again sharing Silliman's view) insists that the
 resistance to semantic meaning does not "cede meaning" altogether ("AA,"
 10). Rather, he imagines a meaning whose function is experiential as
 opposed to semantic:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the artifice [of a poem] is
<br />
foregrounded, there's a tendency to say that there
<br />
is no content or meaning, as if the poem were a
<br />
formal or decorative exercise concerned only with
<br />
representing its own mechanisms. But even when a
<br />
poem is read as a formal exercise, the dynamics &amp;
<br />
contours of its formal proceedings may suggest, for

<b></b>

<br />
example, a metonymic model for imagining
<br />
experience. For this reason, consideration
<br />
of the formal dynamics of a poem does not necessarily
<br />
disregard its content; indeed it is an obvious
<br />
starting point insofar as it can initiate a
<br />
multilevel reading. But to complete the process
<br />
such formal apprehensions need to move to a
<br />
synthesis beyond technical cataloging, toward the
<br />
experiential phenomenon that is made by virtue of
<br />
the work's techniques. ["AA," 10-1]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
For our purposes, the force of this passage lies not in the degree to
which the "form" of a poem (i.e., the <i>material</i> of the poem) can
yield an "experiential" rather than a semantic meaning; the real force
lies in the absolute necessity and completeness of that displacement. When
words become marks (or incantatory syllables), we have no choice but
to experience them because&#8212;if we want to continue to apprehend
them as material objects&#8212;we can no longer think of ourselves as
reading them. That is, we can no longer think of ourselves as reading
them because we can no longer think of them as language.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
Of course, once words become marks, they will, as a function of
their objecthood, yield innumerable experiences&#8212;as many as the
subjects who view them and the times and circumstances in which they
are viewed. Therefore, insofar as Bernstein wishes to see experience
as type of meaning, indeterminacy would likewise seem to be a necessary
consequence of his "anti-absorptive" poetics. But if a commitment to the
mark does entail a commitment to indeterminacy, that commitment hardly
counts as linguistic. Nevertheless, both Bernstein and Silliman (and
a host of other L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E affiliates) insist on reading Stein's
poetry and poetics as predicated upon an acknowledgment of linguistic
indeterminacy. I have already argued that her theory of reference
with respect to proper names not only does not involve any claim to
indeterminacy but is intrinsically antithetical to it. But this argument
is mistaken if Stein's claim to have "caressed and addressed a noun"
is a claim to have caressed and addressed a literal object.

<p>
"The second you are you because your little dog knows you you cannot
make a master-piece," Stein writes in "What Are Master-pieces and Why Are
There So Few of Them" . The reason there are so few "master-pieces"
(of course Stein considers her own to be among the few), is "because
mostly people live in identity and memory. . . . They know they are they
because their little dog knows them, and so they are not an entity but
an identity."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Certainly it's tempting to read Stein's insistence on that term "entity"
 as a concession to the idea that the nouns (and, for that matter, all
 the other parts of speech) in her writing have the status of objects
 rather than words. But in fact it is Stein's concept of identity that
 is closest to the relationship between experience and materiality that
 I have shown to be associated with objecthood.

<p>
The identity conferred upon us by our dogs is purely a function of
experience, as Stein explains in <i>The Geographical History of America:
The Relation of Human Nature to the Human Mind</i> . Over the
course of that work's effort to enumerate

<b></b>

what counts as human nature (namely all the behaviors and instincts we
share with animals) as opposed to what counts as the human mind (namely
all that is particularly human and, most importantly, associated with the
creation of masterpieces), "identity" emerges, as one might guess, firmly
on the side of human (and, for that matter, canine) nature. Your identity,
Stein argues, is a function not of anything intrinsic or essential about
you, but rather of there being some experiencing subject&#8212;any
dog will do&#8212;to remember and identify you. Entity, by contrast,
has nothing to do with memory or identity, and insofar as masterpieces
attain their status by virtue of being entities (and not identities),
what makes them masterpieces has nothing to do with any particular
subject's experience of them. This is why, for Stein, personal letters
cannot be masterpieces:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the letter writes what the other person is to hear and so entity does not
exist there are two present instead of one and so once again creation
breaks down. I once wrote in writing <i>The Making of Americans</i> I
write for myself and strangers but that was merely a literary formalism
for if I did write for myself and strangers then identity would take
the place of entity.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The standard of value that determines whether a work is a
master-piece&#8212;i.e., whether it is an entity&#8212;is therefore in
no way determined by the response or experience of an audience. Or,
to reframe this idea in the terms of our discussion of Bernstein and
Silliman, a work of art is a master-piece, by Stein's account, precisely
to the degree that it is not an object of experience.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, when Stein writes that she has made a ring with her line "Rose is a
rose is a rose is a rose," what finally makes her rose "red for the first
time in a hundred years"&#8212;what submits that noun to her imaginative
<i>caress</i>&#8212;is not any particular material feature of the noun
capable of being felt by whoever might wish to caress it. The name of the
rose is not red because of anyone's experience of its redness. Moreover,
the name of the rose is not red by virtue of pointing to something
red. Rather than denoting a relation between the name and the redness of
its bearer, each "rose" in Stein's ring denotes instead a reference to
redness that inheres <i>in the name</i>. If Stein can "really caress" the
noun by rendering it as a name, it is neither the material form&#8212;the
petals and thorns&#8212;of the floral object it denotes nor the material
form&#8212;the sound and shape&#8212;of the word that denotes it. What
Stein caresses in caressing the "rose" is the immaterial form&#8212;the
very function of reference&#8212;belonging to the name itself.

In addition to important essays by poets Charles Bernstein and Ron
Silliman, which I will discuss below, the following critical works
are among the many that characterize Stein's language as postmodern,
which is to say, as indeterminate: Marjorie Perloff, <i>Poetics of
Indeterminacy</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1981);
Ellen Berry, <i>Curved Thought and Textual Wandering: Gertrude Stein's
Postmodernism</i> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1992);

Zukofsky to Susan Howe</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992);
Alison Rieke, <i>The Senses of Nonsense</i> (Iowa City: University of Iowa
Press, 1992). By contrast, for a recent attempt to extricate Stein from
the grip of postmodernism, see Nicola Pitchford, "Unlikely Modernism,
Unlikely Postmodernism: Stein's <i>Tender Buttons,</i>" <i>American
Literary History</i> 11.4 (Winter 1999): 642-67. Unfortunately, although
Pitchford neglects to engage the postmodernizing accounts of Stein
that appear in the context of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writing, she reinscribes
Stein's style as postmodernist in exactly their terms. She does so by
insisting that it foregrounds the materiality of the signifier (its
"shape and sound")&#8212;a hallmark gesture of the kinds of arguments
made by L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E affiliates, and, as I will show, a gesture that
is logically committed to indeterminacy .

I am in a sense conflating Russell's reactions to different arguments
about how names signify in the absence of any extension. Frege, as I
have shown, argues for stipulating a reference for the name or denoting
phrase, which is not the same as granting it any actual extension in
the form of objects. Nevertheless, stipulating a reference does in
effect stipulate the possibility of an object, which is why I argue
that Russell's objection to the category of denoting phrases that have
no extension (e.g., "the present King of France" or "the round square")
effectively applies to the category of stipulated references in Frege as
well. See Russell, "On Denoting" , in <i>Logic and Knowledge,</i>

Albert Cook invokes a notion of reference similar to the one I am arguing
for in "Some Notes on Stein and Deixis," <i>Arizona Quarterly</i> 53,
no. 1 (Spring 1997): 91-102. Insofar as "deixis" is a term for Cook
that emphasizes the principle of reference rather than particular
referents, his argument is consonant with mine. But when he claims
that the speaker of Stein's <i>Stanzas in Meditation</i>  "can
rest in the unswervability of deixis that language endorses" and also
"occasionally incorporate Steinian ungrammaticalness," he fails to
see that grammaticality (which is present even when it is violated)
is the constant and necessary <i>condition</i> for the deixis he wishes
to celebrate.

<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
In <i>Henry James, Gertrude Stein, and the Biographical Act</i>
(Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996), Charles
Caramello sees <i>Four in America</i> as an exercise in what he calls
"autoreferentiality" (169-200 passim). This term might be applicable
to my understanding of how names function for Stein if the prefix
"auto" signified the way in which names denote their own principle of
operation. For Caramello, however, the term means "self" and the four
res in <i>Four in America</i> provide a means for Stein to refer in
code to her own cultural status as an artist.

<p>
Surely no one could doubt that the discourse of atomic physics changed
utterly at 8:15 <small>A.M.</small> on Monday, 6 August 1945. Nuclear
fission had only been definitively accomplished seven years before, and
its use for a bomb, rather than for the positive energy source that some
theorists had imagined, was the result of the secret laboratory work of
a few physicists and government sponsors.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 The U.S. bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki represented not only
 a shift in global political power, but also a major change in what
 Tom Wilkie calls "the style of science"&#8212;from the "era of the
 great university laboratories" (such as Ernest Rutherford's Cavendish
 Laboratory at Cambridge) to the era of "big science," of Los Alamos.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 But perhaps the biggest transformation occurred in the way the public
 came to understand atomic physics. The popular vision of the discipline
 as arcane and theoretical&#8212;as characterized by X rays and obscure
 energy sources&#8212;was replaced by horrific images from Hiroshima:
 human bodies turned to ashes or shadows; people who were not even
 at the bomb site suffering from a mysterious, incurable illness; and
 people at ground zero who saw the flash but heard nothing while others
 miles away heard a deafening blast. In other words, one could no longer
 speak of atomic physics without also speaking of biology, of bodies.

<p>
One of the many people who groped for a vocabulary with which to
understand Hiroshima was Edith Sitwell, whose "Three Poems of the Atomic
Age" consisted of "Dirge for the New Sunrise," "The Shadow of Cain,"
and "The Canticle of the Rose."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 These poems were perhaps the strongest works of the last phase of her
 career, although the most sustained discussion of them

<b></b>

has primarily focused on their religious implications.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Certainly Sitwell would have approved of the perceptive religious
 readings of the nature of guilt in her poems, but the tight focus
 upon theology seems not to have permitted these scholars to consider
 the vast array of scientific concepts invoked in the poems <i>as
 science</i>. Rather, they are treated (if they are examined at all)
 as symbols for religious concepts.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The wide range of scientific texts evoked in these poems should,
 however, be given as much weight as the religious themes. Indeed,
 revisiting Sitwell's later work provides an argument for her
 significance not simply as a poet characterized by her early radical
 sound and word experiments in <i>Fa&ccedil;ade,</i> her eccentric dress
 and self-presentation, and her endless skirmishes with The Movement
 over the legacy of modernism, but rather as a thinker who complicates
 our sense of the interaction between public and scientific cultures in
 the immediate post-World War II era. Sitwell's atomic bomb poems, and
 "The Shadow of Cain" most strikingly, muster an array of scientific
 texts from several centuries to trace the role of the organic in the
 now-dangerous atomic order. They argue for a reintegration of the
 organic with the inorganic, of biology, natural history, and ethics
 with physics. She strategically uses alchemy and other discredited
 sciences to critique the conceptual bifurcation of the organic and
 inorganic worlds that in modern atomic physics had led to such lethal
 consequences.

<p>
Sitwell recognized that the bomb almost instantaneously caused a shift
in the broader public perception of physics&#8212;one that entailed a
serious rethinking of the roles of biology and of <i>life</i> itself in
the seemingly cold and intellectually detached realm of

<b></b>

atomic physics. The blurring of the disciplinary boundary between modern
physics and biology had certainly occurred before. Evelyn Fox Keller
has chronicled the debate that the Second Law of Thermodynamics 
caused "concerning the place of living systems in the laws of physics."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 The search for increasingly efficient steam engine models, ones that
 could transform heat into mechanical energy without loss of energy, led
 to the Second Law, which very quickly entailed a number of different
 and vexing concerns for scientists and the general public during the
 Victorian and even the modernist period. One of the most prominent
 issues was what Hermann von Helmholtz called "thermal death." As
 Ernest Rutherford asserted half a century later, "Science offers no
 escape from the conclusion of Kelvin and Helmholtz that the sun must
 ultimately grow cold and this earth become a dead planet moving through
 the intense cold of empty space."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Fears of inevitable, frigid planetary death racked res from Charles
 Darwin (who lamented that millions of years of evolution would end in
 the natural cooling of the planet) to H. G. Wells and D. H. Lawrence.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
As this example demonstrates, scientific "breakthroughs" can precipitate
crises. Different scientific discourses&#8212;or science and other
discourses&#8212;seem incompatible, and micro- and macro-level
explanations do not appear to be reconcilable. I want to argue that
the atomic bomb precipitated such a moment. Physics, the life sciences,
and understandings of human agency in the natural world seemed to reel
from what Sitwell clearly perceived as the simultaneously moral and
scientific blow of nuclear fission.

<p>
Atomic physics had provoked the imagination in primarily positive ways
before the bomb. Countless people marveled at seeing through opaque
matter with X rays, and wondered about the possibilities of mysterious
energy rays. In the 1930s Sitwell herself had turned to atomic energy as
a positive metaphor for the power of modernism. Praising T. S. Eliot's
work, she asserts:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The older beauty, the beauty of the old masters, is the beauty of species
and mass&#8212;the new beauty is highly individualised and separate. The
modern artist is not concerned with things in the mass, he is passionately
interested in the fulfilling of the destinies of the single individuals
that make up the mass&#8212;whether these individuals are men, or leaves,
or waves of the sea. The great quality of the old masters is force, used
in the scientific term of the word&#8212;the binding together of the
molecules of the world. That is partly what makes their sense of design
so tremendous. The great quality of the modern masters is an explosive
energy, the separating up of the molecules, exploring the possibilities
of the atom.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is at once the quality and the danger of pioneer poetry. The aim
of the modernist poets&#8212;the constant aim&#8212;is to reconcile this
necessity of exploring the possibilities of the atom with the necessity
for logical design and form.

<p>
Portraying modernism in terms of individualism, antimass sentiments,
and iconoclasm was nothing new. These terms had been around since before
Sitwell had first appeared on the London scene during World War I. But
Sitwell moves into unusual territory as well, exploring individualism
and energy with atomic-age metaphor, combining modernist "pioneering"
with scientific exploration.

<b></b>

<p>
But when the bomb made the concentrated release of radioactivity into
a destructive reality, and not just an optimistic metaphor, Sitwell was
forced to turn the clock as far back from 1945 as the sixteenth century in
order to rethink the relationship between biology and atomic physics. The
life sciences and physics for the most part had gone their separate ways,
and nineteenth-century evolutionary models of life largely dissociated
themselves from&#8212;and displaced&#8212;religious dogma. After the
bomb, though, Sitwell rejected the twentieth-century atomic physics that
had contributed to its creation. She seems to have read Albert Einstein
and Cambridge astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington, but I find no evidence in
the poems or notebooks of her grappling with the studies of Rutherford,
Frederick Soddy, Enrico Fermi, or Niels Bohr, for instance.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Rather, after exploring the natural history of the planet in works
 by nineteenth-century thinkers, such as Ernst Haeckel, Charles
 Lyell, and Lorenz Oken, she turned to much older texts, including
 the seventeenth-century natural history treatise of Thomas Burnet
 and, most markedly, the sixteenth-century alchemical writings of
 Paracelsus. These thinkers united physics, the life sciences, and
 religion into seamless systems.

<p>
It is no coincidence that Sitwell would turn to alchemical
writings. Alchemy had often been invoked in the early years of atomic
physics: Rutherford's 1899 experiments showed that decaying radioactive
elements could induce radioactivity in other substances, and with Soddy
he discovered that thorium was transmuting itself into helium.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 As Linda Henderson notes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Although Rutherford cautiously used the terms "transformation" and
"sub-atomic chemical changes" in his publications, he would later title
his [1937] book on radioactivity <i>The Newer Alchemy.</i> By contrast,
Soddy, a chemist with a prior interest in alchemy, immediately cultivated
the association of radioactivity with alchemy in his lectures, his
articles and, ultimately, his 1909 book, <i>The Interpretation of
Radium.</i> Soddy even suggested in print that radium might be the
alchemist's long-sought "Philosopher's Stone," capable of transmuting
metals and serving as well as the "elixir of life." [<i>DC,</i> 23]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Modern popularizers of alchemy likewise saw the discovery of
radioactive decay as evidence confirming their beliefs (<i>DC,</i>
24-5). Yet the atomic paths pursued by Rutherford and his successors
led not to productive and life-giving transmutation, but rather to
the most powerful weapon ever used. Just as alchemy had been used as a
positive conceptualization of atomic science before the bomb, so Sitwell
strategically redeployed one of the most famous of all alchemists to
reconre the orientation and responsibilities of nuclear physics.

<p>
In the nuclear age, her atomic bomb poems suggest, gold represents the
human greed that causes wars (the biblical res in the poems, Dives
and Cain, symbolize this drive for material gain); the Sun symbolizes
the extreme heat of the bomb blast; and alchemy evokes the horrific
transformations of elements and bodies by atomic physics and the hidden
secret essences of elements that the "newer alchemy" had discovered
could damage or transform the hidden, genetic essences of life through
radiation sickness, cancer, and birth defects.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 However, Sitwell reevaluates and transres each of these terms by
 returning to early modern science. For Burnet, the

<b></b>

conflagration of the earth is only a natural step toward salvation. For
Paracelsus, alchemy was a healing art: gold is the quintessence of
the sun, and is linked to the cure for leprosy, a disease that rots
the ailing body just as radiation burns the flesh. Thus, for Sitwell,
Hiroshima and Nagasaki come to represent a kind of self-inflicted leprosy.

<p>
Sitwell's unpublished notebooks show her writing and rewriting the atomic
bomb poems&#8212;sometimes dozens of times&#8212;as well as dictating
reading lists to herself and making notes on the texts that ultimately
were incorporated into these poems. Her notebooks and the poems' final
published versions suggest that she conceived not of a physics that
exempts life from its calculations (as Kelvin reluctantly posited),
but rather of one that restores life to a central place.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 The return to early modern science was not a na&iuml;ve reactionary
 diatribe against contemporary science, but rather an imaginative call
 for modern physics (and the society that employs it) to rethink the
 segregation of the sciences from each other and to focus on the larger
 picture in an essentially ethical way.

<p>
To illustrate this call for scientific reintegration, I will focus on
"The Shadow of Cain," which contains the fullest elaboration of Sitwell's
scientific synthesis. The poem's introductory stanzas initiate the wide
range of scientific perspectives and natural phenomena that she wished
to combine. The poem is set in a biting cold that would seem to be the
obverse of the destructive heat of the atomic blasts in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki: "Under great yellow flags and banners of the ancient Cold /
Began the huge migrations / From some primeval disaster in the heart
of Man."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Just as earlier intellectuals had worried about the heat death of the
 planet, Sitwell begins the poem with a strident but chronologically
 nebulous evocation of extreme cold and its consequences. Her approach
 recalls the Christian concept of the Fall, but also employs words
 that connote the scientific discourses to follow. "Huge migrations"
 and "primeval" seem more related to the discourse of natural history
 and evolution than to Genesis, and "ancient Cold," while seeming
 to reverse the temporal direction of the heat death of the planet,
 introduces a concept that will immediately be taken up again in several
 scientific paradigms.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Major nineteenth-century texts on natural history and evolutionary
biology inspire the poem's vision of the interconnectedness of organic and
inorganic processes in the history of the planet. In the second stanza,
the coldness is linked to terms directly out of natural history texts:
"There were great oscillations / Of temperature. . . . You knew there
had once been warmth" (<i>CP,</i> 366). These lines (and many of the
following stanzas) allude to Charles Lyell's magnum opus, <i>Principles
of Geology.</i> Lyell used the systematic study of fossil and geological
evidence to conclude that plant and animal species had come into being and
become extinct throughout millions of years of geographical and climatic
change before any human had walked the earth. His conclusion predated
Darwin's evolutionary writings and helped to cause the crisis of faith
that famously inspired Tennyson's bleakest moments in <i>In Memoriam</i>.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Yet, responding some hundred years later to the same passages from Lyell
 that Tennyson read, Sitwell does not seem uncomfortable with the fact
 of evolution. She was reading Darwin while working on drafts of "The
 Shadow," but beyond a single reference to Darwin in a passage seemingly
 taken from Thomas Huxley's <i>Lectures on Evolution</i> , Darwin
 does not seem to have significantly influenced these poems.

<b></b>

<p>
In her notes for the essay, "The Making of a Poem II: The Shadow of Cain,"
Sitwell writes, "In Sir Charles Lyell's 'Geology,' there is a description
of the finding of a mammoth's tooth with a pine-leaf, symbol that there
had once been warmth, hid in the crevice. He speaks too of the variation
in temperature in that early stage of the earth's history."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 In the sixth and seventh stanzas of the published poem, Sitwell provides
 imagistic specificity to the concept:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And now, in memory of great oscillations
<br />
Of temperature in that epoch of the Cold,
<br />
We found a continent of turquoise, vast as Asia
<br />
In the yellowing airs of the Cold: the tooth of a mammoth;
<br />
And there, in a gulf, a dark pine-sword
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
To show there had once been warmth and the gulf stream in our veins
<br />
Where only the Chaos of the Antarctic Pole
<br />
Or the peace of its atonic coldness reigns. [<i>CP,</i> 366-7]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In volume one of <i>Principles of Geology</i>, Lyell explores the fossil
evidence of the mammoth to demonstrate gradual climate shifts on the
planet and their effect on different species. He rules out the mammoth
as a migratory species, refuting the theory that they went extinct as the
climate first became colder, and concludes that "The increasing cold, and
greater frequency of inclement winters, would at last thin [the mammoths],
and their final extirpation would be consummated by the rapid augmentation
of other herbivorous quadrupeds more fitted for the new climate."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Though the description may seem callous, for Lyell&#8212;and indeed
 for Sitwell&#8212;the fossils merely write a chapter in the history
 of natural climate change and species adaptability.

<p>
Sitwell does not explicitly cite Lyell in her published notes to the poem,
but his presence is felt in the poem's multiple allusions to "primal" and
"primeval" "disasters" of climate and glaciation (stanza ten), and its
many allusions to now extinct species, such as the mammoth (stanza six),
megatherium mylodon (stanza nine), mastodon (stanzas nine and twenty-one),
and pterodactyl (stanza eleven). But in revising the general statement
"there had once been warmth" to "there had once been warmth and the gulf
stream in our veins," Sitwell not only emphasizes human morality (not a
feature of Lyell's writing), but also makes humanity part of the larger
natural history of the planet rather than a separate, superior history.

<p>
To provide a vision of human beings and their ancestors as part of a
natural organic and inorganic world, Sitwell turned from Lyell to another
evolutionist, Ernst Haeckel. He is present (if unacknowledged) throughout
the early passages of "Shadow." Sitwell copied multiple passages from his
<i>The Riddle of the Universe at the Close of the Nineteenth Century</i>
(or <i>Die Weltr&auml;thsel</i> [1900]) into her notes, and grappled
with his discussion of <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> in a number of
revisions of "Shadow."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Haeckel, who taught at Jena, was a nineteenth-century zoologist
 who fought against religious dogma for the validity of evolutionary
 theory. Like Sitwell, he desired a greater integration of the sciences
 into philosophy. "Unfortunately," he argued, "this vast progress

<b></b>

of empirical knowledge in our 'Century of Science' has not been
accompanied by a corresponding advancement of its theoretical
interpretation&#8212;that higher knowledge of the causal nexus of
individual phenomena which we call philosophy" (<i>RU,</i> v). Calling
for a "philosophy of nature" that would go beyond pure empirical research,
but that would use research to ground what he saw as the merely abstract
philosophical musings of the metaphysicians, Haeckel developed a theory of
"Monistic Philosophy" that reconciled these seemingly disparate projects.

<p>
Haeckel clearly saw himself as exploring the consequences of Darwin's
theories of evolution and natural selection. In a chapter on "The History
of Our Species," he writes a brief history of evolutionary thought,
praising Lyell, Lamarck, and Darwin for breaking theological fetters.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 He lauds his own work, <i>General Morphology of Organisms</i> 
 and his popularizing <i>Natural History of Creation</i> , for
 addressing "one of the most pressing of the many important tasks
 which Darwin proposed to modern biology . . . the reform of the
 zoological and botanical <i>system</i>" (<i>RU,</i> 80). In these
 earlier books, he argued that the "history of the embryo (ontogeny)
 must be completed by a second, equally valuable, and closely connected
 branch of thought&#8212;the history of the race (phylogeny)" (ibid.). He
 affirms the "theory of the descent of man from the ape" from Lamarck,
 Darwin, and others, and uses paleontology, ontogeny, and morphology to
 sketch an ancestral tree for humans as far back as "Silurian fishes"
 (<i>RU,</i> 83-4).

<p>
Haeckel's emphasis on phylogeny and biological systems influenced
Sitwell's notes and drafts of "Shadow," and she worked materials from
his chapter on "The History of Our Species" directly into the poem. In
notebook 61, Sitwell took notes on Haeckel's evolutionary sequence:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Pithecanthropus erectus. P.71 Haeckel. The Mesozoic mammals. The Triassic
period, the marsupials in the Jurassic. Eocene (period?) Miocene.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the Pliocene period arises the Ape-Man without speech (the
pithecanthropus alalus). Meso[crosses out "zoic" and writes "lithic"]
Stone Age between paleolithic and neolithic. Mesophyll: Danei [?] of
leaf; mesozoic: [?] [?] geological period / Paleontology: study of
extinct organized beings. [<i>N,</i> 61]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sitwell copied directly from the end of the chapter a passage on
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus,</i> which Haeckel saw as important because it
"served to elucidate the origin of the placentals related to our own stem,
the legion of primates" (<i>RU,</i> 86). Sitwell wrote:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The most famous and most interesting of these discoveries is the fossil
ape-man of Java, the much-talked-of <i>pithecanthropus erectus,</i>
found by a Dutch military doctor, Eugen Dubois, in 1894. It is in truth
the much-sought "missing link," supposed to be wanting in the chain of
primates, which stretches unbroken from the lowest catarrhin&aelig;, to
the highest-developed man. I have dealt exhaustively with the significance
of this discovery in the paper which I read on August 26th, 1898, at
the Fourth International Zoological Congress at Cambridge.[. . .] The
pal&aelig;ontologist, who knows the conditions of the formation and
preservation of fossils, will think the discovery of this pithecanthropus
an unusually lucky accident. The apes, being arboreal, seldom came into
the circumstances (unless

<b></b>

they happened to fall into the water) which would secure the preservation
and petrifaction of their skeleton. Thus, by the discovery of this
fossil man-monkey of Java the descent of man from the ape has become
just as clear and certain from the pal&aelig;ontological side as it was
previously from the evidence of comparative anatomy and ontogeny. We
now have all the principal documents which tell the history of our
race. [<i>N,</i> 61]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Haeckel's certitude regarding his ability to "tell the history of our
race" seems to have inspired the scientific confidence that Sitwell
needed to ground her religious poem firmly in a dynamic and developing
natural world.

<p>
Early drafts of stanzas eight, nine, and ten of "Shadow" more explicitly
allude to the passage she copied from <i>Riddle</i> and provide a more
detailed sense of Sitwell's debt to Haeckel than the published poem
does. There are three notebooks (61, 64, and 310) that contain drafts
of passages inspired by Haeckel. Notebook 310, probably the earliest
of the three, situates his phylogeny in the larger context of inorganic
processes:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />

<br />

<p>

<br />
Processions of suns [<i>N,</i> 310]
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Most of these stanzas were not published, but were early drafts of what
finally was published as stanzas nine and ten. From Lyell-inspired
thought about the procession of eras and formation of sediment and
fossil remains of extinct creatures (the megatherium), Sitwell turns to
Haeckel to invoke human ancestors that were like us but could not speak,
only to compare them to the current breakdown in communication after the
bomb. Communication and human compassion, the stretching out of hands,
has been forgotten in the face of death. But Sitwell then res death
as part of a process that also involves the renewal of life through sap
and spring. Death and

<b></b>

inorganic processes (such as the climatic changes Lyell
describes)&#8212;the "influence of the external inorganic world"&#8212;are
brought into a picture of cosmic proportions. They are, perhaps, a kind
of consolation in this early draft, precisely because they were not
caused by humans. The manipulation of the inorganic world by nuclear
fission creates a violent "procession of suns" that has no meaning in
the larger geological and biological history.

<p>
The version in notebook 61 encompasses what became stanza nine in the
published poem (and correctly names <i>Pithecanthropus alalus</i>),
but also includes a passage that eventually was transformed into stanza
six of the published version, firmly tying Lyell's geological vision to
Haeckel's phylogeny.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Finally, the version in notebook 64 (which is too long to quote in
 full), brings together several versions of stanza six (the turquoise,
 pine-sword, glaciation/oscillation stanza), with versions of stanza ten
 and other stanzas containing allusions to <i>Pithecanthropus alalus.</i>
 It also bring together elements of stanzas ten and eleven of the
 published version, introducing the "iron-wing" allusion to the airplane
 that dropped the bomb with the eventually omitted <i>Pithecanthropus
 erectus</i> passage:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->

<br />

[<i>N</i>, 64]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sitwell seemed to have had in mind a kind of natural history lesson
for the poem. The development of human beings from not only prehuman
primates, but even preprimate animals, the extinction and change of
species as a constant rule of nature, the effect of the inorganic on
those processes, the development of speech in the ancient past with
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>: all of these echoes of nineteenth-century
evolutionary biology and paleontology seem aimed at creating a sense
of our embeddedness in the larger organic and even inorganic schemes of
the planet.

<p>
In the poem's published version little remains of Sitwell's detailed
notes on Haeckel, or of her early drafts. But the will to read

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The trace of the first letters we could not read:
<br />

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And of the slow subsidence of a Race;
<br />

<br />
In which the Megatherium Mylodon
<br />

<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
signifies Haeckel's presence. The shift from <i>Pithecanthropus alalus</i>
to <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> in Haeckel is consigned to a past in
which "There was still some method of communication / Between Man and his
brother Man," and the challenge for humanity now is not to subside into
silence and cold (ibid.). But the sense of migration, quest, and even
paleontological and geological expedition that Sitwell had, in part,
borrowed from Lyell changes here as she moves mankind into a prehistory
charted by Haeckel.

<p>
Haeckel, though, had more to offer than the consolations of paleontology
(one draft in notebook 64 had lamented: "And we were left with our
Paleontology&#8212; / Our cold study of that most ancient race, the race
of the Dead"). Some elements of his work could be tied into another aspect
of the poem: physics. Sitwell wanted a greater sense of interconnected
system than Lyell, Darwin, or even Haeckel's zoology could provide, so she
also turned to aspects of Haeckel's work that asked larger questions about
the realm of physics. In the draft of another omitted stanza, she writes:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
It was the time of Love.
<br />
The meeting of atoms . . . Love, in the summer grass . . .
<br />
In the halls of tenements
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
It was the time of love . . .
<br />
The accidental collision of motes in the light of the sun [<i>N,</i> 64]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
It is unclear where Sitwell was headed with these lines, but they seem
to raise two possibilities: that love, one of the most revered human
emotions, is simply a "meeting of atoms," an "accidental collision of
motes in the light of the sun," or that the fortuitous concourse of
atoms in fact has a principle behind it that might be described in terms
of love.

<p>
These lines may have been inspired by Sitwell's readings of Haeckel's
attempt to link the animate and inanimate. She frequently wrote a
list of page numbers in the front or back of a book for passages she
found especially interesting. Apart from the <i>Pithecanthropus</i>
discussion, the passages that she marked in Haeckel all tend to involve
his attempts to bridge seemingly separate, irreconcilable worlds. In
one passage he unites the plant and animal kingdoms, and then goes
even further&#8212;returning to Spinoza to help propound his own
monism. Haeckel writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every single object in the world which comes within the sphere of our
cognizance, all individual forms of existence, are but special transitory
forms&#8212;<i>accidents</i> or <i>modes</i> of

<b></b>

substance. These modes are material things when we regard them under the
attribute of <i>extension</i> (or "occupation of space"), but forces or
ideas when we consider them under the attribute of <i>thought</i> (or
"energy"). To this profound thought of Spinoza our purified monism returns
after a lapse of two hundred years; for us, too, matter (space-filling
substance) and energy (moving force) are but two inseparable attributes
of the one underlying substance.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
By Einstein's era, matter and energy had indeed come to be seen as
something like "two inseparable attributes of the one underlying
substance." Sitwell felt that the cold abstraction of mass/energy
conversion had somehow contributed to the nuclear holocaust, though,
and Haeckel had something much more sweeping in mind&#8212;"energy"
could also include "thought" or human sentience.

<p>
In another passage that Sitwell marked in her edition, Haeckel speaks
of atoms and molecules, fundamental building blocks, in terms of a
principle of attraction that sounds very much like the stanza on love
that she omitted from her poem:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Goethe, in his classical romance, <i>Affinities</i>, compared the
relations of pairs of lovers with the phenomenon of the same name
in the formation of chemical combinations. The irresistible passion
that draws Edward to the sympathetic Ottilia, or Paris to Helen, and
leaps over all bounds of reason and morality, is the same powerful
"unconscious" attractive force which impels the living spermatozoon to
force an entrance into the ovum in the fertilisation of the egg of the
animal or plant&#8212;the same impetuous movement which unites two atoms
of hydrogen to one atom of oxygen for the formation of a molecule of
water. This fundamental <i>unity of affinity in the whole of nature,</i>
from the simplest chemical process to the most complicated love story,
was recognised by the great Greek scientist Empedocles, in the fifth
century <small>B.C.</small>, in his theory of "the love and hatred of
the elements." It receives empirical confirmation from the interesting
progress of cellular psychology, the great significance of which we have
only learned to appreciate in the last thirty years. On those phenomena we
base our conviction that even the <i>atom</i> is not without a rudimentary
form of sensation and will, or, as it is better expressed, of feeling
(<i>&aelig;sthesis</i>) and inclination (<i>tropesis</i>)&#8212;that is,
a universal "soul" of the simplest character. The same must be said of the
molecules which are composed of two or more atoms. Further combinations of
different kinds of these molecules give rise to simple and, subsequently,
complex chemical compounds, in the activity of which the same phenomena
are repeated in a more complicated form.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Haeckel has departed from cold paleontology and hard science to
express a version of physics that had few adherents in the twentieth
century, one in which volition, love, soul, and desire still had a place.

<p>
Sitwell found, and extensively marked, one other source from
nineteenth-century science that would attempt the kind of synthesis of
the sciences and the mind that Haeckel advocated. Lorenz Oken, though
now obscure, was seen (along with Joseph Schelling and Henrich Steffens)
as one of the major <i>Naturphilosophen.</i>
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<i>Naturphilosophie,</i> a movement in the sciences during the first
third of the nineteenth century, was a loose combination of Kantian
dynamism (which Kenneth Caneva describes as "the notion that matter is
defined in terms of opposing attractive and repulsive

<b></b>

forces") and philosophical Romanticism, whose primary goal was to
challenge mechanistic explanations of nature, particularly Newtonian
physics.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Haeckel's appropriation of Goethe's notion of affinity in the natural
 world seems to follow this line of science. In a way that would
 clearly be attractive to Sitwell in her appraisal of atomic physics,
 Romantic science (as Mullen calls it) tended to substitute biology
 for physics as the major discipline. Moreover, as Mullen explains,
 the <i>Naturphilosophen</i> held "that there is an identity of nature
 and spirit, and that there is an underlying unity of organic and
 inorganic nature" ("RS," 382). Oken sought to theorize such a unity,
 and his works were of major importance to nineteenth-century attacks
 on mechanistic science.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 He attracted not only Goethe's (briefly admiring) attention, but also
 that of Coleridge, who extensively annotated his copies of <i>First
 Ideas</i> and the <i>Compendium,</i> the same work to which Sitwell
 would turn in 1946 as a philosophical anchor for her atomic bomb poems.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Sitwell's copy of Oken's <i>Compendium</i> was translated in English
as <i>Elements of Physiophilosophy</i> . As Mullen puts it,
<i>Elements</i> "stands as the best known of all nature philosophy books"
("RS," 388). Its first part, "Mathesis," propounded a cosmological
principle of generation through primal tensions initially between zero,
or nonbeing, and its opposite, being. Its second part, "Ontology,"
examined inorganic nature, viewing the creation of the world as a process
of crystallization resulting from activity in the aether. Finally, the
last section, "Biology" (a word Oken coined), posited living nature as a
process of constant transformation and attempts to approximate archetypes.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Sitwell marked pages and passages throughout her copy of <i>Elements of
Physiophilosophy</i> and seems to have read most of its 665 pages.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 It was a major influence on "Shadow" and "The Canticle of the
 Rose." Oken saw mathematics as a place from which to begin making
 a theory for the most simple of relations, that between being and
 nonbeing.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 In notebook 64, Sitwell transcribed passages from the beginning
 of "Mathesis," in particular from its first section, which was
 provocatively entitled "Nothing." She notes, drawing from Oken's
 proposition 34, "(Mathematics Oken is a something in relation to
 0. The first act towards realization or the becoming something, is an
 origination of Many. All reality can, therefore, manifest itself only
 in multiplicity" (<i>N,</i> 64). And she then copies out the following
 lines from Oken's proposition 37: "What zero is in infinite intensity,
 that are numbers in an endless extensity. Zero is of two forms: under
 the ideal it is mere intensity; under the real mere extensity, or a
 series of numbers. The latter is only expanded intensity, the former,
 extensity concentrated on the point" (ibid.).

<p>
Oken began the "Nothing" section with a line that Sitwell directly echoes
in "Shadow": "The highest mathematical idea, or the fundamental principle
of all mathematics is the zero=0. The whole science of mathematics depends
upon zero. Zero alone determines the value in mathematics. Zero is in
itself nothing. Mathematics is based upon nothing, and, consequently,
arises out of nothing" (<i>EP,</i> 5). The primal tensions between
nonbeing and being are generative. Sitwell works these ideas directly
into stanzas three, four, and five of "Shadow":

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
But the Cold is the highest mathematical Idea . . . the Cold
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is Zero&#8212;

<p>
The Nothing from which arose
<br />
All Being and all variation. . . . It is the sound too high for our
hearing, the Point that flows
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Till it becomes the line of Time . . . an endless positing
<br />
Of Nothing, or the Ideal that tries to burgeon
<br />
Into Reality through multiplying. . . . Then Time froze
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
To immobility and changed to Space. [<i>CP,</i> 366]

<p>
She grafts the idea of the absence of heat&#8212;the cold that she
had already invoked in geological and paleontological terms that
recall anxieties about thermal death&#8212;onto Oken's key concept of
zero. Space (extension), time (sequence of numbers), motion (oscillation),
and causality&#8212;all are effects of the simple positive generation
from zero.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Sitwell's early drafts of what eventually became "But the Cold is the
 highest mathematical Idea . . . the cold is Zero&#8212;" played with
 various permutations of Oken's theorizing:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The cold is Infinity; a repetition of the Ideal . . . an incessant
positing of the Idea . . .
<br />
The cold is the highest mathematical Idea, Zero
<br />
The cold is infinity . . . an incessant positing of the ideal, the
becoming something . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
What Zero is in infinite intensity
<br />
Numbers are in endless extensity. [<i>N,</i> 64]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sitwell continues Oken's logic, making a kind of positive virtue out of
the absolute cold and extreme heat of atomic physics. Nothing creates
"All Being and all variation," which creates a sequence, "the line of
Time . . . an endless positing / of Nothing."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
Oken's mathematical physics quickly move beyond the kind of cosmological
questions with which Sitwell begins her poem, into labyrinthine
explications of physics, geology, and biology. Sitwell noted passages
on metals, crystallization, minerals, and jewels, as well as the optics
of the eye, but she also marked many passages about the plant and animal
kingdoms. Many of these contain rich statements that convey the kind of
interconnectedness that she wished to reassert between the sciences. Oken
clearly saw the animal world as more complex than that of the plant.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 However, many of the passages that Sitwell marked are preoccupied with
 theories of plant life as simple yet rich systems:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1164. Root and stem are the water- and earth-plant, the leaf is the
air-plant, the flower is the light- or rather fire-plant.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1165. In the flower the problem has been solved, of producing an entire
plant simply by the light without earth, water, and air, or as it were
in a merely spiritual manner.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1166. The plant is a flower that has been posited under three ideas,
under the idea of earth, water, and air. As in aether or fire all the
elements are dissolved; so are all the

<b></b>

elements of the plant in the flower.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1167. The flower is truly, not merely in idea, the whole plant with all
systems and formations, posited under a <i>single</i> idea, under that
of the aether, namely, of the gravity, light and heat, or the fire.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1168. The flower as the aether-organ of the plant is not so independent
as an animal, but subordinated to the planetary systems, being only a
separation of the parts of the trunk, not a new formation, as in the
animal kingdom. [<i>EP,</i> 229-30]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
From these passages arose some of the language and some parts of the
conceptual scheme of "The Canticle of the Rose," the third of Sitwell's
atomic bomb poems. Stanzas two and three have the "Rose upon the wall"
crying:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I rise upon my stem&#8212;
<br />
The Flower, the whole Plant-being, produced by Light
<br />
With all Plant-systems and formations. . . . As in Fire
<br />
All elements dissolve, so in one bright
<br />
Ineffable essence all Plant-being dissolves to make the Flower.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
My stem rises bright&#8212;
<br />
Organic water polarized to the dark
<br />
Earth-center, and to Light. [<i>CP,</i> 373]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Oken had frequently discussed even animals as moveable stems and blossoms,
defining animals as "self-moveable or automatic blossoms," and noting
that "A blossom, which, when separated from the stem, maintains by its
own motion the galvanic process or the life within itself, and gets its
process of polarization, not from a body lying external to or coherent
with it (as is the vegetable stem); but only from itself&#8212;such
blossom is an <i>Animal.</i>"
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 In "Canticle," Sitwell reworks a traditional symbol for Jesus&#8212;the
 rose upon the cross&#8212;into a vision of the divine as embodied in
 the nexus of the organic and inorganic <i>systems,</i> suggesting that
 the chemistry of elements, the physics of light, and the organic life
 of the plant are inextricably intertwined.

<p>
Sitwell's poems of this period often explore the simple systems of sun,
plant, and soil, yet revel in the development of more complicated animal
systems (especially the human) that share an essential unity with those
other realms. Oken's thinking gave a richly phrased and evocative account
of these relationships. Even words, humans' greatest accomplishment,
are organic systems according to Oken. In a passage Sitwell marked,
he wrote, "Words, which are connected together according to organic
laws, form an organic system, are at once alive, and have a meaning"
(<i>EP,</i> 473). Sitwell marked the following passages as well:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1783. In so far as the animal vesicle is a whole solar system, to it,
the characters that transcend the plant, such as motion, belong.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1784. But motion is not that alone which is displayed in the floral
cyst when it has become solar; but with it there is yet something higher
bestowed.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1785. Like light or sun the vesicle has the principle of its polarization
or determination in

<b></b>

itself; and it is certainly itself which moves its organs in conformity
with this self-determination; but it is withal in antagonism towards the
elements, like the sun is towards the planets. Through this antagonism
the sun is destined unto the development of light. Although the light
is its own product, still it perceives the object toward which the
aether-polarity is directed. This perception of the direction, whither
motion should act by means of the central polarity, is in the animal
called <i>Sensation.</i>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1786. Sensation is the relation of the Central to the Peripheric, of
the sun to the planet; motion is the relation of the periphery to the
centre, of the planet to the sun. The Animal emerges into being from
the alternating play of the supremest antagonism in the heavenly bodies,
the Vegetable form that of the terrestrial antagonisms.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1787. Emission of light is discharging or unloading of the sun achieved
by the influence of the planets; sensation is unloading of the animal
by objects, by the world, and by its own organs.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1788. Sensation is therefore a positing of <i>want</i> in the
animal. Through sensation nothing comes into, but rather something passes
out of us.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
1789. The animal vesicle is a sentient or feeling blossom. [<i>EP</i>,
324-5]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Next to proposition 1785, Sitwell wrote in the margin, "Its
self-determination was destined to develop." Passages like these
fascinated her with their bold assertion of the unity of physics, the
inorganic, the organic, and even the sentient: animals as solar systems,
sensation as motion, radiation of light as a discharging of the sun like
the sensations in animals.

<p>
As in "The Canticle of the Rose," "Shadow" holds up the unity of the
organic and inorganic in the face of atomic holocaust. And as the natural
history lesson of the first few pages of "Shadow" begins to wind down,
the general "we" of the poem discovers not only Cain, Dives, and Christ,
but also a connection between the splendors of inorganic earth and its
living systems:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
There were great emerald thunders in the air
<br />
In the violent Spring, the thunders of the sap and the blood in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the heart&#8212;
<br />
The Spiritual Light, the physical Revelation. [<i>CP,</i> 368]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In the context of Oken's book, "the Spiritual Light, the physical
Revelation" suggests a broader Romantic science of physics, biology,
and spirit, and not simply an orthodox "divine revelation," as the
religious readings of the poem have suggested. And at this point the
poem turns back even further in time: it looks to early modern science
to explore the connectedness of spirit and humanity to a unified natural
world. Sitwell turns to the seventeenth-century thinker, Bishop Burnet,
and finally, but most prevalently, to the sixteenth-century alchemist,
Paracelsus, in order to explore these connections.

<p>
Lyell, Haeckel, and Oken had given Sitwell imaginative ways of gaining a
longer perspective on life on earth, and Haeckel and Oken, in particular,
had emphasized a unity in that vision that helped redress the imbalance
that the physics of Soddy, Rutherford, Oppenheim, Bohr, and others seemed
to have created. But her sources in the first part of the poem had not
offered her a theory of catastrophe on the planet that

<b></b>

could set such an event in both scientific and religious contexts. Haeckel
(who was virulently anti-Roman Catholic), Oken, and Lyell might have
had personal beliefs, but they disavowed religious dogma as scientific
explanation. Lyell, in fact, explicitly rejected notions of catastrophic
change. Yet certainly the atomic bombs required an image of change wrought
upon nature by an extreme, traumatic event. Not only did human bodies
continue to die from radiation effects for years after the blast, becoming
sterile and cancerous, but the impact upon the nonhuman&#8212;organic
and inorganic alike&#8212;was also remarkable. In a passage that might
even have suggested part of the poem's title, "Shadow," Hersey writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The scientists noticed that the flash of the bomb had discolored concrete
to a light reddish tint, had scaled off the surface of granite, and had
scorched certain other types of building material, and that consequently
the bomb had, in some places, left prints of the shadows that had been
cast by its light. . . . (A few vague human silhouettes were found, and
these gave rise to stories that eventually included fancy and precise
details . . .) [<i>H,</i> 95-6]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Shadows burned onto stone as horrific inorganic reminders of the recent
presence of the organic&#8212;tokens of human life rendered permanent
in the inorganic&#8212;was only one of the strange consequences of the
bomb. In "The Canticle of the Rose," Sitwell asks of a victim, "Where
is she now? / Dissolved and gone&#8212; / And only her red shadow stains
the unremembering stone" (<i>CP,</i> 374). Hersey notes that scientists
estimated the heat at ground zero to have been over six-thousand degrees
centigrade, and noted phenomena like melted tiles, instantly carbonized
telephone poles, fission fragments on buildings, and mica that had been
fused onto granite gravestones (<i>H,</i> 107).

<p>
After the natural history stanzas, Sitwell turned to more explicit
evocations of the cataclysmic destruction of the bomb:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The Sun descending and the Earth ascending
<br />
To take its place above . . . the Primal Matter
<br />
Was broken, the womb from which all life began,
<br />
Then to the murdered Sun a totem pole of dust arose in memory of
Man. [<i>CP,</i> 369]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In her drafts for her essay on the making of "Shadow," she writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
On the 10th of September 1945, my brother Osbert and I were in the train
on the way to Brighton where we were to give a reading. He leant across to
me and handed me The Times [sic], pointing to a paragraph in it . . . a
description by an eye witness of the horror at Hiroshima . . . That
witness had seen a totem pole of dust arise to the sun . . . . . . . a
totem pole . . . the symbol of life, the symbol of procreation . . .
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
From that moment, night and day, the poem began. But it was not written
until April of the following year. [<i>N,</i> 307]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sitwell cites the article in her notes to the poem: "Transcript
of an actual report by an eye-witness of the bomb falling on
Hiroshima.&#8212;<i>The Times,</i> September 10, 1945" (<i>CP,</i> 427).

<b></b>

One might read the evocation of "a totem pole of dust" as horribly
ironic&#8212;a symbol of life and procreation, caused by the mushroom
cloud of the bomb, to be followed by sterility and miscarriage. But the
strange effects of the catastrophe, and the need to find a vision of
hope, turned Sitwell's thoughts in less ironic directions. Hersey had
written that, only a few weeks after the explosion,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Over everything&#8212;up through the wreckage of the city, in gutters,
along the riverbanks, tangled among tiles and tin roofing, climbing
on charred tree trunks&#8212;was a blanket of fresh, vivid, lush,
optimistic green; the verdancy rose even from the foundations of ruined
houses. Weeds already hid the ashes, and wild flowers were in bloom
among the city's bones. The bomb had not only left the underground
organs of plants intact; it had stimulated them. Everywhere were bluets
and Spanish bayonets, goosefoot, morning glories and day lilies, the
hairy-fruited bean, purslane and clotbur and sesame and panic grass and
feverfew. Especially in a circle at the center, sickle senna grew in
extraordinary regeneration, not only standing among the charred remnants
of the same plant but pushing up in new places, among bricks and through
cracks in the asphalt. It actually seemed as if a load of sickle-senna
seed had been dropped along with the bomb. [<i>H,</i> 91]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
One might recall Oken's tripartite understanding of plant life
that Sitwell had carefully noted: "Root and stem are the water- and
earth-plant, the leaf is the air-plant, the flower is the light- or
rather fire-plant" in relationship to Hersey's explanation of the sudden
profusion of plant life (<i>EP,</i> 229). If the false sun of the bomb
had murdered the natural sun and destroyed everything above the surface,
it had only destroyed part of the plant life, and nature is resilient.

<p>
Press accounts of the phenomena related to the nuclear explosion
suggested a catastrophe with biblical resonances. Hersey's portrayal of
the aftermath of the bomb included vortexes of fire, whirlwinds, thunder,
and even mysterious rains:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Houses nearby were burning, and when huge drops of water the size of
marbles began to fall, he half thought that they must be coming from
the hoses of firemen ting the blazes. (They were actually drops
of condensed moisture falling from the turbulent tower of dust, heat,
and fission fragments that had already risen miles into the sky above
Hiroshima). [<i>H,</i> 25]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In stanzas twenty-one through twenty-four, Sitwell provides an account
of the cataclysm which owes much to Thomas Burnet, the private chaplain
of King William III.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 Between 1680 and 1691, Burnet published (originally in Latin and then
 in English translation) the four books of <i>Telluris Theoria Sacra,
 or The Sacred Theory of the Earth.</i> The first book explores the
 deluge, the second the paradise that preceded it, the third the future
 conflagration of the world, and the fourth the paradise to come.

<p>
Though many scientists (including Lyell), made Burnet out to be a medieval
fundamentalist, he was a cutting edge scientist of his day.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 He argued in his preface that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
'Tis a dangerous thing to engage the authority of Scripture in disputes
against the Natural World in opposition to Reason; lest Time, which
brings all things to light, should discover

<b></b>

that to be evidently false which we had made Scripture to
assert. . . . We are not to suppose that any truth concerning the Natural
World can be an Enemy of Religion; for Truth cannot be an Enemy of
Truth, God is not divided against himself; therefore we ought not upon
that account to condemn or censure what we have not examined or cannot
disprove; as those that are of this narrow Spirit we are speaking of,
are very apt to do.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As Stephen Jay Gould puts it, "Burnet's basic position has been advanced
by nearly every theistic scientist since the Newtonian revolution:
God made it right the first time. He ordained the laws of nature to
yield an appropriate history; he needn't intervene later to patch
and fix an imperfect cosmos by miraculous alteration of his own laws"
(<i>TA,</i> 29).

<p>
For Burnet, then, science is based upon reason and the observation
of a world ruled by unchanging natural laws. Gould notes that "Burnet
viewed the flood as central to his methodological program. <i>The Sacred
Theory,</i> therefore, does not proceed chronologically, but moves from
deluge to preceding paradise, for Burnet held that if he could find a
rational explanation for this most cataclysmic and difficult event, his
method would surely encompass all history" (<i>TA,</i> 31). So Burnet
calculates the volume of the ocean and finds that rain itself could not
account for a flood of the magnitude described in the Bible. Instead,
he imagines a perfect earth with a smooth surface and no oceans, but
with a layer of subterranean ocean under a thin mantle. The mountains
and the oceans we see today are a result of ruin and disorder, as the
mantle collapses, dropping the land mass into water, causing the flood and
the disarray of current topography (<i>TE,</i> 1:140-5). Burnet's book,
like Oken's centuries later, explains the unity of all aspects of nature
and humanity. His theory of creation and destruction accounts for plants
and animals, the modes of human society, geographical and mineralogical
features, and the influence of celestial objects. Even the seasons are
seen as a post-Flood phenomena, as the earth's axis of rotation did not
tilt until the catastrophe. In Burnet's case, unity results from a divine
plan that is encoded into the natural laws that drive history.

<p>
But from the descriptions of the terrors of the rains and floods, Burnet
turns to the even more horrifying descriptions of the conflagration,
which he believes will be ignited by natural causes, such as volcanos and
a long drought. Eventually even the soil melts and rock burns: "there is
no terrestrial Body that does not finally yield to the force of fire,
and may either be converted into flame, incorporated in fire, or into
a liquor more ardent than either of them" (<i>TE,</i> 3:46). Moreover,
"the whole exteriour region of the Earth, to the depth of the deepest
part of the sea, will suffer in this fire; and suffer to that degree,
as to be melted down, and the frame of it dissolved . . . there will
be a sort of liquefaction and dissolution; It will become a molten sea
mingled with fire" (<i>TE,</i> 3:53).

<p>
Sitwell's language and imagery in stanzas twenty-two and twenty-three of
"Shadow" ("The violence of torrents, cataracts, maelstroms, rains / That
went before the Flood," "the forked lightnings of the gold / From the
split mountains," "Amid those terrible rains") seem based upon Burnet's
depiction of the deluge (<i>CP,</i> 369). They are perhaps also based upon
a passage from Burnet concerning the conflagration: "Lastly the Lightnings

<b></b>

of the Air, and the flaming streams of the melting skies, will mingle and
joyn with these burnings of the Earth" (<i>TE,</i> 3:84). His influence
continues in stanza twenty-four:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The gulf that was torn across the world seemed as if the beds of all
the Oceans
<br />
Were emptied. . . . . Naked, and gaping at what had once been the Sun,
<br />
Like the mouth of the Universal Famine,
<br />
It stretched its jaws from one end of the Earth to the other. [<i>CP,</i>
369]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Even more specifically, these lines suggest a passage in Burnet's third
volume that seems appropriate to the nuclear fire at Hiroshima that
melted even the sand beneath it. Burnet argues that the conflagration
will entirely destroy the surface of the earth, not just scorch it:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Furthermore, the Renovation of the World, or The New Heavens and New
Earth, which S. Peter, out of the prophets, tells us shall spring out of
these that are burned and dissolved, do suppose this Earth reduc'd into
a fluid Chaos, that it may lay a foundation for a second world. If you
take such a skeleton of an Earth, as your scorching Fire would leave
behind it; where the flesh is torn from the bones, and the Rocks and
Mountains stand naked and staring upon you; the sea, half empty, gaping
at the Sun, and the cities all in ruins and in rubbish; How would you
raise a New World from this? [<i>TE,</i> 3:81]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, Sitwell chooses imagery from the <i>wrong</i> version&#8212;the
scorched-earth version&#8212;of the conflagration, rather than the
complete annihilation and liquefaction that Burnet predicts. Why?

<p>
Sitwell chooses the scorched-earth imagery because the nuclear
conflagration is <i>man made,</i> not the judgment of God written into
the natural laws and history of the planet. The nuclear fires will leave
the imperfections of the world. The earth will recover from destruction
caused by human degradation. It is <i>this</i> world that concerns
Sitwell, and not a future paradise that Burnet predicts after the world
cools and reforms. Though Burnet gives Sitwell a way of imagining an
earth in the throes of catastrophe, she ultimately resists his vision
of complete destruction. The scientific discourses that dominate the
rest of the poem are those of healing and alchemy&#8212;of Paracelsus.

<p>
Sitwell possessed a copy of <i>The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of
Aureolus Philippus Theophrastus Bombast, of Hohenheim, called Paracelsus
the Great</i> translated by Arthur Edward Waite . Like her copy
of Oken, she read it carefully, listing many passages in the front.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Her notebook drafts of the poem (and the drafts of her notes to the
 poem, which she also published) reveal that the writings of this Swiss
 alchemist, physician, astronomer, and general scientific theorist
 pervade the last half of "Shadow." Sitwell's search for a unifying
 science led her through Lyell, Haeckel, Oken, and Burnet, but it found
 its logical conclusion in the work of Paracelsus. Tropes of alchemy had
 been used to describe atomic physics in the early twentieth century,
 and Sitwell focused much of the second half of "Shadow" on recovering
 a different

<b></b>

sense of alchemy: moving away from the simple transmutation of elements,
she envisioned an alchemy that would reintegrate the sciences, creating
organic and inorganic unity in twentieth-century physics. Paracelsus
represented a kind of cosmological and scientific view that Sitwell
advocated as a response to a nuclear holocaust caused by the dissociation
of the sciences. As Webster explains:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As far as Paracelsus was concerned, man and the cosmos were analogues
which were inseparably linked. The study of man the microcosm was
unthinkable without an appreciation of his place in the physical and
spiritual macrocosm. What Paracelsus termed 'astronomy' always found a
central place in his accounts of his medical system. . . . Thus, although
Paracelsus regarded his primary practical goal as the reform of medicine,
his religious standpoint, repeated use of the microcosm-macrocosm analogy,
and recognition of the powerful effects of the celestial environment on
man, constantly threw him back into the fields of cosmology and cosmogony.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Transmutation and alchemy in the atomic age had led to the bomb, and gold
represented the nationalistic avarice and greed that caused world war
and conflagration and was embodied by Dives. But Paracelsus's alchemy,
which explored the interrelationships of life and physics and the healing
power of gold over the physical decay of leprosy (again, a corollary to
radiation sickness and cancer), could suggest an alternative vision of the
sciences as healing and as drawing knowledge together into a benign unity.

<p>
Sitwell weaves Paracelsian thinking into the poem as she intentionally
conflates the stories of the two different Lazaruses in the
Bible&#8212;Lazarus, brother of Martha and Mary of Bethania, whom Jesus
raises from the dead (John 11: 41-4), and Lazarus the beggar who is
spurned by the rich man known as Dives in the Middle Ages (Luke 16:
19-31). After the stanzas invoking Burnet's description of the flood
and the conflagration, Sitwell turns to the first Lazarus:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And in that hollow lay the body of our brother
<br />
Lazarus, upheaved from the world's tomb.
<br />
He lay in that great Death like the gold in the husk
<br />
Of the world . . . And round him, like spent lightnings, lay the
Ore&#8212;
<br />
The balm for the world's sore.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And the gold lay in its husk of rough earth like the core
<br />
In the furred almond, the chestnut in its prickly
<br />
Bark, the walnut in a husk green and bitter.
<br />
Then to that hollow sea
<br />
The civilization of the Maimed, and, too, Life's lepers, came
<br />
As once to Christ near the Sea of Galilee. [<i>CP,</i> 369-70]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In John, Lazarus is resurrected by Jesus, but Sitwell also introduces
the other Lazarus. In Luke, Lazarus is a beggar with a horrible skin
disease that has long been assumed to be leprosy. He begs for crumbs at
the table of Dives, the rich man, but is spurned and is left to the dogs
at the gate. When both men die, Lazarus is taken to a heavenly

<b></b>

banquet, while Dives from the grave wishes Lazarus could bring him
even a drop of water. Though willing, Lazarus is not allowed to offer
relief. However, Sitwell's specific imagery of Lazarus lying "like gold
in the husk / Of the world . . . And round him, like spent lightnings,
lay the Ore&#8212; / The balm for the world's sore" is not from the
Bible, but rather from the connection she makes over the next several
stanzas to Paracelsus's writings, and, in particular, his discussions
of gold as a cure for leprosy. The plant imagery (almonds, chestnuts,
and walnuts) in stanza twenty-six is also from Paracelsus.

<p>
Sitwell was clearly fascinated by the parallel between the leprosy
that Paracelsus sought to cure and the radiation sickness&#8212;and,
more metaphorically, the moral sickness&#8212;associated with the
atomic bomb. The parallel she develops between these illnesses
becomes part of her poetic argument about the sciences. In the
second volume of <i>Hermetic Medicine and Hermetic Philosophy,</i> in
<i>The Archidoxies,</i> Paracelsus defines what he means by the word
"quintessence":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The quintessence, then, is a certain matter extracted from all things
which Nature has produced, and from everything which has life corporeally
in itself, a matter most subtly purged of all impurities and mortality,
and separated from all the elements. From this it is evident that the
quintessence is, so to say, a nature, a force, a virtue, and a medicine,
once, indeed shut up within things, but now free from any domicile and
from all outward incorporation. [<i>HA,</i> 2:22]
<!--_/extract-->

He argues that "The quintessence of gold corresponds with fire" and,
indeed, with the Sun (<i>HA,</i> 2:23). In passages to which Sitwell
refers in her published notes in the <i>Collected Poems,</i> Paracelsus
believed that the quintessence of gold, not just gold itself, could
cure a leprous body. Her note to verse twenty-nine appears as: "'Also
we must say that this or that is a disease of Gold, and not that it is
leprosy.'&#8212;<i>Paracelsus</i>, Appendix I, Chapter VI."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 The note to verses thirty-one through thirty-four includes: "'Gold is
 the most noble of all, the most precious and primary metal. . . . And
 we are not prepared to deny that leprosy, in all its forms, can be
 thereby removed from the human frame.'&#8212;<i>Paracelsus.</i> These
 verses also contain references to Hermetic Writings" (<i>CP,</i> 428).

<p>
Sitwell was attracted to the notion of quintessence of gold curing leprosy
because it could serve as a commentary on atomic theory. According to
the theory that developed the bomb, elements do each have something more
"elemental" than their humanly tangible form. Uranium, like gold in
Paracelsus's writings, can be touched and apprehended by human beings,
but through a kind of alchemy, its inner "being" can release great
energy. However, this energy is used entirely for destruction, and it
is motivated by greed, symbolized by the very gold that heals leprosy
(and heals the composite Lazarus in Sitwell's poem). Of course, Sitwell
is not suggesting that Paracelsus understood atomic physics and sought
nuclear fission. Rather, she saw Paracelsus's version of "atomic fission"
as setting a proper course for science. The pure hidden forces of the
elements of the universe, in the hands of the right scientist, are a
source for the healing of bodies, not a cause of their illness. Illness
becomes a kind of metaphor for twentieth-century nuclear physics.

<b></b>

<p>
Moreover, Paracelsus's understanding of the hidden properties of elements
was tied into a much larger sense of the relationship between organic and
inorganic (which lived on, to some extent, in the search for unities in
Burnet, Oken, and Haeckel). The pamphlet version of "Shadow" included,
beyond the two notes quoted above, several notes that were not reprinted
in the <i>Collected Poems</i>:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
<i>Page 14, last verse.</i> "Some of the visible trees produce their
fruits covered up, for instance, chestnuts under a prickly bark, walnuts
under one that is green and bitter, and under this again a bitter
membrane, and then at last the kernel. So it happens in minerals, the
kernels of which, that is to say, the metals are separated just like
those others by barks."

<p>
Parcelsus's similes in these passages&#8212;minerals and metals are like
the kernels of nuts; gold "grows" like a tree or like a rose from a rose
seed; gold restores the body like a honeycomb purged of its honey and
wax&#8212;are verbally rich, but they are also much more than simply
similes. The rative language reinforces a major argument that runs
through Paracelsus's writings: the inorganic and organic world are
intimately tied together.

<p>
Indeed, an early draft of stanzas twenty-five and twenty-six makes more
explicit the connection between Lazarus, who "lay in that great Death
like the gold in the husk," and the passage about the unlocking of life
and hidden potentials, where the gold "in its husk of rough earth" is
juxtaposed with the nutritive nuts in their green bitter husks (<i>CP,</i>
369). In the draft, which appears in an undated letter the poet sent to
John Lehmann, Sitwell included both ideas in the same stanza:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And in that hollow lay the body of our brother
<br />
Lazarus, heaved from the world's tomb; and round him the gold
<br />
Lay in the husk, as the chestnut in the prickly
<br />
Bark, the walnut under one that is green and bitter
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The same draft version makes stanza twenty-seven more explicitly
Paracelsian. The published version tells that "Life's lepers, came /
As once to Christ near the Sea of

<b></b>

Galilee" (<i>CP,</i> 370). The draft in the letter reads: "The cripples,
the maimed, the blind of life were brought&#8212; / Down to that Place
of Gold / As once to Christ near the Sea of Galilee."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
Likewise, the early draft of stanza thirty-three connects the organic and
the inorganic. In this case, the organic is connected to the catastrophe
of flood and nuclear conflagration and is made more explicitly Paracelsian
with the inclusion of an image of a honeycomb:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
He did not look at us:
<br />
He said "What was spilt still surges like the Flood.
<br />
But Gold shall be the Blood
<br />
of the World . . . Brute gold condensed to the primal essence
<br />
Has the texture, smell, warmth, colour of Blood. Will it shape
<br />
Again the Shadow of Man? At least it will take
<br />
From what roots of life are left the symptoms of the leper&#8212;
<br />
And make the body sharp as the honeycomb. . . ." [<i>CP</i>, 370]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This early draft and the many drafts in the notebooks (too numerous to
quote here) tinkered with the phrasing, sometimes drawing more heavily
on Paracelsus's writings on leprosy and the quintessence of gold, and
healing plants and gems. At other times, Sitwell moved closer to the
synthesis of those ideas with the final vision of the poem, which brings
Dives and Cain into a composite picture of betrayal and greed.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
Sitwell ended "Shadow" with a religious sense of the collective guilt
of a culture that murdered so many thousands at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
noting that "those ashes that were men / Will rise again / To be our Fires
upon the Judgment Day!" (<i>CP,</i> 372). Yet the scientific discourse
of healing with alchemy and medicine took precedence in the phrase
with which she summarized the poem: "In this poem I show the sufferers
from the disease hoping to cure themselves by means of some universal
application of a medicine made [from] the diseases' quintessence, used
as a prophylactic" (<i>N,</i> 62). The poem powerfully suggests that a
response to the biological crisis that atomic science had precipitated
by creating the bomb could only be met by a concerted and healing
reintegration of the sciences into an ethical whole, a unity with roots
that Sitwell could trace from the Romantic science of Oken and Haeckel
back to the alchemy of Paracelsus.

Edith Sitwell read John Hersey's <i>Hiroshima</i> (1946, originally
published in the <i>New Yorker</i>) and copied passages from Hersey and
from bomb reportage in the <i>Daily Mail,Daily Express,Scottish Sunday
Express,</i> and other newspapers. John Langdon Davies's article,
"Atom Bombs: Some Dread New Facts" (<i>Daily Mail,</i> 2 September
1946), conjured nightmarish visions that Sitwell copied into her undated
notebook 78 of "subhuman" Japanese babies born centuries in the future
due to radiation damage. Davies also described a radioactive dust
dropped from planes onto unsuspecting towns at night to create "hidden
biological results" and expressed the fear that "200 aeroplanes each
with an atomic bomb could sterilise or cause chromosome injury to the
entire population of Britain." The section called "Three Poems of the
Atomic Age" first appeared in Edith Sitwell, <i>The Song of the Cold</i>
(New York: Vanguard, 1948).

<p>
<a name="FOOT4" href="#REF4">4</a>.
Sitwell was on the road to a conversion to Roman Catholicism&#8212;she
was received into the church in 1955&#8212;and had addressed religious
issues fairly directly in her poetry from the 1940s, and even, in a less
sustained way, as far back as <i>Gold Coast Customs</i> . Scholars
have not engaged with Sitwell's later poetry to the extent that they
have with, for example, <i>Fa&ccedil;ade</i> . The flurry of
work on "Three Poems of the Atomic Age" that appeared in the 1960s and
1970s largely emerged from Catholic journals and book series by scholars
explicating Sitwell's religious vision. See, for example: Ralph J. Mills,
Jr., <i>Edith Sitwell: A Critical Essay</i> (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William
B. Eerdmans: 1966), published as part of the "Contemporary Writers in
Christian Perspective" series; publications by Sister M. Jeremy and John
Ower in <i>Renascence,</i> which was published "by the Catholic Renascence
Society, Inc., to promote the study of values in literature"; and articles
appearing in religion-oriented journals such as <i>The Personalist</i>
and the <i>American Benedictine Review.</i> John Ower published three
essays on Sitwell during the period, and claimed her as a Catholic
thinker well before her conversion: "Edith Sitwell was received into
the Roman Catholic Church in 1955, but her poetry reflects Christian
and specifically Catholic ideas well before that date." See John Ower,
"Edith Sitwell and the Atomic Bomb," <i>American Benedictine Review</i> 27
: 428, n. 2; hereafter abbreviated as "ES." Even recent work still
focuses primarily on the religious vision without exploring any of the
scientific contexts of the poem. See, for example, Pamela Slateliggett,
"The Vision of Edith Sitwell: Prophecy and Sensation in Her World War
II Poetry," <i>Language and Literature</i> 22 : 93-102.

<p>
<a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>.
Ower offers the most thorough religious criticisms, and his careful
exploration of the Biblical images and concepts from "Salvation
History" provide us with a theologically sophisticated account of
Sitwell's interpretation of the atomic holocaust. He suggests that
Sitwell's "vision of Fall and Redemption" was based on a dynamic
between "alienation" and "atonement," which he calls the "matrix of
reconciliation" ("ES," 427). For instance, Ower reads the ice age imagery
and the "great oscillations / Of temperature" in the poem as symbols of
the disjunction between the mind and instincts and emotions, which he
suggests Sitwell sees as an aspect of the Fall ("ES," 428, n. 3). He reads
the passages about intense cold as symbolizing the "loveless isolation"
of the mind and an ironic parody of divine creation <i>ex nihilo</i>,
without exploring their sources in scientific tracts that Sitwell cites
in her published notes to the poem. Two of the most important of these
are Charles Lyell's <i>Principles of Geology</i> (1830-33; Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1990), hereafter abbreviated as <i>PG</i>;
and Lorenz Oken's <i>Elements of Physiophilosophy,</i> trans. Alfred Tulk

Sitwell's word choice also recalls press accounts of the paradoxical
chill of radiation burn victims. In one poignant passage from Hersey's
<i>Hiroshima</i> a priest helps a woman with "huge, raw flash burns on her
body": "She began to shiver heavily, and again said it was cold. Father
Kleinsorge borrowed a blanket from someone nearby and wrapped her up,
but she shook more and more, and said again, 'I am so cold,' and then she
suddenly stopped shivering and was dead." John Hersey, <i>Hiroshima</i>

<p>
<a name="FOOT27" href="#REF27">27</a>.
There were certainly more recent challenges than <i>Naturphilosophie</i>
to mechanistic philosophies in the modernist period. For instance, it is
hard to imagine that Sitwell was unaware of the work of Henri Bergson and
the vitalist philosophy that was at its height from the late nineteenth
century through roughly the 1920s. See Sanford Schwartz, "Bergson and the
Politics of Vitalism," in <i>The Crisis in Modernism: Bergson and the
Vitalist Controversy,</i> ed. Frederick Burwick and Paul Douglass (New
York: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 277-305. I don't find direct
evidence that Bergsonianism played a role in Sitwell's thinking in the
1940s. Instead, it appears that Oken's attack on mechanistic sciences
and his highly idiosyncratic and imaginative attempt to weave together
a system that would unify biology, physics, geology, and virtually
all other sciences, captured Sitwell's fancy in a way that Bergson may
not have. Sitwell owned a copy of Bergson's <i>Creative Evolution</i>
, but her 1959 reprint was published well after the composition
of the bomb poems.

On the front leaf Sitwell noted 110 different pages, sometimes with
annotations, and she marked in the margins, sometimes with annotations,
188 separate propositions (the book was published in the form of
numbered propositions). However, two pairs of pages, 585-6 and 587-8,
were never cut, so she must not have read every page (these pages contain
descriptions of various categories of worms).

<p>
<a name="FOOT30" href="#REF30">30</a>.
Oken begins by making a number of claims about the mathematical nature
of the universe:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
2. The universe or world is the reality of mathematical ideas, or,
in simpler language, of mathematics.

<br />
3. Philosophy is the recognition of mathematical ideas as constituting the
world, or the repetition of the origin of the world in consciousness.
<br />
4., 5. Spirit is the motion of mathematical ideas. Nature, their
manifestation.
<br />
6. The philosophy of Spirit is the representation of the movements of ideas
in consciousness. [<i>EP,</i> 1]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
<a name="FOOT31" href="#REF31">31</a>.
Oken claims that "The law of causality is a law of polarity. Causality
is valid only in time, is only a series of numbers" (<i>EP,</i> 21).

<p>
<a name="FOOT32" href="#REF32">32</a>.
Sitwell's lines, "Then Time froze / To immobility and changed to
Space," while conjuring a sense of the response to the tragic news of
Hiroshima&#8212;time froze&#8212;probably owes more to Oken than to
popular readings of Einstein's connectedness of space and time.

<p>
<a name="FOOT33" href="#REF33">33</a>.
Oken asserted that "Animals are entire heavenly bodies, satellites or
moons, which circulate independently about the earth; all plants, on the
contrary, taken together are only equivalent to one heavenly body. An
animal is an infinity of plants" (<i>EP,</i> 207).

<p>
<a name="FOOT34" href="#REF34">34</a>.
<i>EP,</i> 322. Regarding polarization in plants, Oken notes: "The plant
may be characterized as organic water which is polarized upon two sides,
towards the earth and the air. The vegetable vesicle must therefore
maintain two poles" (<i>EP,</i> 206).

<p>
<a name="FOOT35" href="#REF35">35</a>.
In the first edition of "Shadow" (a 1947 pamphlet), Sitwell attributes
the first two lines of stanza twenty-five&#8212;"The gulf that was
torn across the world seemed as if the beds of all the Oceans / Were
emptied . . . Naked, and gaping at what once had been the Sun, / Lies
the mouth of the Universal Famine / It stretched its jaws from one end
of the Earth to the other"&#8212;to Bishop Burnet's <i>Theory of the
Earth.</i> In the later <i>Collected Poems</i> version of these notes,
she omits this attribution, instead citing <i>Theory of the Earth</i>
only for the first, second, and fourth lines of the twenty-third stanza:
"And with them, the forked lightnings of the gold / From the split
mountains, / Blasting their rivals, the young foolish wheat-ears /
Amid those terrible rains" (<i>CP,</i> 369).

<p>
<a name="FOOT36" href="#REF36">36</a>.
Stephen Jay Gould has written one of the most probing reassessments
of Burnet in recent years, arguing against a vision of history that
only considers the "progress" of science: "the rationale for such a
simplistic one-way flow from observation to theory has become entirely
bankrupt. . . . Scientists are human beings, immersed in culture,
and struggling with all the curious tools of inference that mind
permits&#8212;from metaphor and analogy to all the flights of fruitful
imagination that C. S. Pierce calls 'abduction.'" Stephen Jay Gould,
<i>Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle: Myth and Metaphor in the Discovery
of Geological Time</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,
1987), 6-7; hereafter abbreviated as <i>TA.</i> Gould explains that, in
this theory of history, "Thomas Burnet, villain by taint of theological
dogmatism, wrote his <i>Sacred Theory of the Earth</i> in the 1680s. The
first hero, James Hutton, worked exactly a century later, writing his
initial version of the <i>Theory of the Earth</i> in the 1780s. Charles
Lyell, second hero and codifier of modernity, then wrote his seminal
treatise, <i>Principles of Geology,</i> just fifty years later, in
the 1830s" (<i>TA,</i> 4). He points out that, by the early nineteenth
century, geologists like Lyell had come to ridicule Burnet's scientific
methods for their fancifulness, religious dogma, and lack of compelling
scientific evidence, yet Lyell's sense of "scientific history" is the
very kind against which Gould argues. Of Burnet's <i>Sacred Theory,</i>
Lyell wrote:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Even Milton had scarcely ventured in his poem to indulge his imagination
so freely in painting scenes of the Creation and Deluge, Paradise
and Chaos, as this writer, who set forth pretensions to profound
philosophy. He explained why the primeval earth enjoyed a perpetual spring

sun's rays," so that it burst, and thus the diluvial waters were let loose
from a supposed central abyss. Not satisfied with these themes, he derived
from the books of the inspired writers, and even from heathen authorities,
prophetic views of the future revolutions of the globe, gave a most
terrific description of the general conflagration, and proved that a new
heaven and a new earth will rise out of a <i>second chaos</i>&#8212;after
which will follow the blessed millennium. [<i>PG,</i> 1: 37-8; italics

So why would Sitwell include both Burnet and Lyell as building blocks for
the same poem? I would argue that her vision of the history of scientific
"progress" is more like Gould's than Lyell's. And, beyond even Gould's
understanding of the embeddedness of science in the cultural texture
of its day, Sitwell seems to have seen that the imaginative resources
of the past can be brought to bear upon the present to help revise
scientific emphasis.

Historians have recently redeemed Paracelsus from his reputation as
the last gasp of the Dark Ages and magic before true science began with
Newton and others. Andrew Weeks has explored Paracelsus's role in the
Protestant Reformation in <i>Paracelsus: Speculative Theory and the
Crisis of the Early Reformation</i> (Albany: State University of New
York Press, 1997). Charles Webster has shown that "the first major
confrontation of the Scientific Revolution was between Paracelsus and
Galen, rather than between Copernicus and Ptolemy." Charles Webster,
<i>From Paracelsus to Newton: Magic and the Making of Modern Science</i>
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), 3-4. Paracelsus can be
seen as a father of modern pharmacology, and Webster argues that even the
mechanical philosophy of the seventeenth century did not make Paracelsian
thought obsolete. Webster detects Paracelsus's influence on the Atomism of
Pierre Gassendi, the work of Francis Bacon, the chemistry of Robert Boyle,
and chemical therapy in the later seventeenth century. He argues that
the English physiology of Francis Glisson, John Mayow, and Thomas Willis
were all influenced by Paracelsus. Webster also notes that Newton had a
lively interest in magic and alchemy, possessing volumes by Paracelsus
in his enormous collection of alchemical works.

Webster, <i>From Paracelsus to Newton,</i> 4. Arthur Edward Waite, the
translator of the version of Paracelsus's writings that Sitwell used,
stridently emphasized the interconnectedness of all aspects of science
and religion in Paracelsus that Sitwell desired. In his preface, he
argued that:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
With Paracelsus the province of alchemy was not limited to the
transmutation of metals. It was, broadly speaking, the development of
hidden possibilities or virtues in any substance, whether by God, or
man, or Nature. Thus it included the philosophy of creation, and dealt
with the first matter as developed into the universe by Divine Power. It
included as the natural evolution which takes place round us, whether in
the formation of metals within the earth, or the formation of animals
in the matrix. Finally, it included the development by man's skill and
art of whatsoever was capable of improvement in the products of Nature.

(<i>HA,</i> 2:320).

This passage, which Sitwell copied out in notebook 62, is further
explained by the following passage in Paracelsus:



<blockquote>

There are some trees which bear their fruit, not nakedly, but under
mixed conditions. The chestnut, the nut, and other similar growths, have
a bark, thorny in appearance, and inside another, while, lastly a thin
skin encloses the kernel. So, in like manner, there are metals, also,
and minerals lying hid in flesh and skin, such as are the ore of iron,
the ore of silver, and so on. These have to be removed in order that,
after separation, the desired fruit may be extracted. [<i>HA,</i> 1:242]

Stanza thirty-seven in the <i>Collected Poems</i> includes: "But near
him a gold sound&#8212; / The voice of an unborn wheat-ear accusing
Dives&#8212; / Said, 'Soon I shall be more rare, more precious than gold"
(<i>CP,</i> 371). The draft version of these lines that appears in the
letter to Lehmann drew the use of wheat as a life-giving commodity
(subject to greed, but more necessary than gold) into the dialogue
with Paracelsus on leprosy: "But the unborn wheat-ear said 'When the
quintessence / Shall be extracted from the amber or from musk / There is
left only the husk- / A body that stinks and is dry as what was once the
gold swoln wheat-ear.'" In the published poem, Sitwell includes part of
this last line in stanza thirty-two, after describing Dives who is now,
in a turning of the tables, suffering from leprosy of the heart. In
stanza thirty-one, she writes: "Like a great ear of wheat that is swoln
with grain, / Then ruined by white rain, / He lay. . . . His hollow face,
dust white, was cowled with a hood of gold" (<i>CP,</i> 370).

Perhaps out of woman's contact with the advance movements of the
world there will in time arise a more honest and courageous womanhood,
devoid of petty shames, which shall be able and willing to contribute
to science intelligently the deepest complexities of woman's emotional
nature. . . . The book of the woman is yet to be written and it remains
for the woman to do it who is able and brave enough to strip herself
clean to the soul; to know herself and let herself be known.

The realities of women's sexual life have been greatly obscured by the
lack of any sexual vocabulary. While her brother has often learned
all the slang of the street before adolescence, the conventionally
"decently brought-up" girl, of the upper and middle classes, has no terms
to define many of her sensations and experiences. When she marries, or
meets her first lover, she learns a whole new language, and often this
language has been defiled in the mind of the man who teaches it to her,
long before they met.

<p>
The early years of modernism's development in England and America witness
a lively public debate about sex in which women play a leading role. As
the epigraphs from sex reformers Margaret Sanger and Stella Browne
suggest, modern women concur, despite other disagreements, that their
time has come to "speak out" about sex, to re-present female sexuality.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 The new science

<b></b>

of sexology is central in the debate: leading male sex reformers,
like Havelock Ellis, are sex scientists; leading female reformers,
like Sanger and Browne, adapt sexological arguments to their causes.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Yet as the quotations also indicate, these women understand well that
 language, as the scene and material of conceptual change, enables and
 constrains reform. They choose to speak women's sex, to (re)construct
 female sexuality for a new century through language, but the sexism
 inherent in available discourses of gender and sexuality necessarily
 conditions, limits, and problematizes their efforts. One goal of this
 essay is to understand better how writers like Sanger and Browne give
 voice to female sexuality using languages they perceive as fundamentally
 deformed by established sexual relations and social institutions.

<p>
At the moment this public debate on sex reaches a fevered pitch, World War
I significantly reconres sexual and power relations between women and
men (at least for a time), even as it reconres the various literary
movements and practices of the prewar avant-garde.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Two exemplary texts&#8212;<i>Love Songs to Joannes</i> (1915-17), a
 controversial work of avant-garde poetry by Mina Loy, and <i>Married
 Love</i> , a celebrated work of popular science by the birth
 control advocate Marie Stopes&#8212;illuminate how self-consciously
 modern female sex reformers respond to these wartime transformations
 while negotiating the complexities of speaking women's sex in the
 languages of the moment. My decision to consider as case studies a work
 of avant-garde lyric poetry and a work of popular science is intended to
 elucidate further the crucial role the discourses of lyric and science
 played in what Michel Foucault calls the "scheme for transforming sex
 into discourse," the "complex deployment for compelling sex to speak."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 At the start of the seventeenth century, Foucault argues, lyric

<b></b>

poetry becomes a leading genre for "the nearly infinite task of telling"
about sex (<i>HS,</i> 20). Later, in the nineteenth century, modern
medical science joins the process, principally, Foucault contends, through
a "biology of reproduction" and a "medicine of sex" (<i>HS,</i> 54). More
specifically, Loy's <i>Love Songs</i> and Stopes's <i>Married Love</i>
clarify how women's writing during the World War I, whether literary and
avant-garde or scientific and popular, articulates female sexuality by
mingling lexicons of science and literature, intellect and sentiment.

<p>
At first glance, however, these texts appear incompatible: <i>Love
Songs</i> is aggressively avant-garde poetry often interpreted to
express, as Carolyn Burke has pointed out, the radical aesthetic and
sexual doctrines of free verse and free love.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Written by a notorious "modern woman," the provocative <i>Love Songs</i>
 appears in Alfred Kreymborg's avant-garde little magazine <i>Others</i>,
 which was conceived of as a more radical alternative to Harriet
 Monroe's <i>Poetry</i>. Initially decried and derided as degenerate
 and pornographic, <i>Love Songs</i> is deemed "erotic and erratic"
 (<i>New York Sun,</i> 21 August 1915), "swill poetry," and even
 "Hoggerel" (<i>New York Tribune,</i> 3 July 1915).
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
<i>Married Love,</i> in contrast, is a self-consciously popular marriage
manual written in a sentimental "poetical-soulful style" that expresses
aggressively normative conceptions of bourgeois respectability.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Authored by a respected paleobotanist, <i>Married Love</i> appears
 in wartime London to broad approval: in the first two weeks after
 publication, it sells two thousand copies; during the next nine years
 it is reprinted in England eighteen

<b></b>

times; within the next two decades readers buy over a million copies
(<i>SP,</i> 188; "FR," 137; <i>WI,</i> 366-7).
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Recent scholars judge it "one of the first modern bestsellers,"
 a "literary landmark," and "the most-read book on sex of its
 time&#8212;perhaps of any time."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Despite these differences, <i>Love Songs</i> and <i>Married Love</i>
 actively participate in the spirited sex reform debates of the time.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 They "speak out" about the facts of sex, especially woman's; they
 link "contradictory strands" of the prewar sex reform debate; and as
 modernist texts they develop new idioms of female sexual experience
 by adapting established vocabularies, conjoining in different ways
 scientific and literary language.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Both texts should therefore be understood as important artifacts of
 modernism that participate in the effort to liberate sexual language
 from the allegedly repressive social and linguistic regimes of
 Victorianism.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
The texts of Stopes and Loy are also noteworthy as feminist political
documents because they move beyond the polarized arguments of British
feminism in the immediate prewar period. Legislative efforts to respond
to a perceived rise in child prostitution and the forced traffic in young
girls on the continent, the so-called white slave trade, provoked a heated
debate among feminists (<i>SP,</i> 86; <i>DS,</i> 126-7). Advocates for
"social purity," led by radical suffragettes like Christabel Pankhurst,
stressed women's "celibacy, evolutionary superiority and the power
of human love" (<i>DS,</i> 138). As Kathlyn Oliver, a self-proclaimed
"suffragist" and "feminist" argued in a 1912 propurity letter to the
<i>Freewoman</i>,

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
in sex matters it is surely indisputable that we women are miles above
and beyond men. Some men would have us believe that their laxity in
this matter and their inability or lack of desire to restrain or control
their lower appetite is a sign of their superiority, but to me it only
proves that . . . they have still a long way to go before they are really
emancipated and evolved from the lower animal. But, alas! they hug the
chains which bind them.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But as social purity supporters imagined themselves to have evolved beyond
the constraints of animal instinct, libertarian advocates of a "'new
morality' of free sexual unions," such as Stella Browne, Dora Marsden,
and Rebecca West, countered that the "White Slave Act," would restrict
"individual liberty and encourage . . . prudish self-satisfaction"
(<i>DS,</i> 146). As Browne argued in a 1915 lecture to the reformist
Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, "These cold women generally have
a perfect mania for <i>prohibition</i> as a solution for all ills. But
surely, we do not want the new world to be built up only of women who have
long ago forgotten what sex means, or who have never experienced strong
sexual emotions, and regard them as a sign of grossness or decadence."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 If Browne refutes Oliver's implication that sexuality is only a
 "lower appetite" with a defense of female sexuality we might approve,
 she also exploits the antifeminist stereotype of the spinster, which
 was deployed effectively during the period to thwart feminist efforts
 of political reform.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 The quotations of Oliver and Browne also make clear how polarized
 British feminist discourse had become just before World

<b></b>

War I. Loy's and Stopes's texts, by bringing together arguments of social
purity and free love, resist certain oppositions of the debate. Both
writers reform these arguments by altering the languages in which they
were framed. Their efforts to move beyond the oppositions of purity and
free love by combining strands of both are enacted formally in attempts to
unite antagonistic, and differently gendered, vocabularies of sentimental
love and rationalist science. In pursuing this formal strategy, Loy's
<i>Love Songs</i> and Stopes's <i>Married Love</i> make the discourses
of literature and science work intimately together. Their efforts to
modernize gender by rewriting sex illuminate an important moment in
twentieth-century culture.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Sentimental Science, Scientific Love
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
As a work of popular science, <i>Married Love</i> relies more heavily on
the lexicons of sex science and formally enacts its ideological work more
straightforwardly than <i>Love Songs</i>. It sexes middle-class women,
marriage, and love by marrying a "feminine" literary language to a
"masculine" technical language. The text begins in a familiar idiom of
sentimental spiritualism, idealizing love as the union of "hearts" and
"souls" (<i>WI,</i> 367-8):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every heart desires a mate. For some reason beyond our comprehension,
nature has so created us that we are incomplete in ourselves; neither
man nor woman singly can know the joy of the performance of all the
human functions; neither man nor woman singly can create another human
being. This fact, which is expressed in our outward divergencies of form,
influences and colours the whole of our lives; and there is nothing for
which the innermost spirit of one and all so yearns as for a sense of
union with another soul, and the perfecting of oneself which such union
brings. [<i>ML,</i> 39]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Couched in metaphor and the vocabularies of lyric and religion, the
passage leaves almost unrecognizable the "human functions" and "outward
divergencies of form" it puts at the center of this soulful union. Stopes
makes sexual intercourse a metaphor for spiritual intercourse, yet so
emphasizes the tenor that it nearly occludes the vehicle. She maintains
this style for four chapters, keeping the facts of sex at arm's length,
justifying sexual relations by spiritualizing and aestheticizing them.

<p>
Having so contextualized these "human functions," Stopes prepares to
examine the "physiology of our most profoundly disturbing functions" by
adopting the rhetoric of the scientist as a shield against the dangers
of eroticism and pornography: "An impersonal and scientific knowledge
of the structure of our bodies is the surest safeguard against prurient
curiosity and lascivious gloating" (<i>ML,</i> 79, 80). This metaphoric
construction of scientific knowledge as aesthetic and moral prophylactic
is revealing because it anticipates formally Stopes's defense, in
<i>Married Love</i> and especially its sequel <i>Wise Parenthood</i>
, of birth control as a necessary method for achieving her ideal of
mated hearts. It also works ironically to emphasize the gendered power
inequities that thwarted feminist efforts to popularize birth control:
a rise in venereal infections among British soldiers had recently led
the government to distribute condoms and promote their use, arguably
legitimating contraception more significantly than

<b></b>

had years of feminist agitation (<i>SP,</i> 187-8).
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 In this context, Stopes's modulation from a "feminine" language of
 metaphor and sentiment to a "masculine" language of facts and reason
 appears to be a strategic, even subversive, effort to authorize
 autonomous female sexuality by using a vocabulary of male authority:
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
What actually happens in an act of union should be known. After the
preliminaries have mutually roused the pair, the stimulated penis,
enlarged and stiffened, is pressed into the woman's vagina. Ordinarily
when a woman is not stimulated, the walls of this canal, as well as
the exterior lips of soft tissue surrounding it, are dry and rather
crinkled, and the vaginal opening is smaller than the man's extended
penis. But when the woman is what is physiologically called tumescent
(that is, when she is ready for union and has been profoundly stirred)
these parts are flushed by the internal blood supply and to some extent
are turgid like those of the man, while a secretion of mucus lubricates
the channel of the vagina. . . . It can therefore be readily imagined
that when the man tries to enter a woman whom he has <i>not</i> wooed to
the point of stimulating her natural physical reactions of preparation,
he is endeavouring to force his entry through a dry-walled opening
too small for it. He may thus cause the woman actual pain, apart from
the mental revolt and loathing she is likely to feel for a man who so
regardlessly uses her. [<i>ML,</i> 80-1; italics in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage begins in the mode of sex science, describing in a
terminology of impersonal observation the physical facts of intercourse,
what Stopes calls "the truths of sex."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 But by the passage's closing sentences, this "scientific" description
 of intercourse has become not merely a call for foreplay, but also a
 pointed condemnation of rape. While Stopes aims to provide readers
 with factual knowledge about sex acts, she also seeks to liberate
 female sexual pleasure and regulate male sexual domination. She makes
 male science work prophylactically to protect women from the "pain"
 and the "mental revolt and loathing" to which unregulated male desire
 has subjected them.

<p>
Stopes's unadorned scopic language works in other ways to promote and
control sexual intercourse. Penises, vaginas, blood, and mucus are
essential parts of love making, <i>Married Love</i> insists, but they
must be handled properly. Her discussion of orgasm clarifies further the
reformist and regulatory drives animating her "impersonal and scientific"
descriptions of sex (<i>ML,</i> 80):



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
When the two have met and united, the usual result is that, after a longer
or shorter interval, the man's mental and physical stimulation reaches a
climax in sensory intoxication and in the ejaculation of semen. When the
two are perfectly adjusted, the woman simultaneously reaches the crisis of
nervous and muscular reactions very similar to his. This mutual orgasm is
extremely important, but in many cases the man's climax comes so swiftly
that the woman's reactions are not nearly ready, and she is left without
it. . . . [I]t is hardly an exaggeration to say that 70 or 80 per cent
of our married women (in the middle classes) are deprived of the full
orgasm through the excessive speed of the husband's reactions. . . . So
deep-seated, so profound, are woman's complex sex-instincts as well as
her organs, that in rousing them the man is rousing her whole body and
soul. And this takes time. [<i>ML,</i> 83]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The stress on mutual orgasm as the legitimating principle of coitus
reveals Stopes's interest in recasting a free love paradigm of mutually
pleasurable sex in terms more

<b></b>

palatable to a substantial, middle-class audience (<i>SP,</i> 191). At the
same time, her satiric rebuke of English men for what she elsewhere calls
their "prevalent failure . . . to effect orgasms for their wives at each
congress" plays on cultural ideals of masculine power (<i>ML,</i> 88). At
a time when masculinity is literally under siege in the trenches, she
exploits male insecurity to validate female desire. Stopes's paradoxical
reliance on ideals of masculinity to write female sexuality into popular
language helps clarify the structural sexism of British public discourse
and reveals her complex manipulations of that discourse to open a space
for female sexuality.

<p>
Yet despite Stopes's use of a rhetoric of scientific objectivity, her
text often maintains a peculiar reticence about crucial aspects of the
sexual relations it seeks to illuminate, especially the "preliminaries"
she repeatedly identifies as essential for realizing the ideal sexual
and spiritual union. While <i>Married Love</i> advises emphatically
that a man "<i>must woo</i>" his wife "<i>before every separate act of
coitus,</i>" Stopes rarely discusses the specific techniques required to
"profoundly stir" "woman's complex sex-instincts" (<i>ML,</i> 81; italics
in original). Stopes's refusal to be explicit about the facts of foreplay,
despite her stress on orgasm as the climax of "perfectly adjusted" sex,
arguably aggravates the problems of women's sexual deprivation, coercion,
and dissatisfaction that the text claims to redress. Moreover, as Geppert
has emphasized, her ideal union overlooks forms of sexual activity
that are not heterosexual or genitally or orgasmically centered ("MBS,"
431). And her parenthetical proviso that the widespread deprivation of
orgasm occurs "in middle class women" confirms the class boundaries and
prejudices of <i>Married Love.</i>
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 It is not surprising, then, that Stopes has been read as, in effect,
 reproducing British patriarchy by rehabilitating Victorian codes of
 respectability and buttressing sexist, classist, and heteronormative
 ideals and institutions.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
That <i>Married Love</i> does not transcend the conceptual limitations of
its moment is of less significance, I think, than its effort to fashion
a language of female sexuality out of the gendered discourses at hand
(cf. "FR," 146; "MBS," 480). We have seen how Stopes creates a new
conception and idiom of women's sex by wedding previously incompatible
ideas and lexicons. <i>Married Love</i> makes free love's assertion of
autonomous female sexuality and advocacy of birth control compatible
with social purity's normalizing moralism and defense of bourgeois
heterosexual marriage by joining a "female" language of sentimental
spiritualism to a "male" language of scientific rationality, marrying
metaphoric descriptions of hearts and souls to graphic descriptions of
vaginas and penises. We can gauge the fruitfulness of these efforts
by looking at the text's popularity with bourgeois and working class
readers, its effectiveness in giving voice to an autonomous middle-class
female sexuality, and its success in legitimating and popularizing birth
control in Britain (<i>SP,</i> 188; "FR," 140). Of greater importance
for our argument are the ways Stopes represents this ideological and
formal union as both biologically <i>and</i> aesthetically fruitful:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the complete act of union is a triple consummation. It symbolizes, and at
the same time actually enhances, the spiritual union; there are a myriad
subtleties of soul-structures which are compounded in this alchemy. At
the same time the act gives the most intense physical pleasure and
benefit which the body can experience, and it is a <i>mutual</i>, not a

<b></b>

selfish, pleasure and profit, more calculated than anything else to draw
out an unspeakable tenderness and understanding in both partakers of this
sacrament; while, thirdly, it is the act which gives rise to a new life
by rendering possible the fusion of one of the innumerable male sperms
with the female egg-cell. [<i>ML,</i> 84]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike pornographic representations of coitus, popularly held to
breed nonproductive autoeroticism and eventual degeneracy, Stopes's
representations of the "supreme human art, the art of love" are richly
productive (<i>ML,</i> 31). <i>Married Love</i> makes sexual intercourse
fruitful by making it pleasurable, spiritual, and reproductive. Properly
practiced, coitus generates not only children (though they are crucial),
but also love between the married couple and the individual spouse's
self-love. The passage enacts this productivity formally through its
integration of previously contradictory lexicons: in this "fusion,"
spiritual unions, soul-structures, and sacraments "are compounded"
with intense physical pleasure, male sperms, and female egg-cells.

<p>
From certain points of view, the achievement of <i>Married Love</i>
can appear limited. Its sentimentality and popular success can be
seen as aesthetic failings, just as its neglect of nonreproductive,
heterosexual, and working-class sexualities can be seen as political
failings. Yet <i>Married Love</i> can also be understood to articulate
and defend a kind of modernism. For Stopes's text shares with those of
writers such as D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Loy not
only the conviction that changes in language can affect changes in sexual
relations, but also, though to a lesser extent, the formal juxtaposition
of different lexicons and linguistic registers. By wedding the politics of
free love and social purity and the languages of sentiment and science,
<i>Married Love</i> pursues, less pyrotechnically and more popularly
to be sure, the modernist ambition of reforming language and life,
especially sexual language and life. It should therefore be understood
as a key text in the still-neglected tradition of twentieth-century
literature that Suzanne Clark has termed sentimental modernism.

<p>
If <i>Married Love</i> clarifies the success of modern women writers'
wartime efforts to transform sexual relations by transforming language,
<i>Love Songs to Joannes</i> clarifies the limitations of those efforts.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Before turning to Loy's revisions of prewar feminism and sex science
 in <i>Love Songs,</i> we need to consider two earlier texts: the
 poem "Parturition," first published in the October 1914 issue of
 <i>The Trend,</i> and the contemporaneous, unpublished "Feminist
 Manifesto." Both of these texts articulate the political and aesthetic
 positions that <i>Love Songs</i> interrogates poetically.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Rejecting the argument that female chastity is proof of woman's
 essential morality and the basis for redress through law and education
 (captured, most famously, in Pankhurst's motto, "Chastity for Men,
 Votes for Women"), Loy's "Feminist Manifesto" insists that "there
 is <i>nothing impure in sex</i>" and that "economic legislation,
 vice crusades &amp; uniform education" only "gloss . . . over
 <i>Reality</i>."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Yet Loy's "Manifesto" does not sanction a defense of sex, in Dora
 Marsden's words, "for its own satisfaction" in place of the purity
 reform

<b></b>

movement's view "that sex is primarily experienced with the motive of
continuing the race."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 Instead, just as <i>Married Love</i> brings together free love's
 autonomous female sexuality and purity's reproductive bourgeois
 marriage, Loy's "Feminist Manifesto" joins free love's pleasurable sex
 outside marriage with purity's reproductive sex understood in terms
 of racial evolution. As DuPlessis writes, in Loy's work "Maternalist
 thinking meets free love."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 Loy's attempt to unite the language of free love and the language of
 racial purity is evident in her manifesto:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Every woman has a right to maternity&#8212;
<br />
Every woman of superior intelligence should realize her
race-responsibility, in producing children in adequate proportion to
the unfit or degenerate members of her sex&#8212;
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Each child of a superior woman should be the result of a
definite period of psychic development in her life&#8212;&amp;
not necessarily of a possibly irksome &amp; outworn continuance of
an alliance&#8212;spontaneously adapted for vital creation in the
beginning but not necessarily harmoniously balanced as the parties to
it&#8212;follow their individual lines of personal evolution&#8212;
[<i>LB,</i> 155]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While Loy relies on arguments crucial to racist and patriarchal
defenses of empire (as would Stopes in a number of her later birth
control manuals), she unconventionally uses them to promote a "race"
of free-loving, independent, and avant-garde mothers and children.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 As rearticulated in Loy's "Feminist Manifesto," the eugenicists' master
 race becomes almost the product of independent female creativity,
 a possibility "Parturition" elaborates and intensifies.

<p>
Loy was not alone among supporters of free love in embracing reproduction
and maternity.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 While most new moralists advocated birth control as a means to advance
 woman's pleasure and self-realization (what Weeks terms the "separation
 of sex from procreation" and Richard Brown calls "copulation without
 population"), some argued that free unions based on true love would
 also advance racial evolution.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Free love eugenicists, who promoted sexual liberation and "voluntary
 motherhood," placed their hopes for racial advance in the so-called
 "Love Child."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 Interweaving languages of free love and eugenics similar to those found
 in Loy's "Manifesto," a 1912 correspondent to the <i>Freewoman</i>
 celebrates the Love Child as:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the <i>beautiful child</i>, i.e., the child born from intense
mutual passion. Such children are always the best physically and
mentally. . . . The child of intense passionate mutual love is as much
in advance of the average child as the European child is in advance of
the negro.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here the logics of scientific racism turn from the task of justifying
British imperial conquest to legitimate free love's ideal of "intense
mutual passion" by declaring the "racial" superiority of the Love Child.

<p>
Reading Loy's "Parturition" in this context clarifies how the poem links
the eugenicist celebration of biological creativity to the modernist
celebration of aesthetic creativity. Scholars have studied Loy's
manipulations of line lengths and white space to

<b></b>

demonstrate linguistically the experiences of labor and contractions
(<i>AM,</i> 45; "NP," 53). "Parturition" also portrays biological
reproduction as a species of aesthetic production; woman poet births
herself as mother superior even as she births a new maternalist free
verse:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->

<br />

the was&#8212;is&#8212;ever&#8212;shall&#8212;be
<br />
Of cosmic reproductivity [<i>LB</i> 6-7]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Loy evokes social purity's spiritualized motherhood, but revises the
religious idealization by displacing the re of God the Father,
who creates the universe through language. In this provocative
rewriting of patriarchal religion, the male creator ("I am that I
am") exists only as a distant echo, the human mother transred
into the "was&#8212;is&#8212;ever&#8212;shall&#8212;be / Of cosmic
reproductivity." "Mother I am," the reborn maternal poet proclaims,
transcending, as the compounding of mutually exclusive temporal
terminology ("was&#8212;is&#8212;ever&#8212;shall&#8212;be) implies,
the limits of masculine reason and creativity.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 The resignifying overthrow of patriarchy's "I am" is formally
 enacted in the overthrow of patriarchal prosody (the hegemony of
 iambs), a victory emphasized by Loy's flashy modulation from free
 verse to rhymed couplet at the moment the speaker is "absorbed"
 into "cosmic reproductivity." Loy's cosmic Mother also rewrites
 eugenics by displacing male science's strategic manipulations of
 natural reproductive processes with the independent supermother whose
 creativity overwhelms male power, science, and poetics.

<p>
"Parturition" realizes poetically the ideal of free loving maternalism
described in Loy's manifesto. The poem affirms the success of this
conjunction of feminist theory and poetic practice by portraying it as
multiply fruitful. As in Stopes's representation of "the art of love,"
the merging of otherwise autonomous categories of language and thought
produces a number of advantages. As Kouidis and Burke point out, the poem

<b></b>

births at once a self-creating, independent Mother; a superior, evolved
Love Child; and a modern feminist verse (<i>AM,</i> 40, "NP," 53). In this
context, the exhortation to "demolish . . . the division of women into
two classes <i>the mistress</i>, &amp; <i>the mother</i>" that appears
in the "Feminist Manifesto" can also be understood as an exhortation to
demolish the division that separates female creativity into the biological
and the aesthetic, and the division that separates language into the
masculine-literal-scientific and the feminine-metaphoric-spiritual
(<i>LB,</i> 154). In this light, Stopes's popular science book appears to
answer the call of Loy's avant-garde polemic; its detailed descriptions
of "physiological facts" in "simple, direct and scientific language"
act to produce a "fusion of joy and rapture . . . not purely physical"
that "sweeps into its flaming tides the whole essence of the man and
woman . . . vaporis[ing] their consciousness so that it fills the whole
of cosmic space" (<i>ML,</i> 80, 75, 106).

<p>
Loy's conception of a female creativity that transcends cultural and
biological oppositions not only promotes women as sexual beings, cultural
producers, and philosophical theorists, but also challenges defensive
assertions by leading male modernists&#8212;especially, F. T. Marinetti
and Ezra Pound&#8212;of male creativity's parthenogenic powers and of
women's essential parasitic passivity.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 Accordingly, "Parturition" demotes the creative potency of the male
 artist:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The open window is full of a voice
<br />
A fashionable portrait painter
<br />
Running upstairs to a woman's apartment
<br />
Sings
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"All the girls are tid'ly did'ly
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All the girls are nice
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whether they wear their hair in curls
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or&#8212;"
<br />
At the back of the thoughts to which I permit crystallization
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The irresponsibility of the male
<br />
Leaves woman her superior inferiority.
<br />
He is running upstairs
<p>
I am climbing a distorted mountain of agony [<i>LB,</i> 5]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>
<br />


<p>
Loy's jagged free verse satirizes cultural ideals of male power, courage,
and responsibility. This "man"&#8212;likely based on Loy's unfaithful
husband Stephen Haweis-displays conventional traits of femininity:
fashionable, he voices the childish languages of sentimental love,
"running" away from the speaker's agonizing creative labor. The quotation
exposes woman's alleged inferiority as a cultural fa&ccedil;ade that
conceals her true superiority. As rendered in the "Feminist Manifesto"
and "Parturition," free unions finally serve to evolve the individualist
woman beyond dependence on man.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 In contrast to Stopes's language of productive sexuality, which depends
 on love's sentimental languages, "Parturition" forges a language of
 productive female sexuality freed from sentimental attachments to men.

<b></b>

<p>
Despite these resonances with the "Feminist Manifesto"'s radical
maternalism, however, "Parturition" reveals doubts about the theory,
exposing its conceptual problematics. That woman's "superior inferiority"
can also be read, as Lyon shows, to emphasize a sense of woman's
inferiority, isolation, and dependence, raises questions about the poem's
commitment to maternalism ("PP," 388). That the "LIFE" the speaker births
barely engages her attention ("Touch of infinitesimal motion / Scarcely
perceptible"), raises questions as to whether this "Love Child" is "in
advance of the average child," and thus whether the ideal of reproductive
free love based on "intense passionate mutual love" has been realized.

<p>
Indeed, the conjunction of biological and cultural creativity multiplies
the possibilities that the ideal of reproductive free love will
fail. By subscribing to the teleological conception of sex associated
with eugenics and by embracing the Love Child as the proof of free love,
"Feminist Manifesto" and "Parturition" make aesthetic production dependent
on biological reproduction. Loy's <i>Love Songs to Joannes</i> gives
voice to this problem by enacting the failure of free love maternalism,
thus thwarting the "maternalist hopes" that animate the earlier works
("SO," 62-3).
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<i>Love Songs</i> represents this failure as biological because Loy's
free lovers cannot bring their relationship to eugenic fruition in the
production of a Love Child:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We might have coupled
<br />
In the bedridden monopoly of a moment
<br />
Or broken flesh with one another
<br />
At the profane communion table
<br />
Where wine is spilled on promiscuous lips
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We might have given birth to a butterfly
<br />
With the daily news
<br />
Printed in blood on its wings [<i>LB,</i> 54]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While the first stanza flamboyantly yokes the lexicons of religion and
sex as in "Parturition," the conjunction does not enact formally the
productive union of free lovers. Loy emphasizes the incommensurability of
these lexicons to stress the lovers' failure to validate their union by
birthing the Love Child. Hence the second stanza's image of the unrealized
product of this "coupling" remains difficult to pin down. Is this bloody
butterfly a supernatural embodiment of the avant-garde dream of bridging
the great divides between art and praxis? Is it a modernist icon that
transres the quotidian into transcendent art? Or is it an imagistic
freak of nature that naturalizes the failure of free love by implying
that the Love Child is as fantastic and unrealizable as the productive
sexual conjunction of the human species and the insect?
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
This poetic interrogation of reproductive free love not only limits
the female creativity celebrated in the "Feminist Manifesto" and
"Parturition." It also evokes the pathologizing, categorizing impulses
of most European sexology. Exemplary of this tendency is Richard von
Krafft-Ebing's <i>Psychopathia Sexualis</i> , which sought to
classify the entire range of sexual pathologies, labeling "degenerate"
any sexual practice

<b></b>

that deviated from the alleged normality of reproductive heterosexual
intercourse.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 From such a normalizing sexological perspective, the love affair
 portrayed in <i>Love Songs</i> appears degenerate because it is not
 biologically fruitful:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
The contents
<br />
Of our ephemeral conjunction
<br />
In aloofness from Much
<br />
Flowed to approachment of&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
<br />
NOTHING
<br />
There was a man and a woman
<br />
In the way [<i>LB,</i> 63-4]
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Man and woman function prophylactically to prohibit the biological
reproduction crucial to eugenic free love ("SO," 62). The lovers'
"ephemeral conjunction" yields "NOTHING." In this light, <i>Love Songs</i>
is a post-free love poem as DuPlessis suggests; the conjunction of
science's clinical language and love's sentimental language portrays
the obstruction of free love and the Love Child.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 Unlike Stopes's <i>Married Love,</i> Loy's <i>Love Songs</i> finds
 no lasting marriage between freewoman and man, sentiment and science,
 biology and culture.

<p>
Accordingly, the ideal of the reproductive free union of evolved true
lovers generates no corresponding formal union. In <i>Love Songs,</i>
vocabularies of science and rationality cohabit antagonistically with
vocabularies of love and sentiment, opposing and undermining each
other, enacting formally the unrealizability of union between lovers
and languages. <i>Love Songs</i> resists, as Shreiber argues, the
lyric tradition of aesthetic compensation for this failure; its uses
of fragmentation, collage, jarring juxtaposition, and satire irritate
readers, as Twittchel-Waas suggests, frustrating the sentimental
identification necessary for such compensations.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 The "truths of sex" <i>Love Songs</i> exposes are discordant,
 contradictory, and ugly:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The skin-sack
<br />
In which a wanton duality
<br />
Packed
<br />
All the completion of my infructuous impulses
<br />
Something the shape of a man
<br />
To the casual vulgarity of the merely observant
<br />
More of a clock-work mechanism
<br />
Running down against time
<br />
To which I am not paced [<i>LB,</i> 53-4]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Loy's graphic descriptions of sex organs undermine the idealizing
celebration of spiritual union. As depicted here, scrotum and testicles
emphasize the biological <i>in</i>compatibility of women and men. While
<i>Married Love</i> affirms that the "race desire" of men, "always
present, ever ready to wake," can be "adapt[ed]," "adjust[ed],"
and "repress[ed]" into "harmony" with the "intermittent" "nature" of
women's desire, this stanza makes such harmonizing regulation impossible
(<i>ML,</i> 72-3). Loy renders the

<b></b>

speaker's realization of this incompatibility a source of pathos; yet
it also provokes her bitterness and the satiric metaphor of her beloved
as genitals.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 "Parturition"'s independent mother is displaced by a dependent
 female lover, whose creative agency is circumscribed by the beloved's
 unwillingness to accommodate her desires and to share his sperm to
 "complete" their union in the Love Child; her creative and sexual
 "impulses" remain unfulfilled, "infructuous." <i>Love Songs</i> aborts
 "Parturition"'s conjunction of free love and free verse; it turns free
 verse from a medium that realizes free love into one that interrogates
 and dissects it.

<p>
Yet as the lurking pathos of these lines suggests, Loy's speaker
does not wholeheartedly embrace (masculine) modernism's programmatic
antisentimentalism, its ironic detachment from love.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 Accordingly, the next stanza reasserts the attachment to the
 unattainable beloved that is central to lyric sentimentality:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My fingertips are numb from fretting your hair
<br />
A God's doormat
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the threshold of your mind [<i>LB,</i> 54]
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Attending this recurrence of unrequited love for the beloved is the
reappearance of the male God banished in "Parturition." Loy's speaker
remains fretful that physical contact does not ensure emotional and
spiritual union, despite the damning self-description implied by
the metaphor of her beloved's hair as "God's doormat." Indeed, the
aesthetic power of the stanza and of <i>Love Songs</i> overall depends
on Loy's refusal to resolve the poem's ambivalence between a modernist
resistance to the sentimental and an attachment to love and the topoi
of lyric. Like the re of the unrealized or aborted Love Child, the
languages of sentimentality periodically interrupt the poem's overriding
posture of ironic and analytical detachment, reasserting the discredited
sentiment of love ("SO," 64, "LTM," 32). Loy's <i>Love Songs</i> remains
suspended between free love and social purity, literature and science,
sentimentalism and modernism.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 It is this suspension that I want, finally, to emphasize.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 For her poetic appropriations of sex science modernistically rewrite the
 languages of female sexuality even as they illuminate the limitations
 of modernism's reformist aesthetic and sexual ambitions.

<p>
But my point is neither to lament those limits, nor to criticize
Stopes, Loy, or their contemporaries for the "failings" of their
writing and politics. Both Stopes's scientific defense of sentimental
love and Loy's ironic dissection of reproductive free love confirm that
writing new models of sexuality will not fully realize those models in
praxis. Thus, while <i>Married Love</i> and <i>Love Songs</i> may not
fulfill Sanger's ideal of a "more courageous womanhood, devoid of petty
shames," they do succeed in questioning the "great divide" between science
and literature, intellect and sentiment, and in forging new relations
between these allegedly incompatible disciplines and discourses. As
we've seen, both Stopes and Loy understood well that idioms of scientific
rationality served to legitimate modern science as a realm of masculine
objectivity. By applying those idioms to reformist ends, <i>Married
Love</i> and <i>Love Songs</i> challenge the sexist mythology

<b></b>

of female irrationality and affirm women's fitness to write in and revise
the lexicons of science and intellect. At a time when male writers defined
literary modernism as a realm of antisentimental, masculine impersonality,
Stopes's and Loy's books modernize sentimentalism by conjoining idioms
of scientific rationality and impersonal detachment with vocabularies of
lyric sentiment, thus affirming the continuing relevance of sentimentality
to modernism's efforts to reform gender by rewriting sex.

While <i>Married Love</i> is not explicit on the subject, Stopes's
assertion that "70 or 80 per cent of our married women (in the
middle classes) are deprived of . . . full orgasm," suggests that she
accepted the common bourgeoisie view of the working class as, in Weeks
words, "condemned . . . to sexual rampancy and immorality" (<i>SP,</i>
32-3). Weeks also articulates the paradoxical nature of Stopes's relations
to working-class women: while "she evoked an immediate response amongst
working-class women," she "displayed nevertheless a deep ignorance of
working-class life" (<i>SP,</i> 191). Cf. Richard A. Soloway, "Marie
Stopes, Eugenics and the Birth Control Movement," in <i>Marie Stopes,
Eugenics, and the English Birth Control Movement,</i> ed. Robert
A. Peel (London: Galton Institute, 1997), 49-76. Soloway argues that
"While her writings about the poor were often harsh, condescending, and
censorious, and at times she seemed to have difficulty thinking of them
as being motivated by much more than dangerous and ignorant impulses for
immediate gratification, Stopes could be deeply moved and horrified by
the individual plight of some of the impoverished mothers who wrote her
and came to the clinic" .

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The status of sexology as science, and Stopes' socialization as a
scientist, resulted in her initial commitment to female sexual autonomy
being undermined by an essentially phallocentric model of sexuality,
in which sex was reduced to a coital imperative. Far from empowering
women . . . it reinforced male power in heterosexual relationships by
eroticizing male dominance and female submission and underpinning them by
so called 'laws of love.'. . . Stopes' model of sexuality also undermined
relationships between women, by defining them as unnatural and perverted,
and helped to fuel the anti-spinster backlash. [155, cf. 132]

Despite, or perhaps because of, years of neglect, Loy's work has,
since around 1980, prompted a (growing) number of scholars to produce a
particularly distinguished and illuminating body of scholarship. Janet
Lyon wryly terms it a "Loy boom"; Lyon, "Mina Loy's Pregnant Pauses:

especially useful include: Rachel Blau DuPlessis, "'Seismic Orgasm':

As Weeks points out, Stopes too "fully shared the eugenic world view,"
although <i>Married Love</i> is less explicitly eugenic than her later
works (<i>SP,</i> 190; see also <i>ML,</i> 106-18). In <i>Radiant
Motherhood: A Book for Those Who Are Creating the Future</i> (London:
Putnam, 1920), for instance, Stopes laments that



<blockquote>

society allows . . . the very lowest and worst members of the community,
to produce innumerable tens of thousands of stunted warped and inferior
infants. If they live, a large proportion of them are doomed from

DuPlessis argues that "Loy exists in an angry mourning for the lack of or

reasons, of sexual intercourse and reproduction, which can be the most
traditional justification for the sexual embrace" ("SO," 64); cf. "LL,"

<a name="FOOT43" href="#REF43">43</a>.
That Loy does not use the more familiar metaphor of man as penis&#8212;a
favorite of Pound, for instance&#8212;suggests her possible familiarity
with sexological accounts of the glandular basis of sexual desire
(<i>SP,</i> 147). Interestingly, Loy was asked about her friendship
with Pound for a 1943 <i>Picture Magazine</i> article, she replied that
Pound was fascinated by the topic of "endocrine glands": "He would talk
about it a great deal&#8212;very learned discussion. Glands . . . were
the latest thing at the time." See Marisa Januzzi, "Mongrel Rose: The

Twitchell-Waas notes that "the torsion of the <i>Songs</i> twists between. . . extremes of utopian enlargement and ironical cynicism" ("LL," 116).

<p>
<a name="FOOT46" href="#REF46">46</a>.
Twitchell-Waas contends that Loy's reader is often "left suspended,"
and that her poem's "unnerving undecidability is itself an effort to
suspend the gender distinctions the poems bring to critical consciousness"
("LL," 112, 113).

<p>
On 1 August 1915, thousands of citizens and uniformed Irish Volunteer,
Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), and Irish Citizen Army (ICA)
members gathered at Dublin's Glasnevin Cemetary around the grave of
Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, a Fenian hero who had been accused by the
English of plotting rebellion in 1865, sentenced to penal servitude,
and then lived the remainder of his life in exile in the United
States. Patrick Pearse delivered a graveside oration claiming that the
dead body of O'Donovan Rossa revealed the truth of English oppression,
a speech that he hoped would unite public opinion in accordance with his
revolutionary ideals. Like other Irish nationalists, Pearse understood
that the emotional affect generated by the funeral of a hero might be
harnessed into political action, that collective mourning, focused
through the construction and veneration of a national martyr, might
construct a national community.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 According to Pearse, the spectacle of O'Donovan Rossa's funeral not only
 exposed the ways in which the English persecuted the Irish, but also
 galvanized the Irish public against their colonizers: "The Defenders of
 this Realm have worked well in secret and in the open. They think that
 they have pacified Ireland. They think that they have purchased half
 of us and intimidated the other half . . . but the fools, the fools,
 the fools!&#8212;they have left us our Fenian dead."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
If Pearse spoke for O'Donovan Rossa and defined the role of the "Fenian
dead" for the Irish public, it was Terence MacSwiney, the poet-playwright
and Lord Mayor of Cork, who created and then disseminated the fiction of
how O'Donovan Rossa represented the ideal Irish hero worthy of this role.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 In 1915,

<b></b>

MacSwiney wrote a memorial pamphlet commemorating O'Donovan Rossa. In it,
he makes no mention of O'Donovan Rossa's condemnation of the Catholic
Church, and there is no acknowledgment of the rumors that before his
death O'Donovan Rossa had reconciled with the British and condemned the
Germans. Instead, MacSwiney's Rossa is a forthright champion of Irish
nationalism, a hero whose demeanor reveals internal virtue. MacSwiney
recounts, "I, myself, saw Rossa in his old age going to his Easter
Duty in the Cathedral at Cork; and the picture I have in mind of him. . . makes for me a perfect picture of the consistent life."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Likewise, MacSwiney's Rossa speaks forthrightly, a characteristic
 supported by the real-life O'Donovan Rossa, who famously defended
 himself against treason at his English trial simply by asserting,
 "I believe in God, but I defy the Devil" ("R," 14). MacSwiney
 champions this defense by insisting, "If we all have as pure a faith
 as Rossa's and act up to it with as fine a constancy, Ireland shall
 have no need to despair" (ibid.). The abstract values of "faith" and
 "constancy" become material and visible when MacSwiney locates them
 in the body of a specific individual. Those who celebrated O'Donovan
 Rossa's death could read his words as "literal truth" because of his
 well-established constancy, the torture he endured at the hands of
 the English, and his final assertion that certain clear terms must
 remain in place&#8212;love God, hate the Devil; love the Irish nation,
 hate English tyranny. When MacSwiney insisted that "we all" can share
 in O'Donovan Rossa's faith and "act up to it," he presented Irish
 citizens with a means of salvation for the nation. The public body
 of the dead hero, as described by MacSwiney, provided the Irish "we"
 with a model of reliable moral behavior.

<p>
In his five-act drama <i>The Revolutionist</i> , written one year
before O'Donovan Rossa's funeral, MacSwiney set forth a similar message:
the Irish public could be consolidated and inspired by the funeral of a
hero who had displayed his authenticity to a public. The play's central
character, Hugh O'Neill, is a revolutionary hero who offers the Irish
public his straightforward brand of nationalism in an attempt to rescue
them from the secret political societies that pervade Ireland following
the institution of Home Rule.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Hugh refuses to align himself with his revolutionary colleagues who
 long for secret societies because he believes Irish nationalists
 must keep "the t straight and consistent" (<i>RAP,</i> 11). He
 fears that secrecy will divide the Irish public and encourage them
 to t among themselves, rather than to work together against
 the English. According to MacSwiney's characterization of Hugh, the
 Irish hero must maintain a consistent private self, which he can then
 display in order to keep the terms of the battle between the Irish
 and the English visible. Throughout the play Hugh searches for a way
 to reconcile the increasingly fragmented Irish publics and expose the
 "truth" (a term MacSwiney never clarifies) to them; in doing so, he
 realizes the fantasy of death may be the best means by which to unite
 the Irish. He insists that Robert Emmet, the executed Irish hero of
 the 1798 rebellion, had the proper notion of how to draw the public
 together. Referring to the speech Emmet delivered immediately before
 the British executed him for treason, Hugh claims that "Emmet's last
 words move us more than any possible oration he might have delivered
 as first president of the Irish Republic" (<i>RAP,</i> 92). In this
 speech, Emmet represented himself as "the sacrifice," a

<b></b>

hero who inspired the Irish through his martyrdom and his famous final
words: "Let no man write my epitaph . . . until other times and other
men can do justice to my character."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 While the political rhetoric of the living Emmet may have failed to
 inspire his audiences, Hugh insists that "Men standing by a premature
 grave are apt to reconsider their hasty judgments and indolent lives"
 (<i>RAP,</i> 92). Again, MacSwiney celebrates the notion that "other
 men" can perform Emmet's brand of Irish heroism, particularly if they
 are inspired by a communal celebration of heroic martyrdom&#8212;a truth
 made evident when Hugh dies in the service of the nation. Through his
 self-sacrifice, Hugh publicly verifies his true private nature as an
 embodiment of the heroic ideal to "be faithful forever" (<i>RAP,</i>
 136). By viewing his corpse at a national funeral, MacSwiney claims,
 the Irish public will see the merit of Hugh's "open" and "straight"
 nationalism and therefore will subscribe to his beliefs.

<p>
In both <i>The Revolutionist</i> and his pamphlet for O'Donovan Rossa,
MacSwiney forcefully argued that the public display of the heroic
martyred body was the most effective means by which to consolidate
a national citizenship. Through self-sacrifice, he insisted, <i>The
Revolutionist</i>'s fictional hero and the real-life O'Donovan Rossa
both used their bodies to announce their heroism, which was revealed
through the display of their congruent public and private integrity in
the face of English deception. But MacSwiney did more than simply renovate
literary and historical tropes of heroic death for a contemporary reading
public. During the Anglo-Irish War, he took on and lived out the heroic
role he had created for Hugh O'Neill and ascribed to O'Donovan Rossa. On
12 August 1920, soon after he had assumed his duties as Lord Mayor of
Cork and Commandant of the First Cork Brigade of the Irish Volunteers,
MacSwiney was arrested by British authorities during their raid of a
Volunteer meeting at the Cork City Hall.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 To protest his arrest he began a highly publicized hunger strike
 that culminated in his death in London's Brixton Prison seventy-four
 days later. By modeling and then reworking the long history of heroic
 martyrdom across cultures and religions, he offered his own emaciated
 body to the mass public as a means of displaying the moral superiority
 of the Irish to the English. The international press obsessively
 reported on each new development in his hunger strike, which MacSwiney
 and his compatriots represented as a purifying ritual that would shed
 the light of truth on British oppression and thus motivate the Irish
 and international publics to support the revolutionary cause.

<p>
I describe MacSwiney as a modernist martyr because the discourse
surrounding his death&#8212;a discourse he helped to create&#8212;reveals
that Irish nationalism, while deeply invested in traditional modes of
thought, was also committed to the deployment of modern practices to
free Ireland and to construct a cohesive national identity for its
people. Although MacSwiney celebrated traditional modes of heroism,
his use of his own body as a text through which to manipulate public
opinion marks him as a savvy manipulator of modern, mass cultural modes of
expression. Theorists of modernity and embodiment from Walter Benjamin
to Allen Feldman have noted that with the advent of mass culture,
images of the body become ubiquitous&#8212;as Michael Warner claims,
to be public in the West is to have an "iconicity," or a body whose
image can be displayed to the masses through print and visual media.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Through mass culture the

<b></b>

body becomes a text upon which messages can be inscribed, literally
or ratively, and then disseminated to the public. Like many of
the res involved in the Irish Literary Revival, MacSwiney merged
tradition and modernity when, by displaying his iconic body through
press statements made by family and acquaintances, he offered his model
of heroic subjectivity as a "style of publicity" available to a modern,
international public.

<p>
In many ways, MacSwiney's self-sacrifice appears to be an act lodged
firmly in the historic and mythic past. He based his style of Irish
heroism on traditional models of subjectivity, drawing from examples
provided both by religious and political martyrs and by the self-unified
Enlightenment public subject.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 By choosing self-sacrifice as his weapon, he invoked the long political,
 religious, and cultural legacy of the hunger strike to t the
 colonial government. His self-sacrifice resonated loudly with events
 in the Gaelic history and literature celebrated by the Irish Literary
 Revival, it evoked Catholic and Protestant iconography, and it pointed
 to a long legacy of Irish rebellions. Thus, his martyrdom powerfully
 engaged with a broad spectrum of tropes that defined Irish nationalist
 culture, which relied heavily on the past to represent the Irish as
 primitive and spiritual in contrast to the modern and corrupted English.

<p>
Yet the discourse surrounding MacSwiney's death reveals that his intended
audience differed radically from the audience sought by the historical
martyrs to whom he was likened. In particular, his choice of the hunger
strike foregrounded the differences between historical martyrdoms and
his own modernist version. Throughout history, individuals had fasted in
order to gain the attention of an autonomous higher authority, to demand
favor from a monarch or from God. In the mythos of ancient pre-Christian
Ireland, the code of law&#8212;the <i>Senchas M&aacute;r</i>&#8212;allowed
that an aggrieved person could starve on the doorstep of his oppressor
to redress an injustice, an edict Yeats dramatized in <i>The King's
Threshold</i> . The oppressor was required either to feed the
injured party or, if the starving individual died, to pay compensation to
the victim's family. In Christian tradition, Christ and various saints
had engaged in prolonged fasts for a variety of reasons, most often
to gain God's favor. With the advent of modernity, however, it becomes
clear that the intended audience of the fast had changed. MacSwiney's
hunger strike was represented as an appeal for intervention directed
neither toward God nor the English government, but toward two audiences
of his peers: the national public, who in modern times articulate their
opinions through the press and shape policy through the electorate,
and an international public, who helped to fund and publicize the Irish
quest for freedom. As his brother Peter MacSwiney insisted, "He is dying
to bring all these atrocities before the people of the world."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
MacSwiney was well aware that the suffering Irish body might be displayed
before Irish and English publics for political efficacy; it seems he
might also have been aware that the mass circulation of accounts of
his body's sufferings might influence the world's perception of the
Irish community. By scripting his own pure death and then successfully
following that script to the letter, he provided the mass public a more
disciplined and less contentious sacrificial model than was offered by
the rebels of the Easter Rising.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 His hunger strike also resonated with the infamous strikes staged a
 decade earlier by the English and Irish suffragists. By affiliating
 himself with these women,

<b></b>

who had aggressively publicized their sufferings under the English
constabulary, MacSwiney reinforced the perception of the English
government as oppressing innocent (and starving) victims ting for
their political rights. In addition, his hunger strike reminded the public
of the government's enforcement against the suffragists of the duplicitous
"Temporary Discharge of Ill Health Act" (the "Cat and Mouse Act"),
thus reinforcing the perception of the English government as tricksters
practicing the "English lie" ("R," 3). He thus engaged the sentiment of
those moved by these renowned injustices while simultaneously reinforcing
the image of the Irish as passive victims of English abuse. His intensely
visible body, whose masculinity was insisted upon at every turn, provided
a public text on which contesting messages could enrich rather than
deplete each other. He was both religious icon and secular, political
martyr; the passive, feminine victim, but also the active, masculine hero.

<p>
MacSwiney's hunger strike also offered a revision of the Irish
revolutionary Thomas Ashe's famous hunger strike, which had been staged
three years earlier. Ashe's death from force-feeding by the British
was regarded by the Irish as a murder, and his funeral presaged a new
wave of Irish militancy, which the English responded to by sending the
notoriously brutal Auxiliary forces and the Black and Tans to Ireland.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Both the English and the Irish press closely covered the atrocities
 these forces wrought; that coverage, in conjunction with the lingering
 resentment from the Easter Rising and the English desire for peace
 following World War I, meant that by the time of MacSwiney's death
 public opinion had undergone a tremendous change.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Worldwide public opinion was now largely in favor of a truce between
 the Irish and English. In many ways MacSwiney's death, which fell
 during the bloodiest phase of the Anglo-Irish War, can be regarded
 as a canny public relations move that responded to and helped create
 this shift in public opinion by offering a widely circulated image of
 Irish death as a "bloodless conquest."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Because his death was clean and direct, his body could be understood
 as a hieroglyph of passive resistance and nonviolent force against
 the English. His only weapons were his body and his sheer force of will.

<p>
Above all, his martyrdom must be understood as a promise to the mass
public that the Irish hero was a role any citizen could perform, a
promise that offered diverse individuals equal access to his valorous
persona. Many early-twentieth-century politicians and writers affiliated
with the Irish Literary Revival had argued that "Irishness" was predicated
on an authentic Celtic or Gaelic racial identity; they represented Irish
national identity to their audiences as an imperishable essence embedded
only in Irish citizens.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 In contrast, modernist thought, according to theorists like Stuart Hall,
 represents cultural identity as "free floating . . . disembedded from
 specific times, places, histories and traditions."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 MacSwiney's martyrdom worked to reconcile the essentialist ideology
 of identity offered by revivalism and this "free floating" ideology
 of identity offered by modernism. On the one hand, he propounded a
 revivalist sensibility that declared wholly congruent selfhood&#8212;a
 private, authentic nobility that registered publicly&#8212;to be
 a crucial aspect of authentic Irish heroism. Both O'Donovan Rossa
 and <i>The Revolutionist</i>'s Hugh are described by MacSwiney as
 self-unified men whose self-sacrifice further reveals their inherent
 heroism&#8212;thus their bodies can serve as

<b></b>

symbols of Irish national spirit. In an essay entitled "The Secret of
Strength," MacSwiney insisted upon this brand of congruent Irish heroism
when he asserted, "You cannot take up such a [heroic] character like
a garment to suit the occasion: it must be developed in private and
public by all those daily acts that declare a man's attitude, register
his convictions, and form his mind."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 However, he simultaneously insisted that heroic martyrdom achieved
 through self-sacrifice was a role any Irishman could perform through
 appropriate public and private action&#8212;a "fiction" of heroism
 that the "non-fictional" accounts of his own hunger strike and death
 then supported. This is the key to MacSwiney's modernist martyrdom:
 on the one hand, the martyr offers an essentialist mode of heroism
 located in the distant mythic time that preceded colonization, and
 through his self-unity publicly bears the marks of a heroic subjectivity
 specific to the religious and political tenets of Irish nationalism;
 on the other hand, this mode of heroism serves as a garment that can
 be worn as the Irish "style of publicity" by those who follow the
 terms so clearly described by MacSwiney's "brand."

<p>
Because it successfully negotiated the tensions between these opposing
models of identity, the Irish public could identify with MacSwiney's
particular mode of political agency. The real power of his martyrdom
rested on the notion that he had constructed and performed a traditional
heroic role available to modern citizens. Ireland's nationalist
press, literary res, and politicians colluded in representing
MacSwiney's sacrifice as a role available to all citizens. As <i>The
Irish Independent</i> reported following the death of the "Patriot of
Plain Men," MacSwiney "set the standard for the generality of men. For
though but one man in a generation&#8212;and it seems even as if he must
be foreordained for it&#8212;may aspire to be a Pearse, it is in all of
us to become a MacSwiney, dare we but put away as he did all self-seeking
and insincerity."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 Similarly, in his autobiographical account of being a young
 "rank-and-filer" for the IRA, Sean O'Faolain recalled guarding
 MacSwiney's body during the Cork lying-in-state. For O'Faolain, the
 real power of MacSwiney's death was the way in which it asserted that
 "There was only one thing that every one of us knew he could do well,
 and must do well if called on to do it, the least active rank-and-filer,
 the humblest citizen. If arrested and condemned for any or no reason,
 each man knew that he could die&#8212;'For Ireland!'"
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 In America, the Irish politician Eamon De Valera praised MacSwiney's
 hunger strike in a speech worth note because, although De Valera was
 well-fed and traveling freely throughout the States, he could claim that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
my role here to-day is that of one speaking for a man who is dying,
but who, like the great champions of American liberty in their day, had
decent respect for the opinions of mankind, and who, when he is ready
to die for these principles, wants, at least, that the world should
understand the motive which is prompting him to give up his life. I am
speaking here to-night as I would like, if I were in MacSwiney's place
that someone would speak for me.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
MacSwiney is no longer a single embodied referent in the material world;
instead, his abstraction by the public and the press allows anyone to
ventriloquize him. Here, De Valera "speaks" for the imprisoned MacSwiney
so that "the world" might better understand

<b></b>

his motives. Just as MacSwiney scripted and then performed Hugh's
sacrifice for the nation, now De Valera, the Irish populace, and even
Americans could assume that same role and help to publicize MacSwiney's
political principles.

<p>
By consistently describing MacSwiney's struggle as a kind of theater,
press accounts of the hunger strike reinforced the notion that his heroism
was a dramatic role any citizen could perform before an audience; in doing
so, these accounts stressed that public display was a crucial component
of modern self-sacrifice. <i>The London Times</i> titled one account of
his death "A Political Tragedy," while the New York <i>Central News</i>
insisted of his sacrifice, "Call it folly, call it madness, there it
is just the same&#8212;a gesture of deep tragedy on a stage where all
mankind looks on."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
<i>The Irish Independent</i> stated on the day of his death that "The
last act of the Brixton tragedy was enacted yesterday morning with the
death of the heroic prisoner."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 Of course, the invocation of theatrical metaphors to describe
 MacSwiney's martyrdom threatens the essentialism upon which Irish
 national identity rests; with it arises the anxiety that somehow
 there will be inauthenticity and deception, the putting on of Irish
 identity as a costume. Thus, Irish press accounts of MacSwiney's
 heroism aggressively compensate for the ambiguity that accompanies his
 martyrdom by stressing his self-unity&#8212;the same strategy that
 MacSwiney deployed in his own constructions of Irish martyrdom. For
 instance, an account of MacSwiney's final days that appeared in <i>The
 Freeman's Journal,</i> remarkably entitled "The Drama of Brixton,"
 invokes theatrical metaphors to describe his sacrifice, but at the
 same time insists that his invisible spirit will triumph, that his
 real victory cannot be seen:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
strength and comfort come to him in ways not seen of the objective eye,
for as the body dies the spirit approaches to the world of the spirit,
drawing sustenance from its native element, till the doubts and fears and
hesitations born of the clay vanish in clouds of roseate hope. . . . [T]he
torture of the body is forgotten in a great, ineffable peace of the soul.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While such accounts may invoke theatrical metaphors, they simultaneously
stress the congruence between MacSwiney's private and public selves,
his honesty, and his love of Ireland. These truths were supported by
the wide circulation of his last words: "I want you to bear witness to
the fact that I die a soldier of the Irish Republic. God save Ireland."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
In his assessment of his recently martyred friend, Daniel Corkery
summarized what made MacSwiney so powerful to the Irish:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Any great movement towards a spiritual end, such as Ireland's present
push for freedom, obviously endows itself with creative power, as if
otherwise it could not progress; it takes the most diverse types and
unifies them, as all who to-day walk the streets of Ireland must openly
acknowledge. The explanation is that in such movements men like Terence
MacSwiney act out the desires of their souls, express those desires in
living matter, the dearest that is, flesh and blood. Such men we speak
of as master-spirits, master minds, outstanding res, commanding
personalities&#8212;all good words, if none be quite the right word.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Corkery insists on the capacity not just of MacSwiney himself, but also
of "men <i>like</i> Terence MacSwiney," to "<i>act</i> out the desires
of their soul." The power of those who take on the role that MacSwiney
imagined and performed is that they display in "flesh and blood" the
"spiritual end" that seeks freedom for Ireland. By using mass culture
and by letting mass culture use him, the modernist martyr displays his
integrated self to the international public; he "takes the most diverse
types and unifies them."

Burying MacSwiney, Birthing Ireland: 
<br />
Celebrating the Modernist Martyr's
Death
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Thus far, I've argued that the iconic body of the Irish martyr held a
tremendous amount of political potential because of its capacity both
to offer citizens a widely available and readily inhabitable heroic
subjectivity and to present the modern mass public with a traditional
model of citizenship that enfolds them in the "imagined community"
of Ireland. Often, however, theorists represent these modern publics as
bodiless phantasmagorias. Warner claims that "the mass subject cannot have
a body except the body it witnesses," and Benedict Anderson describes his
"imagined communities" as limited, sovereign political nationalities where
only "in the minds of each [citizen] lives the image of their communion."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 The funerals of MacSwiney&#8212;which gathered together hundreds of
 thousands of mourners in Ireland and across the globe&#8212;allow us to
 ask an important question about modern communities: What happens when
 these national abstractions and imaginings appear as audiences that
 come together in a shared space and time? To answer this question,
 I will examine the three major funeral processions that celebrated
 MacSwiney's sacrifice: the funeral procession and lying-in-state in
 London; the corpseless funeral procession in Dublin; and the funeral
 procession, lying-in-state, and burial in Cork.

<p>
From Thursday, 28 October to Sunday, 31 October 1920, the citizens of the
British Isles were described as a homogeneous public. In accounts of each
of these three funeral processions, observers seem astounded by the ways
in which diverse audiences came together peacefully in shared public grief
for this Irish hero. During the London mass held in St. George's Cathedral
in Southwark, for instance, the mourners were described as representing
"all classes and conditions of Irish people in London . . . [along with]
large numbers of persons who could lay no claim to Irish birth or descent,
but . . . who preferred death to the abandonment of a great principle."
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 During MacSwiney's Dublin funeral celebration, the press described a
 public united in what <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> labeled "a day of
 universal sadness and mourning" in which, <i>The New York Times</i>
 asserted, "The inhabitants turned out virtually as a whole for the
 occasion."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 During MacSwiney's funeral and burial in his native Cork, a similarly
 diverse community formed. <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> described the
 mood: "It was as if the whole community was spellbound in a single
 calamity. The entire population of the city, swelled by crowds of
 mourners from beyond its limits, knelt at the graveside of Terence
 MacSwiney and there dedicated themselves to the hero-martyr and pledged
 his name and fame and sacrifice to immortality."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Just as MacSwiney had imagined in <i>The Revolutionist</i> and his
pamphlet on O'Donovan Rossa, the display of his corpse did in fact
consolidate the Irish. At the Cork lying-in-state, for instance, <i>The
Freeman's Journal</i> expressed astonishment at both the diversity of the
public and its unified response to the body. It extolled the immediate,
face-to-face encounter between mourner and corpse offered by traditional
funeral rituals when it remarked, "the wonder was where the people, men,
women, children, old and young, well-to-do and poor, clergy and laymen,
came from to make up the inexhaustible stream that ever circled and flowed
round the coffin holding the body of the chief magistrate, without fear,
without reproach."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Strikingly, another report illustrated how MacSwiney's body had become
 a mass article through the wide circulation of his image, when it
 celebrated the way in which his lying-in-state allowed the public to
 "gaze once more straight into the features, now, alas, sadly familiar
 to millions of Irish eyes."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 This account acknowledges that mass culture has disseminated MacSwiney's
 "features" to "millions of Irish eyes," suggesting that these "Irish
 eyes" might reside in bodies located outside of Ireland. While <i>The
 Freeman's Journal</i> described the oscillation between the real and
 imagined Irish community, another press account noted the slippage
 between the "real" MacSwiney and his fictions of heroism. As the
 commentator "Jacques" wrote in <i>The Irish Independent,</i> the
 intimate encounter between mourner and corpse in Cork resembled
 the model of heroic martyrdom MacSwiney celebrated in <i>The
 Revolutionist</i>: "In one fleeting moment I recalled the death of
 Hugh, the Hero of MacSwiney's historical drama 'The Revolutionist.' I
 remembered how, in the final tragedy of the troubled career of that
 indomitable re, the author pictured Hugh in his last sleep, just
 as now I saw Hugh's creator&#8212;fearless and calm with the look of
 the conqueror."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 MacSwiney's martyrdom provided an iconic body that served as a
 palimpsest for models of heroic protest, traditional and modern,
 real and fictional. It also provided a device to consolidate a public
 that was both traditional in its capacity to gather people together in
 shared time and space and modern in its capacity to shape an imagined,
 international community in the "millions."

<p>
Ironically, despite the thousands who gathered, MacSwiney's funerals
appeared to generate little immediate political action. By offering
the public myriad points of identification, the display of his corpse
allowed ostensibly antagonistic citizens in England and Ireland
access to a shared feeling of Irishness and of loss&#8212;even as
these citizens directly encountered other individuals who bore the
markers of radically different political, social, religious, and gender
categories. A close study of the funerals staged in London, Dublin, and
Cork reveals that the press, literature, religious ritual, and a variety
of institutions&#8212;traditional and modern&#8212;explicitly worked
to repress the revolutionary power that might have erupted during the
public celebrations of his martyrdom. The accounts of these funerals also
establish that the technologies of mass culture turned their attention
from MacSwiney's iconic body, which during his hunger strike had come
to represent revolutionary defiance, to the bodies of the Irish public
who mourned him. By doing so, mass culture served both the English and
the Irish causes. It defused the funeral of its potential to generate
immediate violent retribution against the English while also representing
the Irish as a cohesive and well-behaved national community.

<br />
The Mourning Masses on Stage
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Press accounts of the London funeral celebration staged on 28 October
suggested that a funeral by definition can not only draw together
the Irish public, but can also link that public with their sworn
enemy. Repeatedly, these accounts insisted that the Irish and English
publics, rather than being divided by national or political affiliations,
formed a community bound by shared sentiment. Such assessments appear to
support the claim that Joseph Roach makes in his reading of Afrocentric
funeral rites in Louisiana, in which he utopically announces, "Such a
performance event opens up, with its formal repetitions, a space for
play. Its genius resides in the very expandability of the procession:
marchers with very different connections to the deceased (or perhaps no
connections at all) join together on the occasion to make connections
with one another."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 By looking closely at MacSwiney's funeral in London, we can discover
 the particular conditions that allowed for the glossy and fantastical
 union between the English and the Irish publics. First, the funeral
 was consistently recounted in ways that acknowledge its power as a
 ritual embedded in a religious and folk tradition; this ritual not
 only requires a demonstration of respect for the deceased, but also
 generates authentic bonds of feeling among its celebrants. As <i>The
 Irish Times</i> noted, even English policemen were observed "wearing
 black gloves as a mark of respect to the dead, standing at attention
 when a coffin, covered with a flag they would call rebel passed by."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Second, the communal mourning in the London streets was attributed
 to the familiar and abiding sense of grief that characterized England
 during the interwar years. Having lost six million young men in World
 War I, the English were familiar with bereavement and well accustomed
 to granting death its public and ceremonial recognition.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 These two conditions encouraged the Irish and English publics to regard
 themselves as in accord against an unsympathetic English government. As
 <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> reported, "The English people, recognising
 how callous and shocking was the final torture inflicted upon the
 victim, felt ashamed of their government and angry with it that it
 should have persisted in the blood-sacrifice and should have thrown
 away the last hopes of a better feeling between two neighboring peoples
 to gratify the self-esteem of petty and posturing politicians."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps this unanimity is best explained by accounts that represented the
funeral as a spectacle in a world rendered ocularcentic by technologies
ranging from print and film to the telescope, a performance (not
unlike MacSwiney's heroic sacrifice) in which all individuals might
participate. Consistently, Irish journalists invoked visual metaphors
to describe the funeral as, for instance, "a remarkable spectacle [that]
created a profound impression in the English capital. Rich and poor and
different creeds and classes united in the tribute of respect."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 The funeral elicited an inherent sense of community among diverse
 peoples and created a "profound impression" largely because it was
 a striking visual scene. The distinctly modernist Wyndham Lewis, who
 was residing in London at the time, described MacSwiney's funeral in
 terms similarly focused on spectacle:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
During the martyrdom of the Lord Mayor of Cork I had several opportunities
of seeing considerable numbers of irish [sic] people demonstrating
among the London crowds. I was never able to distinguish which were
Irish and which were English, however. They looked to me exactly the
same. With the best will in the world to discriminate the orderly groups
of demonstrators from the orderly groups of spectators, and to satisfy
the romantic proprieties on such an occasion, my eyes refused to effect
the necessary separation, that the principle of 'celtism' demanded,
into chalk and cheese. I should have supposed that they were a lot of
romantic english-people pretending to be irish people, and demonstrating
with the assistance of a few priests and pipers, if it had not been that
they all looked extremely depressed, and english-people when they are
giving romance the rein are always very elated.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Lewis describes the mourners as a single community because these
individuals "all looked extremely depressed" so that in a crowd, they
"looked . . . exactly the same." He removes himself from the affect of
this scene, allowing himself&#8212;if not the London crowds&#8212;the
relief of "necessary separation" from mourning. While fascinating for
many reasons, this narrative signals a peculiarity that recurs in other
accounts of the London funeral celebration. Lewis attributes his inability
to distinguish between the English and the Irish in part to the fact
that the mourners "were a lot of romantic english-people pretending
to be irish people." I have argued that this "pretending" is one of
the pleasures afforded by the ambiguity that characterizes MacSwiney's
martyrdom. Here, we see the ways in which the public sought to identify
with this heroic subjectivity without having to endure its particular
suffering. The English and Irish mourners pretended to be not the heroic
martyr himself, but rather a romanticized version of the antimodern Irish
folk. In Lewis's account, this "pretending"&#8212;the way in which both
English and Irish people perform an idealized version of Irishness, along
with a supporting cast of priests and pipers to enhance the authenticity
of the scene&#8212;seems a fairly harmless moment in which the public can
imagine itself taking on the identity of romantic Ireland, dead and gone.

<p>
The coverage of the funeral by <i>The London Times</i> exposes how
these theatrical terms can be used, not simply to encourage unity
among a heterogeneous public but also to defuse the threat to the crown
represented by these crowds. Faced with MacSwiney's revolutionary body,
the English depicted the bodies of the Irish public according to distorted
cultural stereotypes. In one account, the <i>Times</i> described the
crowd attending the procession thus:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In one respect, however, both men and women were wonderfully alike. Both
presented a great variety of Irish types. The Irish peasant was there,
with broad face and uptilted nose; the lantern-jawed, mystical Irishman;
the swarthy, dark-eyed Irishman, own brother to the Spaniard. These and
others could be recognized from their prototypes in Irish story, drama,
and art. Even the Irishman who is said to exist only in the Englishman's
imagination was to be discovered without much search.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Obviously, the particular physical "types" described here limit the
availability of the abstracted heroic Irish identity. Instead, these
descriptions reassert that the Irish community,

<b></b>

while homogeneous, is assembled from the demeaning comic types found
in the English popular theater. Just as in MacSwiney's fictions of
the heroic Irishman, Irish identity can be constructed and then filled
by real individuals. However, according to this account the English,
not the Irish, determine the fictions and realities that define the
Irish public. In doing so, they emphasize the physical characteristics
of these types, disparaging rather than celebrating the bodies found
among the Irish public.

<p>
Press accounts of the London funeral procession revealed the logic
that allows for harmony among this cosmopolitan mourning public. It
could occur because Irish and English observers were able to rewrite the
procession as wholly unthreatening. This was done by theatricalizing the
crowds, but also by describing only those bodies that lacked political
power. Irish press accounts focused not on the virile young Irishmen
who marched in this procession, but instead on "the immense amount of
women who participated in its ranks" and the "extreme youth of the men
taking part in the proceedings, apart from the priests."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 Not surprisingly, <i>The London Times</i>'s description of the funeral
 most egregiously represented the mourners as distinctly apolitical,
 stressing the crowd's "aloofness from all political feeling."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
This account also feminizes the mourning public, further distancing the
marchers from the heroic man they grieve:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Now and then came a woman of good physique who held her head high, as
with defiance. But near her might be a poor old grey-haired creature in
shawl and bonnet, obviously and sadly battered by the stress of life,
and hardly able to go on putting one foot before the other. A band of
girls whose smiles said that politics had not banished other interests
from their heads, would restore the balance a little. [ibid.]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, the female mourners clearly embody and display the weak nature
and easily distracted attention of the Irish.

<p>
The same account reveals that the English represented this political
spectacle as nonthreatening by focusing on the bodies of the Irish
public rather than on the martyred body of MacSwiney. In an interesting
twist, the English press described the marchers' bodies in parts,
remarking that "The mouths that smiled ever so faintly were, however,
rare. Most were hard set, and not a few were writhen" (ibid.). This is
a battle of expression, where a "hard set" or "writhen" face becomes
a weapon&#8212;but not a powerful or threatening one&#8212;in the war
between the English and the Irish. This same account did eventually
turn its attention to the male mourners in the procession, reporting
that the Irish men wore their hats in a similar fashion and therefore
"might have been called uniformed" (ibid.). Thus, while acknowledging the
effort to subvert the English ban on Republican uniforms, this report
simultaneously stresses the nonthreatening nature of the "uniform,"
which consists of "soft" hats worn "over the eyes." Consistently,
the mourners are described as weak and struggling, a description that
reflects the accounts of MacSwiney's body during his final days. In their
identification with this martyr and his withered corpse, the Irish public
represented their struggle as one that culminated in a national public
"sadly battered by the stress of life" and ultimately without a voice
or the energy to do battle&#8212;much like MacSwiney himself.

Dublin: 
<br />
The Corpseless Funeral and the Irish Spirit
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In the Dublin funeral procession held the next day, 29 October, the
struggle to define the iconic body of MacSwiney and the bodies of
those who mourned him continued. From London, MacSwiney's remains and
the mourning party were to travel together to Holyhead, Wales, then
on to Dublin, where Sinn F&eacute;in had planned an extensive funeral
celebration. As the corpse and the family arrived in Holyhead, however,
a surprise decree from the English government announced that MacSwiney's
corpse was to be shipped not to Dublin but directly to Cobh, a port
downriver from Cork. According to a letter hand-delivered to MacSwiney's
family at the docks, English authorities feared that "the landing and
funeral of the Lord Mayor in Dublin may lead to a demonstration in a
political nature."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 The Irish mourners tried to resist this change of plan, with MacSwiney's
 sisters crying in defiance, "You have murdered our brother and you
 are not going to arrest his body."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 But English railway officials and policemen roughly pushed the mourners
 aside; the body was then seized by Black and Tans, placed by harbor
 crane on the English steamer Rathmore, and transported directly to
 Cork accompanied by a cadre of English soldiers.

<p>
The battle over the corpse in Holyhead, which was photographed and
reported in detail by the international press, suggests that at this
moment MacSwiney's body provided the public with a super-charged political
sign. The Irish and English struggled to define the social and political
messages that MacSwiney's corpse would exhibit to the mass public. For
the Irish, it displayed evidence that the English government was so
excessively brutal and corrupt that, in the words of <i>The Freeman's
Journal,</i> "Poor Terence MacSwiney was indeed being harassed, even in
the casket enclosing all that was left of him."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 Meanwhile, the English government, by wrapping the coffin in sackcloth
 and surrounding it with Black and Tans, hoped to label this hunger
 striker a criminal and thus prevent his corpse from becoming an
 illustration of Irish heroism. In an effort to wrest back the power
 to define the meaning of MacSwiney's body, Sinn F&eacute;in proceeded
 as planned with MacSwiney's Dublin funeral on Friday, 29 October,
 the day the corpse was shipped to Cork. The corpseless funeral in
 Dublin revealed the ways in which, following their loss in the battle
 over the body at Holyhead, these Irish mourners reasserted their moral
 superiority over the English and thereby created an ideal Irish public
 whose representations could be circulated across the globe.

<p>
While the accounts of the London funeral relied on theatrical stereotypes
to defuse the power of the Irish mourners, the Dublin accounts employed
a different stereotype of Irishness, that of the spirit&#8212;an ideal
consistently deployed by authors and politicians during the early years
of the Irish Literary Revival. As the contemporary critic Terence Brown
points out, spiritualism was important to the revivalists because it
provided "an image of a universal principle in the Irish world . . . the
manifestation of an objective, communal reality."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 In part, the revivalists imagined this poetic and religious abstraction
 might help to unite diverse Irish individuals into a homogeneous
 national public. For instance, following MacSwiney's death, De Valera
 asserted before yet another American audience the ease with which the
 Irish public could inhabit

<b></b>

MacSwiney's heroic role. He insisted that the Irish could identify with
the iconic body of MacSwiney because all Irish share the same essential
spirit. As he claimed, "Terence MacSwiney did not die to put spirit in
his own people. He knew that they had spirit; that they were waiting
to make sacrifices as he did. . . . There are thousands ready to follow
him that the conscience of the world may be aroused."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
The nation of the spirit offered a salient rallying point because the
pure Irish spirit was consistently represented as the antidote to the
rational, mechanized, urban, and contaminated modern world, a world that
was often coded as English. By invoking this spirit as the ideal, Irish
nationalists could reimagine every loss as a triumph that would supersede
any material victory in life. MacSwiney himself invoked this logic in his
pamphlet on O'Donovan Rossa when he imagined that Rossa had joined other
Irish heroes who had fallen in battle. He called on readers to "think of. . . the noble spirits of the earlier years&#8212;the martyrs of many
a persecution, and the heroes of many a field&#8212;we can imagine them
gathering together to await the issue of the last t. Why, then,
pray either to stand or fall, when either way we are happy?" ("R,"
16). This seems in many ways to be a fatalistic way of imagining the
nation&#8212;Ireland may achieve independence, but real triumph can be
found only in the spiritual afterworld. MacSwiney propounded this belief
throughout <i>Battle-Cries</i> , his collection of poetry. In
poem after poem he insisted that each defeat at the hands of the English
actually signaled ultimate victory for the Irish. As he wrote in his paean
"To the Dead at Eastertide ":


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
'Twas God broke the plan, letting the spirit have sway.
<br />
Ah, how the spirit rose on its wings, and its flight
<br />
Gleamed in the dark, and challenged, and put to affright
<br />
The power material, holding our land in its chains,
<br />
Till the voice of the many, who trembled, that power disdains.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While the Easter Rising revolutionaries may appear to have failed in their
endeavor to free Ireland, according to MacSwiney they succeeded because
their legacy inspired "the many" to revile the English. The real payoff
of sacrifice was not a military or political victory, but the inspiration
offered to the public when the spirit was released from the body.

<p>
In Irish accounts of MacSwiney's death, the spirit was repeatedly invoked
to represent his starvation as a victory that transcended the ability
of the English to capture and imprison him, to determine the route his
corpse must take, and to control the mourners. England might win a battle
of bodies and guns, they might have the material resources to seize
an Irish martyr's corpse and transport it as they wish, but the Irish
could retaliate by insisting on their spiritual superiority and their
belief in MacSwiney's tenet of "no compromise." De Valera assessed the
impact of MacSwiney's hunger strike by claiming, "It is the only field
of battle where we are England's match. It is the spiritual field, and
England's brute force may manacle MacSwiney's body, and they may torture
it, but MacSwiney's spirit will triumph in the ultimate victory of the

<b></b>

cause for which he is dying."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 After death, the body is mere detritus and, without the body to shackle
 it, the spirit can t more effectively for freedom&#8212;an important
 message to convey as the English sailed with MacSwiney's body across
 the Irish Sea. Following MacSwiney's death, one Irish nationalist
 paper included this quotation from a Spanish paper:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
England cannot even say that she has at least one enemy less. For this
enemy&#8212;apart from the spiritual life beyond the grave&#8212;lives
henceforth in the memory of his fellow-citizens, with a life more active,
more effectual, and far more to be feared than his personal life which
has closed. The corpse of MacSwiney, mummified by his seventy-four days'
fast, will be for England an adversary more terrible than an army of
robust and well-armed athletes.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In this passage, the sacrificial removal of MacSwiney's body from
the community gives spiritual life to the community&#8212;a life that
exists in the bodies of those who wish to t England. And the mass
publicity of this body, of the corpse that signifies the spirit's new
life, transforms MacSwiney into a more powerful force than even the live
bodies of "robust and well-armed athletes."

<p>
This invocation of the spirit suggests that the corpse holds revolutionary
potential primarily because it is an indexical sign that MacSwiney's
triumphant spirit has been released. However, when this spiritual ideal
was deployed in Dublin, it appears only to have repressed the energy
generated when the Irish mourners and the English authorities came
into conflict while in Wales. The revolutionary energy that this press
report suggests his "fellow-citizens" might distill from MacSwiney's
spirit&#8212;the spirit that would endow them with "a life more active,
more effectual, and far more to be feared"&#8212;in fact revealed itself
through the widespread harmony among the mourners. Rather than rise
in protest, the public appears here to have embraced the revivalist
sense of the spirit as a tool that can unite and pacify an otherwise
fractured community. The Irish nationalist paper <i>Young Ireland</i>
insisted upon the primacy of this kind of spirit in the following passage:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The empty hearse passing through the City of Dublin was even more symbolic
of the heroic spirit of Ireland's dead than anything else could have
been. In the empty hearse, Dublin and Ireland visualised the spirit
of Irish nationality&#8212;his mortal remains were in charge of the
English forces, but his spirit was in the hearts of the Irish people,
beyond the touch of English defaming hands.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
With the loss of the body, it seems, the Irish gained a nonviolent means
of demonstrating their animus toward the English.

<p>
Only the English press stressed the absence of MacSwiney's body in the
Dublin procession, insisting that "All the arrangements which had been
made for the reception of the body were carried out punctiliously. Only
the central re was absent."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 For the English, the absence of MacSwiney's body mattered in a way
 it appears not to have mattered to the Irish. There are subtle signs,
 however, that his body did in fact

<b></b>

hold an important role in the Irish imagination since, as seen at
Holyhead, it was the very device that displayed the injustice of the
English government. While the shell of MacSwiney's soul was not the
only component that could gather a live public, its trace in the form
of a hearse or the sight of the mourning family could bring Dubliners
into the streets. <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> described the crowds as
though they had assumed the body of their suffering hero:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Dublin remained one quivering nerve of pain and horrified, though
courageous, emotion. The great spirit of the people seemed somehow to
have gone out to keep vigil over the ashes of their dead patriot and
to have left behind it a want, an absence, a strangeness. One felt a
tension brooding over all too deep a source and too long suffering to
display in outward grief.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Like MacSwiney himself, in this account the Dublin mourning public suffers
pain and horror, its spirit flying out of its body. While in London the
Irish public was described as embodying a theatrical mourning public
on display, in Dublin their suffering was described by the Irish press
as too intense "to display in outward grief." The Irish papers engaged
the rhetoric of spectacle not to create a homogeneous mourning public,
but to indicate the difference between the Irish and the English. The
<i>Irish Independent</i> recounted how MacSwiney's family was treated
during the Dublin funeral mass by noting, "An English crowd would have
gawked. It would have watched its every movement. Afterwards it would
have a tale to tell. Grief even is not sacred from the profane eyes of
such people. But Ireland knows sorrow and respects suffering."
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 In this account, the English merely watch suffering and sorrow in order
 (like Wyndham Lewis) to produce a tale, while the Irish are able to
 use spectacle as a means to engage authentic emotion.

Discipline and Mourning
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In <i>The Revolutionist,</i> MacSwiney constructed a narrative in which
Hugh's funeral unites the Irish public and exposes to them the truth
that Home Rule conceals ongoing English oppression. In the early acts,
however, Hugh does not immediately recognize that the nation requires
the public sacrifice of a hero to inspire its citizens. Instead, he is
convinced that oratory will persuade the public to support his political
tenets. Armed with this belief, he embarks on a public speaking tour of
Ireland, apparently presuming that his audiences will be inspired by his
political doctrine if he regresses to a theatrical model of political
display. In doing so, he relies on the feudal mode of publicity that
J&uuml;rgen Habermas describes as "the public sphere as publicity of
representation," a space wherein the virtue and authority of the state
were displayed through the body of the nobleman.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 But this older model of representation fails to unite the modern Irish
 public, and Hugh's travels result only in ravaging his body, the medium
 by which his political stance is conveyed to the audience. Hugh's
 friend Fan insists he stop this campaign of political display because
 his efforts effect little change

<b></b>

among his audiences. Upon his entrance, she insists, Hugh's audiences
"immediately become restive and after a while the usual trouble begins"
(<i>RAP,</i> 117). Hugh disregards Fan's advice and travels to Cork
so that he might inspire another politically enervated audience. When
he returns home, he immediately dies of exhaustion. He unintentionally
sacrifices his life to a fantasy public that he believes can be swayed
by theatrical display, when in fact it becomes clear that the audience
will immediately disperse and not use the energy generated by his public
oration in any meaningful way.

<p>
MacSwiney then posits that the death of the Irish hero and the display of
his body can reveal the "truth" of nationalism to the public and therefore
can unite them in struggle toward a common goal. Hugh's bereaved wife Nora
insists that when all look upon the "beautiful" visage of his corpse, they
will see "the look of the conqueror" and subsequently understand "'Tis we
who are troubled and frightened. There is no fear on his face. . . . Those
who doubted must come and see him dead" (<i>RAP,</i> 135). The fears that,
according to Hugh, were provoked be secret revolutionary societies and
the Catholic church are not visible on the face of the single dead hero;
consequently, it is possible for his corpse to inspire the public to
behave with a similar type of bravery. As Nora insists, "We must leave
him uncovered that everyone may look on his face, that men may wish to
be like him in death&#8212;" (<i>RAP,</i> 135). The mourning public
relates to Hugh's dead body in a very different way from the public
that attended his speaking engagements. Rather than creating "the usual
trouble" as they did at Hugh's speeches, the audience can now identify
with his ideals and retain "his memory always beautiful" (<i>RAP,</i>
136). In MacSwiney's fantasy of death, the display of a corpse unites
Irish citizens in a more permanent and powerful way than the display of
a living political body. The permanent "wish to be like him in death"
engendered in the mourners presents a stark contrast to the transient
friction the audiences experienced when they were exposed to his mortal,
speaking body.

<p>
The funeral celebrations and burial of MacSwiney in his native Cork,
which were held on Sunday, 31 October, initially seem to support the
notion that funereal display can magically unite an otherwise fragmented
public. Accounts of the Cork funeral described the same peaceful formation
of community that attended the rituals in London and Dublin&#8212;with
one notable exception. The <i>London Times</i> mentioned the arrival of
MacSwiney's body in Cork late Saturday afternoon, suggesting that the
corpse would somehow engender rebellious activity among the mourners by
noting that an "air of apprehension throughout the city over what may
happen on the day of the funeral of Lord Mayor MacSwiney seemed to have
superseded the restrained attitude with which the populace received word
of the incident at Holyhead."
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
 The mood in Cork was tense, and when low tides meant that the delivery
 of the body might be delayed, according to <i>The Irish Times,</i>
 "People then began to speculate unkindly about the movements of
 the ship."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 But any tension was thwarted at this particular moment by the church's
 capacity to channel political energy into the passive ritual of
 prayer. As this report continued, "Speculation was checked, however,
 with the call to general prayer, when the churches were unable to hold
 their congregation anxious to join in

<b></b>

supplication for the repose of the soul of their first citizen. On all
sides business was suspended, and the city assumed a solemn Sabbath air"
(ibid.).

<p>
This moment at the dock, wherein public conflict is suppressed in the
interest of prayer, is important because it foregrounds the way in
which the church actively participated in the disciplining of the Irish
public. Anger over the treatment of MacSwiney's corpse was channeled into
prayer for the dead hero's soul. This type of ecclesiastical discipline
was evident throughout the events surrounding MacSwiney's death. At the
moment of his death, MacSwiney's chaplain, Father Dominic, immediately
sent a telegram to the Deputy Lord Mayor of Cork. He advised the city's
citizens to "maintain the same calm, dignified, and noble bearing which
they exhibited on the assassination of [the previous Lord Mayor] Thomas
MacCurtain."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 Notably, Father Dominic alluded to the murder of MacCurtain and his
 peaceful funeral, rather than to the death of Ashe, which as noted
 earlier, prered great violence in Ireland. The <i>Irish Times</i>
 reprinted this letter from Father Cohalan, a Roman Catholic Bishop of
 Cork, which similarly stated that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
for the moment it might appear that the Lord Mayor had died in
defeat. This might be conceded if there were questions merely of
the individual, but it is not true where the issue of the nation is
concerned. We are the weaker nation in combat. Sometimes we tire of
the conflict. Anyhow, the questions of Land, of Local Government, of
Housing, of Education, for a time engage our attention. But periodically
the memory of the martyr's death will remind a young generation of the
freedom of Ireland.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This letter asserts once more that MacSwiney and the nation are conflated
in the national imagination, but in a way that gives emphasis to the
frailty of Ireland and resonates with the London newspapers' earlier
insistence on the weakness of the women and children who composed
the Irish public. Memory here is merely to "remind" the public of
freedom&#8212;not to inspire that public to t for freedom.

<p>
MacSwiney's fantasy, that the mere display of a heroic corpse would
somehow organically unite a fragmented public, revealed itself in Cork
to be only part of the story. In fact, not only the Catholic church
but a variety of institutions consciously worked to manage the behavior
of the public during the funeral celebrations. The most evident source
of discipline was, of course, that of the English military forces. As
discussed, the English government decreed where the body could and could
not go. The government also forced the family to accept the body on their
terms when "A threat by Government officials to take charge of the body. . . and bury it in the barracks yard here led to the family finally
accepting delivery of the remains after they had lain for several hours
on the Customs House dock here tonight."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
 In addition, <i>The London Times</i> reported that the English
 government sought to control the bodies of those who mourned MacSwiney,
 noting that "the competent military authority will take steps to ensure
 that no military display is made, such as the wearing of uniforms
 or Republican armlets or badges, or movement in form of bodies, or
 drilling of any kind. . . . [The funeral] procession must be kept
 down to a reasonable length&#8212;not longer, it is suggested, than
 a quarter of a mile."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Even more powerfully than the colonial military

<b></b>

forces, the tradition of the bourgeois funeral served as a disciplinary
device that superseded religious, racial, and political affiliations and
that called for the formation of a homogeneous mourning community. In
one of the many press accounts of respectful mourning, <i>The Freeman's
Journal</i> reported that when MacSwiney's remains passed through the
city, the Black and Tans and the police saluted in deference to the dead.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>

<p>
It is not particularly surprising to discover that the Catholic church,
the English government, and middle-class mores worked to discipline
the mourners. More remarkable is the fact that Irish nationalists also
helped to pacify the Irish public. Irish nationalists faced legitimate
anxieties regarding the impact of bad behavior on the celebration of
MacSwiney's death, anxieties that were realized at Holyhead. In London
immediately following his brother's death, for instance, Peter MacSwiney
had expressed fears that Republican demonstrations might prevent the
English from allowing the corpse to return to Ireland at all, only to find
those fears almost realized. But even when the Republicans had the body
in tow, they continued to insist that the Irish mourning public behave
in an orderly and peaceful fashion. Members of both the Irish Parliament
and Sinn F&eacute;in asked the public to refrain from violence, while
voicing a concern that "the younger element" or the IRB might disregard
these orders.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
 The nationalist press also colluded in enforcing this kind of
 discipline. <i>The Cork Examiner</i> insisted that "Good-citizenship
 connotes amenability to discipline and order, and respect for the dead
 for whom the community mourns ordains that the last solemn rites shall
 be conducted in a manner befitting the man and the country for which
 he died."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>

<p>
The international press represented the mourning public as homogeneous in
their respect, but there were in fact disruptions: against English orders,
a number of Volunteers mourned in uniform; after the London funeral,
MacSwiney's brown habit was replaced with his Republican uniform; a Gaelic
inscription on the coffin bore a staunchly political message, claiming
MacSwiney was "Murdered by the Foreigner"; and across Ireland, civilians
were arrested for displays of Republicanism. But these ruptures were
small and few. Consistently, descriptions of quiet and orderly behavior
attended the vast crowds who watched the processions staged in London,
Dublin, and Cork. While the Irish and English had overtly restrained
these crowds, clearly MacSwiney's iconic body, a text inscribed with
self-discipline and a refusal to compromise with the English, had become a
point of identification for the Irish public. The Irish saw themselves in
his martyred corpse and exploited that identification to their political
benefit. The mass circulation of the images and accounts of the orderly
Irish public at the funerals challenged one of the powerful binaries
by which the English justified their occupation of Ireland. No longer
could the English government claim it was obligated to enforce order in
a land troubled by the deviant behavior of the "Wild Irish."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
 On the contrary, the Irish public was represented as civilized and
 restrained in the face of England's barbarity.

<p>
Throughout MacSwiney's funeral celebration the Irish were portrayed not
as an unruly mob, but as a well-behaved community. In his widely read
1901 essay, "The Battle of Two Civilizations," the Irish journalist
D. P. Moran cited one of the great

<b></b>

anxieties of the Englishman as a concern over manners. He claimed, "it is
difficult to get the Englishman to admit that there is any civilization
in the world other than British. . . . When he talks of morality, he
thinks only of the British variety, of liberty, progress, good taste, and
so on; he shows somewhat more intelligence on the question of manners,
for here he allows himself to be haunted by the suspicion that his may
after all be only second rate."
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
 The funeral allowed the Irish to display their good behavior before an
 international public and therefore to exacerbate these anxieties. The
 funerals also allowed for a display of manners that spoke well of
 Ireland's capacity to govern itself. The good behavior of the crowds
 could be attributed not only to the innate self-control and respect of
 the civilized Irish people, but&#8212;perhaps more distressing to the
 English&#8212;this behavior could also be attributed to the discipline
 and order enforced by the Irish Volunteers. <i>The Irish Independent</i>
 claimed that "the vast crowds were kept back by cordons of Volunteers,
 who maintained splendid order throughout."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
It is crucial to note, however, that the English were accomplices in
creating MacSwiney's cohesive mourning public. They had cleverly used
the funeral to defuse the revolutionary energy generated by the events
that followed the Easter Rising. When the English government executed
the men involved and then prohibited any funeral celebrations for them,
the Irish public&#8212;who had initially been somewhat frustrated by the
dramatic and futile rebellion&#8212;transformed these poet-rebels into
martyrs and their futile resistance into heroic rebellion. The moment
MacSwiney died, a reporter for <i>The London Times</i> recalled that "the
Republican 'heroes' of 1916 have become already landmarks in Nationalist
Ireland's struggle for freedom"; thus, the correspondent announced,
"I understand that [in MacSwiney's case] the executive authority are
disposed to allow legitimate scope for the expression of public sympathy."
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
 By allowing the Irish public to mourn, the British correctly sensed
 that they could stifle further revolutionary sentiment and political
 insurrection. They may also have been responding to the dangers
 presented by the mass cultural dissemination of MacSwiney's modernist
 martyrdom since, as <i>The Cork Examiner</i> noted, "interference with
 the funeral arrangements would have done them no good with the English
 public, and would have outraged the opinion of every civilised country."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
The widespread celebration of MacSwiney's funerals may have offered the
English an even subtler, but equally pernicious, means of reinforcing
their power over the Irish. At his burial, the nationalist and elegiac
rhetorics surrounding his martyrdom asked the Irish public to identify
further with MacSwiney, to recognize that each of them might be called
to sacrifice for Mother Ireland. Like MacSwiney, with whose heroism
they had explicitly been asked to identify, each Irish citizen would
eventually become a corpse that, as the eulogy proclaimed, "reposes in
the Irish earth of his Motherland."
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
 For all of the changes that modernity had wrought, there remained one
 inescapable truth in the religious promise, "Ashes to ashes, dust to
 dust." Perhaps it was the pervasive display of this inescapable truth
 that most potently repressed significant revolutionary action among the
 Irish during the funeral. Rather than promising a radical break from
 the past, MacSwiney's iconic body, his mass-circulated heroic corpse,
 may have signaled that there can be little change in certain essential
 truths. If

<b></b>

the Irish had deeply internalized their subjection at the hands of
the English&#8212;a subjection enforced over centuries&#8212;then
perhaps MacSwiney's martyred body served to display once more that
the inevitable march of progress&#8212;be it biological, industrial,
or imperial&#8212;could not be stemmed.

<p>
What then was the final revolutionary outcome of the messages MacSwiney's
iconic body wore before the mass public? By internationally distributing
images and written accounts of his death and burial, mass culture
presented his sacrifice as evidence of Irish victimization at the hands
of the English. As MacSwiney had imagined in <i>The Revolutionist</i>
and in his panegyric for O'Donovan Rossa, the Irish heroic corpse
not only exposed English oppression, but also consolidated the Irish
public. Through their identification with MacSwiney's self-disciplined
body, citizens of Ireland, England, and even the United States came
together both as an "imagined community" and as a real audience of
mourners in shared time and space, even if only for a few days. His
martyrdom preceded the English execution of the young Irishman Kevin
Barry, the events of Bloody Sunday, the IRA's flying column attacks
on the Auxiliaries, and the burning of Cork by British forces. These
violent events, all of which occurred in the days and months following
MacSwiney's death, drove the English to the bargaining table, so that
by December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty mandated the creation of an
Irish Free State of twenty-six counties. In the midst of the violence
of the Anglo-Irish War, the accounts of his martyrdom offered the Irish
and international public an alternative mode of revolutionary action. By
presenting Irish bodies as registers of self-discipline in the face of
English oppression, a new form of heroism was established. MacSwiney's
modernist martyrdom meant that his self-inflicted death could be
interpreted not just as another in a transhistorical legacy of sacrifice
for a noble principle, but also as a public relations coup bringing the
Irish closer to independence.

This fantasy was in no way original to MacSwiney or the Irish
nationalists. In their analysis of death rituals, the anthropologists
Peter Metcalfe and Richard Huntington insist that any death unites a
community, but that historically the death of a royal person&#8212;or
here, the Irish nationalist hero&#8212;fuses a community even more
strongly because the funeral may be regarded as "part of a political
drama in which many people have a stake." See Peter Metcalfe and Richard
Huntington, <i>Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary
Ritual</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 134. If, as
Lauren Berlant argues, the living body of a celebrity urges individuals
to shed their own bodies (see note 8), then a royal funeral takes
this one step further because, according to Metcalfe and Huntington,
"a royal funeral, ef, or corpse becomes a highly condensed set of
symbols directly representing every one of the deaths of all the people
of the realm" .

Like many nationalists in early twentieth-century Ireland, MacSwiney's
political and literary careers were intertwined. He was one of the
founders of the Cork branch of the Irish Volunteers, and he was to have
been second in command of the Easter Rising in Cork and Kerry. When
Thomas MacCurtain was killed by British soldiers in March 1920,
MacSwiney took his place, both as Lord Mayor of Cork and as the head
of the Cork Brigade of the IRA. As a literary re, he helped form
both the Celtic Literary Society in Cork and the Cork Dramatic Society;
he authored <i>Battle-Cries</i> , a book of poems dedicated to
the "Dead at Eastertide"; and he published four plays. Furthermore,
MacSwiney's work in <i>Fianna Fail,</i> the revolutionary newspaper he
edited, reflected his commitment to Ireland's cultural and political
life. Biographies recounting his martyrdom and the political career
that preceded it reveal his striking investment in the body as a
means through which to display revolutionary political ideals before
a live public. See Moirin Chavasse, <i>Terence MacSwiney</i> (Dublin:
Clonmore and Reynolds, 1961); Francis Costello, <i>Enduring the Most:
The Life and Death of Terence MacSwiney</i> (Kerry: Brandon Books,
1995); P. S. O'Hegarty, <i>A Short Memoir of Terence MacSwiney</i>

MacSwiney was charged with a variety of crimes, including the possession
of a Royal Irish Constabulary cypher key that allowed the Republicans
to decode British messages and documents (pledging allegiance to
Dail &Eacute;ireann) that were "likely to cause disaffection to his
Majesty." See Chavasse, <i>Terence MacSwiney,</i> 145. He was tried on
16 August and was found guilty and transported to Brixton Prison the
following day.

Oliver MacDonagh has argued that Irish political culture is defined by its
efforts to conflate the past and the present, by its allegiance to "the
contemporaneity of the past." See Oliver MacDonagh, <i>States of Mind: A
Study of the Anglo-Irish Conflict 1780-1980</i> (London: Allen and Unwin,
1983), 9. Similarly, Terry Eagleton argues that Irish political culture
blends "the archaic with the absolutely contemporary." See Terry Eagleton,
<i>Heathcliff and the Great Hunger: Studies in Irish Culture</i> (London:
Verso, 1995), 279. In his discussion of Irish modernization, Luke Gibbons
argues that "idealizations of rural existence, the longing for community
and primitive simplicity are the product of an urban sensibility" and thus
mask the real modernizing influences in nostalgia. See Luke Gibbons, "The
Myth of Modernization in Irish Culture," in <i>Transformations in Irish
Culture</i> (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1996), 85.

"Peter MacSwiney's Views," <i>The New York Times,</i> 26 October 1920,
7. During the early twentieth century fasting had become a tool for modern
mass political purposes and was a particularly salient one for MacSwiney
in light of the long shadow cast by the Irish Famine of the mid-nineteenth
century. According to Joseph Lee, this famine was the moment in which
the Irish recognized themselves not as powerless objects of God's will,
but as modern political subjects oppressed by the English who could exert
influence over the government through their vote. Evidence that the modern
public perceived hunger strikes as efficacious acts of resistance may
be found in the series of well-publicized strikes staged in England and
Ireland during the early twentieth century. This revisionist depiction
of the hunger strike&#8212;as an action directed toward the mass public
in order to elicit agency from them&#8212;was so powerful and pervasive
that the nationalist paper <i>The Watchword</i> announced, "From the
earliest times the hunger strike has been made use of for the purpose
of bringing public opinion or odium to bear on cases of injustice." See
"The Hunger Strike in History," <i>The Watchword,</i> 23 October 1920, 3.

Patrick Pearse and the other rebels of 1916 offered the public a
sacrificial model that embodied Cuchulain and other heroes of Gaelic
mythology, Christ (in ultimate victory through self-abnegation), and

Davis). For helpful accounts of the Easter Rising, see <i>Revising the

In 1917, Sinn F&eacute;in strengthened the link between nascent political
consciousness and hunger by celebrating the death of Ashe, the president
of the IRB who was imprisoned for his involvement in the Easter Rising and
died at Mountjoy Prison. Ashe's funeral procession drew over 40,000 people
and successfully turned their attention from the failure of the Easter
Rising and Sinn F&eacute;in's lack of an articulate national policy
to English oppression. His funeral was imagined as a covert display
of native military presence, an opportunity for the IRB to demonstrate
that they were a military force to be reckoned with, a message conveyed
through the succinct eulogy that Michael Collins offered after a volley
of gunshot was fired at Ashe's graveside: "Nothing additional remains to
be said. That volley which we have just heard is the only speech which it
is proper to make over the grave of a dead Fenian." See Ulick O'Connor,

to simple racial prejudice, failing to acknowledge the role of class and
religion in English prejudice. See R. F. Foster, "Paddy and Mr. Punch,"

<p>
Down with professors!
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 The slogan resounds throughout the early manifestos of Italian Futurism,
 underscoring the movement's two-pronged assault on the historicist cult
 of the past and the positivist culture of scientific rationality. From
 the front page of <i>Le ro,</i> the 1909 Founding Manifesto had
 promised not only to destroy the institutions of memory ("museums,
 libraries, and academies of all sorts") but also to free Italy "from its
 fetid cancer of professors, archeologists, ciceros and antiquarians"
 (<i>TIF,</i> 11). Five years later, in the spring of 1914, this
 polemic was alive and well, as attested by a mock funeral for "the
 pass&eacute;ist philosopher" Benedetto Croce held in the Sprovieri
 Gallery in Rome. A large papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; head "sculpted by
 means of slaps" was paraded about the gallery on a worm-eaten book
 while the painter Giacomo Balla rang a cowbell and emitted the sounds
 <i>nyeeet-nyeeeet</i>&#8212;a hybrid of sheep bleats and Russian
 "nays." For his part, Marinetti pronounced a funeral oration that
 justified the sculptor's violent technique by citing the professor's
 rotten breath and tongue, the potatoes and onions fermenting in his
 brain, and his capacity to kill genius and to stink up even the divine
 Roman springtime. The stench was such, he claimed in his valediction,
 that, in order not to wretch, he needed to light a cigarette. (A
 cigarette was lit and the attack of nausea was nipped in the bud.)
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
Even when World War I was five years away, there was never any doubt
that the "fetid cancer" that was filling Italian minds with potatoes
and onions was a Teutonic export, even if championed

<b></b>

by the likes of Croce. The Futurist offensive against the old Italy thus
necessarily had a northern neighbor in its sights: "We combat Germanic
culture, not in order to defend Latin culture, but in order to defeat
these two equally noxious cultures in the name of the contemporary Italian
creative genius. Our answer to [Theodor] Mommsen and Benedetto Croce is
the Italian <i>scugnizzo</i> [street-urchin]" (<i>TIF,</i> 336). In the
place of the Neapolitan germanophile, Futurism embraced the legendary
Italian double of the Brazilian <i>meninho da rua</i>: a trickster,
lawbreaker, and troublemaker, and a street-guerrilla who lived for the
present alone, whose laboratory and library were the modern urban jungle.

<p>
Marinetti was, of course, a most improbable <i>scugnizzo</i>, having
earned a degree in law from the University of Genoa, gained acclaim in
France for works such as <i>La Conqu&ecirc;te des &eacute;toiles</i>
 and the Jarry-esque <i>Le Roi Bombance</i> , and having
inherited a considerable fortune from his father Enrico.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 But with the <i>scugnizzo</i>-ideal firmly in mind and armed with
 abundant street smarts, he did everything within his powers to promote
 the fame and fortune of the Futurist movement from the moment of its
 birth to the time of his death in 1944 at the age of 68 (the result
 of a heart condition, developed in the wake of a voluntary stint on
 the Russian front). Among his most characteristic techniques was the
 meticulous and systematic compilation of press clippings, essays,
 and books concerning Futurism and the reception of his work. Whether
 such materials were favorable or unfavorable mattered less than
 their immediate use-value or potential to be recycled in movement
 publications. Much as in today's film advertisements, Marinetti
 would lift the most tenuous sliver of praise from a wholly negative
 context in order to use it for promotional purposes. In this manner his
 Futurist propaganda machine abrogated all of the movement's founding
 principles in the process of documenting its conquests. Words of praise
 from eminent res, however faint, or the right sort of shocked
 and hidebound words of criticism were viewed as equally valuable in
 buttressing Futurism's claim that it represented the central force of
 renewal in contemporary life. Little did it matter that they should
 issue forth from the most fetid potato- and onion-brained members of
 the professoriate, such as Croce, Mommsen, or even Karl Vossler.

<p>
In the spring of 1914, probably during one of his German speaking tours,
Marinetti became aware that, in the course of extending the scope of
his already renowned <i>Italienische Literaturgeschichte</i> (1900; 2nd
ed. 1908), Vossler had given a series of public lectures at the Frankfurt
<i>Freies deutsches Hochstift</i> in which he had concluded with a brief
discussion of Futurism's impact on the Italian literary scene.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Vossler occupied the chair in Romance Philology at the University of
 Munich as of 1911 and, not being an expert on contemporary literature,
 had been forced to scramble. (He confessed to Croce that "I'm reading
 fast and furiously when I can so as to bone up a bit.")
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Well received, the lectures were expanded and published in May of that
 same year as <i>Italienische Literatur der Gegenwart von der Romantik
 zum Futurismus.</i> The book version consisted in a chronologically
 ordered sequence of case studies extending from Alessandro Manzoni to
 Giovanni Pascoli to Gabriele D'Annunzio, and closed not with Futurism,
 but with an entirely new coda: a full chapter dedicated to Croce,

<b></b>

the great "renewer of aesthetics and literary criticism" to whose critical
writings, Vossler proclaimed, "I owe almost everything."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 (The treatment of Futurism, expanded to ten paragraphs, was wedged into
 the conclusion of the D'Annunzio chapter.) This Crocean teleology,
 intended from the start but absent from the lectures, may seem
 unpromising from a Futurist perspective. Not reading German and
 acquainted only with the book's title, Marinetti didn't know better. But
 he knew that Vossler was a re of enormous prestige thanks to the
 recent appearance in Italian translation of his <i>Positivismus und
 Idealismus in der Sprachwissenschaft</i>  and of his commented
 edition of Dante's <i>Commedia.</i>
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 In the first of these, a ferocious antipositivist polemic, combined with
 a claim that individual artistic creation represented the essence of
 human language (and, therefore, the basis for all linguistic inquiry),
 might well have seemed in harmony with the values of a movement that,
 despite its commitment to industrial civilization and mechanical
 reproduction, never tired in asserting the superiority and autonomy
 of art. In any event, Marinetti mobilized in the usual manner, dashing
 off a letter with accompanying Futurist enclosures.

Vossler's reply is preserved in Yale University's Beinecke Rare Books
Library. Dated 28 July 1914, the fateful day of Austria-Hungary's
declaration of war against Serbia, it starts by staging its own little
funeral:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
My dear Marinetti,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have asked my publisher to send you a copy of the little volume that
interests you [<i>Italienische Literatur der Gegenwart</i>]. But you
will surely be disappointed because it treats Futurism not as a new
beginning but rather as the final expression of a movement that starts
with Romanticism. In short, I'm sorry to have to say so, but it judges
Futurism from a pass&eacute;ist standpoint. As a matter of fact, my
view is that Futurism has within it something that has already come and
gone, something dead or, better, still-born: to wit, the same ironic and
playful sense of humor [<i>umorismo</i>] with respect to the real that,
though stale as could be, can be found in the Romantics, especially the
German Romantics. The latter informs Schelling's theory and program and
the art and style of the Schlegels, Hoffman, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am deeply persuaded that life is anything but a game. Which is to say
that I <i>believe</i> in life and that I approach it with the utmost
seriousness. I observe that Futurism also has a serious, vital side, fed
principally by the sense of tedium it feels when confronted by aesthetes
and dilettantes like Anatole France and the Dannunzians. It won't be easy
to kill them off or to bury them, but if anyone can accomplish the task,
I think you are the ones. The fiercest humor [<i>umorismo</i>], the most
biting irony, the most gleeful kicks in the shin are all befitting of
and appropriate to this labor of destruction. But when you do battle
against everything old, even libraries, I'm no longer with you. Modern
life is a tree that needs to push ever higher and higher and, for this
very reason, it needs to plunge ever more robust roots into the soil of
tradition, into the past. We professors of history are the hidden heels,
the underground veins, the subtle threads that take suck and nourishment
from these roots. And even among you Futurists, there is a tendency
towards historical recurrence, towards a return to so-called "prehistoric"
primitive art, especially in the domain of painting. Your proposals and
efforts to create words-in-freedom and the wireless imagination also
involve a return to a type of art that has something antediluvian about
it ("antediluvian" in the best sense of the word). It is this strain of
primitivism in your art that bodes best for the future, in my view. Go
back to the art of Negroes and

<b></b>

gorillas. Why not? To justify your style you claim that poets and
audiences are old friends who understand one another with a mere
wink or nod: without syntax, without connective ties [<i>fili</i>],
without logical argumentation [<i>ragionamenti</i>]. True, but only
of the primitive state that you wish to revive. It is also true that
pure lyricism has no need for temporal perspective or for spatial
proportion. If there's a defect in your program, it consists in the fact
that it remains a program (or, rather, that it strives to present itself
as such). Techniques can't simply be decreed. Every poet has to find
and elaborate his own. But at its core your program itself is a form
of poetry, which is to say song, a song about song [<i>un canto sopra
un canto</i>]. The theories that a song contains cannot be discussed;
they can only be savored. This is all I have to say at this point. Maybe
some day or other I'll write an interpretive article on Futurism. But
my ideas aren't limpid or sober enough quite yet. After all, a high
degree of sobriety is required to interpret the enthusiasms, mysticisms
and intoxications of your movement. Thus far no one has attained such
sobriety and, unsurprisingly, you yourselves least of all, because poets
are fated to remain ineffable enigmas to themselves.

<p align="right">
Yours sincerely,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    K. Vossler

<p>
Though the letter opens with harsh criticisms comparable to those found
in the 1914 volume&#8212;the book reduces D'Annunzio to a mere master of
commercial self-advertisement and casts the Futurists as merry pranksters
[<i>Spassv&ouml;gel</i>] who have taken the "decomposition of real
consciousness into the dream of art . . . to the ultimate extreme of
absurdity"&#8212;it closes on a friendlier note.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 A nadir is marked with Vossler's identification of Futurist
 words-in-freedom poetry with "Negro art" and gorilla grunts. But
 then comes a sudden swerve towards recognition that Marinetti's
 theorizations are themselves meta-lyrics (literally "a song <i>on
 top of</i> a song"): lyrics that perhaps are not exalted enough to be
 treated as philosophical utterances, yet tasty all the same.

<p>
Just how amicable is this swerve? Only slightly so. A passage from
<i>Italienische Literatur der Gegenwart</i> suggests that the conflict
that structures Vossler's letter is not reducible to that over whether
it is Crocean pass&eacute;ists or Marinettian Futurists who are truly
still-born, or simply to the opposition between humor and seriousness,
drunken poets on a destructive rampage and sober professors of history
patiently absorbing the juices of tradition at the root of the tree of
modern life. Rather, such literary skirmishes appear enfolded within
the impending Franco-Italian/German hostilities. The seriousness and
sobriety repeatedly celebrated in the letter are distinctively German
attributes, attributes that must be defended because, according to the
book, they are under attack: the jocular Marinetti, Vossler insists,
"writes French better than Italian" and "considers <i>the serious German
people</i> an inferior race."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Paradoxically, this explicit apology for German sobriety and implicit
 critique of Franco-Italian insobriety admits some leakage. Whereas
 in the book Futurism's predecessors were only said to be French and
 English, in the letter they become (presumably unserious) Germans
 of the ilk of Schelling, Schlegel, and Hoffman or of the oddballs
 [<i>Querk&ouml;pfe</i>] that cheered Marinetti in Berlin.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Whereas in the book the Futurists were the unabashed advocates of
 turning hospitals and cemeteries into night clubs, in the letter they
 too, despite themselves, are granted a slice of the <i>Sachertorte</i>
 of seriousness. Finally, whereas

<b></b>

in the book the philosopher of language was the stolid champion of the
"hard and modest labor" that he attributes to the "greater and better
portion of the [Italian] populace" that, unlike the Futurists, is immune
to "megalomaniacal pan-Italian imperial dreams," in the letter he himself
seems to have succumbed to the ambient mirth.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Despite the fact that he takes life "terribly seriously," his ideas
 are not (as yet) so limpid and sober as to permit the drafting of an
 interpretive article.

<p>
Limpidity and sobriety never came. The essay in question was never
written.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Nor did Marinetti ever find a use for Vossler's criticism or praise. The
 exchange proved something of a draw, though; with the outbreak of the
 Great War, tipsy gorillas assumed a place of honor atop the tree of
 modern life.

The poet Radiante [Revillo Cappari] and the painter [Fortunato] Depero

arms made of rope and hands made of paper. The painter Balla, disguised as

beating a cowbell, intoning in a nasal voice: <i>nyeeet-nyeeet</i>.

The Italian original reads:




<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Carissimo Marinetti,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ho dato ordine al mio editore che vi spedisca una copia del volumetto
che vi interessa. Ma sar&agrave; una delusione per voi, perch&egrave;
il futurismo vi &egrave; considerato solo come il punto finale d'un
movimento che comincia col romanticismo, non come principio d'un altro
movimento. Insomma, vi &egrave; giudicato, mi dispiace doverlo dire,
passatisticamente. Infatti, mi pare che c'&egrave; qualche cosa nel
futurismo che &egrave; gi&agrave; passata, gi&agrave; morta ossia nata
morta ed &egrave; specialmente quell'umorismo ironico e giocarellone
dinnanzi alla realt&agrave;, cosa stantivissima che si trova tale e quale
nei romantici specialmente tedeschi; vi si trova come teoria e programma
nello Schelling e come arte e stile negli Schlegel, Hoffman, ecc.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Io sono profondamente convinto che la vita &egrave; tutt'altra cosa che
un gioco, cio&egrave; <i>credo</i> alla vita e la prendo terribilmente sul
serio. Vedo che anche nel futurismo c'&egrave; il lato serio, cio&egrave;
vitale, ed &egrave;, prima di tutto, il tedio che voi provate contro
gli esteti e dilettanti, contro gli Anatole France e i D'Annunziani; e
se c'&egrave; qualcosa che riesce ad ammazzarli e seppellirli&#8212;cosa
difficile assai&#8212;credo che siate voi. In questo lavoro di distruzione
ci pu&ograve; essere e sta benissimo il pi&ugrave; feroce umorismo, la
pi&ugrave; sarcastica ironia, i pi&ugrave; divertenti calci. Ma se ve la
pigliate con qualsiasi cosa vecchia e perfino con le biblioteche, non ci
sto pi&ugrave;. La vita moderna &egrave; un albero che deve spingersi
sempre pi&ugrave; in alto e appunto perci&ograve; deve sprofondare
le sue radici anche pi&ugrave; forti nel suolo della tradizione, del
passato. Noi professori di storia siamo i tacchi nascosti sotterranei
fili e filetti succhianti e poppanti della radice. E in voi futuristi
stessi c'&egrave; una tendenza al ricorso storico, alle arti primitive
cosidette preistoriche, specie nella pittura. Nel programma e tentativo
vostro delle parole in libert&agrave; e dell'immaginazione senza fili vi
&egrave; un ritorno ad un genere d'arte che ha dell'antediluviano (sia
inteso in senso buono). Ed &egrave; appunto questa primitivit&agrave;
della vostra arte che me ne sembra il migliore augurio. Tornate pure
all'arte dei negri e dei gorilla, non sar&agrave; male. Voi dite per
giustificare il vostro stile che il poeta e il pubblico son amici
vecchi che s'intendono con un cenno, senza sintassi, senza fili, senza
ragionamenti. Ci&ograve; &egrave; vero per lo stato primitivo che volete
ripristinare. Ed &egrave; anche vero che il lirismo puro non ha bisogno
di prospettive temporali n&egrave; di proporzioni spaziali. Se c'&egrave;
un torto nel vostro programma &egrave; di essere un programma, cio&egrave;
di darsene la sembianza. La tecnica non si pu&ograve; proclamare; ogni
poeta deve trovarsela ed inventarsela da se. Ma in fondo il vostro
programma &egrave; una poesia, &egrave; un canto anch'esso, un canto
sopra un canto. Le teorie contenute in un canto non si discutono, si
gustano. Ecco quanto saprei per ora dirvi. Pu&ograve; essere che un giorno
o l'altro io scriva un articolo interpretativo sul Futurismo. Ma finora le
mie idee non sono ancora abbastanza nette e sobrie. Perch&egrave; bisogna
essere molto sobrio per poter interpretare gli entusiasmi, i misticismi
e le ebbrezze del vostro movimento. Finora mi pare che nessuno abbia
raggiunto questa sobriet&agrave; e voi stessi, come &egrave; naturale,
meno di tutti poich&egrave; il poeta &egrave; a se stesso il pi&ugrave;
ineffabile enigma.

<p align="right">
Abbiatemi vostro,
<br />

"Commercial advertisement [<i>Gesch&auml;ftsreklame</i>], an area in
which D'Annunzio is a true master, disorients the public and renders
ever more difficult the task of separating the good from the merely
showy [<i>des Gediegenen vom Flittergold</i>]" (<i>ILG,</i> 116). "Such
an estrangement of art from life, or better, such a decomposition of
consciousness of the real [<i>Wirtlichkeitsbewusstseins</i>] into the
artist's dream of art [<i>K&uuml;nstlertraum</i>] is today being taken
to the ultimate extreme of absurdity by the Futurists. Therein lies,
if I am not mistaken, the task, the raison d'&ecirc;tre and the purpose
[<i>Ernst</i>] of these pranksters" (<i>ILG,</i> 120).

<p>
<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
The original phrases are "der besser Franz&ouml;sisch als Italienisch
kann" (<i>ILG,</i> 120) and "<i>das ernste Volk</i> der Deutschen"
(<i>ILG,</i> 122; emphasis added). Vossler repeatedly levels the same
accusation at the Italian press in his subsequent correspondence with
Croce: "Here the grandest of spectacles is unfolding: the reawakening of
a nation of seventy million, united to a man, from the emperor on down
to the humblest rag picker. The ideas of modern socialism are merging
with those of military feudalism. Colossal social relief measures
are being implemented. Every individual lives for the collective, for
the fatherland. And to all this Italy closes its eyes, lending an ear
instead to the humanitarian phrases and empty sentimentalism of the
French." Vossler to Croce, 24 September 1914, <i>CCV,</i> 185. Vossler
published an open letter in <i>Il Giornale d'Italia</i> 3 (19 October
1914) making precisely this same point.

<p>
<a name="FOOT12" href="#REF12">12</a>.
The original reads: "Darum h&auml;lt Marinetti das ernste Volk
der Deutschen f&uuml;r eine inferiore Rasse, obgleich er in Berlin
Querk&ouml;pfe genug gefunden hat, die ihm zujauchzen" (<i>ILG,</i> 122).

<p>
<a name="FOOT13" href="#REF13">13</a>.
"This type of reaction [i.e. the revolt of the Futurists] is hopeless. One
can't escape boredom by means of games and fussing about [<i>Spielerei
und Getue</i>], but rather only through hard and modest labor. Such is the
toil being generously undertaken by the greater and better portion of the
[Italian] populace" (<i>ILG,</i> 123). "[Italy is summoned] to sell off
its art and museums to purchase instead cannons, aircraft, destroyers
and dirigibles. . . . This is how Futurism tumbles and, thanks to its
megalomaniacal pan-Italian imperial dreams, falls into the void" (ibid).

<p>
<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
Vossler returned to the topic of Futurism only in cursory fashion. The
expanded third edition of his <i>Italienische Litteraturgeschichte</i>
contains a new pair of final paragraphs culled from <i>Italienische
Literatur der Gegenwart</i> and concludes with the remark that "Italy's
entry into the World War was for these giddy individuals the biggest
party they had ever attended" ("Der Eintritt Italiens in dern Weltkrieg
war f&uuml;r diese Taumelnden das gr&ouml;sste Fest ihres Lebens"). See
Karl Vossler, <i>Italienische Litteraturgeschichte</i> (Leipzig:
G. J. G&ouml;schen, 1900; revised 3rd ed., 1916), 153. He also made
only minimal changes to the second edition of <i>Letteratura italiana
contemporanea dal romanticismo al futurismo</i> (trans. Tomaso Gnoli
[Naples: Ricciardi, 1916; revised 2nd ed., 1922]), principally in the
form of a reference to Marinetti's 1921 "Manifesto of Tactilism" and to
the ongoing productivity in Italian culture of "futurism, expressionism,
dadaism and other programmatic extravagances" (142, 147).

<blockquote>
<!--_epigraph-->
There were two famous phrases about the time: that life had become
better, more joyous, and that Mayakovsky was and remained the best and
most talented poet of our Soviet epoch. For the second phrase I thanked
the author of these words with a personal letter, because they freed me
from the exaggeration of my own significance that had begun to afflict
me in the middle of the 1930s. I love life and am satisfied with it. I do
not need its additional gilding. I do not imagine life outside of mystery
and obscurity, life in the mirrored gleam of the exhibition window.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mayakovsky began to be cultivated forcefully, like potatoes in the time
of Catherine the Great. This was his second death. He is not guilty of it.

<!--_a-head-->
Mayakovsky and Canonization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In the late 1950s, Pasternak wrote perhaps the most succinct, widely
quoted epilogue to Vladimir Mayakovsky's biography and career. In
commenting on the phrase that transformed Mayakovsky into the Soviet
State poet, Pasternak centers on how these words affected his own
consciousness and poetic activity. He responds to the author of this
phrase personally, in writing, stressing the effect of this proclamation
on his own self-image as a poet. However, in addition to revealing his
personal reaction, Pasternak also hints at the extent of the larger
cultural process

<b></b>

that created the new Soviet Mayakovsky. He implies that Stalin's
praise of Mayakovsky was inseparable from the statement of optimism
and victory in Stalin's other famous proclamation from 1935: "Life has
become better, life has become more joyous." As Pasternak suggests,
Mayakovsky's "canonization" was tied to profound changes in Soviet
cultural life in the 1930s.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
The phrase to which Pasternak refers is Stalin's famous statement about
Mayakovsky published in <i>Pravda</i> on 5 December 1935.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Stalin's proclamation appeared in a front-page editorial that declared
 Mayakovsky "the best, most talented poet of our Soviet epoch," and
 added that "indifference to his memory or his works is a crime."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Remembering how this phrase affected him, Pasternak also hints at the
 implications these words carried for the community at large and for
 the control of literary value. In describing the state "cultivation"
 of Mayakovsky, Pasternak inverts the usual implications of the
 agricultural simile. Mayakovsky was propagated like potatoes, but
 instead of bringing nourishment and life, this cultivation brings
 poetic death to Mayakovsky, and presumably to those who were "fed"
 him. Paradoxically, however, the process gives Pasternak life by
 preventing him from becoming the object of this deadly cultivation;
 Pasternak implies that this statement about Mayakovsky allowed him to
 remain both a living man and a living poet.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Within the context of the 1930s, Pasternak's choice of simile hints
 at how the state applied nonliterary projects and plans to literary
 life; it also evokes the enforced collectivization of the 1930s,
 and the agricultural disaster that followed. In the end, however,
 Pasternak is writing not to describe this process,

<b></b>

but to condemn it morally, while absolving Mayakovsky from blame for his
Soviet afterlife. In the sentence "He is not guilty of it," Pasternak
portrays the official Soviet canonization of Mayakovsky as a criminal
act or a moral transgression. He writes to vindicate Mayakovsky by
emphasizing the difference between the living poet and his objectified
image in Soviet culture.

<p>
Most non-Soviet scholars who have discussed Mayakovsky's Soviet
"canonization" have done so in order to judge him; they either absolve
Mayakovsky of guilt, as Pasternak does, or blame him for his posthumous
Soviet myth.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 However, the need to take a position on Mayakovsky's responsibility for
 his "second death" has inhibited study of how precisely this "second
 death" came about. Few scholars have attempted to analyze the Soviet
 cultivation and circulation of the poet's image, a process that, as
 Pasternak implies, centered on the propagation of Mayakovsky himself
 rather than his works. Soviet scholarship could not critically analyze
 the canonization of Mayakovsky. Many of the post-Glasnost writings
 on Mayakovsky in Russia have a sensationalist "true crime" flavor,
 focusing either on his romantic and sexual relationships, or on the
 gory details of his death; other works have resurrected older arguments
 against Mayakovsky's companions, Osip and Lili Brik.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Little, however, has been written about the institutions that
 "cultivated" the new Mayakovsky in the Soviet Union after 1935.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
The context of Stalin's proclamation hints at the multileveled process
of cultivation that would create the new image of Mayakovsky. Stalin's
comment fixed Mayakovsky's official cultural and literary value, resolving
the struggle between Pasternak supporters and Mayakovsky supporters that
had come to a head in 1934 at the Soviet Writer's Union Congress.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Bukharin's speech at the Congress had praised Mayakovsky but declared,
 "the time for agitprop in the Mayakovsky style has passed."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 The <i>Pravda</i> article directly responded to Bukharin in declaring
 that Mayakovsky's work "was and

<b></b>

remains timely." Stalin's pronouncement came in the midst of discussions
that Soviet poetry, unlike prose, was poor and underdeveloped.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 In fact, the overall tone of the <i>Pravda</i> article about Mayakovsky
 was antagonistic, not so much praising him as denouncing his real
 and potential opponents. Even the phrasing of Stalin's remark implied
 that contemporary Soviet poetry was of comparatively low quality. The
 remark about Mayakovsky, then, was specifically targeted at the
 intelligentsia. At the same time, Stalin's words were published
 in <i>Pravda</i> for its general audiences. From the beginning,
 the change in Mayakovsky's status was framed and promoted not only
 as a directive to writers but also as a declaration for the entire
 nation. In this period, all types of readers looked to <i>Pravda</i>
 for signals on shifts in Party policy and attitudes toward the arts.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 Stalin's remark, therefore, was both a professional and general
 directive, one that assigned value but did little to create or define
 Mayakovsky's image in Soviet culture.

<p>
Stalin's words may have resolved the debate over Mayakovsky's
significance, but they raised a series of problems for both the party and
the literary intelligentsia that would create a new Mayakovsky. Unlike
Pushkin and other classic poets who were newly "Sovietized" in the 1930s,
Mayakovsky had been dead only five years. Many people still held strong
opinions about his work and retained vivid memories of his person. To
create and affirm a unified, cohesive myth, the state needed to overcome
a number of factors that complicated representations of Mayakovsky
as an exemplary Soviet poet. These included the existence of many
living contemporaries, Mayakovsky's Futurist past, his unconventional
cohabitation with the Briks, his many affairs, his bad reputation among
the masses, and last (but not least) his suicide. One particularly
challenging problem was Mayakovsky's widespread reputation as an
iconoclast and a Futurist, a poet connected with "decadent" Western
literary movements. A worker's comment from 1928 shows the extent to which
Mayakovsky had come to represent incomprehensible, <i>foreign</i> poetry:
"they [modern poets] write completely in the new way, and sometimes we
don't understand anything, because we are used to speaking and reading in
Russian, but some poet speaks in Mayakovsky (<i>po&#8212;Maiakovski</i>),
and we can't understand a thing."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
In affirming Mayakovsky's new position in Soviet literature, Stalin
expressed the party's new degree of involvement in literary matters.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 The <i>Pravda</i> article that quoted Stalin's comments was published
 alongside a special editorial that declared the party's new authority
 over literary criticism and literary activity in general:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The party will devote special attention to questions of criticism and
attract to this work the best literary and scientific powers . . . the
central committee has issued a special directive on criticism and
bibliography. <i>Pravda</i> will analyze questions of artistic literature,
and periodically publish 'literary pages' (<i>litstranitsy</i>)."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Appearing on <i>Pravda</i>'s first literary page, the declaration of
Mayakovsky's new "Soviet classic" status expressed a new party involvement
in questions of literature and literary studies.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 These literary pages would become an important part of <i>Pravda</i>
 during the next few years; in particular, they would mark literary
 anniversaries for the public.

<b></b>

These pages often contained a combination of essays, poems, and other
genres commemorating an author's birth or death. The literary pages
became part of <i>Pravda</i> at the same time that the State began to
celebrate "great" writers' anniversary dates with commemorative texts and
events, most famously in the massive, state-organized "Pushkin jubilee"
of 1937. Stalin's evaluation of Mayakovsky thus inaugurated a new era,
one in which the party took explicit control over literary institutions
and publications, as well as the definition of literary and cultural
value. Stalin's statement about Mayakovsky was part of a larger merger
of political and cultural authority that would be expressed most clearly
in the state sponsored celebrations for literary res, particularly
poets, in the late 1930s. Mayakovsky himself would be celebrated in 1940
with a large, state controlled commemoration of the tenth anniversary
of his death.

<p>
The diverse events and publications of this celebration can be understood
as a "commentary" on Mayakovsky, one that guided interpretation of his
life and work. As Rachel Schmidt has shown, a literary classic does not
simply reflect a certain set of values, but is a complex text containing
diverse, opposing ideals.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Because a text may not necessarily pass on the values of the canonizing
 authority, critical commentary, notes, visual images, and other devices
 are produced in order to guide the reader and determine how the classic
 text will be interpreted. In the Soviet Union, literary celebrations
 became the occasion for producing these kinds of texts, as well as
 exhibits, amateur conferences, musical performances, and monument
 dedications. The 1940 Mayakovsky jubilee created a set of texts and
 events that can be considered a "canonizing commentary." It guided
 interpretation not only (or even primarily) of Mayakovsky's literary
 works, but also of his life, poetic genealogy, and historical role in
 Soviet culture. The state used the creation of such a "commentary"
 to harness the intelligentsia, work out a new genealogy for Soviet
 poetry, and build on the didacticism of the 1937 Pushkin jubilee by
 promoting Mayakovsky as a representative of Soviet cultural identity.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
Theorizing Mayakovsky's canonization as a cohesive cultural process
requires a model of canon formation that can encompass the realities
of Soviet cultural institutions and life in the 1930s. Soviet literary
culture cannot be explained with Western models of canonization that
assume canons are created by an amiable consensus of a group that has
both political and cultural power.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 The Soviet period and the Stalin era in particular require a model
 that can incorporate coercion as well as consensus, and that can
 accommodate a shifting relation between these two methods for creating
 a "classic." Such a model must take into account the long-existing
 chasm between the intelligentsia and the people (<i>narod</i>) in the
 history of Russian and Soviet culture, and must incorporate the physical
 consequences of repressive cultural policy in the Soviet 1930s. Huge
 numbers of writers were imprisoned, sent to camps, murdered, or driven
 into silence as the Soviet canon developed.

<p>
A monolithic model of the canonizing authority does not fit the Stalinist
context, in which political authorities controlled practical aspects of
literary production while a cultural elite produced and affirmed literary
and cultural products. The canonizing authority itself must be split
into political power and cultural elite, as far as such a distinction
can be maintained in theory. The party controlled interpretations and
modifications

<b></b>

of the concept of the classic both by controlling the means of
cultural reproduction (press, media, paper, school curriculum, etc)
and by physically threatening the cultural elite and the masses. At
the same time, the party needed at least the appearance of a separate
cultural authority that affirmed Soviet literary and cultural value,
a stable source of national identity.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 The State thus tried to acquire the cultural authority of the
 intelligentsia and the literary tradition. In this way, the creation
 of a "Soviet canon" in the late 1930s worked hand in hand with the
 purges that destroyed or silenced many artists, writers, and critics.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 It is important to note, however, that the canonization process that
 created a Mayakovsky "commentary" loosened the intelligentsia's
 hold on cultural authority not only through repression, but also
 through dilution. The Party tried to dissolve the specificity of
 the intelligentsia as a social group by involving the masses in
 making the "commentary." In the 1930s, the general population, with
 state sponsorship, became part of the canonizing authority. Popular
 involvement in literary celebrations, for example, was a major theme
 of jubilee rhetoric and an essential component of jubilee events.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 A more dynamic, complex model of canonizing authority, and a more
 skeptical analysis of the "commentary" itself, is needed to explain
 Mayakovsky's canonization.

<p>
The first Soviet "commentary" on Mayakovsky suggests that canonization is
never complete, and that commentaries are neither all encompassing nor
static. Like Schmidt, Iuri Striedter argues that the literary classic
retains contradictory, potentially subversive values. According to
Striedter, in judging a text to be a classic, a canonizing authority must
canonize the whole work, not simply parts of it. Consequently, those parts
of the text that do not support the values of the reigning ideology must
also be canonized and made available to readers. The classic is therefore
always dynamic; the process of canonization can not completely eliminate
the potential of the textual artifact to support alternate and possibly
subversive meanings and values.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 This model of canonization can also be applied to the Soviet
 canonization of Mayakovsky himself in the 1930s; this process centered
 on the poet's biography, physical appearance, and reputation. Striedter
 suggests using the term canon mainly for texts, however he suggests
 it can be applied (cautiously) to authors and genres.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Striedter perhaps underestimates the Party's power to alter
 and destroy the textual artifact as well as the biography and
 physical being of the author. The Soviet canonizing authority could
 indeed eliminate or fail to publish sections of a text. Political
 authorities destroyed the classic's subversive potential not only
 through reinterpretation, but through physical violence and control
 over publishing. Censorship, obligatory rewrites, the library
 "special depository" (<i>spetskhran</i>), selective publishing,
 and outright destruction of texts were all ways of maintaining
 this control. Nevertheless, Striedter's model helps to explain
 how Mayakovsky managed to retain contradictory meanings even after
 canonization. In short, the canonical commentary designed to limit
 the classic Mayakovsky's subversive potential would, like the classic
 itself, turn out to be far from monolithic; the literary texts that
 composed it themselves contained potentially subversive aspects.

<p>
Creating this Soviet commentary required control of authoritative sources
of evidence. Lili Brik had begun her letter to Stalin by emphasizing
her role as keeper of

<b></b>

Mayakovsky's archive: "All affairs connected with publication of his
poetry and commemoration of his name have been centered on me. I have his
entire archive, manuscripts, notebooks, and drafts, all of his things. I
am editing his editions. I am approached for materials, information,
and photographs."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 However, after 1935, the state took over her role as caretaker of
 Mayakovsky's legacy, including the poet's manuscripts, artifacts,
 and publications. In October 1938, a state directive declared all of
 Mayakovsky's archive to be state property, and moved to concentrate
 his artifacts and manuscripts into a single and official location.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 The new Mayakovsky Museum, located in the flat he had shared with the
 Briks, was placed under government control and declared the central
 base for the new "Mayakovsky editorial commission" that was preparing
 the poet's collected works and that oversaw the archive.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 State control over the creation and continued existence of a Mayakovsky
 commentary depended on the 1938 state directive. The directive meant
 that the state could regulate and suppress not only existing texts,
 but also future production and verification of published memoirs
 and other sources of "fact." In 1938, the Mayakovsky Museum began to
 record memoirs of Mayakovsky and began soliciting any reminiscences
 or memories that citizens had of the poet. The museum staff's effort
 to collect memories and primary source documents was supported by many
 former friends and colleagues of Mayakovsky, and reveals a complex set
 of motivations. It can be seen as an attempt to preserve the past and to
 enable a more complete study of Mayakovsky's work and life. But it was
 also clearly an effort to fix memories and experiences of Mayakovsky
 in state institutions and authoritative textual forms that could be
 processed, controlled, cited, or hidden. Control over Mayakovsky's
 archive, and memoirs in particular, was what ultimately made possible
 the Mayakovsky celebration that was held in April 1940. In January, an
 official party directive established a committee to oversee preparations
 for a celebration to mark the tenth anniversary of Mayakovsky's death.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 The Mayakovsky celebration would involve both the mass population and
 the literary community in creating Mayakovsky's new "classic" image.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Soviet Literary Celebrations of the 1930s as Canonizing Institutions
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Like the Pushkin celebration of 1937, Stalin's 1935 statement about
Mayakovsky and the April 1940 celebration was in part meant to oppose
the Russian emigration by opposing their promotion of Russian "high"
culture with a Soviet "high" culture.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Nor was the 1940 jubilee an isolated or unique event. Celebrations and
 festivals so permeated this period that several scholars have applied
 the term "celebration culture" to the Soviet culture of the 1930s;
 massive public commemorations marked great cultural, scientific, and
 exploratory achievements (<i>PC,</i> 1-7). Among these celebrations,
 state-sponsored anniversary celebrations for "Soviet" authors, literary
 jubilees, were new and prominent developments in the cultural life of
 this period.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Most of them honored nineteenth-century Russian authors, but
 some celebrated great authors of "world" (invariably European)
 literature. However, even these were meant to demonstrate the Soviet
 people's great cultural advancement and their status as the true heirs

<b></b>

of the best cultural traditions.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 The largest and most studied of these celebrations, the Pushkin
 celebration, stretched into a whole year of events, texts, and
 commemorations for the entire nation.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
The Mayakovsky celebration reinforced for writers the specific options
that Stalin's statement had implied. Other literary jubilees of this
period presented a similar set of alternatives: in 1937 vicious newspaper
reports of trials and "enemies" alternated with warm, joyous articles
about Pushkin and the celebration. Marcus Levitt has seen this phenomenon
in the Soviet press as a contrast between negative and positive ideals
for the new Soviet man.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 The alternation of opposing images, however, seems more specifically
 oriented towards writers and critics. It reinforced popular suspicion
 and distrust of intellectuals while subjugating the intelligentsia
 into a state controlled literary event. Celebrating Pushkin alongside
 the purges demonstrated the alternatives presented to the literary
 intelligentsia: the potential for writers to be either "enemies"
 or "heroes" of the state. This contrast would become a major theme
 structuring the Mayakovsky celebration.

<p>
In appropriating the literary celebration to create the new image of the
Soviet poet, the State adopted an institution with a cultural tradition
in Imperial Russia. Since the 1880 Pushkin celebration, the literary
jubilee had been an institution in which, by gathering to celebrate a
literary classic, the intelligentsia affirmed its own cultural unity and
liberal values. Previous scholars have interpreted these celebrations
as an incarnation of a cultural "middle ground," a free neutral zone in
which members of the intelligentsia could express themselves and affirm
their group identity.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 This ideal of the celebration continued even during the Imperial
 government's 1899 Pushkin anniversary jubilee. In 1899, though many
 intellectuals abstained from the state-sponsored events in protest,
 they held their own "private" celebrations to express the anniversary's
 meaning for them.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 In the 1930s, the Soviet government, in sponsoring these literary
 celebrations, intentionally evoked the traditional role of the
 celebration as a forum for "free" intellectual discourse while
 controlling all aspects of publishing and other events. Soviet jubilees,
 unlike previous celebrations, combined the rhetoric of free intellectual
 debate with total centralized organization and censorship. In the 1930s,
 unlike the 1880s, the mass media could saturate the general population
 (many of whom were newly literate) with commemorative programs and
 texts. Because the party controlled all aspects of literary production
 and cultural activity, it was possible to coordinate print genres with
 jubilee events such as exhibits and conferences.

<p>
Scholars of Russian literary celebrations have usually treated them
either as occasions for rhetoric or as temporally limited public events.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 However, in conceptualizing the <i>Soviet</i> literary celebrations
 of the 1930s, it is difficult to separate texts from events or to
 distinguish the newspaper coverage of the jubilee from the jubilee
 itself. Establishing temporal limits for the celebration also becomes
 difficult: the 1937 Pushkin celebration stretched into a year-long
 event (often referred to as the "Pushkin Year") that intensified on
 Pushkin's death anniversary, but was not limited to it. Similarly,
 newspapers blurred the distinction between reports on preparations
 and reports on the actual jubilee exhibits and conferences. Newspapers
 reported on planning for conferences,

<b></b>

exhibits, and other events and texts to be produced for the
celebration. Several newspaper and journal articles from 1937 instruct
editors and journalists to frequently publish information about jubilee
preparations, as well as informational notes and letters from readers,
in order to raise expectations while reinforcing the national character
of the event.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 On the anniversary date, newspapers typically produced a multigeneric
 <i>litstranitsa</i> that included criticism, biography, poetry, and
 visual images; after the anniversary date newspaper articles described
 and evaluated the events and speeches of the celebration. In this way,
 they prepared readers for the celebration day, and then interpreted
 the events after the fact.

<p>
Defining a boundary between text and event in this period is all the
more difficult because newspaper layouts produced for the jubilee
combined features associated with both public exhibit and private
reading. Published literary pages displayed a multigeneric "exhibit"
of the author on or near the author's anniversary. Because the literary
pages published for the Mayakovsky celebration came out on or near the
anniversary of his death (April 14), they appeared within the strictest
temporal boundaries of the jubilee; moreover, they were regulated as
tightly as other aspects of the celebration. Like exhibitions, they
included memoirs, poems, and photographs. However, these were designed
for private reading rather than public viewing. At the same time, a
volume of photographs and portraits published in 1940 was designed to
be used as a permanent, portable "exhibit" of Mayakovsky in a public
setting such as a worker's club or a classroom.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Periodicals distributed plans for jubilee participants to follow in
 organizing events, as well as artistic texts. For all these reasons,
 Soviet celebrations must be examined as both print and event. Previous
 scholars have pointed out that Russian literary jubilees have always
 been cultural institutions with a specific social function, rather than
 just occasions for literary criticism or praise ("GR," 179-80). The
 Soviet celebrations were all-encompassing cultural institutions which
 penetrated all aspects of the mass media and cultural life. Mayakovsky's
 canonization was accomplished not through fiat, but through this
 institution that created his new symbolic and cultural value.

<p>
In his study of the "Gogol Days," Moeller-Sally applies a typology taken
from Don Handelman's <i>Models and Mirrors: Towards an Anthropology
of Public Events</i> to the institution of the literary celebration
(ibid.). Handelman separates public events into three types: events that
model, events of presentation, and events of representation.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Events that model are transformative and goal oriented, intended to
 produce a qualitative change in the real world. Events of presentation
 reflect a uniform vision of the social order and present no conflicting
 perspectives, creating their effect through an interaction between
 the event and the social order. Events of representation are more
 flexible, containing multiple perspectives that don't challenge the
 social order but "represent" conflicts or confrontations that exist
 within the social order (<i>MM,</i> 40-9). Moeller-Sally suggests that
 pre-revolutionary Russian literary jubilees mainly combine events of
 presentation and those of representation ("GR," 179-80). Applied to
 Soviet literary celebrations of the 1930s, this typology demonstrates
 the shift in jubilee function in this period. Soviet jubilees of the
 1930s were transformative, and primarily combined

<b></b>

aspects of Handelman's "events that model" and "events of
presentation." In this period, Soviet literature was designed to
act upon readers, making them into good Soviet citizens, rather than
simply providing reading material (<i>MSR,</i> 2). The Soviet jubilee
participant, like the reader, was an object rather than a recipient;
the jubilee sought to transform him or her into a Soviet citizen who
acknowledged the values and persona promoted in the name of the classic
poet.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 Explicit dissent and acknowledged diversity of opinion were not part of
 the jubilee events in the 1930s. They displayed a unified view of the
 social order and the literary classics. Through various participatory
 events and texts, they were to shape the public into Soviet citizens
 and writers into servants of the state.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
Pre-revolutionary literary celebrations have been discussed as a means
to promote national identity.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 Strictly speaking though, literary celebrations in general support
 cultural unity and identity, not strictly political identity. This
 is what made them so useful to the Soviet state. The 1930s literary
 celebrations promoted cultural identity and unity based on the Russian
 literary tradition.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 The ideals promoted by celebrations, particularly those for poets,
 joined the communal and personal aspects of being "cultured." In part
 they linked the new concept of "culturedness" (<i>kul'turnost'</i>)
 that was promoted in this period with what Jeffrey Brooks has called
 "culturism." The concept of "culturedness" in the 1930s encompassed
 cultural literacy, hygiene, and political consciousness. As promoted by
 the State, this new concept of "culturedness" was meant to encourage
 a revaluation of education and behavior, hygiene, and material goods
 previously considered suspect.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 Rather than nationalism, which promotes unity based on the nation-state,
 culturism promotes the idea that a certain culture unifies, or should
 unify, all the people.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 Though Brooks describes culturism as the "attitude" that educated
 classes held towards the lower classes, culturism also represented the
 attitude that newly educated people held towards their own cultural
 advancement. Like pre-revolutionary celebrations, 1930s literary
 jubilees expressed culturism; however, they expressed a culturism that
 was largely state controlled. The rhetoric of the celebrations promoted
 the poet and the event itself as a source of both "culturedness" and
 culturism. The Soviet "classic" poet thus embodied and enabled both
 personal achievement and cultural unity.

<p>
The literary jubilees of the late 1930s expressed the government's
first definitive approach to the Russian literary heritage; it finally
resolved a debate over the literary heritage that had raged through the
1920s. Many writers, critics, and politicians had regarded the classics
as a potentially dangerous product of bourgeois culture, an inheritance
that was inherently suspect. Others declared that, like property, the
classics should be distributed to the working class; moreover, they argued
that the classics should serve as stylistic models for the new Soviet
literature. The State had adopted no definite position in this debate.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 In the 1930s, state-approved criticism and political rhetoric began to
 describe Pushkin and other pre-revolutionary authors as forefathers
 of Soviet culture, progressive minds, and spiritual contemporaries
 of Soviet life (<i>RC,</i> 113). This new attitude was not so much
 to promote the classics as stylistic models for Socialist Realism
 as to historicize Soviet literature as the natural final development
 of the Russian literary tradition. Vladimir Paperny has discussed a
 similar movement

<b></b>

towards historical continuity and standardization in the architecture of
this period: "The basic problem of architecture becomes [in the 1930s]
the assimilation of the heritage."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 Stalinist culture was portrayed as the end development of all culture,
 the goal towards which all history had been evolving. The 1940
 Mayakovsky celebration in particular expressed this idea in the literary
 sphere. The Mayakovsky jubilee was the first celebration for a Soviet
 author's death anniversary and the first jubilee for a Soviet-era
 poet. As such, it helped to historicize the first decade of Soviet
 rule, making this period a part of "history" and imagining Mayakovsky
 as belonging to the literary canon, thus breaking his very real ties
 to living writers and to continuing literary debates. Mayakovsky's
 canonization, then, was not only about creating a state "classic"
 poet as a mouthpiece of Soviet propaganda; it legitimized Soviet
 cultural and literary history. The Pushkin celebration had symbolized
 and expressly promoted a new unified narrative of Soviet poetry as a
 single line of development from Pushkin. In 1940 jubilee rhetoric,
 Mayakovsky represents the final flowering of Soviet literature,
 the last stage that completes the symbolic development of Soviet
 literature and justifies its origins. By historicizing Mayakovsky,
 the 1940 jubilee confirms the finality of this stage.

<p>
By sponsoring official literary celebrations, the State took
over the Russian intelligentsia's traditional use of literary
anniversaries. Jubilee celebrations in the pre-revolutionary modernist
period had been an important means by which Russian Symbolist and
Acmeist poets, in particular, defined their "mythological chronology." By
celebrating Pushkin, they had affirmed the parallels between the "Silver"
and "Golden" ages of Russian culture, and declared Pushkin as their own
literary "father."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 Soviet celebrations of the 1930s similarly used the jubilee to
 express a correspondence between historical periods: the "Golden Age"
 of Pushkin and the era of Stalin. Numerous essays published for the
 Pushkin celebration portrayed the Soviet people as Pushkin's true
 contemporaries, the fulfillment of his prophecy (<i>PC,</i> 118). See,
 for example, how Ivan Luppol portrays Pushkin as a godlike re,
 emphasizing his all-seeing gaze, a feature normally attributed to
 Stalin:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And this man&#8212;because he was a man&#8212;looks at us today with his
intelligent, penetrating eyes. We feel his gaze on us and are proud of
it. And we say to him: Pushkin, your words:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And at the entrance to the tomb
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let a young life play . . .
<br />
have come to pass. At the grave of the great Russian poet a young,
joyous socialist life is playing.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In Luppol's formulation, Pushkin thus not only envisions the Soviet
future, but also remains alive in some eternal realm, watching over the
Soviet people as Stalin does.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 The Pushkin celebration effectively created a new "mythological
 coordination" which aligned the Stalinist 1930s with the "Golden Age,"
 appropriating for the state the earlier self-mythology of the Russian
 intelligentsia.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 The Mayakovsky jubilee drew on this parallel by suggesting that
 Mayakovsky's historical position was parallel to Pushkin's: just as
 Pushkin was the source of the Russian literary tradition, Mayakovsky
 embodied the new Soviet literature. Articles stressed Mayakovsky's
 role as the "Sun of Soviet

<b></b>

Poetry," heir to the Pushkinian tradition.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 The Mayakovsky jubilee developed and affirmed the parallel historical
 roles created for the two poets in critical articles published for
 the 1937 Pushkin celebration.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
By participating in the Literary celebrations of the 1930s, the population
could express its Soviet cultural literacy and could learn the correct
forms for praising the Soviet classics. The literary jubilees proclaimed
the unity of Soviet peoples in celebrating classic authors, while their
very existence reinforced the implicit hierarchy that made the Russian
cultural tradition primary in Soviet culture.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 In theory, Soviet cultural unity was supposed to be expressed by staging
 similar literary celebrations for authors of the "brother republics,"
 but their equivalency was belied by the massive scale of the Pushkin
 celebration. In fact, despite their rhetoric, Soviet jubilees expressed
 the supremacy of the Russian culture in two ways: first through the
 larger amount of resources devoted to Russian authors like Pushkin
 and Mayakovsky, and second by making a Russian cultural institution,
 the literary jubilee, the basis for creating and affirming cultural
 value. An unsigned piece of propaganda, published for the Lermontov
 celebration in 1939, presents the official symbolism of the literary
 celebrations, tying them to the 1939 Soviet invasion of western Ukraine
 and Byelorussia:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
All the peoples of the Soviet Union ceremonially commemorate the great
Russian poet. . . . The cultural holiday dedicated to Lermontov will enter
the ranks of the cultural holidays dedicated to poets and poetic works
of other peoples of the USSR: [Taras] Shevchenko, [Shota] Rustaveli,
[Ilias' Lusif Gandzhevi] Nizami. . . . This "roll-call" of great names
reveals with obvious conviction the brotherly friendship of all the
Soviet peoples and their great cultural mission. . . . We will reveal for
our brothers, freed by the valorous Red army from the overlord's yoke
in western Ukraine and western Byelorussia a path to all the cultural
riches of modernity and the cultural heritage of the past.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
These Soviet literary celebrations presented a cultural tradition not
tied to language or ethnicity, but to the Soviet State and to Soviet
communist doctrine. Celebrations demonstrated Soviet cultural unity by
showing how the other republics embraced Russian culture.

<p>
The events and texts of the 1940 celebration promoted Mayakovsky as the
foundation for the Soviet culture that unified the national literatures
of the republics. Jubilee essays and memoirs stressed Mayakovsky's own
active role in unifying the republics during his extensive travels across
the Soviet Union and abroad, through his family history (like Stalin,
he was born in Georgia), and through his attention to poets of other
nationalities.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 The Mayakovsky celebration thus created a vision of Soviet cultural
 identity that was synchronically bound by the different Soviet peoples
 and diachronically bound to the Russian literary and cultural tradition.

<p>
Juxtaposing the 1937 Pushkin jubilee with the 1940 Mayakovsky celebration,
one can see how the latter demonstrated the supposedly increased tempo
of historical progress in Stalinist society. A main theme of the Pushkin
jubilee of 1937 was the gulf between pre- and post-revolutionary reality:
the Pushkin celebration supposedly expressed a sincere popular adoration
of the poet that had been impossible in the Imperial

<b></b>

period. In contrast, the Mayakovsky celebration marked a ten-year period
entirely within the Stalin era. The celebration was an occasion to note
that Soviet life had in this period fulfilled Mayakovsky's hopes and
dreams. During the Mayakovsky celebration's commemorative evening held
in the Bolshoi Theater Alexander Fadeev began his talk by affirming the
great transformation of Soviet life since 1930: "In this time socialism
has been built in our country."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 It is clear that the celebration did not merely revise the public's
 image of Mayakovsky or promote a politicized interpretation of the poet,
 though these were certainly important goals of its organizers. As a
 celebration of Soviet achievement, it portrayed authors and literary
 accomplishments with the same model of progress that characterized
 other spheres of Soviet society. By the fact of its existence, the 1940
 celebration expressed a new Soviet poetic ideal, portraying Mayakovsky
 as the ultimate merger of literary and political advancement.

<p>
Levitt has said that the literary jubilees of the 1930s represented
that tradition's complete transformation into a state ideological tool,
a process that had begun with the Imperial Pushkin celebration of 1899
(<i>RLP,</i> 158-64). Though he suggests that the 1937 Pushkin celebration
was the culmination of this process, the transformation was most fully
expressed in the Mayakovsky celebration of April 1940. Unlike the Pushkin
celebration, the Mayakovsky celebration allowed none of the poet's works
to escape from the language of Soviet ideology. Slogans and excerpts from
Mayakovsky's most politically engaged Soviet works were the standard fare,
while many of his pre-revolutionary poems, particularly ones in which
the poet's biographical persona predominated, were de-emphasized and
rarely republished in popular editions. Texts printed for the celebration
repeated Stalin's comment about Mayakovsky like a mantra; the quotation's
prominent place in jubilee displays reminded all that the celebration's
forms, texts, and events were to be seen as an incarnation of Stalin's
words. Although everyone knew the source of the "best, most talented"
formulation, this phrase was always explicitly attributed to Stalin in
jubilee articles, banners, displays, and books. The prominent linking
of Stalin with literary value is somewhat unusual, in fact: Friedberg
has found that certain accepted authorities (such as Lenin and Nikolai
Chernyshevsky) were commonly cited in the 1930s to settle arguments and
support interpretations of the classics; Stalin, however, was never one
of these unquestionable authorities (<i>RC,</i> 117). By contrast, in
1940 Stalin was the primary authority supporting Mayakovsky's cultural
and literary value. The explicit references to his authority throughout
the celebration show the greater degree of political significance and
intimidation expressed in the canonization of Mayakovsky and reinforce
the implication that the jubilee was a direct expression of Stalin's will.

<p>
As Alekseeva has noted, "the tenth anniversary of Mayakovsky's
death became a pretext for the mass inculcation of the 'necessary'
Mayakovsky into social consciousness" ("DLS," 179). The 1940 celebration
simultaneously addressed the masses' preconceptions about Mayakovsky
and enlisted them and the intelligentsia in composing a state-approved
"commentary" that would frame Mayakovsky for future readers. The
Mayakovsky jubilee was an important publishing and cultural event,
spawning three compilation volumes, hundreds of articles and memoirs,
symphonies, film scripts, biographical

<b></b>

fiction, poems, anthologies, teaching plans, portraits, and other texts
and events.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
 New collections of Mayakovsky's work appeared, including a large
 one-volume edition designed for mass consumption. As in the Pushkin
 jubilee, readings, exhibits, amateur and professional conferences,
 and commemorative evenings were held all over the Soviet Union. The
 commemorative evening held at the Bolshoi Theater was attended by
 political and literary dignitaries and reported on in all of the major
 papers. Fadeev's speech at this event was published as a separate
 booklet in 50,000 copies. Museums and libraries created Mayakovsky
 exhibits for their patrons and sponsored amateur conferences and
 readings.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
 A documentary film, with a script written by O. Brik, was shown at
 jubilee evenings and lectures, while the papers touted an artistic
 film about Mayakovsky in the works.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Commemorative Mayakovsky texts and events saturated the anniversary
 on 14 April 1940 and continued throughout the year.

<p>
Many of the materials published for the celebration centered, as literary
jubilees usually did, on reinventing the cultural myths of the poet's
person. Library and education magazines debated how best to introduce
Mayakovsky to various types of readers.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
 In particular, the celebration seemed to require the publication
 of numerous "factual" accounts of Mayakovsky's life for the general
 reader. Poetry praising Mayakovsky in newspaper <i>litstranitsy</i> and
 jubilee volumes also granted him "classic" status by describing him as
 a literary interlocutor for both amateur and professional poets. Many
 poems were published and performed for the celebration; the most
 prominent was by Mayakovsky's friend, the poet Nikolai Aseev, whose
 long poem <i>Mayakovsky Begins</i> (<i>Maiakovskii nachinaetsia</i>
 [1940]) won the first Stalin prize for poetry in 1941. The 1940
 anniversary produced the first comprehensive body of texts (such as
 homage poetry) and events (such as exhibits and school theatricals)
 that supported Mayakovsky's status as a literary classic of Soviet
 culture. In promoting these types of texts in 1940, critics affirmed the
 hierarchy of genres composing the Mayakovsky commentary. They repeatedly
 asserted that personal observations, the "fact" of memoirs, had to
 be subordinated to the "truth" of formulaic biographical narrative
 that would define Mayakovsky for future generations. Texts like Victor
 Shklovsky's <i>O Maiakorskom</i> (<i>About Mayakovsky,</i> published in
 English as <i>Mayakovsky and His Circle</i>) were printed in tiny runs
 of 5,000 and were savaged in reviews for their "incorrect biographical
 method" (in Shklovsky's case this referred to the indeterminate genre
 and personal content of his memoiristic/autobiographical/artistic
 work). Formulaic third-person narratives of Mayakovsky's evolution
 into a great Soviet poet were published in huge printings of 100,000
 copies. Of course, the content of published texts about Mayakovsky
 was censored and negative features were not allowed to appear.

A Mayakovsky for the Masses
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Unlike contemporary American commemorations of literary anniversaries,
the Mayakovsky jubilee celebration was to be an event not just for
academia but for everyone.
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
 General readers experienced the jubilee through commemorative newspaper
 <i>litstranitsy</i> that functioned as miniature exhibits for the mass
 reader, combining photos,

<b></b>

sketches, critical articles, memoirs, and poetry in a commemorative
layout. The public was invited to take part in amateur reading circles,
attend a lecture series, and write verse or essays for the local
newspapers. In other words, the public participated in the celebration
not only as an audience but also as writers and scholars. In addition
to the scholarly memoirs written by Mayakovsky's literary colleagues,
popular memoirs portrayed Mayakovsky from the perspective of the average
audience member at one of his performances, or depicted a chance meeting
with the poet. Verses by amateur writers and children were published
in the jubilee edition of the newspapers. The celebration thus demanded
at least the image of active participation.

<p>
Soviet scholarship on the literary jubilees of the 1930s, not
surprisingly, reads them as evidence that the masses had made
the literary heritage and its values their own. In the press, the
Mayakovsky celebration was described&#8212;as the Pushkin celebration
had been&#8212;as evidence of the Soviet people's cultural literacy and
emotional attachment to the poet.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
 The celebration supposedly expressed the people's "burning love for
 the best, most talented poet of our epoch."
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
 Both contemporaries and later Soviet scholars described these events
 as spontaneous manifestations of Soviet unity, humanism, and love. The
 following interpretation is typical:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
With great love the workers marked these jubilees dedicated to the
producers of patriotic literature: Chernyshevsky, [Nikolai] Gogol,
[Leo] Tolstoy, [Mikhail] Lermontov, [Nikolai] Nekrasov, the classic of
Azerbaidzhani literature M[irza-Fatali] Akhundov. . . . The measures
taken bore witness to the Soviet people's great mastery of the spiritual
values of the classical heritage. In reality the official ceremonies
turned into mass holidays of the multi-national Soviet culture.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, these celebrations were not spontaneous, but state-sponsored
and controlled. Moreover, the passivity of the participants in these
celebrations was a constant problem for the organizers.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
 Though official rhetoric portrayed them as spontaneous manifestations of
 popular love for culture, the explicit didacticism of the celebrations
 indicated that the cultural level of the people was not as high as
 was desired. Speeches at the Pushkin celebration, while interpreting
 the jubilee as proof of the "dawn of Soviet culture" were typical in
 citing its didactic goals:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Undoubtedly the Pushkin festivities themselves, having unfolded into
such a grandiose cultural parade on the basis of the huge victories of
socialism in our country, are having and will have the most beneficial
effects on the further development of the culture of the numerous peoples
populating the Soviet Union.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The rhetoric that portrayed jubilees as spontaneous expressions of emotion
was contradicted by these stated hopes and by the explicitly didactic
aims of the organizers. Similar goals were espoused during the Mayakovsky
celebration, which not only taught a public unfamiliar with his work,
but proclaimed Mayakovsky's bond with the people while simultaneously
countering popular preconceptions about the poet. Mayakovsky was to be
presented as "national/popular" (<i>narodnyi</i>) and "comprehensible"
(<i>poniatnyi</i>).

<b></b>

Ultimately, therefore, the celebration sought the participation of
the mass population in order to control their exposure to Mayakovsky
and to teach them to associate the "Soviet classic" with his person
and reputation.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
During the 1940 jubilee, Soviet citizens engaged Mayakovsky's newly
ideologized biography, works, and literary significance through reading,
but also through participating in events. Amateur conferences and
gatherings of factory reading-circles were organized by party operatives
who would be sure to be politically correct. The jubilee not only promoted
the proper interpretations of Mayakovsky's life and works, it created
the image of a nationwide public participation in the affirmation of its
themes. For example, commemorative issues of magazines and newspapers
published numerous "popular" voices asserting Mayakovsky's value for
the Soviet people. Memoir sketches and testimonials from citizens were
published in literary journals, popular journals, and national and
provincial newspapers. "The Living Mayakovsky," an article published
in the journal <i>Literaturnoe Obozrenie</i> exemplifies how critics
could use "popular" memoirs to create a new "popular" discourse about
Mayakovsky to counter the masses' preconceptions. The article's author,
Oleg Leonidov, published a mosaic of excerpts from memoirs that appeared
in provincial newspapers, explaining how they proved Mayakovsky was a
kind, decent man (instead of a vulgar bohemian), who assisted other poets
and wrote comprehensible verses that expressed the soul of the nation.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
 Leonidov's use of "popular" memoir sketches to make these points in
 a literary magazine demonstrates how images of popular involvement
 in the celebration were used to create the new Mayakovsky myth;
 they were transformed into authoritative voices that rivaled those of
 Mayakovsky's former friends and colleagues. These themes were sounded
 directly in slogans, criticism, and editorial articles; however,
 artistic and documentary genres played an equally important role in
 revising the image of Mayakovsky. Published jubilee poems, anecdotes,
 and memoirs, often by "average" people, created images of personal
 interactions with the great poet.

<p>
The 1940 Mayakovsky celebration occasioned great efforts by librarians,
teachers, and others to organize exposure to Mayakovsky and to certain
of his works. Instructions for librarians, published in <i>Krasnyi
Bibliotekar'</i> [<i>Red Librarian</i>], outlined in detail the ways
local librarians should propagandize Mayakovsky.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
 It was their responsibility to organize exhibits and amateur
 conferences, advise patrons, collect responses, and recommend poetry
 and criticism. Like the 1937 Pushkin celebration, the Mayakovsky jubilee
 included events at collective farms, local libraries, reading rooms, and
 factories. Special "Mayakovsky" features&#8212;including testimonials,
 letters, verses, biographies, and essays&#8212;were published not only
 in literary magazines, but also in professional and popular periodicals.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
 Mayakovsky's "comprehensibility," in particular, was created not only
 through general statements in criticism and editorials about his
 poetry, but also through presentations of and by "real" people who
 worked to overcome their initial difficulties in understanding his
 verse. Popular memoirs and testimonials cited real-life incidents
 that proved Mayakovsky was comprehensible to those who learned to
 read his work properly. They often stressed his role as a teacher on
 his lecture tours. In the context of the jubilee, proper performance
 indicated comprehension:

<b></b>

being able to read Mayakovsky's work well meant that one understood it.
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
 The 1940 jubilee not only dictated the correct interpretation
 of Mayakovsky (Mayakovsky is comprehensible), but also, through
 incorporating "popular" voices and amateur literary productions,
 modeled a pattern of public response to Mayakovsky's poetry. This kind
 of model allowed jubilee organizers to acknowledge the average reader's
 difficulty in understanding the poetry while portraying comprehension
 as the ultimate result of reading aloud. This ideal of comprehension
 downplayed the importance of understanding the historical or poetic
 context of the poems themselves, stressing instead the public
 participation in events such as amateur conferences and readings
 arranged for the celebration. In this way, models of reading promoted
 in 1940 discouraged investigation of Mayakovsky's Futurist poetics,
 his polemics with other literary factions, his historical and poetic
 influences and allusions, or his use of autobiographical content. This
 approach to Mayakovsky's work separated the poet from the simultaneous
 repression of avant-garde and "formalist" poetry and the persecution
 of his friends and colleagues. This model of reading allowed the poet
 to be recontextualized into the new "realist" canon of Soviet poetry,
 as an heir to Pushkin.

<p>
The jubilee celebration's images and texts taught readers not only to
interpret Mayakovsky as a Soviet political poet, but also to regard him
as a heroic re, encouraging them to read literature and literary
res with the same framework applied to other spheres of cultural life.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
 The 1940 celebration promoted and circulated Mayakovsky as a symbol of
 Soviet achievements in literature equal to the industrial achievements
 touted in the Soviet press. To create Mayakovsky's new heroic Soviet
 image, many authors developed a new biography of Mayakovsky for the
 general reader, one that identified communist ideals in even his early
 work. These specific interpretation of Mayakovsky's life and works
 stressed his story as a model for common readers, a heroic narrative
 of Socialist Realism.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
 In the 1930s, numerous heroic biographies of notable people were
 published, many of them written according to a standard pattern,
 so that distinctions between fiction and biography began to
 disappear (<i>SN,</i> 122-3). Several structural components of the
 Socialist Realist Novel can be discerned in the jubilee images of
 Mayakovsky. First, Socialist Realist novels often create for the hero
 a surrogate "family" to replace the hero's natural family.
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
 Menzel has stressed the portrayal of Mayakovsky's idyllic childhood
 family in works such as Kal'ma's biography for young people, <i>Great
 Steps</i> (<i>Bol'shie shagi</i> [1940]). However, in Kal'ma's and
 other jubilee biographies, Mayakovsky's revolutionary work and "family"
 become more prominent than his real family, or his literary cohorts.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
 Certainly the family that Mayakovsky himself had defined as an adult in
 his suicide note was downplayed or eliminated in the official jubilee
 "commentary."
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
 The official version of Mayakovsky's biography also reflects the second
 pattern that Clark identified as belonging to the Socialist Realist
 hero: the na&iuml;ve, spontaneous protagonist who gradually develops
 Soviet consciousness and rationality. The jubilee Mayakovsky, like the
 Socialist Realist hero, relied on a mentor, meetings with whom advance
 political consciousness. For Mayakovsky, Gorky becomes this mentor.
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
 This is apparent in numerous publications, such as the memoirs of
 Gorky's second wife Maria Andreeva, which were published in the 13 April

<b></b>

1940 issue of <i>Pravda.</i> Andreeva glowingly describes Gorky's
recognition of the young Mayakovsky's talent and his work to help the
young poet publish; she also dwells on Mayakovsky's childlike personality
and his loving respect for Gorky.
<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
 The jubilee thus recreated Mayakovsky as a Soviet classic in part
 by transferring the plots of Socialist Realism, and specifically the
 narrative of heroic development onto Mayakovsky and into the literary
 canon.

<p>
It is true that literary celebrations were concentrated in urban centers
and did not necessarily penetrate life in the countryside. Their effect
on the rural population, if any, is unclear.
<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
 However, the 1940 Mayakovsky celebration did attempt to reach and
 involve the general reader; moreover, the portrayal of the celebration's
 effect on the general reader was itself a major goal. Perhaps the state
 promoted Mayakovsky not to cultivate a real love for his poetry, but to
 change the popular connotations that his name carried. Even if it did
 not love Mayakovsky or read his work after the jubilee, the general
 population would no longer think of him as only an incomprehensible
 Futurist. Readers would associate certain important Soviet phrases
 and roles with him and would interpret him in as a part of a literary
 tradition that they should value and celebrate. Popular involvement
 (and the description of it in newspapers and journals) would keep the
 intelligentsia from owning the celebration, while teaching the public
 to associate the forms of the literary celebration with Soviet culture.

<!--_a-head-->
Writers' Participation in the Mayakovsky Celebration
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In considering professional writers' participation in the 1940
Mayakovsky celebration, it is important to remember that Stalin had
defined opposition and indifference to the poet as a crime against the
state. Menzel has concluded that fear of punishment for this new "crime"
colors all writings about Mayakovsky after 1935.
<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
 Although it is true that this definition of a new "crime" particularly
 intimidated and threatened writers, scholarship on Mayakovsky after
 1935 was motivated by a complex mix of social and psychological
 factors that are hard to separate. These included fear of persecution,
 desire to publish, official compulsion, political and/or professional
 opportunism, and sincere regard for Mayakovsky's work. Because the
 official pronouncement on Mayakovsky indicated the offense to be avoided
 it is difficult to separate the fear generated by Stalin's statement
 from the atmosphere of fear that permeated all literary culture in
 the late 1930s.

<p>
Mayakovsky was perhaps able to save some individuals as well. Stalin
reportedly crossed Lili Brik's name off a list of arrestees, saying,
"We won't touch Mayakovsky's wife [sic]".
<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
 Many writers with connections to Mayakovsky published memoirs and
 articles about him for the rest of their careers.
<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
 It is quite possible that ties to Mayakovsky protected Vasilii Kamensky,
 Vladimir Pertsov, Shklovsky, and other writers at least to some extent
 during the Stalin era. The 1940 celebration occasioned many sincere
 works and presentations by former friends and colleagues who willingly
 participated in the festivities.
<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
 Thus, Stalin's comments may have allowed some writers to remain
 professionally active to the extent that their ties with the poet
 may have

<b></b>

sheltered them or provided an outlet for their creative
activity. Mayakovsky's new Soviet value, it seems, could be more than a
symbol of state ideology; for some it could provide a measure of shelter
or creativity.

<p>
Although state control over all aspects of the celebration means that
Levitt's idea of a free neutral zone cannot apply to the Stalin period, it
is clear that the "special cultural space" of the 1930s celebrations did
present some opportunities for individual expression and for disagreement
within (though not outside of) official celebration discourse (<i>PC,</i>
115). Much valuable Mayakovsky scholarship was published in 1940, as well
as personal and sincere reflections on Mayakovsky and his place in Soviet
literature. However, the celebration itself both reinforced the state's
control over cultural value and contributed to the dissolution of the
intelligentsia as a separate group. The Mayakovsky celebration merged
literary and political value in the re of Mayakovsky, whose poetic
development was rewritten into a political evolution starting in his
childhood. In the 1930s Stalin had begun to use the term "intelligentsia"
to include party elite as well as intellectuals.
<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
 In the 1940 jubilee, the state continued to dissolve the intelligentsia
 while taking its authority to promote literary classics and determine
 literary value. The jubilee events for factory workers, amateur
 scholars, and schoolchildren, as well as the popular responses to
 Mayakovsky published in the press, diluted the specific meanings that
 could be attached to the celebration by the literary community.

<p>
Despite the imposition of state ideology, the Soviet jubilees did
provide opportunities to discuss literature that was not written in
the Socialist Realist mode. In the 1937 Pushkin celebration, Pushkin
at least could present a subject for textual analysis that was free
from Soviet ideology. Moreover, involvement in the jubilee enabled the
writers to at least maintain contact with a readership, sustaining the
memory of their names and perhaps their other works. A similar motivation
probably propelled the former friends and colleagues of Mayakovsky. Many
who wrote about Mayakovsky for the celebration pushed the boundaries of
acceptable jubilee literature. Shklovsky's <i>About Mayakovsky</i> (<i>O
Maiakovskom</i>) and Kamensky's <i>Life with Mayakovsky</i> (<i>Zhizn'
s Maiakovskim</i>) both use the occasion of the celebration to publish
jubilee texts grounded in their personal relationship with the poet.
<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>
 In focusing on personal relationships in Mayakovsky's artistic,
 rather than political beginnings, they tried to situate their
 ideal of the "true" Mayakovsky within the boundaries of jubilee
 scholarship. Ambiguous participation in the 1930s literary celebrations
 has been acknowledged by Petrone, who has stressed the possibilities
 for unorthodox expression inherent in what she terms "celebration
 discourse," the literary, visual, and musical expressions dealing with
 the celebrations (<i>PC,</i> 7-8). Petrone's concept of "celebration
 discourse" highlights the potential for Aesopian language and multiple
 meanings in even state approved texts. The Russian tradition of
 "Aesopian language" permeated many published texts in the Stalin
 Era. Forms of Russian Aesopian language developed by writers through
 the years include hidden allusions, secret irony, allegories, and
 mockery disguised as overly effusive praise.
<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>
 The very rigidity and ritualistic nature of public discourse may
 have enabled more Aesopian language and multiple meanings than would
 have been possible in a more individualized public sphere (<i>SN,</i>
 12-3). Writers could use Aesopian

<b></b>

language in the 1937 Pushkin celebration to incorporate a variety of
political and personal themes into even sanctioned jubilee texts and
rhetoric (<i>PC,</i> 141-8). Portraits of Pushkin as a persecuted poet
who advocated freedom, for example, conformed to the official Soviet
interpretation of Pushkin as a poet persecuted by a reactionary Tsarist
regime, while also suggesting contemporary situations of repression that
could not be mentioned directly.
<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>
 These ambiguities in rhetoric demonstrate that the intelligentsia's
 participation in the Mayakovsky celebration did not simply mean
 conformity. Their texts could raise similarly suggestive criticisms
 while seemingly expressing the correct attitude towards the Soviet
 "classic." One memoir, published in <i>Literaturnyi Sovremennik</i>
 by Rita Rait, begins with what seems to be a general reference to
 the passage of time (a conventional opening for a memoir): "Time,
 as is well known, wipes away penciled notations, eats up ink, yellows
 photographs with years, breaks old letters along the folds, and <i>burns
 shreds of diaries in the stove</i>" [emphasis added].
<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>
 The memoirist's reference to time's disintegrating effect on words and
 photographs ends on an action that does not naturally result from the
 passage of time: the burning of diaries. This phrase would no doubt
 evoke the burning of letters, diaries, and other papers during the
 purges to destroy evidence that might be found and used against an
 arrested person or his/her friends by the secret police. The jubilee
 memoir, it seems, could allude to the present in its framing of the
 past, referring indirectly to Stalin's purges and their effect on
 literary texts. The institution of the literary celebration could be
 a forum for politically ambiguous or subversive allusions not only in
 jubilee texts, but also in performances and public settings. Nadezhda
 Mandelstam remembers the private meanings shared by Osip Mandelstam and
 the director Yakhontov in Voronezh, as Yakhontov performed a one-man
 show he had created about Mayakovsky and Pushkin:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In a turn entitled "Traveling Poets" he [Yakhontov] read passages from
Pushkin's "Journey to Erzrum" [sic] and from Mayakovsky in such a way
as to suggest that poets could travel abroad only under the Soviet
regime. The audience reacted with total indifference: nobody then
imagined that anybody could travel abroad and as they left at the
end of this baffling evening, the only comment they could manage was
"That's what comes from living too well." At one point he would recite
from Mayakovsky's poem about the "Soviet Passport" and, taking his own
identity papers from his pocket, brandish them in front of the audience,
looking all the time straight at M. [Osip Mandelstam]. M. took his
brand-new papers out of his pocket and they exchanged knowing glances. The
authorities would have taken a very poor view of such antics, but they
are very literal-minded, and there were no instructions to cover cases
of this kind.
<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As sanctioned events with a clearly acceptable purpose, jubilees provided
rare opportunities for public gathering and performance of the type
N. Mandelstam mentions. In this context Yakhontov's play was able to
suggest a private context in a public setting, carrying a special meaning
to certain participants.
<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>
 The link between Mayakovsky and Pushkin could also allude to the
 contemporary persecution of poets in the USSR. Jubilee events and texts
 could therefore be ambiguous, conveying unsanctioned meanings while
 seemingly conforming to official political and ideological demands.

<b></b>

<p>
By participating in the literary celebrations writers could maintain
relationships with a readership, and promote certain roles or ideals
of authorship. Anna Akhmatova, for example, after years of enforced
silence, managed to perform her verse, "Mayakovsky in 1913," publicly
for a Mayakovsky jubilee event held in Leningrad.
<sup><a name="REF92" href="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>
 Furthermore, jubilee writings, while preserving the official Soviet
 value that their commentary supported, sometimes used themes and
 narrative forms that called into question the commentary conventions
 themselves. The most notorious example of this is Shklovsky's <i>About
 Mayakovsky</i>; Shklovsky violated thematic expectations by discussing
 Mayakovsky's Futurist period at length and highlighting his connections
 to Futurism (<i>MR,</i> 174-5). However, he also violated generic
 expectations by writing a book that could not easily be classified as
 either "memoir" (a text that could be evaluated as "fact" or personal
 reminiscence), or "biography" (a genre that in this period required
 an impersonal narrative voice and formulaic plot). Shklovsky used the
 jubilee volume about Mayakovsky to actively engage with expectations
 of jubilee texts, specifically biographies. His book shows how the
 Mayakovsky jubilee could be made into a forum for challenging the
 structure of commentary that it sanctioned and created.

Conclusion
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Understanding Mayakovsky's canonization as a cultural process clarifies
how the ideal of Soviet literature transformed the res of literary
modernism. It is all the more important because the mechanisms of the
Soviet poetic canon in the 1930s are still poorly understood. The "poet
function" of Socialist Realism has yet to be studied in detail.
<sup><a name="REF93" href="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>
 Unlike the prose canon, the Socialist Realist canon for poetry depended
 on a set of model poets. Critical studies of this canon, however, have
 approached it as a selection of model texts. The recent resurgence of
 critical interest in Socialist Realism and Stalinist culture of the
 1930s has largely neglected the role of the poet and poetry, focusing
 instead on the novel as the primary Socialist realist genre.
<sup><a name="REF94" href="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>
 Mayakovsky's canonization demonstrates both the interconnectedness
 of poetry and prose (as prose narratives were applied to Mayakovsky's
 own biography) and the uniqueness of poetry and the role of the poet,
 as opposed to the prose writer, in this period. It is clear from the
 rhetoric of celebrations devoted to Pushkin and Mayakovsky in the
 1930s, as well as the numerous literary and visual representations of
 the poet in this period, that the poet, not the poem, is the basis for
 the Socialist Realist poetic canon. This canon was based upon a master
 narrative of evolution in literary history embodied in a succession
 of heroic poet-res. Mayakovsky's biography, like Pushkin's,
 reflected an archetypal biographical narrative that confirmed his
 status in the canon.

<p>
Far from being the "background" for the larger changes in literature of
the 1930s, literary jubilees created the new ideal of the Soviet classic
poet and modeled the ways that the public was meant to interact with and
celebrate the classic poets. The Mayakovsky celebration of 1940 created
the first coherent Soviet commentary on Mayakovsky, and involved both
intellectuals and the public in creating and revising the poet's persona
and legacy. It demonstrates that Mayakovsky's "canonization" must

<b></b>

be understood as more than simply the imposition of state values upon a
dead poet. The state used the jubilee to enlist the literary community
in revising the popular image of Mayakovsky. The "commentary" created
by the jubilee employed both text and event, and used materials for
both specialists and general readers. It promoted a cohesive narrative
biography, character, and genealogy, and it institutionalized conventions
to recreate and support the values these images of the poet contained. The
Mayakovsky celebration of 1940 introduced the formulae that would be
used for Mayakovsky celebrations in subsequent years. On a more basic
level, it established the ways in which the public was meant to interact
with the Soviet classic poet, defining the genres of texts, events,
and languages that would be applied in future decades.

Birgit Menzel notes that A. Mekhlis, the head editor of <i>Pravda,</i>
attempted to weaken Stalin's statement by removing the superlative. The
phrase as reproduced in this issue of <i>Pravda</i> called Mayakovsky
"the best, talented poet of our Soviet epoch" ("luchshii, talantlivyi poet
nashei sovetskoi epokhi"). In the 17 December issue of <i>Pravda,</i>
and in all subsequent citations of this quotation, the superlative
"most talented" ("talantliveishii") returns. See Birgit Menzel,
<i>V. V. Majakovskij und seine Rezeption in der Sowjetunion l930-54,</i>
(Berlin: Harrassowitz Verlag, 1992), 144-5; hereafter abbreviated as
<i>MR.</i> On this topic, see also Chantal Sundaram, "Manufacturing

"Vladimir Maiakovskii," <i>Pravda,</i> 5 December 1935, 4. Stalin was
responding to a private letter from Lili Brik protesting the neglect
of Mayakovsky's legacy. Some recent scholars have questioned the
extent to which Brik's complaints were justified. Although publishing
res and critical articles suggest that Mayakovsky was not as
neglected as Brik implied, only certain works were being published
in any quantity. For yearly print run tallies, see A. Ezerskaia,
"Maiakovskii v bibliotekakh," <i>Krasnyi bibliotekar'</i> 2 :
3-16. This could mean that Brik's letter was a preemptive strike rather
than a complaint about present conditions, an act meant to protect
the Briks from future persecution. Sundaram has supported this view,
and has suggested that the canonization of Mayakovsky was spurred not by
Brik's personal pleas so much as by Stalin's need for a poet-Stakhanovite
re, a "revolutionary romantic" hero ("MC," 141-3). The <i>Pravda</i>
article, however, addresses almost point-for-point the main complaints
in Brik's letter. It decries the lack of popular editions of his works,
the lack of a museum and library in his former residence, and the
removal of his <i>Vladimir Ilich Lenin</i> and <i>Good!</i> from school
curriculums. The text of Brik's letter has been published several times
in recent years: see Andrei Artizov and Oleg Naumov, comps., <i>Vlast'
i khudozhestvennaia intelligentsia: Dokumenty TsK RKP (b)&#8212;VKP (b),

Lazar Fleischman interprets Stalin's remark as a great relief for
Pasternak, because it removed him from the difficult and dangerous
responsibility of being a <i>Soviet</i> poet. See Lazar Fleischman,
<i>Boris Pasternak: the Poet and his Politics</i> (Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press, 1990), 193. Pasternak's subsequent letter to
Stalin supports this interpretation: "Recently . . . I had begun to be
suspected of serious artistic power. Now, after you placed Mayakovsky
in the first position, this suspicion is lifted from me, and with a
light heart I can live and work as before" (<i>VKI,</i> 275). See also
Pasternak's poem, "To My Liking is the Obstinate Habit" ("Mne po dushe
stroptivyi norov"), in <i>Izvestiia,</i> 1 (January 1936), in which he
contrasts the "Steel poet" and another "endlessly small" poet. (For this
point, and more on Pasternak's response to Stalin, see <i>MR,</i> 145-6.)

See, for example, Edwards Brown, <i>Mayakovsky: A Poet in the
Revolution</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1973) or

Mayakovsky, <i>The Bedbug and Selected Poems,</i> trans. Max Hayward and
George Reavey, ed. Patricia Blake (Bloomington: Indiana University Press,
1975), 9-50. Both of these works end with melancholy acknowledgments of
Mayakovsky's Soviet afterlife and affirmations that this was counter to
his wishes and works. Blake's title refers to Pasternak, making her moral
perspective clear. Svetlana Boym's "The Death of the Revolutionary Poet"
departs from this trend in exploring the myths of the revolutionary poet
that Mayakovsky cultivated in his poetry and that proliferated after his
death. Boym stresses the recurring need for critics to uncover the "real"
Mayakovsky under the Soviet fa&ccedil;ade but she is not concerned with
the concrete cultural mechanisms of canonization. See Svetlana Boym,
"The Death of the Revolutionary Poet," in <i>Death in Quotation Marks:

the Death of Vladimir Mayakovsky: A New Version of the Tragic Events,
Based on Recent Findings in Secret Archives</i>] (Moscow: Zvonnitsa-MG,
1998). In a controversial finding Skoriatin concludes that Mayakovsky
was murdered by the Soviet secret police. See also the recent popular
biographies of Mayakovsky by A. Mikhailov: <i>Tochka puli v kontse</i>
[<i>The Full Stop of a Bullet at the End</i>] (Moscow: Planeta, 1997)
and <i>Zhizn' Maiakovskogo: Ia svoe zemnoe ne dozhil</i> [<i>The Life of

Maiakovskogo</i> [<i>The Resurrection of Mayakovsky</i>] (Munich: Strana

a very negative view of the Briks (occasionally veering into potential
anti-Semitism or personal attack). See for example Vladimir Diadichev,
"Maiakovskii: zhizn' posle smerti (prodolzhenie tragedii)" ["Vladimir

Menzel and Sundaram have begun to critically examine Mayakovsky's
Soviet myth. After a thematic discussion of Mayakovsky's work, Menzel
chronologically traces his reception in the Stalin period, focusing
on four points of reception: 1935, 1940, 1945, and 1954. Sundaram
traces Mayakovsky's "Soviet myth" from the 1920s to the post-Soviet
reconsideration of Mayakovsky in the early 1990s. In part, both authors
are responding to the notorious thesis by Boris Groys that posits an
essential continuity between the Russian avant-garde and the later
Stalinist culture of Socialist Realism. See Boris Groys, <i>The Total
Art of Stalinism,</i> trans. Charles Rougle, (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton
University Press, 1992), originally published as <i>Gesamtkunstwerk
Stalin: die Gespaltene Kultur in der Sowjetunion,</i> (M&uuml;nchen,
1988). Sundaram dissents from what she sees as Menzel's suggestion of a
"contradictory but nevertheless essential continuity between aspects of
the left avant-garde and Socialist Realism" that ultimately supports
Groys' thesis ("MC," 5). She rightly argues that "reception" is not
an appropriate concept for the state's control and promotion of the
"Mayakovsky legend." Despite their differences, both authors trace
Mayakovsky's Soviet image through the decades.

<p>
<a name="FOOT9" href="#REF9">9</a>.
Katerina Clark has noted that during the Stalin period official directives
did not simply oppose alternatives posited by intellectuals but usually
endorsed one position in a currently raging debate. See Katerina
Clark, <i>Petersburg: Crucible of Cultural Revolution</i> (Cambridge,
Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1995), 279. Menzel and Sundaram have
discussed this debate in more detail; see <i>MR,</i> 130-3 and "MC,"
124-31. Sundaram discusses Nikolai Bukharin's address about Mayakovsky
as a balanced, admiring appraisal, and deems the Writer's Congress to be
"the last genuine public debate about Mayakovsky in an official forum
until the late 1980s" ("MC," 126).

<i>Pervyi vsesoiznyi s'ezd sovetskikh pisatelei 1934. Stenograficheskii

speech praising Mayakovsky as a classic revolutionary poet, this phrase
would come back to haunt Bukharin, as he and most former RAPP members
(Leopold Averbakh, Aleksei Selivanovskii, and others) would be arrested
as Trotskyites in 1936-38 (<i>MR,</i> 160).

Many anticipated that official support for Mayakovsky would mean
acceptance of the avant-garde. Paradoxically, however, Mayakovsky's
canonization was accompanied by the suppression of his literary style
(<i>MR,</i> 145-6).

Rachel Schmidt, <i>Critical Images: The Canonization of Don Quixote
through Illustrated Editions of the 18th Century</i> (Montreal:
McGill-Queen's University Press, 1999). Schmidt draws on John Guillory's
studies of literary value and canon formation, which demonstrate how
canonizing authorities try to naturalize the existence of a certain set
of classics as well as promote a certain set of values. See John Guillory,
<i>Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation</i> (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1993).

Referring to textual commentaries on "classic" texts, Iuri Streidter
suggests that critical commentaries not only define the canonized text
but necessarily react to previous commentaries. See Iuri Streidter,
<i>Literary Structure, Evolution, and Value</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard
University Press, l989), 203-4. The idea of "commentary" that I put
forth in this article includes not just criticism but events (exhibits,
conferences, skits) and printed genres (criticism, biography, fiction,
poetry) that perpetuate a view of the author as classic for a given
audience. "Commentary" in this sense is broader then Striedter's usage,
and applies not to a work, but to the author as a cultural re. It
refers not simply to critical response, but to a defining set of texts,
events, and practices that create and sustain value.

I do not mean to imply that the relations between party authorities,
writers, and publishers were static. The degree and kind of party
control over literary processes and res varied throughout the Soviet
period. This topic deserves its own study.

<p>
<a name="FOOT21" href="#REF21">21</a>.
Karen Petrone has made this point in reference to the 1937 Pushkin
celebration; however, it must extend to other literary celebrations as
well. Petrone has stated that the Pushkin Centennial of 1937 "stood at
the crossroads of contradictory discourses of inclusion and exclusion, of
celebration and terror." Karen Petrone, <i>"Life has Become More Joyous,
Comrades": Politics and Culture in Soviet Celebrations</i> (Bloomington:
Indiana University Press, 2000), 115; hereafter abbreviated as <i>PC.</i>
On Stalin's appropriation of the term "intelligentsia" to mean political
as well as cultural res, see Fitzpatrick, <i>Everyday Stalinism,</i>
16. On the "unity of the party and the people" as the real basis for
Socialist Realism, see <i>MSR,</i> 138-45.

<p>
<a name="FOOT22" href="#REF22">22</a>.
See, for example, the numerous reports and testimonials about amateur
Pushkin conferences related to the jubilee that were published in Soviet
newspapers in 1936-37. These have been discussed in part by Petrone;
see <i>PC,</i> 116-20. Newspapers from March and April 1940 repeatedly
describe the joyous preparations of a variety of workers groups, schools,
and citizens reading groups for the Mayakovsky celebration.

Streidter, <i>Literary Structure,</i> 204-6.

<p>
<a name="FOOT24" href="#REF24">24</a>.
The distinction between classic authors and classic texts is often
blurred or ignored in critical discussions of literary canons. This is
particularly important in the Russian context, because the Russian
language itself distinguishes between the classic text and the
classic author. Unlike English, the Russian language has specific
terms that distinguish between <i>klassik</i> (a classic author) and
<i>klassika</i> (classic texts). These two separate concepts have a
complex relationship; most, but not all <i>klassika</i> are written
by a <i>klassik</i>. However, some are not: the <i>Igor Tale,</i>
for instance. An author with a biography is not a required element
of <i>klassika</i>. Moreover, not all texts written by a Russian
<i>klassik</i> are necessarily considered <i>klassika</i>, such as
Gogol's <i>Selected Passages from a Correspondence with Friends,</i>
or Lermontov's pre-1837 poetry.

of the 1937 Pushkin celebration, Lunacharskaia contrasts the 1932 Soviet
Goethe celebration with the one held in Germany: "Just as the hundredth
anniversary of Goethe's death in Fascist Germany distorted the image
of Germany's great poet and suppressed his true merits, the celebration
of this holiday in the Soviet Union unfurled before the proletariat the
great significance of Goethe's work for the culture of humanity" .

Handleman defines public events as "phenomenally valid forms that mediate
persons into collective abstractions by inducing action, knowledge and
experience through these self same forms." See Don Handelman, <i>Models

<p>
<a name="FOOT40" href="#REF40">40</a>.
Several jubilee texts both represent and model transformation explicitly
in portrayals of Mayakovsky's readings. In one jubilee poem depicting
Mayakovsky's performance of his verse, for example, the crowd is
initially presented as a hostile, inarticulate beast. Mayakovsky calms,
transforms, and unifies the audience, giving the power of speech
and understanding. The crowd leaves this performance discussing the
poems amongst themselves. These poems suggest to readers that, like
the revolution, Mayakovsky's readings both educated and humanized the
public. It is implied that these jubilee poems about Mayakovsky can
do the same for the reader in 1940. See Yaroslav Smeliakov, "Vladimir
Maiakovskii," <i>Znamia</i> 4-5 : 121-2.

<p>
<a name="FOOT41" href="#REF41">41</a>.
Handelman's typology does help to illustrate the differences between
Soviet and pre-revolutionary celebrations, but it is only of limited
usefulness in studying how Soviet celebrations worked. He explicitly
states that his typology cannot help define the boundaries of a particular
event, diachronic changes in an event over time, emotional effects
of the event on participants, or relations between different types of
events. See <i>MM,</i> 58. A wider notion of "commentary" allows us to
consider aspects neglected by Handelman's scheme: relationships between
themes, forms, and authors that were part of both published sources
and jubilee events. Future study of the commentary on Mayakovsky will
require including materials published during the anniversary year,
alongside the events that made up the jubilee proper.

The concept of "culturedness" could thus incorporate cultural literacy
into a new value system in a way that mitigated the impression that
the literary classics were part of suspect bourgeois culture. On the
shifting concept of this ideal, and how it could be a tool for both
shaping behavior and leveling social classes, see Catriona Kelly and
Vadim Volkov, "Directed Desires: Kul'turnost' and Consumption," in
<i>Constructing Russian Culture in an Age of Revolution 1881-1940,</i>
ed. Catriona Kelly and David Shepherd (New York: Oxford University Press),
291-314. On "culturism" see Jeffery Brooks, <i>When Russia Learned
to Read: Literacy and Popular Literature 1861-1917,</i> (Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1985), 317-21. Also see Brooks's source
for the term: Edwin Reischauer and John K. Fairbank's <i>East Asia:
The Great Tradition</i> (Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1960), 293. The
Imperial Government's official Pushkin celebration of 1899 can be seen
as a similar, but much more limited attempt to realign this Russian
culturism with official nationality. Soviet celebrations were much more
comprehensive than Imperial Russian celebrations in making culturism
support the official regime.

Though it did not set up and support a <i>Soviet</i> literary canon until
the 1930s, the government had long before moved to control the literary
classics. The Council of People's Commissars decreed on 11 January 1918
that a list of Russian classics were to be published only by the state
publishing agency. Publishing popular editions of the classics then
received top priority. See Maurice Friedberg, <i>Russian Classics in

This can be seen in particular in the many articles on the theme
"Mayakovsky and Pushkin" written in 1937 for the Pushkin celebration. Many
of these explicitly portray the two poets as allegorical representations
of the kinship between the "Golden Age" of Russian poetry and the
Stalin era.

<a name="FOOT52" href="#REF52">52</a>.
See Sergei Tregub, "Solntse sovetskoi poezii" ["The Sun of Soviet
Poetry"], <i>Smena</i> 4 : 9-10. The title of Tregub's 1940 article
references the lone death notice for Pushkin published in 1837 in the
literary supplement to the journal <i>Russkii Invalid,</i> which had
declared simply "the Sun of Russian poetry has set." The quotation
highlights the inherent ambiguities in the state's promotion of the
two poets. Many writers in the years immediately after Mayakovsky's
suicide in 1930 had interpreted his death as a symbolic recurrence of
Pushkin's death, an expression of the "poet's fate" in Russia. Roman
Jakobson made this connection in the well-known article, "On a Generation
that Squandered its Poets" ["O pokolenii, rastrativshem svoikh poetov"]
. Pasternak's poem "The Death of the Poet"  also referenced
the connection, its intertextual allusion to Lermontov's verse indicting
society for Pushkin's 1837 death by dueling. In declaring Mayakovsky
the "Sun of Soviet Poetry," Tregub (perhaps intentionally) raises the
underlying issue of the poet's death in a time of autocracy, a subject
with less than positive connotations for the Soviet government in
the 1930s.

<p>
<a name="FOOT53" href="#REF53">53</a>.
Between December 1935 and February 1937, at least ten articles were
published in major newspapers and journals on the theme "Mayakovsky and

this amount of attention in the same period.

See <i>PC,</i> 10-1. In fact, I would stress that literary celebrations
were the main source of the new ideal of Soviet "high" culture
as a unified tradition incorporating all the Soviet republics,
but of course led by Russian literary tradition. See also Petrone's
discussion of the 1937 Pushkin celebration's symbolic representation
of the brother republics embracing Pushkin as part of their "native"
tradition (<i>PC,</i> 129-31). National unity was also represented by
the parallel events held for the literary res of other republics.

Alekseeva discusses one jubilee exhibit that was never opened, despite
extensive preparation. She attributes this to controversies among the
organizing committee over the extent to which Mayakovsky's biography
and work should be censored. She concludes that, in the context of the
museum exhibit, the new Soviet myth imposed on Mayakovsky's image was
ultimately impossible to reconcile with the documentary materials (photos,
manuscripts, letters) that an exhibition required. See "DLS," 186.

The extent to which the public believed the rhetoric of the Mayakovsky
celebration is unclear. The resolution of this question in regards
to the massive cultural undertaking of jubilees must involve Slavoj
&#157;Zi&#157;zek's recent position that the "culture industry"
of the type described by Adorno does not exist in totalitarian
societies, whose regimes do not intend to cultivate actual belief in
the ruling ideology. i ek suggests that totalitarian regimes operate on
"cynical reason," which acknowledges and exists in the gap between the
ideological mask of the regime and the reality. "Cynical reason," in
&#157;Zi&#157;zek's formulation, does not expect to create the illusion
of truth; instead it uses "extra-ideological violence and the promise
of gain" to secure its subject's obedience. Applying "cynical reason"
to institutions like the Mayakovsky celebration might suggest that it
was not meant to inculcate belief in the official Mayakovsky myth, but
was merely a means to secure complicity in the system that allowed the
state to dictate literary and cultural worth, production of texts, and
literary value. &#157;Zi&#157;zek's theory, however, does not account
for the potential for variation, the possibility that the "industry"
of the celebration was to present truth to some, and complicity to
others. However, his theory does suggest the possibility that the
"mass inculcation of Mayakovsky into the national consciousness" (as
Alekseeva phrased it) was not necessarily the celebration organizers'
main goal. This issue cannot be resolved here, but suggests the need for
future study of the literary celebration. See Slavoj &#157;Zi&#157;zek,
"How Did Marx Invent the Symptom?" in <i>Mapping Ideology,</i> ed. Slavoj
&#157;Zi&#157;zek, (London: Verso, 1994), 212-3.

Published memoirs and testimonials often describe a citizen overcoming
a previous dislike or misunderstanding of the poet's work. The numerous
amateur conferences no doubt were intended to support the idea of public
reading as a way to "comprehend" Mayakovsky or to display one's own
erudition. See the account of one technician, N. Progrov, published in
a newspaper article:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I have read almost all of Mayakovsky's works. In the beginning, I
understood them with difficulty, because I didn't know how to read. Then I
began to practice reading aloud and gradually assimilated his style. I was
convinced, that in each poem of Mayakovsky's, even a small one, there is
a deep meaning. Now Mayakovsky is my very favorite poet. I have acquired
a full collection of his works. I read through them over and over again.

"Why We Love Mayakovsky":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Not long ago I met a man who, having never read Mayakovsky's poetry,
began to vehemently judge it "incomprehensible." Of course, this is
nonsense. Mayakovsky is comprehensible to all who know how to read
thoughtfully and not rush through the book at a gallop. I once read to
my comrades, the workers of our factory, the poem about Ivan Kozyrev,
about Nette, about the Soviet passport. They asked me to read more and
more . . .

A similar point is made by Menzel, who finds characteristics of the
Socialist Realist hero in several of the biographical texts published in
1940 (see <i>MR,</i> 163-71). More specifically, I would argue that the
jubilee texts and events not only assigned Socialist Realist character
traits to Mayakovsky, but produced a biographical narrative that draws
on the "master plot" of Socialist Realism that Katerina Clark outlined in
her definitive study <i>The Soviet Novel: History as Ritual</i> (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1981); hereafter abbreviated as <i>SN.</i>
This <i>narrative</i> of evolution from "spontaneity" to "consciousness"
is the ultimate pattern to which Mayakovsky's biography is subjugated;
the literary celebration's traditional focus on the author's biography
cultivated this model most effectively. The jubilee created a heroic
narrative for Mayakovsky as an evolution in revolutionary consciousness
manifested in meetings with mentor res that always resulted in more
profound, revolutionary creative activity. I have written about this in
my dissertation: "Creating the First Classic Poet of Socialist Realism:
Mayakovsky as a Subject of 'Celebration Culture' 1935-1940" (University
of Chicago, 2002).

<p>
<a name="FOOT75" href="#REF75">75</a>.

Mayakovsky did underground work for the communist party in Moscow as a
juvenile in 1908-10 and was imprisoned twice. He abandoned party work
before beginning his poetic career with the "Cubo-Futurist" group in
1912. He never belonged to the party as an adult. His early years of party
work were, of course, emphasized in 1940 as the genesis of his supposed
"evolution toward communism."

<p>
<a name="FOOT77" href="#REF77">77</a>.
See Mayakovsky's suicide note, as reproduced in the newspaper
<i>Komsomolskaia Pravda</i> on 15 April 1930: "Comrade Government,
my family is Lili Brik, my mother, my sisters, and Vera Vitoldovna
Polonskaia. If you can arrange a bearable life for them&#8212;thank you."

<a name="FOOT78" href="#REF78">78</a>.
On other jubilee texts about Gorky and Mayakovsky that portrayed a close
relationship between the two, see <i>MR,</i> 169-70. Menzel does not
see this relationship as part of the Socialist Realist novelization
of Mayakovsky's biography, but as part of the larger project to link
Mayakovsky to Soviet authorities such as Lenin, Stalin, and Gorky.

<p>
<a name="FOOT79" href="#REF79">79</a>.
Maria Andreeva, "Iz vospominanii" ["From My Memories"], <i>Pravda</i>
(13 April 1940): 4. These jubilee texts simplify a relationship not
always so cordial. Lili Brik later suggested directly that Mayakovsky's
relationship with Gorky was misrepresented in Soviet criticism (<i>MR,</i>
170). See also Katanian, <i>Lilia Brik,</i> 32-4; Katanian describes
how Mayakovsky discovered that Gorky had spread unfounded rumors that
Mayakovsky had given a young girl syphilis and then blackmailed her
parents. This incident and Mayakovsky's subsequent falling-out with Gorky
are never cited in jubilee articles. Viktor Shklovsky seems to be the only
jubilee writer who mentioned this incident and its aftermath. See Viktor
Shklovsky, <i>O Maiakovskom</i> [<i>About Mayakovsky</i>; published in
English as <i>Mayakovsky and his Circle,</i> trans. Lily Feiler (New York:
Dodd, Mead, 1972)], (Moscow: Sovetskii Pisatel', 1940), 117-8.

The distance between urban and rural Soviet life has been revealingly
demonstrated by Veronica Gorres, Natalia Korenevskaia, and Thomas
Lahusen, the editors of <i>Intimacy and Terror.</i> By juxtaposing
quotations from the newspaper <i>Izvestiia</i> with diary entries
written by a peasant collective farm worker, this volume effectively
shows how the countryside operated with a different set of concerns,
priorities, and timetables than city life. The Pushkin celebration that
filled the pages of <i>Izvestiia</i> in 1937 leaves no trace in the farm
worker's diary. See <i>Intimacy and Terror,</i> ed. Veronica Gorres,
Natalia Korenevskaia, and Thomas Lahusen, trans. Carol Flath (New York:
The New Press, 1995).

<i>MR,</i> 135. Chertok suggests that this article created a "new
category of crime" ("<i>novyi sostav prestupleniia</i>"); he points out
that Stalin directed his reply not to Brik herself, but to Ezhov, the
head of the secret police, suggesting the potential punishment for this
new "crime." See Simon Chertok, <i>Posledniaia liubov Maiakovskogo</i>
[<i>Mayakovsky's Last Love</i>], (Ann Arbor, Mich.: Ermitazh, 1983),
39. An article titled "Indifference" ("Bezrazlichie") published in 1937
makes the threat implied in the statement quite explicit:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
There is no doubt that members of the Writer's Union Committee of the
Byelorussian republic . . . remember well the words of comrade Stalin
about Mayakovsky. They are well acquainted with not only the high
evaluation which comrade Stalin gave Mayakovsky, but also the words
stating that indifference to Mayakovsky's memory and his works is a
crime. However, it is one thing to remember, and another to understand
that they must make practical conclusions from these words . . .

police. See "MC," 160-1. It seems equally likely that their arrest might
have tainted the reputation of the State Poet.

Several articles by Yakhontov were published in 1936-40 about this

several programs for Mayakovsky jubilee events.

Menzel notes that Akhmatova published this poem after years of being
unable to publish work; see <i>MR,</i> 150. However, Akhmatova had
published scholarship for the Pushkin celebration in 1937; in 1940 she
published this poem in <i>Maiakovskomu</i> [<i>To Mayakovsky</i>], as
well as a volume of her own poetry, <i>Iz shesti knig</i> [<i>From Six
Books</i>]. The door to publication may have been opened for Akhmatova
before the celebration. It is clear, however, that this poem enabled her
first public performance for years, suggesting that the jubilee allowed
Akhmatova to reconnect with an audience.

one of texts (examples) and one "regularizing canon" in which the norms
for text production are defined. Though acknowledging the primary
role of institutions in the canonization process, G&uuml;nther does
not consider the role of literary and cultural institutions, or the
individual writer. Both Clark and G&uuml;nther's theoretical discussions
of Socialist Realism pointedly omit poetry.
