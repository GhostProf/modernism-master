<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A few words suffice to let the incidents speak for themselves when
writing about Marinetti as father, poet, human being, or intimate
friend. Marinetti--that was how his friends called him, and my mother,
too; <I>pap&agrave;</I>--an affectionate father, humorous, considerate,
and a deeply devoted companion to Beny (Benedetta). Me--Luce, the third
daughter. As my father was no longer quite so young, my mother, who was
much younger, liked to keep me close by. After his first heart attack
he dubbed me his little "nurse."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From the day he passed away, real and unreal accumulate in the effort
to rediscover and understand him better, and not just in memory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He introduced me to a very large world. When I was a little girl he would
respond to all of my curious questions. Very simply, he would explain
his poetry, Futurism, his philosophical and social principles, and he
would read his poems, teaching me the importance of declamation. Taking
my hands, he loved to draw sketches of Futurist architecture, which had
been prevented from being realized during the <I>ventennio</I>,
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 and thus he taught me the essential importance of line and space, always
 with his optimistic and enthusiastic desire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He took extreme pains to appreciate and give guidance to young people
who turned to him, not just by encouraging them, but above all by
believing in them. From my earliest childhood I would sit and listen to
him, enchanted and hypnotized. He possessed a gift for describing every
episode and every detail of his adventurous past with such a variety of
images that he seemed to be living them right then and there. I came to
understand how much he had adored his own mother

<B></B>

when, with deep emotion, he recounted the long walks he took together
with her on the beaches of Alexandria in front of their house by the sea.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He liked to be by himself near the sea and always selected houses that
were remote and isolated, whether on Capri, Levanto, or Elba, perhaps to
rediscover the same Mediterranean landscapes and relive his childhood:
his mother, his father, his brother Leone, who had died so young. Capri
became our special island, and pap&agrave; termed it "the reclining
chair of the Mediterranean." Every time we approached it together on the
steamer I could sense by his very words that his poetic vigor was being
magically infused with the Mediterranean sun of his childhood, and my
childish mind was filled with turbulence, love, poetry, and beauty.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At Capri, when not writing, he amused himself by going down with us to
Marina Piccola among the rocks and the sea, watching us dive into the
water vibrating with sun and color. In the afternoon, after a brief
pause for silence and concentration, he invited me to join him in long
walks. It was during one of our last stays on Capri that he came along
with me to Mount Tiberio on the back of a donkey. From the top of the
mountain, where the rocks plunge directly into the sea, we could view
the entire gulf of Naples and the coast of Amalfi, and this colorful
triumph of nature provoked the most profound emotions. He talked to me
about his campaign for the defense of the natural landscape of Capri in
the twenties, and he explained to me the fascinating game played by the
rocks, which seem so cruel to me, when they plunge straight into the
sweet warm sea--and thus he brought me to understand the dangerous and
seductive link between life, good, and evil.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We used to stop in Naples in the interval between the arrival of the
ferry and the departure of the train, and we spent a great deal of
time in Don Gaspare Casella's bookstore at Largo Castello. Don Gaspare
was an intellectual, a collector of manuscripts and autographs, and a
publisher. His shop was a meeting place for great minds, a place for
intellectual encounters; dropping in at the bookshop-cum-work-shop on
any given day, you might see Bontempelli, Bragaglia, Malaparte, Edwin
Cerio, or Cangiullo.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 And every time we stopped in Naples <I>pap&agrave;</I> seized the
 opportunity to visit his friend. I used to come along, happy and
 curious. A social visit could suddenly be transformed into a fencing
 match: they discussed concepts, plans, and projects, delighting in
 their debates, and a ferment of ideas would arise and I would listen
 with fascination, so that every visit became a theater in which the
 actors were grand yet familiar res.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our summers were quite long, our winters brief: Capri was an international
drawing room, a source of imaginative inspiration, a <I>cenacle</I> of
creative, daring minds. <I>Pap&agrave;</I> loved to swim. Water was the
source of life for him, a prenatal poetic analogy; he used to stop and
look into the depths of the water with its thousand colors and shades,
at once dark and crystalline. He taught me to swim, and to observe the
shadings of the water, in order to understand art and life. Thus he
taught me to defy the world without hesitation, and at the same time to
seize whatever is beautiful in life and exalt it. We would go to places
that only he knew how to find, grottos with magical reflections of light,
and we would swim among the rocks and eat shellfish and gather seashells
and starfish.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When we went back to Rome and our house on Piazza Adriana, which was
also the Headquarters of the Futurist Movement, we returned to life
at a dynamic pace--travels, telephone calls, Futurists, secretaries,
comings and goings. The walls were painted in a variety of colors,
and the big sitting rooms overlooked the gardens of Castel S. Angelo,
the Tomb of Hadrian. The sun-yellow walls recalled the reflections of
the Roman sky and the colors of the nearby houses at sunset. The blue
sitting room was furnished with Arab furniture that marked the presence of
<I>pap&agrave;'s</I> childhood and house in Alexandria. In the other rooms
and halls, Futurist sculptures were our lifelong companions, Futurist
paintings rendered the walls dynamic, and together they formed a stage
that served as the chorus for visitors and special guests. The presence
of the Arab furniture mirrored the spirit of Marinetti even more, in its
sublime contrast between past and future, in a deep cultural foundation
necessary to actualize a new world of creativity and feeling.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the part of the house opposite the vast entrance was the lounge
that opened into the dining room designed for Marinetti by Enrico
Prampolini. From the back of the entrance hall ran a long hallway
that served as a library and led to <I>pap&agrave;'s</I> study and the
bedrooms. I used to love that hallway: the bookshelves ran all the way
up to the ceiling, filled with colorful books suggesting stories that
would never end, and I used to climb up the tall ladder in defiance of
<I>pap&agrave;'s</I> orders when he was searching for a book. I would
follow him from one bookcase to another and amuse myself by pursuing
the tiny book-eating insects that were impertinently running from one
part of the shelves to another and which <I>pap&agrave;</I> was always
trying to eliminate, even though he also tried to justify them in my
eyes by calling them the only really persistent readers!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over by the opposite wall was the stark study: a large desk filled with
papers; a glass-doored wardrobe that guarded his writings; papers and
newspapers everywhere, piles of letters that his secretary would send
off every day; and the voice of <I>pap&agrave;</I> giving dictation--a
pure and metallic voice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Towards evening the sitting rooms would fill up with artists, writers,
composers, friends, all of them familiar presences for me. My mother
would urge me to return to my studies, while I would try to escape from
our German housemaid, hiding behind the curtains.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I was born in Rome beneath Boccioni's painting <I>The Soccer Player</I>,
now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York; <I>pap&agrave;</I>
decided to call me <I>Luce</I>, which means "light" in Italian, an
unusual name that for him was the symbol of a new era, swifter than
sound. First memories? The balcony that overlooked Piazza Adriana,
where <I>pap&agrave;</I> would pause at length in contemplation of
Hadrian's tomb and its gardens. He became rather less contemplative
when his glance fell upon the Palazzo degli Invalidi, constructed by
the architect Piacentini
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 in 1928, and a typical expression of architecture during the
 <I>ventennio</I>; excitedly he would cite various manifestos and theories
 of Futurist architecture, showing me designs by Sant'Elia and Marchi
 and explaining their significance to me. I began to understand what he
 had struggled for.

<B></B>

Later, as if still in pursuit of that magical moment of contemplation, he
would sit down in front of the old harmonium brought from Alexandria; he
used to love to play and compose, and without a score he would fluently
play Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin...precious Chinese vases were sitting
atop the large musical instrument while lights, filtered through the
great oriental lamps that had inspired the first Futurist manifesto, were
playing mysteriously over the inlaid work of the furniture brought from
Alexandria; Persian rugs covered the floors, one atop another, creating
an atmosphere so different and so intimate that I seemed to be living in
a dream world, and even the paintings and sculptures made by cultivated
guests would grow respectfully silent and listen. Together we would go
back in time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My mother, a Piedmontese who was reserved and severe, decided that we
shouldn't grow up in an atmosphere so continually agitated: our house
was open to everyone, and outside the entrance door was a plaque that
read: FUTURIST MOVEMENT. So we were registered as day students at the
School of the Sacred Heart at the Trinit&agrave; dei Monti in Rome. I
didn't like this decision.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When I took my first Communion, I also had my first important
confrontation with my father. After preparation and retreat prior to
Communion, the "Mothers," for so we called the Sisters, had asked us
to urge our parents to receive the sacrament as well. I didn't yet
know the meaning of "a book on the Index" and even less the meaning
of "excommunication." Coming home that evening, I waited until after
dinner. As usual there were many visitors, and I felt drawn this way and
that about the request of the Mothers. Intuition or fear? Certainly a
problem difficult to resolve, and I felt ill at ease. <I>Pap&agrave;</I>
was surprised when I asked to speak with him, and looked at me with an
inquisitive expression. Our conversations had always been very natural,
and he clearly intuited that something was disturbing me. As soon as we
were alone in his study, the request came gushing forth out of my mouth,
as if I were extracting something from inside me that was oppressing
me...I noticed that <I>pap&agrave;</I> was deeply ill at ease, and his
face had turned red...he waited a little while before replying. To me
it seemed an eternity. I was already reproaching myself for having done
what the Mothers had asked. Then he took me by the hand and made me
sit on his knee. He explained to me the significance of being a poet,
he explained to me the significance of imagination and suffering, when
agony and spirituality are united to overflow in analogies that go beyond
the human and beyond the stars...he
<BR>
recounted the history of Italy to me with its anticlerical struggles,
which did not necessarily mean that one was antireligious. He spoke to
me at length about God. I was angry at the Sisters who had brought me to
this pass, but later I was happy: their mistake was a coarse one, but it
had brought about an unforgettable encounter with <I>pap&agrave;</I>. I
used to be amused when my father would tell me about the <I>serate
futuriste</I>, or Futurist evenings, identifying the people who
had surrounded him and declaiming his words-in-freedom poems, all
theatricalized by his formidable gifts as a mimic and his extraordinary
voice, modulating words from sonorous to metallic to explosive. I used to
see him on the stages of Italy and abroad, unflappable, lucid, terrifying,
witty, waging battle implacably against whatever was static in all forms
of life, deliberately

<B></B>

involving the spectators in order to dislodge them from intellectual
lethargy: "a revolutionary in black tie." For me, at any rate, it was
far more fascinating and amusing to listen to him than to play little
theatrical games by myself in my room, among the puppets and the furniture
designed by the Futurist painter Giacomo Balla.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From early on I understood that <I>pap&agrave;</I> had a gift for
transforming the difficulties of life into play, into challenge, into
happiness. One time, in Bologna, the entire family had come together on
the occasion of a Futurist performance that was being given in a private
theater attached to the villa of a friend. We were staying at the famous
Grand Hotel Baglioni, a place charged with historical associations,
one that had traditionally hosted the most celebrated personalities of
the time. In the morning when we ordered breakfast, it was apparent
that the waiter was deeply moved by the presence of Marinetti, and
as he began to bring in the food he had difficulty balancing the two
large trays brimming with cups, teapots, coffee, chocolate, brioches,
and marmalade. <I>Pap&agrave;</I>, observing his acrobatic maneuvers,
whispered in my ear, "It looks like a Futurist dance!" But as the waiter
approached our table his shoe got caught in an impertinent crease in
the carpet and, doing a pirouette as he tried to save the trays and
their contents, he fell to the floor: an explosion of tea, coffee, cups
and glasses, chocolate, brioches...my father was soaked with all these
tidbits. There was silence, and a panic-stricken expression on the face
of the poor waiter, blushing with embarrassment. Then came an explosion of
laughter from my father, who added: "Bravo! Good fellow, you've performed
a perfect and very theatrical form of Futurist aviation!" Reassured,
the hapless waiter left the room.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After my father had a hernia operation in 1941 we spent the summer at
Forte dei Marmi, Viareggio, along the coast of Tuscany, staying in a
dependance of the Villa Pellizzi, where the road skirting the sea cut
across the space between our garden and the shore. A grove of pine trees
alleviated the summer sultriness, and <I>pap&agrave;</I> often thought
back nostalgically to the crags of Capri. He amused himself by visiting
the village market once a week. He would stop to observe the carts
loaded with so many multicolored straws and the colorful nets that the
women would entwine and use as belts. Perhaps in his mind's eye he was
still observing the fireworks of Piedigrotta at Naples. The fourteenth
of August was my mother's birthday, and that year my father asked me to
go with him to help choose a gift. "Not just poems and poetry!" he said,
for in fact it was his habit to dedicate poems to her. We came back with
purses, lit-tle wallets, hair brushes large and small. Mother
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 was a bit vain, and she would surely love them. But so many! And all
 alike! I didn't dare say a word to him, for he was like a child who
 had gone crazy in his desire to please her with a surprise. And when
 he gave them to her she was deeply moved and smiled warmly. A little
 over a year passed, and then my father had a difficult operation for an
 ulcer, performed by the magical hand of Dr. Raffaele Bastianelli, a dear
 friend of <I>pap&agrave;</I>. When he left the hospital he had to remain
 immobile in bed, but his vigor was still such that he wanted to continue
 receiving his friends, poets, writers, musicians, notwithstanding the
 doctor's firm orders for absolute rest. So the first sitting room was
 organized as his bedroom,

<B></B>

near the entrance, so that he could receive guests without having
to move. When not receiving visits he would write, dictating to his
secretary or jotting down his thoughts in the tiny notebooks that followed
him throughout the course of his life, from trains to battlefields:
reflections on his state of mind, notes about meetings, plans, theories,
bits of writings, words-in-freedom, scenes for plays, drafts, political
opinions, always just at hand in his pocket.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite the prohibition of Bastianelli, <I>pap&agrave;</I> wanted to go as
a volunteer to the Russian front in 1942, during the Second World War. So
that our thoughts would always be with him, my sisters and I sewed his
name on the inside of his personal belongings, adding the word POET (he
had requested it). We accompanied him all the way to Verona, where the
military transport train was scheduled to depart. It was a torrid day
in July, and <I>pap&agrave;</I> helped to keep up our spirits, despite
the sad occasion.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His letters from Russia were brief and affectionate, and always
contained a flower that he had gathered on the steppe, always a message
of encouragement. He returned in the beginning of 1943 on the last
train to leave before the great retreat, looking like a shadow in his
large mantle. His first heart attack occurred after a lecture at the
Italian Academy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the following months his condition worsened. His immense sorrow at
seeing Italy divided into two parts weighed heavily on his health and
spirits. Doctor Bastianelli suggested trying to find a quieter city.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In October of 1943 we moved to Venice, where we occupied an old palazzo
on the Grand Canal. To the left was the Rialto, and opposite us on
the other bank were the vegetable and fish markets. We learned that
our building had once been occupied by Aretino, the famous comedian,
poet, man of letters, and adventurous spirit of the high Renaissance,
and <I>pap&agrave;</I> was highly amused.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His study overlooked the Grand Canal and had a little terrace. He wrote
or dictated day and night, without pause. In his poetic imagination the
Grand Canal was being transformed and the dimensions of Venice altered. He
wrote his last words-in-freedom poem, "A Convention on the Grand Canal":
the "slow luxurious vaporetto" became a rapid train; the Rialto became
a Nordic railroad station; he gathered together the languid smiles of
the Venetian women...and urged Venice to stop lamenting the past and
her memories, and to begin to live with hope, as the Futurists did.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Marinetti used to pass many hours on the balcony, intently observing
the traffic of the little boats that slowly made their way up the Grand
Canal, filled with produce, heading toward the market to unload whatever
fruits and vegetables the war still permitted. The winter was cold, humid,
hostile. Only a handful of friends came to visit him now. Foodstuffs
were scarce, and water, too. The bridge uniting Venice with the mainland
had been bombed. By turns we would fill up large bottles with water,
after a long wait at one of the small <I>campielli</I> that had a public
fountain. Our house was damp and cold because of the lack of heating,
the certainly this did nothing to help my father's state of health.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One evening, it must have been very late, <I>pap&agrave;</I> was
correcting his latest writings in his study, while my sisters and I were
studying; suddenly there was an insistent

<B></B>

ringing of the doorbell, coming from the large door that gave directly
onto a narrow street. Under the Portico Dolfin, voices with a foreign
accent; forceful knocking--two German officials entered the house and
asked for Marinetti. My mother stopped them at the door. Even now I can
see <I>pap&agrave;</I> leaving his study wearing his long full robe. He
ordered us to go to our rooms with a gesture and a look. He stepped into
the long entrance hall, keeping his hands in his pockets. He exchanged
only a few words with the officials...they wanted to search the house,
but after a brief discussion my father brusquely showed them the door.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the end of July 1943 we left Venice, stopping for two months
at Sal&ograve; on the shores of Lake Sirmione, where we stayed
until 20 September. The memory of those days is hardly a happy
one. <I>Pap&agrave;</I> was suffering and growing steadily worse. My
mother attempted to resolve our logistical problems, but it was an
extremely difficult time and there were financial problems. My father
had offered various newspapers his collaboration, but his proposals were
rejected; he received nothing from the Academy; and his books were no
longer being published. He tried to use optimism in order to combat the
deep sadness that was increasingly perceptible in his face. Though his
health was plainly worsening, he never complained and he continued to
work on a number of different projects at the same time, as if intending
actually to accelerate the rhythm of his life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On 19 September my father, mother, and I had to leave Sal&ograve;
for Como, where my sisters were awaiting us. By now my father had to
remain lying in bed because he was so tired, and his pulse was far
above normal; my mother and I would always be in his room to keep him
company. Somebody sounded the bell at the door of the villa; but the
gate, which was at the head of the entrance drive, had been left closed
and was difficult to climb: it was very high, and the wall that enclosed
the substantial garden was surmounted by a crest of cement containing
pieces of broken bottles interwoven with barbed wire. The garden, which
surrounded the entire house, ended at the back in a little inlet of the
lake, with a small dock for boats. The alarmed expressions of my mother
and father increased my fear; I understood that something serious was
happening. They both approached the entrance door, and an agitated
dialogue ensued between the parties on the two sides of the door. My
parents asked the visitors their identity; standing farther back from the
door, I couldn't understand their reply, except for one word: Open. My
mother asked me to telephone a friend of ours, gave me the number, and
I went to get help. <I>Pap&agrave;</I> did not feel well and had to lie
down, and I stayed close to him, counting his pulse and keeping track
of the increase in his heartbeat. In one hand he was holding a revolver.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mother went to the phone to make sure that help had really been
sent. Outside, beyond the door, there was absolute silence. I managed
to quiet <I>pap&agrave;</I>. The bell rang from the main gate that
opened onto the street. The house was separated from the street by a
long driveway that was flanked by tall trees. My mother asked me to go
and open the gate. I walked down the long dark driveway alone, hearing
creaking sounds everywhere, and once again I silently thanked my father
for encouraging me to walk around the house in the dark when we lived
in Rome, a way to conquer my

<B></B>

fears and learn to have a greater "tactile" sensibility. Finally I arrived
at the gate and could hear voices...excited voices...then two shots, and
I hid in the shrubbery...and at last I heard the password and I opened
the gate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Upon my return, <I>pap&agrave;</I> seemed much quieter.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At five in the morning, Mr. Hidaka, the Japanese ambassador, came to
bid farewell to his friend the poet, and later, with a car and escort
furnished by the Japanese embassy, we left the villa, scraping together a
few final possessions, especially <I>pap&agrave;'s</I> papers. During the
journey my father smiled reassuringly. Late in the afternoon we arrived
at Lora, on Lake Como. It had been a long journey, and often we had to
stop to take cover in ditches excavated alongside the road to escape the
machine-guns of the airplanes. I was happy to see my sisters and for us
all to be united once more.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The days weighed on our spirits, and the atmosphere was destructive,
obsessive. <I>Pap&agrave;</I> fought against our gloomy mood with
poetry. It was like magic, and we listened to it and loved it. After a
pause of a few days we departed for Cadenabbia, also on the lake.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was in that odd and out-of-the-way place, so rarely visited by my
father, that I had the good fortune to discover part of the world of his
childhood. In a home that lodged elderly people in a beautiful villa on
the lake there lived one of <I>pap&agrave;'s</I> aunts; to me, a child,
she seemed to be more than a hundred years old. She was dignified, a
bit stiff, affectionate in a limited way once thought suitable for the
haute bourgeoisie; she wore a velvet choker at her neck, was delicate,
slim, with long and beautiful hands, and with white hair arranged in a
chignon at the back of her neck; she seemed a creature from an unreal
world. I had never met close or distant relatives of my father, nor had
my mother, who was much younger than him. It left a great impression on
me when <I>pap&agrave;</I> hugged this slender woman who called him "Tom."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was the world of his childhood, of which I had heard him and others
speak often, now reappearing for the first time in a strange and tragic
context, as if the end were linking back up with the beginning; I
was observing <I>pap&agrave;</I>, who was deeply moved. Egypt and his
childhood were returning to him with all their power: his father, his
mother, his brother.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After a few days we moved from Cadenabbia to Bellagio, where we stayed
in two rooms of the Hotel Splendido, offered by ambassador Hidaka. The
machine-gunning from the planes was growing more common, and ferries
and steamers would arrive from the lake badly shop up, transformed into
collective biers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I continued my studies in a school on the hill in back of Bellagio,
and it was because of an ugly fall on the gravel in one of the many
ball games that we played that I came to spend my last days with
<I>pap&agrave;</I>. Mother had to go away, and I was to take on the role
of "the little nurse," as father had christened me. For some time already
I had been familiar with simple ways of slowing down his accelerated
heartbeat. I used to sleep in his room, not far from him. Even when he
was sleeping, <I>pap&agrave;</I> would apparently be creating poems,
which he wrote down the next morning. Sometimes at night he would light
a lamp to jot down some notes, and if I were

<B></B>

awake he would read them aloud to me. I was fascinated, but also afraid
that he would become agitated and then tired. He was always seized with
great emotion when he would read aloud, especially in the final days when
he was correcting his last poem, dedicated to young people. I lived for
two final days beside him, days full of affection, tenderness, and love.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A week later he left us forever.

in the manner of Carducci, he was transformed by his war experiences
into an advocate of the avant-garde and Futurism. He became a member of

<I>Anton Giulio Bragaglia</I> (1890-1960) and <I>Carlo Ludovico
Bragaglia</I> (1894-    ): film directors, stage directors, and
theatrical producers. Anton Giulio proposed a theoretical basis for
Futurist photography in 1911, though his work aroused resistance from
some of the Futurist painters. He directed several films and in 1918
founded an art gallery in Rome that sponsored exhibitions of works by
Balla, Boccioni, De Chirico, and the Dadaists, eventually totaling more
than 275 shows. In 1922 he founded the Teatro degli Indipendenti, which
performed new works by Marinetti, Pirandello, Soffici, Schnitzler, and
Apollinaire. He was also a prolific journalist, critic, and reviewer. His
brother Carlo Ludovico was an active collaborator in both the gallery
and the theater, though he wrote relatively little.

<I>Curzio Malaparte</I> (1898-1957): political activist, journalist, and
essayist. After serving in the war, Malaparte became an early member
of the Fascist Party; he participated in the March on Rome in 1922,
joined with Bontempelli in editing the journal <I>"900"</I> in 1926,
then broke with him and created another journal. He was charged with
antifascist activity for his book <I>Technique du coup d'etat</I> 
and sentenced to five years in prison, though released early. He served
as a correspondent in World War II and in 1944 wrote <I>Kaputt</I>, a
macabre masterpiece, based on his experiences. After the war he wrote
several novels.

<I>Edwin Cerio</I> (1875-1960): engineer and essayist. After a
successful career as a naval engineer, he returned to his native island
of Capri where he became mayor (1920-23) and an active proponent of
conservation. He edited a cultural journal called <I>Le pagine dell'isola
di Capri</I> (1921-22), which had a slightly Futurist orientation and was
open to intellectuals who visited the island. He wrote numerous books
about Capri, its history, and its inhabitants and guests, some of them
published by the book dealer Casella.

<I>Marcello Piacentini</I> (1881-1960): an architect whose vaguely
classicizing style and prominence in the National Union of Architects
enabled him to formulate the eclectic and rhetorical <I>stile Littorio</I>
(Lictorial Style) that became the "official" party manner after 1932. He
is best known for his work as chief architect of the Citt&agrave;
Universitaria complex (1932-35), the Esposizione Universale Roma 42 or EUR
complex , and for the via della Riconcilizione (1936-50), the broad
avenue leading to Saint Peter's. The building referred to here, also known
as the Casa Madre dei Mutilati , is rectangular with a facade in
tufa and travertine marble, the whole surmounted by a curious belvedere.
