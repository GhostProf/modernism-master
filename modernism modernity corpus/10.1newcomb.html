<p>
American poets became modernist in the 1910s not merely by embracing a new
set of formal techniques, but by immersing themselves in the milieu of
the machine-age metropolis. Poetry's turn in subject matter has always
been neglected because it contravenes the long-consensual view that
modernism was defined by its repudiation of urban-industrial modernity.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 But one of the salient facts of early modernism is this: beginning
 suddenly around 1911, a vast range of American poets, whose predecessors
 had largely shunned modern subjects, took up the industrial city as
 a challenge, and an opportunity, to reimagine poetry's value for the
 twentieth century. Their willingness to engage with urban modernity
 may have been crucial to the very continuation of poetry in the United
 States. In the decades since the Civil War, as American life came to
 be defined more and more by the impersonal terms of urban experience,
 custodians of the nation's verse had stubbornly refused to engage with
 these actualities, creating a crisis in which many predicted poetry
 would simply wither away as "the rickety dream-child of neurotic
 aestheticism."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 The many verses of the 1910s about skyscrapers, subway travel, movies,
 vaudeville shows, baseball games, automated lunchrooms, and other
 aggressively modern subjects, were responses to that crisis equally
 as crucial to modernism's rejuvenating capacity as poets' adoption
 of free verse or Imagist techniques of representation. These verses
 asserted American poetry's ability to recreate itself as relevant to
 modern American life.

<b></b>

<p>
The richest category of this early twentieth-century urban verse is
perhaps cityscape poetry, which employs a variety of representational
strategies to evoke the metropolitan environment in panoramic visual
terms.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 The icon of modernity most potent in American cityscape poetry was
 the great building, a structure of unprecedented physical scale and
 grandeur that punctuated the burgeoning industrial metropolis. Most
 modern great buildings possessing this iconic power were venues for
 commerce, transport, or amusement, public not usually in ownership
 but in spatial accessibility, designed to accommodate a large number
 and variety of occupants, both permanent and transient. American
 verse written between 1910 and 1925 exhibits a persistent fascination
 with several types of modern great buildings&#8212;railroad stations,
 department stores, hotels, theaters, sports arenas&#8212;but most of
 all with the skyscraper.

<p>
The skyscraper is the central visual symbol of capitalist modernity,
as September 2001 forcibly reminded us, and has been so for a hundred
years. To American poets of the early twentieth century, as to painters
and photographers, skyscrapers resonated with tremendous, if profoundly
paradoxical, symbolic and emotional power.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 On the one hand, soaring into the heavens, taking up whole city blocks,
 housing many thousands of people, the skyscraper of a century ago was
 understood as an exhilarating harbinger of modernity's possibilities,
 "the footprint of the twentieth century," as <i>Munsey's</i> remarked
 in 1899.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The herculean scale of these new buildings was matched by their
 daunting complexity as technological, social, and economic systems,
 which required precise mastery of "thousands of intricate details"
 by planners and engineers.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Machine-age America's abiding fascination with visual intricacy and
 structural accessibility was expressed in the cunning stylings of such
 skyscrapers as the Woolworth Building, admired by the architectural
 critic Montgomery Schuyler for allowing people on the street pleasing
 access to the detailing of the uppermost floors in all its "distinctness
 and sharpness."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
But even as their synthesis of enormity, intricacy, and structural
accessibility could be read as the triumph of system-building, skyscrapers
also reminded observers that prevailing rationalist and individualist
models of cultural value were being drastically altered by the imperatives
of consolidating industrial capitalism. Skyscrapers promised to redefine
the parameters of American modernity along a sprawling scale in which
the individual, even the exceptional one, mattered less than the forces
of the corporate, the aggregate, the mass. Walter Pritchard Eaton
was only one early commentator who noted a tight parallel between the
growing enormity of buildings and the magnitude and impersonality of
the corporations behind many of them: "The phrase 'Big Business' has
leapt into the language, because the thing itself has shot up into the
economic structure, even as our skyscrapers have shot up on every street."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Arthur Goodrich called the drive to the skies an "inexorable force over
 which its makers have no control," while Eaton saw the skyscraper city's
 inhabitants as "midgets who have moulded mountains and who have then
 been moulded by them, played upon by the environment they have created"
 (<i>NY</i>, 6).
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 Many early descriptions used the staggering numbers of component
 parts in skyscrapers to create ritualized litanies of mass statistics:
 35 million bricks in the Metropolitan Life Tower, and 2462 miles of
 telegraph and

<b></b>

telephone wire; enough glass in the Woolworth Building's exterior windows
to create a giant awning extending over all of Madison Square; enough
horsepower in the Woolworth's giant boilers to lift a hundred Statues
of Liberty at one time, and so on.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 No matter how comically arbitrary these transformations of one
 type of mass into another might become, they asserted the relative
 insignificance of any individual element&#8212;even the owner of
 the building.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 For each larger-than-life ego like F. W. Woolworth, driven to construct,
 in the words of <i>Citizen Kane</i>'s sardonic newsreel, "the costliest
 monument a man has built to himself," there was a Metropolitan Life
 or Equitable Insurance Corporation, using sober actuarial paradigms
 to calculate the value of its skyscraper in rentable office space and
 public relations impact. And even Woolworth had made his fortune by
 selling millions of people hundreds of millions of cheap tiny things.

<p>
Not surprisingly given these tensions between individual and mass,
there was a persistent paradox threaded through the futuristic hoopla
surrounding early skyscrapers. On the one hand, as crowning achievements
of rational system-building, they seemed to convey their inhabitants
and observers toward global communication, toward efficient management
of resources, toward a modern future without boundaries. Yet these very
hyperrationalist significations carried an ambiguous charge: skyscrapers
took shape out of "an enormous puzzle of interwoven lines and numerals
and hieroglyphics worked out on many broad drawing-boards" ("BOAOB,"
2959). As this imagery of hermetic codes and signs suggests, these
buildings put new mysteries into play, and their vast scale confounded
adequate comprehension of their possible functions or meanings. This
ambiguity gave rise to a mythic-anthropological rhetoric that often
ironically linked the skyscraper to exotic environments of hermetic
insularity. The skyscraper city constituted a powerful challenge
to the Enlightenment-capitalist ideal of rationally planned cities
built in low-rise radial shapes, dominated by single-use properties,
assuming healthful but not inaccessible boundaries between work and
home environments. This older urban ideal seemed to be giving way
to an amazingly dense vertical model in which the clamoring chaos of
the streets was kept at bay by technologically advanced, communally
conred modular structures, theoretically of unlimited size, so fully
meeting their inhabitants' needs that leaving them might prove altogether
unnecessary. What future did it augur for human society that, as Ray
Stannard Baker put it in 1899, "a man might live in a modern skyscraper
year in and year out, luxuriously, too, with every want richly supplied,
and never pass beyond the revolving storm doors at the street entrance?"
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
 One answer to that question was provided by the guidebook and travel
 publisher Moses King, whose postcard "Future New York: The City of
 Skyscrapers" (1910s) offered a paradigmatic cityscape&#8212;staple
 of later science fiction films from <i>Metropolis</i> to <i>The Fifth
 Element</i>&#8212;consisting of buildings so tall and densely grouped
 that they appear to give no viable access to the ground at all. (<A
 NAME="1" href="10.1newcomb_res.html#1"> 1</a>)

<p>
In this view of skyscraper modernity, urbanites were imagined
as contemporary "Cliff Dwellers," a metaphor that drew upon the
turn-of-the-century fascination with the Anasazi peoples who had built
eyrie-like dwellings high on the mesas of New Mexico,

<b></b>

Colorado, Arizona, and Utah at some unknown time in the distant past
(later determined to be between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries). In
the late 1880s, anthropologists and mountaineers had begun to explore,
photograph, and write about these remarkable places, emphasizing the
architectural acumen, tactical ingenuity, and sheer nerve of those who
built and lived in them.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 In early accounts these spaces conveyed a strong sense of the
 uncanny, which was not due merely to their extreme spatial
 inaccessibility. Commentators were also fascinated by the Cliff
 Dwellers' unknown origins, and by their seemingly sudden and unmotivated
 disappearance from places that seemed tactically impregnable even by
 much later standards.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Adding further to the mystery surrounding them was the belief that the
 Cliff Dwellers' remains showed a puzzling mixture of physiognomies,
 and their artifacts a marked eclecticism of style and sophistication,
 both of which implied a greater degree of interchange with the outside
 world than their hermetic living spaces seemed to admit.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
In 1893, the Cliff Dwellers were brought vividly into the consciousness
of hundreds of thousands of machine-age urbanites through an exhibit
at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, featuring a massive composite
simulation of a cliff, painted to resemble rock, into which were cut
tiny apertures approximating their living spaces, along with relics and
"portions of the real houses" taken from a dig in Colorado.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 (<a name="2" href="10.1newcomb_res.html#2"> 2</a>) The
 use of the Cliff Dwellers to describe the new spaces being created in
 the skyscraper metropolis was already in the Chicago air even before
 this exhibit went on public view. Also in 1893, the Chicago novelist
 Henry Blake Fuller published his novel

<b></b>

<i>The Cliff Dwellers</i> , which cemented the metaphor's
applicability to modern urbanites. Fuller's novel is one of the
earliest attempts to integrate the skyscraper setting into the genre of
social-realist fiction. His most original stroke was a mock-ethnographic
introduction presenting the book's narrative as an analysis of the site
of a new culture that needed to be named and understood:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Between the former site of old Fort Dearborn and the present site of our
newest Board of Trade there lies a restricted yet tumultuous territory
through which, during the course of the last fifty years, the rushing
streams of commerce have worn many a deep and rugged chasm . . . . Each of
these ca&ntilde;ons is closed in by a long frontage of towering cliffs,
and these soaring walls of brick and limestone and granite rise higher
and higher with each succeeding year, according as the work of erosion at
their bases goes onward&#8212;the work of that seething flood of carts,
carriages, omnibuses, cabs, cars, messengers, shoppers, clerks, and
capitalists, which surges with increasing violence for every passing day.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Fuller's facetious archaeology of the Chicago Loop centers on the Clifton
Building, a fictional eighteen-story skyscraper housing "four thousand
souls," and featuring wonderful elevating devices that "ameliorate
the daily cliff-climbing for the frail of physique and the pressed for
time" (<i>TCD</i>, 4). His narrative captures vividly the skyscraper's
paradoxical combination of variety and insularity, spatial openness and
hermetic inaccessibility.

<b></b>

The Clifton's "tribe" is notably fluid and "heterogeneous," containing
all walks of life from bankers to janitors, all of whom seem to be
recent arrivals from elsewhere (<i>TCD</i>, 4-5, 12). Of course the
building enables state-of-the-art accessibility to distant places,
so that "the warriors" of commerce may "communicate their messages,
hostile or friendly, to chiefs more or less remote" (<i>TCD</i>, 5). Yet
in gathering its vast variety of functions and resources into a single
space, the Clifton aims above all "to be complete in itself," to make it
"unnecessary" for its inhabitants, their archaeologist, or his readers to
"go afield either far or frequently" (<i>TCD</i>, 5).
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
A great deal of writing on skyscrapers between 1890 and 1915 emphasized
this incongruous mixture of hypertechnologized urban space with the
unknowable, uncanny, and hermetic landscape of the western desert. A
writer in <i>Munsey's</i> in 1898 noted that many streets "are already
darkened by the huge cliffs of masonry that rise above them"; in
<i>Collier's</i> C. P. Cushing objected to the "cheerless ca&ntilde;onlike
streets" created by the skyscrapers.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 C. F. Carter, writing in <i>The Technical World</i>, a venue we might
 expect to embrace the skyscraper, remarked on the menace to health
 and life from "the crowded warrens of the cliff dwellers towering
 . . . three hundred feet into the air on either side of the narrow
 slits called streets."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 In 1911, Edgar Allen Forbes synthesized these images and anxieties into
 a powerful vision of the future skyscraper city as "a collection of
 towns and villages under separate roofs," each "complete unto itself,"
 its elevators like "street railways running perpendicularly." The
 surrounding streets will be "canyons of a depth varying from 200 to
 400 feet, through which the wind will sweep like gales," and "the sky
 will be practically blotted out" from this "city of electric lights
 on the brightest days," which is inhabited by businessmen who seldom
 glimpse the sky at all.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 These are but a few of dozens of similar references to cliff and
 canyon (usually spelled <i>ca&ntilde;on</i>), which became consensual
 metaphors for the urban spaces, at once rational and mysterious,
 that were being remade by the rise of skyscrapers. (<a name="3"
 href="10.1newcomb_res.html#3"> 3</a>) Mildred Stapley noted
 that the "ca&ntilde;on streets" of lower Manhattan were the consequence
 of intractably contradictory requirements: economic efficiency dictated
 that builders maximize rentable space right up to the property line,
 yet code forbade any part of a building to extend into air space that
 was not over part of its lot.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 The inevitable result was the "sheer vertical wall deviating neither
 outward nor inward."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 Eaton best captured the paradoxical character of this imagery with this
 1915 remark: "Through the ca&ntilde;ons he has made, Man hustles and
 bustles, creating more perplexities than he can solve" (<i>NY</i>, 4).

<p>
The practical strictures of skyscraper-building may have perplexed and
darkened the streets of lower Manhattan, but they also helped beget new
aesthetic styles and notions of beauty. Eaton's 1915 account of his
evolving attachment to the skyscraper city reveals an important link
between its sheer lines, massive forms, and constantly changing state,
and an emerging aesthetic of modernism. At first perceiving the city as
"miles and miles of ugly dwellings, cave dwellings where people lived in
layers" (<i>NY</i>, 5), Eaton comes to love the "mortared Himalayas" of
Manhattan's streets, and credits skyscrapers and the spaces they create
("great crags in the walls of a man-made ca&ntilde;on") for providing
him with an aesthetic of beauty appropriate to the twentieth century,

<b></b>

modernist in all but name, that repudiates "symmetry" and "conformity"
(<i>NY</i>, 10), and instead embraces ceaseless variety (<i>NY</i>, 6),
"stirring challenge" (<i>NY</i>, 9), "endless surprises" (<i>NY</i>,
7), "sudden revelation. . . amid apparent ugliness" (<i>NY</i>, 9), and
anything that "rouses the eye to keener attention" (<i>NY</i>, 10). These
are the very qualities that drew the eyes, brushes, and cameras of
modernist visual artists to skyscrapers and cityscapes. Indeed, the
artist Robert MacCameron concluded in 1913 that the modern city's new
lines and forms augured a twentieth-century aesthetic that would emerge
across many genres, as the skyscraper's "freshening of the vision"
was sure to catalyze "fresh problems and solutions in other forms of art."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
American poets of the 1910s and early 1920s would perceive that
same allure, and explore those new notions of beauty, as they used
cityscape verse to work toward a vigorous modernist aesthetic capable of
negotiating, even embracing, the paradoxical conditions of modernity. In
their poems, skyscrapers carry a wide range of emotional meanings,
and function within a range of political discourses from capitalist
intimidation to revolutionary praxis. In short, they exhibit the depth,
variety, and complexity that the most resonant symbols of a cultural
moment possess. Some verses read the skyscraper city as an image
of bleakly depersonalized modernity, others as a locus of utopian
possibility. Most bear the traces of both these responses at once,
experiencing the skyscraper city as contradiction, instability, and
challenge. Perceiving the metropolitan grid as an arresting abstract
pattern of lights and lines that rivals the creations

<b></b>

of nature, they ponder how to balance this detached aesthetic perspective
with empathetic connection with others. As they feel the skyscraper
city hurtling them into a future of unimaginable marvels, they question
whether the constantly mutating metropolis would allow any meaningful
relationship with the past. As skyscrapers inspire them to new metaphors
for conceptualizing mass society, they worry that a society defined by
its masses might prove wholly inaccessible to the powers of poetry. As
they perceive the skyscraper's transformative power, promising access
to new levels of experience and understanding, they wonder whether it
will take them places human beings would want to go.

1 Challenging the Skies
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The young American poets who began to write about the modern metropolis
in the early 1910s had grown up while skyscrapers were rising in the
nation's cities. Since 1905 they had witnessed a breathtaking increase in
the height of the tallest structures, the culmination of thirty years of
skyscraper development. In the last decades of the century, the economic
imperative for taller buildings, which one early commentator called "the
capitalization of the air," had become enormous in the densest and most
desirable commercial areas such as lower Manhattan and the Chicago Loop,
as rents had become "prohibitive," and the purchase of land "impossible."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 For many years, the tallest structure in Manhattan had been the spire
 of Trinity Church on lower Broadway at 284 feet, asserting, as Thomas
 van Leeuwen notes, the longstanding "material claim of the church
 on the territory between Earth and Heaven"; but by 1880 Trinity had
 begun to function as a "mere yardstick for any new skyscraper that
 was thought fit to carry the name."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Through the 1880s, steel-frame technology, which theoretically
 eliminated height restrictions upon architects' imaginations, were
 rendered practical possibilities by the continuing refinement of
 the high-speed electric elevator, and the falling cost and better
 quality control of steel. The success of the nine-story Home Life
 Insurance Company in Chicago (William LeBaron Jenney, 1884), the
 ten-story Wainwright Building in St. Louis (Louis Sullivan, 1890-91),
 and other experiments indicated that the steel-clad tower could look
 good, inspire public wonderment, and make its owners money. Even
 so, various factors, including residual skepticism that buildings
 several hundred feet high could be physically stable, retarded great
 increases in height for some years after the principles of steel-frame
 construction were established. By 1900 the world's tallest building was
 the Park Row Building in lower Manhattan (R. H. Robertson, 1899), which
 rose 383 feet (thirty stories). The most distinctive modern structure
 in the artistic and cultural landscape of New York City before 1905,
 the Fuller Building, better known as the Flatiron (D. H. Burnham Co.,
 1902), was, at twenty-one stories, still under 300 feet high.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 Still, the drive to the skies had begun in earnest, and the visual
 scale of Manhattan life was being altered from street level to hundreds
 of feet in the air. In 1890, only six buildings in New York City rose
 as high as ten stories: by 1908 there were 538 such buildings, and by
 the end of 1912 this number had doubled again, to 1048.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
In the decade after 1905, the emergence of the twentieth-century
skyscraper would culminate in three lower Manhattan behemoths, each
in succession the tallest building in the world, which became magnetic
icons of the city for modernist writers, painters, and photographers:
the Singer Tower (612 feet, Ernest Flagg; completed 1908, demolished
1967), the Metropolitan Life Tower (700 feet, Napoleon LeBrun &amp; Sons,
1909), and the Woolworth Building (792 feet, Cass Gilbert, 1913). The
heaven-storming years that produced these three skyscrapers can hardly
be overestimated as a defining moment of urban modernity. Because of
the more height-restrictive zoning laws of the mid-1910s, and the more
conservative business climate produced by the Great War, these towers
stood as the three tallest in the world until after 1920, and the 700-foot
barrier was not eclipsed again until 1930.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>

<p>
Virtually everyone who approached Manhattan from the south or west
during the last thirty-five years of the twentieth century remembers,
now painfully, seeing the bland yet unmistakable twin towers of the
World Trade Center as the first visible signs of the city. Before 1930,
the very tallest buildings were even more prominent signifiers of the
metropolis. The Singer, Metropolitan, and Woolworth towers dwarfed
almost every other building in the city by hundreds of feet, and were
not obscured by a forest of surrounding skyscrapers until the 1950s. They
could be seen from virtually every prospect in greater New York City.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 An early booklet for the observation deck on the 50th floor of the
 Metropolitan Tower claimed plausibly that from there one could see
 "the homes of over one-sixteenth of the entire population of the United
 States" (<i>MLIC</i>, 45-46). The reverse must also have been true:
 certainly millions of people would have seen the Metropolitan, Singer,
 and Woolworth buildings, virtually every day of their lives.

<p>
Commanding this level of visual prominence and novelty, the tallest
skyscrapers became a form of spectacular popular culture, providing
symbolic currency in an era in which points of common understanding were
generally perceived to be disappearing. For better or worse, they were
the modern urban analogues of the small-town churches and schoolhouses
around which most American lives had once revolved: instantly recognizable
structures whose distinctive architectural features carried vivid, complex
cultural meanings, as compass-needles, gathering places, repositories of
civic and national pride&#8212;as sites of virtually every type of social
interaction, from ruthlessly commercial to frivolously recreational.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 As such, they laid a forceful claim on anyone interested in representing
 the defining features of urban modernity: painters, photographers,
 commercial artists; manufacturers of postcards, souvenirs, toys,
 almost every imaginable genre of material culture; and poets.

<p>
The opening ceremonies of the 792-foot Woolworth Building in 1913 evoked
the skyscraper's complex significance in the cultural landscape of
twentieth-century modernity. On the evening of 24 April, hundreds of feet
off the ground, a distinguished group of 800 guests gathered including,
as well as the expected industrialists and bankers, a member of the
Wilson cabinet, various foreign diplomats, three lieutenant governors,
and nearly twenty percent of the U. S. Congress from 28 states.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 When everyone was seated, all the building's exterior and interior
 lights were extinguished, and

<b></b>

exactly at 7:30 PM, President Wilson at the White House pressed a
button, igniting all of its 80,000 lights, "enough to illuminate
the entire 40-mile waterfront of Manhattan," no doubt as stunning an
effect to the crowds watching for miles around as to the dignitaries
inside (<i>SQMP</i>, 89-90). This dramatic event conjoined a variety
of political, commercial, technological, and aesthetic meanings into a
thoroughly ambiguous spectacle. On the one hand, it demonstrated that a
single skyscraper's reach extended not only throughout the metropolitan
area but to the seat of national government. The fact that such a
building so confidently, competently <i>worked</i> evoked a modernity of
complex interconnected elements that promised to be manageable through the
unending advance of industrial technologies and organizational skills. On
the other hand, mystifying an enormously laborious effort of construction
and wiring into a single magical instant of illumination, it asked
observers to accommodate another possible modernity, this one so massive
in scale and hermetic in character as to defy individual comprehension.

<p>
Not surprisingly given the association of skyscrapers with such monumental
spectacle, one group of poetic responses represented them as looming
ominously over the more humanly-scaled structures of the city, monstrous
in their sheer height and bulk, symbols of modern capital at its most
unaccountable and self-congratulatory. In his prize-winning poem for
the 1912 anthology <i>The Lyric Year</i>, "Second Avenue," Orrick Johns
indicts the ever-expanding array of skyscrapers as a "jagged line of
mist-enshrouded masonry" that "you, my people, reared and built/ To be
a temple and a shrine/ For gods of iron and gilt."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 In "Lines to the Woolworth Building" , the anarchist poet and
 sculptor Adolf Wolff admits that the Woolworth, completed only that
 year, "awes my soul," but quickly goes on to condemn it as a "monstrous
 sacrilege" because never "has thing so big been made for end so small."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Wolff is playing here with the specific incongruity of a
 five-and-ten-cent store housing itself in the world's tallest
 building; his more general point, of course, is that the Woolworth as
 an achievement is vitiated because it commemorates only "the priests
 of lucre" ("LTTWB," 29).
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 Appropriate, therefore, that the building's "pallor" was "like in
 color to the tint of bones," its "slender, upright lines" "so much
 like children's bones" ("LTTWB," 29). Wolff ended with a fervent but
 conceptually banal condemnation of the building to the dust: like
 the pyramids, "tyrants' tombs, built by a million slaves," "ere long/
 Thou'lt be the relic of an age gone by" ("LTTWB," 29). Drawing from
 late genteel poetry's fusty reservoir of antiquarian imagery, such
 castigations of the idolatrous skyscraper espoused the conventional
 sentiments that poets had been expected to produce for decades. But
 they were not typical of American verse of the 1910s, which more often
 acknowledged both the intimidating potential of these great buildings,
 and also their allure as creations peculiarly expressive of modernity.

<p>
Many other poems, especially those in the radical orbit of <i>The
Masses</i> and <i>The Liberator</i>, tended to read the skyscraper as an
emblem of modernity defined by the limitless possibilities of communal
effort. The octave of John Reed's sonnet "Foundations of a Skyscraper"
(1910s) evokes the "ghastly" aspects of the construction process
("Thunder of drills, stiff spurting plumes of steam,-/ Shouts and the
dip of cranes, the

<b></b>

stench of earth"), but also treats this as a site of human possibility,
since out of an inferno of exploitative labor, "men give a vision birth,/
Crawling and dim, men build a dreamer's dream."
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The poem maintains a valuable balance between the utopian vision
 of "A phantom of fairtowers in the sky" and the grittier assertion
 that the true "foundation" of the skyscraper is human labor ("FOAS,"
 38). The sestet reinforces this convergence with a striking image of
 the building in the strenuous posture of the workman who built it:
 "Naked, a giant's back, tight-muscled, stark,/ Glimpse of mighty
 shoulder, etched in steel" ("FOAS," 38).

<p>
Reed's reference to "the clamor of unknown tongues" ("FOAS," 38) in the
skyscraper's construction site evokes the heterogeneous ethnic makeup
of its workforce, and the class-consciousness that such an enterprise
might promote, no doubt in spite of its developer's desires. Pursuing
this line of thought further, two poems published in <i>The Liberator</i>
celebrate great buildings as empowering icons of radical consciousness,
foreshadowing in verbal terms the representational strategies that Lewis
Hine would use a few years later to photograph the workers constructing
the Empire State Building in <i>Men at Work</i> . Like Hine's
photos, Raymond Corder's "The Skyscraper"  and Stirling Bowen's
"Skyscraper"  convert the modern capitalist tower into an emblem
of the utopian possibilities of collaborative human effort.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 Corder's poem begins, "All that steel frame-work bristling in the
 sun/ Is something we have done" ("TS," 21). The physical labor of
 construction ("We sweated, we plugged, and built it, span by span") has
 enabled the workers to think of themselves as the building's "creators,"
 and therefore, its rightful owners: "And every rusty beam that skyward
 towers/ Is ours&#8212;we built it&#8212;It is ours!" ("TS," 21). The
 poem's distinctive proletarian voice uses a high-spirited slang to
 acknowledge the obligations of doctrine ("Sure, buddy, sure, I know/
 The boss has got it now-he'll have to go" ["TS," 21]), but prefers to
 admire the building a bit longer as an object of beauty and a source
 of pride, a central constituent in a materialist-modernist aesthetic
 that valorizes collective human achievement above natural verities:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
But, say, boy, watch them clouds,
<br />
They seem to stand still while that eye-beam strouds
<br />
Across the sky.-She's pretty, ain't she, son?
<br />
That piece of work we've done. ("TS," 21)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As many of Hine's photos feature iconic human res who echo the shape
of buildings or extend the implied motion of machines, Bowen's sonnet
"Skyscraper" suggests how heavy machinery exponentially magnifies the
power of the ordinary worker: "One man mops his brow/ And, spitting,
scoops two tons of dirt up now/ In one iron fist.&#8212;plain Mike
or Tom or Pete" ("S," 13). Extending the individual human frame, with
"fist" and "great arms," the crane incarnates the growing strength of
the proletariat as a collective body ("S," 13). Bowen flatly refuses
to interpret the building's massive scale as a parable of hubris, and
instead appropriates the imagery of pagan idolatry for the "clear godless"
nature of this human enterprise: "No god can muddle anything we

<b></b>

try!" ("S," 13) The building is indeed "Babel's modern tower," since
it has drawn together a multiethnic workforce who "confuse the Yankee
tongue," but this is a source of affirmation as well, as the skyscraper
becomes the magnificent result of their growing class consciousness
("S," 13).

<p>
The skyscraper's contradictory ability to embody both the depersonalizing
mystifications of corporate capitalism, and the limitless possibilities
of collective labor, is acutely articulated by Arturo Giovannitti's "The
Day of War: Madison Square, June 20th," published in <i>The Masses</i>
for August 1916, in an oppressive atmosphere of patriotic rhetoric and
preparedness parades.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Giovannitti introduces in the first line a "hawk-faced youth with
 rapacious eyes, standing on a shaky chair" who exhorts an alienated
 and scattered crowd, "idle, yawning, many-hungered, beggarly," to
 embrace the cause of radical labor ("TDOW," 283). Studded with images of
 bellicosity, this young man embodies the hard line of <i>The Masses</i>'
 revolutionary persona, as "his red tie flows tempestuously in the wind,
 the unfurled banner of his heart amidst the musketry of his young
 words" ("TDOW," 283). But he also has a human communicativeness and
 vulnerability otherwise lacking from the clamorous physical textures of
 the urban street. Giovannitti places him at the heart of the capitalist
 skyscraper city, "in the roar of the crossways, under the tower that
 challenges the skies, terrible like a brandished sword" ("TDOW,"
 283). The humanity and sincerity of this warlike youth contrast to
 the other version of war that erupts upon the street, which is all
 the more intimidating for being disjointed and depersonalized: "the
 blast of a trumpet, its notes ramming like bullets against the white
 tower./ The soldiers march up the Avenue. The crowd breaks, scatters,
 and runs away, and only six listeners remain" ("TDOW," 283). Though we
 get nothing more than this fragmentary glimpse of the military parade,
 it breaks the spell of the boy's rhetoric, dissipates the "island
 of silence" his voice had created amidst the "roar" of the city, and
 sends most of his audience scurrying aimlessly away ("TDOW," 283). As
 the last listeners drift off one by one (even the poet's alter ego,
 whom he calls "the stranger I know"), until only a single young woman
 is left, Giovannitti acknowledges the difficulty of resistance to a
 capitalist modernity that enforces conformism by isolating people from
 one another ("TDOW," 283).

<p>
However, this story is not over: as Giovannitti repeats four times in
the second half of the poem, "But he speaks on" ("TDOW," 283). The boy's
persistence marks his cause as indomitable, as does the girl who remains
transfixed, "her upturned face glowing before the brazier of his soul,"
proving that his words need not inevitably fall on deaf ears, and can
produce tangible results in the world ("TDOW," 283). At the end he,
she, and the tower "are the only three things that stand straight
and rigid and inexpugnable/ Amidst the red omens of war" ("TDOW,"
283). Though Giovannitti never names this building, he certainly has
in mind the Metropolitan Life Tower, sited on the southeast corner
of Madison Square, at 700 feet the area's tallest building by far,
and containing on its white walls the largest clock in the world. (<A
NAME="4" href="10.1newcomb_res.html#4"> 4</a>) At the
beginning of the poem, the tower may seem just another depersonalized
and alienating element of the modern capitalist city. Yet even at that
point the building is associated with the speaking boy just beneath,
as he mimics its height by standing on a chair. When he exhorts

<b></b>

the crowd, "his shadow is heavy and hard upon their faces," as the tower's
must also be ("TDOW," 283). At the poem's end, only the girl remains,
one resolute listener to match the boy's indomitable speech, and the
tower's great clock strikes twelve: "one by one drop at his feet the
twelve tolls of the clock that marks time, the time that knows and flows
on until his day comes" ("TDOW," 283). By associating the timekeeping
tower with the young radicals, Giovannitti proposes a Marxian reading of
capitalist modernity as an era that has generated both greater levels
of inhumane exploitation, and also the class consciousness necessary
for radical change, whose time is inexorably approaching. For him and
other leftist poets of the era, the skyscraper tower signifies not
just alienating and inhumane modernity, but the human race's ability
to create things. Its great strength, its inexpugnability, even its
shape that rebels against supposedly eternal verities ("challenges the
skies")&#8212;all these qualities make the skyscraper central to an
iconography of revolutionary modernism.

2 Abyss, Eternity, Threshold
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In modernist poems the skyscraper tower often represents rocklike
strength, for obvious reasons; yet as a symbol it is remarkably tensile,
allowing Giovannitti to reshape a monument to corporate capitalism into
a harbinger of Marxist revolution. This malleability of symbolic function
is congruent with another of the skyscraper's paradoxical

<b></b>

signifying powers: the ability to transform temporal and spatial
principles previously perceived as immutable. A host of early modernist
writers explored great buildings as liminal spaces, thresholds to new
dimensions of consciousness or experience, windows into the future or the
past, or harbingers of radical, even apocalyptic change. Harriet Monroe,
the poet of her generation most deeply engaged with urban modernity,
noted that in many climatic circumstances skyscrapers extended past the
limits of visual perception to create a sublime vertigo that confused
terrestrial and celestial: "The many-windowed walls uprear so high/
They dim and quiver and float away in mist/ Tangling the earth and sky."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Walter Pritchard Eaton likewise perceived the skyscraper's vastness
 outstripping identifiable climatic zones, in effect transcending weather
 itself: "On foggy days the Singer Building and its sister peaks go up
 out of sight into the vapors. Again, on days of heavy atmosphere and
 lowering rain . . . I have seen the lower portions of the buildings
 obliterated, and only their summits reared on nothing into the gray
 air, a dream city, unbelievable, ethereal, immense" (<i>NY</i>,
 21-22). Images of crossing and transformation re frequently in
 commentaries upon these buildings that made people feel themselves
 "on the abyss of eternity."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 One of the most imaginative of these was by Ray Stannard Baker, who
 described the steel-frame skyscraper as "more a bridge than a building"
 ("TMS," 48). In Baker's vision of a horizontal structure somehow also
 becoming vertical, the supporting steel girders are "big bridges,"
 and elevators the vehicles conveying us into some unknown region in
 the heavens ("TMS," 56, 48). Eaton too imagined skyscrapers at night
 as vertical thoroughfares rising into the air, proposing that the
 "upward rows of lights" give lower Manhattan "exactly the aspect of
 a town of many streets running up a great dome-like hill, each little
 house by the roadside imagined from its square of light" (<i>NY</i>,
 22). The skyscraper's ability to blur fundamental spatial distinctions
 between vertical and horizontal, between earth and heavens, gave it
 an uncanny liminal force.

<p>
As it made people feel they were teetering on the very edges of space
and time, the liminal skyscraper catalyzed some poets into hallucinatory
visions of nightmare modernity. Armond Carroll's "From a City Street"
 offers a surreal portrait of "harpies of our modern time," who
perch on the "crags which high uplift/ Their steel-knit skeletons" above
"the surfs that surge and shift."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 The trope of people surging and ebbing among the enormous buildings
 like a restless "surf" can also be read as a punning reference to their
 serfdom to the forces of modernity tossing them about. Far above the
 street, these harpies both "mock the futile restless waves/ That surge
 in great affair below," and ironically "hail to wide oblivious graves/
 The victims of the undertow."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 The simultaneous mocking and hailing implies that a society gets
 the imaginative icons it deserves; these harpies, however murky and
 unsatisfying, are faithful emblems of the chaotic and depredatory
 culture that constructed the crags they inhabit. Their mocking is thus
 appropriate commemoration for that culture's victims. The apocalyptic
 resonance of the heaven-storming tower, implicit in Carroll's
 skyscraper-Gothic, comes to the fore in Horace Holley's "Skyscrapers"
 , which compares the skyline to "a forest of strange palms"
 apparently not subject to natural laws: they don't sway in wind,
 "nor nod sleepy at evening," nor offer to "nestling birds/ A warm

<b></b>

and comfortable mossy bough."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
 Unnerved at these contraventions of the natural order, the speaker
 hurls at the skyscrapers the apocalyptic prediction that nature must
 ultimately reassert its dominion through "a furious tempest" that
 will "tear your earth-devouring roots" and rain down "terrible fruit"
 of stone upon "a shore deserted."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
The American poem that most fully explores the skyscraper as such
a liminal space comes from a writer few would even associate with
urban modernity, Sara Teasdale, whose work has been unjustifiably
miniaturized by high modernism's interlocking preconceptions about gender
and genre. Teasdale's "From the Woolworth Tower," published in the 1915
volume <i>Rivers to the Sea</i> but eventually dropped from her collected
works, consists of seventy-four lines divided into short beginning and
ending sections framing a longer central meditation. The first section
describes a couple enjoying each other's company in the city of modern
amusements, arriving "vivid with love, eager for greater beauty," into
the "brilliant and warm" corridors of the Woolworth Building ("FTWT,"
12). The elevator's "sharp unswerving flight" up to the observation deck
transports them from the everyday world into a sublime realm of unseen
and uncanny forces ("FTWT," 12). As they "shoot" through "swirling and
angry" air that "howls like a hundred devils," the speaker is highly
"Conscious of the chasm under us" ("FTWT," 12). She has entered an
unstable liminal zone in which the division between air above and earth
below can no longer be taken for granted.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 The skyscraper's liminal force intensifies when they reach the top, pass
 through "a door leading onto the ledge&#8212;," and find themselves
 perched "over the edge of eternity," accompanied only by "wind,
 night and space!" ("FTWT," 12-13). Alarmed at the "terrible height,"
 the speaker still realizes with some wonder that they have actively
 chosen to experience it ("Why have we sought you?") ["FTWT," 13]. She
 speaks here not as a bohemian seeking esoteric urban thrills, but as
 an American participating fully in the popular culture of her times:
 until its closing in 1941 due to wartime precautions, the Woolworth's
 observation deck attracted 250,000 visitors annually (<i>SQMP</i>,
 136). (. <a href="10.1newcomb_res.html#5" name="5">5</a>, <a href="10.1newcomb_res.html#6" name="6">6</a>)

<p>
The poem's second section, describing the view from the tower, negotiates
most of the key themes of cityscape poetry: the perception of the city as
abstract patterns of lights and forms that rival or displace the creations
of nature; the desire to balance this detached perspective with empathy
for others; the anxiety that the scale and impersonality of skyscraper
modernity may overwhelm the poet's communicative powers; and the uneasy
attempt to situate the modern metropolis into a meaningful relationship
with past and future. Regaining her perceptual and emotional bearings,
the speaker perceives the abstract visual drama of the city's lights ("A
thousand times more numerous than the stars") outlining its dark shapes:
"Oh lines and loops of light in unwound chains/ That mark for miles
and miles/ The vast black mazy cobweb of the streets" ("FTWT," 13). As
in much cityscape verse, the modernist visual arts provide a point of
reference for the poetic imagination: "Near us clusters and splashes
of living gold/ That change far off to bluish steel" ("FTWT," 13). This
painterly abstraction evokes the poet's sense of being transported into a
liminal city in which the familiar "strident noises" of the street float
up to them, now "hallowed into whispers" ("FTWT," 13-14). The stridency
has been hallowed out of them, but questions remain. Does the poet's

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 113]</b>

liminal sensitivity make these "whispers" comprehensible as human
utterances? Or have they simply been distanced and aestheticized into
the spectacle of the nocturnal cityscape?

<p>
The anxiety created by these questions becomes primary in the next verse
paragraph, which turns toward the human element of the city conspicuously
absent so far. But the results of this turn are immediately discouraging:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We feel the millions of humanity beneath us,-
<br />
The warm millions, moving under the roofs,
<br />
Consumed by their own desires;
<br />
Preparing food,
<br />
Sobbing alone in a garret,
<br />
With burning eyes bending over a needle,
<br />
Aimlessly reading the evening paper. . . ("FTWT," 14)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Assailed by fleeting perceptions of "the sorrow, the torpor, the
bitterness, the frail joy" of human life that "come up to us" as the
whispers had done, but now feel "like a cold fog wrapping us round,"
the speaker can muster none of Whitman's belief in "Crossing Brooklyn
Ferry" that human connection might transcend the distance between the
present moment and other ages.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 She also feels unmoved by the tower as a symbol of future human
 progress, concluding that in a hundred years "the anguish, the
 torpor, the toil/ Will have passed to other millions/ Consumed by
 the same desires," and eventually "darkness will blot the lights/
 And the tower will be laid on the earth," with only sea and stars
 remaining "unchanging" and "unconcerned" ("FTWT," 15). For Teasdale,
 the illuminating liminality the tower brings turns out to be bitterly
 ironic. As a vehicle for abstracting oneself from the moment-to-moment
 perceptual plenitude of street life for a more meditative perspective,
 as a threshold to deeper understanding, it has yielded the appalling
 conclusion that modernity is merely the clockwork acting-out of petty
 melodrama, followed by implacable apocalypse.

<p>
Instead of, say, a sober descent from the building to contrast the
exhilarating ascent, the brief final section retreats from these
anguished realizations, and announces that despite the "sorrow, futility,
defeat" all around, love "has crowned us/ For a moment/ Victors" ("FTWT,"
15). Here Teasdale attempts to complete the theme of liminality, implying
that because the building has allowed the lovers to abstract themselves
from the strident and chaotic textures of the city, to exist "on the
abyss of eternity," they have understood the power and the value of their
love more deeply than they could have done below ("FTWT," 15). But this
wishful affirmation pales next to the disillusioning force of her earlier
realizations, and whatever fleeting victory she feels is bittersweet at
best. Teasdale's eventual rejection of "From the Woolworth Tower" is
understandable given its problematic ending, but is also unfortunate,
because the poem is her most ambitious attempt to integrate the idiom
of the rhapsodic love lyric with urban modernity, a project deserving of
serious reconsideration by current historicist criticism. The alienated
futility she describes here is indeed one aspect of the modernist response
to modernity, though not the primary, much less the only one, as

<b></b>

ideologies of high modernism often assert. The poem remains illuminating
as an emotionally raw and ambivalent instance of literary modernism's
horror at depersonalized modern mass society, before this was styled
into seductive elegance by Eliot and the Fugitives, and then elevated
to high-culture dogma after World War II.

<p>
Teasdale's vision of tall buildings collapsing upon the shore in the
face of an apocalyptic storm evokes the "falling towers" of <i>The
Waste Land</i> , which are seldom considered in relation to the
modern skyscraper.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 In the beginning of "What the Thunder Said," when Eliot describes
 "mountains of rock without water" amongst which "one cannot stop or
 think," he refers most directly to the quasi-biblical desert landscape
 that has framed the entire poem and lent it a title (<i>TWL</i>, 334,
 336). But a few dozen lines later, we approach an arid "city over the
 mountains" that "cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air,"
 which leads directly to a litany of human history as a succession of
 "falling towers/ Jerusalem Athens Alexandria/ Vienna London/ Unreal"
 (<i>TWL</i>, 372-77). This associative sequence links the waste land's
 sterile mountains of rock to the "unreal" cities of modernity, a linkage
 reinforced by the adjective "violet," which Eliot had previously used
 to evoke the machine-age city at dusk ("the violet hour, when the
 eyes and back/ Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits/
 Like a taxi throbbing waiting" [<i>TWL</i>, 215-17]). Indeed, despite
 its studied timelessness that draws upon biblical parables and ancient
 vegetation rituals, the desert landscape has possessed attributes of
 the modern city all along. Most notably, existence in the waste land
 is typified, as in the city, not by true solitude ("There is not even
 solitude in the mountains"), but by an alienation from others that
 is exacerbated by there being so many of them, so many "red sullen
 faces" sneering and snarling "from doors of mudcracked houses" that
 "one can neither stand nor lie nor sit" (<i>TWL</i>, 343, 344-45,
 340). These "hooded hordes swarming/ Over endless plains, stumbling
 in cracked earth" (<i>TWL</i>, 369-70) can be seen as analogues of the
 contemporary crowd surging over London Bridge, eyes fixed before feet,
 to arrive at offices "on the final stroke of nine" (<i>TWL</i>, 68).

<p>
The last lines of <i>The Waste Land</i> memorably synthesize urban and
desert settings, as the speaker sits "upon the shore/ Fishing, with
the arid plain behind" him, his great buildings crumbling, his finely
styled phrases disintegrating into fragmented collage (which begins
"London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down") (<i>TWL</i>,
424-25, 427). Eliot prophesies a cataclysmic, if entropic, denouement
to the accelerating human expansion into the sky. The approaching
storm at the poem's end can be interpreted equally as the harbinger
of some cleansing spiritual rejuvenation, or as the cosmic <i>coup de
grace</i> upon a self-annihilating culture. Eliot's ambivalence toward
modernity, his obvious fascination with the industrial city even as he
is repulsed by it, is perhaps the most precious element of his mixed
legacy to modernism, but this largely vanishes from his work after
his conversion to Christianity. Still gripped by it in <i>The Waste
Land</i>, he articulates as forcefully as anyone the wonder and anguish
of experiencing everything that is solid, even and especially our most
massive bulwarks against instability, cracking, reforming, and bursting
in the viole(n)t air of modernity.

3 The Light That Never Fails
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The building in the Manhattan skyline most significant to American
poets before 1930 was the 700-foot Metropolitan Life Tower, located
at 1 Madison Avenue on the southeast corner of Madison Square (just
across from the Flatiron, the structure that meant the most to visual
artists). The Metropolitan Tower, an instantly recognizable structure
with several unique visual features, was integral to several poems of
the 1910s and 1920s that consider the role of poetry in modern urban
experience. The white tower that dominates Giovannitti's cityscape of
revolutionary modernity, "The Day of War: Madison Square, June 20th,"
is the Metropolitan in all but name. It also initiates the mystical
singing of William Rose Ben&eacute;t's "The Singing Skyscrapers." In the
opening lines of her exquisite lyric "Parting Gift" , Elinor Wylie,
gently teasing her partner Ben&eacute;t for his fascination with these
great structures, uses the Metropolitan as a shorthand reference for
worldly grandeur, presuming it to be a characteristic object of desire
for the modern urban subject:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I cannot give you the Metropolitan Tower.
<br />
I cannot give you heaven;
<br />
Nor the nine Visigoth crowns in the Cluny Museum;
<br />
Nor happiness, even.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Several of these poems contain glancing references to the Metropolitan's
appearance and lighting effects that may strike current readers as
murky or private. But this is our lack, not the poems', since the
tower's nocturnal spectacle, visible from virtually everywhere in the
city, must have been known to almost every Manhattanite of the early
twentieth century. Indeed, this imagery is obscure to us precisely
<i>because</i> it was so familiar to the era's poets and readers, who
needed no contextual introduction. At any rate, these poems use the
lights and other attributes of the Metropolitan Tower to articulate
a wide range of emotional states: love, disappointment, yearning for
stability, alienation, skepticism, commitment to social change. This
range of possible significations invites us to see the building as an
exemplary symbol in a poetic modernism deeply engaged with modernity.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
The first poet to explore the resonance of this exemplary great building
was again Sara Teasdale, whose lyric "The Metropolitan Tower" begins an
unofficial sequence of six poems that conclude the "Love Songs" section
of <i>Helen of Troy and Other Poems</i> .
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 All six feature titles of geographically specific settings in greater
 New York City (Gramercy Park, the Metropolitan Museum, Coney Island,
 Union Square, and Central Park); collectively they trace the unhappy
 progress of a modern love relationship. "The Metropolitan Tower"
 initiates the sequence by recounting "Love's birth" in the speaker's
 heart during an hour spent walking with a companion at dusk around
 the then brand-new skyscraper ("TMT," 29). The first two of its three
 stanzas use the tower's visual sequences and timekeeping function to
 measure the speaker's emotionally heightened time:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
We walked together in the dusk
<br />
To watch the tower grow dimly white,
<br />
And saw it lift against the sky
<br />Its flower of amber light.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
You talked of half a hundred things,
<br />
I kept each hurried word you said,
<br />
And when at last the hour was full,
<br />I saw the light turn red. ("TMT," 29)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The speaker's evolving commitment to her companion is precisely
articulated through the tower's sequence of lighting effects.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 (<a name="7" href="10.1newcomb_res.html#7"> 7</a>)
 The first phase of her experience corresponds to the "amber light"
 that flowers on the building's clock as dusk approaches, which here
 suggests the sense of infinite emotional possibility one perceives
 upon first feeling love ("TMT, 29). These feelings swell as the
 building's illumination brightens minute by minute, to be culminated
 by the flashes of the lantern as the "hour" reaches its end, an event
 the speaker anticipates as eagerly ("at last") and feels as intensely
 as she might the "full" consummation of her love ("TMT," 29).

<p>
But all the while, her oblivious paramour flits from one trivial
observation to another, leading us to suspect that he must eventually
disappoint her. The final stanza of "The Metropolitan Tower" foreshadows
the sequence's bleak ending, wistfully reaffirming her love despite his
unresponsive self-absorption:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
You did not know the time had come,
<br />
You did not see the sudden flower,
<br />
Nor know that in my heart Love's birth
<br />
Was reckoned from that hour. ("TMT," 29)
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The syntactic and rhythmic parallels of the phrases "the light turn red"
and "the time had come" create a strong sense of rhetorical momentum and
culmination, pulling us forward much as the speaker is being pulled into
deep emotional attachment, even as we note that red lights conventionally
signify impending danger ("TMT," 29). And yet, in the midst of all this
modern inconstancy, the tower signifies not impersonality or alienation:
indeed, it is the only constant in the unstable emotional milieu the
speaker has entered, and only through its steadfast presence and knowable
visual sequences can she chart her own emotional <i>dur&eacute;e</i>.

<p>
To the corporate owners of the Metropolitan Tower, this constancy was
central to its meaning and value. In 1943 the company's historian proudly
described the tower's clock, chimes, and lighting beacon, which "flashed
for miles over New York City and the neighboring towns." This beacon
advertised the dependability of Metropolitan Life, and became the basis of
one of the company's self-defining slogans, "The Light That Never Fails."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 Another early modernist poem, Lola Ridge's "Time-Stone," examines the
 Metropolitan Tower as a modern measuring device, literally marking the
 passage of time, but also serving as a symbolic locus of enumeration
 and evaluation.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 Ridge is as fascinated with the tower as Teasdale, but is certainly
 more skeptical of its <b></b> beneficence



than its corporate biographer. She develops an extraordinarily compressed
and resonant critique of the tower's entanglement in ideologies of
patriarchal capitalism. Here is the poem in full:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
HALLO, Metropolitan&#8212;
<br />
Ubiquitous windows staring all ways,
<br />
Red eye notching the darkness.
<br />
No use to ogle that slip of a moon.
<br />
This midnight the moon,
<br />
Playing virgin after all her encounters,
<br />
Will break another date with you.
<br />
You fuss an awful lot,
<br />
You flight of ledger books,
<br />
Overrun with multiple ant-black res
<br />
Dancing on spindle legs
<br />
An interminable can-can.

<b></b>

<br />
But I'd rather . . . like the cats in the alley . . . count time
<br />
By the silver whistle of a moonbeam
<br />
Falling between my stoop-shouldered walls,
<br />
Than all your tally of the sunsets,
<br />
Metropolitan, ticking among stars. ("TSS," 51)

<p>
The title portrays the tower as a device of temporal measurement, a
sort of gigantic sundial, monumental and timeless in its association
with ancient products of human ingenuity. This particular time-stone,
however, also possesses a specifically modern character, signified first
of all by its panoptical capabilities ("Ubiquitous windows staring all
ways"), and by its function as enormous searchlight and beacon ("Red
eye notching the darkness"). The metaphor of notching&#8212;marking a
surface with a cut, for the purpose of measuring, counting, or keeping a
record&#8212;has both temporal and spatial functions in the poem. The red
flashes of the tower's lights notch the night temporally, into a finite
number of fifteen-minute segments; and spatially, darting outward to
illuminate and arrange the otherwise incoherent space of "the darkness"
into finite and discrete units. The illumination and arrangement of the
night is no mean feat, signifying here, as would the "emblazoned zones
and fiery poles" of Wallace Stevens' "The Idea of Order at Key West,"
the human power to create, reshape, and organize.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>

<p>
But Ridge has already begun to scrutinize the value of the tower's
rationalizing capacity through her use of "staring," which implies looking
without comprehension, judgment, or emotion. The building's authority
is challenged further through the "slip of a moon" that "at midnight,"
the moment of the tower's greatest aggrandizement, when even the hands
of its clock point straight upward, will "break another date" ("TSS,"
51). Even as the tower "breaks" (as in making publicly known) another
date in the passage of human time by recording the advent of midnight,
it is confounded by this timekeeper of a premodern era, which it can
only "ogle" fruitlessly. Ridge here begins a mischievous pursuit of the
phallic implications of the tall thin tower&#8212;ever erect yet never
satisfactorily coupled&#8212;revealing the anxieties of the patriarchal
imagination and the powermongering that emerges from them.

<p>
As if overcompensating for its inability to get satisfaction from
the moon, the tower embraces and proclaims its own <i>business</i>,
in two senses of the word. The skyscraper is all about doing business,
of course; but the "fuss" and clutter Ridge associates with it undermine
its ostensible rationalist precision. The ever-multiplying "ant-black
res" also do double duty, as both the dark-suited professionals
working in the building, rendered nearly microscopic by its enormity;
and as the numbers in the ledger books that record the business these
workers do. Calling the building a "flight of ledger books" ingeniously
mirrors its arrayed material components&#8212;such as flights of stairs,
banks of elevators, rows of desks and files&#8212;with the columns
of res, human and financial, that inhabit it. (<a name="8"
HREF="10.1newcomb_res.html#8"> 8</a>) That these flights
are "overrun" by the ant-black res again emphasizes the hectic
and uncontrolled&#8212;ultimately irrational&#8212;character of the
building's business, a critique given further force by Ridge's imagery of
dancing. The tower's "can-can" insistently asserts the can-do rationalism
that creates such buildings, but this frenetic dance ultimately succeeds
mostly in revealing the inadequacies

<b></b>

of that ideology. The ant-black human res are set dancing by their
compulsive need to conduct business, to make the res in their ledgers
leap, expand, and multiply. But the interminability of the dance implies
that it becomes its own end, with no goal or reward outside itself. The
fact that the res, both human and numerical, are "dancing on spindle
legs," offers little assurance of their ability to sustain their hectic
routine. The spindle is yet another intriguing image in this rich
passage. "Spindle legs" evoke the malnourishment, certainly spiritual
but possibly physical as well, of the tower's human population. Equated
with the numeric res in their ledgers, the humans are metaphorically
reduced to stick-res, their limbs but spindly pen-strokes.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

<p>
A spindle is also a literal piece of office equipment, a spike resting
on a desk on which stacks of papers are impaled. This is a suggestive
shape indeed in a poem about a very tall, very thin tower with a pointed
top. But while the tower may remind us of a huge spindle, the main
impact of this signification is to complete the ironic inversion of
its phallic power, since the function of a spindle would be to impale
forcibly the paper res kept within the tower, and by extension,
its human res as well. These images convey us to a vision, at once
sinister and whimsical, of the spindle-tower, striving obsessively upward
but failing to achieve any cosmic intercourse with the moon, succeeding
instead only in skewering its human creators, who may imagine themselves
as partaking in its power to penetrate, but who actually are penetrated
by it. Already reduced to the stature of insects in their "ant-black,"
these movers and shakers become the moved and shaken, subtler versions
of Eliot's image in "Prufrock" of modern-subject-as-insect, "pinned and
wriggling on the wall."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
The office spindle is a tool, rather an elemental one, for assembling,
organizing, and recording information; thus the image can also be
linked to the poem's controlling metaphor of the tower as a measuring
and recording device. It is to this conceit that Ridge turns again in the
final five lines, unfavorably evaluating the tower in contrast to the more
appealing if less exact method of counting time by the moonbeams that
filter between the walls of her building. Embracing the nonpatriarchal
and marginal values represented by the moon, the alley cats, and the
horizontal curves of her "stoop-shouldered walls," the poet playfully
presents the tower as grotesque in its enormity, rigid in its stability,
obsessive in its precision, ridiculous as it ticks mechanically away among
its celestial neighbors: ultimately, the emblem of a narrow capitalist
patriarchy whose only response to sunsets is to "tally" them ("TSS,"
51). The tally, like the notch and the spindle, is a rich term here,
again implying both spatial shape and temporal activity. A tally is a
stick on which notches are made to keep a record or count of something,
particularly a debt or payment. The tower, therefore, not only keeps
a tally but is itself a tally, attempting to notch the night and the
sunset, but instead mainly recording the interminable, empty business
of its own ledgers.

<p>
In exploring the confluence among assertions of patriarchal power,
anxieties of male sexual potency, and ideologies of capitalist aspiration,
Ridge has thoroughly ironized the skyscraper's symbolic function. Yet
the exuberance and wit of this critique suggests that in spite of her
critical gaze, she appreciates the tower for challenging and energizing
her creative powers. "Time-Stone" epitomizes a modernist poetics that
eschews a world elsewhere to participate wholeheartedly in the world of
urban-industrial modernity. More broadly, the fact that poets as divergent
in style and politics as Giovannitti, Teasdale, the Ben&eacute;ts, Wylie,
and Ridge were all drawn to write about the Metropolitan Tower testifies
to the depth and complexity of the skyscraper's imaginative power,
its capacity to signify the varied elements of modern experience. More
broadly still, these skyscraper poems demonstrate something too often
overlooked: the American modernist poet's rich and complex engagement
with the defining symbolic forms of twentieth-century modernity. Many of
the texts I mention here, such as Teasdale's "From the Woolworth Tower"
and William Rose Ben&eacute;t's "The Singing Skyscrapers," belong to an
important category of poems often dismissed as conventional because they
lack the referential opacity and emotional reserve that high-modernist
canons demanded. These poems combine a fascination with urban modernity,
and a willingness to explore innovative modes of verbal representation,
with the rhapsodic tonalities of nineteenth-century Romanticism. On the
other hand, of the neglected poems I discuss, the most conventionally
modernist in style, Ridge's "Time-Stone," seems as witty, opaque, ironic
as any New Critic might wish. Yet because it emerged out of a forceful
leftist engagement with modernity, it could not be accommodated within
the interpretive and ideological paradigms of New Criticism. I propose
that poetic modernism is, or should be, sufficiently capacious to take
all these poems as seriously as the works of Pound, Eliot, Stevens,
or Moore. From seventy years of formalist criticism we have inherited
impressive interpretive tools for modernist poetry. Now, in a postmodern
academic climate that relishes contradiction and eclecticism, suspects

<b></b>

moroseness, resists master-narratives, and yet demands some degree of
sociohistorical engagement, we need to adapt these tools to recovering
the many ways American poets articulated the complex, often contradictory
experiences that made modernity what it was, and is.

In the past few years, the field of modernist studies has been revivified
by scholarship that combines formalist and historicist techniques to
resituate modernist texts into the conditions of cultural modernity. Miles
Orvell's <i>The Real Thing: Imitation and Authenticity in American
Culture, 1880-1940</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press,
1989), Martha Banta's <i>Taylored Lives: Narrative Productions in the Age
of Taylor, Veblen, and Ford</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1993), Bill Brown's <i>The Material Unconscious: American Amusement,
Stephen Crane, and the Economies of Play</i> (Cambridge: Harvard
University Press, 1997), and Michael Brooks's <i>Subway City: Riding the
Trains, Reading New York</i> (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press,
1997) are but a few of the excellent contributions to this campaign. But
so far only a few pioneering studies have begun to apply historicist
methods to modern American poetry, and to show that verse texts, both
canonical and unknown, can offer powerful new insights when we put
the modernism back into modernity, and vice versa. See Cary Nelson's
<i>Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of
Cultural Memory, 1910-1945</i> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press,
1989) and <i>Revolutionary Memory: Recovering the Poetry of the American
Left</i> (New York: Routledge, 2001), Alan Golding's <i>From Outlaw to
Classic: Canons in American Poetry</i> (Madison: University of Wisconsin
Press, 1995), Michael Davidson's <i>Ghostlier Demarcations: Modern Poetry

American Poetry in the Great War</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1997), Michael Thurston's <i>Making Something Happen: American
Political Poetry Between the Wars</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North
Carolina Press, 2001), and Joseph Harrington's <i>Poetry and the Public:

Baker, "TMS," 58. The skyscraper's distinctive combination of endless
variety and hermetic self-containment was also captured in this 1903
comment: "From the time these men enter their offices in the morning until
they go at night, many of them need not leave the building. Messenger
boys rush in and out with messages. By telegraph, cable, and telephone,
they can talk with London, San Francisco, or Fiftieth Street, as
they wish. Supplies are there, the restaurant is there, their barber,
their newspaper, their bank, their insurance company, their own police
and detective service, their own fire department, their broker, their
lawyer. It is a complete community in itself" (Goodrich, "BOAOB," 2968).

Though some discussion of the ruins of the Anasazi Cliff Dwellers
had appeared in obscure publications in the mid-1870s, it was
not until 1888 that the largest settlements were discovered by the
archaeological community (see Watson Smith, "Introduction," in Gustav
N&ouml;rdensk&iuml;old, <i>The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde</i>,
transl. D. Lloyd Morgan (New York: AMS Press, 1893; 1973), xi. The first
widely-circulated print accounts came just as the building of steel-frame
skyscrapers accelerated. As well as Nordenski&ouml;ld's ethnographic
study, see Frederick Chapin's book <i>The Land of the Cliff Dwellers</i>
(Boston: Appalachian Mountain Club / W. B. Clarke, 1892).

<p>
<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
Some accounts of the Cliff Dwellers used ethnocentric or openly racist
premises to account for their technological aptitude, refusing to
believe they could be the ancestors of the agrarian Pueblo peoples who
lived in the plains below, insisting that they must instead have been a
"lost fragment of Egyptian civilization," or even a "white people" of
"a prehistoric age" (see Joseph Munk, <i>Arizona Sketches</i> [New York:
Grafton Press, 1905], 171).

This model of the skyscraper as an insular microcosm combining futuristic
and ancient elements descends from the Cliff Dwellers metaphor down into
postmodern science-fiction, most vividly in Ridley Scott's dystopian

monolithic Tyrell Corporation and the protagonist's fortresslike
apartment block feature design motifs reminiscent of Egyptian or
Amerindian cultures.

Stapley, "The City of Towers," 706. The sheer vertical wall, extending
to the property line and rising straight up, was the architectural
principle that made lower Manhattan's ca&ntilde;on streets so dark and
cheerless. Almost two decades of debate culminated in furor over the
notoriously monolithic Equitable Building, which was originally conceived
to rise 909 feet straight up. When completed in 1915 it had been reduced
to 542 feet, but still occupied virtually its entire one-acre lot all
the way to the top, "casting a noonday shadow four blocks long and
six times its own size" (see Sarah Bradford Landau and Carl Condit,
<i>The Rise of the New York Skyscraper 1865-1913</i> [New Haven: Yale
University Press], 394; henceforth abbreviated to <i>RNYS</i>). In 1916,
New York enacted zoning restrictions that restricted such sheer vertical
walls in tall buildings and mandated setback designs. Though the setback
debate was often framed in aesthetic, moral, and even medical terms,
the driving force behind

<b></b>

these restrictions was economic, as by 1910 it was clear that buildings
like the Equitable could have catastrophic effects on the value of
properties in their perpetual shadows, since few wanted to rent space
that offered no direct sunlight and little fresh air.

economic incentives, they do not fully explain the race into the skies,
which bespoke a deep psychic need for physical signs of the United
States' supremacy as a modernized nation. In pursuing this argument,
Ann Douglas ingeniously situates the skyscraper's "commodification of
the air as a marketable product" within the larger modernist category
of "airmindedness," which includes plane flight and broadcasting (see

The building's interior designer (no doubt unintentionally) invited
this sort of response from the skeptical with a grotesque corbel in
the southeast corner of the lobby that depicted the highest priest of
low lucre, F. W. Woolworth himself, counting nickels and dimes. Wolff's
condemnation of this monument to filthy lucre was particularly ironic
given that, almost uniquely among early skyscrapers, the Woolworth was
built and paid for in cash with no mortgage. Thomas van Leeuwen remarks
of this, "The building was conceived . . . as a memorial to the means by
which its owner had assembled his fortune, namely nickels and dimes, the
'atomic elements' of capitalism. But it also represented Woolworth's
preparations for the hereafter: the money was being returned to the
public in the form of a building that was without the sin of usury"
(van Leeuwen, <i>The Skyward Trend of Thought</i>, 67-68). Clearly,
Wolff was not impressed with this stratagem.

Horace Holley, "Skyscraper," in <i>Creation: Post-Impressionist Poems</i>
(London: A. C. Fifield, 1914), 22. As we know, skyscrapers often sway
in wind, but their relative stability was one of the features of the
new buildings that most astonished people in the 1900s and 1910s. It
was claimed that the Woolworth Building was capable of withstanding
hypothetical winds of 200 M.P.H. without structural damage (see
<i>COC</i>, 27); in January 1913, three months before its dedication,
it did withstand gusts of 90 miles an hour with no damage (see Landau
and Condit, <i>RNYS</i>, 359). Of course, Holley is wrong too about the
skyscraper's inability to house birds.

<p>
<a name="FOOT44" href="#REF44">44</a>.
Holley, "Skyscraper," 22. William Rose Ben&eacute;t's "The Singing
Skyscrapers"  also offers a hallucinatory response to the
contemporary skyscraper, though Ben&eacute;t's apocalypse results in
a vision of celestial splendor. Half-awake, half-dreaming, the speaker
invokes by name the city's "tall titanic towers"&#8212; Metropolitan,
Flatiron, Singer, Woolworth&#8212;and imagines them "Singing in the air"
(see William Rose Ben&eacute;t, "The Singing Skyscraper," in <i>The
Burglar of the Zodiac</i>, [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1918],
1). These state-of-the-art modern buildings sing of vanished cities of the
past, which live on "Spectrally" in the human collective unconscious (as
"Majestic phantom cities that move above our slumber/Hung aloft in air"
[2]), and manifest themselves in the drive to build new cities, new
towers. The poet concludes that all such towers, from Nineveh to New
York, are attempts to put into material form a vision of a "Celestial
City/ Blinding in the sky!" (Ben&eacute;t, "The Singing Skyscraper,"
5). "The Singing Skyscrapers" is a fascinating, if uneven, attempt to
update a key mode of Romantic poetry, the rhapsodic spiritual epiphany,
into an ultramodern urban setting.

<p>
<a name="FOOT45" href="#REF45">45</a>.
To New Yorkers of the 1910s, the Woolworth Building's twenty-eight
state-of-the-art elevators were objects of intense fascination: the
system was monitored from the lobby by an electric dispatcher mechanism,
while each car contained a phone capable of contacting any location
in the country, and enough safety cushions that a 7000 pound cargo was
once test-dropped in free-fall from the 45th floor to the bottom without
spilling a full glass of water in the car (<i>COC</i>, 14-15, 19). These
reassuring facts notwithstanding, Teasdale is mesmerized by the aura of
sublimity that the elevator achieves through its gravity-defying rate
of speed. In the 1910s, the two elevators going from the ground to the
observation deck in the Woolworth Building were the fastest in the world,
routinely running at 700 feet per minute (<i>COC</i>, 14).

In addition to the three poems mentioned above and the two discussed in
detail below, the Metropolitan Tower is a central element in Stephen
Vincent Ben&eacute;t's 1920 love lyric "Chanson at Madison Square"
(in Stephen Vincent Ben&eacute;t, <i>Heavens and Earth</i> [New York:
Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co., 1920], 46). And although Robert Frost's
small masterpiece of modern alienation "Acquainted With the Night"
 refers to no specific buildings by name, I propose that many
early urbanite readers would almost certainly have thought of the
Metropolitan Tower upon encountering the poem's culminating image, "One
luminary clock against the sky" at an "unearthly height" (<i>The Poetry
of Robert Frost</i>, ed. Edward Connery Lathem [New York: Henry Holt,
1969], 255-56). The Metropolitan's famous electric-powered clock, its
illuminated faces three stories tall on all four sides of the building,
its minute hands weighing 1000 pounds each, was the largest in the
world. At more than 350 feet up, it was certainly the "unearthliest"
of all clocks of the era, visible from almost anywhere in the city.

<b></b>

Some have taken Frost's luminary clock as a clock, others as the moon. To
me it seems clear that both readings are fully available; clock and
moon merge in a modern cityscape so alienating that traditional natural
and modern technological measures of value are equally dysfunctional,
proclaiming only their own lack of meaning, and rendering time itself
"neither wrong nor right" (Frost, "Acquainted with the Night," 256).

A 1914 guidebook describes the illumination of the building's clock
and tower most fully: "As the evening darkness draws near, at any
predetermined hour for which the mechanism may be adjusted, hundreds
of electric lights appear back of the dial numerals, all of which
are brilliantly illuminated with splendid effect&#8212;a feature
never produced by any other clock in the world. Simultaneously with
the illumination of the hands and dials, an automatically actuated
switch lights up a great electric octagonal lantern, eight feet in
diameter, located at the top of the tower, from which powerful electric
flash-lights, marking the hours in the evening, may be seen for a great
distance, far beyond any possible transmission of sound, the time being
signalled therefrom as follows: Each of the quarter-hours is flashed in
red and the hours in white light&#8212;one red flash for the quarter,
two red flashes for the half, three red flashes for three-quarters, and
four red flashes for the even hour&#8212;these latter flashes followed
by a number of white flashes marking the hour" (<i>MLIC</i>, 48). As
of the spring of 2001, the refurbished Metropolitan Tower was again
offering a nightly light show; but the current effects, which involve
a continuous series of gradual color changes on the top levels of the
building, do not create a flashlight effect, nor do they measure time
as the original ones did. The tower's great illuminated clock still runs.

For a leftist poet such as Ridge, this image of topheavy spindle-legged
res unable to support the weight being placed upon them applies to
the numbers as well, an instability that would be dramatized within
a few years by the market crash that nearly brought down the entire
capitalist edifice.
