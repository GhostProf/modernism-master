<p>In his recent biography of the modernist sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>], Paul O'Keeffe points to a puzzle that continues to baffle historians: what compelling change in perspective would cause a self-declared anti-militarist—whose principled opposition to the French army remained steadfast at least until Spring 1913—to enthusiastically volunteer for service when war broke out in early August 1914?<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Having moved to London from Paris in January 1911, Gaudier-Brzeska rose to prominence after exhibiting his sculpture at the July 1913 Allied Artists Association exhibition; he then befriended the poet Ezra Pound and, in 1914, became a founding member of the English Vorticists. Gaudier contributed a manifesto to the Vorticist's journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span> in June 1914 and following his voluntary enlistment in the French army he published a second manifesto written while in the trenches in the July 1915 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span>. The second edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span> also included a brief notice, titled "Mort pour la patrie," stating that Gaudier-Brzeska had been killed on June 5, 1915 "after a month of ting and two promotions for gallantry."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska's dramatic shift from ardent anti-militarist to an enthusiastic wartime combatant seems all the more perplexing given his pre-war commitment to anarchism and the role played by the anti-militarist, anarchist-oriented journals <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> (1906–1915) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> (1908–1923) in his ideological development from Spring 1910 onward.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Of these two journals it is <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> that has attracted the attention of Gaudier-Brzeska's biographers: for instance, O'Keeffe, Evelyn Silber, and Roger Secrétain describe the anti-militarism espoused  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> by <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale's</span> founder Gustave Hervé (1871–1944) as the cornerstone for Gaudier's anarchist beliefs and for his refusal, in October 1912, to fulfill his military service, which was mandatory for all French males upon their 21st birthday.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In this essay, I will study Gaudier-Brzeska's French activist roots in greater detail to examine how various types of violence, culled from the spheres of politics, ideology, and popular culture, helped shape Gaudier's life and art from 1910 to his death in 1915. In so doing, I will show how Gaudier's political formation in France and England was filtered through his ongoing exposure to <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>. In contrast to O'Keeffe, who reduces Gaudier-Brzeska's ideological development to a series of fragmented episodes without internal coherence, or Secrétain, who attributes Gaudier-Brzeska's abrupt transition from French anarchist to French patriot to the pernicious influence, in 1913–14, of the English triumvirate T.E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, and Ezra Pound, I would argue that the sculptor's ideological transformation in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> England was the legacy of his French radicalism.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> While the scholarship on the cultural 137 politics of the Vorticists Hulme, Lewis, and Pound is substantial, that on Gaudier-Brzeska remains scant aside from the writing of his biographers. Literary scholars have tended to consider only Gaudier's Vorticist phase, and even then he has been treated as a kind of passive muse for the politicized art criticism of his Vorticist colleagues.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> By considering the profound impact of French anarchism on Gaudier-Brzeska's art and activism, I hope to rectify this situation and to further enrich our understanding of Gaudier's unique role in the cultural politics of English modernism.</p>
<p>Gaudier's ongoing interest in anarchism led him to endorse aestheticized violence as a form of resistance to the punitive force of the State, whether in the guise of judicial sentencing, police repression, or compulsory service in the French military. In the artistic realm, Gaudier explored the medium of caricature as well as highly sexualized imagery as a visual counterpart to his oppositional politics, and self-styled status as a working-class bohemian who mocked the moral codes and values of the bourgeoisie. Though in support of radically different agendas, both the anarchists and the French State sought to justify acts of violence on moral and aesthetic grounds. As I will demonstrate, these conflicting discourses became mutually reinforcing once the anarchists and socialists deployed their views on morality and culture in support of the French war effort in August 1914. As we shall see, Gaudier-Brzeska's own anarchist politics were fully implicated in these events. To address such issues, we must begin by considering the complex interrelation of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> to <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>, and the role of both journals to the broader socialist and anarchist movements in France.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Social War of Gustave Hervé and Victor Méric</h1>
<p>Gustave Hervé, who was profiled in one of the earliest issues of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> (February 1908), is widely recognized to have had a major impact on socialists and anarchists before 1914; indeed following the political formation of the French Socialist Party in 1905, Hervé became a political "star" wielding tremendous influence within the Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière up to 1911.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> After 1905, Hervé headed a left-wing faction of the Party known as the "Hervéists" who were dedicated to anti-militarism and endorsed the anarchist notion of revolutionary opposition to the plutocratic State through mass insurrection. Concurrently, Hervé published his antimilitarist manifesto, <span style="font-style:italic;">Leur patrie</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Their Country</span>) , which declared patriotism and socialism to be incompatible. Hervé argued that the concept of <span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span> in France had been exploited to serve the interests of the privileged classes, that all nations in Europe shared the same fate, and that the working class throughout Europe should respond to declarations of war with a refusal to take up arms in support of the government's version of <span style="font-style:italic;">la patrie</span>. Instead workers were to foment an armed insurrection and general strike to bring down the government and destroy the power of the bourgeoisie.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Hervé argued that the concept of <span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span> was a key myth in the arsenal of the ruling classes, an illusion promoted by the plutocratic State through education, the Church, the theater, literature, and the press. It was through a "poisoning that begins in the cradle  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that [the bourgeoisie] succeeds in impressing upon those poor wretches who possess nothing, and for whom the 'country' is a step-mother, that they should go die for her joyously."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> If war were declared, the French left would first sabotage the mobilization of reservists, then call for the desertion of socialists and anarchist sympathizers within the military rank and file, and simultaneously organize a working class insurrection while the army—now in mutinous disarray—was occupied at the front. Hervé found allies for his program among the anarchists and members of anarcho-syndicalist unions who shared his belief that the military was the tool of moneyed interests. The anarchists, like Hervé, also held that a general strike in the midst of national crisis could topple the government.</p>
<p>Moreover the Hervéist and anarchist claim that the French army was the tool of wealthy industrialists had some basis in fact. Throughout the prewar period, the French government had used the army to suppress strike activity: notorious instances included the killing of five demonstrators in Narbonne by the 139<sup>th</sup> Infantry in June 1907, and the massacre of workers by the army at Draveil and Villeneuve-Saint-George in 1908<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup>. Such actions were critiqued by radical artists within the anti-militarist movement. The prominent anarchist cartoonist Jules Félix Grandjouan (1875–1968)—who contributed art and art criticism to <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>—commemorated the Narbonne massacre in an inflammatory drawing for the official journal of the anarcho-syndicalist movement, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Voix du peuple</span> (1900–1939) [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. Published in October 1907 under the title "Return of the Narbonne Soldier to his Parents," the illustration showed a mother spitting on her soldier-son who had just returned from suppressing a strike. While the father looks on in horror, Grandjouan supplements the mother's gesture with the memorable declamation "Oh! Jackass! You fired on the People!" In this manner, the real mother of the proletariat exhibited her wrath towards a son who had betrayed her by marching to the tune of Hervé's unnatural "step mother," <span style="font-style:italic;">la patrie</span>.</p>
<p>To promote their own anti-militarist program the anarchists complemented Hervé's campaign by founding the French wing of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Association Internationale Antimilitariste</span>.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The prominent anarchists Miguel Almereyda (Eugène Vigo) (1883–1917) and Georges Yvetot (1861–1943) headed the French section of delegates to the AIA's first Congress, held in Amsterdam on June 26–28, 1904. Yet another committed member was the self-declared anarchist Victor "Flax" Méric (1876–1933), who published an infamous AIA pamphlet titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Lettre à un conscrit</span> in November 1906, to coincide with the annual Autumn departure of conscripts to their military barracks.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Modeled after Yvetot's earlier <span style="font-style:italic;">Nouveau manuel du soldat</span> , Méric's brochure instructed conscripts to "choose your victims" if called upon to fire on striking workers; this veiled invitation to execute their own officers proved too much for the government which promptly indicted Méric and moved to suppress the AIA.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Most importantly it was Almereyda, Méric, and their anarcho-syndicalist and anti-militarist comrade Eugène Merle who collaborated with Hervé in founding <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> in December 1906. When Méric in turn founded <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> in 1908, the initial collaboration between Aristide Delannoy as cartoonist for the cover and Méric as author of the text, profiling each "man of the day," soon expanded to include contributions by Almereyda <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">(3 October 1908) and a regular section devoted to the avant-garde Salon d'automne and Salon des Indépendants (beginning 17 October 1908). As of 13 February 1909, the leftist art critic Maurice Robin joined the group, soon to be followed by another critic, Henri Guilbeaux, who took up the role of in-house art critic in January 1911. Robin and Guilbeaux were enthusiastic supporters of the Neo-Impressionists, in part due to their admiration for the anarcho-communist beliefs of the Neo-Impressionist <span style="font-style:italic;">chef</span>, Paul Signac, and his literary ally Jean Grave. The list of contributors expanded after 1911 to include res sympathetic to the Fauvists and Cubists, notably the socialist politician and art collector Marcel Sembat, the anarchist art historian and critic Élie Faure, and Pierre Dumont, an artist closely affiliated with the salon Cubists. Thus Gaudier-Brzeska was perceptive in October 1910 when he characterized <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">du jour</span> as the cultural counterpart to <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>, for the two journals were closely connected.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Liabeuf Affair</h1>
<p>Secrétain and O'Keeffe rightly point to Henri Gaudier-Brzeska's participation in a July 1, 1910 demonstration against the imminent execution in Paris of the worker "Liabeuf" as the first evidence of the artist's reaction to the leftist activism propagated in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> In analyzing Gaudier-Brzeska's response to the event, O'Keeffe relies on the memoir of the sculptor's friend and fellow artist Horace Brodzky detailing Gaudier-Brzeska's involvement in the demonstration, which ended in a police assault on the protestors. While Secrétain merely cites Gaudier-Brzeska's participation as evidence of his anarchist convictions, O'Keeffe draws different conclusions, suggesting on the basis of Brodzky's recollections that the artist's presence should not be confused with a steadfast allegiance to Hervé's political program. However, to properly ascertain Gaudier-Brzeska's motives, we need to delve deeper into the causes behind Liabeuf's arrest and the politicization of Liabeuf's incarceration by Hervé and Méric.</p>
<p>The shoemaker Jean Jacques Liabeuf was sentenced to death by guillotine for murdering a policeman and wounding six others on January 8, 1910.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Liabeuf, whose notoriety even drew the attention of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>, had apparently armed himself with a revolver, a cobbler's knife, and wrists encased in leather guards with nails in preparation for his assault on the "flics."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The word "Apache," which was applied to Liabeuf by the French and foreign Press, was a derisive term commonly used to describe outlaws from the underclass who committed random acts of violence. In the French imagination, these street toughs were as uncontrollable, licentious, and primitive as their mythic namesakes, the Apache Indians indigenous to the American south west.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Thus the article documenting Liabeuf's exploits in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> chronicled French concerns over the morally corrupt condition of "Apache" youths who had formed street gangs and developed their own criminal subculture.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> countered such stereotypes by questioning the morality of the police and casting Liabeuf as the victim of police repression. Following his arrest, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> recounted the events leading up to the July 1 State execution in a manner meant to elicit their reader's sympathy for Liabeuf. In a January 10, 1910 <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> article titled "L'Exemple de l'Apache," Hervé described Liabeuf's actions as an act of revenge for an earlier charge. On August 14, 1909—four months before assaulting the police—Liabeuf had been sentenced to three months on charges of being a pimp. Hervé in turn argued that Liabeuf's only "crime" had been to fall in love with a prostitute, and that it was the police, whom he would later term the "Apaches of morality," who had wrongly labeled the relationship an economic arrangement. According to Hervé, Liabeuf thought the charge had sullied his honor as well as that of his girlfriend: he therefore sought revenge by attacking the policemen who had originally arrested him. Hervé described Liabeuf's actions as possessing "a certain beauty, a certain grandeur"; he also asserted that "Apaches"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> such as Liabeuf were driven to violence as a result of the social and economic injustice inflicted on them.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The government responded quickly, accusing Hervé of inciting murder and vindicating a criminal act. On March 7, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> announced that Hervé had been sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of 1000 francs (the sentence was later reduced to two years).<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> On January 23, 1910, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> published Victor Méric's robust defense of Liabeuf and Hervé titled "The History of Apaches." Méric noted Hervé's self-professed admiration for the "energy and audacity" of so-called Apaches like Liabeuf, and he endorsed Hervé's further claim that the police were only Apaches of another type, whose sole purpose was to protect "the inviolability of private property." The police were aided in their mission by "the apaches of the army, of the magistrature," and ultimately, "of the government and of finance." Liabeuf and Hervé therefore were the victims of a plutocratic State, and their respective actions now took on symbolic significance as heroic signs of resistance. Over the period leading up to Liabeuf's execution, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> launched a campaign against "the Apaches" of the legal system by publishing Liabeuf's written justification for his actions and highlighting the judicial and punitive persecution of prostitutes throughout French history.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> The campaign culminated in the June 30 special issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> headlined "Pardon for Liabeuf! You cannot Guillotine him!" The journal combined a call for a mass demonstration in front of the prison where Liabeuf was to be executed with an article attesting to Liabeuf's "beautiful bearing" in the face of his impending execution.</p>
<p>Taken together, these articles point to the mythic transformation, under the auspices of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>, of Liabeuf's crime into an anarchist act of "propaganda by the deed." Historians have noted that anarchists before 1914 frequently aestheticized acts of violence committed by ardent revolutionaries: for example when the self-declared anarchist Auguste Vaillant tossed a nail bomb into the Chamber of Deputies on December 9, 1893, fellow anarchist Laurent Tailhade famously declaimed: "What do the victims matter if the gesture is beautiful?"<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> took up this anarchist rhetoric by aestheticizing Liabeuf's act of violence and declaring it an appropriate response to the false morality of a State that condoned social and economic inequality. Another agenda embedded in Hervé's interpretation of Liabeuf's motives concerned the issue of policing of sexual mores and the persecution of prostitutes. <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> adamantly condemned the capitalist exploitation of prostitutes while calling for universal sex education and the widespread use of contraception as a means of separating consensual sex from procreation.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Thus <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> melded themes of sexual liberation, State repression, and anarchist rebellion into a compact narrative concerning Liabeuf's unfolding plight.</p>
<p>This argument was developed further following Liabeuf's execution. The July 3 front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>, devoted solely to Liabeuf, contained a drawing of the "victime des apaches des moeurs" along with his final declaration, "I am not a pimp!" [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]. It also included an article describing the public demonstration against the execution the previous evening. Hervé's journal noted that 20,000 copies of the special  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> were distributed free of charge by "young and valiant comrades of the Socialist youth and revolutionaries of Paris… in all the working-class quarters."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Thus Gaudier-Brzeska may well have received news of the call to demonstrate publically against Liabeuf's impending execution from one of these ardent revolutionaries. Gaudier-Brzeska was not the only aspiring artist to heed the call: the writer André Salmon—a close friend of Picasso—joined the protest along with the art critic Léon Werth, writer Paul Adam, and Salmon's friend, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> editor Miguel Almereyda.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Such links point to the broader impact of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> among the literary and artistic avant-garde. The anarchist Charles Malato, writing in the July 9 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>, praised the proletarians, artists, and writers who had gathered that evening to defend the "hero" Liabeuf, noting that this poor worker had received a death sentence for the noble act of "avenging his honor."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> As a participant, Gaudier-Brzeska would have relished such descriptions, which cast his own decision to join the protest in epic proportions as part of an ongoing t for the revolutionary cause.</p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>It is with such thoughts in mind that we can now turn to O'Keeffe's interpretation of the episode. Although he notes that Gaudier-Brzeska probably first heard of Liabeuf's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> arrest by reading Hervé's January 10 article in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>, he does not follow the journal's unfolding treatment of the Affair, but instead refers to a description of the June 30 demonstration culled from the mainstream British media, the London <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report cited by O'Keeffe described "an immense crowd of roughs" gathering in the vicinity of the prison and the ensuing confrontation between the police, the "Republican Guards" and "the jeunesse révolutionnaire who had mustered in full force." O'Keeffe then turns to Horace Brodzky's reminiscences of Gaudier-Brzeska's retelling of the event, proclaiming it to be reliable by virtue of its compatibility with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> But how reliable is Brodzky's account? Brodzky's version robs Gaudier-Bzreska of all agency, as if to imply that he stumbled into the event rather than purposely attending it out of strong and principled conviction. According to Brodzky, the artist was "carried away" by the crowd's enthusiasm; he "found himself drawn into trouble and swallowed up in the crowd." The protesters are labeled "the mob" and Gaudier-Brzeska thought the whole event "great fun," rather than an activist outcry against the brutal execution of a political victim.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> Given Gaudier-Brzeska's adamant identification with anarchism, anti-militarism, and the cause of proletarian revolution, it could be argued that Brodzky's account deliberately drains the politics from his friend's actions. This is all the more likely in as much as Brodzky, who first met Gaudier-Brzeska in December 1912, seems to have assumed that, because his friend did not discuss politics with him, he was uninterested in politics altogether. "Brzeska did not concern himself with politics," Brodzky asserted, before adding the following qualifier, "or at least I never heard him discuss them."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Most importantly, O'Keeffe does not consider <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale's</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour's</span> sympathetic analyses of Liabeuf. Although the latter versions were decidedly partisan, the fact that Gaudier-Brzeska's own involvement stemmed directly from <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>'s call to arms suggests that Hervé and Méric's politicized interpretation of Liabeuf's actions give us better insight into Gaudier-Brzeska's motivations at the time. <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> had celebrated Liabeuf's status as a martyr to a noble and beautiful cause that ran counter to the corrupt moral standards and rampant injustice of the State. For an aspiring artist and revolutionary like Gaudier-Brzeska, this conflation of art and leftist politics with the heroic violence of an Apache—who defied public morality by loving a prostitute—must have been compelling.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Gaudier-Brzeska as an Apache</h1>
<p>Indeed Gaudier-Brzeska's public persona following his move to London in January 1911 may owe something to Hervé and Méric's aestheticized veneration of Liabeuf. As Lisa Tickner has demonstrated, the term "Apache" and its related associations, both sexual and anarchist, had already migrated to London well before Gaudier's arrival in January 1911.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> The mythic image of the Apache had a profound impact on the future Vorticist Wyndham Lewis, who first befriended Gaudier-Brzeska sometime in the Fall of 1913. In his painting <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lovers</span> of 1912 [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>], Lewis captured the aggressive sexuality associated with the French hooligan by modeling his depiction of two working-class <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

He was probably familiar with descriptions of the Apache way of life by fellow bohemians like the leftist Aristide Bruant, whose fin-de-siècle cabaret songs detailed the unruly activities of the youthful Apaches who inhabited lower class dance halls and cafés.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> In June 1914, Lewis praised Paris in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span> for introducing "the Ballads of its Prehistoric Apache," a "rebellious adolescent," to the European public, thus underscoring the cultural and generational dimension of the Apache myth.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Lewis's Vorticist manifesto not only alludes to the French Apache's supposed love of music, but to the translation of this form of entertainment into the so-called "Apache dance," then wildly popular in up-scale night clubs in Paris and London.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Thus Lewis's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lovers</span> was one among a series of works that culminated in his lost canvas <span style="font-style:italic;">Kermesse</span> , which focused on the Apache-related theme of eroticism and violence on the dance floor. <span style="font-style:italic;">Kermesse</span>—the title of which alludes to carnivalesque depictions of the Flemish peasantry painted by Pieter Breugel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens—was originally designed for inclusion in the avant-garde London Cabaret known as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cave of the Golden Calf</span>.

<p class="continued">was first taken to the Club in June 1912 by a founding member and patron Haldane MacFall; Sophie Brzeska later described the establishment as a favorite haunt among members of England's wealthy "plutocracy."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The very title of this <span style="font-style:italic;">chic</span> cabaret conjures with the Old Testament story of licentious idol-worship among the Israelites, thereby suggesting that drunken revelry and sexual abandon awaited any costumer who dared to enter the establishment.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Lewis sketch for <span style="font-style:italic;">Kermesse</span> [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>]—dominated by hard-edge angles and metallic blues and greys—served to reinforce the theme by portraying the dancing res at the center of the painting as under impending threat by a re lunching violently forward from the bottom right. The painting also alluded to a key component of the Apache persona, for French newspapers frequently reported that dance halls in Montmartre and Montparnasse had become the arena for violent battles between Apache youths for the attention of their female counterparts.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> In contrast  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to Gaudier, whose exposure to the Apache was mediated through the anarchist press, Lewis' interest in working-class youth culture was filtered through the craze, among self-styled bohemians, for a commercialized version of the Apache legend. Whereas Hervé and Méric assimilated an aestheticized image of the anarchist Apache into their radical politics, the Apache dance and its literary offshoots arguably domesticated this symbol of working class revolt by catering to middle class youths such as Lewis, who were eager to test the limits of bourgeois propriety.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> All this would have been self-evident to Gaudier when he first saw Lewis's work at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cave of the Golden Calf</span> in 1912 and later joined Lewis in founding the artists' collective known as the Rebel Art Center in March 1914.</p>
<p>By the summer of 1913, Gaudier-Brzeska was an established member of London's artistic bohemia, but he frequently took its anti-establishment tenets of sexual freedom and hostility to bourgeois morality to extremes worthy of an Hervéist or anarchist "Apache." Before coming to London, Gaudier had been practicing his own version of sexual liberation with Sophie Brzeska, whom he described in 1910 as "an anarchist—simply and naturally" by virtue of her independent character.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> In an October 9, 1913 letter to his lover Sophie, Gaudier-Brzeska casually informed her of his visit, with fellow artist Alfred Wolmark, "to a café à putains," a café full of prostitutes, while Ede and O'Keeffe recount numerous reports of the sculptor's eager participation in brawls with local street toughs.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In her memoirs, Sophie Brzeska recorded a visit with Ezra Pound in the Fall of 1913 during which Gaudier told Pound of his scuffle with "une bande d'apaches anglais."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska also enjoyed eating and drinking in proletarian taverns and greasy spoons, wherein he actively identified with the coarse behavior of the male workers and street hooligans who frequented such establishments. Brodzky later recalled that his friend sought out run-down "cafes" on the Upper King's Road in Chelsea, noting that "he had no dislike of the cracked cups and positively enjoyed the obscene talk of truck-men, and the general roughness of the place."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Wolmark cemented Gaudier-Brzeska's reputation as an unruly bohemian when he exhibited a portrait of the artist at the third annual exhibition of the National Portrait Society at the Grosvenor Gallery in February 1914 [<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>]. Wolmark signaled his friend's ideological allegiances by casting him as an anti-bourgeois rebel, dressed in red and black, the colors of the anarchist movement.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> His portrait placed the artist against a crimson background, with his bodily frame nearly reaching the top of this six-foot high canvas. Dressed in an imposing black hat, coal-black trousers, black boots, a body-length black cape, and a collarless, scarlet-red shirt, Gaudier-Brzeska is portrayed with a gesticulating left hand and open palm, while his gaunt face is painted in a garish combination of Fauve greens and reds. As O'Keeffe aptly puts it: "he looks like a stage anarchist rehearsing the throwing of a bomb."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska's conflation of unbridled sexuality, violence, and an Apache attitude found a ready outlet through his friendship, beginning in July 1913, with the poet Ezra Pound, and, in 1914, with the self-styled philosopher T. E. Hulme. Pound actively promoted the sculptor's work in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> (1914–19), a journal that supported birth control, the anarchist doctrine of free love, and advocated a version of anarcho-individualism <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">modeled on the ideas Max Stirner. Hulme in turn was an enthusiast of the French anarcho-syndicalist Georges Sorel, whose highly influential book <span style="font-style:italic;">Reflections on Violence</span>  aestheticized proletarian violence in the form of the general strike.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> In 1914, Hulme began promoting the work of Jacob Epstein, Gaudier-Brzeska, and Lewis in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Age</span> and invited the Vorticists to participate in his weekly literary Salon, held every Tuesday at his home on Frith Street.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In addition Hulme, Lewis, and Pound celebrated an aggressive form of male virility as an expression of their anti-bourgeois values. Scholars have noted that Gaudier-Brzeska's phallic <span style="font-style:italic;">Head of Ezra Pound</span>  [<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>] was one such manifestation of the merger of anarchism, primitivism, and themes of male virility among the London avant-garde.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> The sculptor Jacob Epstein recalled that "Pound instructed Gaudier to make the Head virile" while Lewis later described Gaudier's sculpted homage as "Ezra in the form of a marble phallus." Gaudier's artist friend Horace Brodzky complained that there was "too much sex talk" among the Vorticist group, adding that the Head's "purpose and beginning were entirely pornographic."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Other signifiers of Vorticist virility in Gaudier-Brzeska's arsenal were the series of "knuckle dusters" he cut from brass in 1914 for Lewis and T.E. Hulme.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> The Apache associations of these implements were self-evident, for brass knuckles, along with the switch blade and hand gun were described in the press as  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the weapons of choice among street gangs in London and Paris.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Hulme's lover, Kate Lechmere, described the iconography of one such Gaudier-Brzeska "duster," now in a private collection (see issue cover image): "The two pieces curving out sideways at the bottom are the woman's parted legs. The central hole is the vagina, and the four holes at the top are the woman's head tossing and turning as she achieves orgasm."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> Evidently Gaudier-Brzeska's commitment to the anarchist spirit of rebellion—exemplified by the "Apache" Liabeuf—was still in full force in 1914, albeit through the mediating lens of his new-found allies among the London avant-garde.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">The Artists of Les Hommes du jour: Jean-Louis Forain and Théophile Steinlen</h1>
<p>While Gaudier's encounter with Lewis and Pound gave new relevance to his anarchist conception of the Paris Apache, his art before the summer of 1913 attests to the impact of those activist artists championed by <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> on his evolving aesthetic. In his October 4, 1910 letter announcing his allegiance to anarchism, Gaudier-Brzeska singled out three artists for special praise: Théophile Steinlen, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, and above all, Jean-Louis Forain, a follower of Edgar Degas most famous for his satirical images of the licentious life-style of the French bourgeoisie.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> Gaudier informed Dr. Uhlemayr <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">that, "as a rule, when I go to sleep I am glad to wake and see the day and to look at the lovely engraving by Steinlen or a poster by Toulouse-Lautrec which I have." Gaudier's drawings from the period make plain his debt to the anarchist-inflected subject matter favored by Steinlen. In a Paris sketchbook dated to 1910, Gaudier did a series of drawings of workers, cart horses, and industrial boats along the Seine, as well as a poignant image of a poverty stricken family, made homeless by the flooding of Paris in the winter of 1910 [<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>]. This drawing of a downtrodden mother holding a baby while her husband bends under the weight of a sack containing all their worldly possessions brings to mind images of itinerant families—both peasant and proletarian—by committed anarchists such as Camille Pissarro and Steinlen.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> In sketch books completed before he settled in France in the Fall of 1909, Gaudier had focused on the Roman and Gothic edifices he encountered in Bristol, Bath, and Nuremburg, but in his Paris sketchbook—concurrent with his commitment to anarchism—images of the urban proletariat are given sudden prominence.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> In October of the same year, Gaudier praised the "perfect anarchy" inherent in Forain's drawings, thus making it clear that his views on drawing technique had ideological import (a subject he would return to in 1911). That assessment appears in a letter to Dr. Uhlemayr disparaging the philosopher Hippolyte Taine's positivist tract, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Philosophy of Art</span> : <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I have been reading Taine's <span style="font-style:italic;">Philosophy of Art</span>. His theory does not seem to me to be very sound. It is true that environment does have an influence, but what has a much greater effect on the artist is love or hatred. He uses his setting to express these things—that is how I see it. Take, for example, Forain—the best of draughtsmen, in my opinion. This man has been made spiteful by the misery of his early years; he began his work in a spirit of implacable raillery against the customs and manners of his contemporaries; today the influence of his surrounding has modified enormously—he is rich. The setting has changed but the artist has become more intransigent and malicious than before. His drawings breathe the strength of perfect anarchy. That this powerful personality dominates his surroundings is a thing Taine never explains.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Gaudier-Brzeska's choice of artists is telling, for Lautrec, Forain, and Steinlen all had strong links to the fin-de-siècle anarchist milieu. Richard Sonn in his book on the anarchist movement during the 1890s has documented the support these three artists garnered in anarchist circles<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup>; what is significant for our purposes is their continued lionization in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>. Retrospective exhibitions of Lautrec's work were repeatedly celebrated in the pages of the journal (see for instance, "Toulouse-Lautrec," 7 November 1908); Theophile Steinlen, himself a committed anarchist, designed the cover for a special edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> devoted to "War and the Warriors" (1 February 1911); while Forain—a close friend of Steinlen and a contributor to the anarchist journal <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Assiette au buerre</span> (1901–1912)—was declared "man of the day" for the 26 February 1910 issue.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> In the accompanying article—which Gaudier-Brzeska surely would have read—Maurice Robin charted Forain's rise from humble origins (his father was a sign painter) to a condition of wealth, all the while marveling at the artist's unrelenting criticism of the social decadence and political corruption stemming from the reign of the bourgeoisie. Robin noted that Forain's change in fortunes did little to stem the anti-parliamentary vitriol of his cartoons, nor had Forain lost the ideological fervor that led him to participate in the French commune.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> In fact, Gaudier-Brzeska's celebration of Forain's intransigence in his critique of Taine was a virtual <span style="font-style:italic;">repris</span>e of Maurice Robin's earlier assessment of the artist: it is no wonder that he attributed "the strength of perfect anarchy" to Forain's drawings.</p>
<p>As Evelyn Silber has demonstrated, Gaudier's rejection of Taine was also part and parcel of his embrace of philosopher Henri Bergson's notion of life as a durational flux, which in turn inspired his preoccupation with capturing movement, whether in the guise of bodies in motion in the streets of Paris and London, or through his evolving method of drawing. While attending life-drawing classes in London in the Fall of 1912, Gaudier was in the habit of working at a frenetic pace, literally creating hundreds of drawings in a single session and often capturing the models while resting between poses [<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>]. Employing a stylographic pen, Gaudier reduced the bodily mass of the sitters to a thin line, frequently moving around the model to capture several viewpoints, exaggerating portions of their anatomy, and failing to circumscribe the body so as to suggest the potential for movement. His technique was clearly indebted to Rodin's pronouncements on modeling in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Art</span> , but it was also in keeping with the rapid, reportage technique he used in his sketch books to capture an anarchist perspective of the quotidian world around him.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Art and Censorship: The case of Aristide Delannoy</h1>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska's anarchist self-fashioning is also closely related to his early interest in the drawing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour's</span> chief artist, Aristide Delannoy (1874–1911).<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> On May 19, 1911, Gaudier expressed his profound sadness to Sophie on reading in <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> of Delannoy's death at the early age of 37. For anarchist activists Delannoy was nothing short of a hero: sentenced to a year in the Santé prison in 1908 for publishing a caricature deemed to be a scornful invective against the army, Delannoy died prematurely as a direct result of the prison's sordid conditions. "I am very fond of his way of drawing," Gaudier-Brzeska wrote, before asking Sophie to "pray to the beautiful sun for Delannoy."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> On June 30, 1911 he returned to the subject of Delannoy, stating his intention to purchase a portrait print of the dead artist for 2 francs 50 as a token of his love for Sophie. The print was in fact based on a death-bed portrait of the artist by his friend Gaston Raieter, designed for the cover of the May 13, 1911 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> [<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>].<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> Such comments are a measure of Gaudier-Brzeska's spiritual and artistic identification with the re of Delannoy, which prompts me to consider the possible impact of Delannoy on Gaudier-Brzeska's art in Paris and during  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> his first years in London. Given Delannoy's exalted place in his artistic pantheon, the history of this anarchist's imprisonment is worth recounting.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup></p>

<p>In October 1908, Delannoy and Victor Méric were each sentenced to the extraordinary term of one year in prison and a fine of 3000 francs for their collaboration on a May 1908 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> profiling General Albert d'Amade, who had led the military's infamous suppression of a rebellion in French-occupied Morocco [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 11</a>]. Known as the "Chaouia Campaign," the army assault began in January 1908, when d'Amade initiated a scorched earth policy in the region around Casablanca. From January through to April 1908, the French press reported that troops bombed and sacked local villages, indiscriminately killing men, women and children.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> Delannoy's caricature depicted d'Amade as a bloody butcher, dressed in his military regalia and gazing with pride at a burning village littered with the bodies of whole families. Méric's article in turn was a text-book example of Hervéist anti-militarism. Méric began by declaring the army the tool of high finance, noting that "noble" phrases like "for the Country [<span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span>]" were routinely evoked by European governments to justify the pillaging of newly created colonies abroad, especially in North Africa. Méric then drew a distinction between life-long soldiers like d'Amade and the poor conscripts under his command. Whereas d'Amade and his ilk were "professional murderers" who "lived for war," the foot soldiers under his leadership were to be pitied. They, too, were victims of State oppression, for their humanity was degraded as a result of d'Amade's orders to attack the civilian population in Morocco. To underscore the gap between the myth of military  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> virtue and the grisly actualities in Morocco, Méric closed his article by reproducing a newspaper dispatch from <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Matin</span> documenting one such military assault, and then punctuating <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Matin</span>'s description of the "sea of blood" resulting from the French attack with the phrases "Brave French Soldiers!," "Valiant French Soldiers!," "Admirable French Soldiers!." This discourse was repeated in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>, which regularly published anti-militarist diatribes against the Moroccan campaign from 1907 to 1911, during the height of the French military incursion.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Thus when the government moved to charge Delannoy and Méric it claimed that the caricature and the accompanying text were an "insult" to the military.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska endorsed Hervé and Méric's anti-militarist assessment of the Moroccan scandal, writing to Dr. Uhlemayr on January 3, 1913 that he had "deserted their [the French] Army" in part because the French military were "slaughterers of the Arabs."<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> The sculptor's reference to "their army" was a clear allusion to Hervé's famous condemnation of "their <span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span>;" thus signaling the ideological genealogy of his anti-militarism.</p>

</div>
<p>The government's claim that Delannoy and Méric had insulted the military was a carefully worded accusation.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> This legal terminology derived from the Press Law of July, 1881, which specified that defamation of institutions fulfilling a public function, including the army and navy, was a punishable offense. The law went on to define defamation as the overt imputation of a fact which injured the honor or esteem to the aggrieved institution, but specified that the truth of the imputed fact "discharged the complaint."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> As with the trail of Liabeuf, the authority to commit acts of violence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> was at issue, with the government proclaiming its right to defend the morality of its institutions against its critics. By claiming that the army was honorable, the State wished to signify that the violent actions of the military were governed by qualities of self-discipline and ethical responsibility that exempted it from criticism. Delannoy, whose case was publicized in the anarchist journal <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Assiette au beurre</span>, challenged this legal argument by defending his drawing as an accurate representation of the French military's activities in Morocco. He rested his case by declaring that "I don't have two moralities and I approve no crime."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Thus Delannoy accused the French government of practicing a double standard. While the legal system proclaimed the army to be the guardian of French moral conduct, evidence showed that the government's military campaign in Morocco broke every ethical code imaginable. Far from behaving honorably on the field of battle, the French military had engaged in criminal activity by any legal standard. Thus in Delannoy's estimation, the Third Republic had contradicted its own laws by ignoring the truth and accusing him of defamation.</p>
<p>On October 3, 1908, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> published the outcome of the trial, as well as biographical profiles of the two "criminals"; this was followed by a short notice in the 6 March 1909 issue announcing that Delannoy's sentence had been reduced due to his ill health. The July 3, 1909 issue relayed the happy news that Delannoy had finally been released from prison, but spoke no further about his declining health.<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Over 1909 and to the end of 1910, Delannoy's caricatures continued to grace the covers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>; but from December 30 on, his cover illustrations only appeared intermittently, under the signature "Interim Delannoy." Between January and March 1911, Delannoy published a series of inmate portraits, sketched during his internment [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 12</a>],<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> then on May 13, 1911, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> announced the startling news of Delannoy's demise. This issue, which Gaudier-Brzeska read,<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> included a moving biography of the artist's life by Victor Méric and a separate homage by art critic Henri Guilbeaux, who drew a metaphorical parallel between Delannoy's revolutionary ideals and the audacious spontaneity of his drawing style which he described as dynamic and "high-strung." Delannoy's most famous caricatures were also reprinted in the journal, including that of General d'Amade.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> After Delannoy's death <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> launched an appeal to artists to donate works of art for a raffle in support of Delannoy's destitute family: contributors included such luminaries as Charles Angrand, Maximilian Luce, Paul Signac, and most surprisingly, Henri Matisse.<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup></p>
<p>We can gain some idea of Delannoy's impact on Gaudier-Brzeska by considering the role of drawing and caricature in his artistic development. In April 1910, Gaudier started his "Chaos" sketchbook, and quickly populated it with caricatures and a vast number of human heads, some in profile, others in three-quarter profile, sketched from life.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> He signaled his class allegiances by labeling a portrait of a male with a high forehead and an opulent beard and mustache "a bourgeois scoundrel," while another was simply titled "worker." Clearly Gaudier-Brzeska was compiling an inventory of social types, and his preoccupation with portraiture may have been in emulation of Delannoy's ongoing series of portrait busts commissioned for <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>. In a letter written on the May 19, 1911, the sculptor emulated Guilbeaux's correlation between Delannoy's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> loose drawing style and his anarchist ideals by positing his own version of libertarian aesthetics. Gaudier-Brzeska claimed that artists seeking a hard-edged "purity of line" on the model of Neoclassicists like John Flaxman were "opposed to individual freedom" for "the outline is only a purely imaginary thing" whose sole purpose is to "contain the planes of the mass, receiving light and shade."<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> This declaration brings to mind the flowing, tremulous lines in Delannoy's reportage caricature of the jail hairdresser and another of a resting prisoner, "Le Repos de Juste," [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 12</a>] reproduced in the March 17, 1911 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>Indeed portraiture—and caricature—would continue to be a major theme in Gaudier-Brzeska's oeuvre throughout his short life. Gaudier arguably arrived at a sculptural equivalent to Delannoy's satirical images of the French military in his portrait bust of Raymond Smythies, a fifty-two year old retired Major whom Sophie Brzeska christened "Colonel Squeeze."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska met Symthies through his contact with Haldane MacFall, another retired officer and early patron whom Gaudier-Brzeska  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> derisively described as having "an atrocious mouth, a cow-like head… and a mustache à la Guillaume d'Allemagne."<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> As an anti-militarist Gaudier was clearly uncomfortable with these prospective clients. While Smythies sat for his portrait in the winter of 1912, the sculptor repeatedly provoked the Major through his coarse behavior. During the sittings, Gaudier apparently hollowed out a cavity in the cranium of the clay bust into which he repeatedly deposited copious amounts of spit: the Major was reportedly "horrified and disgusted."<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup> As O'Keeffe notes, the sculpted bust—finished in March 1912—cast Symthies as a pompous military man [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 13</a>]: "The sitter's pugnacious military bearing was conveyed by the moustache-caked upper lip and the slight upward tilting of the heavy jowls and chin, elevating the tip of the nose to the point almost level with the eyes."<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup> Smythies physiognomy recalls that of Delannoy's equally unflattering caricatures of his jailers, with their exaggerated mustaches, pig-like noses, and bloated facial features [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 14</a>].</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Gaudier-Brzeska's anti-militarism</h1>
<p>As Gaudier-Brzeska's October 1912 enlistment date approached, he repeatedly reiterated his opposition to the military in language that emulated the belligerent tone of Hervé and his colleagues. He also alluded to military scandals highlighted by <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>. For instance on June 18, 1912 the sculptor informed Dr. Uhlemayr that, if conscripted, he would "never bend" his will "to the commands of an officer," with the result that "they would probably send me to a disciplining company in Morocco," where he would die.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska's gloomy description was undoubtedly a response to the series of articles published in <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span> over 1911–12, detailing the military's attempt to cover up the inhumane treatment—frequently resulting in death—of unruly leftist conscripts who were sent to such prison battalions in Africa, known in French argot as "Biribi."<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup> On October 11, 1912, he informed Sophie that he had officially defaulted on his military service as of three o'clock that afternoon, concluding, "[M]ay the good sun burst all the officers of this filthy regiment!"<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup> Less than a week later the sculptor outlined his Hervéist rebuttal of letters sent by his family and the Mayor of his native village of St-Jean-de-Braye, imploring him to reconsider his decision.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Writing on October 16, 1912, he declared his sadness that "the youth of France had not revolted en masse against the abominable conscription," that he couldn't help inveighing to his mother about "all the prejudices with which the rich stuff the poor in order to keep them in slavery," and that he did not "recognize any patriotic duty" to fulfill his military service.<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87">87</a></sup> Anti-patriotism was very much on Gaudier-Brzeska's mind in his caustic reply to the town Mayor, Monsieur Galloueder, who implored him not to follow the example of the famous playwright Henri Bernstein. Bernstein, the mayor reported, had shirked his military service only to make a humiliating public apology when news of his "cowardice" emerged in the press.<sup><a name="f88-text" href="#f88">88</a></sup> Gaudier-Brzeska was well aware of Bernstein, having read Victor Méric's withering response to the playwright's public apology in the March 4, 1911 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>. The sculptor's icy reply assured the Mayor that he would not behave like Bernstein but instead acquire British citizenship before heading to Germany in order to subject the Mayor to "the pitiable spectacle of seeing a French artist erecting a monument to commemorate a French defeat." Gustave Hervé had first scandalized the French public by publishing an article in 1901 calling on French regiments to commemorate Napoleon's victory over the Austrians at Wagram by planting their regimental flags in a pile of horse manure, and Gaudier-Brzeska clearly hoped to emulate the outlandishness of Hervé's anti-militarist declaration.<sup><a name="f89-text" href="#f89">89</a></sup> By informing the Mayor of his intent to sculpt a monument celebrating an anticipated French defeat at the hands of the Germans, Gaudier-Brzeska threatened to further shame the village and its inhabitants by using his skills as an artist to create a public scandal.</p>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska conveyed his anti-militarist convictions to his political confidant Dr. Uhlemayr in letters dated January 6 and March 12, 1913, but due to the loss of much of his correspondence, we do not know how his ideas evolved after that date.<sup><a name="f90-text" href="#f90">90</a></sup> This silence is all the more startling given Gaudier-Brzeska's eagerness to enlist following the outbreak of World War One in early August 1914. While scholars have rightly pointed to the impact of res like Hulme on the sculptor's thinking as the threat of war intensified,<sup><a name="f91-text" href="#f91">91</a></sup> no one has addressed the relation of Gaudier-Brzeska's rejection of anti-militarism to the Hervéist movement that served to define his anarchist convictions. In fact the French sculptor was not alone in refuting anti-militarism, for Hervé had undergone a similar transformation following his release from prison in July 1912.</p>
<p>Beginning in Autumn 1912, Hervé now argued that anarchists and socialists should reform the army from within rather than destroy it <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>. He called for the French army to return to its Jacobin roots, claiming that the same patriotic and revolutionary spirit that animated the Republican Guards during the Commune could serve as the guiding light for the French army in his own day.<sup><a name="f92-text" href="#f92">92</a></sup> In a <span style="font-style:italic;">Guerre sociale</span> article titled "14 July 1913," published the following year, Hervé proclaimed his patriotic allegiance to Republicanism as a counterweight to the conservative nationalism of the French Right.<sup><a name="f93-text" href="#f93">93</a></sup> Such pronouncements proved too much for his leftist colleagues Almereyda and Merle, who denounced Hervéism, and founded the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonnet Rouge</span> in November 1913 to promote anarchist anti-militarism.<sup><a name="f94-text" href="#f94">94</a></sup> By 1914, Hervé had not only rejected the idea of an insurrection in the case of war, he had given up on revolutionary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> anti-militarism: thus on August 2, 1914, the first day of French mobilization, Hervé publically declared his own desire to enlist on <span style="font-style:italic;">La Guerre sociale</span>'s front page, concluding with the strident declaration "Long Live France!"<sup><a name="f95-text" href="#f95">95</a></sup> In Hervé's view, France was the guardian of republican values, Germany by contrast was a bastion of Prussian militarism. Thus the defense of France amounted to a defense of the revolutionary tradition and European civilization as such. Over the previous months, French anarchists and socialists had tried desperately to reach an international consensus on how to react to the declaration of war. When their efforts ended in failure, most of the French Left took up Hervé's position. Thus Almereyda's <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonnet Rouge</span> ran the headline "To Arms, Citizens!" on August 3, 1914, while the anarcho-syndicalist <span style="font-style:italic;">La Bataille syndicaliste</span> proclaimed that it was necessary "to save the democratic and revolutionary tradition of France" against "the right of the fist, against German militarism."<sup><a name="f96-text" href="#f96">96</a></sup> Even the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, whom Gaudier-Brzeska idolized, took up the patriotic line, along with prominent French anarchists like Jean Grave and Charles Malato.<sup><a name="f97-text" href="#f97">97</a></sup> Since Kropotkin resided in London, his pro-war declaration was widely publicized in the British press. A similar fate befell <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span>, which—following Méric's forced conscription under police escort<sup><a name="f98-text" href="#f98">98</a></sup>—quickly endorsed Hervé's position. Having sanctioned the Third Republic's war against Germany as a defense of the republican and socialist tradition, the French Left then added culture to the equation, thereby drawing a clear cut correlation between violence and aesthetics that departed dramatically from their previous commitment to anti-militarism.</p>
<p>Over the Fall of 1914, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> joined prominent socialist and anarchist journals in decrying the German bombardment of Reims Cathedral in September 1914.<sup><a name="f99-text" href="#f99">99</a></sup> Even Romain Rolland, France's most prominent wartime pacifist, mourned the Cathedral's destruction, writing in 1915 while in exile in Switzerland that Reims represented "[the life] of a people whose centuries vibrate like a symphony in this organ of stone".<sup><a name="f100-text" href="#f100">100</a></sup> Historians have noted the frequent comparison made by key res on the French left between the medieval guilds who built the cathedrals and contemporary labor unions.<sup><a name="f101-text" href="#f101">101</a></sup> Before the war, French syndicalists claimed that cathedrals such as Reims were the cultural birthright of the French proletariat, and in the Fall of 1914, these same leftists pointed to the destruction of Reims as evidence of the Kaiser's barbaric hostility towards the people of France, whose Republican values were now in peril. <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Hommes du jour</span> reinforced this message in the October 1914 edition by pairing images of the Cathedral's destruction with the bitter caption, "How the Boches [Germans] apply civilization in the name of German culture."</p>
<p>Such leftist associations also pertain to this wartime postcard of Reims after the German bombardment [<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 15</a>], which highlighted the survival of a sculpted Gallic cock in the lower right of the cathedral as evidence of the fortitude and ultimate triumph of France in the face of the German onslaught. The import of the rooster was made explicit by the inclusion of a caption, published in French and English: "A Symbol—Over the fired streets, the French cock is always standing." Before the war, French anarchists had made symbolic use of the rooster as a herald announcing the anarchist new dawn, and as a symbol of revolution, since roosters will t to the death.<sup><a name="f102-text" href="#f102">102</a></sup> Thus  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in addition to being a generic emblem of the people of France, the humble rooster signified the anarchist battle against capitalism. This sculpted rooster, perched on this medieval cathedral, would have been a powerful symbol of the French left's new-found patriotism.<sup><a name="f103-text" href="#f103">103</a></sup> Such associations undoubtedly resonated for any anarchist serving on the front lines: thus it is all the more telling that Gaudier-Brzeska mailed this patriotic postcard to Ezra Pound from the trenches in December 1914.<sup><a name="f104-text" href="#f104">104</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Aestheticized Violence from Left to Right</h1>
<p>In reflecting on Gaudier-Brzeska's trajectory from anarchist anti-militarist to French patriot, what is most striking is the role of violence and morality in shaping his development as an artist and self-styled revolutionary. As we have seen, in Europe before World War One, concepts of class, nationhood, ethics, and aesthetics, were utilized to define acceptable and unacceptable forms of violence. With regard to class, the contested image of the Apache acted as a lightning rod. For the bourgeoisie, the government, and the mainstream press, the Parisian Apache was an immoral criminal who committed random acts of violence. Thus the term "Apache" signified a kind of primitive barbarism that identified res like Liabeuf not only as a threat to the rule of law, but to civilization itself. In response the anarchists argued that such acts were not indiscriminate, but instead ethically motivated. Hervé and Méric claimed that Liabeuf had chosen to defend the dignity of his lover and their relationship, which had been sullied by the police. In this logic, the Apache ironically followed a code similar to that of the French upper classes, whose duels and other ritualized forms of violence were enacted when issues of honor were at stake.<sup><a name="f105-text" href="#f105">105</a></sup> Such thinking accounts for writer Anatole France's surprising claim that the Apaches represented "the last remnant of the days of chivalry, they being the only men left given to indulge in duels to the death for a fair one's lover."<sup><a name="f106-text" href="#f106">106</a></sup> While Hervé and Méric would have never compared Liabeuf to a Medieval aristocrat, they did use metaphorical language that reiterated bourgeois codes for honorable conflict: thus Liabeuf's battle on behalf of his lover is described as possessing "a certain grandeur," and he faced his impending execution with a "beautiful bearing." Such passions were further domesticated by means of the commercialized Apache dance, which proved so alluring to the French and English bourgeoisie. Gaudier and his Vorticist friends arguably conjured with the ambivalent status of the Apache in the public imagination, though the anarchist Gaudier differed tellingly from Wyndham Lewis in endorsing Apache street violence rather than bourgeois fantasies about Apache seduction on the dance floor.</p>
<p>Where the anarchists departed from writers like Anatole France was in claiming that such aestheticized violence should be extended to include forms of retribution against the police and society in general. When the anarchist Laurent Tailhade responded to the bombing of the Chamber of Deputies with the pronouncement, "What do the victims matter if the gesture is beautiful?," he asserted the anarchist right to commit <span style="font-style:italic;">depersonalized</span> acts of violence,<sup><a name="f107-text" href="#f107">107</a></sup> whose moral justification resided in the injustice inflicted by plutocratic capitalism on its working-class victims. The State responded to such violence by executing the perpetrators, whom the anarchists promptly labeled martyrs to the cause.<sup><a name="f108-text" href="#f108">108</a></sup></p>
<p>The battle over who was justified in committing acts of symbolic violence was extended to encompass art when the anarchists set out to challenge the French government's punitive censorship laws. By claiming that its military institutions were honorable and therefore not subject to defamation, the government opened itself up to the kind of satirical critique developed by artists like Delannoy in his portrait of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> General d'Amade, or by Hervé in his call for soldiers to plant their regimental flags in horse manure. Gaudier-Brzeska sided with Hervé, and his decision to refuse his military service was a direct response to the military's Moroccan campaign as well as the government's persecution of Delannoy. Gaudier's portrait bust of Major Smythies and his projected monument commemorating a French military defeat, arguably represent his own attempt to dishonor the military as well as the concept of <span style="font-style:italic;">patrie</span>.</p>
<p>In August 1914, these discursive terms underwent radical revision as the French left merged its justification for violence with the moral codes deployed by the French government in its war against Germany. Whereas these anarchists had previously pitted their aesthetic violence against the barbarism of the French State, they now transformed the politics of class war into a cultural narrative concerning war between nations. The Germans were now cast as cruel and despotic, while the acts of violence undertaken by the French military took on the moral rectitude and heroism previously reserved for res like the Apache Liabeuf. To signal their moral superiority over their German adversaries, anarchists along with main stream Republicans seized on the bombardment of Reims Cathedral as evidence of the aesthetic dimension of their struggle to defend culture as such. In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Reflections on Violence</span>, the anarcho-syndicalist Georges Sorel had claimed that proletarian violence ultimately served the "time honored interests of civilization"<sup><a name="f109-text" href="#f109">109</a></sup>; after war broke out in August 1914, the left extended this civilizing mission to include total war against Germany. Shortly after his decision to enlist, Sophie Brzeska recalled that Gaudier too justified his new-found patriotism by melding the defense of France with that of European culture: "This is no longer a political war," Gaudier declared, "It is a matter of saving civilization before these bastards destroy all works of Art."<sup><a name="f110-text" href="#f110">110</a></sup></p>
<p>Gaudier-Brzeska's decision to enlist, therefore, did not necessarily signal his rejection of anarchism and Hervéism, but quite possibly was just one example of the painful choices made by adherents of anti-militarism over whether to support the republican tradition. No French citizen on the Left in August 1914 could have foreseen that the revolutionary values justifying this so-called <span style="font-style:italic;">union sacrée</span> would dissipate under the impact of the war itself. Thus Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, like so many others, rallied to the call of "<span style="font-style:italic;">leur patrie</span>," to find tragically that Hervé's earlier assessment of that mobilizing myth was closer to the truth.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>In a March 1910 letter to Dr. Uhlemayr, his German confidant, Gaudier-Brzeska declared "I am an anarchist in my soul;" in October of the same year he re-affirmed his status as an anarchist, stating that he was forming "an anti-parliamentary insurrectional committee, who have in view a revolution only possible by force;" and in December 1912 he wrote to Sophie Brzeska of his veneration for the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> famous Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin. See H.S. Ede, <span style="font-style:italic;">Savage Messiah: Gaudier-Brzeska</span> (New York: The Literary Guild, 1931), 24–26, 38–42; 203–204, 217.</p></div>

Beasley and Sherry are subtle and exacting in their analysis of Pound's ideological development, but they do not scrutinize Gaudier's own cultural politics. The excellent scholarship on the anarchism of the Vorticist circle has likewise been restricted to analyses of the impact of the anarcho-syndicalist Georges Sorel on T.E. Hulme or else to the influence of the anarcho-individualism promoted in Dora Marsden's journals <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Freewoman</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> (1914–19) on Lewis and Pound. On anarcho-individualism and Vorticism see for instance, Bruce Clarke, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dora Marsden and Early Modernism: Gender, Individualism, Science</span> (Ann Arbor, MI:University of Michigan Press, 1996); David Kadlec, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mosaic Modernism: Anarchism, Pragmatism, Culture</span> (London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000); Paul Peppis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Literature, Politics, and the English Avant-Garde: Nation and Empire, 1901–1918</span> (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2000); and Robert von Hallberg, "Libertarian Imagism," <span style="font-style:italic;"></span> 2, no. 2 (April 1995): 63–79.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f40" href="#f40-text">40. </a>In reviewing literary representations of the Apache, Haine concludes that "rather than overthrow middle-class society, the Apaches, through their bohemian interpreters, helped expand the definition of middle-class society by inspiring new styles of dress, speech, and dance. The Apaches show that working-class violence or deviance could be a subject not simply of condemnation but also of commercialization." Haine, 463. Haine's thesis, which follows that of Jerrold Seigel, does not take account of the politically informed defense of the Apache operative in anarchist circles in Paris; moreover I would argue that Gaudier's embrace of an Apache persona was as much a legacy of his anarchism as exposure to the bohemian world of Lewis's London.

This ideological declaration—made to his lover Sophie Brzeska and to his immediate family—stands in stark contrast to the explanation apparently given to his patron, the retired military officer Haldane MacFall. In a letter to Horace Brodzky dated October 2, 1919, MacFall recalled that Gaudier "came to me one day saying that he was ignoring his calling up papers for the French army" because "he could not face two years lost to sculpture." "Well I went into it very seriously with him—told him it was a hideous thing for a French artist to cut himself off from France, above all from Paris… However he decided to desert. But the moment the war broke out… it found him too much a Frenchman to forsake his people." MacFall's statement not only attests to his lack of awareness of Gaudier's anarchist convictions, but likely indicates the careful manner in which Gaudier justified his actions for a patron he deemed hostile to his political beliefs. Gaudier evidently thought the noble calling of art, rather than anarchist anti-militarism, suitable justification for his refusal in enlist in the eyes of MacFall.

While working on <span style="font-style:italic;">Savage Messiah</span>, Ede was able to draw on the Uhlemayr correspondence, but scholars have been unable to trace these documents and they are no longer on deposit at the Gaudier-Brzeska archives in Kettles Yard Gallery, University of Cambridge, or University of Essex, all of which hold Ede's papers. Roger Cole is apparently the last scholar to have made use of the original letters. His biography of Gaudier-Brzeska informs us that Uhlemayr had sent Ede a group of letters and cards from Gaudier, including drawings, which he asked to be returned to him. Cole however does not indicate how he gained access to this material or its present location.

On the back Gaudier writes to thank Pound for sending him a sweater and a pack of cigarettes; he also notes that "we killed a German a few days ago." Paul O'Keeffe conjectures that Gaudier may have sent the postcard to Pound because the English caption concerning the French cock "must have been liable to vulgar innuendo" (O'Keeffe, 272); however given the ideological import of the Gallic rooster at this historical juncture that interpretation seems reductive and lacking in nuance. Gaudier sent another wartime postcard of the Cathedral, which pictured Reims before its destruction, to Katie Smith on May 29, 1915. On this postcard he noted that he was writing while "covered with earth" in the midst of an intense German bombardment. This postcard is included in the Gaudier Brzeska-Katie Smith correspondence at the Hyman Kreitman Research Center, housed at Tate Gallery Archive.

Followers of the anarcho-communism of Peter Kro-potkin tended to endorse the former position, while proponents of the anarcho-individualism of Max Stirner defended indiscriminate acts of violence.
